    "the detection by the future _ laser interferometric space antenna _ ( _ lisa _ ) of gravitational waves ( gw ) emitted during the coalescence of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the mass range @xmath4@xmath5 will constitute a milestone for fundamental physics and astrophysics .",
    "high angular resolution observations of the nuclei of several dozen galaxies over the past several years have revealed that supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are ubiquitous in local galaxies ( see , e.g. , the review by @xcite ) .",
    "mergers are expected to play an important role in the formation and evolution of smbhs on cosmological time  scales .",
    "the number of events that will be detectable by _ lisa _ is uncertain by orders of magnitude , depending on model assumptions @xcite .",
    "however , for many events in the above mass and redshift range , _ lisa _ would be able to measure the masses and spin vectors of the smbhs , their orbital parameters , and their luminosity distance , to a precision unprecedented in any other type of astronomical observation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to providing crucial new information for hierarchical structure formation scenarios and black hole astrophysics , the observation of these gw sources would offer new tests of general relativity and cosmology @xcite .",
    "while the gw signatures themselves are a rich source of information , the secure identification of the lisa source in electromagnetic ( em ) wavebands would enable a host of new applications .",
    "traditional astronomical tools could be used to study the nature of these sources in detail , clarifying how the smbhs grow , evolve , and affect their galaxy environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the simultaneous study of photons and gravitons from a single source would also likely probe fundamental aspects of gravitational physics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the single most important unresolved issue is whether counterparts to _ lisa _ sources will , in fact , be found in electromagnetic ( em ) wavebands . the final angular localization by _",
    "lisa _ itself",
    "is relatively poor ( typically a few @xmath6 0.1 square degrees at merger ) , and early studies on counterparts pointed out that this large solid angle will contain many thousands of galaxies , suggesting that identifying the galactic host of the coalescing smbhs will be difficult , or impossible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , recent work has reached much more optimistic conclusions . using _ lisa _ s localization of the source within a 3-d error volume ( rather than 2-d sky position ) reduces the number of candidate galaxies by @xmath7 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the coalescing smbhs themselves produce bright emission ( such as bright quasars ) , or are associated with some other , similarly rare subset of all galaxies ( such as ultra  luminous infrared galaxies [ ulirgs ] , whose large infrared luminosity may arise from the galaxy merger process that also causes the smbh binary coalescence ) , then the identification of a unique counterpart may become feasible for a typical _ lisa _ source @xcite .    another possibility , raised by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , is to monitor the sky for em counterparts in real time , even as the smbh inspiral proceeds .",
    "various strategies to carry out this monitoring effort are the subject of the present follow  up paper . if the exact nature of counterparts or host galaxies were securely known from ab ",
    "initio models , then one could hope to identify them post - merger , e.g. based on the peculiar photometric or spectroscopic signatures . however , such ab ",
    "initio predictions are difficult . searching for a variable or transient em signal produced during the timed gw ",
    "emitting phase could be the most efficient way to identify a secure em counterpart .",
    "the presence of gas is believed to promote the rapid coalescence of a smbh binary ( see , e.g. , @xcite , but see @xcite and the review by @xcite for the possibility of coalescence without gas , through stellar dynamical processes ) . if one or both smbhs continue(s ) to accrete gas in the gw - emitting stage , for instance , the coalescing binary may shine as a bright quasar @xcite with potential variability on a timescale of @xmath8 hours to days , owing to the inspiraling orbital motion of the binary .",
    "this differs from post - merger counterpart scenarios .",
    "for example , the merger of two nearly equal  mass smbhs embedded in a thin accretion disk with a central gap may be expected to produce an x - ray afterglow , delayed by a disk viscous time relative to the merger , i.e. possibly @xmath9 years later  @xcite .",
    "importantly for prompt counterpart scenarios , the power emitted in gws during the final hours of the coalescence is very large , exceeding @xmath10 . as a result ,",
    "any coupling of even a small fraction of this unprecedentedly large power to the surrounding gas could produce a luminous counterpart , possibly in the form of a variable em source .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in paper i we developed a formalism ( which we call the harmonic mode decomposition , or hmd method ) to efficiently compute the time ",
    "dependent 3d localization information contained in the _ lisa _ data stream .",
    "we presented an in - depth study of the potential for pre - merger localizations over the large parameter space of potential sources .",
    "in particular , we showed that using the gw inspiral signal accumulated up to some look  back time , @xmath11 , preceding the final coalescence , one already has a good partial knowledge of the sky position and radial distance to the gw source . indeed , since the sky position is deduced primarily from the detector s motion around the sun , we found that angular positioning uncertainties are such that often a source can be localized to within a few square degrees several weeks prior to merger .",
    "these conclusions have been confirmed in a recent study @xcite that included the additional effects of spin precession and parameter cross  correlations .",
    "these effects , which are ignored in our work , impact localization errors only several days or less prior to merger ( resulting in significant improvements at late times ) .",
    "the main proposal put forward here is to search for an em counterpart by monitoring lisa source candidates in the @xmath12@xmath13 weeks preceding the merger .",
    "we emphasize that in this context , the relevant criterion is not the comparison between the number density of potential counterparts and the _ lisa _ error box ( @xmath14 in a typical case ) , but the much less stringent requirement that the _ lisa _ uncertainty be comparable to the field of view ( fov ) of a wide - field survey instrument ( say , @xmath0 , such as planned for the large synoptic survey telescope , lsst ) below . ] .",
    "if this requirement is met , it would be possible to use such an instrument to monitor _ lisa _ counterpart candidates in real time , during the final stages of the bh merger .",
    "the goal of the present paper is ( i ) to discuss , quantitatively , the feasibility of such a prompt em counterpart search , and ( ii ) to identify the issues that will likely drive the observational strategies . in particular , we derive source position uncertainties as a function of time using the results of paper i , and investigate survey strategies to best utilize this localization information .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : paper1 ] , we summarize and expand on the results of paper i and present time ",
    "dependent _ lisa _ sky position errors . in ",
    "[ sec : monitoring ] , we discuss the possibility of identifying the em counterpart of the _ lisa _ source by monitoring the merger with a wide field astronomical instrument . in ",
    "[ sec : graviton ] , we discuss the additional science that would be allowed by a real  time em counterpart identification ( as opposed to identifying a counterpart post  merger ) . in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , we summarize the implications of our findings and conclude .",
    "the first and most fundamental question in searching for prompt em counterparts is the accuracy to which the _ lisa _ source can be localized at various look  back times prior to the coalescence . in this section ,",
    "we present these time  dependent uncertainties .",
    "we use the harmonic mode decomposition method described in paper i. the reader is referred to that paper for details about the method ; here , for completeness , we summarize the main assumptions before describing relevant results .      1 .   in general , an smbh inspiral is described by a total of 17 parameters .",
    "these include 2 redshifted mass parameters , and @xmath15 , the total mass is @xmath16 , the reduced mass is @xmath17 , the symmetric mass ratio is @xmath18 and the chirp mass is defined as @xmath19 @xcite , with redshifted masses written as @xmath20 .",
    "] @xmath21 , 6 parameters related to the bh spin vectors , @xmath22 , the orbital eccentricity , @xmath23 , the source luminosity distance , @xmath24 , 2 angles locating the source on the sky , @xmath25 , 2 angles that describe the relative orientation of the binary orbit , @xmath26 , a reference time and a reference phase at merger , i.e. at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and , finally , the instantaneous orbital phase , @xmath29 ( which specifies the time - evolution of the binary ) .",
    "we denote the lookback time before merger by @xmath11 . throughout the paper",
    ", all time parameters will be quoted in redshifted units ( i.e. as measured by an observer on earth ) .",
    "the signal for a gw inspiral is determined by the above set of parameters and two additional angles describing the orientation of the _ lisa _ constellation , @xmath30 .",
    "note that these angles precess with time ; indeed , this time ",
    "dependence carries all of the sky localization information . since the period is precisely equal to _ lisa _ s orbital period of one year , we need to specify only some reference values ( e.g. chosen at the time of the merger , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "we use the circular , restricted post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation for the gw waveform @xcite keeping only the quadrupole gw harmonic for the gw amplitude .",
    "higher order gw harmonics are negligible if the quadrupole harmonic is within the lisa - frequency band for at least a few months , but can improve uncertainties for large mass binaries with @xmath33 and much shorter observation times @xcite .",
    "4 .   we neglect the effects of doppler phase modulation due to _ lisa _ s orbital motion which is an excellent approximation for smbh inspirals ( s. a. hughes , private communication , 2006 ; @xcite ) . 5 .",
    "we neglect smbh spins and , in particular , neglect the spin ",
    "orbit precession for determinations of the angular parameters .",
    "this assumption is useful in simplifying our equations and in focusing on the behavior of pure angular modulation . including the effect of spin helps reduce uncertainties in the final days and hours of the coalescence @xcite .",
    "we assume circular orbits ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "although eccentricity is efficiently damped by gravitational radiation reaction @xcite , the presence of gaseous circumbinary disks could lead to non - zero eccentricities for at least some _ lisa _ inspiral events @xcite . for highly eccentric orbits ,",
    "higher order harmonics appear in the gw phase , which could again lead to improved errors .",
    "we fix the start of _ lisa _ observations at a look  back time @xmath35 prior to merger .",
    "( see paper i ) . ]",
    "this corresponds to the time when the gw inspiral frequency @xmath36 crosses the low frequency noise wall of the detector at @xmath37 , but we limit the initial look ",
    "back time to a maximum of @xmath38 before merger . 8 .",
    "we assume that the slow annual amplitude modulation due to _ lisa _ s orbital motion can be used to determine the luminosity distance and angular parameters , @xmath39 , while the other remaining parameters , @xmath40 , are determined independently from the high frequency gw phase , with negligible cross - correlation between the two sets of parameters .",
    "this has been verified to be a good assumption up to a few days prior to isco , with cross  correlations increasing the localization errors only by a few tens of @xmath41 .",
    "closer to merger , however , cross - correlations can increase final errors at isco by a factor of 2 - 3 @xcite .",
    "we follow @xcite in calculating the spectral noise density , @xmath42 , which includes the instrumental noise as well as galactic / extra - galactic backgrounds . for the instrumental noise",
    ", we use the effective non - angular averaged online _",
    "sensitivity curve generatorshane / sensitivity/ ] @xcite , while we use the isotropic formulae for the galactic and extra - galactic background @xcite .",
    "we do not consider errors from possible theoretical uncertainties @xcite , which are negligible at look - back times @xmath11 well before @xmath27 , when the binary separations @xmath43 .",
    "we estimate the expected parameter uncertainties using the fisher matrix approach , using the harmonic mode decomposition ( hmd ) method developed in paper i ( essentially a discrete fourier transform of the gw waveform with fundamental frequency yr@xmath44 corresponding to the orbital period of the detector ) .",
    "the main advantage of the hmd method is that the time  dependence of errors can be extracted independently of the specific smbh binary orbital elements , reducing the computation time by many orders of magnitude .",
    "this allows us to survey simultaneously the dependencies on source sky position , smbh masses and redshift .",
    "we carry out monte  carlo ( mc ) calculations with @xmath45 random samples for the angles @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . here",
    "@xmath48 is a time - independent combination of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , defined as @xmath51 .",
    "the angles are defined relative to lisa s orbital plane ( i.e. , relative to the ecliptic ) , with @xmath52 and @xmath53 referring to polar and @xmath54 and @xmath55 referring to azimuthal coordinates .",
    "several thousand values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are considered , in the range @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "in addition , we ran specific mc calculations to study possible systematic effects with respect to the source sky position ( on a grid of several hundred values ) .        with the above assumptions , we obtain the two  dimensional sky position error ellipses .",
    "the time  evolving @xmath60 errors on the size of the ellipse are shown for a few examples in figure  [ f : errortau ] . errors .",
    "higher confidence levels will obviously require covering proportionately larger areas .",
    "] we also note that the fisher matrix approach , by construction , approximates the sky position errors ( and all other parameter uncertainties ) by ellipses .",
    "this approximation has been shown for the @xmath60 uncertainties to be in excellent agreement with the posterior probability distributions for the slow parameters determined from monte carlo markov chain and bayesian methods @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f : errortau ] shows the gradual improvement in localization , for smbh coalescences with six different fixed mass and redshift combinations , in the form of the major axis ( @xmath61 ) , minor axis ( @xmath62 ) and equivalent diameter ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "+    figure  [ f : errortau ] displays results for three separate cumulative probability distribution levels , @xmath64 , so that @xmath65 refers to the best @xmath65 of all events , as sampled by the random distribution of the five angular parameters .",
    "note that the levels refer to the parameter in question ( i.e. the 10% of all events for which @xmath66 is best  measured , in general , is different from the 10% of the events for which @xmath67 is best measured ) , so eccentricities can not be directly read off from this figure .",
    "the evolution of errors scales steeply with look  back time for @xmath68 . for smaller",
    "look  back times , errors essentially stop improving in the `` worst '' ( @xmath69 level ) case , improve with a relatively shallow slope for the `` typical '' ( @xmath70 level ) case , and improve more steeply in the `` best '' case ( @xmath65 level among the realizations of fiducial angular parameters ) .",
    "these behaviors are explained in paper i ; the minor - axis best case approaches the simple @xmath71 scaling expected in the absence of parameter degeneracies .",
    "+     +    in figures  [ f : snapshot_a ] and [ f : snapshot_b ] , we show the probability distribution for the errors @xmath61 and @xmath62 in logarithmic bins at 4 different snapshots : at isco , and at 1 , 7 , and 28 days before merger , using @xmath72 random binaries .",
    "these distributions are broad , spanning 12 orders of magnitude .",
    "they are generally asymmetric , skewed right or left for the major and minor axis , respectively .",
    "the distribution evolves with look  back time : it is initially peaked , gets flatter and broader approaching merger , and develops a bimodal structure with two peaks .",
    "this bimodal nature of the distribution at isco is also visible in the histograms of @xcite , which our figures  [ f : snapshot_a ] and [ f : snapshot_b ] confirm at high resolution .",
    "the wide distributions suggest a non  negligible chance of being lucky / unlucky and finding a very well / poorly localized source .",
    "figures  [ f : errortau ] , [ f : snapshot_a ] and [ f : snapshot_b ] suggest that the 2d sky localization error ellipsoid is initially circular ( @xmath73 ) , but the geometry changes significantly during the last stages of the merger . for example , in the typical case ( for @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) , in the last two weeks , the major axis improves much more slowly than the minor axis . the effect is much more pronounced at lower masses .",
    "as the left panels show , the major axis essentially stops improving within the last @xmath8day , while the minor axis maintains a steep evolution , so that the eccentricity of the 2d angular error ellipsoid changes rapidly ( in fact this behavior is even more pronounced if spin precession effects are included , @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the error ellipse , in general , changes its eccentricity and its orientation may need to be taken into account in observational strategies ( although , of course , as time evolves , subsequent error ellipsoids always lie entirely within the earlier error ellipsoids ) .",
    "+    figure  [ f : ecc ] shows the time ",
    "evolution of the axis ratio @xmath76 of the 2d angular error ellipsoids for the same mass / redshift combinations as in figures  [ f : errortau][f : snapshot_b ] . to look for possible correlations between size and eccentricity , we first sorted all binaries according to the total area of the error ellipse into three bins , containing the `` small '' , `` medium '' , and `` large '' ellipsoids , corresponding to 020% , 4060% , and 80100% of all events ranked by the instantaneous value of @xmath77",
    ". figure  [ f : ecc ] then shows the evolution of the 10 , 50 , and 90 percentiles in eccentricity in each of these three bins separately .",
    "the shaded region highlights the distribution of medium ",
    "sized ellipsoids , and the thick curves correspond to the median ( 50% ) eccentricities in each bin .",
    "depending on the binary parameters , we find a systematic trend between the size and eccentricity of the angular error ellipsoid .",
    "figure  [ f : ecc ] shows that if the ellipsoid is relatively small 3 months before merger , then it is very circular , while the larger ellipsoids are more eccentric , but subsequently , at a few days before isco , the smaller ellipsoids become just as eccentric as the big ones .",
    "overall , figure  [ f : ecc ] shows that the eccentricity evolution of the angular error ellipsoid is complicated , but that at the most relevant epochs , i.e. in the last two weeks prior to merger , when the absolute errors have shrunk to interesting levels , the eccentricity increases but remains small until the final day .",
    "more specifically , figure [ f : ecc ] shows that the eccentricity is significant in the beginning , in the first few weeks after the binary enters _ lisa _ s frequency band .",
    "however , the error ellipse then soon `` circularizes '' , and the eccentricity remains small until the last day before merger .",
    "the typical axis ratio decreases below 1.3 , 1.1 , and 1.01 after two months of observation for the large , medium and small ellipses , respectively . except for the large ellipses",
    ", the eccentricity tends to increase again in the last week before merger .",
    "the axis ratio is typically under 1.3 before the last day to merger , with a @xmath65 probability for @xmath78 .      for high @xmath79 values ,",
    "the signal frequency at isco is low , and the binary coalesces soon after it enters _ lisa _ s frequency band .",
    "for example , the inspiral of a binary with @xmath80 and @xmath81 can only be observed for less than 10 days . in such cases ,",
    "the sky localization eccentricity does not have time to circularize and the eccentricity remains high ( typically @xmath82@xmath83 ) throughout the entire observation .",
    "we note however , that higher order gw harmonics beyond the restricted post - newtonian approximation become relevant in this case , since these harmonics are inside the lisa frequency band much sooner .",
    "this improves angular errors greatly for the high mass binaries @xcite .",
    "due to the increase in observation time , we expect higher gw harmonics to circularize the angular ellipsoid for the more massive binaries .",
    "although figures  [ f : errortau][f : ecc ] correspond to equal mass binaries , we also ran simulations for other mass ratios , @xmath84 , and found very similar results .",
    "a plausible explanation is that two competing effects approximately cancel each other : ( 1 ) for fixed total mass @xmath56 but lower mass ratio @xmath85 , the instantaneous signal amplitude is lower ( @xmath86 ) while ( 2 ) the frequency evolves at a slower rate ( @xmath87 and the frequency at isco is independent of @xmath85 ) implying that the binary spends more time at larger frequencies where the detector is more sensitive .",
    "relative to the equal mass case , these competing effects approximately cancel out for @xmath88 for both the size and eccentricity of the angular error ellipse .",
    "we find differences only for the high mass systems where the total observation time is much larger for @xmath88 , leading to a smaller angular error ellipsoid and lower eccentricity .",
    "we expect this description to hold when including spin effects until the final day prior to merger if the observation time is at least months . for high spin binaries ,",
    "however , spin precession is expected to add an important extra feature to the waveform during the last day which improves the final measurement angular errors by a factor of @xmath89 @xcite . in this case",
    ", we expect spin precession effects to further increase the angular error eccentricity during the last day . indeed ,",
    "recent results by @xcite show that the minor axis acquires a long tail toward small values , @xmath90@xmath91 , indicating that the best events at isco will possibly be very elliptic . on the other hand , including spin precession reduces the error eccentricity compared to our estimates if the total observation time is less than a month ( r. n. lang , private communication , 2007 ) .",
    "therefore , spin precession effects will have a tremendous impact on em follow  up observations , allowing a 1dimensional tiling of the field with small fov instruments at late times .      figures  [ f : errortau ] and [ f : ecc ] show the basic statistics of the expected localization errors when all six angular parameters ( 2 sky position , 2 angular momentum orientation , and 2 detector orientation parameters ) are chosen randomly . ) .",
    "] this is useful to get an idea of the range of possible accuracies we may have when the lisa data becomes available .",
    "it is also interesting to calculate how the lisa localization errors depend on the actual sky position of the source , since em counterpart detections can have very different prospects , depending on this position .",
    "for instance , it might be difficult to find a counterpart if it lies in the galactic plane , due to astrophysical foregrounds .",
    "on the other hand , a specific example of a preferred direction could be the lockman hole , where the obscuring neutral hydrogen column density is anomalously low .    to examine possible systematic effects with respect to the fiducial sky position",
    ", we have divided the @xmath92 sky into cells and calculated the distribution of errors for each cell by choosing the remaining angular parameters randomly .",
    "surprisingly , in a previous work , @xcite showed that no significant trends exist at isco as a function of the polar angle @xmath52 .",
    "our computations ( for @xmath93 and @xmath94 at @xmath74 ) confirm this result to the 10% level , throughout the final 6 months of observation .",
    "( median errors systematically get just slightly worse by less than 10% for sources that lie towards the ecliptic . )",
    "moreover , we find that localization uncertainties are independent of @xmath54 .",
    "this , however , is not surprising since in paper i we have shown that the lisa measurement depends on the combination @xmath95 , and is otherwise independent of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore the randomness of @xmath32 perfectly smears out any systematic effects with respect to @xmath54 .",
    "we note that @xcite find a very different @xmath52 dependence : they find ecliptic equatorial sources to have @xmath12 times larger angular uncertainties than sources near the poles at isco .",
    "although @xcite employ a different set of assumptions ( accounting for correlations and spins , and choosing @xmath96 at the start of the mission ) , these differences can not be responsible for the strong @xmath52dependence .",
    "the origin of this dependence therefore remains unclear to us .    on the other hand , it is plausible to expect systematic effects in both the ecliptic latitude and longitude if measuring the longitude relative to the detector position , @xmath97 .",
    "we find this to be a useful measure , since once the lisa plans are fixed , @xmath49 will be known , and @xmath97 can be converted to galactic coordinates for each @xmath54 and @xmath98 . for instance , depending on @xmath99 , it might turn out that a `` good lisa direction '' is in the galactic plane in january and july , but not during other months .",
    "we calculate error distributions for cells of size @xmath100 and find strong systematic effects : the median localization error improves mostly in the instantaneous lisa plane during the final month , and it is worst in the two orthogonal directions @xmath101 , given by @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "this result has also been found independently in a recent study by @xcite using non - restricted pn waveforms for high mass binaries .",
    "the angular resolution is worst orthogonal to the lisa plane due to geometry : as our viewing angle of the binary changes , due to lisa s orbital and rolling modulation , it causes the smallest change in the waveform since it corresponds to an extremum of the function [ measured waveform ] vs [ viewing angle ] .",
    "depending on the source position relative to the plane of the instantaneous orientation of the lisa triangle , the median angular localization uncertainty for @xmath104 , in the case @xmath93 and @xmath74 , ranges between 550 , 3060 , 5590 , 95135 , and 170250 at isco , 1 day , 1 week , 1 month , 3 months , and 6 months before isco , respectively .",
    "therefore , during the most relevant last week , the area of the sky - position error ellipse can vary significantly , by a factor of 4 - 100 , depending on source position .",
    "we find that within the last month , the median errors are roughly rotation ",
    "symmetric around @xmath105 .",
    "randomly in our monte carlo simulation ( see   [ sec : assumptions ] ) .",
    "we also tried fixing @xmath106 at some value and found an approximate rotation symmetry in this case as well .",
    "] therefore , systematic effects become prominent approaching isco because errors improve much more quickly near the lisa plane .",
    "quite remarkably , the errors are small enough very early on everywhere on the sky allowing to decide several months in advance whether the merger will take place in the sensitive region of lisa sky . therefore ,",
    "if several coincident inspiral events are identified during the lisa mission , it will be possible to choose which one(s ) to monitor with electromagnetic instruments according to which event is projected to have the best lisa precision closer to the merger .",
    "( the broader issue of cutting down the number of potential host galaxy counterparts will be discussed in   [ sec : cutting ] below . )",
    "the results summarized above suggest that it will be possible to identify , prior to merger , a small enough region in the sky where any prompt electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart to a lisa inspiral event will be located . given sufficient `` advance notice , '' it",
    "will then be possible to trigger a search for em counterparts as the merger proceeds ( and also during the most energetic coalescence phase ) .",
    "the several square ",
    "degree field will , of course , contain a very large number of sources ( a few @xmath107 galaxies in total , at the limiting optical magnitude of @xmath108 mag that may be relevant ; e.g. @xcite and discussion below ) .",
    "having predictions for the spectrum and time  dependence of a coalescing smbh binary , and therefore knowing what to look for , would obviously greatly help in identifying the counterpart , possibly allowing an identification even post  merger .",
    "such a prediction , however , would require understanding the complex hydrodynamics and radiative properties of circumbinary gas at the relevant small separations of a few to a few thousand schwarzschild radii .",
    "this is a notoriously difficult problem even in the much simpler case of steady accretion onto a single smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the best strategy may be an `` open  minded '' search for any variable signatures prior and during coalescence .    in the first half of this section",
    ", we describe several scenarios in which one may expect an em signal to be associated with the coalescence of a smbh binary ( see also @xcite ) . most of this material in",
    "  [ subsec : expectedvariability ] is a review of existing literature .",
    "however , we also present some original material , such as calculations of the relevant orbital time  scales ( fig .",
    "[ f : torbit ] ) , a rough estimate for the spin magnitude and orientation uncertainties for the binary prior to coalescence ( eq .  [ e : spin ] ) , and we propose that candidates may be selected in advance based on whether or not the binary is expected to experience a large and appropriately directed recoil that would favor bright em emission (   [ sec : transient ] ) .    in most cases ,",
    "reliable assessments of the nature of the potential em counterpart are difficult to obtain .",
    "what is most important for our purposes is that these scenarios make plausibility arguments for coalescing binaries being able to produce detectable variable signals during their last few weeks prior to merger  either with periodic variations during the inspiral phase , or a strong transient signal during the final plunge / ring  down / recoil phases . in the second half of this section , ",
    "[ subsec : variabilitysearch ] , we give quantitative estimates of the capabilities of planned wide ",
    "field instruments to look for such variable signals .",
    "the problem of a smbh binary embedded in an accretion disk has received relatively little attention in the literature .",
    "it shares similarities with that of a planet embedded in the protoplanetary disk of its central star , which has been more extensively studied .",
    "the case of two near - equal mass smbh , embedded in a thin , co  rotating disk , has been studied by a few authors .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite indicate that , in this case , a central hole is expected to open in the disk due to tidal effects and the gas surface density within the binary s orbit could be significantly reduced . in the limit of efficient gap clearing ,",
    "no em signal would be expected until after a viscous time ( @xmath109 years ) past merger , when the inner edge of the gas disk falls in and starts accreting onto the black hole remnant , producing an x - ray afterglow @xcite .",
    "however , in a more realistic situation , with no perfect azimuthal symmetry , and especially for unequal masses or thick disks , some gas may still flow across the binary s orbit , and ultimately accrete onto one or both smbhs .",
    "it is not unreasonable to expect that this inflowing gas could produce a bright and variable source , with variability correlated with the orbital period .",
    "indeed , the newtonian potential around the binary will fluctuate periodically , with order unity variations within a radius equal to the binary separation .",

    "likewise , in the planetary context , close pre - main - sequence binary stars are expected to clear central holes in their proto - planetary disks , but @xcite argue that material can flow from the circumbinary disk across the gap to explain the observed 19day variability of the young binary uz tau e.    there are other scenarios that may plausibly produce a variable signature related to the binary orbit .",
    "for example , @xcite examine the case of a highly unequal mass binary , and argue that a significant amount of gas may be driven in by the merger if it is initially present interior to the orbit .",
    "another way to promote variable signatures associated with the influence of the binary s orbital motion is to allow gas to flow in even as gravitational radiation rapidly shrinks the binary s orbit .",
    "this may be possible if the circumbinary disk is geometrically thick ( or advection - dominated ) , with a viscous timescale much shorter than traditional thin accretion disks .",
    "assuming that variability is indeed present , what is the expected period of this variability ?",
    "again , the answer is uncertain , but a reasonable guess is that the variability will be related to half the orbital time ",
    "scale of the binary , corresponding to the periodic quadrupolar perturbation of the gravitational potential .    in figure",
    "[ f : torbit ] we show the time ( @xmath111 ) spent by a binary with a total mass of @xmath112 , redshift @xmath74 , at each orbital period @xmath113 ( in logarithmic bins of @xmath113 ) .",
    "the plots show cases with mass ratios of @xmath114 ( solid ) and @xmath115 ( dashed ) .",
    "the various curves of the same type show the upper and lower bound of the time - evolution depending on the magnitude and orientation of bh spins .",
    "the presence of spin modifies appreciably only the final day of the merger .",
    "quite remarkably , figure  [ f : torbit ] shows that the expected em variability timescale is in a very fortunate range for detection : between several minutes up to 10 hours within the last year of merger .",
    "detecting slower variations would require several exposures over exceedingly long time ",
    "periods , while detecting faster variations ( of the same amplitude ) would require much higher sensitivity per unit exposure time .",
    "if a periodic electromagnetic variation is found within this range , e.g. for an agn in x - rays , it would indicate evidence for an smbh binary approaching coalescence",
    ". the evidence would be especially convincing if this nearly periodic variable `` light  curve '' tracked the known , nearly periodic gw emission , with a significant cross ",
    "correlation between the periods of the two waveforms .",
    "the em lightcurve may perhaps even follow the slow decrease in period , related to the gw chirp , shown in figure  [ f : torbit ] .    on the basis of the relatively well  defined nature of these potential counterparts",
    ", it may even be interesting to carry out , well before the lisa mission becomes operational , systematic searches for such quasi - periodic behavior with the various all sky variability surveys currently being planned .",
    "perhaps the most promising phase for the emergence of bright em counterparts to smbh merger events is , in fact , during or shortly after the violent final coalescence stage .",
    "this is the most energetic phase of the binary s evolution , with typically @xmath116  ergs of gravitational radiation released to the environment in a short @xmath117  s. there are at least two ways to couple this energetic outburst to the immediate gaseous environment of the smbh binary ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a few percent of the binary system s rest mass is lost when the binding energy of the two holes is carried away by gws .",
    "most of this loss occurs during the final cycles of inspiral , the plunge and subsequent ring - down .",
    "gas bound to the smbh s binary would thus experience a sudden reduction in the mass of the central object , on a timescale typically much shorter than the longer ( local ) dynamical timescale on which this gas can respond .",
    "although this sudden disturbance is of moderate amplitude ( @xmath8 a few @xmath41 ) , it is a potential source of transient variability associated with the coalescence , depending on details of the disturbed surrounding gas properties @xcite .    a second , and possibly more direct and promising avenue to couple the energetic gw burst at coalescence to the smbh binary s environment is through the gw recoil / kick experienced by the system .",
    "the accumulation of linear momentum leading to the final recoil builds during the final cycles of inspiral , the plunge and subsequent ring - down , so that it appears as quasi - instantaneous except for any gas that may be located in the immediate vicinity of the coalescing binary .",
    "the magnitude of the kick is determined by the mass ratio , the magnitude of the spins , and the relative orientation of the spin and orbital angular momentum vectors .",
    "the recoil kicks can be calculated accurately using numerical relativity ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "the final bh velocity is found to reach @xmath118 for no spins @xcite , and @xmath119@xmath120 for high spins in special configurations @xcite .",
    "for comparable mass binaries with large spins and arbitrary orientation , a recoil @xmath121 has a @xmath122 probability @xcite .",
    "if the spin axis is aligned with the angular momentum , as maybe the case in gas rich mergers , then the recoil is expected to be @xmath123 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and see   [ sec : cutting ] below ) .",
    "even for a modest recoil velocity of @xmath124 , this amounts to @xmath125  ergs of mechanical energy that can in principle be deposited in the environment as a smbh remnant of @xmath126  m@xmath127 ploughs through .",
    "the em signatures that may emerge from such interactions are difficult to evaluate _ a priori _ since they will depend on many details , such as the properties of the gas that remains bound to the recoiling smbh , the geometry of the recoil system with respect to its environment , and possibly the remnant bh spin .",
    "we will simply note here that these em counterparts are not necessarily bound by the eddington limit traditionally applied to steady systems , if the recoil energy is deposited fast and efficiently enough for the event to adopt an outflowing / explosive character .    for the present discussion",
    ", it is interesting to ask whether the final recoil magnitude and direction can be estimated in advance , and to determine whether it lies in the plane of the binary , where a gaseous disk may be preferentially located .",
    "if so , then this advance knowledge could possibly be used to pick the events that are most likely to produce a transient em counterpart . since",
    "recoil velocities are determined by the mass ratio , spin magnitudes and orientations , the question is whether these parameters can be estimated with sufficient precision in advance . without specific computations",
    ", we can estimate the advance uncertainties for these parameters using simple scaling arguments .",
    "the mass ratio is determined from the 1pn effect , hence it is a `` fast parameter '' that will likely improve quickly with time , close to @xmath71 ( see   [ sec : assumptions ] ) .",
    "spin effects arise at 1.5pn order , implying that the binary spins are also `` fast parameters '' .",
    "the final errors on the spin magnitudes are excellent ( see @xcite ) , better than 1%6%20% for @xmath7435 if @xmath128 .",
    "even the final spin angle uncertainties have not been estimated previously , but we can assume that they are not much worse for large spins than the angular momentum orientation uncertainties @xmath129 , since the two are coupled through precession , and precession was shown to help in reducing the @xmath129 errors . if the spin magnitude is chosen randomly , then the spin orientation measurement error is @xmath130 for @xmath128 at @xmath74 ( r. n. lang , private communication , 2007 ) .",
    "we assume conservatively that the evolution of spin errors scale with @xmath71 until the last day before isco .",
    "according to paper i , @xmath131 . in this case",

    "@xmath136  deg ( @xmath137  deg ) precision can be achieved 10 days before isco , if the final uncertainty at isco is 1.3  deg ( 2.6  deg ) .",
    "this information could thus in principle be used to focus on events with specific magnitudes and/or directions for the expected recoil , in an effort to maximize the likelihood of finding bright em counterparts .        the most obvious observational strategy to catch a prompt em counterpart , especially in the absence of robust theoretical predictions , is to blindly and continuously monitor the source area , through coalescence , for variable sources .",

    "moreover , in the case of alignment , the direction of the recoil kick at merger is in the orbital plane , making the kick  triggered variability discussed in   [ sec : transient ] more plausible .",
    "conversely , misaligned spins may indicate that the merger is dry , and an em signal might not as easily accompany the gw event .",
    "note that a @xmath250 triple alignment between the spins and orbital momentum by chance has a mere @xmath251 probability . in case",
    "there are several coincident inspirals present in the lisa data - stream , a favorable em follow - up candidate could thus be chosen according to a criterion for potential em activity based on the observed relative alignments",
    ".     +    in figure  [ f : orbit ] , we show the accuracy with which we will know the inclination of the smbh orbital angular momentum , in advance of the merger , as specified by the two angles @xmath252 . when considering the individual em candidates in the lisa error volume , one - by - one , the em information allows to set the sky position errors @xmath253 to essentially negligible values .",
    "therefore , it is meaningful to calculate the 2d error ellipsoid for @xmath252 by neglecting correlations with @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "figure  [ f : orbit ] then shows that we will know the inclination remarkably well in advance .",
    "one may therefore envision focusing on galaxy candidates that exhibit inclinations similar to that of the smbh binary .",
    "this will be feasible only if the host galaxy is actually detected and resolved ( i.e. if the smbh binary does not produce near  eddington emission whose psf completely hides the galaxy ) .",
    "the angular size of small elliptical galaxies at @xmath161 with optical magnitudes @xmath108 is expected to be 0.10.5 arcseconds ( see , e.g. , simulations by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can not be resolved from the ground .",
    "however , by @xmath256 , most of the host spheroids may be surrounded by much larger disks .",
    "for example , the 20  kpc diameter disk of a galaxy like our own milky way would extend beyond @xmath257 arcseconds at @xmath161 , and could thus be resolved .",
    "again , one can envision separately monitoring with smaller field  of  view instruments a few of those galaxies ( if any ) whose disks appear to be closely aligned with the orbital plane of the smbh binary .    in conclusion , the alignment of spins ( indicative of the presence of gas ) and the alignment of orbital momentum with the plane of the galaxy can be very helpful in choosing the most likely host galaxy candidates .",
    "note , that a @xmath250 coincidence between the gw and em measured orbital orientation has a @xmath258 probability , thereby allowing a very effective cut to be made on the candidates .",
    "_ galaxy overdensity as indication of enhanced merger rate .",
    "_ another possibility is to focus on galaxy clusters within the few square degrees of interest .",
    "there may be a few to a few tens of known galaxy clusters in this area . combining with the photometric redshift information , @xmath259",
    ", there are on average @xmath260 and 0.01 clusters within this shell , at @xmath74 and 2 , respectively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the probability that a randomly chosen galaxy has undergone a recent merger is significantly larger in a cluster than in the field ; again , it would make sense to separately monitor the dense cluster environments with smaller fov telescopes .",
    "we have argued that real - time triggered searches for em counterparts to smbh binary merger events observed by lisa will be technically feasible , at least for a subset of all such events .",
    "observational strategies to achieve such identifications constitute major astronomical endeavors , however .",
    "it is thus important to clarify the nature of the additional science that could be enabled by real - time identifications .",
    "we describe two important motivations for pre - merger localizations here .",
    "the first motivation is simply coincidence .",
    "post - merger identification of host galaxies will likely rely on active nucleus variability or on a statistical association with rare galactic objects ( e.g. quasars , ulirgs , x - ray or starburst galaxies ; @xcite ) .",
    "depending on the nature of the agn variability or the specific galactic attribute one is willing to associate with a smbh binary merger , possibilities for chance coincidences may remain uncomfortably high .",
    "the combination of space ( sky location ) and time coincidence for a prompt em counterpart that is gravitationally - timed with a smbh merger should considerably reduce the risks of chance coincidences and would thus likely be the most secure way of identifying a truly unique counterpart and host galaxy .",
    "this is particularly important in this context , with observations of a rare transient astrophysical phenomenon that has never been observed before , whether gravitationally or electromagnetically .",
    "secure counterpart identifications are also crucial if one is to perform new fundamental tests of gravitational physics with these events , such as comparisons between electromagnetic and gravitational hubble diagrams @xcite .",
    "the second important motivation is that the detection of prompt electromagnetic counterparts itself may provide additional opportunities for testing gravitational physics on cosmological scales .",
    "we highlight here one such new test , based on the measurement of photon and graviton arrival times from the same cosmological source . as we already emphasized ( see  [ sec : transient ] ) the most violent and energetic phase of the smbh binary merger will be the final coalescence of the two bhs .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that a luminous burst of light is generated at the same time as the most luminous burst of gws is emitted by the coalescing binary system .",
    "if gravitons propagate at a speed lower than that of light , a delay in the arrival time of the burst of gravitons , relative to the burst of photons , may become apparent after propagation over cosmological distances .",
    "one specific scenario in which this is expected is if the graviton possesses a non - zero rest - mass ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that lorentz invariance is satisfied by the massive gravity theory under consideration , we can infer the bound that can be set on the graviton mass , for a given value of the delay between photon and graviton arrival times .",
    "let us write the light travel time to a cosmological standard siren as @xmath85 ( i.e. the conformal time , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the velocity of gravitons as @xmath261 where @xmath262 is the speed of light . by definition , we have @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the delay in graviton arrival times .",
    "the corresponding lorentz factor is @xmath265 so that from @xmath266 , one could deduce the graviton rest mass @xmath267 from the gw frequency , @xmath36 , and any measured delay , @xmath111 . note that , using the conformal time @xmath85 can be expressed with redshift for a given cosmology ( e.g. @xcite ) , and no other cosmological factors enter this calculation .    without any special treatment , it appears unlikely the burst of gws can be isolated and thus accurately timed to better than about a dynamical timescale for the coalescing smbh binary ( i.e. , one final gw cycle ) .",
    "this timing uncertainty will thus set a limit on the minimum graviton rest mass that can be constrained from delays in arrival times . adopting the inverse of the frequency at isco as the limiting timing uncertainty , @xmath268 , for an smbh binary with total mass @xmath180 at @xmath74 , respectively , for which @xmath269  gyr",
    ", we find that bounds on the graviton mass based on arrival time delays are possible as long as @xmath270  ev or in terms of compton wavelength @xmath271  pc , respectively .",
    "this bound on the graviton mass is less stringent , than the @xmath272kpc value derived from the deviations that would emerge in the phasing of massive gw waveforms @xcite .",
    "in addition , any systematic delay in the emission of the burst of photons , which must causally follow the gravitational event and thus the burst of gravitons , could significantly reduce the quality of the constraints on @xmath267 based on differences in arrival times between photons and gravitons .",
    "in fact , in the absence of any quantitative information on such systematic delays at the source , one will be inevitably reduced to model  dependent statements , with specific emission scenarios , unless observations were to reveal an unambiguous propagation effect ( with the burst of photons significantly preceding the burst of gravitons ) .    in principle , however , a possibility exists for more accurate relative timing of the photon and graviton signals . before coalescence , gas present in the near environment of the smbh binary would be gravitationally perturbed in such a way that it could radiate a variable signal with a period closely matching that of the leading - order quadrupolar perturbation induced by the coalescing binary . in this case , independently of the details of the electromagnetic emission process , it may be possible to match the periods of the electromagnetic and gw signals . the offset in phase between the fourier components of the two signals with similar frequencies",
    "could thus be used to effectively calibrate the intrinsic delay in electromagnetic emission at the source . any drift in arrival - time with frequency between the gravitational and electromagnetic chirping signals , as the source spans about a decade in gw frequency during the last 2 weeks before merger ( see fig .",
    "[ f : torbit ] ) , could then be attributed to a fundamental difference in the way photons and gravitons propagate on cosmological distances .",
    "another immediate advantage of this frequency matching is that there is no need to isolate a luminous burst of gws and to associate it with a corresponding burst of photons in the observed signals . instead",
    ", the various phases of late inspiral and coalescence can be tracked via the gw signal , so that the relative timing of the gravitational and electromagnetic signals may be known to within a fraction of the binary s dynamical time .",
    "of course , it is difficult to assess the accuracy of this matching and tracking with frequency without a more detailed analysis .",
    "however , what is clear from our previous discussion is that if the delay in electromagnetic emission at the source can be efficiently calibrated and the absolute timing of both signals can be reduced to less than the binary s orbital period , then the direct comparison of signals could provide constraints on the graviton mass , @xmath267 , of comparable or even better quality than those obtained from the phasing of the gws alone @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the above limits on the value of the graviton mass , @xmath267 , are strongly theory - dependent . in our discussion , as in the analyses of @xcite and @xcite , it was assumed that the finite value of the graviton mass has negligible effects on the rate of decay of the binary or other observable properties of the gw signal ( such as polarization ) .",
    "furthermore , lorentz invariance was explicitly used to relate the delay in arrival times of gravitons to their rest mass , @xmath267 .",
    "these various assumptions can be violated in various theories of modified gravity , whether massive or not .",
    "we will mention a few possibilities of interest here in that they could be phenomenologically tested .    in braneworld models with extra dimensions available to gravity beyond a large , cosmological `` cross - over '' scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from the kaluza - klein mechanism , massless higher - dimensional gravitons may start behaving like 4d - massive particles once they travel distances comparable to the theory cross - over scale .",
    "there would not be any single rest mass associated with 4d - massive gravitons , so that the specific constraints discussed above or in @xcite would not strictly apply .",
    "that is , after cosmological propagation , the relation between arrival time and gw frequency may be more complex than assumed in equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "even though lorentz invariance has been extensively tested for standard model fields , the possibility remains that lorentz symmetry is violated in the gravity sector , especially on cosmological scales .",
    "such apparent gravity sector lorentz violations emerge in braneworld scenarios , if the phenomenology is incorrectly interpreted from a 4d - spacetime point of view ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "independently of higher - dimensional scenarios , specific lorentz - violating theories of gravity in 4d have also been proposed in recent years , e.g. with a vector - tensor character ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this context , it is thus significant that electromagnetic counterparts to smbh binary mergers , together with the opportunity to match and track the gravitational and electromagnetic signals in frequency , may offer unique tests of lorentz violations in the gravity sector",
    ". it may be possible , as the smbh binary decays toward final coalescence , spanning a range of frequencies , to measure the delays in graviton vs photon arrival times as a function of increasing gw frequency , @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the consistency of eq .",
    "( [ eq : delay ] ) with the special relativistic relation @xmath266 could be tested explicitly , potentially revealing empirical violations of lorentz invariance for gravitons propagated over cosmological scales . clearly , to have any chance to perform such new tests of gravitational physics , one will need to identify the electromagnetic counterparts as early as possible .",
    "this may be one of the strongest motivations behind ambitious efforts to localize these rare , transient events well before final coalescence .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the possibility of localizing coalescing smbh binaries in real time , by using the gravitational waves detected by _",
    "lisa _ to trigger searches for electromagnetic counterparts using wide  field instruments .",
    "the idea presented here is that such searches may reveal a time - variable source  showing either quasi  periodic brightness variations during the inspiral stage , or a transient `` burst '' during the coalescence itself  and that this may allow identification of a unique counterpart .",
    "we first analyzed the behavior of the time ",
    "evolving localization error prior to the merger .",
    "as the binary evolves in time , the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath273 , per unit time of the gw detection increases rapidly .",
    "therefore the measurement precision of physical parameters , such as the 3d position , inclination , and spins can improve quickly as the merger approaches .",
    "we have calculated the size and shape of the 3d localization ellipsoid , and its distribution for arbitrary binary orientations and sky positions , as well as how these uncertainty distributions evolve before the merger .",
    "we found that for typical sources at @xmath742 , @xmath136 days before merger , the distance measurement precision reaches its limiting value @xmath274@xmath195 imposed by weak gravitational lensing .",
    "redshift errors subsequently decouple from the sky position errors , and the 3d localization ellipsoid aligns with the line of sight .",
    "the sky position error decreases below @xmath184 , 10 days before merger , for a large range of masses , @xmath275 , at redshifts @xmath276 .",
    "we have also found that the sky position error ellipse is nearly circular after the first few weeks of observation , except for the final @xmath8day before the merger , especially for the small ellipsoids with favorable sky positions and inclinations . during the final day",
    ", the minor axis of the sky ellipse shrinks more quickly , especially for large bh spins @xcite , creating an eccentric sky position error ellipse . finally , we found that the source position can be important : localization improves quickly for sources that lie in the plane defined by the _",
    "lisa _ triangle , but remains much poorer in the perpendicular direction .",
    "we then analyzed the prospects for electromagnetic monitoring of this sky area to look for prompt counterparts and host galaxy candidates .",
    "it will be possible to estimate the time of the merger to better than an hour precision already several months in advance of merger .",
    "the expected number of galaxies that would be present in the gw localization region is up to @xmath72 during the last weeks .",
    "however , we have shown that using photometric redshift information and luminosity cuts consistent with the empirical black hole mass  luminosity measurements , one can decrease the number of galaxy counterpart candidates considerably , down to a number @xmath117@xmath277 approximately 10 days before merger , @xmath278@xmath240 at 1 day , and @xmath167@xmath240 at isco .",
    "these galaxies will be typically very faint , with absolute magnitudes between @xmath279 for @xmath180 .",
    "moreover , the gw localization volume will enclose @xmath248 quasar counterpart candidates at 10 days before merger , decreasing to @xmath167 quasar close to isco .",
    "we find that both the orbital inclination and the spins can be measured with gws to an excellent precision for each counterpart candidate in the field , several months before the merger . using this information , it may be possible to assess , in advance , which smbh binaries will receive a recoil with a direction ( and known magnitude ) that is likely to plunge them into the surrounding gaseous disk , favoring a transient em signal .",
    "if smbh binary orbits align with the plane of the galactic disk , then measuring the disk orientation to @xmath280 would have a potential for further reducing the number of counterpart candidates by typically more than an order of magnitude .    the best hope to find a merger event",
    "em counterpart may be to look for variable emission produced by gas near the bhs .",
    "em variability can be expected if there is ambient gas surrounding the coalescing binary , on the timescale of the periodic gravitational perturbation , @xmath281@xmath83  hr .",
    "an electromagnetic transient might take place shortly after the merger due to gw recoil or the sudden central rest - mass loss .",
    "the resulting counterpart candidates should be monitored for any type of em transients or periodic variability whose period and time dependence is correlated with that of the known gravitational perturbation .",
    "the basic requirements of a wide field of view , and fast detectors , are similar to those of searches being planned for distant cosmological supernovae . for typical lisa sources ,",
    "a triggered em counterpart search campaign will require monitoring a several  square degree area , and could aim for variability at the 2427 mag level in optical bands , corresponding to 1 - 10% of the eddington luminosity for prime _",
    "sources with @xmath1@xmath2 bhs at @xmath3 , on time  scales of minutes to hours .",
    "a cross  correlation of the phase of any variable em signal with the quasi  periodic gravitational waveform over 10 - 1000 cycles may aid the detection .",
    "the optical emission from near the bhs may be obscured by large columns of gas and dust during the merger , in which case monitoring a similar area , to similar flux levels in x  ray , infrared or radio bands may be required .",
    "the real  time monitoring envisioned here could well make the difference between detecting and missing the prompt em counterpart .",
    "our results therefore also constitute a strong scientific case for allowing data from lisa to be optionally downloaded on @xmath8 hourly timescales , to permit near  real  time analysis when a particularly interesting event is noticed .",
    "the secure identification of the em counterpart to a gw event would indeed have far  reaching implications .",
    "the identification of a counterpart would provide observational insights into poorly understood processes related to smbh binary accretion and transients during a general relativistic merger involving the presence of gas .",
    "another tantalizing application of such observations is the possibility to constrain , in new ways , models of gravity on cosmological scales and the geometry of the universe with these events .",
    "comparing arrival times between the em and gw signals may allow stringent bounds to be placed on the mass of the graviton and could enable empirical tests of lorentz violations in the gravity sector .",
