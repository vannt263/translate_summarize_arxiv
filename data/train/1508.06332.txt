    "it was previously missed in searches for nearby low - mass dwarfs due to its low galactic latitude ( @xmath7 ) and small proper motion ( 121.7@xmath10.3  mas  yr@xmath8 ) .",
    "subsequent follow - up observations by @xcite ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b15 ) ; and confirmed the late - type nature and proximity of the source ( 6.0@xmath11.0  pc ) , and have identified it as having an unusually high recessional velocity ( + 83.8  km  s@xmath8 ) , indicative of old disk / thick disk kinematics . @xcite",
    "have deduced that wise  j0720@xmath00846 had one of the closest stellar approaches to the sun inferred to date , passing within 0.25@xmath9  pc over a period of 60,00085,000 years ago , possibly penetrating the outer oort cloud .",
    "evidence for a t - type brown dwarf companion to wise  j0720@xmath00846 was reported by b15 , based on both near - infrared spectral analysis and the presence of a candidate resolved source in high - resolution laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgsao ) imaging . in support of this , i15 reported infrared excess in 11 and 22   photometry from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) that could be attributed to a low - temperature secondary .",
    "however , the detection of the secondary was marginal due to its close separation ( 140  mas ) , large magnitude difference with the primary ( @xmath10 ) , and poor lgsao correction , and neither b15 nor i15 detected significant radial velocity ( rv ) variability over overlapping @xmath113  month timescales . confirming the presence of this putative companion and assessing the degree of its gravitational perturbation on the primary is important for determining an accurate parallax and space motion for wise  j0720@xmath00846 .",
    "this system is only the second ( candidate ) binary to be identified among the 14 known late - m dwarfs within 10  pc of the sun .",
    "another remarkable trait of wise  j0720@xmath00846 reported in b15 and i15 is its weak yet highly variable magnetic emission .",
    "quiescent h@xmath3 emission was observed to be at or below typical values for m9l0 dwarfs , with a relative power of @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath05 .",
    "however , b15 reported the detection of multiple flaring events , both in white - light photometry and h@xmath3 line emission .",
    "these flares were infrequent ( @xmath141% effective duty cycle ) but nevertheless produced order - of - magnitude variations in nonthermal emission .",
    "unfortunately , the x - ray limit of @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath03.2 reported by i15 does not provide a stringent constraint on the high - energy nonthermal emission from this source .",
    "overall , wise  j0720@xmath00846 appears to be similar in magnetic behavior to the rapidly rotating bri  0021 - 0040 @xcite , being weakly active but with occasional strong bursts .",
    "deducing how these bursts relate to age or rotation , or in the case of wise  j0720@xmath00846 interaction with a ( putative ) close companion , may provide critical clues for understanding the overall decline in optical and x - ray magnetic activity across the m dwarf / l dwarf transition and contrary trends in nonthermal radio emission .    in this article , we report new observations of wise  j0720@xmath00846 at optical , near - infrared and radio wavelengths which confirm both the bursting and binary nature of this source . in section  2",
    "we report the detection of low - level quiescent and bursting radio emission based on data obtained with the karl g.  jansky very large array ( hereafter vla ) , and limits on h@xmath3 variability from asynchronous narrow - band photometric monitoring . in section  3",
    "we report new imaging and high resolution spectroscopic observations that confirm the presence of a t5.5 companion , and provide the first indications of orbital motion .",
    "we use these data to make constraints on the orbital configuration of the system in section  4 .",
    "our results are discussed in section  5 .",
    "wise  j0720@xmath00846 was observed with the vla ( project code 14b@xmath0313 , pi burgasser ) in the compact c - configuration ( baselines of 0.035@xmath03.4 km ) on 2014 november 11 from ut 08:48:50 to 14:47:48 .",
    "the widar correlator was set up for c - band continuum observations with two basebands , each having eight 128mhz sub - bands centered at 5.0ghz and 6.0ghz , for a frequency range of 4.488ghz to 6.512ghz and a total bandwidth of @xmath132ghz .",
    "each sub - band had four polarization products ( rr , ll , rl , lr ) and sixty - four 2mhz channels ; a 5sec dump rate was used . after observation of our primary calibration source",
    "3c48 to set the absolute flux scale and measure the complex bandpass , we conducted a sequence of 4min cycles , with 3min on wise  j0720@xmath00846 and 1min on the gain calibrator qsoj0730@xmath01141 .",
    "this observational strategy optimizes image quality by frequent monitoring ( and hence correction ) of phase fluctuations .",
    "all data were reduced with the astronomical image processing software package ( aips ; @xcite ) following best practices for wide - band radio data reduction .",
    "radio - frequency interference ( rfi ) was present throughout the observation , being especially persistent and strong in the sub - bands covering 5.782ghz to 6.512ghz , and also present at varying levels in several other sub - bands .",
    "all data affected by rfi were removed .",
    "in addition , sub - band 0 of each baseband failed to produce robust data , and these measurements were also removed .",
    "after data flagging , our average frequency was 5.27ghz and our total bandwidth was reduced to @xmath131.2ghz .",
    "the final cleaned and calibrated data were analyzed by imaging and performing time - series analysis on the @xmath17-data .",
    "figure [ fig : vla - image ] shows imaging of the entire data set ( all unflagged times and frequencies ) at the coordinates of wise  j0720@xmath00846 , which reveals a weak , elongated source .",
    "this is interpretted to be a blend between weak quiescent emission from wise  j0720@xmath00846 and an unrelated faint background source , each having similar flux densities of @xmath1315@xmath2jy.8@xmath2jy ; the map rms noise level is 2.8@xmath2jybm@xmath8 ] using the aips task dftpl and the procedures described in @xcite , we analyzed the time - series data at the peak flux position , shown in figure  [ fig : vla - series ] .",
    "this series reveals weak but nonzero emission over the entire course of the observation , with a short burst of emission at ut 13:21:37 . masking out the burst",
    ", we measure a mean quiescent flux density of 15@xmath13  @xmath2jy with no evidence of statistically significant variability .",
    "= 296.0 for 295 degrees of freedom , yielding a @xmath19-value of 0.46 . note that with the bursting emission included @xmath20 = 382.5 and @xmath19 @xmath140.1% . ]",
    "this is the weakest quiescent emission detected for a very low mass dwarf to date , comparable to the quasi - quiescent emission reported for the t6.5 dwarf 2mass  j10475385 + 2124234 ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  @xmath2jy ) .",
    "the apparent flux density translates into a specific radio luminosity of @xmath21 = ( 7@xmath12)@xmath2210@xmath23  erg  s@xmath8  hz@xmath8 at the 6.0@xmath11.0  pc distance of wise  j0720@xmath00846 , and @xmath24 = @xmath08.49@xmath10.19 assuming @xmath25 = @xmath03.60@xmath10.05 ( b15 ; i15 ) and @xmath26 = 5.28ghz .",
    "the specific luminosity is 12 orders of magnitude below measurements of previously detected late m and l dwarfs and the relative luminosity falls below the activity - rotation relation of @xcite given this source s @xmath27 = 8.6@xmath10.8  km  s@xmath8 ( section  3.4 ) .",
    "indeed , in terms of rotation and radio power , wise  j0720@xmath00846 is similar to the m7 dwarf vb  8 @xcite and the m8 dwarf denis  j1048 - 3956 @xcite , both nearby late m dwarfs with weak but variable magnetic emission and modest rotation rates .",
    "the weakness of the quiescent emission prevents us from determining either its spectral behavior across the 4.46.5  ghz band or its polarization .",
    "a close - up view of the radio burst around ut 13:21 is shown in figure  [ fig : vla - series ] . the burst appears to have begun during observations of the secondary calibrator , so our data sample it only at or after its peak emission .",
    "reimaging of the radio data in the period around this burst shows it to be associated with a bright point source at the coordinates expected for the brown dwarf ( figure  [ fig : vla - flare - image ] ) .",
    "the burst is highly polarized , with emission in stokes @xmath28 of 175@xmath128  @xmath2jy and stokes @xmath29 of @xmath0150@xmath128  @xmath2jy , implying left - handed circular polarization of 84@xmath30% ( 1@xmath31 equivalent uncertainties ) ; i.e. , consistent with full polarization .",
    "there is no evidence of spectral variation in the burst to within our measurement uncertainties .",
    "we modeled the time series emission as both a rotating spot ( `` pulse '' ) feature with a gaussian profile , and as an exponentially declining flare , @xmath32 after peak emission .",
    "the former yields a peak flux density of 310@xmath140  @xmath2jy , @xmath1320 times greater than the quiescent emission , and consistent with a total emitted energy of ( 1.3@xmath10.4)@xmath2210@xmath33  erg over the 4.56.5  ghz band ( assuming a flat spectrum ) .",
    "the flare model yields a decay time constant of @xmath34 = 3.5@xmath10.9  min and , depending on whether the burst initiated at the start or end of the calibration period , a total emitted energy of ( 13)@xmath2210@xmath33  erg .",
    "the burst emission occurs for at most 3  min during our 5  hr of observation of wise  j0720@xmath00846 , or 1% of the total time on - source .",
    "this is consistent with the flaring duty cycle inferred from the aperiodic white light bursts reported in b15 .",
    "thus , we favor an infrequent flare mechanism for this emission as well .",
    "we nevertheless note that the pulse / spot model implies an emission region @xmath1312@xmath35 in longitudinal extent ( assuming a rotation period of @xmath1314  hr ; see section  4 ) , which is consistent with previous periodic pulse detections @xcite .",
    "longer - term monitoring would be required to distinguish between the flare and pulse hypotheses .",

    "its slow rotation rate and orientation may explain the weaker than average magnetic emission of wise  j0720@xmath00846a , in both optical and radio bands , and its somewhat low flaring rate compared to other late m dwarfs . in addition , with a 12  au semimajor axis , magnetospheric interaction between primary and secondary is unlikely to play a role in driving magnetic emission in either source @xcite .",
    "a more promising role for wise  j0720@xmath00846ab is as a testbed for brown dwarf evolutionary models .",
    "as demonstrated by several studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the inferred masses and atmospheric parameters of several very low mass binaries diverge to varying degrees from evolutionary model predictions . limiting factors for such analyses include lack of knowlege of detailed spectra for individual components , inability to measure component masses , low quality distance determinations , and/or lack of independent age determinations .",
    "while the last factor may be challenging to overcome for wise  j0720@xmath00846ab , the proximity and detection of reflex motion in both astrometric and radial coordinates allows the first three to be addressed , and we anticipate that this system will provide a high - quality test of models in the next 5 - 10 years .",
