    "this observation is in stark contrast with 2hc - tmd , where the frequencies of the lsm ( respectively , lbm ) have been shown to increase ( respectively , decrease ) with increasing @xmath0  @xcite and complicates the identification of the lsm and lbm .",

    "as a result , albeit the modest variations of the high - frequency intralayer raman response@xcite and of the pl spectra  @xcite on @xmath0 may suggest marginal interlayer coupling in rex@xmath1 , our direct investigation of interlayer raman modes establishes that @xmath0-layer rex@xmath1 must be regarded as a van der waals coupled system , with obvious fingerprints of interlayer interactions .",
    "we now propose a simple symmetry analysis to explain why the frequency of the lsm and lbm from a given branch both decrease as @xmath0 augments , in contrast to the case of 2hc - tmd  @xcite .",
    "first , in keeping with recent studies in twisted tmd bilayers and van der waals heterostructures made of 2hc - tmd , we would like to point out that the observation of prominent lsm features in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] suggests that there is a well - defined stacking order in our @xmath0-layer rese@xmath1 and res@xmath1 samples  @xcite .",

    "following the empirical method proposed by chenet _",
    "et al . _ for res@xmath1",
    ", the orientation of the re chains in rese@xmath1 has been preliminarily determined by inspecting the angular dependence of the integrated intensity of the mode v ( @xmath44 ) introduced above  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , allowing us to define the reference angle @xmath45 for a laser polarization parallel to the re chains ( see solid grey lines in fig .  [ fig5]-  [ fig7 ] and supporting information ) . as @xmath43 varies , one clearly observes large , @xmath46-periodic variations of the lsm and lbm integrated intensities ( denoted @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ) , which are direct fingerprints of in - plane anisotropy .",
    "the frequencies and linewidth of the @xmath31 and @xmath37-mode features are found to be independent on @xmath43 .",
    "remarkably , as shown in fig .  [ fig5](c ) , we notice that at @xmath49 , @xmath50 reaches a maximum at @xmath51 and exhibits approximately a @xmath52 dependence , whereas @xmath53 displays a more complex angular dependence with a maximum at @xmath54 and secondary maxima near @xmath55 , close enough to the direction perpendicular to the re chains .",
    "finally , the polar plot of @xmath48 also displays prominent maxima at @xmath56 , as well as secondary transverse maxima at @xmath57 that also match the maxima of @xmath53 .",
    "interestingly , as it has also been reported in few - layer ( @xmath58-thick ) black phosphorus films  @xcite , the observed angular patterns appear to be strongly dependent of the laser photon energy . indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and further outlined in the supporting information , the same measurements performed at a slightly higher photon energy of @xmath7 on the same rese@xmath1 bilayer reveal completely different angular dependencies for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath59 and , importantly , no raman intensity maximum at @xmath45 for any of these modes .",
    "remarkably , we find that the total integrated intensity of the @xmath60 mode ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath59 display similar patterns at both photon energy . remarkably , the modes that exhibit _ two - lobe _ angular patterns at @xmath17 ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath60 mode and mode v ) , exhibit _ four - lobe _ patterns at @xmath7 and _ vice versa _ ( cf . the @xmath20 mode ) .",
    "furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we performed a similar study on a res@xmath1 bilayer with known crystal orientation and found angular patterns for the raman intensities that bear no particular similarity with their counterparts in rese@xmath1 .",
    "the angular patterns of @xmath62 and @xmath63 depend on the incoming photon energy , whereas similar angular patterns are observed for @xmath59 at @xmath17 and @xmath7 , with a maxima in the vicinity of @xmath64 .",
    "one may also notice that @xmath65 still exhibits a maximum near @xmath66 at @xmath17 , but not at @xmath7 , where a maximum is found near @xmath67 .",
    "first , our observations provide useful empirical guidelines to determine the crystal orientation . in practice ,",
    "the re chains are most currently found to coincide with one of the cleaved edges of the @xmath0-layer rex@xmath1 crystals , providing a first hint of the crystal orientation .",
    "then , at @xmath68 , @xmath65 reaches a maximum near @xmath45 both for rese@xmath1 ad res@xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , we should stress that the present experimental results do not make it possible to unambiguously correlate the @xmath69 mode - features with the direction of the in - plane rigid layer displacements with respect to the re chains .",
    "this observation invites further theoretical analysis of the normal displacements associated with the interlayer phonon modes .",
    "second , the diverse angular patterns shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5]-[fig7 ] and in the supporting information shed light on the extremely complex raman response of rex@xmath1 . in order to model the angular patterns described above",
    ", one has to consider the raman tensor in rex@xmath1 ( see ref .   and the supporting information ) . since these materials efficiently absorb visible light  @xcite , the raman tensor elements are complex numbers  @xcite , which are dependent on the incoming laser photon energy . using the general form for a symmetric , second rank tensor , we are able to fit the experimental angular dependence of the raman intensities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]-[fig7 ] and supporting information ) . moreover , our observation of distinct angular patterns on rese@xmath1 and res@xmath1 bilayers at two close - lying photon energies points towards resonance effects .",
    "we note that a recent theoretical study by zhong _",
    "et al . _ predicts a complex manifold of strongly anisotropic excitons in monolayer rese@xmath1 and res@xmath1 , with several associated optical resonances in the spectral window ( 1.96  ev  2.33  ev ) investigated here  @xcite .",
    "a further theoretical analysis of anisotropic exciton - phonon coupling together with an experimental study of the anisotropic dielectric function and resonance raman profile in @xmath0-layer rex@xmath1 is mandatory to rationalize the anomalous photon energy dependence of the anisotropic raman response unveiled in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] .",
    "third , we would like to emphasize that due to the photon energy dependence of the anisotropic raman response in @xmath0-layer rex@xmath1 , great care must be taken while correlating the angular dependence of the raman response of a @xmath0-layer rex@xmath1 sample to its crystal orientation .",
    "in particular , the behavior of @xmath44 shown in fig .  [ fig6](c ) restricts the applicability of the empirical analysis of chenet _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , which remains valid for res@xmath1 at @xmath17 and @xmath7 and for rese@xmath1 at @xmath17 but not at @xmath7 .",
    "we have reported the observation of prominent , interlayer raman modes in distorted octahedral ( 1t ) rese@xmath1 and res@xmath1 .",
    "the splitting of the interlayer shear modes and the strong angular dependence of the raman intensity of the interlayer shear and breathing modes are a direct fingerprint of the pronounced in - plane anisotropy in these materials .",
    "noteworthy , the observation of similar intralayer raman spectra and fan diagrams of the interlayer modes in @xmath0-layer rese@xmath1 and res@xmath1 , suggests that the two materials studied here are ( quasi-)isostructural , bringing a key contribution to a longstanding debate summarized in ref .  .",
    "our findings will be useful to improve our understanding of other anisotropic layered materials such as black phosphorus  @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath0-layer rese@xmath1 and res@xmath1 appear as a stimulating playground for further investigations of symmetry - dependent resonant exciton - phonon coupling  @xcite , whereas from a more applied perspective the anisotropic optical response  @xcite and electron transport properties  @xcite of these systems hold promise for novel optoelectronic devices .",
    "_ note : while finalizing this manuscript and during the review process , we became aware of related raman studies on res@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "although no splitting of the interlayer shear mode is resolved in ref .  , ref .",
    "reports a shear mode splitting of @xmath70 in bilayer res@xmath1 .",
    "the discrepancy between the @xmath71 splittings observed here and ref",
    ".   is likely due to different stacking orders with nearly equal stability , _ i.e. _ , polytypism  @xcite . here",
    ", the stacking order in our @xmath0-layer res@xmath1 crystals would correspond to the type 3 stacking studied in ref .  .",
    "noteworthy , this stacking displays an inversion center for any number of layers . _",
    "@xmath0-layer rex@xmath1 crystals were prepared by mechanical exfoliation of commercially available bulk crystals ( 2d semiconductors ) onto si wafers covered with a 90-nm or 285-nm - thick sio@xmath1 epilayer .",
    "our rex@xmath1 samples remained stable for several months in ambient conditions .",
    "the number of layers was first estimated using optical contrast and atomic force microscopy , and unambiguously confirmed by the present raman study .",
    "micro - raman scattering measurements were carried out in ambient conditions , in a backscattering geometry using a monochromator equipped with a 2400 grooves / mm holographic grating , coupled to a two - dimensional liquid nitrogen cooled charge - coupled device ( ccd ) array .",
    "the samples were excited using a linearly polarized laser at two different photon energies ( @xmath7 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "these energies are significantly above than the band - edge direct excitons that are near 1.3  ev and 1.5  ev in bulk rese@xmath1 and res@xmath1 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "a moderate laser intensity below @xmath72 was used for all measurements .",
    "spectral resolutions of @xmath73 and @xmath74 were obtained at @xmath7 and @xmath17 , respectively . in order to attain the low - frequency range , a combination of one narrow bandpass filter and two narrow notch filters ( optigrate ) was used . after optimization , raman features at frequencies as low as 4.5  @xmath11 could be measured . in order to uncover the anisotropic raman response of rex@xmath1 layers , the samples were rotated with respect to the fixed linear polarization of the incoming laser field . in practice , each sample was mounted onto a rotating stage attached onto a xyz piezo - scanner and placed as close as possible to the rotational axis .",
    "the region of interest was then parked under the fixed , diffraction limited laser spot using the piezo stage .",
    "after each rotation step , the position of region of interest was re - adjusted under the laser spot ( with an accuracy better than 100 nm ) using the piezo - stage .",
    "polarization - dependent raman studies were performed using an analyzer placed before the entrance of our spectrometer , followed by a polarization scrambler in order to avoid any artifacts due to polarization sensitive optics in our spectrometer .",
    "thereafter , we will only consider parallel ( xx ) polarizations of the incoming and raman - scattered photons .",

    "<S> although well - documented in their bulk forms for decades , transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmd )  @xcite have recently attracted considerable attention since the observation of intense photoluminescence ( pl ) from monolayers of molybdenum disulfide ( mos@xmath1 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so far , the majority of works on tmds has focused on trigonal prismatic compounds , with aba / bab stacking ( 2hc phase  @xcite ) such as mos@xmath1 , mose@xmath1 , mote@xmath1 , ws@xmath1 , wse@xmath1  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> however , such developments require unambiguous fingerprints of in - plane anisotropy as well as fast and accurate methods to determine the crystal orientation , the strength of interlayer interactions , and the stacking order . </S>",
    "<S> recently , raman scattering studies of rex@xmath1 have revealed that the raman response of these anisotropic systems depends subtly on the relative orientation of the crystal axis and of the exciting laser field and also on the angle between the polarizations of the incoming and raman scattered photons  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the low - frequency interlayer shear modes ( lsm ) and breathing modes ( lbm ) in tmd make it possible to unambiguously determine the number of layers and evaluate the strength of van der waals interlayer coupling  @xcite . in the case of @xmath0-layer rex@xmath1 , a splitting of the ( in - plane ) lsm </S>",
    "<S> is expected  @xcite and should provide an invaluable tool to investigate in - plane anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> however an experimental observation of this splitting is still lacking .        in this article , we report a detailed raman study of @xmath0-layer rese@xmath1 and res@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we resolve a clear splitting of the ( in - plane ) lsm . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast the ( out - of plane ) lbm do not exhibit any splitting , allowing an unambiguous distinction between lsm and lbm in the raman spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we report the fan diagrams associated with all the raman active lsm and lbm up to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed branches of lsm and lbm are very well described using a simple linear chain model . </S>",
    "<S> noteworthy , in contrast to the case of 2hc - tmd , the frequency of both lbm _ and _ lsm seemingly decrease with increasing @xmath0 and we rationalize this observation using a symmetry argument . </S>",
    "<S> finally , angle - dependent raman studies of the lsm and lbm in bilayer rex@xmath1 recorded at two different laser energies reveal complex patterns which , on the one hand , can empirically be used to identify the crystal orientation but , on the other hand , shed light on the importance of resonance raman effects in these strongly anisotropic layered materials . </S>"
