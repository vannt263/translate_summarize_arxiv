    ", photons can produced pairs of charged particles ( , @xmath5 ww etc . ) and other final states .",
    "physics of elementary particles is studied in collisions of particles of various types : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , , etc ... , which allows to produce new particles , investigate their properties , structure and interaction .",
    "photon collisions are also of great interest .",
    "photons , as electrons , are elementary particles ( that is important for interpretation of results ) , cross sections of new particle production in photon ",
    "photon collisions are of the same order as that in  collisions",
    ". many phenomena of particle physics can be studied in  collision in the best way .",
    "generally speaking , physics in  collisions is complimentary to that studied in other types of collisions . for example ,   annihilation goes via one virtual photon and resonances with odd charged parity ( the same as for photon ) are produced : @xmath9 , z. while in  collisions resonances with even charged parity are produced : @xmath10 h.    since 1970 , two - photon physics has been actively studied at storage rings .",
    "an electromagnetic field of a relativistic charged particle is transverse and can be treated as equivalent photons .",
    "approximately accuracy one can assume that each electron is accompanied by almost real photon with the probability d@xmath11 d@xmath12 d@xmath13 .",
    "these experiments have given a lot of information on the nature of elementary particles .",
    "for example , it was found that some of known c - even mesons have very small cross sections in  collision that indicates that they have not quark - antiquark nature ( as usually ) but more likely they consist of four quark or two gluons .    however , the  luminosity ( number of events / second is proportional to luminosity ) in collisions of virtual photons at storage rings is much lower than  luminosity and concentrated mainly in the region of low invariant masses of  system . in the region",
    "@xmath14 it accounts for only 0.02% of  luminosity .",
    "therefore , it is natural that most of discoveries were done in  collisions .",
    "maximum energy of  storage ring is about 100 gev ( lep - ii at cern with circumference 27 km ) . due to severe synchrotron radiation in storage",
    "rings the energy region beyond lep - ii can be explored only with linear colliders .",
    "such linear colliders of 500 1500 gev center - of - mass energy are developed now in the main high energy centers  @xcite .",
    "some parameters of the linear colliders are presented in table  [ tabl1 ] .",
    "parameters of electron beams here are optimized for  collisions .",
    "the luminosity ( l ) of colliders given in the third line characterizes the rate of events and it is defined as follows : the number of events of a certain class per second @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the cross section of the process . for cylindrical gaussian beams @xmath17 , where n is the number of particles in the beam , @xmath18 are transverse beam sizes , @xmath19 is the collision rate .",
    ".some parameters of 0.5 tev linear colliders , updated in 1996 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     obtaining of such parameters is possible with solid state or free electron lasers ( fel ) . for @xmath20 m",
    "( @xmath21  gev ) fel is the only option seen now .      in the last ten years",
    "the technique of short powerful lasers made an impressive step and has reached petowatt ( @xmath22 ) power levels and few femtosecond durations  @xcite .",
    "obtaining few joule pulses of picosecond duration is not a problem . for photon collider applications the main problem is a high repetition rate",
    "this is connected with overheating of the amplifying media .",
    "the success in obtaining picosecond pulses is connected with a chirped pulse amplification ( cpa ) technique  @xcite .",
    "the principle of cpa is the following . a short",
    ", low energy pulse is generated in an oscillator .",
    "then this pulse is stretched by a factor about @xmath23 in the grating pair which has delay proportional to the frequency . this long nanosecond pulse is amplified and compressed by another grating pair to a pulse with the initial or somewhat longer duration . due to practical absence of non - linear effects for the stretched pulses , the obtained pulses have a very good quality close to the diffraction limit .",
    "one of such lasers  @xcite works now in the e-144 experiment studying nonlinear qed effects in the collision of laser photons and 50 gev electrons .",
    "it has a repetition rate of 0.5 hz , @xmath24 m ( nd : glass ) , 2j flash energy , 2 tw power and 1 ps duration .",
    "this is a top - table laser with flash lamp pumping .",
    "its parameters are very close to our needs , only the repetition rate is too low .",
    "further progress in the repetition rate ( by two orders ) is possible with a diode pumping ( high efficiency semiconductor lasers ) . with diode pumping the efficiency of solid state lasers",
    "reaches a 10% level .",
    "recent studies  @xcite have shown that the combination of cpa , diode pumping , zig - zag slab amplifier , recombining of several lasers ( using polarizers and pockel cells or slightly different wave lengths ) , and other laser techniques ( if necessary ) such as phase - conjugated mirrors , moving amplifiers allows already now to build a solid state laser system for a photon collider .",
    "all necessary technologies are developing actively now for other applications .",
    "free electron lasers ( fel ) are very attractive for gamma - gamma collider .",
    "indeed , fel radiation is tunable and has always minimal ( i.e. diffraction ) dispersion .",
    "the fel radiation is completely polarized : circularly or linearly for the case of helical or planar undulator , respectively .",
    "the problem of synchronization of the laser and electron bunches at the conversion region is solved by means of conventional methods used in accelerator techniques .",
    "a fel amplifier has potential to provide high conversion efficiency of the kinetic energy of an electron beam into coherent radiation , up to 10@xmath25 . at sufficient peak power of the driving electron beam the peak power of the fel radiation",
    "could reach the required tw level .",
    "a short review of activities on fel for photon colliders and references can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the possible layout of optics near the ip is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig21 ]  @xcite .",
    "the conversion region is situated at a distance @xmath26 0.51.5 cm from the ip .",
    "beams collideat the ip at the crab - crossing angle 30 mrad ( see fig .  [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the distance between ip and final quad is about 2 m. all the optics is situated inside a tungsten conical mask which absorbs particle from showers on mirrors and quads .",
    "arguments for chosing this geometry and estimation of mirror resistance are given in ref .",
    "to attain high luminosity , beams in linear colliders should be very tiny . at the interaction point ( ip ) in the current lc designs  @xcite , beams with transverse sizes as low as /@xmath27 200/4 nm are planned .",
    "beams for  collisions should be flat in order to reduce beamstrahlung energy loss ( synchrotron radiation in the field of the opposing beam ) . for  collision ,",
    "the beamstrahlung radiation is absent and beams with smaller  can be used to obtain higher luminosity .",
    "the transverse beam sizes are determined by the emittances , and .",
    "the beam sizes at the interaction point ( ip ) are @xmath28 , where  is the beta function at the ip ( analog of the rayleigh length in optics ) which should be of the order of the electron bunch length . with the increase in the beam energy",
    "the emittance of the bunch decreases : @xmath29 , where @xmath30  is the _",
    "normalized _ emittance .",
    "the beams with a small  are usually prepared in damping rings which naturally produce bunches with @xmath31 .",
    "laser rf photoguns can also produce beams with low emittances .",
    "however , for linear colliders it is desirable to have smaller emittances .",
    "recently  @xcite , a new method was considered  laser cooling of electron beams  which allows , in principle , to obtain the electron beam with cross sections by about two orders smaller than attainable with other methods .",
    "the idea of laser cooling of electron beams is very simple . during a collision with optical laser photons ( in the case of strong field it is more appropriate to consider the interaction of an electron with an electromagnetic wave ) the transverse distribution of electrons ( @xmath32 ) remains almost the same .",
    "also , the angular spread ( @xmath33 ) is almost constant , because for photon energies ( a few ev ) much lower than the electron beam energy ( several gev ) the scattered photons follow the initial electron trajectory with a small additional spread .",
    "so , the emittance @xmath34 remains almost unchanged . at the same time , the electron energy decreases from @xmath35 down to @xmath36 .",
    "this means that the transverse normalized emittances have decreased : @xmath37 .",
    "one can reaccelerate the electron beam up to the initial energy and repeat the procedure . then after n stages of cooling @xmath38 ( if  is far from its limit ) .",
    "some possible sets of parameters for the laser cooling are : @xmath39 gev , @xmath40 mm , @xmath41 , flash energy @xmath42 j. the final electron bunch will have an energy of 0.45  with an energy spread @xmath43 , the normalized emittances ,  are reduced by a factor 10 .",
    "a two stage system with the same parameters gives 100 times reduction of emittances .",
    "the limit on the final emittance is @xmath44 m  rad . for comparison , in the tesla ( nlc ) project the damping rings have @xmath45 m  rad , @xmath46 m  rad .",
    "the electron beam after laser cooling accelerated to one tev energy can be focused to a spot with about 0.5 nm diameter .    for obtaining ultimate emittances the parameter @xmath47 in the cooling region",
    "should be less than one ( compton scattering )  @xcite .",
    "this is also necessary for preserving the electron polarization .",
    "these conditions can be achieved using the method of laser focus stretching described in sect.2 .",
    "laser cooling requires a laser system even more powerful than that for e @xmath48 conversion .",
    "however , all the requirements are reasonable taking into account fast progress of laser technique and time plans of linear colliders .",
    "a multiple use of the laser bunch can reduce considerably an average laser power .    using laser cooling",
    "one can attain in  collisions the luminosity by one order higher than that in collisions  @xcite . besides , the typical cross section in the  collisions are larger by a factor of five . both these facts are very good arguments in favor of photon colliders .",
    "cross sections of `` interesting '' physical processes ( such as charged pair production ) decrease usually with energy as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the center - of - mass energy of colliding particles , therefore the luminosity of colliders should grow proportionally to @xmath51 . a reasonable scaling for the required  luminosity at  collider is @xmath52 where @xmath50 is in tev unit . in  collisions characteristic cross sections",
    "are somewhat smaller and a required luminosity is larger by a factor of 5 .    in linear colliders ,",
    "each bunch is used only once , its production and acceleration requires a certain power .",
    "it means that the number of accelerated particle can not be increased with energy . in current projects",
    "a power consumption is already 100200 mw . the only way to increase the luminosity is a decrease in transverse beam sizes at the interaction point .    in  collision ,",
    "the minimum beam sizes are determined by strong radiation of particles in the field of the opposing beam ( beamstrahlung ) and beam  beam instability .",
    "these effects impose strong restrictions on beam parameters and determine the attainable luminosity in  collisions . in table 1",
    "one can see that all projects use the flat beams , vertical size is of the order of 320 nm and horizontal size is larger by a factor of 100 .",
    "this is because for the same beam cross section the electromagnetic field is reverse proportional to the largest transverse size .      at the first sight , in  collisions",
    "both beams are neutral and collision effects should be absent .",
    "it is not a case .",
    "the conversion point is situated very close to the interaction point ( ip ) , and electrons after conversion pass the ip very close to the axis and influence on the oncoming photons and electrons .    what happens with photons ?",
    "first of all , a photon can be converted into  pair in a collision with an individual electron ( bethe - heitler process  incoherent pair creation ) .",
    "the cross section of this process at high energies is about @xmath53@xmath2 .",
    "the characteristic luminosity in one bunch collision is about @xmath54  therefore as much as @xmath23  pairs will be produced per one bunch collisions ( these pairs move in forward direction and do not cause serious background in detector ) .",
    "note , that this process does not destroy the beam containing about @xmath55 photons .",
    "more important for photon colliders is the process of _ coherent pair creation _ ( conversion of a photon into  pair in the collective field of an opposing electron beam )  @xcite .",
    "this process becomes important for the beam fields @xmath56 ( @xmath57 in our problem ) when @xmath58 where @xmath59 g is the critical field , @xmath60 is the classical radius of electron , @xmath61 is the photon energy .",
    "the origin of this condition is the following .",
    "in the rest system of the virtual  pair created by the photon the electrical field of the beam is @xmath62 .",
    "if the energy acquired by @xmath63 and @xmath64 in this field on the compton wave length @xmath65 is larger than @xmath66 then a virtual particle may become a real one . that is a spontaneous pair creation in a strong field . in our problem the field of the opposing beam in the reference system of the oncoming beam can exceed the critical field @xmath67 g. so , the critical field can be exceeded not only in stars but also at high energy linear colliders .",
    "the coherent pair creation can impose restriction on the value of attainable luminosity .",
    "fortunately , at an energy below about one tev ( which is a goal of the next linear colliders ) this effect is considerably suppressed due to repulsion of electron beams during collisions .",
    "even infinitely narrow electron beams after repulsion at the ip create an acceptable field on the axis , which does not cause catastrophic loss of the  luminosity .",
    "some simulation results of the attainable luminosity are shown in fig .",
    "[ sb3]@xcite .",
    "it was assumed that the conversion point is situated as close as possible to the ip at a distance @xmath68 $ ] cm . the second number is equal to the minimum length of the conversion region posed by nonlinear qed effects .",
    "the vertical electron beam size was taken smaller than @xmath69 , the horizontal size was varied . the total beam power was kept equal to @xmath70 $ ] mw .    in fig .",
    "[ sb3 ] one can see that , if the collision effects are not important , the luminosity curves follow their natural behavior @xmath71 .",
    "this is valid for all curves at large horizontal beam sizes ( low beam fields ) . at low @xmath72",
    "some curves make zigzag or change slope , this is due to the conversion of photons into  pairs .",
    "these results lead us to following conclusions . for the energies",
    "@xmath73 2 tev , which are in reach of the next generation of linear colliders , the luminosity limit is much higher than that required by our scaling for luminosity given by eq .",
    "the energy limit for photon colliders is about @xmath74 510 tev .      .",
    "it is well known that the region with a strong electromagnetic field can be treated as an anisotropic medium with some refraction index  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the conversion of photons to  pairs ( absorption ) considered in the previous section is the manifestation of the imaginary part of the refraction index .",
    "the values @xmath75 are different for photons with linear polarization parallel ( @xmath76 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath77 ) to the field direction .",
    "similar to the behaviour of optical photons in anisotropic crystals an electromagnetic field in the vacuum can change a photon polarization .",
    "such an effect was considered before for high energy photons traveling in a strong field between crystal planes  @xcite . a similar effect ( but not in constant field )",
    "is possible in the conversion region at photon colliders where the high energy photon polarization can change due to interaction with high density optical photons in the laser focus  @xcite . here",
    "we will consider the new effect at photon colliders  an influence of the field of the opposite electron beam on the polarization of high energy photons .",
    "a detailed consideration of this effect will be published elsewhere  @xcite , here only main results are presented .",
    "the field of a relativistic beam has the electrical ( @xmath78 ) and magnetic ( @xmath79 ) components perpendicular to each other and to the direction of beam motion . for the photon moving oppositely to this beam",
    "the effective field is @xmath80 .",
    "let us denote @xmath76 to be a refraction index for linear polarization of the photon ( electrical field ) parallel to the beam electrical field and @xmath77 for perpendicular orientation .",
    "formula ( rather complicated ) for @xmath81 can be found elsewhere  @xcite",
    ". it can be written in the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the functions of the parameter @xmath85 where @xmath86 g is the critical field .",
    "values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 are plotted in fig .",
    "asymptotic values of @xmath89 are the following @xmath90    at @xmath91 the refraction is determined by the real part of @xmath75 , for larger @xmath92 an imaginary part of @xmath75 connected with absorption of photons is more important .",
    "photons are absorbed due to  pair creation .",
    "the probability of pair creation is connected with @xmath93 .",
    "for a circularly polarized photon the probability of absorption on a collision length approximately equal to r.m.s .",
    "bunch length ( @xmath94 ) is @xmath95    we see that the beam field is an isotropic medium with different refraction indeces for linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "such a medium transforms the circular @xmath96 quanta polarization of into the linear polarization and vice versa .",
    "in addition , due to the difference in the absorption length the total polarization decreases . using eqs .",
    "[ nab],[w ] one can obtain the decrease in circular polarization @xmath97 during the beam collision ( it is assumed that the initial polarization was 100% ) @xmath98 here @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are functions of @xmath92 . by excluding ( numerically ) @xmath92 from eqs .",
    "[ w],[dp ] we can find @xmath102 as a function of @xmath103 for different @xmath104 , it is shown in fig .",
    "[ depol]a . for low @xmath103 and large @xmath104",
    "the depolarization is unacceptably high .",
    "the  pair creation is the only one effect restricting the luminosity . in principle",
    ", it may happen that photons lose their polarization at the luminosity much lower than its limit posed by the pair creation . to check this we plotted in fig .",
    "[ depol]b the values of @xmath92 as a function of the same parameters as those in fig .",
    "[ depol]a . in order to decrease @xmath105 at fixed @xmath103",
    "we have to decrease @xmath104 ( see fig .",
    "[ depol]a ) which can be done , for example , by increasing the horizontal beam size @xmath72 .",
    "this corresponds to some decrease in @xmath92 ( see fig .  [",
    "depol]b ) .",
    "now we can estimate the luminosity loss in this procedure .",
    "the luminosity is @xmath106 .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ depol]b one can find that the retention of depolarization below 1@xmath25 is accompanied by a very small loss of luminosity ( compared to the maximum one ) , it is less than 20@xmath25 in the whole region of parameters .",
    "this is very good .",
    "note , however , that so simple adjustments of polarization loss by varying the horizontal beam size @xmath72 is not always possible . in the case where the initial electron beams are very narrow and",
    "the pair creation is suppressed only due to the beam repulsion ( as it was discussed in the previous section ) we will get some value of @xmath92 which is not controlled by the focusing of the electron beams . if depolarization degree is not acceptable it is necessary to adjust the number of particles in the beam and its length .",
    "so , the analysis of depolarization phenomena at photon colliders connected with the anisotropy of the refraction index in the collision region with a strong electromagnetic field shows that this effect is essential in some cases and should be taken into account . by proper measures one can keep the depolarization below few percents without noticiable loss of the  luminosity",
    "future linear colliders offer unique opportunities to study particle physics in  and  interactions .",
    "such photon colliders at an energy 0.1  1 tev are being developed now in the main high energy centers .",
    "hopefully , in 1520 years this will be one of the main areas of particle physics .",
