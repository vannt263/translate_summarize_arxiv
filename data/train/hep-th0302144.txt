    "two dimensional quantum field theories with supergroup symmetries have played an increasingly important role in our attempts to understand phase transitions in 2d disordered systems - some recent works in this direction are @xcite .",
    "these theories however prove quite difficult to tackle .",
    "attempts at non perturbative approaches using conformal invariance @xcite or exact s matrices @xcite have been popular recently , but so far , very few complete results are available . this paper is the second of a series ( started with @xcite ) on models with orthosymplectic symmetry . our goal is to relate and identify the different pieces of the theoretical puzzle available - sigma models , wess zumino witten ( wzw ) models and gross neveu ( gn ) models , integrable lattice models , and exactly factorized s matrices - and to find out which physical systems they describe , and which peculiarities arise from the existence of supergroup symmetries . in our first paper @xcite , we studied among other things the @xmath1 gross neveu model and the @xmath5 supersphere sigma model .",
    "a physical realization for the latter was identified in @xcite in terms of a lattice loop model with self intersections , based on an earlier work of @xcite .",
    "other such realizations for different models or supergroups have yet to be made . in the case of ordinary algebras",
    ", integrable lattice models do provide such realizations , and are closely related with wzw and gn models based on the corresponding groups @xcite .",
    "this relation is also important , for technical reasons , in the solution of the principal chiral models ( pcm ) @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is an analysis of integrable lattice models based on the @xmath6 superalgebra , and the associated field theories . while the general pattern is not unlike the case of ordinary groups ,",
    "important differences are also encountered .    in section 2 , we show that the continuum limit of the model based on the fundamental representation is not the gn ( or wzw model ) but the supersphere sigma model , generalizing the observation of @xcite .    in section 3 and 4",
    "we show that that , for integer spin , the continuum limit is the @xmath3 wzw model at integer level - in particular , the spin @xmath7 quantum spin chain flows to the @xmath8 level one model .",
    "this provides , to our knowledge , the first physical realization of a super wzw model .",
    "we also find that for odd spin @xmath9 , the continuum limit , like for @xmath10 , is not a wzw model .",
    "attempts are made in section 6 to identify the corresponding field theories , based on the expectation that in these cases , the orthosymplectic symmetry is realized non linearly .    the @xmath3 pcm model is discussed in section 5 , and the @xmath11 models and associated parafermions in section 7 .",
    "our conventions for the @xmath6 algebra @xcite are summarized in the appendix .",
    "we start with the integrable model based on the fundamental representation @xmath12 .",
    "the highest weight vector is denoted by @xmath13 , and we shall treat it as fermionic , so the super dimension of this representation is equal to @xmath14 . '",
    "model , and does not change any of the physical results .",
    "the grading we chose is simply more convenient , as it is well adapted to the structure of the symmetry algebra . ]",
    "the product of two spin @xmath15 representations decomposes into a spin 0 , a spin 1/2 and a spin 1 representation .",
    "their highest weights are respectively bosonic , fermionic , and bosonic .",
    "the graded permutation operator reads @xmath16 and the casimir @xmath17 the hamiltonian of the integrable model is defined on the space @xmath18 as @xcite @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 denotes the projector onto spin @xmath21 in the tensor product of the representations at site @xmath22 , @xmath23 is a normalization constant related with the sound velocity ) is integrable , and corresponds to the anisotropic limit of the integrable @xmath6 vertex model one can deduce from the scattering matrix of @xcite .",
    "the bethe ansatz equations for this model read schematically @xmath24 ( where the @xmath25 s are the roots ) and the energy @xmath26 the sign @xmath27 depends on the boundary conditions for the hamiltonian , and has not , in our opinion , always been correctly interpreted in the literature @xcite .",
    "the point is that a hamiltonian with @xmath6 symmetry will be obtained by having the last term in the sum involve the projectors @xmath28 , and identifying the states in the @xmath29 space with the ones in the first space . in the case of superalgebras ,",
    "this is not exactly the same as having the projectors @xmath30 : the difference involves ` passing generators ' through the @xmath31 first states in the tensor product , and this can of course generate signs .",
    "the hamiltonian with @xmath6 symmetry corresponds to the bethe equations with @xmath32 in ( [ bethe ] ) .",
    "this agrees with the original results in @xcite .",
    "antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions would correspond to @xmath33 instead .",
    "according to martins @xcite , when @xmath32 , the ground state of the @xmath34 coincides with the one of the @xmath35 sector , leading to a degeneracy of 4 for the state @xmath36 .",
    "the central charge read in that sector is @xmath37 . the total partition function ( that is , the trace of @xmath38 , @xmath39 the momentum , and for @xmath32 again ) reads from @xcite @xmath40 this is in agreement with the interpretation of the low energy limit of this lattice model with a symplectic fermion theory , as was proposed in @xcite . in the latter paper , this identification was made by using the fact that the hamiltonian is the anisotropic limit of a vertex model which can be reinterpreted as a loop model , and thus as a model of classical @xmath1 spins in two dimensions , similar to the one used in the analysis of the usual @xmath41 model .",
    "it was then argued that the integrable hamiltonian lies in the broken symmetry goldstone phase , and that the low energy limit is the weak coupling limit of the supersphere sigma model , whose target space is @xmath42 $ ] ( the equivalent of @xmath43 for @xmath44 ) .",
    "recall one can easily parametrize this target space using @xmath45 such that @xmath46 . the sigma model action ( boltzmann weight @xmath47 ) is @xmath48\\label{basicsigma}\\ ] ] with the beta function @xmath49 . at small coupling , the action reduces to the symplectic fermions theory , and the partition function ( [ parfun ] ) coincides with the determinant of the laplacian with periodic boundary conditions in the space direction and antiperiodic boundary conditions in the `` time '' direction ( along which the trace is taken ) . for @xmath50",
    "negative , the model flows to weak coupling in the uv , and is massive in the ir , where symmetry is restored .",
    "the action reads then , in terms of the fermion variables , and after trivial rescalings , @xmath51\\ ] ] notice that the relative normalization of the two terms can be changed at will by changing the normalization of the fermions .",
    "the relative sign can also be changed by switching the fermion labels @xmath52 . however , the sign of the four fermion term can not be changed , and determines whether the model is massive or massless in the ir . for @xmath50",
    "positive , the model flows ( perturbatively ) to weak coupling in the ir .",
    "this is the case of the lattice model introduced in @xcite .",
    "it is possible to generalize the integrable model by introducing heterogeneities in a way well understood for ordinary algebras @xcite . in doing so ,",
    "the source term in the equations ( [ bethe ] ) is replaced by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a parameter measuring heterogeneities , and the energy becomes @xmath55 we will not discuss complete calculations here , but simply derive some essential features of the associated thermodynamics bethe ansatz ( tba ) .",
    "the ground state is made of real particles , and excitations are holes in the ground state .",
    "after introducing the frourier transforms @xmath56 the physical equations read @xmath57 and the energy , up to a constant @xmath58 the interesting way to proceed then is to take the limit @xmath59 , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 the lattice spacing ) , such that @xmath62 finite .",
    "we then take the limit @xmath63 with @xmath64 finite . in that limit ,",
    "excitations at finite rapidity acquire a relativistic dispersion relation , with rapidity @xmath65 .",
    "the scattering of these excitations with themselves corresponds to the @xmath66 matrix element : @xmath67\\label{sigma0elt}\\ ] ] and the latter coincides with @xmath68 , the scattering matrix element of particle 1 with itself in the sigma model ( [ basicsigma ] ) , as discussed in @xcite ( this matrix element is called @xmath69 there ) instead . ] .",
    "in fact , one can check that the thermodynamics of the spin chain , in this limit , coincides with the thermodynamics of the field theory for the supersphere sigma model discussed in @xcite : the introduction of heterogeneities provides thus a regularization of this field theory .    as always - and this can be related @xcite to the nielsen - ninomiya theorem @xcite - the massive degrees of freedom near vanishing bare rapidity in the model with heterogenities are completed by massless degrees of freedom at large bare rapidities ( edges of the brillouin zone ) .",
    "these are the same massless modes that would be present in the homogeneous chain obtained by letting @xmath70 .",
    "the dynamics of these massless modes decouples entirely from the dynamics of the massive ones , and one can identify the associated cft with the weak coupling limit of the supersphere sigma model , that is , the symplectic fermion theory .",
    "it is tempting to carry out the same procedure for the case of higher spin .",
    "unfortunately , not much is known about the higher spin integrable @xmath71 spin chains in explicit form .",
    "it is fair to expect , based on analogies with other cases - in particular the @xmath72 case - that such chains do exist , and are described by changing the source terms and energy terms as @xmath73 where @xmath9 is the higher spin .",
    "the thermodynamics of the massive field theory limit is described by the equations @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the boundary condition @xmath77 must be imposed .",
    "the free energy reads then @xmath78 the thermodynamics of the lattice model is described by similar equations , but different source terms .",
    "it allows one in particular to determine the entropy per site of the chain in the large @xmath79 limit .",
    "one finds that this entropy corresponds , for @xmath9 half integer , to a mix of representations @xmath80 , and for @xmath9 integer , a mix of representations @xmath81 .",
    "the integrable models must therefore involve these mix of representations on every site , and presumably must be considered as having @xmath71 super - yangian symmetry , in analogy with the @xmath72 case @xcite . in particular , the extension of the adjoint by a scalar representation to form an irreducible representation of the yangian is typical .",
    "calculations with a twist angle giving antiperiodic boundary conditions to the kinks shows that the representations with half - integer spin have superdimension @xmath14 , while those with integer spin have superdimension @xmath82 .",
    "some of these results have been obtained independently and using a different approach in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that the central charge of these models is @xmath83 as in the usual @xmath84 case , one can deform the models by considering @xmath85 matrices with @xmath86 symmetry , and one can truncate them in the case @xmath87 a root of unity .",
    "the resulting tba s have the form shown in figure 1 ( with a total number of nodes equal to @xmath31 ) , and central charge @xmath88    most of the following is devoted to understanding the field theories associated with ( [ firstceff ] ) and ( [ secondceff ] ) .",
    "the basic field theory we have introduced so far is the @xmath89 non linear sigma model ( [ basicsigma ] ) .",
    "another type of sigma model plays a major role in the analysis : the @xmath90 wess zumino witten model .",
    "details about @xmath91 and @xmath8 are furnished in the appendix : the bosonic part of @xmath3 is @xmath92 , and the group is compact .",
    "the level @xmath93 is quantized ( for the normalization of @xmath93 , we use the level of the sub @xmath92 , like for instance in the works @xcite .",
    "the same model would be called the @xmath94 model following the conventions used in the literature on disordered systems ( see eg @xcite , as well as in our previous paper ) .",
    "the model is not expected to be a unitary conformal field theory : this is clear at the level of the action , where for instance the purely fermionic part is closely related to the @xmath95 system , a non unitary theory .",
    "this is also expected on general grounds , since , for instance , there is no way to define a metric without negative norm ( square ) states in some representations .",
    "it turns out however that the @xmath90 wzw theories are relatively simple , at least at first sight .",
    "the best way to understand them is to use a remarkable embedding discovered by fan and yu @xcite .",
    "these authors made the crucial observation that @xmath97 where the branching functions of the latter part define a virasoro minimal model , with @xmath98 only for @xmath93 an integer does the action of the wess zumino model make sense , and we will restrict ourselves to this case in the following . the virasoro models which appear there have @xmath99 ; they are non unitary , and their effective central charge is @xmath100 .",
    "these models can thus be considered as @xmath101 coset models !    the perturbation of these models by the operator @xmath102 ( here , the labels refer to the description as a virasoro minimal model ) with dimension @xmath103 is well known to be integrable ( the @xmath7 comes from the @xmath91 , the @xmath104 from the @xmath92 ) .",
    "the tba has the form shown in figure 2 @xcite . as observed in @xcite",
    ", it can be obtained after a q - deformation and a truncation of the basic supersphere sigma model tba .",
    "the corresponding s matrices can thus easily be deduced , and follow rsos restrictions of the q - deformed @xmath105 s matrices , or , equivalently , q - deformed @xmath106 s matrices .",
    "the simplest and most interesting case corresponds to the model of virasoro minimal series @xmath107 .",
    "its central charge is @xmath108 while @xmath109 .",
    "the tba for a perturbation by the operator @xmath102 of weight @xmath110 is described by the diagram in the figure in the particular case where the number of nodes is two .",
    "the s matrix has been worked out in details in @xcite .    an amusing consequence of this observation is that the supersphere sigma model appears as the limit @xmath111 of a series of coset models .",
    "this is quite similar to the way the ordinary sphere sigma model appears as the limit of a series of parafermion theories @xcite , this time of type @xmath112 .",
    "an important difference between the two cases is that , since the three point function of @xmath102 vanishes , the perturbation of the coset models is independant of the sign of the coupling , and thus always massive .",
    "the situation was different in the case of parafermionic theories @xmath113 , where one sign was massive ( and corresponded , in the limit @xmath111 , to the case @xmath114 ) , but the other was massless @xcite ( and corresponded in the limit @xmath111 , to the case @xmath115 ) .",
    "for the supersphere , there is no theta term , so it is natural that we get only one flow . for @xmath116 , @xmath117 for @xmath118 . ]",
    "an interesting consequence of the embedding is that we can deduce the effective central charge of the @xmath3 wzw model at level @xmath93 .",
    "using that for the virasoro model , @xmath119 , one finds @xmath120 this result will be compatible with all the subsequent analysis , but it is in slight disagreement with @xcite . in the latter papers ,",
    "conjectures are made that the spectrum closes on primary fields of spin @xmath121 with dimension @xmath122 .",
    "if this turned out to be true , the models we identify would not exactly be the wzw models , but maybe some `` extensions '' of these - at the present time , this issue is not settled , but it seems simpler to assume the value ( [ ceff ] ) is indeed the effective central charge of the wzw model .",
    "we consider now tba s with a total number of nodes @xmath124 . if the massive node is the @xmath125 one , the uv central charge is @xmath126 suggesting that the model can be understood as a coset model @xmath127 . assuming the tba corresponds to a theory perturbed by an operator whose odd point functions vanish , we find the dimension of the perturbing operator to be @xmath128 .",
    "this is compatible with taking the spin @xmath15 field in the denominator of the coset .",
    "if the massive node is the @xmath129 one meanwhile , the central charge is @xmath130 suggesting similarly that the model can be understood as a coset @xmath131 perturbed by the operator of dimension @xmath128 . of course the two cases",
    "are actually equivalent by taking mirror images , but it is convenient to keep them separate to study the large @xmath132 limit later .      we now consider instead tba s with a total number of nodes @xmath133 .",
    "if the massive node is the @xmath125 one , the uv central charge is found to be @xmath134 suggesting that the models can be interpreted as coset @xmath135 . assuming the tba corresponds to a theory perturbed by an operator whose odd point functions",
    "do not vanish , we find the dimension of the perturbing operator to be @xmath136 .",
    "this is compatible with taking the spin @xmath15 field in the denominator of the coset .",
    "note that , since we have assumed the three point function of the perturbing operator does not vanish , switching the sign of the perturbation should lead to a different result .",
    "it is natural to expect that one has then a massless flow , whose tba and s matrices are readily built by analogy with the @xmath92 case @xcite : we leave this to the reader as an exercise .",
    "finally , we notice that the @xmath3 coset model with @xmath137 was first identified in the paper @xcite .",
    "the last possible case we can obtain out of this construction corresponds to a tba s with an odd number of nodes ( say , @xmath138 ) , and the mass on an odd node , too .",
    "the effective central charge is @xmath139 .",
    "the models can be considered as virasoro models with @xmath140 , and the tba corresponds to perturbation by the @xmath141 field now , of dimension @xmath142 .",
    "we have not found any convincing way to interpret this in terms of @xmath1 cosets ; maybe it is not possible .",
    "notice that the @xmath143 is a weight for @xmath144 , which , since it appears with a minus sign in @xmath145 , should be in the denominator of the sought after coset .",
    "notice also that , by using the remark at the end of the previous paragraph , we expect flows between the models we have interpreted in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath92 cosets and these unidentified models .",
    "this could be a useful hint .",
    "taking @xmath146 for the class of models where the massive node is an even one , we obtain theories with central charge @xmath147 .",
    "this value coincides with the result obtained in the first section for @xmath148 .",
    "we therefore suggest that the continuum limit of the lattice models with _ integer spin _",
    "@xmath9 are the @xmath149 models .",
    "introducing heterogeneities then gives rise to the current - current perturbation of these models .",
    "the s matrix is the tensor product of the rsos s matrix for the virasoro model @xmath150 perturbed by @xmath102 ( which we saw can be reinterpreted as an @xmath8 rsos matrix ) and the supersphere sigma model s matrix .",
    "these results apply to the ns sector of the model , where the fermionic currents have integer modes , and are periodic .",
    "the ramond sector can be obtained by spectral flow ; one has in particular @xcite @xmath151 while the true central charge seems inaccessible from the tba , one can follow the spectral flow by giving a fugacity to the solitons , as was discussed in our first paper , ie calculating @xmath152 $ ] , where @xmath87 is the topological charge of the solitons , normalized as @xmath153 .",
    "antiperiodic boundary conditions correspond to @xmath154 , and are found to give , using the system of equations ( 38,39 ) of our previous paper @xmath155 in agreement with ( [ spectralflow ] ) .    finally , it is easy to check from the tba that the dimension of the perturbing operator has to be @xmath156 .",
    "this gives strong support to our conjecture .",
    "we stress that , as far as we know , none of the perturbed @xmath90 wzw models can be interpreted as a gross - neveu model .",
    "the @xmath91 gn models correspond to models with , formally , level @xmath157 , and have a different physics , and different scattering matrices , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we will get back to this issue in the conclusion .",
    "if we take the limit @xmath146 for models which have the mass on an odd node , the central charge as well as the interpretation of the coset models are consistent with a theory of the form @xmath158 , of which the supersphere sigma model was just the simplest ( @xmath159 ) version",
    ".    it would be most interesting to find out the action describing these models , but we have not done so for now - we will comment about the problem below .",
    "in the @xmath92 case for instance , the limit @xmath111 of the wzw model with a current current perturbation coincides with the scattering theory for the pcm ( principal chiral model ) model @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that the same thing will hold for the @xmath3 case .",
    "the tba looks as in figure 8 , and the scattering matrix has obviously the form @xmath160 , where @xmath66 is the s matrix for the supersphere sigma model , up to cdd factors we will discuss below    let us study this pcm model more explicitely .",
    "it is convenient to write an element of @xmath3 as @xmath161 with the constraint @xmath162 . in a similar way",
    ", the conjugate of the matrix , @xmath163 , reads @xmath164 the action of the pcm model reads , after a rescaling of the fermions @xmath165 @xmath166 we note that the @xmath3 group manifold can be identified with the supersphere @xmath167@xcite , that is , the space @xmath168 .",
    "the pcm model , however , can not be expected to coincide with the sigma model on @xmath167 : the symmetry groups are different , and so are the invariant actions . for instance , in the pcm model , the group @xmath3 acts by conjugation , leaving the identity invariant . in the vicinity of the identity , under the @xmath169 ,",
    "the fermionic coordinates transform as a doublet , and the bosonic coordinates transform as a triplet . in the sigma model , the coordinates near the origin transform as the fundamental of @xmath170 . under the @xmath171 of the @xmath170 ,",
    "the bosonic coordinates transform as a triplet _ but _ the fermionic coordinates now transform as a singlet ( they form a doublet under a different @xmath172 , which leaves the sphere @xmath173 invariant ) .",
    "the groups acting differently , the invariant actions can be expected to be different .",
    "this is confirmed by explicit calculation .",
    "the supersphere @xmath167 can be parametrized in terms of coordinates @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 . the constraint @xmath177 gives rise to @xmath178 the sigma model action @xmath179 becomes then @xmath180 the two equations ( [ eqi],[eqii ] ) are similar , but exhibit a major difference in the sign of the four fermion term .",
    "the physics of the two models is considerably different . for the supersphere sigma model ,",

    ".    note that fields with weights @xmath218 and @xmath219 can have some common components due to the presence of fields with vanishing weights .",
    "it follows that many of their products do actually vanish , leading to a multiplicity of sixteen for fields @xmath156 , and not @xmath222 , as one could have naively assumed .",
    "an interesting question is now what remains of the @xmath1 symmetry _ right at the weak coupling fixed point _",
    ", that is , in the symplectic fermions theory itself .",
    "there , it turns out that only the sub @xmath172 can be observed , as the bosonic currents @xmath223 are still conserved in the symplectic fermion theory .",
    "this conservation boils down to the equations of motion @xmath224 . if one naively tries to check the conservation of the fermionic currents , it seems one needs @xmath225 , which is manifestly wrong !",
    "so these currents , which are conserved in the sigma model at any non zero coupling , are not strictly speaking conserved right at the weak coupling fixed point .",
    "the explanation of this apparent paradox lies in the role of the coupling constant and how exactly one can obtain the conformal limit .",
    "the best is to take the boltzmann weight as @xmath47 with @xmath66 as above , @xmath226 and put the coupling constant in the radius of the supersphere @xmath227 , which now leads to @xmath228 .",
    "the equations of motion are _ ^  x&=&x + _ ^  _ 1&=&_1 + _ ^  _ 2&=&_2 where @xmath229\\ ] ] leading , as usual , to the conservation of @xmath230 . the conformal symplectic fermion theory is then obtained in the ( singular ) limit @xmath231 , where the field @xmath232 formally becomes a constant , and @xmath233 a triviality . within this limit",
    ", the @xmath1 symmetry is lost , but one gets as its remnant the two fermionic `` currents '' , @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "it is interesting finally to discuss the algebra satisfied by the @xmath172 currents right at the conformal point ( a related calculation has been presented in @xcite , but we do not think its interpretation - based on rescaling the currents- is appropriate ) .",
    "the ope s are rather complicated : j^+(z)j^-(w)&=&141 + 2|z - w|+_2_1(z - w)^2 -18 ( _ 1_2 ) + |z-|wz - w|(_1_2)z - w -12|z - w|_1_2 + & + & 32j^3 + 1 2z - w|z-|z|j^3z - w + j^3(z)j^(w)&= & + j^3(z)j^3(w)&=&181 + 2|z - w|+_2_1(z - w)^2 -116 ( _ 1_2 ) + |z-|wz - w|(_1_2)z - w -14|z - w|_1_2and we see that the notation @xmath236 is abusive : the field has weights @xmath218 but the opes involve @xmath237 terms .",
    "the commutators of charges are only affected by the @xmath238 term , and the @xmath84 relations are recovered not through a rescaling but because of the presence of other non trivial opes between the ` left ' and ` right ' components .",
    "for instance , writing only the relevant term , one has j^+(z)|j^-(w)&=&12(z - w)|j^3 + 1 2(|z-|w)j^3 +     where @xmath239 .",
    "amusingly , the @xmath240 part of the opes corresponds to the normalization @xmath241 , so the uv limit of the sigma model does contain a `` logarithmic @xmath242 '' @xmath84 current algebra .",
    "the evidence from the tba is that the pcm model can give rise to two kinds of models ( more on this in the conclusion ) : either the @xmath2 wzw models like in the usual case , but also the @xmath243 model , which presumably involves some sort of term changing the @xmath92 part of the action into the wzw one with a current current perturbation , but leaving the symplectic fermionic part essentially unaffected .",
    "we do not know how to concretely realize this though .",
    "another interesting aspect stems from the fact that the central charge obtained by giving antiperiodic boundary conditions to the kinks reads , after elementary algebra , @xmath250 this is precisely the central charge of the models @xmath251 , of which the first two have @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "we are thus led to speculate that the @xmath251 models - or rather , their proper ` non minimal ' versions ( studied in @xcite , although we do not necessarily agree with the conclusions there ) , as the minimal models are entirely empty in this case , are models with spontaneously broken @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "it would be very interesting to look further for signs of an @xmath8 structure in these models , and to study their ` logarithmic ' @xmath92 algebra .",
    "note that these models are obtained by hamiltonian reduction of the @xmath244 model . in this reduction @xcite ,",
    "an auxiliary @xmath95 system is introduced to play the role of fadeev - popov ghosts , so these models are indeed naturally related to the product of @xmath244 and @xmath254 as we observed earlier .",
    "instead of factoring out the @xmath92 , one can of course also factor out the @xmath254 and get an @xmath11 sigma model .",
    "this is especially interesting since the standard argument to derive the continuum limit of the @xmath6 spin chains would lead to a sigma model on the manifold parametrizing the coherent states , and this is precisely @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "note however that the manifold @xmath11 is not a symmetric ( super ) space ( this can easily be seen since the ( anti ) commutator of two fermionic generators does not always belong to the lie algebra of @xmath254 ) . as a consequence , sigma models on this",
    "manifold will have more than one coupling constant .",
    "to proceed , a possible strategy is to follow @xcite and consider for a while models @xmath255 , that is graded parafermionic theories .",
    "graded parafermions @xcite theories are constructed in a way similar to the original construction of fateev and zamolodchikov , with the additional ingredient of a @xmath256 grading .",
    "they obey the ope rules @xmath257 their dimensions are @xmath258 , where @xmath32 , @xmath132 half an odd integer , @xmath259 otherwise .",
    "of particular interest is the ope @xmath260\\nonumber\\\\ \\psi_{1}(z)\\psi_{-1}(w)&=&(z - w)^{{2\\over k}-2 } \\left[1+(z - w)^2    o^{(1)}+\\ldots\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the operators @xmath261 have dimension 2 , and must obey @xmath262 , @xmath79 the stress energy tensor . the simplest parafermionic theory for @xmath263 has @xmath264 , and seems to coincide with the model @xmath265 .",
    "can be represented in terms of a free boson , the cosets @xmath266 and @xmath267 are equivalent there . ] for @xmath93 an integer , @xmath132 runs over the set @xmath268 , @xmath269 .",
    "parafermions with integer @xmath132 are bosonic , the others are fermionic . for @xmath263 , @xmath270 , and there is only a pair of parafermionic fields , of weight @xmath271 .",
    "it can be shown that the parafermionic theories just defined coincide with @xmath272 coset theories .",
    "like in the @xmath273 case , the @xmath90 model with a current - current pertubation can be written in terms of the graded parafermions and a free boson @xmath274 .",
    "it is then easy to find an integrable anisotropic deformation @xmath275 ( in the case @xmath263 , the perturbation reads @xmath276 . )",
    "the non local conserved currents @xcite are @xmath277 and @xmath278 ( where @xmath279 denotes the right component of @xmath280 ) . the tba and s matrices are rather obvious",
    ": we take the same left part of the diagram as for the @xmath281 case , but replace the infinite right tail by the ubiquitous , finite and anisotropic part discussed in our first paper . in the isotropic limit @xcite @xmath282 , the rg generates the other terms necessary to make ( [ parafpert ] ) into a whole current current perturbation .    taking the limit @xmath283",
    "would then lead to the tba for the parafermionic theory .",
    "this would require an understanding of the scattering in the attractive regime where bound states exist , but we have not performed the related analysis .",
    "it is possible however to make a simple conjecture based on numerology , and analogies with the @xmath92 case .",
    "consider indeed the tba in figure [ fig8 ]    where the box represents the set of couplings discussed in our first paper @xcite . in the uv ,",
    "the diagram is identical to the one arising in the study of the @xmath105 toda theory .",
    "the central charge is @xmath284 as discussed in @xcite . in the ir ,",
    "the diagram is identical to the ones arising in the @xmath101 coset models , and @xmath285 .",
    "the final central charge is thus @xmath286 , and concides with the effective central charge for @xmath11 parafermions of level @xmath93 .",
    "we conjecture this tba describes the perturbation of these parafermionic theories by the combination of graded parafermions @xmath287 the effective dimension of the perturbation deduced from the tba is @xmath288 , and this coincides with the combination @xmath289 .",
    "note that we have not studied what kind of scattering theory would give rise to the tba in figure [ fig8 ] , and whether it is actually meaningful .",
    "still , taking the limit @xmath111 , we should obtain the tba for something that looks like an @xmath11 sigma model .",
    "notice that the bosonic part of this model is identical with the @xmath113 sigma model , and thus there is the possibility of a topological term .",
    "it is not clear what the low energy limit of the model with topological angle @xmath115 would be .",
    "the results presented here presumably have rather simple generalization to the @xmath290 case , even though details might not be absolutely straightforward to work out - for instance , we do not know of embeddings generalizing the one discussed in the first sections .",
    "the supersphere sigma model for @xmath50 positive in the conventions of section 2 , flows in the ir to weak coupling , at least perturbatively .",
    "it is expected that the phase diagram will exhibit a critical point at some value @xmath291 and that for larger coupling , the theory will be massive .",
    "the critical point presumably coincides with the dilute @xmath292 theory first solved by nienhuis @xcite .",
    "this theory is described by a free boson with a charge at infinity , and is closely related with the minimal model @xmath265 .",
    "in fact the partition function of the dilute @xmath292 model provided one restricts to _ even _ numbers of non contractible loops can be written in the coulomb gas language of di francesco et al . @xcite as @xmath293\\ ] ] and coincides with the partition function of the minimal model . earlier in this paper , we have identified this model with the @xmath294 parafermionic theory .",
    "the full @xmath292 theory , however defined , has a considerably more complex operator content @xcite .",
    "note that antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions , which give an effective central charge equal to @xmath295 in the supersphere sigma model give , in the critical theory , a highly irrational value @xmath296 .",
    "there are no indications that an integrable flow from the critical theory to the low temperature generic theory exists .",
    "an integrable flow is known to exist in the special case where the symmetry is enhanced to @xmath297 . in that case",
    ", the ir theory is the so called dense @xmath292 model , which has @xmath253 , and is closely related with the minimal model @xmath298 .",
    "note that this model is the second model of the unidentified series in section 4 , and bears some formal resemblance to the model @xmath299 .",
