    "our research deals with understanding the emerging behaviors of groups of simple , interacting agents . the motivation for studying",
    "this subject is twofold : first , understanding the mechanisms that govern collective motions of biological organisms in processes like wound healing , cancer growth , flocking and herding , etc .",
    "second , the application of our insights to synthesis of controllers for swarms of autonomous robotic agents to perform surveillance or monitoring in uncertain environments .",
    "swarming behavior is typically modeled for groups of identical agents , under the assumption that sensing and processing times are negligibly small .",
    "we incorporate the real - world complications of ( 1 ) finite sensing / processing time , which appears as a delay in our model of agent motion , and ( 2 ) differences in the dynamical capabilities of swarming agents .",
    "we conduct a theoretical analysis of the collective motions of the swarm .",
    "we show the emergence of large - scale patterns in the swarm motion as a function of the physical parameters or the swarm , as well as segregation of the agents into separate groups where all agents in a given group have identical dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of aggregates , or swarms , of interacting mobile agents form an active area of study for biological , physical , and synthetic systems .",
    "simple rules of interaction between agents can lead to a wide range of complex aggregate behaviors , even in the absence of leader agents and global motion strategy @xcite .",
    "the emergence of rich collective behaviors from simple interactions is , in fact , a wide - spread phenomenon in many application domains . in biology ,",
    "the formation of aggregates is common on a wide range of spatio - temporal scales , for organisms ranging from bacteria to fish to birds and humans @xcite . in robotics , aggregates of locally interacting agents",
    "have been proposed as a means to create scalable sensor arrays for surveillance and exploration @xcite ; and for formation of reconfigurable modal systems , in which a group of simple agents can be used to accomplish a task that would be impossible for any agent individually , as in @xcite .",
    "understanding the dynamical characteristics of swarm behavior is essential for algorithm design and implementation .",
    "there is a wide range of existing works which model the dynamics of swarms on the level of individual agents @xcite , as well as using continuum models @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , under the right conditions , swarms converge to organized steady - state behaviors ; and furthermore , that environmental noise and/or processing delay acting on agent dynamics can lead to formation of new steady - state motions , or phase transitions between between co - existing steady states @xcite .",
    "noise is used to model effects of environmental disturbance and unknown interaction dynamics in robotic systems .",
    "delays are important in biological modeling of population dynamics , blood cell production , and genetic networks @xcite , etc . ; and in mathematical models of robot networks where communication and processing delays must be taken into account @xcite .",
    "most existing works assume that the swarm is made up of agents with identical dynamics .",
    "however , real - world swarms often include agents with varying dynamical properties , which leads to new collective behaviors .",
    "in biological systems , heterogeneity arises quite naturally when , for example , motion or sensing capabilities in an age - structured swarm vary significantly with age .",
    "a more striking example is that of of predator - prey interactions between a herd of prey animals and an individual or small group of predators , where there are distinct time - scale differences in the motion of predator and prey animals @xcite .",
    "another systems where heterogeneity plays a significant role is the segregation of intermingled cell types , as during growth and development of an organism .",
    "it has been shown that segregation can be achieved simply by introducing heterogeneity in intercell adhesion properties @xcite , or by increasing the intercell attraction between self - propelled cells of a single type @xcite .",
    "an approach based on the cell segregation model in @xcite is used in @xcite to design a potential - based controller that achieves segregation in swarms of self - propelled autonomous robots .",
    "heterogeneity also appears in robotic systems when individual robots with disparate capabilities are used together to achieve a common goal , as in @xcite .",
    "certain robots in the swarm may lack capabilities that are costly to implement . stranieri _",
    "et al _ @xcite , for example , show that flocking behavior can be achieved when a fraction of the agents lack the ability to align their velocities with those of their neighbors .",
    "additionally , heterogeneity may arise over time as some agents in the swarm malfunction .",
    "for example , @xcite introduces an observer to judge the overall  health \" of a swarm , as individual agents lose speed from energy dissipation .    in this paper",
    "we carry out a systematic analysis of the motion of a swarm composed of heterogeneous agents , using the methodology outlined in @xcite .",
    "we extend the model in @xcite and analyze the dynamical behaviors of a heterogeneous swarm of delay - coupled agents , where the swarm is divided into two distinct populations with different motion capabilities .",
    "the inspiration for our model comes from the idea of using swarms of autonomous mobile agents as sensor platforms to survey / monitor an area of interest .",
    "such agents may have different dynamical properties if , for example , some agents but not others are equipped with a particular sensor package that interferes with their motion .",
    "the package may be too expensive or otherwise impractical to mount on all swarm agents .",
    "overall , allowing for heterogeneity in dynamical behaviors of swarm agents gives greater flexibility in system design , and is therefore desirable not only from a theoretical but also from a practical point of view .",
    "the research presented here gives a general approach of modeling and analysis that can be used to understand the effects of individual agent dynamics on the collective motion of swarms .",
    "we know that swarms of self - propelled delay - coupled agents exhibit self - ordering and pattern formation , and that the collective patterns formed depend on the model parameters @xcite ; furthermore , we observe in simulation that heterogeneity in the swarm composition leads to segregation of the individual swarm populations",
    ". we will show how collective motion patterns ( translation , ring formation , and rotation about a common center of mass ) and segregation of individual populations emerge in a basic but general swarming model .",
    "consider a swarm of delay - coupled self - propelled agents , or robots , comprised of two distinct populations ( 1 and 2 ) , following a single motion strategy , but with heterogeneous dynamics .",
    "the agents in population 2 are less  maneuverable \" in the sense that they are not able to accelerate as rapidly as those in population 1 .",
    "this setup models co - deployment of small , fast agents , and larger , slower agents in a given area .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be the inverse mass of agents in populations 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "we scale units so that @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 denote the position of the @xmath5 agent in population @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) ; let @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the number of agents in populations 1 and 2 , respectively ; and let @xmath10 be the total number of agents in the swarm .",
    "the agents have self - propulsion and are globally attracted to each other in a symmetric fashion , with coupling coefficient @xmath11 , however , there is a delay @xmath12 in sensing of agent positions . for notational convenience , we introduce the following notation : let @xmath2 and @xmath13",
    ". the motion of the agents is governed by the following set of delay differential equations ( dots denote differentiation with respect to time ) :    @xmath14    the first term in the above equations represents the self - propulsion of swarm agents , while the second models pairwise attraction between all agents in the swarm .",
    "this simplified model does not include short - range repulsion or other collision - avoidance strategies ; however , earlier studies with homogeneous swarms indicate that the collective dynamics of the swarm are not significantly altered by the introduction of short - range repulsion terms .",
    "the goal is now to characterize the steady - state motions of this system .",
    "following the approach in @xcite , we begin by considering the dynamics in the limit where the number of agents goes to infinity .",
    "since basic collective swarm motions .",
    "as observed in simulation , consist of translation and rotation , the steady - state motions of the centers of mass of the individual populations are a means to characterize the motion of the overall group .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the position of the centers of mass of populations 1 and 2 , respectively : @xmath17 as in @xcite , we assume that the deviations of the robots from the centers of mass of their respective populations are small . we analyze the steady - state motions of the swarm in the limit as @xmath18 for @xmath7 .",
    "the positions of the agents in each population can be written relative to the respective center of mass as @xmath19 note that @xmath20 for convenience , we introduce the notation @xmath21 substituting ( [ eq : chcord ] ) into ( [ eq:2swarmeom ] ) and simplifying the resulting expression using ( [ eq : sumdeltaszero ] ) allows us to write the equations of motion in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 : @xmath24 summing the equations for @xmath25 over @xmath26 , and dividing through by @xmath27 , we get the equation of motion for the centers of mass of population @xmath6 : @xmath28 \\delta r^k_i(t ) \\bigg ) \\\\ & \\quad -\\frac{a \\kappa_k}{n } \\big((n-1 ) r^k(t ) \\\\ & \\quad - ( n_k-1)r^k(t-\\tau ) - n_{\\bar k } r^{\\bar k}(t-\\tau)\\big ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 denotes the dot product in @xmath30 .",
    "we now take the limit @xmath31 , while keeping the fraction of agents in population 1 , @xmath32 constant . under the assumption of small deviations of the agents from the centers of mass of the respective populations , terms in @xmath25",
    "can be neglected .",

    "the system exhibits a number of hopf bifurcations for different values of the parameters @xmath11 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath12 . to find the locations of these bifurcation points ,",
    "consider the linearization of the dynamics ( [ eq : comnonlin ] ) about the stationary solution ( without loss of generality , we choose @xmath46 ) .",

    "in this paper we have analyzed the collective motions of a swarm of delay - coupled heterogeneous agents .",
    "the swarm motions are characterized by the emergence of large - scale patterns ( translation , ring formation , and rotation ) , and the automatic segregation of populations of agents with different dynamical properties .",
    "separation of the swarm into distinct populations is a direct consequence of swarm heterogeneity , and is not observed under homogeneous swarm dynamics .",
    "the patterns observed in simulation were shown to arise in the motions of the swarm center of mass , in the limit as the number of agents in each population goes to infinity .",
    "we derive expressions for the speed of the swarm in the translating state as a function of time delay and coupling coefficient ; for the radii and angular velocities of both agent populations in the ring and rotating states ; and for the fixed phase offset between populations in the rotating state .",

    "it is remarkable that our model reduction , which starts with @xmath100 second - order delay - differential equations and yields one equation of the same type , is able to quantitatively capture so many aspects of the full swarm dynamics .",
    "a real - world model of swarming physical agents must incorporate a collision - avoidance strategy .",
    "this could be implemented , for example , by adding a short - range repulsion to the agent dynamics .",
    "such interactions may affect the collective motion of the swarm to some degree , but our preliminary simulations of homogeneous swarms indicates that the qualitative behavior of the swarm is not affected by short - range repulsion forces .",
    "this will be addressed more carefully in a future paper .    in our model , we have assumed that the motion of each agent in the swarm depends on the positions of all other agents . in future work",
    ", we will relax this assumption to model the effects of non - global coupling on the collective swarm motion ; we will also add noise to the swarm dynamics .",
    "we know that adding noise causes switching between co - existing stable states ( ring and rotating state ) in homogeneous swarms @xcite .",
    "we will investigate how switching behavior changes when the swarm is made up of heterogeneous agents .",
    "our work presents new insights into the collective motions of aggregates of heterogenous , self - propelled agents , whether biological or artificial .",
    "our results are important from a practical design standpoint for artificial systems , as when a swarm of robots is used to survey / monitor a given area of interest .",
    "in addition to their relevance in the study of swarming and herding motions in biological systems , our results on heterogeneity play a predictive role where the dynamics of individual agents are to large degree beyond our control .",

    ", we must therefore re - introduce the full swarm dynamics . for convenience , we express these in polar coordinates , with the origin located at the position of the stationary center of mass , so that @xmath101",
