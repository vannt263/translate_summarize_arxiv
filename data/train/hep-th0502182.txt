    "black holes have attracted renewed interests in the recent developments of string theory and riemannian geometry , such as the ads / cft correspondence @xcite and a certain relation between compact einstein manifolds and black holes @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "these developments motivate us to study the geometry of black holes especially in four- , five- and seven - dimensions among higher dimensional black holes .",
    "this paper is devoted to a first step to investigate the global geometry of five - dimensional kerr black holes constructed by myers and perry @xcite , and hawking et al @xcite . for four - dimensional kerr black holes ,",
    "a valuable textbook @xcite written by b. oneill from mathematical point of view has been published . in the textbook ,",
    "the differential geometry based on special null geodesics ( principal null geodesics ) were fully analyzed .",
    "following the textbook we try to generalize the analysis to five - dimensional black holes . in this paper",
    "we do not stick to mathematical completeness , but develop some key points of the geometry ; integrability of geodesics and curvature property .",
    "these points were studied in the previous works @xcite and @xcite , however , our method is different from them .",
    "in addition , ads black holes have not been discussed in the textbook .",
    "we show that five - dimensional ads kerr black holes are isospectrum deformations of ricci - flat kerr black holes in the sense that the eigenvalues of the weyl curvature are preserved .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we examine the curvature property of five - dimensional black holes .",
    "we show that a linear map on two - forms constructed from riemannian curvature is diagonalizable , and derive the eigenvalues and the degeneracy . in section 3",
    ", we examine the integrability of geodesics based on the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "the section 4 is devoted to the global analysis of five - dimensional kerr black holes . in the last section ,",
    "we generalize the analysis to the case with cosmological constant .",
    "we show the integrability of geodesics and examine the curvature property . in appendix",
    "a , the analysis on the four - dimensional ads kerr black hole is given .",
    "while this paper was in preparation we received @xcite which overlaps with the result on the integrability of geodesics on the five - dimensional ads kerr black hole .",
    "however their result has been obtained using a different approach .",
    "let us write the ricci flat metric for the 5-dimensional kerr black hole @xcite in the boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath2 ; @xmath3 where @xmath4 the non - negative parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to angular momenta and mass , respectively .",
    "the metric @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 with the ranges @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "if we introduce an orthonormal coordinate @xmath12 ; @xmath13 then @xmath14 which represents the standard metric on a three - sphere s@xmath15 . also , the one - forms @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the metric ( [ matric : s3 ] ) are written as @xmath18 and hence these are well - defined as one - forms on s@xmath15 .",
    "thus @xmath19 can be regarded as a metric on the lorentzian space @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the horizon @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 is removed from the space since @xmath24 on @xmath25 .",
    "the equation @xmath23 has two positive real roots @xmath26 , @xmath27 in the region @xmath28 .",
    "we have three open sets i , ii and iii ( called boyer - lindquist blocks ) of m : @xmath29 it should be noticed that three - dimensional submanifolds @xmath30 and @xmath31 are time - like totally geodesic , while two - dimensional submanifold @xmath32 is space - like totally geodesic . this can be seen from calculations of the christoffel symbol ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 run the tangential indices to the submanifolds .",
    "the riemannian curvature @xmath49 may be regarded as a linear map ( curvature transformation ) on two - forms @xmath50 .",
    "then , the matrix @xmath51 is of the form @xmath52 .",
    "explicitly , non - zero components of @xmath53 are given as @xmath54 where @xmath55    we find that the @xmath56 matrix @xmath49 is diagonalizable and the eigenvalues depend on the combination @xmath57 as @xmath58 where the number in the left hand side represents the degeneracy .    the curvature invariants @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) can be simply written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an @xmath63-polynomial with respect to @xmath64 .",
    "for example , we have @xmath65 the invariants are finite for @xmath66",
    ". however , when we extend the square of the radial coordinate @xmath64 to a negative region , a singularity appears at @xmath67 , i.e. @xmath68 .    for the two - dimensional subspace @xmath69 spanned by @xmath70 , the sectional curvature is defined by @xmath71 .",
    "we find from ( [ matrix ] ) and ( [ lambda 1])-([lambda 4 ] ) the following relation between the sectional curvature and the eigenvalue with degeneracy 2 : @xmath72",
    "in this section , we examine geodesics and show the integrability of them .",
    "the integrability of geodesics has been shown in @xcite by using hamilton - jacobi formulation , while we work in the euler - lagrange formulation .",
    "the geodesic equations are given by the euler - lagrange equations . from the metric ( [ metric : g_bh ] ) we obtain a lagrangian @xmath73 where @xmath74 the metric has three killing vector fields @xmath75 , and hence there are three conservations @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in addition , we have a `` total energy '' @xmath79 corresponding to the hamiltonian .",
    "let us write a geodesic as @xmath80 .",
    "then the conservations above are given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 , and @xmath83 represents an inner product with respect to the black hoke metric .",
    "in addition , there exists another conservation generalizing the carter constant in the four - dimensional kerr black hole @xcite .    * *  ( see also @xcite ) +   _ there exists a constant @xmath84 for a geodesic @xmath85 satisfying @xmath86 where @xmath87 the coefficients are explicitly given by @xmath88 _    * *    for simplicity we prove this theorem in a special case ; the totally geodesic submanifold @xmath89 .",
    "the metric restricted to @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations are @xmath92~,\\label{geodesic eqn 1}\\\\ \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(\\rho^2\\frac{d\\theta}{ds}\\right)&= & \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\left(\\frac{\\rho^2}{\\delta_r}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{dr}{ds}\\right)^2 + \\frac{\\partial\\rho^2}{\\partial \\theta}\\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{ds}\\right)^2 \\right]~.\\label{geodesic eqn 2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from ( [ geodesic eqn 2 ] ) , we have @xmath93 by using the conservation @xmath94 the equation ( [ geodesic eqn : proof ] ) can be transformed to @xmath95=0~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which yields @xmath96 where @xmath84 is an integration constant .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath97 the equations ( [ kappa-1 ] ) and ( [ kappa-2 ] ) give the first - order geodesic equations on @xmath90 , which are identical to the theorem specialized to the case @xmath98 with a trivial constant shift of @xmath84 . using similar arguments we can prove the theorem in the general case , although the calculation is complicated .",
    "let us consider special geodesics @xmath100 with constants ( where @xmath101 is an arbitrary constant ) @xmath102 for which @xmath103 and @xmath104  : @xmath105 where @xmath106 for the limit @xmath107 , @xmath108 , which represents an outgoing ( or ingoing , respectively ) null geodesic in the boyer - lindquist block i. the direction of the geodesic @xmath109 coincides with @xmath110 , @xmath111 it should be noticed that the ingoing null geodesic @xmath112 coincides with the kerr - schild null geodesic given in @xcite .",
    "we introduce a new coordinate ( kerr - star coordinate ) defined by @xmath113 together with @xmath114 and @xmath115 , where @xmath116 then , the null geodesics are written as @xmath117 the metric in the kerr - star coordinate is given by @xmath118 where the components @xmath119 and @xmath120 are same form as ones written by the boyer - lindquist coordinate ( see ( [ metric : g_bh ] ) or ( [ metric top])-([metric bottom ] ) ) .    the dangerous term at the horizon , @xmath121 , is absent , and so @xmath19 is extended to the metric @xmath122 on the space @xmath123s@xmath15 ( see figure [ k * ] ) .",
    "the outgoing null geodesic @xmath124 is not defined on @xmath25 .",
    "however , multiplying the factor @xmath125 with the right hand side in ( [ geodesic out ] ) , we have a vector field @xmath126 which is defined on @xmath127 including @xmath25 .",
    "thus , one may understand the outgoing null geodesic @xmath124 as an integral curve of @xmath128 . on the surface @xmath129constant ,",
    "the determinant of @xmath130 is calculated as @xmath131 , so that the restricted metric is degenerate if @xmath23 , i.e. the horizons @xmath132 are null hypersurfaces . at @xmath133 , @xmath128 in ( [ x * ] ) reduces to the killing vector fields @xmath134 the vector fields @xmath135 are tangential to @xmath133 and also perpendicular to @xmath136 .",
    "the integral curves of @xmath135 generate the horizons , which become totally geodesic null hypersurfaces in @xmath127 .",

    "is calculated as @xmath152 then the radial coordinate @xmath153 is given implicitly by @xmath154 where @xmath155 are non - zero analytic functions on @xmath149 .",
