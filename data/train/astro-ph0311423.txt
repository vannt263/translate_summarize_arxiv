    "it has been shown @xcite that nearby galaxy clusters define scaling relations involving their optical luminosity @xmath2 , effective radius @xmath3 and velocity dispersion @xmath4 . reanalyzing the sample of @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath5 for the faber - jackson ( fj ) relation , @xmath6 for the kormendy relation , and @xmath7 for a nearly edge - on view of the fundamental plane , where @xmath2 is in @xmath8 , @xmath4 in 1000 km / s , @xmath3 in mpc@xmath9 .",
    "similar scaling laws are also followed by early - type galaxies , with the only significant difference of the fj relation : in fact , @xmath10 for luminous ellipticals @xcite .    for a sample of 13 massive ( @xmath11 ) dm halos obtained from n - body cosmological simulations @xcite , we have computed the projected radius containing half the total mass ( @xmath12 ) and the mean projected velocity dispersion within it ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "well defined scaling relations relating @xmath12 , @xmath13 and the total mass @xmath14 are found , and are interpreted as the result of the cosmological collapse of density fluctuations and the weak homology of dm halos @xcite .",
    "the slopes of these relations , however , do not coincide with the observed ones : the simplest way to satisfy at once the theoretical and observational scaling laws is to assume that @xmath15 , in good agreement with what inferred observationally @xcite .    ]    since a similar trend of @xmath1 with @xmath2 is also found for early - type galaxies , and the cosmological predictions for the dm halo scaling relations are the same at galactic and cluster scales , the higher slope of the galactic fj relation implies that some additional mechanism played a role in the formation / evolution of ellipticals : indeed , the combined effect of dissipationless merging ( which tends to increase the fj exponent ) and gas dissipation ( which acts in the opposite direction ) might be the solution @xcite .",
    "we conclude that , while the scaling relations of galaxy clusters can be explained by the cosmological collapse of density fluctuations at the appropriate scale , plus a systematic trend the total @xmath1 ratio with cluster luminosity , the scaling laws of elliptical galaxies seem to suggest that additional processes ( like early - time dissipational merging ) probably played an important role after the cosmological collapse of the density fluctuations at these scales . for a discussion of how @xmath1 for clusters could increase with @xmath2 , we refer to @xcite ."

    "<S> by means of high - resolution n - body simulations in a @xmath0cdm cosmology , we verify that scaling relations similar to those observed for nearby galaxy clusters are also defined by their dark matter hosts ; the slopes , however , are not the same . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that the scaling relations of galaxy clusters can be explained as the result of the cosmological collapse of density fluctuations at the appropriate scales , plus a systematic trend of the @xmath1 ratio with cluster mass . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical fact that the exponent of the faber - jackson relation of elliptical galaxies is significantly different ( higher ) than that of clusters , force us to conclude that the galaxy scaling laws might derive from the cosmological collapse of density fluctuations at the epoch when galactic scales became non - linear , plus modifications afterward due to early - time dissipative merging . </S>"
