    "an analysis of the experimental data using the standard model has shown that there is a 95% probability that its mass will not exceed 210  gev @xcite . at the same time , assuming that there are no new fields and interactions and also no landau pole in the solution of the renormalisation group equations for the self - action constant of higgs fields up to the scale @xmath5 , we can show that @xmath6 @xcite , @xcite . in this case ,",

    "the construction of a realistic theory which combines all the fields and interactions is extremely difficult in this case .",
    "unification of the gauge constants occurs naturally on the scale @xmath7 within the supersymmetric generalisation of the standard model , i.e. , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite . in order that all the fundamental fermions acquire mass in the mssm , not one but two higgs doublets @xmath8 and",

    "@xcite bounds on the mass of the higgs boson were compared in the minimal standard and supersymmetric models .",
    "the upper bound on the mass of the light cp  even higgs boson in the mssm increases with increasing @xmath23 and for @xmath24 in realistic supersymmetric models with @xmath25 reaches 125 - 128  gev .    however , a considerable fraction of the solutions of the system of mssm renormalisation group equations is focused near the infrared quasi - fixed point at @xmath26 . in the region of parameter space of interest to us ( @xmath27 ) the yukawa constants of a @xmath28quark ( @xmath29 ) and a @xmath30lepton ( @xmath31 ) are negligible so that an exact analytic solution can be obtained for the one  loop renormalisation group equations @xcite . for the yukawa constants of a @xmath16quark @xmath32 and the gauge constants @xmath33 its solution has the following form : @xmath34^{16/9 } \\left[\\frac{\\tilde{\\alpha}_2(t)}{\\tilde{\\alpha}_2(0)}\\right]^{-3 } \\left[\\frac{\\tilde{\\alpha}_1(t)}{\\tilde{\\alpha}_1(0)}\\right]^{-13/89 } , \\quad f(t)=\\int\\limits_0^t e(t')dt ' , \\label{2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the index @xmath35 has values between 1 and 3 , @xmath36 the variable @xmath16 is determined by a standard method @xmath37 .",

    "these comparatively low values of @xmath23 yield significantly more stringent bounds on the mass of the lightest higgs boson .",
    "the weak dependence of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 on the boundary conditions near the quasi - fixed point means that the upper bound on its mass can be calculated fairly accurately . a theoretical analysis made in @xcite",
    ", @xcite showed that @xmath53 does not exceed @xmath54 .",
    "this bound is 25 - 30  gev below the absolute upper bound in the minimal supersymmetric model . since the lower bound on the mass of the higgs boson from lepii data is 113  gev @xcite , which for the spectrum of heavy supersymmetric particles is the same as the corresponding bound on the mass of the higgs boson in the standard model , a considerable fraction of the solutions which come out to a quasi - fixed point in the mssm , are almost eliminated by existing experimental data .",
    "this provides the stimulus for theoretical analyses of the higgs sector in more complex supersymmetric models .    the simplest expansion of the mssm which can conserve the unification of the gauge constants and raise the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson is the nonminimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite-@xcite . in addition to",
    "the doublets @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the higgs sector of this model contains the additional singlet superfield @xmath55 relative to the gauge @xmath4 interactions .",
    "the most attractive region of the nmssm parameter space from the point of view of theoretical analysis is that corresponding to the limit of strong yukawa coupling when the yukawa constants on the grand unification scale @xmath38 are substantially larger than the gauge constant @xmath56 .",

    "however , the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the nmssm differs substantially from its upper bound @xcite . in this connection",
    ", the present paper examines a very simple model in which @xmath53 reaches its upper theoretical bound for a specific choice of fundamental parameters .",
    "this bound model is obtained by modifying the nonminimal supersymmetric model and yields a self - consistent solution in the strong yukawa coupling regime where , even for comparatively low values of @xmath57 , the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the modified nmssm may reach 125 - 127  gev .",
    "although the parameter space of this model is enlarged considerably , the theory does not lose its predictive capacity .",
    "the proposed model is used to study characteristics of the spectrum of superpartners of observable particles and higgs bosons .",
    "the mass of the lightest higgs boson in this model does not exceed @xmath3 .",
    "this bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson is not the absolute upper bound in supersymmetric models .",
    "for instance , it was shown in @xcite that by introduction four or five additional @xmath58 multiplets of matter , the upper bound on @xmath53 in the nmssm is increased up to 155  gev .",
    "recently the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson has been actively discussed using more complex expansion of mssm @xcite , @xcite . in particular , in addition to the singlet it is also possible to introduce several @xmath59 triplets into the higgs sector of supersymmetric models .",
    "their appearance destroys the unification of the gauge constants at high energies . in order to reconstruct this , in addition to triplets we also need to add several multiplets of matter which carry colour charge in the @xmath60 group but do not participate in @xmath4 interactions , for example four @xmath61 .",
    "a numerical analysis made in @xcite shows that unification of the gauge constants then occurs on the scale @xmath62 and the mass of the lightest higgs boson does not exceed 190  gev .",
    "the existence of a fourth generation of particles in the mssm @xcite , which is extremely problematical from the point of view of the known experimental data , also leads to an appreciable increase in the upper bound on @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , an increase in the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the supersymmetric models is usually accompanied by a substantial increase in the number of particles in the models which may be counted as a serious disadvantage of this type of model . in the present study , unlike those noted above @xcite , @xcite",
    ", we examine the dependence of @xmath53 and the particle spectrum on the fundamental parameters of the modified nmssm in the strong yukawa coupling regime .",
    "by definition the superpotential of the nonminimal supersymmetric model is invariant with respect to the discrete transformations @xmath63 of the @xmath64 group @xcite which means that we can avoid the problem of the @xmath65-term in supergravity models .",
    "@xmath64-symmetry usually occurs in string models in which all the fields of the observable sector remain massless in the exact supersymmetric limit .",
    "in addition to observable superfields @xmath66 , supergravity theories also contain a hidden sector in which local supersymmetry is broken . in modern supergravity theories",
    "this sector includes singlet dilaton @xmath67 and moduli @xmath68 fields with respect to gauge interactions .",
    "these fields always appear in four - dimensional theory and they occur as a result of the compactification of additional dimensions .",
    "the vacuum - averaged dilaton and moduli fields determine the values of the gauge constants on the grand unification scale and also the dimensions and shape of compacted space .",
    "the superpotential in supergravity models is usually represented as an expansion in terms of superfields of the observable sector @xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the superpotential of the hidden sector . in expression (",
    "[ 3 ] ) summation is performed over the recurrent greek subscripts .",
    "the requirements for conservation of @xmath71-parity @xcite and gauge invariance have the result that the single parameter @xmath65 is retained in the mssm which corresponds to the term @xmath72 in the superpotential ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "however , the expansion ( [ 3 ] ) assumes that this fundamental parameter should be of the order of @xmath73 since this scale is the only dimensional parameter characterising the hidden ( gravity ) sector of the theory . in this case , however , the higgs bosons @xmath8 and @xmath9 acquire an enormous mass @xmath74 and no breaking of @xmath4 symmetry occurs . in the nmssm",
    "the term @xmath65 in the superpotential ( [ 3 ] ) is not invariant with respect to discrete transformations of the @xmath64 group and for this reason should be eliminated from the analysis ( @xmath75 ) . as a result of the multiplicative nature of the renormalisation of this parameter , the term @xmath76 remains zero on any scale @xmath77",
    "however , the absence of mixing of the higgs doublets on electroweak scale has the result that @xmath8 acquires no vacuum expectation value as a result of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and @xmath78type quarks and charged leptons remain massless . in order to ensure that all quarks and charged leptons acquire nonzero masses , an additional singlet superfield @xmath55 with respect to gauge @xmath4 transformations",
    "is introduced in the nmssm .",
    "the superpotential of the higgs sector of the nonminimal supersymmetric model @xcite-@xcite has the following form : @xmath79 as a result of the spontaneous breaking of @xmath4 symmetry , the field @xmath55 acquires a vacuum expectation value ( @xmath80 ) and the effective @xmath65-term ( @xmath81 ) is generated .",
    "in addition to the yukawa constants @xmath82 and @xmath83 , and also the standard model constants , the nonminimal supersymmetric model contains a large number of unknown parameters .",
    "these are the so - called soft supersymmetry breaking parameters which are required to obtain an acceptable spectrum of superpartners of observable particles form the phenomenological point of view .",
    "the hypothesis on the universal nature of these constants on the grand unification scale allows us to reduce their number in the nmssm to three : the mass of all the scalar particles @xmath84 , the gaugino mass @xmath85 , and the trilinear interaction constant of the scalar fields @xmath86 . in order to avoid strong violation of cp  parity and also spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry at high energies ( @xmath87 ) as a result of which the scalar superpartners of leptons and quarks would require nonzero vacuum expectation values , the complex phases of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters are assumed to be zero and only positive values of @xmath88 are considered .",
    "naturally universal supersymmetry breaking parameters appear in the minimal supergravity model @xcite and also in various string models @xcite , @xcite . in the low - energy region",
    "the hypothesis of universal fundamental parameters allows to avoid the appearance of neutral currents with flavour changes and can simplify the analysis of the particle spectrum as far as possible .",
    "the fundamental parameters thus determined on the grand unification scale should be considered as boundary conditions for the system of renormalisation group equations which describes the evolution of these constants as far as the electroweak scale or the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "the complete system of the renormalisation group equations of the nonminimal supersymmetric model can be found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these experimental data impose various constraints on the nmssm parameter space which were analysed in @xcite , @xcite .    the introduction of the neutral field @xmath55 in the nmssm potential leads to the appearance of a corresponding @xmath89-term in the interaction potential of the higgs fields . as a consequence , the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson",
    "is increased : @xmath90 the relationship ( [ 5 ] ) was obtained in the tree - level approximation ( @xmath91 ) in @xcite . however",
    ", loop corrections to the effective interaction potential of the higgs fields from the @xmath16quark and its superpartners play a very significant role . in terms of absolute value",
    "their contribution to the upper bound on the mass of the higgs boson remains approximately the same as in the minimal supersymmetric model .",

    "the possibility of a spontaneous loss of cp  parity in the higgs sector of the nmssm was studied in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it follows from condition ( [ 5 ] ) that the upper bound on @xmath53 increases as @xmath82 increases",

    "the case of small @xmath23 is only achieved for fairly high values of the yukawa constant of a @xmath16quark @xmath97 on the electroweak scale ( @xmath98 where @xmath99 ) , and @xmath23 decreases with increasing @xmath100 . however",
    ", an analysis of the renormalisation group equations in the nmssm shows that an increase of the yukawa constants on the electroweak scale is accompanied by an increase of @xmath101 and @xmath102 on the grand unification scale .",
    "it thus becomes obvious that the upper bound on the mass of the lightest higgs boson in the nonminimal supersymmetric model reaches its maximum on the strong yukawa coupling limit , i.e. , when @xmath103 and @xmath104 .    in our previous two studies @xcite ,",
    "@xcite we analysed the renormalisation of the nmssm parameters in the strong yukawa coupling regime .",
    "we showed @xcite that as the values of the yukawa constants on the scale @xmath38 increase , the solutions of the renormalisation group equations on the electroweak scale are pulled towards a quasi - fixed ( hill ) line ( @xmath105 ) or surface ( @xmath106 ) in yukawa constant space , which limit the range of permissible values of @xmath97 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "outside this range in the solutions of the renormalisation group equations for @xmath107 , where @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 , a landau pole appears below the grand unification scale and perturbation theory can not be applied when @xmath111 . along the hill line or surface the values of @xmath107",
    "are distributed nonuniformly . as @xmath112 increases , the region in which the solutions of the renormalisation group equations are concentrated on the electroweak scale in the strong yukawa coupling regime becomes narrower and in the limit @xmath113 all the solutions are focused near the quasi - fixed points .",

    "the yukawa constants approach the quasi - fixed points , corresponding solutions for the trilinear constants @xmath114 and the combinations of scalar particle masses @xmath115 @xmath116 cease to depend on their initial values on the scale @xmath38 .",
    "if the evolution of the gauge and yukawa constants is known , the rest of the renormalisation group equations of the nmssm can be considered as a system of linear equations for the soft symmetry breaking parameters . in order to solve this system of equations",
    "we first need to integrate the equations for the gaugino masses and for the trilinear interaction constants of the scalar fields @xmath114 and then use the results to calculate @xmath117 .",
    "since the system of differential equations for @xmath114 and @xmath117 is linear , under universal boundary conditions we can obtain the dependence of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters on the electroweak scale on @xmath86 , @xmath85 , and @xmath88 @xcite , @xcite : @xmath118 the functions @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 remain unknown since no analytic solution of the complete system of nmssm renormalisation group equations exists .",

    "the weak dependence of @xmath114 and @xmath117 in the strong yukawa coupling regime on the initial conditions has the result that the solutions of the renormalisation group equations for trilinear interaction constants and combinations of scalar particle masses and also the solutions for @xmath107 are focused on the electroweak scale near the quasi - fixed points . in general under nonuniversal boundary conditions",
    "the solutions for @xmath114 and @xmath115 are grouped near certain lines ( @xmath105 ) or planes ( @xmath106 ) in the soft supersymmetry breaking parameter space .",
    "these lines and planes are almost perpendicular to the axes @xmath44 and @xmath130 whereas the planes in the spaces @xmath131 and @xmath132 are also almost parallel to the axes @xmath133 and @xmath134 . along these lines and planes as @xmath112 increases , the trilinear interaction constants and combinations of scalar particle masses go to quasi - fixed points .",

    "fermi degeneracy of the spectrum in supersymmetric theories so that the superpartners of observable particles are substantially heavier than quarks and leptons .",
    "however , it should be noted that a study of the particle spectrum in the nmssm is considerably more complex than a study of this spectrum in the mssm for @xmath26 since two new yukawa constants @xmath82 and @xmath83 appear in the nonminimal supersymmetric model for which the boundary conditions are unknown . in turn , the renormalisation of the trilinear interaction constants and the scalar particle masses , i.e , the values of the functions @xmath125 , @xmath135 , @xmath126 , @xmath136 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , where @xmath137 depends on the choice of @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath138 on the grand unification scale .",
    "the most interesting from the point of view of a theoretical analysis is a study of the spectrum of heavy supersymmetric particles when the scale of the supersymmetry breaking @xmath139 .",

    "as has been noted , the standard model highly accurately describes all the existing experimental data .",
    "additional higgs fields and superpartners of observable particles interacting with vector @xmath140 and @xmath141 bosons make a nonzero contribution to the electroweak observables .",
    "however , for @xmath142 their contribution is suppressed in a power fashion as @xmath143 , where any increase in the scale of the supersymmetry breaking leads to convergence of the theoretical predictions for the strong interaction constant @xmath144 which may be obtained assuming unification of the gauge constants @xcite , with the results of an analysis of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the mass of the lightest higgs boson which is one of the central objects of investigation in any supersymmetric model reaches its highest value for @xmath145 .",
    "unfortunately , in the strong yukawa coupling regime in the nmssm with a minimal set of fundamental parameters it is impossible to obtain a self - consistent solution which on the one hand would lead to a spectrum with heavy superparticles and on the other could give a mass of the lightest higgs boson greater than that in the mssm .",
    "when calculating the particle spectrum , the fundamental parameters @xmath86 , @xmath88 , and @xmath85 on the scale @xmath38 should be selected so that the derivatives of the interaction potential of the scalar potential of the scalar fields @xmath146 with respect to the vacuum expectation values @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath147 would be zero at the minimum : @xmath148 since the trilinear interaction constants and the scalar particle masses in the strong yukawa coupling regime are almost independent of @xmath86 , eqs.([7 ] ) link the vacuum expectation value of the neutral scalar field @xmath149 , and the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath85 .",

    "studies of the particle spectrum in the nonminimal supersymmetric model @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite have shown that a self - consistent nontrivial solution of the system of nonlinear algebraic eqs.([7 ] ) for @xmath153 which determines the position of the minimum of the interaction potential of the scalar fields , only exists for @xmath154 . in this case a strict correlation exists between the fundamental parameters of the nmssm .",
    "in particular , in order to ensure that spontaneous breaking of @xmath4 symmetry occurs and the field @xmath55 has a nonzero vacuum expectation value of the field , the condition @xmath155 must be satisfied . however , the following inequalities must also be satisfied : @xmath156 otherwise , the superpartners of leptons and quarks acquire vacuum expectation values @xcite .",

    ", the absolute value of the mixing between @xmath211 and @xmath212 is greater for @xmath275 .",

    "it can be seen from figs . 2a and 4a",
    "that the mass of the other heavy cp  even higgs boson ( @xmath281 ) is almost independent of @xmath171 since @xmath282 .",

    "odd higgs boson @xmath284 is very low ( see figs .",
    "2a , 4a ) , which leads to the appearance of a constraint on @xmath171 .",
    "nevertheless , with this choice of fundamental parameters this higgs boson is negligibly involved in electromagnetic and weak interactions since the main contribution to its wave function is made by the cp  odd component of the field @xmath55 .",

    "the spectrum of remaining neutralinos , charginos , squarks , and sleptons does not depend on the choice of @xmath171 .",
    "since the dependence of the soft supersymmetry breaking parameters on @xmath86 disappears in the strong yukawa coupling regime on the electroweak scale , the spectrum of superpartners of the observable particles and also @xmath221 and @xmath178 whose numerical values are determined by solving the system of eqs.([12 ] ) , vary weakly when the trilinear interaction constant of the scalar fields varies between @xmath286 and @xmath85 . despite this , the dependence of the higgs boson spectrum on @xmath86 is conserved .",
