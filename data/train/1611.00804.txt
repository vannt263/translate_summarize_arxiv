    "many remaining regions in the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which yield the observed thermal relic density for neutralino dark matter , rely on very specific mechanisms , such as higgs - resonant annihilation in the so - called funnel region , or sfermion co - annihilation . in @xcite",
    "we identified new regions , where the dark matter particle is a mixed  as opposed to pure  wino , has mass in the tev region , and yields the observed relic density .",
    "these new regions are driven to the correct relic abundance by the proximity of the resonance of the sommerfeld effect due to electroweak gauge boson exchange .",
    "in such situations , the annihilation cross section is strongly velocity dependent , and the present - day annihilation cross section is expected to be relatively large , potentially leading to observable signals in indirect searches for dark matter ( dm ) . on the other hand",
    ", a substantial higgsino fraction of a mixed dark matter particle leads to a large , potentially observable dark matter - nucleon scattering cross section .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of which part of this region survives the combination of direct and indirect detection constraints .",
    "for the latter we consider diffuse gamma - rays from the dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) , galactic cosmic rays ( crs ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "these have been found to be the most promising channels for detecting or excluding the pure - wino dm model @xcite .",
    "stronger limits can be obtained only from the non - observation of the gamma - line feature and to a lesser extent from diffuse gamma - rays both originating in the galactic centre ( gc ) .",
    "indeed , it has been shown @xcite that the pure - wino model is ruled out by the absence of an excess in these search channels , unless the galactic dark matter profile develops a core , which remains a possibility .",
    "since the viability of wino - like dm is a question of fundamental importance , we generally adopt the weaker constraint in case of uncertainty , and hence we take the point of view that wino - like dm is presently not excluded by gamma - line and galactic diffuse gamma - ray searches .",
    "future results from the erenkov telescope array ( cta ) are expected to be sensitive enough to resolve this issue ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and will either observe an excess in gamma - rays or exclude the dominantly wino dm mssm parameter region discussed in the present paper .    imposing the observed relic density as a constraint ,",
    "the pure - wino dm model has no free parameters and corresponds to the limit of the mssm when all other superpartner particles and non - standard higgs bosons are decoupled .",
    "departing from the pure wino in the mssm introduces many additional dimensions in the mssm parameter space and changes the present - day annihilation cross section , branching ratios ( brs ) for particular primary final states , and the final gamma and cr spectra leading to a modification of the limits .",
    "the tools for the precise computation of neutralino dark matter ( co- ) annihilation in the generic mssm when the sommerfeld enhancement is operative have been developed in  @xcite and applied to relic density computations in @xcite .",
    "the present analysis is based on an extension of the code to calculate the annihilation cross sections for all exclusive two - body final states separately , rather than the inclusive cross section .",
    "further motivation for the present study is provided by the spectrum of the cosmic antiproton - to - proton ratio reported by the ams-02 collaboration @xcite , which appears to be somewhat harder than expected from the commonly adopted cosmic - ray propagation models . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that pure - wino dm can improve the description of this data .",
    "although our understanding of the background is insufficient to claim the existence of a dark matter signal in antiprotons , it is nevertheless interesting to check whether the surviving mixed - wino dm regions are compatible with antiproton data .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : fluxes ] we summarize the theoretical input , beginning with a description of the dominantly wino mssm parameter region satisfying the relic - density constraint , then providing some details on the computation of the dm annihilation rates to primary two - body final states .",
    "the following section  [ sec : methodology ] supplies information about the implementation of the constraints from diffuse gamma - rays from the dsphs , galactic crs , direct detection and the cmb , and the data employed for the analysis .",
    "the results of the indirect detection analysis are presented in section  [ sec : results ] as constraints in the plane of the two most relevant parameters of the mssm , the wino mass parameter @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the higgsino mass parameter . in section",
    "[ sec : maximalplot ] the indirect detection constraints are combined with that from the non - observation of dark matter - nucleon scattering . for the case of @xmath1",
    "we demonstrate the existence of a mixed wino - higgsino region satisfying all constraints , while for @xmath0 we show that there is essentially no remaining parameter space left . section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes .",
    "in @xcite the sommerfeld corrections to the relic abundance computation for tev - scale neutralino dark matter in the full mssm have been studied . the ability to perform the computations for mixed dark matter at a general mssm parameter space point",
    "@xcite revealed a large neutralino mass range with the correct thermal relic density , which opens mainly due to the proximity of the resonance of the sommerfeld effect and its dependence on mssm parameters . in this subsection",
    "we briefly review the dominantly - wino parameter region identified in @xcite , which will be studied in this paper .",
    "`` dominantly - wino '' or `` wino - like '' here refers to a general mssm with non - decoupled higgs bosons , sfermions , bino and higgsinos as long as the mixed neutralino dark matter state is mainly wino .",
    "we also require that its mass is significantly larger than the electroweak scale .",
    "the well - investigated pure - wino model refers to the limit in this parameter space , when all particles other than the triplet wino are decoupled .    despite the large number of parameters needed to specify a particular mssm completely , in the dominantly - wino region",
    ", the annihilation rates depend strongly only on a subset of parameters .",
    "these are the wino , bino and higgsino mass parameters @xmath11 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 , respectively , which control the neutralino composition and the chargino - neutralino mass difference , and the common sfermion mass parameter @xmath15 . in this work",
    "we assume that the bino is much heavier that the wino , that is , the lightest neutralino is a mixed wino - higgsino .",
    "effectively a value of @xmath16 larger than @xmath11 by a few 100 gev is enough to decouple the bino in the tev region .",
    "the wino mass parameter determines the lightest neutralino ( lsp ) mass , and the difference @xmath17 the wino - higgsino admixture . in the range @xmath18  tev considered here ,",
    "the relation @xmath19 remains accurate to a few gev , when some higgsino fraction is added to the lsp state , and values of @xmath20  gev imply practically decoupled higgsinos .",
    "increasing the higgsino component of the wino - like lsp lowers its coupling to charged gauge bosons , to which wino - like neutralinos annihilate predominantly , and therefore increases the relic density .",
    "larger mixings also imply that the mass difference between the lightest chargino and neutralino increases , which generically reduces the size of the sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation cross section .",
    "these features are apparent in the contours of constant relic density in the @xmath12 vs.  @xmath11 plane for the wino - higgsino case shown in @xcite , which are almost straight for large @xmath12 , but bend to lower values of @xmath21 as @xmath12 is reduced .",
    "a representative case is reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : oldlux ]",
    ". the contours also bend towards lower @xmath11 when sfermions become lighter , as they mediate the t- and u - channel annihilation into sm fermions , which interferes destructively with the s - channel annihilation , effectively lowering the co - annihilation cross section . by choosing small values of @xmath15 ( but larger than @xmath22 to prevent sfermion co - annihilation , not treated by the present version of the code ) , lsp masses as low as @xmath23  tev are seen to give the correct thermal density , to be compared with the pure - wino result , @xmath24  tev .    for @xmath25  tev",
    "a resonance in the sommerfeld - enhanced rates is present , which extends to larger @xmath11 values as the higgsino fraction is increased .",
    "the enhancement of the cross section in the vicinity of the resonance makes the contours of constant relic density cluster around it and develop a peak that shifts @xmath21 to larger values .",
    "in particular , the largest value of @xmath11 , which gives the correct thermal relic density , is close to 3.3  tev , approximately 20% higher than for the pure - wino scenario .",
    "the influence of the less relevant mssm higgs mass parameter @xmath26 is also noticeable when the lsp contains some higgsino admixture , which enhances the couplings to the higgs ( and z ) bosons in s - channel annihilation .",
    "this is more pronounced if @xmath26 is light enough such that final states containing heavy higgs bosons are kinematically accessible .",
    "the corresponding increase in the annihilation cross section results in positive shifts of around 100 to 250  gev in the value of @xmath11 giving the correct relic density on decreasing @xmath26 from 10  tev to 800  gev . in summary ,",
    "a large range of lightest neutralino masses , @xmath27  tev , provides the correct relic density for the mixed wino - higgsino state as a consequence of the sommerfeld corrections .",
    "the mssm parameter points considered in this paper have passed standard collider , flavour and theoretical constraints as discussed in  @xcite . in the dominantly - wino parameter space ,",
    "most of the collider and flavour constraints are either satisfied automatically or receive mssm corrections that are suppressed or lie within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties . ref .",
    "@xcite further required compatibility with direct dark matter detection constraints by imposing that the dm - nucleon spin - independent cross section was less than twice the lux limits reported at the time of publication  @xcite .",
    "this did not affect the results significantly , see fig .",
    "[ fig : oldlux ] , as in most of the parameter space of interest the scattering cross section was predicted to be much above those limits .",
    "recently the lux collaboration has presented a new limit , stronger than the previous one by approximately a factor of four @xcite , potentially imposing more severe constraints on the dominantly - wino neutralino region of the mssm parameter space .",
    "the details of the implementation of the limits from indirect detection searches for the mixed wino , which were not included in our previous analysis , and from the new lux results are given in section  [ sec : methodology ] .     vs.  @xmath28 plane for @xmath0 , as computed in @xcite .",
    "the ( green ) band indicates the region within @xmath29 of the observed dark matter abundance .",
    "parameters are as given in the header , and the trilinear couplings are set to @xmath30  tev for all sfermions except for that of the stop , which is fixed by the higgs mass value .",
    "the black solid line corresponds to the old lux limit  @xcite on the spin - independent dm - nucleon cross section , which excludes the shaded area below this line . relaxing the old lux limit by a factor of two to account for theoretical uncertainties eliminates the direct detection constraint on the shown parameter space region .",
    "[ fig : oldlux ] ]      the annihilation of wino - like dm produces highly energetic particles , which subsequently decay , fragment and hadronize into stable sm particles , producing the cr fluxes .",
    "the primary particles can be any of the sm particles , and the heavy mssm higgs bosons , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , when they are kinematically accessible .",
    "we consider neutralino dark matter annihilation into two primary particles .",
    "the number of such exclusive two - body channels is 31 , and the corresponding neutralino annihilation cross sections are computed including sommerfeld loop corrections to the annihilation amplitude as described in @xcite . as input for this calculation we need to provide the tree - level exclusive annihilation rates of _ all _ neutral neutralino and chargino pairs , since through sommerfeld corrections the initial lsp - lsp state can make transitions to other virtual states with heavier neutralinos or a pair of conjugated charginos , which subsequently annihilate into the primaries .",
    "the neutralino and chargino tree - level annihilation rates in the mssm have been derived analytically in  @xcite , and including @xmath33-corrections in  @xcite , in the form of matrices , where the off - diagonal entries refer to the interference of the short - distance annihilation amplitudes of different neutralino / chargino two - particle states into the same final state . for the present analysis",
    "the annihilation matrices have been generalized to vectors of matrices , such that the components of the vector refer to the 31 exclusive final states .",
    "the large number of different exclusive final states can be implemented without an increase in the cpu time for the computation relative to the inclusive case .",
    "since the information about the exclusive annihilation rates only enters through the ( short - distance ) annihilation matrices , the two - particle wave - functions that account for the ( long - distance ) sommerfeld corrections only need to be computed once . on the contrary , since the @xmath33-corrections to the annihilation of dm in the present universe are very small , they can be neglected , which results in a significant reduction in the time needed to compute the annihilation matrices .-",
    "corrections , we did not make use of this simplification in the present analysis . ]",
    "it further suffices to compute the present - day annihilation cross section for a single dark matter velocity , and we choose @xmath34 .",
    "the reason for this choice is that the sommerfeld effect saturates for very small velocities , and the velocity dependence is negligible for velocities smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "the energy spectrum @xmath36 of a stable particle @xmath37 at production per dm annihilation can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 represents the contribution from each two - body primary final state @xmath41 with branching fraction @xmath42 to the spectrum of @xmath37 after the decay , fragmentation and hadronization processes have taken place .",
    "we compute @xmath42 from our mssm sommerfeld code as described above and use the tables for @xmath40 provided with the pppc4dmid code  @xcite , which include the leading logarithmic electroweak corrections through the electroweak fragmentation functions  @xcite .",
    "two comments regarding the use of the spectra provided by the pppc4dmid code are in order .",
    "the code only considers primary pairs @xmath41 of a particle together with its antiparticle , both assumed to have the same energy spectrum . for wino - like dm there",
    "exist primary final states with different species , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath43 with @xmath44 , such as @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in this case , we compute the final number of particles @xmath37 produced from that channel as one half of the sum of those produced by channels @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this is justified , since the fragmentation of particles @xmath49 and @xmath50 is independent .",
    "a second caveat concerns the heavy mssm higgs bosons that can be produced for sufficiently heavy neutralinos .",
    "these are not considered to be primary channels in the pppc4dmid code , which only deals with sm particles .",
    "a proper treatment of these primaries would first account for the decay modes of the heavy higgs bosons , and then consider the fragmentation and hadronization of the sm multi - particle final state in an event generator . instead of a full treatment ,",
    "we replace the charged higgs @xmath32 by a longitudinal - polarized @xmath51-boson , and the neutral heavy higgses @xmath52 by the light higgs @xmath53 when computing the spectra in @xmath54 .",
    "this approximation is not very well justified .",
    "however , the branching ratios of the dominantly - wino neutralino to final states with heavy higgses are strongly suppressed , and we could equally have set them to zero without a noticeable effect on our results .",
    "the branching fractions of primary final states obtained from our code are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] as a function of the higgsino fraction for a wino - like lsp with 2  tev mass .",
    "the pure wino annihilates mostly to @xmath55 and to a lesser extent to other pairs of gauge bosons , including the loop - induced photon final state , which is generated by the sommerfeld correction .",
    "the annihilation to fermions is helicity or @xmath56-wave suppressed .",
    "the suppression is lifted only for the @xmath57 final state as the higgsino admixture increases , in which case this final state becomes the second most important .",
    "except for this channel , the dominant branching fractions are largely independent of the higgsino fraction .",
    "the annihilation to @xmath55 is always dominant and above 75% .",
    "the final spectra of photons , positrons and antiprotons per annihilation at production for small ( solid lines ) and large ( dashed lines ) higgsino mixing are plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] .",
    "the spectra in these two extreme cases are very similar , because @xmath58 is the dominant primary final state largely independent of the wino - higgsino composition , and also the number of final stable particles produced by the sub - dominant primary channels do not differ significantly from each other .",
    "the inset in the right - hand plot shows that the relative change between the mixed and pure wino case varies from about @xmath59 to about @xmath60 over the considered energy range .",
    "concerning the variation with respect to the dm mass , the most important change is in the total annihilation cross section , not in the spectra @xmath36 .",
    "the branching ratios @xmath42 to primaries depend on the lsp mass in the tev regime only through the sommerfeld corrections , which can change the relative size of the different channels .",

    "hence , the adopted approximation is expected to be very good and , the corresponding uncertainty is significantly smaller than that related to the astrophysical properties of the dsphs ( parametrised by the @xmath104-factors ) .      the annihilation of dark matter at times around recombination can affect the recombination history of the universe by injecting energy into the pre - recombination photon - baryon plasma and into the post - recombination gas and background radiation , which has consequences for the power and polarization spectra of the cmb  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it can result in the attenuation of the temperature and polarization power spectra , more so on smaller scales , and in a shift of the te and ee peaks .",
    "these effects can be traced back to the increased ionization fraction and baryon temperature , resulting in a broadening of the surface of last scattering , which suppresses perturbations on scales less than the width of this surface . therefore the cmb temperature and polarization angular power spectra can be used to infer upper bounds on the annihilation cross section of dark matter into a certain final state for a given mass .",

    "we use the quantities @xmath115 from  @xcite for a given primary annihilation channel @xmath41 .",

    "the cross section bound can be improved by almost an order of magnitude , until @xmath111 is ultimately limited by cosmic variance .      direct detection experiments probe the interaction of the dark matter particle with nucleons . for the parameter space of interest here ,",
    "the bounds on spin - independent interactions , sensitive to the t - channel exchange of the higgs bosons and to s - channel sfermion exchange are more constraining than those on spin - dependent interactions .",
    "the coupling of the lightest neutralino to a higgs boson requires both a higgsino and gaugino component , and is therefore dependent on the mixing .",
    "note that the relative size of the higgs yukawa couplings means that the contribution due to the higgs coupling to strange quarks dominates the result .    in the pure - wino limit , when the sfermions are decoupled and the coupling to the higgs bosons vanishes , the direct detection constraints are very weak as the elastic scattering takes place only at the loop level @xcite .",
    "allowing for a higgsino admixture and/or non - decoupled sfermions introduces tree - level scattering processes mediated by higgs or sfermion exchange .",
    "direct detection experiments have recently reached the sensitivity needed to measure such low scattering cross sections and with the new data released by the lux @xcite and pandax @xcite collaborations , a portion of the discussed parameter space is now being probed .    in the analysis below",
    "we adopt the lux limits @xcite , being the strongest in the neutralino mass range we consider . in order to be conservative , in addition to the limit presented by the collaboration we consider a weaker limit by multiplying by a factor of two .",
    "this factor two takes into account the two dominant uncertainties affecting the spin - independent cross section , i.e.  the local relic density of dark matter and the strange quark content of the nucleon .",
    "the former , @xmath117 , results in an uncertainty of @xmath118  @xcite and the latter result contributes an uncertainty on the cross section of about @xmath119  @xcite , which on combination result in weakening the bounds by a factor of two ( denoted as @xmath120 on the plots ) . for the computation of the spin - independent scattering cross section for every model point we use micromegas @xcite .",
    "note that the sommerfeld effect does not influence this computation and the tree - level result is expected to be accurate enough .    since only mixed higgsino - gaugino neutralinos couple to higgs bosons ,",
    "the limits are sensitive to the parameters affecting the mixing . to be precise , for the case that the bino is decoupled ( @xmath121 ) and @xmath122 , the couplings of the higgs bosons @xmath123 to the lightest neutralino are proportional to @xmath124 where @xmath125 , and it is further assumed that @xmath26 is heavy such that @xmath126 can be computed in the decoupling limit @xmath127 .",

    "we therefore combine the exclusion limits from indirect searches studied in the previous section with those coming from the latest lux results for direct detection , in order to determine the allowed mixed wino - higgsino or dominantly - wino dark matter parameter space . to this end",

    "the dsphs limit defines the other side in the almost pure - wino region , while the remaining sides of the mixed wino - higgsino area are determined by the dsphs limit ( upper ) , the condition @xmath161 , and the antiproton search ( the arc on the lower side of the mixed region beginning at @xmath162tev ) .",
    "we recall that we consider the central dsphs limit and those obtained by rescaling up and down by a factor of two ; the shading in grey within each region is used to differentiate between these three choices .",
    "next we consider the exclusion limits in the @xmath11 vs.  @xmath12 plane from the 2016 lux results , which have been obtained as outlined in section  [ sec : dd ] .",
    "as discussed there , the sign of @xmath13 can strongly influence the strength of the direct detection limits and consequently the allowed parameter space for mixed wino - higgsino dm .",
    "we therefore consider the two cases separately .",
    "vs @xmath12 plane for @xmath0 where the relic density is as observed and the limit from dsphs diffuse gamma searches is respected within parameter ranges considered . the darker the grey region , the more stringent is the choice of the bound as described in the text .",

    "the fact that the direct detection constraints mainly impact the mixed rather than the pure wino region was discussed in section  [ sec : dd ] , and is understood in that the higgs bosons only couple to mixed gaugino - higgsino neutralinos .",
    "note that the direct detection limits presented on the plot are for the choice of mssm parameters giving the weakest possible constraints .",
    "this is possible because the boundaries of the maximal region allowed by indirect searches do not depend as strongly on the parameters governing the wino - higgsino mixing as the spin - independent scattering cross section does .",
    "the only exceptions are the boundaries of the mixed - wino region , arising from the relic density constraint , which indeed depend strongly on @xmath15 . however , as varying these boundaries does not significantly change the allowed region , since it is mostly in the part excluded by the lux data , we choose to display the lux bound for a value of @xmath15 different from that defining these boundaries .",
    "therefore , all in all , the case of the mixed wino - higgsino with @xmath0 is verging on being excluded by a combination of direct and indirect searches , when imposing that the lightest neutralino accounts for the entire thermally produced dark matter density of the universe .",
    "note , however , that the small close - to - pure wino region is not affected by direct detection constraints .      when @xmath1 the spin - independent cross section decreases , particularly for smaller values of @xmath128 .",
    "this allows for parameter choices with small @xmath12 giving viable neutralino dm , in agreement with the direct detection constraint .",
