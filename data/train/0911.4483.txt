    "detecting the latter two classes of particles would be a clear indication of composite inelastic dark matter .",
    "the signature will be striking because the mass of the dark matter subcomponents would be near - integer multiples of the @xmath17 mass , ending at @xmath230 .",
    "the collider signatures of cidm are challenging because many of the decay products have long lifetimes and give rise to extremely displaced vertices or missing energy . to interpret the results from current @xmath231 colliders ,",
    "it is necessary to have better estimates for the dark hadron multiplicity distributions from dark photon decays . if there are dynamics that stabilize the vev of both the standard model higgs and the dark sector higgs , then it is possible to produce dark sector states at the tevatron and lhc in the decays of electroweak scale particles .",
    "the phenomenology of these events will be similar to that of hidden valley theories , with the majority of parameter space giving rise to extremely displaced vertices @xcite .",
    "beam dump experiments are ideally suited for identifying leptons from particles with a finite lifetime and provide the best prospect for discovering the dark sector through direct production .",
    "proposals for these experiments are presently underway @xcite .",
    "we thank philip schuster for numerous illuminating discussions and thank rouven essig for providing the experimental limits on the @xmath232 plane .",
    "we also thank spencer chang , graham kribs , tuhin roy , aaron pierce , neal weiner , matt reece , natalia toro , and liam fitzpatrick for useful discussions .",
