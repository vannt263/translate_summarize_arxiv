    "at present , the standard model exhibits almost a total success in experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "the only question being a white spot on its body , is the empirical verification of mechanism for the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry . in this respect ,",
    "the minimal model involving a single local higgs field brings a disadvantage : the stability of potential under the quantum loop corrections requires a restriction of quadratic divergency in the self - action by the introduction of `` low '' energy cut - off @xmath11 gev , which is not a natural physical scale standing far away from what can be desirable @xcite : the gut scale , @xmath12 gev @xcite , or even the planck mass , @xmath13 gev .",
    "the reason for putting the @xmath2 so small , has to originate beyond the standard model .",
    "two highways to a `` new physics '' merit the most popularity .",
    "the first one is a technicolor @xcite postulating an extra - strong interaction for new technifermions , which form some `` qcd - like '' condensates , breaking down the electroweak symmetry and giving the masses to the ordinary gauge bosons . despite some problems with the generation of realistic mass values for the quarks and leptons and suppression of flavor changing neutral currents",
    ", the extended technicolor @xcite provides quite a clear picture for what happens in the region deeper than @xmath14 gev .",
    "however , the most strict objection against such the way is the comparison with the current measurements , which disfavor the technicolor models possessing the calculability @xcite .",
    "a general consideration of models with the condensation of heavy fermions is reviewed in ref.@xcite , while a brilliant presentation of both the ideas on the electroweak symmetry breaking with composite operators and techniques as well as results is given in a comprehensive survey by c.t.hill and e.h.simmons @xcite .",
    "however , the condensation , in general , does not provide us with the solution of naturalness .",
    "in fact , this approach reformulates the problem as a fine - tuning phenomenon , since the separation of dynamics responsible for the composite operators at a high scale from the low - energy electroweak physics takes place at effective couplings tuned to some critical values .",
    "therefore , we need an additional argumentation in order to address the naturalness in the framework of condensation mechanism with composite operators .",
    "we present an idea toward this direction below .",
    "the second way is a supersymmetry @xcite reforming the quadratic divergency in the self - action of higgs field into the logarithmic one , so that it prescribes the scale @xmath2 to be a splitting between the particles of standard model and their super - partners .",
    "therefore , the supersymmetry has to be broken in a manner conserving the logarithmic behavior of renormalization , which is an additional challenge to study and a degree of ambiguity .",
    "however , the advantage is the stability of higgs potential , so that @xmath2 certainly is a reasonable scale reflecting the physics in the supersymmetric theory .",
    "what remains is the question : why the basic susy scale is so `` low '' in comparison with the gut scale ?",
    "hence , the naturalness is again the problem standing in the higher - quality context .",
    "if the ultraviolet cut off energy in the loop calculations is placed close to the planck scale ( see fig.[sm ] ) , the standard model suffers from the inherent inconsistency except a narrow window in the range of possible values of higgs particle mass : @xmath15 gev , which does not contradict the value following from the precise measurements of electroweak parameters in the electron - positron annihilation at the @xmath16 boson peak .",
    "( 80,80 ) ( 0,0 )    the reasons for such the inconsistency are the following : at lower masses the vacuum stability is broken , i.e. , the quartic coupling constant of scalar field changes its sign @xcite . at higher masses",
    "the theory enters the strong self - interaction regime , which indicates that the quartic coupling constant becomes infinite ( alike the landau pole ) at a scale less than the offered cut off @xcite .",
    "if the scale of ultraviolet cut off in the sm is much lower than the planck scale , then the region of higgs masses providing the sm consistency , is more wide .",
    "however , such the scales are not natural .",
    "a low cut off scale should indicate a new dynamics . while the vacuum instability is an unavoidable physical constraint ,",
    "the phase of strong higgs self - interaction could be treated in the framework of the following representation : the scalar higgs can be described in terms of the local field below an ultraviolet cut off @xmath2 placed close to the region of strong regime . at virtualities higher than @xmath2 ,",
    "the strongly self - coupled higgs is not fundamental and local quantum .",
    "the dynamics should be described by means of weakly interacting particles , so that a composite operator with appropriate quantum numbers has to correspond to the higgs in the ` dual ' limit implying that the effective potential of the composite operator yields a development of vacuum expectation value for the global ( independent of space - time point ) source of operator .",
    "this strong self - interaction regime could be realized with no involvement of an extended underlying theory alike the technicolor dynamics , since some composite operators can develop an appropriate effective potential in the framework of standard electroweak symmetry .",
    "our assumptions are the followings :    \\1 .",
    "we choose a form of composite operators describing the nonlocal phase of higgs in the strong self - interaction regime ( ssir ) and suppose the connection of such the operators to the higgses .",
    "the suggestion on the nonlocality of higgses allows us to replace the strong self - interaction regime in the theory with the local higgs fields by the weak self - interaction regime ( wsir ) of sources for the composite operators .",
    "the interactions of fermions and gauge bosons in the ssir are given by the dynamics of sm with no local scalar higgses as well as no extensions like a technicolor or so .",
    "\\3 . concerning the position of scale @xmath2 denoting the infrared cut off in the calculations with the composite operators as well as the ultraviolet cut off in the local theory with the scalar higgs , we put it into the ( infrared ) fixed point for the yukawa coupling constants of heaviest fermion in the local theory . the numerical value of @xmath2 is given by the masses of weak - interaction gauge bosons .",
    "we consider yukawa couplings of the only heaviest fermion generation in the sm .    \\5 . in the ssir",
    "we introduce the ultraviolet cut off @xmath17 . at @xmath0",
    "the electroweak symmetry is exactly restored .",
    "we match the effective potential of sources for the composite operators with the potential of corresponding local scalar fields at the scale @xmath2 .",

    "the corresponding contra - terms must be added to the action .",
    "then the @xmath37-source can be integrated out or renormalized , that results in a higgs - like action , containing some couplings to fermions as well as a suitable potential to develop the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "we stress that there are no other suitable composite operators appearing in the second order of sm gauge symmetry with the quantum numbers relevant to the higgs interactions providing the generation of fermion masses through the yukawa - like couplings except the operators described above .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the effective potential up to the quartic term for the sources corresponding to the bi - local composite operators of quarks and leptons to the one - loop accuracy of renormalization in the sm .",
    "the normalization condition of potential parameters : @xmath44 and @xmath45 standing in @xmath46 is strictly defined in the sm , since we do not involve some additional interactions . therefore ,",
    "both @xmath44 and @xmath45 for a nonfundamental source must be equal to zero , exactly , i.e. @xmath47 , which , however , can be satisfied at a single scale @xmath0 because of logarithmic renormalization for couplings , so that @xmath48 it is essential that the choice of composite operators is conformed to the effective action of sm in the second order over the gauge couplings .",
    "otherwise , the introduction of arbitrary composite operators with the given properties with respect to the gauge symmetry generally does not imply the imposition of matching condition in ( [ matchnull ] ) , which is extremely important , since it removes an uncertainty of the potential due to a finite renormalization of parameters .",
    "below @xmath0 , the mass parameter @xmath49 depending on the  infrared cut - off @xmath2 , is positive , and the electroweak symmetry is broken down .",
    "so , we suppose that the bi - local representation is valid in the range of virtualities : @xmath19 $ ] , and below @xmath2 we can explore the local higgs fields .    as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a variety of composite operators appropriate for the higgs quantum numbers can be rearranged so that practically arbitrary values of higgs mass or @xmath7 quark mass could be derived . in other words , in order to get a definite description of higgs sector , one should to suppress contributions by a lot of composite operators except the special ones .",
    "this dominance of several composite operators is usually motivated by an extended dynamics beyond the sm , for instance , by the thechnicolor providing the dominance of some bound channels .",
    "in the present paper , the choice of dominant composite operators is dictated by the sm gauge symmetry , since we isolate the only composite structure in the second order over the gauge couplings , while the appearance of other operators takes place at higher orders , and , hence , their contributions must be suppressed .",
    "moreover , this motivation on the form of composite operators makes us to add the matching condition of ( [ matchnull ] ) , which is a new idea for the composite models , and it is certainly due to the electroweak nature of composite operators .",
    "thus , for a walker travelling from low scales to higher ones , the whole picture of electroweak symmetry breaking looks as the following :    * the sm extension with several higgs fields is the local theory with the ultraviolet cut - off @xmath2 . * the parameters of higgs potential at the scale @xmath2 is matched with the effective potential of bi - local source , calculated in the range @xmath50 $ ] , so that @xmath0 denotes the scale , where the potential is exactly zero .",
    "the value of @xmath2 , hence , can be related with the masses of gauge bosons , or the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath51 for the higgs field in the sm .",
    "the value of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath2 is fixed by two simple requirements : at the matching point @xmath2 the yukawa constant of @xmath7-quark calculated with the composite operators is determined by the condition of infrared fixed point in the local theory @xcite , while the yukawa constant is expressed in terms of abelian gauge coupling at the scales of @xmath2 and @xmath0 due to the consistent matching condition of potential ( [ matchnull ] ) . at fixed @xmath2",
    "this supposition makes @xmath0 to grow to the gut scale , that implies the solution of naturalness .",
    "so , we can read off the third point :    * the yukawa constants of heaviest fermions in the local theory have the matching conditions at @xmath2 to the couplings given by the bi - local representation , so that the infrared fixed point for the @xmath7-quarks is exactly reached .",
    "the masses of @xmath52-quark and @xmath9-lepton can be also calculated after the use of both the definite matching at @xmath2 and infrared fixed points in the rg equations below @xmath2 .",
    "finally , the potential of higgs fields at @xmath2 can serve to estimate the masses of neutral scalar particles by means of rg evolution and the infrared fixed point for the quartic vertex @xmath45 .",
    "the important property of fixed points under consideration is that the yukawa constants and quartic coupling are given by appropriate combinations of gauge coupling constants .",
    "thus , the local theory with the local higgs fields and the electroweak symmetry breaking can be certainly matched to the effective potential of sources for the bi - local composite operators of quarks and leptons at the scale @xmath2 and to the corresponding yukawa constants , which are calculable in the region of virtualities @xmath50 $ ] , so that the fixed point matching of @xmath7-quark coupling and the symmetry matching - condition of null effective potential ( [ matchnull ] ) result in @xmath0 living in the gut area .",
    "then we find the following general results :    \\1 .",
    "three bi - local composite operators formed by the fermions of heaviest generation , develop the effective potential of their sources , so that nonzero vev s break the electroweak symmetry .",
    "we treat these dynamics above the scale @xmath2 as the strong self - interaction regime for three independent scalar higgses as equivalent to the weak self - interaction regime for three independent sources of composite operators .",
    "the position of matching point @xmath53 gev is fixed by the measured masses of gauge bosons , after the higgs sector is given by three independent scalar fields .",
    "\\3 . at @xmath2",
    "the infrared fixed point condition is satisfied for the yukawa coupling of @xmath7 quark , only , while the couplings of @xmath52 quark and @xmath9 lepton evolve to the fixed points at lower scales in agreement with the current data available .",
    "the masses of higgses evolve too .    \\4 . under the item 3 ,",
    "the position of ultraviolet cut off @xmath54 gev with respect to @xmath2 is given by the condition of zero effective potential for the sources of composite operators , that is governed by the renormalization group for the @xmath55 hypercharge , so that we find the natural hierarchy for @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : section ii is devoted to the definition of sources for the bi - local composite operators and calculation of effective potential to the one - loop accuracy .",
    "the masses of gauge bosons and yukawa constants of fermions are evaluated in section iii at the scale @xmath2 .",
    "the exploration of infrared fixed point conditions for the yukawa constants and quartic higgs coupling is considered in section iv .",

    "we put the value @xcite , though it is within the current uncertainty .",
    "however , this parameter corresponds to the lep fit @xcite as well as to the recent global fit of structure functions @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath169 which corresponds to the @xmath170 mev in the three - loop approximation for the @xmath123-function .",
    "we suppose that the threshold values for the changing the number of active quark flavors are equal to @xmath171 gev and @xmath172 gev .",
    "the variation of threshold values is not so important in the estimates in contrast to the uncertainty in @xmath173 , which dominates in the error - bars",
    ".    then we can numerically solve the equations in the previous section to find the current masses @xmath174 the one - loop relation of perturbative qcd for the pole mass of quark @xcite is given by @xmath175 then we estimate @xmath176 the qed correction to the @xmath9-lepton mass is negligibly small .",
    "we see that the @xmath7-quark mass is in a good agreement with the direct measurements .",
    "the @xmath52-quark mass is in the desirable region .",
    "it is close to that of estimated in the qcd sum rules @xcite , where @xmath177 gev @xcite , and in the potential approach @xcite , where @xmath178 gev .",
    "it is worth to note that the pole mass is not the value , which has a good convergency in the ope approach ( see references in @xcite ) , so we present it to the first order for the sake of reference .",
    "however , we stress also that the deviations from the central values are caused by the uncertainties in the @xmath173 running",
    ".    the infrared fixed masses of neutral scalars , coupled with the @xmath7- and @xmath52-quarks and the @xmath9-lepton , equal @xmath179 which can be compared with the global fit of sm at lep yielding @xmath180 gev @xcite .",
    "the central value of this fit was recently excluded by the direct searches at modern lep energies , where the constraint was obtained @xmath181 gev @xcite .",
    "we expect , however , that many - doublet models of higgs sector have a different connection to the lep data .",
    "indeed , the fit of sm with the single higgs particle yields the value for the logarithm @xmath182 = 1.88^{+0.33}_{-0.41}$ ] , whereas this correction basically contributes into the observed quantities due to the coupling to the massive gauge bosons .",
    "then , we can write down the following approximation for this value in the model under consideration : @xmath183,\\ ] ] where the factor @xmath184 represents the fraction of scalar coupling in the squares of gauge boson masses , respectively for @xmath68 , and @xmath185 stands for the possible formfactors at high virtualities of the order of masses of higgs fields . to test , we put the simple approximation @xmath186 which results in @xmath187 close to unit , and @xmath188 , so that the value under consideration is equal to @xmath189 that is optimistically close to what was observed at lep .",
    "so , the values in ( [ hg ] ) are not in contradiction with the current data .",
    "next , since we deal with the strongly coupled version of higgs sector ( remember , that @xmath190 gev ) , we need more careful consideration of effective potential to take into account the higher dimensional operators , representing the multi - higgs couplings .",
    "so , we keep ( [ hg ] ) as soft estimates of masses for the higgs fields , which implies that the decays into the massive gauge bosons are the dominant modes for these scalar particles .",
    "finally , we evaluate the scale @xmath0 , where the electroweak symmetry has to be exactly restored .",
    "the value of @xmath191 is equal to @xmath192 which implies @xmath193 .",
    "the implication of @xmath194 for @xmath0 depends on the running of @xmath195 @xcite : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is model - dependent .",
    "so , in the sm @xmath198 with @xmath199 being the number of fermion generations , @xmath200 is the number of higgs doublets , we obtain for the order - of - magnitude estimate . ]",
    "@xmath201 when in the susy extension @xmath202 , so that @xmath203 hence , we obtain the broad constraints @xmath204 and the value strongly depends on the set of fields in the region above the cut - off @xmath2 . at present , we can not strictly draw a conclusion on a preferable point .",
    "however , we can state that the offered mechanism for the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry solves the problem of naturalness , since the observed `` low '' scale of gauge boson masses is reasonably related to the `` high '' scale of gut or even planck mass .",
    "finally , we comment on possible uncertainties of numerical estimates and a role of two - loop corrections .",
    "first , we analyze the subleading terms in eq.([app1 ] ) .",
    "the gauge charges neglected in the fixed point condition of ( [ app1 ] ) result in the displacement of @xmath7 quark mass by a value about 4 gev , if we do not change the normalization of qcd coupling constant . in this way , we note that under the account of gauge charge corrections in ( [ app1 ] ) the same central value of @xmath7 quark mass , i.e. 165 gev , is reproduced at @xmath205 , which coincides with the particle data group `` world - average '' .",
    "next , the two - loop corrections in the rg equations for the yukawa couplings @xcite as applied to the @xmath7 quark lead to an additional displacement of fixed point value .",
    "however , in this case we have to take into account the one - loop correction to the relation between the current mass and the pole mass of @xmath7 quark due to the higgs sector , that results in the following additive renormalization of @xmath206 @xcite @xmath207 at the higgs mass @xmath208 .",
    "the above correction compensates the displacement due to the two - loop modification of infrared fixed - point condition for the @xmath7 quark .",
    "second , we study the two - loop corrections to the fixed point condition for the @xmath52 quark .",
    "the corresponding modification of ( [ fb ] ) reads off @xmath209 that results in the appropriate correction in ( [ rb ] ) , _ viz .",
    "_ , in the small change of slope in front of log about 2% .",
    "the solution of equations for the running @xmath52 quark mass under the variations caused by the introduction of two - loop corrections and the uncertainty in the coupling constant of qcd is shown in fig .",
    "[ uncert ] .",
    "we can straightforwardly see that the variation of slope in the rg equation for the yukawa constant of @xmath52 quark due to the two - loop corrections results in uncertainties , which are much less than the variation of @xmath52 quark mass caused by the uncertainties in the running coupling constant of qcd at moderate virtualities about the @xmath52 quark mass .",
    "therefore , the dominant origin of uncertainty for the @xmath52 quark mass is the normalization of @xmath173 .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn for the mass of @xmath9 lepton .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty in the estimates of masses for the @xmath52 quark and the @xmath9 lepton is not essentially changed by the introduction of two - loop corrections , while the value of @xmath7 quark mass depends on the normalization of @xmath173 as well as the two - loop corrections combined , so that the uncertainty in the current mass can reach 4 gev in @xmath210 .",
    "( 150,50 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 80,0 ) ( 0,45)@xmath211 ( 80,45)@xmath211 ( 63,-2)@xmath212 ( 140,-2)@xmath212    as for the estimates of masses for the scalar fields , we emphasize that they give preliminary results , and further investigations are in progress , since we should , first , sum up subleading terms with higher powers of the higgs field squared in the effective potential and , second , consider complete rg equations for the quartic self - coupling , including suppressed terms .",
    "nevertheless , our preliminary estimates show that the scalar fields should be significantly heavy .",
    "in the previous sections we have introduced three independent global sources for the bi - local operators composed by the fermions of the heaviest generation , i.e. , @xmath7 quark , @xmath52 quark and @xmath9 lepton . in the ssir , these sources acquire the effective potentials providing the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry . below the scale @xmath2",
    "we assume the connection of such the potentials with the potentials of local higgs fields .",
    "thus , we suppose the introduction of three independent local higgs doublets at the low energies . therefore , we suggest the condensation of sources related with the heaviest generation only .    we have found the ` democratic ' form for the potentials of independent sources in the ssir .",
    "all three potentials have the same values of quadratic and quartic couplings , while we suggest evidently broken ` democracy ' for the fermion generations , since we do not introduce the condensation of sources for the composite operators built of junior fermions .    in this section",
    "we describe a possible development on the problem of fermion generations and the structure of vacuum in the higgs sector .",
    "so , let us introduce the notation of normalized vev s for the global sources connected with the higgs fields as follows : @xmath213 and the corresponding vacua @xmath214 , so that @xmath215 then we easily find that the mass terms @xmath216 could be represented by means of fields @xmath217 as follows @xmath218 where we omit the yukawa couplings and use the matrix @xmath219 defined in terms of @xmath220 .    such the transformation in ( [ trans ] )",
    "relates the ` heavy ' basis of @xmath221 with the ` democratic ' basis of @xmath222 .",
    "so , the definition ( [ trans ] ) can be equivalently changed by permutations of @xmath223 or permutations of columns in the matrix @xmath219 .",
    "such the permutations correspond to the finite cyclic group @xmath224 with the basis @xmath225 , so that complex phases of @xmath222 are given by @xmath226 with the charges @xmath227 of @xmath228 .",
    "further , we can note that the vacuum fields have simple connections as follows : @xmath229 \\left(\\begin{array}{c } \\varphi_1 \\\\ \\varphi_2\\\\ \\varphi_3\\end{array}\\right ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3 } } \\left(\\begin{array}{l } 1 \\\\",
    "\\omega\\\\ \\omega^2\\end{array}\\right ) & \\rightarrow & \\langle 0_t|",
    "\\boldsymbol \\chi_2 |0_t \\rangle = \\langle 0_t| \\left(\\begin{array}{c } \\chi_\\tau \\\\ \\chi_t\\\\ \\chi_b\\end{array}\\right )    \\left(\\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right ) , \\\\[4 mm ] \\left(\\begin{array}{c } \\varphi_1 \\\\ \\varphi_2\\\\ \\varphi_3\\end{array}\\right ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3 } } \\left(\\begin{array}{l } 1 \\\\",
    "\\omega^2\\\\ \\omega\\end{array}\\right ) & \\rightarrow & \\langle 0_b| \\boldsymbol \\chi_3 |0_b",
    "\\rangle = \\langle 0_b| \\left(\\begin{array}{c } \\chi_\\tau \\\\ \\chi_t\\\\ \\chi_b\\end{array}\\right )    \\left(\\begin{array}{c } 0 \\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\end{array}\\right ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the conditions of normalization ( [ norm ] ) are reproduced .",
    "postulate the extended definition of the vacuum _",
    "@xmath230 which implies the @xmath224 symmetry of the vacuum .",
    "then , the couplings introduced in ( [ generation ] ) are extended to three generations of fermions , whereas the only generation of @xmath9 , @xmath7 and @xmath52 is heavy , while two junior generations are massless .",
    "the vacuum definition ( [ vacuum ] ) could be treated as the following assumption :    the number of generations equals the number of charged flavors in the generation as well as the number of higgs fields in the local phase .",
    "thus , we postulate the @xmath224 symmetry of the vacuum as the fundamental dynamical principal of the theory .",
    "moreover , we suggest that this symmetry of the vacuum is exact , so that it is conserved under radiative corrections to the yukawa constants of fermions .    a realistic description of generations , i.e. , a model with nonzero masses of junior fermions is not the problem under the current consideration , and it is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "nevertheless , we add two notes .    first , a general structure of yukawa interactions with the @xmath224 symmetry of the vacuum has the form @xmath231 where the constants @xmath232 can be restricted by the following conditions : @xmath233 are real , while @xmath234 can be complex .",
    "so , the symmetric point @xmath235 restores the hierarchy of single heavy generation and two massless generations .",
    "the development of _ ansatz _ ( [ real ] ) with the realistic values of parameters consistent with the current data on the quark masses and mixing ckm matrix of charged quark currents was given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "second , the same form of mass matrix following from ( [ real ] ) could result in the leading order symmetry in the sector of neutrinos . indeed ,",
    "if we put @xmath236 then we get the completely degenerate neutrinos , while small deviations in the @xmath234 phase and absolute values of @xmath232 will result in small differences of neutrino masses squared as observed in the neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "in this work we have argued that there are three starting points for the presented consideration of higgs sector of electroweak theory .",
    "these motivations are the following :    first , as well known , in the standard model the yukawa coupling constant of @xmath7 quark obtained from the measurement of @xmath7 quark mass , is close to its value in the infrared fixed point derived from the renormalization group equation .",
    "if the higgs sector is extended to three scalar fields separately coupled to three heaviest charged fermions , i.e. , the @xmath7 , @xmath52 quarks and @xmath9 lepton , with the same vacuum expectation values of higgs fields , then the yukawa coupling constant of @xmath7 quark is * exactly * posed to the infrared fixed point .",
    "the challenge is whether this coincidence is accidental or not .",
    "we treat this fact as the fundamental feature of dynamics determining the development of masses .",
    "moreover , the problem acquires an additional insight because the only fermion generation is heavy , while two junior generations are approximately massless .",
    "these features can be attributed by introducing the fundamental @xmath224 symmetry of the vacuum , so that this symmetry is conserved under the radiative loop corrections responsible for the development of nonzero masses of junior generations .",
    "second , the strong self - interaction regime in the higgs sector of standard model at large virtualities can be treated as the indication of nonlocality , i.e. , the compositeness of operators relevant to the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we have introduced a separation of virtuality regions : the local higgs phase in the range of @xmath237 $ ] , the nonlocal strong self - interaction regime in the range @xmath238 $ ] , and the symmetric phase above @xmath0 .",
    "we have determined a form of composite operators and their connection to the local phase by considering the second order of effective action in the sm .",
    "third , the development of effective potential for the global sources of composite operators from the point of symmetric phase @xmath239 gev is stopped in the infrared fixed point @xmath240 gev for the yukawa coupling constant of @xmath7 quark .",
    "if the dynamics of evolution is given by the same electroweak group , then the large logarithm of @xmath241 is close to the value appearing in the calculation of gut scale .",
    "so , since the breaking of electroweak symmetry and the fermion mass generation involve the composite operators with both left and right handed fermions , the gauge interaction of @xmath55 group determines the evolution of parameters of the effective potential in the strong self - interaction regime .",
    "then the logarithm of @xmath241 in the coupling @xmath234 has the value depending on the set of fundamental fields above the scale @xmath2 .",
    "anyway , @xmath0 should be close to the gut scale , and this fact implies the solution of problem on the naturalness .    then , following the above motivations , we have evaluated the basic parameters of the model .",
    "we have calculated the effective potential for the sources of composite operators , responsible for the breaking down the electroweak symmetry and generation of masses for the gauge bosons and heaviest fermions .",
    "the corresponding couplings serve as the matching values for the quadratic and quartic constants in the potential of local higgs fields as well as the yukawa interactions at the scale @xmath2 , which is the ultraviolet cut - off for the local theory and the low boundary of @xmath19$]-range for the effective potential of sources coupled with the bi - local composite operators of quarks and leptons . at @xmath0",
    "the local gauge symmetry is restored , so that the effective potential is exactly equal to zero .",
    "posing the matching of yukawa constant for the @xmath7-quark to the infrared fixed point at the scale @xmath2 , related to the gauge boson masses , we have found the null - potential value @xmath0 in the range of gut park , which indicates the solution of naturalness .",
    "the exploration of fixed points has resulted in the following current masses of heaviest fermions : @xmath4 gev , @xmath5 gev and @xmath6 gev .",
    "two degenerated neutral higgs fields have the infrared fixed mass @xmath8 gev , and the third scalar has the mass @xmath242 gev .",
    "so , the estimates do not contradict with the current constraints , coming from the experimental data .",
    "as we have supposed in the paper , three sectors of higgs fields are coupled to the appropriate heavy fermions , so that we need speculations based on a symmetry causing the junior generations to be massless to the leading order .          to our opinion ,",
    "the susy extension is more complicated , since there are many different relations between the mixtures of various sparticles , which all are expected to be essentially massive ( @xmath243 ) in contrast to the sm , wherein the junior generations are decoupled from the higgs fields to the leading order .",
    "so , @xmath191 transforms its logarithmic behavior to the power dependence on the scale .",
    "then , the @xmath0 returns to a value not far away from the matching point @xmath244 tev , as it should be in the kk approach .        * * m.w.grnewald , in the proceedings of the 29th conference on high energy physics , ichep98 , vancouver , canada , july 1998 , eds .",

    "<S> introducing a source for a bi - local composite operator motivated by the perturbative expansion in gauge couplings , we calculate its effective potential in the renormalization group of standard model with no involvement of technicolor . </S>",
    "<S> the potential indicates the breaking of electroweak symmetry below a scale @xmath0 due to a nonzero vacuum expectation value of neutral component for the @xmath1-doublet operator . at virtualities below a cut off @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the local higgs approximation for the effective fields of sources coupled to the composite operators . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath3 gev is fixed by the measured masses of gauge vector bosons . </S>",
    "<S> the exploration of equations for infrared fixed points of calculated yukawa constants allows us to evaluate the masses of heaviest fermion generation with a good accuracy , so that @xmath4 gev , @xmath5 gev and @xmath6 gev . after a finite renormalization of effective fields for the sources of composite operators , </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of effective higgs field potential are calculated at the scale of matching with the local theory @xmath2 . the fixed point for the yukawa constant of @xmath7 quark and the matching condition for the null effective potential at @xmath0 drive the @xmath0 value to the gut scale . </S>",
    "<S> the equation for the infrared fixed point of quartic self - action allows us to get estimates for two almost degenerate scalar particles with @xmath8 gev , while third scalar coupled with the @xmath9 lepton is more heavy : @xmath10 gev </S>",
    "<S> . some phenomenological implications of the offered approach describing the effective scalar field , and a problem on three fermion generations are discussed . </S>"
