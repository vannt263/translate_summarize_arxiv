    "anderson had postulated , already in his original paper on localization , that closed many - body systems undergoing time evolution would not come to thermal equilibrium if subject to sufficiently strong randomness @xcite .",

    "@xcite , to understand this phenomenon , the only known generic exception to thermalization ( see e.g. @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the recent work led to classification of many - body localization ( mbl ) as a distinct dynamical phase of matter , characterized by a remarkable set of defining properties : ( i ) there are locally accessible observables that do not relax to their equilibrium values and hence can be related to a set of quasi - local integrals of motion @xcite ; ( ii ) even after arbitrarily long time evolution retrievable quantum information persists in the system and may be extracted from local degrees of freedom @xcite ; ( iii ) entanglement entropy grows with time evolution only as a logarithmic function of time @xcite .    in spite of the progress in understanding the mbl phase ,",
    "very little is known about the dynamical phase transition which separates it from the delocalized thermal phase .",
    "part of the difficulty lies in the fundamental difference between the energy eigenstates found on either side of the transition .",
    "eigenstates in the thermal phase are expected to obey the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis , which , in particular , implies extensive ( i.e. volume law ) entanglement entropy .",
    "the non - locality of quantum mechanics is fully exploited in such states , where information resides in highly non local entities : the exponentially many expansion coefficients of the wave - function in terms of local basis states . on the other hand , in the many - body localized phase",
    "the eigenstates feature area - law entanglement entropy akin to quantum ground states .",
    "hence this dynamic quantum phase transition separating these two types of eigenstates is unlike any other known phase transition .",
    "ground state quantum critical points and dynamical critical points which occur inside the localized phase mark transitions between area - law states , whereas thermal critical points are transitions between distinct states with extensive ( i.e. volume law ) entropy .",
    "the need to describe this critical point , where the eigenstates change from area law to volume law entanglement , and hence the quantum information in some sense escapes from localized degrees of freedom to highly non - local ones , calls for a new theoretical approach . in this paper",
    "we develop a strong disorder renormalization group framework which can address this many - body localization phase transition .",
    "we find a transition controlled by an infinite randomness rg fixed point , where the broad distributions are of a scaling variable directly related to the entanglement entropy of the system s eigenstates .",
    "thus , using this rg scheme we obtain finite size scaling results for the probability distribution of the entanglement entropy near this phase transition .",
    "a corollary of the analysis is that the phases adjacent to this critical point are griffiths phases@xcite , where some properties are dominated by rare regions ( see also @xcite ) . on the delocalized side of the transition",
    ", there is a _ thermal _ griffiths phase showing anomalous ( sub - diffusive ) transport and sub - linear entanglement growth under time evolution , due to rare , locally insulating regions that impede the transport but do not prevent thermalization .    before proceeding ,",

    "this indeed turns out to be related to the main scaling variable in our theory .",
    "grover @xcite showed that the eigenstates at this critical point have volume - law entanglement of small subsystems .",
    "recent numerical work , which focused on the vicinity of the transition has identified and explored the sub - diffusive regime in the vicinity of the transition @xcite .",
    "finally , a very recent work explores an rg approach to the mbl transition in random anyonic spin chains @xcite .    in this paper , we present a comprehensive theory which naturally explains and unifies the different phenomena associated with dynamics and entanglement near the many - body localization phase transition . in section [ sec : scheme ]",
    "we define a minimal effective model , designed to capture the essence of the many - body localization transition .",
    "we lay - out a strong - disorder renormalization group approach that is later used to analyze the universal properties of the effective model .",
    "the rg flow of the coupling distributions are characterized in section [ sec : flows ] .",
    "there , we identify an infinite randomness fixed point that controls the flow near the many - body localization transition . in section [ sec : entropy ] we show that an eigenstate entropy variable , closely related to the entanglement entropy , emerges as a natural scaling variable at the critical point .",
    "the results indicate a universal jump of this eigenstate entropy from a number of order one in the insulating phase to the full thermal entropy in the delocalized phase through a critical point where the entropy is broadly distributed . in section",
    "[ sec : transport ] we use the rg flow to study the energy transport and propagation of entanglement through the system , showing , in particular , that the dynamical critical exponent @xmath5 diverges on approaching the critical point from the ergodic side .",
    "this dynamical critical behavior is explained in section [ sec : griffiths ] within an effective model of the griffiths phase found on the delocalized side of the transition . finally , in section [",
    "sec : conclusions ] , we summarize and discuss the results .     and",

    "( b ) the model after the basic rg step of joining the pair of blocks with the fastest inter - block thermalization rate @xmath7 . ]",
    "a strong disorder renormalization group scheme has been developed recently to describe the dynamics within the many - body localized phase @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , neglects resonances , i.e. non - local modes involving many of the microscopic degrees of freedom . because these are the very processes that lead to delocalization , a new approach , which incorporates the physics of resonances , is needed in order to describe the many - body localization transition .",
    "the microscopic systems we have in mind include disordered spin chains as well as interacting lattice particles hopping in a random potential in one dimension .",
    "but in order to capture the effect of resonances we will concede the fully microscopic starting point and instead work with an effective coarse grained model of the system , which we expect nonetheless provides a faithful description of the system near the critical point .",
    "we are able to consider within the same framework closed systems with energy conservation as well as periodically driven ( floquet ) systems , which lack any conservation laws other than the unitarity and locality of their time evolution . for convenience",
    ", we work at the energy density that corresponds to infinite temperature when the system thermalizes . regardless of microscopic details",
    ", we assume that sufficiently close to the critical point the system can be viewed as being composed of blocks @xmath8 of varying lengths @xmath9 , which locally behave more like insulators or more like thermalizing systems .",
    "we define the length @xmath10 of a block as the binary logarithm of the dimension @xmath11 of its hilbert space , so @xmath12 .",
    "thus for a disordered spin-1/2 chain @xmath10 is the number of spins in the block .",
    "when a block is considered in isolation , if it is an insulating block the eigenstates of its hamiltonian typically exhibit only short - range entanglement on length scales shorter than the length of the block .",
    "these insulating blocks , when isolated , contain conserved operators with localization length shorter than the block , and as a result the many - body spectra of such insulating blocks have nearly poisson level statistics .",
    "on the other hand , in locally thermalizing blocks , long range resonances have proliferated enough that such blocks , even when isolated , do not contain conserved operators that are localized on scales shorter than the block length .",
    "the eigenstates of these thermalizing blocks thus exhibit entanglement that extends from one end of the block to the other , and as a result their spectra have nearly wigner - dyson level statistics .",
    "more generally , there is a dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath13 for each block , with @xmath14 being the insulating limit , @xmath15 being the fully conducting limit , and the crossover between the insulating and thermalizing regimes occuring near @xmath16 .",
    "our coarse grained model consists of a chain of coupled blocks as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model](a ) , where each single block and each pair of adjacent blocks is characterized by a minimal set of parameters as described below .",
    "at the basis of the rg scheme lies the assumption that this is the minimal set of parameters required to capture the universal behavior at the critical point .",
    "note that the hilbert space dimension @xmath11 of the coarse grained model of a chain of @xmath3 microscopic spins-1/2 is still @xmath17 , exactly as the bare model .",
    "thus we do not `` integrate out '' states .",
    "however , the retained information is reduced because we now keep only a few parameters for each block @xmath8 of @xmath9 spins . in the course of renormalization",
    ", pairs of adjacent blocks are joined into longer blocks , so the total number of retained parameters is steadily reduced .    to identify the parameter @xmath13 for a given block @xmath8 it is useful to consider the time and energy scales that characterize the block .",
    "of course each block is characterized by a typical many - body level spacing @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a microscopic bare energy scale .",
    "in addition there is a parameter @xmath20 that we call the `` entanglement thermalization rate '' ( or simply entanglement rate ) , set by the time it takes quantum information to propagate from one end of the block to the other end . then @xmath21 .",
    "note , we are using a `` minimalist '' rg where the properties of each block ( and each pair of blocks ) are described by just these two energy scales , @xmath20 and @xmath22 .",
    "we are assuming that at least some of the universal features of the phase transition can be captured by such a rg .",
    "physically , @xmath23 can be viewed as an `` entanglement thouless time '' for block @xmath8 in the following sense : initialize block @xmath8 in one of the eigenstates of its time evolution when it is isolated .",
    "then put one end of block @xmath8 in strong local contact with a much longer block @xmath24 that is a good conductor @xmath25 .",
    "initialize this two - block system in a pure product state with no entanglement between the two blocks . under the unitary time evolution of these two",
    "now coupled ( but otherwise isolated ) blocks , the entanglement entropy will then grow and saturate on time scale @xmath26 , with the final value close to the thermal equilibrium entropy of the smaller block @xmath8 .",
    "thus we can call @xmath27 the entanglement - thermalization time of block @xmath8 ; it is the time for entanglement , and thus thermalization , to spread across the full length of the block . in principle , with knowledge of the microscopic couplings one could attempt to compute this time , but here the @xmath28 of the blocks are taken as inputs for the rg scheme .",
    "it is noteworthy that @xmath29 is not the energy transport time .",
    "the latter , denoted by @xmath30 , is the time scale to relax an extensive energy imbalance across the block . on the end - to - end entanglement time - scale @xmath27",
    "the amount of energy transported across the block remains of order the microscopic energy scale , so is not extensive . to relax an extensive energy imbalance requires transporting an extensive ( in @xmath9 ) amount of energy , so requires of order @xmath9 entanglement times .",
    "hence @xmath31 .",
    "note that the entanglement time @xmath27 is well defined even in a system subject to external periodically time dependent fields , such as a floquet system , where total energy is not conserved and there is no extensive quantity that can be transported , so the transport time is meaningless .",
    "the two - block parameters , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , are defined as the block parameters that would ensue if the two adjacent blocks are treated as a single block .",
    "for instance @xmath35 .",
    "we call the link between these adjacent blocks @xmath8 and @xmath24 `` effective '' if @xmath36 and `` ineffective '' if @xmath37 . a general requirement to be met by the initial distributions and retained throughout the rg flow is that the smallest block rate @xmath38 is larger than the largest two - block rate @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 , the largest two - block rate , serves as the running rg frequency cutoff scale . in this way all the fast rates ( @xmath41 ) are intra - block , while the slow rates , below the cutoff scale , are inter - block",
    "we now frame the rg as a strong disorder scheme operating on the chain in real space . at each rg",
    "step the cutoff scale @xmath40 is reduced by joining the two blocks with the largest inter - block rate @xmath7 .",
    "thus the old two - block parameters become the new one - block parameters of this new larger block .",
    "the non trivial part of the renormalization is to determine the new two - block parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which connect the new block to its left and right neighbors . to compute these rates we have to solve for the entanglement rate of three coupled blocks .",
    "this calculation can not be done microscopically in the most general case , but the structure of the solution is rather constrained by the known behavior in limiting cases .",
    "these constraints allow us to formulate a closed and self consistent rg scheme .",
    "modifying details of the rg scheme within the allowed constraints does not significantly change the outcome .",
    "suppose we are now joining blocks 1 and 2 with the fastest two - block rate @xmath44 and want to find the new rate @xmath43 of the three block system @xmath45 .",
    "there are two limits in which we can obtain simple reliable expressions for this rate .",
    "first , if both links are ineffective , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then we can compute @xmath43 by straight forward perturbation theory in the weak dimensionless couplings ( see appendix a ) to obtain _ r=_12_23/_2  .",
    "[ rg1 ] this case describes the process of making a bigger insulator out of two insulating links .",
    "when applied repeatedly to a long insulating chain this rule indeed leads to the expected exponential increase of the entanglement time with the length of the insulator .",
    "second , if both links lead to effective coupling , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , then the entanglement spreads sequentially through the three block chain and we must add the entanglement times @xmath50 : = 1_12 + 1_23 - 1_2  .",
    "[ rg2 ] in a system with energy conservation the above formula is simply ohm s law for the thermal resistances .    .",
    "summary of rg rules .",
    "derivations are given in appendix [ app : fgr ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the two rg rules given above lead to the correct scaling of length and time in insulating regions ( @xmath51 ) and fully conducting regions ( @xmath52 ) . to complete the rg scheme we have to determine the behavior of boundaries between insulating(i ) and",
    "thermalizing ( t ) regions , where we encounter three block systems with one effective link @xmath48 and one ineffective link @xmath47 .",
    "we have to distinguish the case in which the effective link is a link between two metallic blocks from the case when it is a link between a metallic and an insulating block .    first consider the case that the effective link is between two conductors ( the link between two conductors is always effective as explained in appendix a ) .",
    "we test the three block system tti by coupling a thermal reservoir to the insulating end . at time",
    "scale longer than @xmath53 that the insulator has been thermalized the reservoir has in effect a direct coupling to the conducting blocks , hence the total ( entanglement ) propagation time is still sequential and rule ( [ rg2 ] ) is in effect .",
    "now we turn to the case that the effective coupling @xmath48 is between a thermalizing block and an insulating block ( or between two insulators ) .",
    "but although the coupling @xmath54 ultimately turns out to be effective connecting a conductor to an insulator leads to exponential suppression of the relaxation rate with the length of the insulator .",
    "coupling this ti or it structure to yet another insulator , i.e. the sequences tii or iti would only lead to further exponential suppression ( see also appendix [ app : fgr ] ) , hence insulating - like scaling of @xmath55 as prescribed in the rg rule ( [ rg1 ] ) .",
    "note that application of rg rule ( [ rg2 ] ) to these cases would lead to the unphysical situation in which a single conducting block t embedded in an infinite insulating chain would be able to thermalize the entire chain . on the other hand either rule ( [ rg1 ] ) or ( [ rg2 ] ) may be applied consistently in the case tit ( when @xmath48 ) . since we find that the structure of the critical flow is completely unchanged whichever of the two rules is applied in this case , we choose to apply rule ( [ rg1 ] ) .",

    "we did not give expressions for intermediate regimes where @xmath56 .",

    ", we simply simulate the rg process on an ensemble of chains , each with up to @xmath69 or more initial blocks .",
    "each block in the initial state is taken to be a @xmath70 matrix with uniform @xmath71 and @xmath16 , so the initial block lengths are @xmath72 .",

    "although we start with moderate randomness , and only on the links , near the critical point the rg flows rapidly to strong randomness in all parameters .    before proceeding to present the results we note that to test for universality we also repeated the calculations using different parameters @xmath82 in the bare distributions and changing the initial matrix size to @xmath83 ( this affects the distribution of the level spacings ) .",
    "while the precise position of the critical point is changed , all the universal aspects of the results presented below ( i.e. all the scaling exponents ) remain exactly the same .",

    "the inset inset indeed shows excellent data collapse on the insulating side with a scaling form @xmath96 .",
    "the fact that the critical behavior is manifest only in the `` average '' variable @xmath67 suggests that the critical fluctuations consist of rare long thermalizing clusters inside the insulator .",
    "the contribution of such clusters is killed by the averaging @xmath64 but can dominate @xmath95 .",
    "it is important to establish infinite randomness scaling at the critical point as a posteriori justification of the rg scheme , in which we have assumed that the links realize extreme situations with either @xmath62 or @xmath60 .",
    "the fact that the critical point is characterized by broad distributions of @xmath57 is already apparent in the crucial differences , discussed above , between the average and typical values of @xmath57 at the critical point .",
    "the precise flow of distributions to infinite randomness is usually characterized @xcite by how the variance of the relevant scaling variables grows with the the rg flow parameter @xmath97 .    to justify the rg scheme it is particularly important to characterize the fluctuations in @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath99 .",

    "<S> the system does thermalize in this griffiths phase . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the many - body localization transition is controlled by a new kind of infinite randomness rg fixed point , where the broadly distributed scaling variable is closely related to the eigenstate entanglement entropy . </S>",
    "<S> dynamically , the entanglement grows as @xmath1 at the critical point , as it also does in the localized phase . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) in the vicinity of the critical point the ratio of the entanglement entropy to the thermal entropy , and its variance ( and in fact all moments ) are scaling functions of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the length of the system and @xmath4 is the correlation length , which has a power - law divergence at the critical point .    </S>",
