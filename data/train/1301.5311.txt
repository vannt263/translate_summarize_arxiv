    "one fruitful approach consists of defining infinite random maps which are the so - called _ local limits _ of random planar maps and studying their properties .",

    "an important area of research on the random lattices @xmath27 is to understand the behavior of statistical mechanics models on them .",
    "angel @xcite already studied site percolation on the uipt and in particular proved that the critical percolation threshold is almost surely @xmath28 . in this paper , we extend this analysis to several other types of percolation , including both bond and site on both the map and its plane dual .",
    "we pursue the analysis of percolation on random maps by focusing on half - planar models .",
    "these models indeed have an especially useful spatial markov property which makes the analysis of the percolation process much simpler ( see @xcite for a study of this property ) .",
    "these pages can thus be seen as a step towards the analysis of percolations on the full - plane uip@xmath15 , which we do in a subsequent paper @xcite .    in order to construct these half - plane models",
    "we first extend to maps with a _ boundary _ : a triangulation ( or a quadrangulation ) with a _ boundary _ is a planar map whose faces are triangles ( resp.quadrangles ) except the face incident on the right of the distinguished oriented edge which can be of arbitrary degree .",

    "[ [ percolation . ] ] percolation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + +    having introduced the random lattices , let us specify the models of percolation that we will discuss . conditionally on @xmath42 , we consider bernoulli percolation on the edges , vertices or faces , that is , we color the elements of the map white with probability @xmath44 and black with probability @xmath45 independently from each other , and consider the structure of connected white clusters .",
    "if we color the edges , we speak of bond percolation , if we color the vertices we speak of site percolation .",
    "coloring faces yields site percolation on the dual of the map ( two faces are adjacent if they share an edge ) and will be called `` face percolation '' in this work .    in the triangular case @xmath46 , site percolation",
    "has already been analyzed in @xcite where it is proved that @xmath47 .",
    "the techniques developed in this paper do not apply to site percolation on general planar maps ( other than triangulations ) and for example the value of @xmath48 is still unknown .",
    "however in the case of _ bond _ or _ face _ percolation we prove that the critical percolation thresholds are almost surely constant and can be expressed by a universal formula relying on a unique parameter depending on the model .",
    "to give their values , we introduce for each model of planar map a quantity @xmath49 .",
    "this quantity is well defined and can be computed for fairly general models of planar maps . in the main classes we study we have @xmath50    [ thm : thresholds ] for",
    "@xmath17 , the critical thresholds for bond and face percolations are almost surely constant and are given by @xmath51    we prove that in each model considered in [ thm : thresholds ] , at the critical probability , there is no infinite cluster .",
    "we also study the associated dual percolations , which in the case of bond percolation is just bond percolation on the dual lattice ( edges in a map are in bijection with edges in the dual map , so bond percolation on a map and on its dual use the same randomness , and are dual to each other ) and prove the unsurprising identity @xmath52 in the case of face percolation , the dual percolation is the same percolation but where faces are declared adjacent if they share a vertex .",
    "we call it the face@xmath53 percolation ; here also @xmath54",
    ".    the universal form of the critical probability thresholds expressed in [ thm : thresholds ] in terms of @xmath55 holds in a much larger list of maps than the ones we consider in this work and could be applied , e.g.  to pentagulations , general planar maps or planar maps with boltzmann distribution , see @xcite .",
    "the only quantity to compute would be the equivalent of @xmath55 defined in [ prop : mean ] .",
    "notice also that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are functions of each other . if an oracle such as a physics conjecture or a self - duality property , etc.furnishes one of the two thresholds then [ thm : thresholds ] automatically gives the other .    in relation to @xcite , one key idea which enables us to treat bond percolation is to keep as much randomness as we can during the exploration process .",
    "in other words , even after being discovered in the map , the status of an edge can be kept random until it is necessary for the exploration process to know its color .",
    "[ [ critical - exponents . ] ] critical exponents .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in contrast with the critical threshold values which depend on the local features of model considered , we also compute a few critical exponents which are not model - depend .",
    "the exploration of percolation interfaces in random maps involves random walks with heavy - tailed step distribution in the domain of attraction of a totally asymmetric ( spectrally negative ) stable law of parameter @xmath58 .",
    "using standard results for heavy - tailed random walks we are able to compute critical exponents related to the perimeter ( boundary ) and the volume of critical percolations clusters .",
    "for sake of simplicity we restricted our proof to the case of site percolation on triangular lattices but there is no doubt that our methods could be adapted to more general cases and would yield the same critical exponents .",
    "we now make our setting precise . in @xmath59",
    "we consider the hull @xmath60 of the cluster of a unique white vertex among a full black boundary .",
    "that is , we fill the finite holes in the map created by the cluster .",
    "we will consider the volume @xmath61 of @xmath60 that is its number of vertices and its boundary @xmath62 which is the number of vertices of @xmath60 adjacent to @xmath63 .",
    "we shall also consider the extended hull @xmath64 which is the hull formed by all the triangles adjacent to @xmath60 .",
    "more precisely we are interested in the boundary @xmath65 of this extended hull .",
    "[ thm : criticexpo ] at the critical percolation threshold @xmath66 , we have the following estimates @xmath67    here and later we use the notation @xmath68 to denote that @xmath69 is bounded below and above by some absolute constants .",
    "the estimates we get in the proof are significantly more explicit than the above statement . in particular , for @xmath70 and @xmath71 we get lower and upper bounds with only a poly - logarithmic correction , see [ sec : exponents ] .",
    "of course , we expect these asymptotics to hold with no correction to the polynomial term .",
    "as can be seen in the last theorem the perimeter of the hull and the perimeter of the extended hull have completely different exponents : after filling - in the `` fjords '' created by a percolation cluster we drastically reduces its perimeter .",
    "this fact is well - known in the physicist literature and it well understood for site percolation on the regular triangular lattice thanks to the sle processes .",
    "one motivation for this research is the physics theory of @xmath12-dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "in particular the kpz relation @xcite predicts connections between critical exponents of statistical mechanics models on a regular lattice and on a random lattice : if a set defined in terms of a percolation process on a fixed regular lattice has dimension @xmath72 and and the corresponding set defined in terms of percolation has `` dimension '' @xmath73 , then the kpz relation states that @xmath74 for models other than percolation a similar relation holds , with the coefficients in the quadratic relation given in terms of the so - called central charge @xmath75 associated with the model .",
    "while there is some recent progress towards understanding this relation in the work of duplantier & sheffield @xcite , the kpz relation remains unproved .",
    "our work gives another strong indication that the relation does hold for critical percolation interface and boundary of the hull generated , in other words for sle@xmath76 and sle@xmath77 .",
    "this relation has already been checked for various other sets including e.g.  pioneer points of simple random walk @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in [ sec : peeling ] we present in a unified way some enumeration results on random planar maps and introduce the spatial markov property as well as the peeling process which are the key ingredients of this work .",
    "[ sec : threshold ] is devoted to identifying the critical threshold parameters presented in [ thm : thresholds ] .",

    "a * peeling process * is a randomized algorithm that consists of exploring @xmath78 by revealing at each step one face , together with any finite regions that it encloses .",

    "we can thus reveal the face in @xmath181 adjacent to this edge and deduce from the previous section that @xmath182 is independent of the union of @xmath173 and of the finite regions discovered by this operation .",

    "hence [ prop : vraipeeling ] applies , at least as long as the boundary of @xmath179 contains a white region necessary to designate the next point to peel .",

    "if that happens , a simple topological argument shows that the white cluster @xmath187 must be finite ( see [ fig : explorationsite ] ) .",
    "if the process does not terminate then @xmath187 is infinite .",
    "let @xmath195 for @xmath196 be the number of white vertices on the boundary of @xmath168 . thus @xmath197 . if @xmath198 then @xmath195 is defined and positive for all @xmath172 . on the other hand ,",

    "let each face of @xmath78 be colored independently white with probability @xmath219 and black otherwise .",
    "face percolation does not have any apparent boundary condition , but in a sense we explain now , it does .",
    "let us color the infinite external face in black , which corresponds to an all black boundary condition .",
    "as far as percolation clusters are concerned , this is equivalent to adding an extra face adjacent to each boundary edge and colouring it black .",
    "we do this for all boundary edges _ except for the root edge_. for the root edge , we add a white external face see [ fig : explorationdual ] .",

    "for the lower bound , observe that at each step of the peeling the probability of having @xmath361 is some constant ( @xmath362 as it happens ) .",
    "thus the number of triangles on the interface incident to any vertex of @xmath353 is dominated by a geometric random variable . moreover",
    ", these dominating random variables may be made independent .",
    "( that is , there is a coupling of independent geometric variables and the map so that the domination holds a.s . ) by a standard large deviation estimate for sums of random variables , for suitable constants , @xmath363 with [ lemma : t- ] this gives the lower bound .",
    "the volume of the hull @xmath61 , can be measured in vertices or faces .",
    "we work below with vertices , though the two are directly connected for triangulations in terms of the boundary which is smaller by @xmath349 , and so the number of faces is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "faces have a slight advantage of in that faces are added to the hull in one way only , as the enclosed triangulations encountered on the right of the peeling process when we enclose a region and fill it in with a boltzmann triangulation of the proper perimeter , whereas vertices may also be on the boundary .",
    "special care is needed again for the last peeling step because the triangulation put inside the last peeling step is not entirely contained in the hull .",
    "let @xmath364 be the number of vertices added to the hull in the @xmath206th step .",
    "this is @xmath11 when a new internal vertex is discovered . when @xmath365 , this is the number of internal vertices in the boltzmann map added , except at the last step when only part of that map is in the hull",
    "thus we have @xmath366 a simple observation using the formulae for @xmath367 shows that a boltzmann triangulation with perimeter @xmath31 typically has a size of order @xmath368 . more precisely from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6.4 ) there exists @xmath340 such that for all @xmath369 and @xmath370 we have @xmath371 \\sim \\frac{2}{3}p^2 \\quad \\mbox{and } \\quad      { \\mathbb p}(z_{i } > \\lambda p^2 | { \\mathcal r}_{i } = p ) \\leq c \\lambda ^{-3/2}\\ ] ] for some @xmath340 .",
    "in fact by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 6.4 ) the distribution of the size of a boltzmann triangulation of perimeter @xmath31 renormalized by @xmath368 converges towards a lvy distribution .    for the lower bound",
    ", we exhibit a way for @xmath60 to have size @xmath20 with probability of order @xmath372 : first the peeling process continues for at least @xmath373 steps that is @xmath374 .",
    "this has probability of order @xmath372 by [ lemma : t- ] . on this event , there are typically ( several ) times before @xmath359 when @xmath375 is of order @xmath376 , so with probability bounded from @xmath136 there is at least one such jump of size at least @xmath377 .",
    "such a jump adds to the hull a boltzmann triangulation of perimeter of order @xmath378 which is typically of size @xmath20 by .",
    "thus on the event that @xmath379 there is at least a constant probability that @xmath380 , and so @xmath381 for some @xmath382 .",
    "informally , the reason this is the typical way of getting a large hull is that it is easier to make @xmath359 even larger ( exponent @xmath383 ) than to have @xmath359 smaller and have an unusually large boltzmann map ( exponent @xmath384 ) .",
    "it is also possible to have @xmath359 small and no abnormally large boltzmann map , but this requires the discrete stable process to behave badly , which is even less likely .    to prove the corresponding upper bound we start by ignoring the last step @xmath359 , and first split according to @xmath385 : @xmath386 the first summand is at most a constant times @xmath372 , so we focus on the second and apply markov s inequality : @xmath387.\\ ] ] using we have that @xmath388 \\lesssim    1+{\\mathcal r}_i^2 $ ] ( allowing for @xmath389 ) .",
    "so after conditioning on @xmath390 and taking the @xmath11 terms outside the sum we end - up with @xmath391 \\right).\\ ] ] to compute the @xmath392 $ ] we need first to truncate it . on the event",
    "@xmath393 we have @xmath394 ( since @xmath195 increases by at most @xmath11 at each step ) . by [ lem : expotail ]",
    "we have that @xmath395 .",
    "thus with very high probability ( super - polynomially close to @xmath11 ) @xmath396 this allows us to truncate the @xmath375s : for some @xmath351 we have @xmath397   \\leq    c + { \\mathbb e}\\left[{\\mathcal r}_i^2 \\mathbf{1}_{\\tau > i } \\mathbf{1}_{{\\mathcal r}_i < \\sqrt{n }        \\log^2 n } \\right].\\ ] ]    the next step is to separate the restriction to @xmath398 . for this",
    "we observe that the events @xmath399 and @xmath400 are negatively correlated since a larger negative jump can only help the process hitting @xmath234 .",
    "thus conditioning on @xmath401 stochastically decreases @xmath375 and we have @xmath402    \\leq { \\mathbb p}\\big(\\tau > i\\big )         { \\mathbb e}\\big[{\\mathcal r}_i^2 \\mathbf{1}_{{\\mathcal r}_i",
    "< \\sqrt{n } \\log^2 n } \\big ]    \\lesssim i^{-1/3 } n^{1/4 } \\log n,\\ ] ] where we have used the tail distribution of @xmath359 and the easy estimate @xmath403 \\lesssim \\sqrt{m}$ ] .",
    "plugging this in we find @xmath404    this almost completes the proof .",
    "it remains to show that the contribution from the last step when @xmath405 hits @xmath234 is also unlikely to be large .",
    "here we do not have @xmath406 because of the undershoot below @xmath136 .",
    "let us call @xmath407 this last jump and let @xmath113 be the size of the boltzmann map added during this last jump .",
    "again , we may restrict to the event @xmath408 and shall split according to the value of @xmath359 . by we have @xmath409 on the other hand we have for @xmath144 @xmath410 using [ lem : expotail ] and the bound @xmath411 we have @xmath412 \\lesssim ( i+1)$ ] so @xmath413 .",
    "finally @xmath414      in order to study @xmath415 we consider the evolution of the boundary of @xmath64 as the peeling process progresses .",
    "a new difficulty is that only after the process has terminated we can tell with certainty whether any particular vertex is in @xmath415 or not . as we follow the peeling process ,",
    "newly revealed black vertices are added _",
    "tentatively _ to @xmath415 , but are removed from it if they are in a part of the boundary that is swallowed by a connection to the left of the peeling edge . in order to control the tail of @xmath415 ,",
    "let us introduce an auxiliary process @xmath416 , which follows the evolution of the black boundary left of @xmath187 .",
    "this length is of course infinite always , so instead we follow only the change of this boundary , in the form of vertices added and removed from the boundary .",
    "formally let @xmath417 be the number of edges swallowed _ on the left _ of the @xmath206th peeling point .",
    "we have that @xmath418 have the same law as @xmath419 , though @xmath417 is not independent of @xmath375 .",
    "recall also that @xmath204 is the indicator of the event that this new vertex is white .",
    "we form the process @xmath420 by putting @xmath421 and @xmath422 thus @xmath423 is just a random walk with i.i.d .",
    "increments distributed as @xmath292 .",
    "note that the two walks @xmath424 and @xmath420 are not independent , since they use the same @xmath150 and @xmath286 sequences , and since when @xmath425 , @xmath426 are not independent .    with this notation we can determine @xmath65 from @xmath420 and @xmath359 .",
    "whenever @xmath423 reaches its infimum , all the black vertices discovered so far are swallowed .",
    "the vertices tentatively in @xmath415 correspond exactly to increments of @xmath423 above its infimum . thus if we denote @xmath427 , then @xmath428    while the processes @xmath420 and @xmath424 ( and in particular @xmath359 ) are not precisely independent , they are quite close to independent in the following sense .",
    "recall that we are considering only triangulations for now , so either @xmath389 or @xmath429 ( possibly both ) . since newly discovered vertices are also either black or white but not both , each step of the peeling process changes at most one of @xmath423 and @xmath294 .",
    "it follows that if we switch to continuous time with peeling steps controlled by a poisson clock then the two processes become completely independent . for other tyes of maps and percolation models",
    "a slightly weaker form of independence holds ( see [ sec : modifications ] ) .    to get a lower bound on @xmath430 ,",
    "consider the event @xmath431 .",
    "this event has probability equal to a constant times @xmath432 by [ lemma : t- ] .",
    "conditioned on this event , by the above remarks , the process @xmath433 is roughly distributed as @xmath20 times @xmath434 , where @xmath435 is the airy - stable process introduced in the beginning of the section , and in particular the conditional probability of @xmath436 is bounded away from @xmath136 .",
    "let us prove the corresponding upper bound . since @xmath423 is a sum i.i.d .",
    "variables with @xmath136 mean , bounded above by @xmath11 and in the domain of attraction of a @xmath437-stable variable , we have from [ lem : expotail ] for any @xmath438 that @xmath439 and so @xmath440 for @xmath441 the exponential term easily dominates and we have that @xmath442 decays super - polynomially ( faster than @xmath443 ) . on the other hand , @xmath444 , and the proof is finally complete .      in this section",
    "we comment on the modifications to make to the previous section if we consider face or bond percolation on general @xmath78 .",
    "we endeavor to address all the different difficulties that arise , and some possible ways to overcome them .",
    "however , a full proof would involve some nasty details and so we stay at a rather high and ( very ) imprecise level , and formally state [ thm : criticexpo ] only for triangulations .",
    "may the reader forgive us .",
    "first , the description of the active boundary @xmath229 in the percolation exploration process is no longer exactly a random walk killed uppon hitting @xmath234 .",
    "however , it is very closely related to such a process . in particular , as long as @xmath229 is large the increments are i.i.d .",
    "it is easy to see that the increments of this walk have mean @xmath136 exactly at the critical point , that the increments are bounded from above and have heavy - tail of exponent @xmath97 on the left ( even in the case of quadrangulations where there may be two segments swallowed on the right , as in [ fig : peelhalfquad3 ] ) .",
    "in particular these increments are always in the domain of attraction of the @xmath293-stable process with no positive jumps .",
    "obviously , the value of @xmath445 is changed .",
    "concerning [ thm : exacttheta ] , a similar argument holds for some the other percolation models we discussed , but yields a slightly weaker result . indeed , for the other models the associated process @xmath229 has increments that are bounded but not by @xmath11 .",
    "thus the ballot theorem does not give the precise probability of eternal positivity .",
    "still , the probability that a random walk on @xmath81 with steps bounded by @xmath122 with expectation @xmath446 remains positive at all times is between @xmath447 and @xmath448 .",
    "thus the identity of the theorem is replaced by lower and upper bounds differing by a constant . in the case of bond percolation ,",
    "the stopping time of the exploration may not coincide with the first time the active boundary is swallowed but is lower bounded by the preceding and upper bounded by a geometric number of them .",
    "all these modifications clearly do not affect the near - critical exponent so that we still have @xmath449 . since the tail of @xmath359 the stopping time @xmath359 is also going to be the same , the lower bounds of [ thm : criticexpo ] are almost unchanged : on the event @xmath450 there is a high probability that @xmath451 , that @xmath452 and @xmath453 .    for the upper bounds , again most of the estimates still hold .",
    "some additional computations arise since it is possible to have multiple boltzmann maps revealed at a single step , but mostly the arguments hold .",
    "special care is needed for the bound on @xmath65 .",
    "now the processes @xmath294 and @xmath423 are even further from being independent , since it is possible for both of them to make jumps at the same time .",
    "however , it is possible to show that the large jumps in these processes occur at distinct times , and so the joint distribution @xmath454 is that of independent processes .",
    "this allows one to estimate the fluctuations of @xmath423 above its infimum at the killing time @xmath359 of @xmath294 .        , _ the objective method : probabilistic combinatorial optimization and local weak convergence _ , in probability on discrete structures , vol .  110 of encyclopaedia math .",
