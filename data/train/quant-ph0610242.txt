    "in the present paper we calculate the cross sections @xmath2 for formation of ions in interactions of high energy photons with atoms . we calculate also the distribution @xmath3 for the process in which the final state contains an ion and electron with energy @xmath4 .",
    "we consider the high energy asymptotics of these characteristics , i.e. we consider the photon energies @xmath5 with @xmath6 standing for the electron mass at rest(we employ the system of units with @xmath7 ) .",
    "we shall include only the lowest terms of expansion in @xmath8 in our calculations .",
    "the simplest mechanism for formation of ions is the photoionization ( photoeffect ) , in which the final state consists of an ion and a continuum electron .",
    "it is also known that while the energies increase , the compton scattering on the bound electron dominates .",
    "et al _ @xcite noted that at still higher energies ions are produced mainly being accompanied by creation of electron - positron pairs and provided estimates for the corresponding cross section .",
    "here we carry out the calculations for the distributions @xmath3 and for the cross section @xmath2 .",
    "we focus on the case of not very large values of nuclear charge @xmath9 adding , however , an analysis of the case , when @xmath10 is not considered as a small parameter . when unequality ( 2 ) is true , we can separate three scales of the electron kinetic energies @xmath4 .",
    "besides the characteristic values of @xmath11 and @xmath6 , the third one is the electron binding energy @xmath12 . for k - shell in the hydrogenlike approximation @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "we demonstrate that for the energies @xmath15 the distribution @xmath3 is determined by the vacuum assisted mechanism .",
    "the ionized electrons can be distinguished from those of @xmath0 pair since the latter carry mostly energies @xmath16 .",
    "we show how the distribution can be presented in terms of the pair creation on a free electron at rest .",
    "we show also that at these values of the electron energies the distribution does not depend on the details of atomic structure . at @xmath17",
    "the distribution behaves as @xmath18 .",
    "this means that in order to calculate the cross section @xmath2 one has to include the region @xmath19 which should be treated separately .",
    "we show that in the asymptotics ( 1 ) the cross section reaches a constant value and calculate it .    in sec.2 we present general equations . in sec.3",
    "we calculate distribution @xmath3 for @xmath20 . in sec.4",
    "we calculate this distribution for @xmath21 . in sec.5",
    "we carry out a matching of the energy distributions in the two regions . in sec.6",
    "we calculate the cross section of ion production @xmath2 and compare the results of our calculations with experimental data .",
    "we summarize in sec.7 .",
    "in all the processes considered in the paper an electron is removed from the atom to continuum .",
    "it will be instructive to consider simultaneously a similar process on the free electron at rest .",
    "for the latter case we denote the four - momenta of the electrons as @xmath22 with the time component @xmath23 and @xmath24 . we denote four - momenta of the electron and positron of the created @xmath0 pair as @xmath25 and @xmath26 correspondingly . for each @xmath27",
    "the total energy is @xmath28 , while kinetic energies are @xmath29 .",
    "the four - momentum of the incoming photon is @xmath30 , while for its three - dimension momentum we can write @xmath31 .    in the pair production on the nucleus",
    "the latter accepts linear momentum @xmath32 in the pair production on free electron momentum ( 3 ) is transferred to the latter . in pair production on the bound electron momentum @xmath33 is transferred to the residual ion .",
    "the cross section for pair creation in the field of the nucleus was first calculated by bethe and heitler @xmath34 .",
    "it can be represented as @xmath35 with the phase volume @xmath36 .    at @xmath37",
    "it is convenient to present momenta @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) as @xmath40 with the axis @xmath41 directed along photon momentum @xmath42 . the lower index @xmath43 denotes the components , which are orthogonal to @xmath42 .",
    "the energy distributions are determined by small @xmath44 ( @xmath39 ) @xcite , @xcite with @xmath45 being determined by eq.(3 ) . thus presenting @xmath46 we find that the longitudinal component of the recoil momentum @xmath47 is @xmath48 times smaller than the transverse one .",
    "hence we can write @xmath49    for the pair creation in the field of the bound electron the cross section is @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the amplitude of the process , while @xmath52 , @xmath12 stands for the ionization potential of the bound state .    to avoid writing complicated expressions which describe the third order amplitudes @xmath53 and @xmath51 we present them by the feynman diagrams , following @xcite .",
    "the pair creation in the field of the nucleus is shown by the diagrams of fig .  1 .",
    "the pair creation on the bound electron is shown by the diagrams of fig .",
    "the possible permutations of the final state electrons should be added .",
    "the diagram @xmath54 of fig .",
    "2 shows creation of pairs by the photon with further scattering on the bound electron . in the diagram @xmath55 of fig .",
    "2 the photon is initially absorbed by the bound electron with further radiation of a photon which creates the electron - positron pair .",
    "we consider the case of fast ionized electrons with the energies @xmath56 with @xmath57 being ionization potential of the k shell electron .",
    "we focus on the energies @xmath58 , since the these values provide the leading contribution to the cross section .    the electrons with the energies",
    "@xmath58 can come from @xmath0 pairs and also can be caused by removing of the bound electrons to continuum . in the former case the distribution @xmath3 drops as @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we shall see that in the latter case it does not depend on @xmath11 .",
    "thus the electrons with energies @xmath58 are mainly those which are knocked out from the atom .",
    "momentum @xmath59 should be transferred to residual ion .",
    "it can be transferred by the initial state bound electron or by final state continuum lepton ( electron or positron ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that each interaction of the continuum electron with residual ion provides a factor @xmath60 . on the other hand , in the bound state wave function momentum @xmath59",
    "is compared to the bound state characteristic momentum @xmath61 .",
    "the wave function reaches its largest values at @xmath62 , being strongly quenched at @xmath63 .",
    "thus in the amplitude @xmath64 ( with @xmath38 denoting momenta of the outgoing electrons and that of positron ) we can neglect @xmath59 everywhere except the bound state wave function .",
    "this enables to tie the amplitude of the process on the bound electron with that on the free electron @xmath65 , known as triplet production .",
    "such interpretation of the processes on the bound electrons reflects the ideas of bethe @xcite ( see also analysis presented in @xcite ) .    assuming that the bound electron is described by a single - particle wave function @xmath66 we can write for the amplitude of the pair creation on the bound electron @xmath67    here @xmath68 is the fourier transform of the wave function @xmath66 also referred to as the wave function in momentum space . to simplify notations",
    "we shall omit the lower index @xmath51 further .",
    "note that the outgoing electrons can be described by plane waves due to small value @xmath69 of momentum transferred to the nucleus .",
    "in other words , this is due to existence of kinematical region , where similar process on a free electron could take place .",
    "for example , there is no such kinematical region for the photoeffect , and the plane wave description for relativistic energies is not sufficient @xcite .",
    "see more recent discussion in @xcite .",
    "replacing @xmath70 by @xmath71 in the phase volume we find for the cross section @xmath72 neglecting @xmath12 with respect to @xmath6 and @xmath11 we find @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the cross section of the process on free electron .",
    "after integration over @xmath59 providing @xmath75 ( normalization condition ) we find the distributions @xmath76 to be equal to those of the process on the free electron .",
    "the triplet production was much studied @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , that in the considered region the diagrams of fig.2b as well as the exchange diagrams of fig.2a can be neglected . analytical expression for the differential distribution integrated over the variables of the @xmath0 pair",
    "was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the leading term of expansion in powers of @xmath8 for the distribution of the ionized electron can be written as @xmath77 here @xmath78 , it can be expressed in terms of variables of the ionized electron as @xmath79 ; @xmath80 , @xmath81 stands for the number of the bound electrons in the atom . evaluating eq.(2.4 ) of @xcite we find @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 here @xmath85^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath86 .    since the variable @xmath87 can be viewed as the squared energy of @xmath0 pair in their c.m .",
    "frame , we can write the limitation @xmath88 . the upper limit is @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the energy distribution can be obtained by integration of the differential cross section ( 15 ) over @xmath87 in these limits .",
    "the value is determined by the lower limit of @xmath87 , providing @xmath90 with @xmath91 , and ( the lower index @xmath92 comes from `` fast '' ) @xmath93,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath94 .",
    "the function @xmath95 is shown in fig .",
    "3 . at @xmath96",
    "we find @xmath97 note that eq.(19 ) is not true for @xmath98 .",
    "using eq.(6 ) one can see that momentum transferred to the residual ion can not be made as small as @xmath69 if all the three final state leptons carry the energies @xmath99 .",
    "thus eq ( 19 ) is true for @xmath100 . since for @xmath101",
    "the distribution behaves as @xmath102 , the region @xmath103 provides a contribution of the same order of magnitude to the total cross section .",
    "now we consider the case @xmath104 . in this case",
    "the outgoing electron carries momentum @xmath105 of the order of the binding momentum @xmath106 .",
    "thus momentum @xmath59 transferred to residual ion can be as small as @xmath61 only if momentum @xmath45 transferred to the atom is also of the order of @xmath107 .",
    "hence the amplitude of the ionization shown in fig .",
    "2a can be written as @xmath108 with @xmath109 here @xmath110 is the wave function of the outgoing electron with asymptotical momentum @xmath111 , @xmath55 denotes the state of the bound electron . since @xmath112",
    ", the interactions between the outgoing electron and the residual ion can not be treated perturbativly .",
    "thus we can write @xmath113 the bethe - heitler distribution @xmath114 with @xcite @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( here we denoted @xmath117 , @xmath118 ) should be evaluated for @xmath44 , as in bethe - heitler case , but now we need also @xmath119 this means that @xmath120 and @xmath121 . introducing variables @xmath45 and @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) instead of @xmath124 and @xmath125 we can present eq.(25 ) in the form @xmath126 with @xmath127 while the phase volume in eq.(23 ) becomes @xmath128 after integration over the positron variables and over @xmath43 we find @xmath129 the factors @xmath130 turn to zero at @xmath131 due to orthogonality of the wave functions involved . thus @xmath130 contains @xmath45 as a factor at @xmath132 , and the integral over @xmath45 on the right hand side ( rhs ) of eq.(29 ) provides a finite value .    the factors @xmath130 have been computed for many cases in connection with electron - atom scattering .",
    "here we present calculations with nonrelativistic coulomb functions .",
    "we shall provide results for k shell electrons .",
    "thus the further results of this section are actually true for the ground states of relatively light ( eq.(2 ) ) single - electron ions .",
    "straightforward calculations provide @xmath133}{a^4|b|^2}.\\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the averaged momentum of the k electron , @xmath134 is the sommerfeld parameter of interaction between the outgoing electron and the nucleus .",
    "the other notations in eq.(30 ) are @xmath135 , @xmath136 while @xmath137 .",
    "the factor @xmath138 is the squared normalization factor of the outgoing electron wave function .    presenting the phase volume of the outgoing electron as @xmath139",
    ", we can carry out integration over the solid angle @xmath140 @xmath141 here @xmath142 , @xmath143 ^ 3 $ ] . combining eqs.(29 ) and ( 33 ) , we can write @xmath144    introducing @xmath145 we find @xmath146 with @xmath147 with @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .    thus the energy distribution can be presented as @xmath151 ( the lower index @xmath152 comes from `` slow '' ) with @xmath153 being the k - electron binding energy , and @xmath154 the function @xmath155 is shown in fig .  4 .    since @xmath156 at @xmath157 ( see eq.(32 ) ) , we find a nonzero value for @xmath158 using eq.(32 ) one can present eq.(37 ) also as @xmath159    at @xmath160 eq.(31 ) provides @xmath161 , and thus @xmath162 .",
    "the lowest order of expansion in powers of @xmath163 , corresponding to the plane wave description of the outgoing electron leads to @xmath164 thus for @xmath165 @xmath166 in agreement with nonrelativistic limit @xmath101 of eq.(18 ) ( see eq.(20 ) ) .",
    "we see that the lowest order expansion in powers of @xmath163 of the rhs of eq.(37 ) leads to the same result as provided by nonrelativistic limit of eq.(18 ) . on the other hand",
    "the function @xmath167 depends on @xmath163 in terms of parameters @xmath168 , containing also explicit dependence on the parameter @xmath169 .",
    "the latter thus include the terms which are linear in @xmath163 , containing also numerically large coefficient .",
    "we show , however that in our case dependence on @xmath169 cancels out at least in the lowest order terms of @xmath170 expansion .    on the rhs of eq.(37 ) dependence on @xmath169",
    "is contained explicitly in normalization factor @xmath171 determined by eq.(32 ) .",
    "such dependence comes also from the exponential factor of the integrand of @xmath172 determined by eq.(41 ) . since @xmath173 ( we denoted @xmath174 ) is dominated by @xmath175 we can replace it by @xmath176 making the relative error of the order @xmath177 . since @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) while for any @xmath180 @xmath181 we can write @xmath182 integral ( 47 ) can be evaluated analytically @xmath183 using eq.(31 ) we find that the total dependence of the energy distribution on parameter @xmath169 cancels out .",
    "the limiting eq.(42 ) for @xmath184 can be written as @xmath185 being more rigorous we should replace @xmath186 by @xmath187 .",
    "thus several next to leading order corrections to the high energy limit of the function @xmath155 can be included by a simple factor @xmath188 as one can see from fig.4b the function @xmath189 approximates the function ( 39 ) well enough even at @xmath190 close to zero .",
    "the largest relative deviation between the rhs of eqs.(39 ) and ( 51 ) takes place at @xmath191 , being about @xmath192 .",
    "the function @xmath193 determined by eq.(19 ) describes the energy distribution at @xmath160 and does not include corrections of the order @xmath194 . on the other hand the function @xmath195 ( 39 ) describes the energy distribution at @xmath101 since the outgoing electron is treated nonrelativistically .",
    "one should investigate the functions @xmath193 and @xmath195 in the energy region @xmath196 where both equations describe the energy distribution , i.e. in the region where corrections to both distributions are expexted to be small .",
    "the actual analysis show that such region exists . in fig.5",
    "we show the functions @xmath197 for characteristic value @xmath198 .",
    "the two descriptions overlap for the energies @xmath199 between 0.1 and 0.2 , i.e. for the energies @xmath200 ( @xmath201 for @xmath198 ) .    taking into account the coulomb corrections to the wave function of the outgoing electron in the distribution",
    "@xmath193 one can expand the consistency of the two descriptions to lower energy values .",
    "as we saw in previous section , the lowest order coulomb corrections can be taken into account by the factor @xmath202 given by eq.(50 ) , i.e by changing @xmath95 to @xmath203 the function @xmath204 is also shown in fig .",
    "now we calculate the total cross section . following the analysis of the previous section we present @xmath205 with the two terms on the rhs corresponding to slow and fast ionized electrons @xmath206 with @xmath207 belonging to the interval determined by eq.(52 ) . since @xmath95 drops as @xmath208 at @xmath209-(eq.(19 ) )",
    ", the contribution @xmath210 has a finite value at @xmath211 . using eqs.(18 ) and",
    "( 42 ) we find @xmath212 the contributions @xmath213 and @xmath214 come from the regions @xmath103 and @xmath215 correspondingly .",
    "thus the total cross section can be written as @xmath216 with @xmath217 . in this approach @xmath218",
    "can exhibit a weak dependence on @xmath219 .",
    "note that the low energy contribution to @xmath213 can be calculated as @xmath220 with the functions @xmath195 and @xmath221 being determined by eqs.(39 ) and ( 51 ) .",
    "the integral is saturated by @xmath222 , providing the value @xmath223 .",
    "the presentation ( 57 ) for the cross section can be obtained by noting that the function ( 53 ) approximates the energy distribution well enough .",
    "the largest deviations from the exact curve are of the order of several percent , taking place at @xmath224 . using eq.(20 )",
    "we find that @xmath225 at @xmath101 , providing a logarithmic term on the rhs of eq.(57 ) .",
    "since at @xmath103 we can put @xmath226 , the parameter @xmath213 is determined by eq.(58 ) .",
    "the actual numerical calculations employing the function @xmath227 provide values of @xmath218 changing from 1.23 for @xmath228 to 1.31 for @xmath229 . note that the integral over large energies converges slowly due to a rather slow drop of the function @xmath95 ( eq.(19 ) ) .",
    "for the characteristic value @xmath198 we obtain @xmath230 , putting @xmath231 as the upper limit of the second integral on the rhs of eq.(55 ) . however assuming the upper limits of integration to be @xmath232 or @xmath233 we find values of @xmath214 to be 0.67 and 0.91 correspondingly .    for the ground state of a not very heavy ( eq.(2 ) ) single - electron ion",
    "we have @xmath153 and eq.(57 ) can be written as @xmath234    if the parameter @xmath10 is not treated as a small one , one should use relativistic coulomb functions for all the electrons and positron .",
    "it is known @xcite that the ultrarelativistic particles of the @xmath0 pair can be described by furry - sommerfeld - maue ( fsm ) functions @xcite which provide a relative accuracy @xmath235 with @xmath236 standing for the orbital momenta . since the pair transfers momentum @xmath237 to the nucleus or to the outgoing electron the values of @xmath238 are important .",
    "thus corrections to fsm functions can be neglected .",
    "the calculation for the pair creation in the field of the nucleus @xcite resulted in an additional contribution @xmath239 to the cross section , which does not depend on the photon energy , and can be presented as @xmath10 series . in our process",
    "the ultrarelativistic particles of the pair can be considered in similar way , providing the same contribution @xmath239 to the cross section .",
    "however the bound electron and the ionized electron at @xmath215 should be described by totally relativistic coulomb functions at @xmath240 .",
    "one can employ the presentation @xcite in which relativistic functions are expressed in terms of @xmath10 series with the fsm functions as zero order terms .",
    "hence in the case @xmath240 the cross section can be written as @xmath241 with @xmath242 , while @xmath243 can be presented as a certain @xmath10 series .",
    "until now we considered a single electron ion . turning to the case of an atom containing @xmath219 electrons or of an ion containing @xmath81 electrons",
    "one can see that for any bound electron the structure of the cross section is similar to that for the single - electron case .",
    "the contribution @xmath214 caused by large energies @xmath215 is the same for all the electrons .",
    "we saw the contribution @xmath213 to be numerically small for k electrons .",
    "since the other electrons are less bound , it is still smaller for them and can be neglected .",
    "thus we can write for a bound electron state with the binding energy @xmath12 , @xmath244 with @xmath245 , @xmath246 is the number of electrons in the state @xmath55 .",
    "note that we omitted all contributions , which drop with @xmath11 .",
    "the largest neglected terms are of the order @xmath247 , which are much smaller then unity for @xmath248 .",
    "this condition is stronger then ( 1 ) .",
    "however , in the case @xmath249 we can still use eqs.(59)-(61 ) in logarithmic approximation due to the large value of @xmath250 .",
    "note that our cross section reaches a constant value at @xmath211 . on the other hand the cross section of pair creation in the field of the nucleus @xcite and that on a free electron @xcite increase as @xmath251 in this limit .",
    "this happens because the logarithmic terms are caused by integration over momentum transferred @xmath45 in the former case and over the momentum of outgoing electron @xmath105 in the latter case . in both cases",
    "the lower limits of integration are of the order @xmath252 , causing the terms @xmath253 in the cross sections . in our case",
    "the effects of the binding are important at the lower limits and we obtain @xmath254 instead .    in @xcite ionization of internal shells of silver and gold atoms in coincidence with pair creation",
    "was measured for 1 gev photons .",
    "using eq.(61 ) we find the cross sections for ionization of the k shells to be @xmath255 in ag and @xmath256 in au . in the latter case @xmath257 and the errors",
    "can be about @xmath258 .",
    "the experimental results are @xmath259 for ag and @xmath260 for au .",
    "our result for ionization of the l - shell in au is @xmath261 , while the experiment provides @xmath262 .",
    "thus our calculations underestimate the experimental data for silver , being in agreement with the results for gold .",
    "now we find the values of the photon energy @xmath11 for which the considered process is the main mechanism of formation ions .",
    "we must compare the cross section of our process to the asymptotics of photoionization and to that of the compton scattering on the bound electrons . for small and moderate values of @xmath219",
    "the cross section of the latter process is larger than that of the former one at @xmath37 .",
    "the total cross section of the high energy compton scattering on a bound electron is equal to that on a free electron @xcite .",
    "the asymptotics of the latter is @xmath263 with @xmath264 .",
    "thus @xmath265 drops while the photon energy increases . at certain value",
    "@xmath1 @xmath266 and @xmath267 for @xmath268 . in fig 6 .",
    "we show the @xmath219 dependence of @xmath1 for the k electrons of single electron ions and of atoms .",
    "the value for hydrogen @xmath269 is the smallest one . for the external electrons the values of @xmath1",
    "become still smaller due to the small values of the binding energies . for example the binding energies of @xmath270 and @xmath271 electrons in na and k are @xmath272 and @xmath273 correspondingly @xcite , providing the values @xmath274 and @xmath275 .",
    "we analysed formation of ions by high energy photons accompanied by creation of @xmath0 pairs .",
    "we calculated the energy distributions @xmath276 for creation of an ion and a continuum electron with kinetic energy @xmath277 .",
    "we showed that the slow electrons with @xmath4 being of the order of the binding energies @xmath12 and the fast electrons with the energies @xmath278 need a separate treatment .",
    "we carried out matching of the two regions and found analytical formula ( 53 ) , which approximates the whole spectrum of the outgoing electrons .",
    "we integrated the energy distributions and found the expressions ( 59 ) and ( 61 ) describing the cross sections for the ionization of single - electron ions and of any state in a many - electron atom .",
    "we showed that the high energy asymptotics of the cross sections does not depend on the photon energy .",
    "we found the values of the photon energies @xmath1 for which ionization accompanied by pair creation becomes to be the dominant mechanism for the formation of an ion .",
    "the @xmath219-dependence of @xmath1 for k electrons is shown in fig .",
    "the value of @xmath1 appeared to be about @xmath279 in hydrogen , increasing with @xmath219 , and being somewhat smaller for loosely bound external electrons of heavier atoms .",
    "note that related problem of the influence of atomic electrons on the pair creation was considered in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the authors focused on modification of characteristics of the created pair by the atomic field .",
    "that is why they used some additional approximations in the description of atomic electrons .",
    "however , the totally integrated cross section which includes all inelastic transitions , presented in @xcite for the case of hydrogen ( @xmath280 ) , can be compared with our result @xmath281 .",
    "as far as we know the only related experiment was carried out in @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with these data .",
    "there are still large errors in experimental and theoretical analysis .",
