    "stellar compact objects like a black hole , neutron star or white dwarf in the cusp surrounding the massive black hole ( mbh ) in the galactic nuclei could be deployed on a very eccentric orbit due to n - body interaction .",
    "such an object could either plunge ( directly or after few orbits ) into mbh or form an emri : inspiralling compact object on originally very eccentric orbit which shrinks and circularizes due to loss of the energy and angular orbital momentum through gravitational radiation .",
    "the compact object spends @xmath0 orbits in the very strong field of a mbh before it plunges , all this orbital evolution will be encoded in the phase of emitted gravitational waves ( gws ) .",
    "space based gw observatories , like lisa or similar planned missions , will observe those sources few years before the plunge . by fitting precisely the gw phase",
    "one can extract extremely accurate parameters of a binary system @xcite ( like mass and spin of mbh @xmath1 , mass of a small object @xmath2 , inclination of the orbital plane ( to the spin of mbh ) , orbital eccentricity and semi - latus rectum ( @xmath3 ) at some fiducial moment of time @xmath4 , location of the source on the sky ( @xmath5 ) and more ) .",
    "precise tracking of the gw phase implies that we can also test the nature of the central massive object .",
    "the general belief is that it should be a mbh with surrounding spacetime described by a kerr solution .",
    "the nature of the spacetime affects the orbital evolution of the compact object which in turn could be extracted from the gw phase .",
    "kerr spacetime is described by only two parameters : black hole s mass and spin , as stated by a `` no - hair '' theorem .",
    "the spacetime could be decomposed in the multipole moments of a central massive object , and , for kerr",
    "bh , all moments depend only on @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are mass and current moments .",
    "we could measure three first moments ( mass , spin and quadrupole moment)@xcite , and check the `` kerrness '' of a spacetime .",
    "in general , the deviations from kerr could come in several ways : ( i ) it is kerr bh but there is an additional perturber ( gas disk , another mbh ) ( ii ) it is not kerr bh but some other object satisfying gr ( boson star , gravastar ) , ( iii ) there are deviations from gr . for discussion on the topics we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein .",
    "modeling orbital evolution even within gr is not yet fully complete .",
    "large mass ratio allows us to consider a small compact object as a perturbation on the kerr background spacetime , and treat the problem perturbatively in orders of the mass ratio . in zero order approximation",
    "the compact object moves on a geodesic orbit , however , as soon as we assign the mass to it , it creates its own gravitational field interacting with the background and this system emits gravitational radiation .",
    "the force resulting from the interaction of the self field with the background is called self force , and the motion of the compact object could be seen as the forced geodesic motion .",
    "alternative interpretation is that the motion is governed by a geodesic motion but in the perturbed spacetime .",
    "calculation of the self force is a complicated task which is accomplished for the orbits around schwarzschild bh only @xcite , the kerr spacetime is underway .",
    "there are also questions concerning the calculation of the orbital evolution under the self force : the self force depends on the past history of the compact object ( which is usually assumed to be a geodesic in the background spacetime ) . to compute the motion under the self force one can use the osculating elements approach @xcite , or self - consistent approach of direct integration of the regularized equations @xcite . for more details on this subject",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "all in all , the modeling of the orbital evolution and the gw signal is a complex task which requires significant theoretical and computational developments .",
    "the latter prevents us currently from using the state - of - art gw models of emris in our data analysis explorations . in majority of the cases",
    "the phenomenological model suggested in @xcite , so called `` analytic kludge '' ( ak ) , is used .",
    "it is based on post - newtonian expressions and puts together all relevant physics of emris .",
    "however , this model has restrictions in the number of harmonics and in their strength , and any search algorithm which relies on its specific harmonic content will not work for a more realistic model of gw signal .",
    "the main motivation of this work is to create the phenomenological search template family which would fit a very large range of emri - like signals .",
    "the typical emri signal consists of a set of harmonics of three ( slowly evolving ) orbital frequencies , and we will use it as a basis of our template .",
    "the phenomenological template consists of @xmath11 harmonics with constant amplitude and slowly evolving phase which we decompose in a taylor series .",
    "truncation of the taylor series and the assumption about constant amplitude set restrictions on the duration over which the phenomenological template can fit an emri signal .",
    "the amplitude of emri s harmonics changes due to shrinking of the orbit ( overall amplitude increases ) , circularization of the orbit ( power is shifted to lower harmonics ) and slight change in the inclination of the orbit to the spin of mbh .",
    "using more terms in the taylor series helps to track phase of the emri signal for longer time ( which is more important than accurate description of the amplitude ) . finally , we decide on the number of harmonics to use in the template ( and their indices ) based on the analysis of the harmonic structure of the numerical kludge ( nk ) model @xcite of emri in different parts of the parameter space",
    "the restriction that the phenomenological waveform ( pw ) is valid only for a limited period of time is very weak since we can fit the signal piecewise , as long as the accumulated signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) over that time is significant to claim presence of the signal . in this work we consider only those parts of the emri signal where the orbital frequencies are not decreasing which is true over almost all time of the inspiral and breaks quite close to the plunge .",
    "however , this is not really necessary since we did not restrict the values of frequency derivatives to positive values during the search .",
    "the pw family is quite generic and does not depend on the orbital evolution , or , in other words , the orbital evolution of the binary is encoded in the taylor coefficients of phase of each harmonic .",
    "this allows us to detect an emri signal in a model independent way .",
    "once the harmonics of the signal are recovered we can analyze them using a specific emri model to recover physical parameters of the system .",
    "it is at this point we need the orbital evolution with high accuracy , which involves computation of the self - force and tests of possible deviations from the `` kerrness '' .    after constructing the phenomenological waveform we perform blind searches on the simulated data without noise ( to avoid stochastic errors in the parameter estimation ) and with the noise .",
    "we have used the nk waveform ( as described in @xcite ) as a model of our signal and the orbital evolution according to @xcite .",
    "we have also used markov chain monte - carlo ( mcmc ) search with phenomenological waveforms on the simulated three month of data .",
    "this search has provided us with multiple local maxima in the likelihood which we gathered and analyzed in a similar way as described in @xcite .",
    "we associate local maxima in the likelihood with partial detections of the signal and construct the time - frequency map of the detected ( patchy ) harmonics of the source .",
    "the next step is to assume the model for the orbital evolution and , by matching the found time - frequency tracks to the harmonics of the signal , estimate parameters of the binary system .",
    "we have used the same model for the orbital evolution as in the simulated data sets and recovered physical parameters with precision better than few percent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will give a brief overview of available models for gws from emris .",
    "in section  [ s : pw ] , we introduce pw family in details .",
    "we describe mcmc search with pws in section  [ s : mcmc ] .",
    "analysis of mcmc results and mapping to the physical parameters are done in the section  [ s : pso ] .",
    "finally we conclude with a summary section  [ s : summary ] .",
    "as was already mentioned in the introduction , accurate computation of the gws from emris and the orbital evolution is a complex and computationally intensive task .",
    "the most promising approach probably is the coupled integration of the compact object dynamics and gw emission taken in @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could have a separate evolution of the orbital motion using self force computed across various geodesic orbits and employ osculating elements approach @xcite .",
    "the waveform at infinity could be obtained from the teukolsky equations @xcite in time or in frequency domain @xcite .",
    "the above methods are computationally expensive and several approximations were suggested .",
    "less accurate but still quite reliable are numerical kludge ( nk ) waveforms : original nk @xcite and extended / improved nk called `` chimera '' @xcite .",
    "those methods combine accurate prescription for the orbital evolution with approximate ( post - newtonian ) waveform generation formalism .",
    "the less precise model , which captures all relevant physics of emris ( orbital precession , three orbital frequencies ) was suggested in @xcite , so called analytic kludge waveform .",
    "these waveforms are very fast to generate , and even though they can not be used for searching for actual gw signals , they are used to develop data analysis algorithms and to evaluate their performance @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we used nk waveform . in the original paper , @xcite ,",
    "the waveform was generated in the time domain , we have reimplemented it in the frequency domain following suggestions of s. drasco who did it first ( private communications ) .",
    "however , we still take into account the time dependence of only three orbital constants under radiation reaction : energy , azimuthal component of the orbital angular momentum and carter constant . under the self force in osculating element approach",
    "we should evolve also other three constants ( defining initial position of the compact object ) due to conservative part of the self - force @xcite .",
    "this does not affect our search results , since pw is model independent , however , we have to use the same model ( as in the simulated data ) for mapping the phenomenological parameters onto the physical parameters of the binary .",
    "mismatch in the models would result in the bias which we want to avoid .",
    "finally we want to avoid using in this work the analytic kludge model , because it predicts somewhat simplified ( detectable ) harmonic content of the waveform .",
    "the nk waveforms for generic orbits were compared against waveforms based on the teukolsky equation and they show quite good agreement .",
    "we believe that nk deviates from the true emri signal in the phase but not so much in the number and strength of harmonics .",
    "therefore we use nk model as a representation of the emri signal throughout this paper .",
    "there are several algorithms which have been proven to be successful in detecting emris in the simulated lisa data @xcite",
    ". however , those algorithms partially utilize the features of ak waveform which was used in the simulation of the data and in the data analysis .",
    "as explained in section  [ s : rew ] , we want to avoid it by building a generic phenomenological template family .",
    "the model we want to propose is based on the following assumptions about gw signals from emris :    1 .",
    "the orbital motion can be effectively described by six slowly changing quantities .",
    "explicitly , three time - dependent initial phases are governed by the conservative part of the self force ; three fundamental time - dependent frequencies are governed by the radiative part of the self force .",
    "the waveform is represented by harmonics of three frequencies ( phenomenologically , these frequencies are the summation of the fundamental orbital frequencies and the evolution of the initial phases ) with slowly changing intrinsic amplitude :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 are the phase evolutions corresponding to the three fundamental motions . here",
    "we omitted the tensorial spatial indices for simplicity .",
    "the first assumption basically expresses that the motion is described by a slow drift from one geodesic to another .",
    "the initial phases correspond to the initial position of a compact object on a given geodesic and the orbital frequencies are functions of the energy , azimuthal component of the orbital momentum and carter constant .",
    "the slow drift ensures that phases @xmath14 are slowly varying functions of time .",
    "[ fig : tf_plot1 ] shows the time - frequency plot of a typical emri signal.there are 30 clearly separated frequency tracks in the noiseless plot , which display the dominant harmonics .",
    "it can also be seen that the frequencies of harmonics are smooth and vary slowly .     the time - frequency plot of a typical emri signal without noise .",
    "there are 30 dominant harmonics in total.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    it is generally true that both amplitude and the phase are slowly varying functions of time , thus we can safely make the taylor expansion : @xmath15 since the amplitudes @xmath16 are even smoother than the phase over extended period of time , and because the detection techniques are more sensitive to mismatch in the phase than in the amplitude , we can neglect the time evolution in the amplitudes and treat all of them as constant .",
    "it is a very good assumption over three months of the simulated data which we analyze in this paper . as for the phase expansion",
    ", we calculate the so - called fitting factor ( ff ) for the different orders of polynomial approximations of the phase to check the fidelity of the pw .",
    "numerical results show that the taylor expansion for three months data , up to @xmath17 order , gives the ff around @xmath18 , and up to @xmath19 order the ff is larger than @xmath20 .",
    "so it is sufficient to expand the phase to @xmath19 order .",
    "this is the phenomenological waveform family which we propose to analyze an emri signal .",
    "to summarize , the phenomenological waveform is a summation of individual harmonics with constant ( or linear ) amplitudes and polynomial ( in time ) phases .",
    "first we will express the gw wavefrom in the solar system barycenter frame and then translate it to the frame attached to lisa ( or a lisa - like space based observatory ) . in the source frame ,",
    "an arbitrary gravitational wave  ( gw ) signal in the tt gauge can be written in the following form : @xmath21 where the superscript s denotes the source frame . since the lisa constellation is orbiting the sun , it is convenient to express the gw signal in the solar system barycenter ( ssb ) frame .",
    "@xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the direction of the gw source in the ssb frame , @xmath24 are the unit vectors along longitudinal and latitudinal directions .",
    "the principal polarization vectors attached to the solar system barycenter frame , @xmath24 are connected to the principal polarization vectors in the source frame via rotation angle @xmath25 ( since they lie in the same plane orthogonal to the gw propagation direction ) .",
    "the polarization components @xmath26 and @xmath27 are transformed under this rotation according to @xmath28    now we will add lisa response .",
    "lisa measures the doppler shift of the inter - spacecraft lasers induced by a gravitational wave .",
    "the single - link full response to this frequency shift can be derived with the help of three killing vectors  @xcite . however , this single - link signal is orders of magnitude smaller than the dominating laser frequency noise .",
    "thus , we need to use the so - called time - delay - interferometry ( tdi ) variables  @xcite , which cancel the laser noise through the recombination of the artificially delayed single - link signals . in the low frequency limit ,",
    "the two orthogonal tdi ( noise independent ) variables of michelson type can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath29/l \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\mathbf{h}(\\zeta):\\bm{d}_i \\\\",

    "we assume lisa - like setup which has six links ( three arms ) .",
    "even though the emri signal could reach quite high frequencies and require full response , we adopt the low - frequency approximation for our exercises .",
    "this does not restrict ability of our analysis as long as the simulated signal and the search template use the same response function .",

    "this is the quantity we want to maximize over the parameter set @xmath47 .",
    "the likelihood ratio could be further simplified if we use pw .",
    "a single harmonic with polynomial phase up to @xmath19 order in the source frame takes the following form @xmath53 where we have omitted harmonic indices @xmath54 . after simple algebra ,",
    "lisa s response to this single harmonic gw signal without noise can be put in a simple form @xmath55 where we follow summation convention over repeated indices , and @xmath56 .",

    "the extrinsic parameters ( being constants in our approximation ) can be maximized over analytically  @xcite , which we will show explicitly below .",
    "we denote the measured data with noise corresponding to @xmath61 by @xmath62 .",
    "since the joint probability of a gw signal present in both @xmath63 and @xmath64 is just the product of the individual probabilities , the joint log likelihood is just the summation of the individual log likelihoods @xmath65 substituting ( [ e : dec ] ) into this expression we arrive at @xmath66 where we have used the following conventions : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",

    "here we defined @xmath99 as a set of parameters at step @xmath100 , which can also be viewed as a point in the parameter space @xmath97 .",
