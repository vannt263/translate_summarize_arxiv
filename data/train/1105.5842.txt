    "an enigmatic prediction of einstein s general theory of relativity are gravitational waves ( gw ) . with the observed decay in the orbit of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar agreeing within a fraction of a percent with the theoretically computed decay from einstein s theory ,",
    "the existence of gw was firmly established .",
    "currently there is a worldwide effort to detect gw with the operating interferometric gravitational wave observatories , the ligo , virgo , geo and tama @xcite . now",
    "the advanced detectors being constructed include the upgraded ligo and virgo , the lcgt of japan , ligo - australia and future possibilities such as einstein telescope ( et ) @xcite .",
    "different types of gw sources have been predicted and may be directly observed by these advanced detectors in the near future ( see  @xcite and references therein for recent reviews ) . in this paper",
    "we will address the problem of the targeted search of stochastic gw from a small region in the sky , typically of linear size of a few degrees ( few pixels - a pixel determined by the diffraction limit ) - a `` hot spot '' - where there is likely to be an abundance of independent , unresolved gw sources continuously producing a relatively large stochastic background .",
    "such a scenario seems feasible for the virgo cluster , which could contain about @xmath1 neutron stars , the current estimate being @xmath2 per galaxy . out of these neutron stars a small fraction of them",
    "could be rotating sufficiently rapidly emitting gw in the advanced detector bandwidth of several 100 hz to about 1 khz .",
    "these could produce a reasonable signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) with an integration time of the order of an year .",
    "thus , the gw source consists of spinning asymmetric neutron stars whose amplitudes and phases are randomly distributed",
    ". we will be thus dealing with a localized stochastic gw source .",
    "this is only one type of gw source , but there could be contributions from other sources such as supernovae with asymmetric core collapse , binary black hole mergers , low - mass x - ray binaries and hydrodynamical instabilities in neutron stars , or even gws from astrophysical objects that we never knew existed .",
    "these will only in general ( statistically ) add to the snr .",
    "the detectors we consider for this paper are advanced detectors such as the ligo , virgo , lcgt , et etc . which are expected to have sufficient sensitivity for detecting a hot spot .",
    "the appropriate method for observing such a source is the cross - correlation method described in @xcite ( henceforth referred to as paper i ) , which is also generally known as the radiometric method .",
    "the idea is to cross - correlate data streams from two detectors with an appropriate time - delay , namely , the time - delay between arrival times of a gw wavefront from a specific direction @xmath3 .",
    "this choice of time - delay allows the sampling of the same wavefront . as the detector baseline rotates with the earth , the time - delay between the data streams changes during the course of the day .",
    "the statistic targets a patch ( pixel ) in the sky around @xmath3 its size being determined by the diffraction limit , namely , the inverse of the band - width divided by the light travel time along the baseline .",
    "this statistic in fact is a point estimate of the signal received from the given direction @xmath3 and is most appropriate for observing a hot spot and could be made optimal by ` masking ' the rest of the sky if the hot spot emits a strong signal .",
    "the gw strain amplitude for a rotating neutron star is proportional to the square of the frequency @xcite , h ~4",
    "^2 f^2 , where @xmath4 is the orientation factor , @xmath5 is the newton s gravitational constant , @xmath6 the speed of light , @xmath7 is the ellipticity of the neutron star , @xmath8 the moment of inertia , @xmath9 the distance to the source and @xmath10 the gw frequency .",
    "since the cross - correlation statistic is quadratic in the strain amplitude , it scales as the fourth power of the frequency and therefore the main contribution to the snr will tend to come from high frequency sources assuming that they are relatively abundant in the high frequency regime . thus it is the population of millisecond neutron stars that we must primarily consider .",
    "we then estimate the millisecond neutron star population from the astrophysical information that is available and show that one can get an acceptable snr , @xmath11 , for an integration of time of about an year .",
    "using multiple baselines improves the snr further .",
    "we find that among the current or near future baselines , the baseline of the two ligos and the baseline of ligo livingston and a ligo like detector at aigo site stand out - they give dominant contribution to the snr .",
    "in section [ stat ] , we give a brief description of the cross - correlation method and the statistic and then derive an expression for the optimal snr . in section [ r&d",
    "] , we state our results and discuss them in light of the astrophysical scenarios that are possible and the sensitivities of the future advanced detectors such as the et .",
    "we refer to paper i for the detailed arguments involved in defining the cross - correlation statistic . here",
    "we only furnish the salient steps .",
    "since here we are interested in observing a hot spot , we will restrict our discussion to a point source .",
    "the full statistic , which we denote by @xmath12 , is a weighted sum of elementary pieces @xmath13 defined over a time - segments @xmath14 which are labeled by @xmath15 .",
    "the full observation time is @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 is so chosen that it is much larger than the possible time - delay between the detectors ( which must be less than about 40 ms for ground - based detectors ) and much less than the time required for the orientation of the detectors to change appreciably and also on the timescale in which the noise is stationary .",
    "current values of @xmath17 used in lsc data analysis vary from 32 to 192 seconds .",
    "let us consider a pair of detectors labeled by @xmath18 , then the data in the @xmath19 detector is given by @xmath20 , the signal @xmath21 is added to the noise @xmath22 in the @xmath19 detector . for a point source in the direction @xmath3 , the @xmath23 also becomes a function of @xmath3 .",
    "it can be expressed easily in the fourier domain , @xmath24 where the @xmath25 are short term fourier transforms ( sft ) defined only over the interval @xmath17 around @xmath26 , namely , @xmath27 the @xmath28 is a filter function chosen so that it optimizes the filter output .",
    "it also depends on the power spectrum of the gw source and the power spectral densities of the noises in each of the detectors .",
    "as discussed in paper i , in the general case it is a far more complicated object - a functional - but for the case of a point source , it reduces to a function of the direction @xmath3 .",
    "even then it remains a functional of the signal power spectral density and the noise power spectral density ( psd ) . with a slight abuse of notation",
    "we still write it as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath23 are random variables because of the noise and for different @xmath15 we take them to be uncorrelated .",
    "the mean and the variance of @xmath23 are denoted respectively by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "it has been shown in paper i that the linear combination that yields the maximum snr is : s & = & , + & = & \\ { _ k=1^n _ k^2 / _ k^2 } ^ , [ snr1 ] where @xmath31 is the snr .",
    "the sum over @xmath15 can be converted into an integral over @xmath32 and henceforth in this article we drop the suffix @xmath15 and replace @xmath26 by just @xmath32 .",
    "this helps to avoid clutter without jeopardizing clarity .",
    "we now turn to the noise and signal psds in terms of which the snr can be finally expressed .",
    "the signal cross - correlation in the two detectors in the limit of large time segment can be written as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the so called directed overlap reduction function analogous to the one defined in @xcite for the full sky , and given in the case of the point source by , ( t , f , ) & = & ( t , )   e^2i f ( t)/c , + ( , t ) & = & f_+1(t , ) f_+2(,t ) + & + & f_1 ( , t ) f_2 ( , t ) , [ gmm ] and where the @xmath35 is the vector joining detector 1 to detector 2 and rotates with the earth tracing out a cone .",
    "the @xmath36 , are the antenna pattern functions for the two detectors and for the two polarizations .",
    "as mentioned in paper i the directed overlap reduction function has a bandwidth of about 750 hz as compared to the few tens of hz for the overlap reduction function found by integrating over the full sky .",
    "this is the main advantage of this method in which the sensitive region of the detector bandwidth is sampled by the statistic .",
    "further the quantity @xmath37 is essentially the flux per unit frequency per unit solid angle . for the noise , we take the noise in the two detectors to be uncorrelated , @xmath38 , and the one - sided noise psd in each detector @xmath8 is given through the defining equation , @xmath39 we also assume @xmath40 , that is the signal and noise are uncorrelated .",
    "we are now ready to write down the optimal filter . in paper",
    "i it has been shown that the optimal filter for a given time segment labeled by @xmath32 and for a point source in the direction @xmath3 is given by , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a normalization constant , which in any case cancels out in the snr .",
    "the snr @xmath31 is given in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath44 which are the mean and standard deviation respectively of @xmath45 .",
    "to keep the expressions simple we assume that the noise in the detectors is stationary .",
    "this certainly will not be the case , but since we are only interested in order of magnitude results , the assumption is not unjustified .",
    "then @xmath46 becomes a function of @xmath10 only .",
    "also we consider a band - width @xmath47 for evaluating the snr ; the lower limit @xmath48 is determined by the seismic cut - off , while the upper limit @xmath49 is decided by the gw sources above which we do not expect significant contribution to the snr . given this",
    ", the relevant quantities can be best expressed in terms of the following two averages : h^2 _ bw & = & _ f_1^f_2 df   , + ^2 _ 1  day ( ) & = & _ 0^ ^2 ( , t )  dt , [ av ] where @xmath50 .",
    "the first is the noise weighted average of the signal @xmath51 , the suffix bw denotes bandwidth , while the second is the time average of the squared directed overlap reduction function taken over one sidereal day .",
    "it is a function of sky position of the source .",
    "but since the azimuth is averaged over @xmath52 , it is just a function of the declination of the source .",
    "then in terms of these averages we have , ( t ) & = &   ( f )   h^2 _ bw   ^2 ( , t ) , + ( t ) & = &  ( f)^  h^2 _ bw^1/2  ( , t ) . then using the continuous limit of eq . ( [ snr1 ] ) , we may write the snr @xmath31 in terms of the averages as follows : & = & ^ , + & = & 2   ( t f)^   h^2 _ bw^1/2   ^2 _ 1  day^1/2 . [ snr2 ]",
    "we now use this expression to compute the snr for the continuous wave sources from the virgo cluster .",
    "we observe that the snr scales as @xmath53 .    to fix ideas we can look at a simplified situation of identical detectors with white noise @xmath54 in the frequency range @xmath47 and @xmath55 otherwise .",
    "similarly we may consider flat signal spectrum @xmath56 , then the snr simplifies to : = 2  [ t f]^   ^2 _ 1  day^1/2 .",
    "the values of @xmath57 for various combinations of detector baselines are given in table i for the virgo cluster which has a declination @xmath58 .",

    "we consider gravitational waves from rotating neutron stars in the virgo cluster . one important parameter of this source is the population of such neutron stars .",
    "the number of galactic neutron stars is estimated to be @xmath60 since the birth rate is about @xmath61yr and the age of the galactic disk is about @xmath62yr .",
    "what is more important in our case is the number of galactic neutron stars whose rotation period is of the order of milliseconds . from the survey of radio pulsars in our galactic disk ,",
    "the population of millisecond pulsars is estimated to be at least 40000 @xcite which implies a birth rate of @xmath63yr .",
    "this is consistent with other studies of the millisecond pulsar population by ferrario and wickramasinghe ( @xmath64yr ) @xcite and by story et al .",
    "( @xmath65yr ) @xcite . from the recent observation of gamma rays with the fermi satellite @xcite",
    ", the population of millisecond pulsars in our galactic globular cluster is estimated to be 2600 - 4700 which is one order lower than millisecond pulsars in the galactic disk .",
    "although there might be significant population of millisecond pulsars which do not emit radio waves , x and gamma rays now , since the life times of millisecond pulsars are believed to be long ( @xmath66yr ) @xcite , we do not expect a large population of such millisecond pulsars to exist .",

    "<S> the cross - correlation search has been previously applied to map the gravitational wave ( gw ) stochastic background in the sky and also to target gw from rotating neutron stars / pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate how the cross - correlation method can be used to target a small region in the sky spanning at most a few pixels , where a pixel in the sky is determined by the diffraction limit which depends on the ( i ) baseline joining a pair of detectors and ( ii ) detector bandwidth . here as one of the promising targets , we consider the virgo cluster - a `` hot spot '' spanning few pixels - which could contain , as estimates suggest @xmath0 neutron stars , of which a small fraction would continuously emit gw in the bandwidth of the detectors . for the detector baselines , we consider advanced detector pairs among lcgt , ligo , virgo , et etc . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that sufficient signal to noise can be accumulated with integration times of the order of a year . </S>",
    "<S> the results improve for the multibaseline search . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis could as well be applied to other likely hot spots in the sky and other possible pairs of detectors . </S>"
