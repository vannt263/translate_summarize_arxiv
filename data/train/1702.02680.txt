    "regularization methods play important roles in many ill - posed inverse problems arising in science and engineering .",
    "examples include inverse problems considered in signal processing and image sciences such as image denoising , image impainting , image deconvolution  @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "mathematically , a image restoration problem can be viewed as reconstructing a clean image @xmath0 from a degraded image @xmath1 based on the degradation relationship @xmath2 .",
    "it is challenging to reconstruct @xmath0 from @xmath1 as the problem is usually ill - posed due to the highly underdetermined constraints and possible noise .",
    "observations of natural image with prior information such as piecewise smoothness , shape edges , textures , repetitive patterns and sparse representations under certain transformations make regularization methods quite effective to handle image processing problems .",
    "successful methods include the total variation ( tv ) methods , nonlocal methods and wavelet tight frame methods  @xcite and many others .",
    "moreover , regularization methods can also be considered in problems arising from data science .",
    "a typical example is semi - supervised learning , where tasks aim at labeling data from a small amount of labeled training data set .",
    "regularization methods such as the harmonic extension method  @xcite have been considered to this type of ill - posed problem . in this paper",
    ", we consider a different regularization , called manifold based low - rank ( mlr ) regularization as a linearization of manifold dimension , which generalizes the global low - rank prior knowledge for linear objects to manifold - region - based locally low - rank for nonlinear objects .",
    "the idea of the mlr proposed in this paper is inspired by a recent method called the low - dimensional manifold model ( ldmm ) discussed in  @xcite . using the image patches",
    "discussed in nonlocal methods  @xcite , the ldmm interprets image patches as a point cloud sampled in a low - dimensional manifold embedded in a high dimensional ambient space , which provides a new way of regularization by minimizing the dimension of the corresponding image patch manifold .",
    "this can be explained as a natural extension of the idea of low - rank regularization for linear objects to data with more complicated structures .",
    "moreover , the authors in  @xcite elegantly find that the point - wisely defined manifold dimension can be computed as a dirichlet energy of the coordinate functions on the manifold , whose corresponding boundary value problem can be further solved by a point integral method proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the ldmm performs very well in image inpainting and super - resolution .",
    "this model is later considered in collaborative ranking problems  @xcite .",
    "based on weighted graph laplacian ( wgl ) , an improvement of ldmm called ldmm+wgl is proposed more recently in @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we propose a manifold based low - rank regularization method for image restoration and semi - supervised learning .",
    "the proposed regularization can be viewed as a point - wise linearization of the manifold dimension , which generalize the concept of low - rank regularization for linear objects as a concept of manifold based low - rank for nonlinear objects . using the proposed regularization",
    ", we investigate new methods of image inpaining , image super - resolution and x - ray ct image reconstruction .",
    "we further extend this method to a general data analysis problem , semi - supervised learning .",
    "intensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed mlr method is comparable to or even outperforms the existing wavelet based models @xcite and pde based models @xcite .",
    "several directions will be investigated in our future work .",
    "for instance , the current method can be adapted to handle images with noisy input .",
    "it is also an important problem to explore a better method to pick the  local regions \" or manifold representation .",
    "for example , for semi - supervised learnings , the left image in figure [ fig : minstlocalsimilar ] shows that the knn obtained by euclidean distance may still include some ambiguity .",
    "in particular , some knns may have local rank as high as 7 or 8 , which reduces the reliability of local low rank regularization .",
    "therefore , developing a data - driven approach to non - euclidean geometry for mlr will be a very interesting direction to investigate in our future work .",
    "we thank prof .",
    "stanley osher , prof .",
    "zuoqiang shi and mr .",
    "wei zhu kindly share their valuable comments and codes of both ldmm and ldmm+wgl for comparisons ."
