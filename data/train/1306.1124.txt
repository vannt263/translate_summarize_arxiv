    "accurate black hole mass measurements are important because they are the building blocks of the empirical relations between the central black hole and the properties of the host bulge , e.g. the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath1 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the luminosity @xmath3 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretations of the relations are crucial for understanding the growth of black holes , their density distribution and ultimately their roles in the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "it is therefore necessary to establish unbiased and well - defined correlations , to determine if there is truly a physical connection between the black hole and the host galaxy ( see the recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "the upper end of these relations is the most critical part .",
    "the galaxy sample that shapes the relations in this regime is still relatively sparse .",
    "based on the black hole sample compiled in @xcite , there are only 15 galaxies with @xmath1  above 250 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1  and @xmath2-@xmath3  relations contradict each other in predicting the mass function of the most massive black holes @xcite , with @xmath2-@xmath3  giving a higher density of black holes .",
    "in addition to that , the @xmath0-@xmath1  relation implies that the largest black holes powering distant quasars are rare or absent in the local universe .",
    "@xcite find the highest @xmath1 in sdss dr2 galaxies at @xmath7 to be 444 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "according to the latest version of the @xmath0-@xmath1  relation @xcite , @xmath0 of @xmath8@xmath5  requires @xmath9 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "these issues can be resolved if the @xmath0-@xmath1  relation is curved upwards or has large intrinsic scatter at the high mass end .",
    "the very recent discovery of two black hole masses of @xmath10 @xmath5  in bcgs supports this view @xcite .",
    "the finding also implies that bcgs might be the host of quasar remnants . with these new indications , enlarging the size of the black hole sample at the high-@xmath1  end becomes even more important .",
    "on top of that , the accuracy of the measurements also needs to be improved .",
    "recent publications on dynamical masses of black holes in the center of galaxies focus on the need for including a dark matter halo ( dm ) in the modeling ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these investigations were initiated by @xcite .",
    "they find that the black hole mass ( @xmath0 ) estimate in m87 increases by more than a factor of two when the dark halo is taken into account .",
    "they argue that this is due to the degeneracy of the mass components , i.e. black hole , stars and dm . in dynamical modeling ,",
    "only the total enclosed mass is constrained . omitting the dark halo component in the model",
    "forces the actual stellar mass budget to account for the galaxy s dark matter as well , i.e. increasing the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "since @xmath11  is assumed to be constant at all radii , @xmath0  has to decrease to compensate for the higher stellar mass .",
    "the effect of including dm is thought to be important for massive galaxies with shallow luminosity profiles in the center : the line - of - sight kinematics close to the black hole is more affected by the contribution from the stars at large radii where dm is dominant .",
    "subsequent papers have presented several new @xmath0  measurements with and without dm in the models and have shown how much @xmath0  changes with the inclusion of dm .",
    "the results vary .",
    "@xcite revisit ngc4649 and see only a negligible increase in @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite report a new measurement for ngc6086 and observe that @xmath0  becomes larger by a factor of six when dm is included .",
    "@xcite reanalyze @xmath0  of 12 galaxies , spanning a wide range of stellar velocity dispersions , and find an average increase of 20 percent ; all the changes in @xmath0  are well within the measurement errors .",
    "m87 is remodeled by @xcite using high - spatial - resolution data and they find similar @xmath0  with and without dm .",
    "the authors attribute the consistent @xmath0  to data which resolves the sphere of influence ( soi ) and thereby breaks the degeneracy between @xmath11  and @xmath0 .",
    "the spatial resolution required to guarantee an unbiased @xmath0without the need to include dm is , however , not clear . to avoid systematic biases in the black - hole bulge relations ,",
    "understanding the effect of dm on @xmath0 , and thereby providing unbiased @xmath0measurements , is essential .",
    "we present ten new black hole measurements , primarily based on integral - field unit ( ifu ) data obtained using sinfoni with adaptive optics . for each galaxy ,",
    "we address the question of how @xmath0  would change when dm is present in the modeling .",
    "the ten galaxies increase the number of @xmath0  measurements at the very high mass end of the smbh distribution .",
    "nine of the galaxies have velocity dispersions greater than 250 km  s@xmath6 , while only one has a dispersion less than 200 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "they belong to a class of galaxies whose @xmath0  values are thought to be most affected by the inclusion or exclusion of dm halos in the models .",
    "this work provides the first direct measurements of the black hole masses for each galaxy in the sample .",
    "the galaxies and their properties are listed in table [ sample ] .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the sinfoni observations and the data reduction are described in section [ sinfoniobsanddatared ] .",
    "we present sinfoni kinematics and describe the additional kinematic data that we use in the modeling in section [ kinematicdata ] .",
    "the surface photometry and the light distribution are discussed in section [ lightdistrib ] .",

    "section [ bhmasses ] presents the resulting black hole masses , together with the corresponding mass - to - light ratios .",
    "we discuss the influence of including the dm on @xmath0  and @xmath11  in section [ bhduetodm ] .",
    "the black hole - bulge scaling relations are addressed in section [ bhbulgerel ] .",
    "we conclude the paper by summarizing the results in section [ summ ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we show the kinematic fit of the best - fit model with dm to the data in figs . [ kin1374][kin7619 ] .",

    "<S> adaptive - optics assisted sinfoni observations of the central regions of ten early - type galaxies are presented . based primarily on the sinfoni kinematics , ten black hole masses occupying the high - mass regime of the @xmath0-@xmath1  relation are derived using three - integral schwarzschild models . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of dark matter inclusion on the black hole mass is explored . </S>",

    "<S> however , when the diameter of the sphere of influence  computed using the black hole mass derived without a dark halo  is at least 10 times the psf fwhm during the observations , it is safe to exclude a dark matter component in the dynamical modeling , i.e. the change in black hole mass is negligible . when the spatial resolution is marginal , restricting the mass - to - light ratio to the right value returns the correct @xmath0  although dark halo is not present in the model . compared to the @xmath0-@xmath1  and @xmath2-@xmath3  relations of mcconnell et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2011 ) , the ten black holes are all more massive than expected from the luminosities and seven black hole masses are higher than expected from the stellar velocity dispersions of the host bulges . using new fitted relations which include the ten galaxies , we find that the space density of the most massive black holes ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) estimated from the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation is higher than the estimate based on the @xmath0-@xmath1  relation and the latter is higher than model predictions based on quasar counts , each by about an order of magnitude . </S>"
