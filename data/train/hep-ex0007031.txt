    ", the primary vertex is required to be @xmath48 80 cm ( one hadronic interaction length ) from exterior surfaces of the calorimeter , and the final state must contain a non - scattering , exiting track with ionization compatible with a muon mass . this sample is useful because the assignment of @xmath0  flavor is reliable to better than 98% , and because the events are relatively energetic and consequently  point well \" to the incident @xmath15 direction .",
    "the mean energy for neutrinos which initiate pces is estimated to be 4.7 gev , to be compared to a mean energy of 1.3 gev for @xmath0  hires events .",
    "the mean angular deviation of the reconstructed @xmath0  direction versus the true direction ( in monte carlo ) is @xmath49 .",
    "unfortunately the number of @xmath0  pces is low , less than one - third the population of our @xmath0  hires sample .    in order to isolate pce two - prong and multiprong topologies ,",
    "the data events ( with mc events interspersed throughout ) are processed through a software filter ; those which pass are scanned .",
    "the filter is designed to eliminate downward - stopping muons which have endpoint decays . in soudan-2 ,",
    "an electron from a muon decay near rangeout can give rise to a small shower of @xmath50 10 hits from the end of a muon track ; the topology is roughly akin to that of a neutrino - induced two - prong .",
    "consequently care must be taken to avoid remnant up - down asymmetry in pces introduced by the filter .",
    "the problem is avoided by requiring that there be @xmath48 20 hits from a pce vertex which are additional to the muon track .    to mitigate against cosmic - ray induced backgrounds we require that any hit in the active shield which is coincident with a pce , must be clearly associated with the exiting muon track .",
    "occasionally it happens that a charged pion ejected from the cavern rock is incident upon the calorimeter .",
    "if the pion penetrates by more than an interaction length and then scatters inelastically , it can mimic a @xmath15 pce topology .",
    "background events of this type are removed by requiring the net momentum of the hadronic system of a pce to lie within the same hemisphere which contains the candidate muon track .    with these selections",
    "we obtain 31 @xmath0  events for which the cosmic ray induced background is less than one event . the @xmath0  pce rate predicted by our monte carlo with no oscillations",
    "is 40 events .",
    "the distribution of pce data in @xmath51 can be compared , as done previously for contained hires @xmath0  events , to representative oscillation scenarios having @xmath7  = 1.0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig07 ] we observe that , compared to the data ( crosses ) the oscillation prediction ( dashed histogram ) is relatively high for @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig07]a ) . however the prediction for @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig07]d ) is too low relative to the data . figs .",
    "[ fig : fig07]b , c suggest that the scenario preferred by the data lies in the regime between @xmath52 .",

    "additionally , a sample of upward - stopping muon events initiated by neutrino reactions below the detector has been isolated and will be analyzed for oscillation effects .",
