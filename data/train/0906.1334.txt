    "long before the microscopic theory , a phenomenological approach to superconductivity was proposed by ginzburg and landau @xcite .",
    "the idea was that the normal - superconducting transition is a thermodynamical second order transition .",
    "so one can apply to it the general theory of second - order transitions defining an order parameter @xmath8 in such a way that @xmath8 is zero in the disordered state ( normal metal ) and finite in the ordered state ( superconducting metal ) .",
    "the free energy of a superconductor is given by @xcite @xmath9 the transition from normal to superconducting state in a magnetic field is second order and near the transition point the order parameter is small , @xmath10 and hence one can easily linerize the ginzburg - landau equation to the following form @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath8 stands for the complex superconducting order parameter and @xmath12 is the first ginzburg - landau parameter , related to the temperature - dependent coherence length , @xmath13 , by @xmath14 .",
    "the starting point of the theoretical description of nucleation ( _ i.e. _ onset ) of superconductivity in an applied magnetic field is this linearized ginzburg - landau equation ( lgle ) .",
    "one can easily identify that the eq .",
    "( 2 ) is identical with the schr@xmath7dinger equation for a free charged particle of mass @xmath15 and charge @xmath16 in a magnetic field @xmath17 , with @xmath18 playing the role of the energy eigenvalue .",
    "this property allows us to apply various familiar solutions and methods of usual quantum mechanics to the problem of nucleation in superconductivity .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue of the lgle gives the highest magnetic field at which the nucleation of the superconductivity can occur .",
    "now the big question is what happens in nonstationary cases ? for instance , if one applies an external electric field which varies very slowly , is it possible that the order parameter will be given by the same equation as in the static case where the time is a parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "if the field varies very rapidly with time will it be possible that the superconductor will respond to an average of the field as it happens in other systems in physics ?",
    "the last quary is our basic investigation in this work .",
    "time dependent ginzburg landau ( tdgl ) model often gives a reasonable picture of superconducting dynamics @xcite .",
    "unlike from its static counterpart , validity of the tdgl theory is much more limited .",
    "it is not enough just to be close to the critical temperature .",
    "the necessary condition is that the deviation from equilibrium is small ; the quasiparticle excitations should remain essentially in equilibrium with the heat bath .",
    "it can normally be fulfilled for gapless superconductor @xcite .",
    "so , we begin by writing down the time - dependent ginzburg landau equation that governs the dynamics of the superconducting order parameter @xcite : @xmath19 now choosing the electrical potential @xmath20 , @xmath21 along the z axis with convenient gauge @xmath22 and linearizing one can show @xmath23 now using @xmath24 and then following the method of cook _ et al _ @xcite one obtains @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "+      in this subsection , we calculate the critical nucleation field of superconductivity in the presence of an external magnetic field for a large sample .",
    "we consider the large sample in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath27 along the @xmath28 axis and a convenient gauge is @xmath22 .",
    "equation ( 5 ) is our starting point of discussion about bulk nucleation .",
    "equation ( 5 ) is same as that of a schr@xmath7dinger equation for a particle of mass @xmath15 bound in a harmonic oscillator potential with force constant @xmath29 .",
    "the resulting harmonic oscillator eigenvalues are @xmath30 in view of eq .",
    "( 5 ) these energy eigenvalues , @xmath31 , are to be equated to @xmath32 .",
    "thus @xmath33 here , we are concerned about the highest value of @xmath21 _ i.e. _ @xmath0 which is obviously given by the lowest eigenvalue ( @xmath34 , @xmath2 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "thus @xmath36 where flux quantum @xmath37 .",
    "the above relation @xmath38 gives us an important message .",
    "when @xmath39 , @xmath40 and vortex phase in the type - ii superconductor appears . on the other hand for @xmath41 , @xmath42 and meissner effect sets in , the mixed phase does not appear and one obtains type - i superconductor .",
    "+ on the other hand , for @xmath43 , @xmath44 it is evident from eq . ( 9 ) that the highly oscillating electric field actually increases the nucleation field by an amount @xmath45 in the bulk nucleation of superconductivity .",
    "so far in my treatment of the ginzburg - landau equation at the mean - field level we have not taken into account the surface of the sample . at the surface of the superconductor ,",
    "some additional boundary conditions need to be imposed on the solutions .",
    "one can quite reasonably expect that the presence of an interface between the superconductor and a non - superconducting material , such as a normal metal or an insulator must affect the nucleation of superconductivity in the material .",
    "we consider a specimen with a single plane surface and the external magnetic field to be parallel to the surface _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46 .",
    "the superconducting sample is located in the half - space @xmath47 , while we take the non - superconducting material to be located in the half space @xmath48 .",
    "the latter material is taken to be either vacuum or an insulating material .",
    "then the superconducting boundary condition imposed on @xmath8 in finite samples @xcite : @xmath49 it reduces to the neumann boundary condition , @xmath50 , when the magnetic vector potential , @xmath51 , can be chosen in a form with zero normal component at the boundary of the sample . in my case",
    "this becomes @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "we look for a solution of the form @xmath54 for the linearized tdgl equation ( eq .",
    "4 ) with the constraints : @xmath55 the complication arises because the boundary condition states that the solution must be flat at a position @xmath56 while the minimum is located at @xmath57 . when the minimum of the potential is located far from the surface ( @xmath58 )",
    "one can ignore the boundary condition , and when @xmath59 the boundary condition is satisfied by the standard solution of usual schr@xmath7dinger equation of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "thus in both the cases we obtain @xmath60 .",
    "one can easily understand that the surfaces have consequences for the solution to the lgle only at the intermediate values of @xmath61 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath62 . for the intermediate values of @xmath61",
    ", we can think of solving the schr@xmath7dinger equation by employing the effective hamiltonian method of cook _ et al _ @xcite and thus the effective schr@xmath7dinger like equation becomes @xmath63 this is an eigenvalue problem where the eigenvalue itself is @xmath61 dependent , and my task is to minimize this with respect to @xmath61 subject to the boundary condition on @xmath64 at the surface . introducing @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , one can rewrite eq .",
    "( 14 ) as follows : @xmath69 now my task is to find the lowest possible value of @xmath70 subjected to the boundary conditions @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "this can be phrased as the following variational problem of minimizing the functional @xmath73 with respect to variations in @xmath64 .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation for this variational problem is precisely the scaled differential eq .",
    "( 15 ) . to do the minimization , we use the following trial wave - function : @xmath74 with the help of this trial wave - function , we obtain @xmath75 now minimizing @xmath70 with respect to @xmath76",
    ", we obtain @xmath77 which yields @xmath78 . substituting this back in @xmath70 and again minimizing with respect to b , we find @xmath79 and it gives us @xmath80 . substituting this back into @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath81 from the definition of @xmath70 one can relate @xmath82 thus @xmath83 in view of equation ( 23 ) one can realize that the physically accessible region is defined as follows : @xmath84 . now solving equation ( 23 ) for ` h ' one obtains @xmath85 from eq . ( 24 ) , we obtain for @xmath2 , @xmath86 and for @xmath43 , the surface nucleation field @xmath87 .",
    "the main message of eq .",
    "( 24 ) is that when the superconductivity occurs in a system , it starts to nucleate at the surface of an ideal defect - free sample and not in the interior of the sample .",
    "if the sample has defects in the interior , superconductivity starts to nucleate in the vicinity of such defects . on the other hand the high frequency field further accentuates the nucleation at the surface rather than in the interior of the sample which is evident from equation ( 24 ) .",
    "for the bulk sample the increasing amount due to the rapidly oscillating field is @xmath45 ( see equation 9 ) . on the other hand the rapidly oscillating field increases the surface nucleation field by an amount @xmath88 ( see equation 24 ) .",
    "thus the rapidly oscillating electric field accentuates the surface nucleation field by @xmath89 times more than the bulk nucleasion field increasing factor . from equation ( 9 ) and equation ( 24 ) one can determine the real values for this enhancement in nucleation field .",
    "if an experimentalist uses @xmath90 v / m , @xmath91 ghz , the enhancement of the bulk nucleation field is @xmath92 t more than the without driven result . for the same values of electric field strength and frequency , the enhancement of surface nucleation field is @xmath93 t more than the non - driven system .",
    "+ before concluding this subsection we want to show the analogy between the problem of nucleation of superconductivity at the surface with that of a double oscillator .",
    "equation ( 14 ) is still have the form of schr@xmath7dinger equation for a particle in a harmonic well centered at @xmath61 , but the boundary condition , eqs .",
    "( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , means that the eigenvalue depends crucially on the value of @xmath61 .",
    "one can incorporate the boundary condition by an image method .",
    "we consider a particle moving in the potential @xmath94 of fig .",
    "2(b ) which is my original harmonic well together with its reflection at the surface .",
    "the ground - state wave function @xmath95 in @xmath94 must be symmetric about @xmath56 , as required in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , and for @xmath47 it satisfies eq .",
    "thus @xmath95 for @xmath47 is the solution to our problem , and the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath96 gives the critical field .",
    "we can compare @xmath96 for various @xmath61 with the eigenvalue @xmath97 in the single harmonic well .",
    "for @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and for @xmath59 , @xmath100 again . on the other hand for intermediate values of @xmath61",
    ", @xmath96 is less than @xmath97 because @xmath94 is smaller than the single harmonic potential in some region .",
    "the new surface eigenfunction must have a lower eigenvalue than the interior ones because it arises from a potential that is lower and broader than the single harmonic well about @xmath61 .",
    "thus one can say that the problem of nucleation of superconductivity at the surface is analogous to that of double oscillator problem .",
    "the analysis of the previous section has clearly demonstrated that the problem of nucleation of superconductivity in the bulk and at the surface are analogous to that of a single harmonic oscillator and double oscillator respectively .",
    "a. p. van gelder had shown that the problem of nucleation resembles that of finding the ground state energy of a quantum particle and the nucleation field is inversely proportional to the ground state energy @xcite .",
    "henceforth , one can easily calculate the nucleation field ratio , @xmath6 , by calculating the ground state energies of a single harmonic oscillator and a double oscillator . due to the recent developments in the regime of superconducting high frequency devices",
    "@xcite , we would like to exhibit the effect of high frequency field on the nucleation of superconductivity in this section .",
    "the effect of high frequency field can be taken care of by simply following the effective hamiltonian method @xcite . by following cook _",
    "et al _ @xcite , we convert the time - dependent problem into an effective time independent one and then calculate the ground state energy by following standard stationary quantum mechanics procedures .",
    "thus the main objective of this section is to find the nucleation field ratio , @xmath6 , from the eigenvalue solutions of the single harmonic oscillator and the double oscillator in both the cases _ i.e. _ in the presence and absence of the high frequency field . + we consider a quantum particle moving in a double oscillator potential @xmath101 and driven by a high frequency monochromatic force .",
    "thus the driven double - oscillator hamiltonian becomes @xmath102 now following cook _",
    "et al _ @xcite we can express the effective time - independent potential @xmath103 to determine ground state energy of this driven double oscillator , we consider the normalized ground - state eigenfunctions of single oscillators centered at @xmath104 : @xmath105 where we have introduced dimensionless variables @xmath106 and @xmath107 with @xmath108 . now ,",
    "we compute the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath109 , in the state @xmath110 .",
    "the norm of @xmath111 is @xmath112 . to compute the expectation value of the kinetic energy operator ( @xmath113 ) we need to use the identity @xmath114 thus",
    ", we find @xmath115 to obtain the expectation value of the potential energy operator @xmath116 , we need to compute @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "so , we obtain @xmath119 finally the ground state energy of the driven oscillator is given by @xmath120    in fig .",
    "3 , we plot the ground - state energy versus @xmath121 for the double - oscillator in the presence as well as absence of the external high frequency field .",
    "as pointed out by a. p. van gelder the critical nucleation field is inversely proportional to the ground state energy .",
    "thus , we calculate the critical nucleation field ratio ( @xmath6 ) from the numerical computation of the minimum of ground state energies of the double and single oscillators ( eq .",
    "minimum ground state energies for the double oscillator ( dosc ) in the presence and absence of the external field are computed from eq .",
    "( 31 ) by putting @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 respectively . on the other hand the ground state energies for the single oscillator ( sosc . ) in the presence and absence of the field ( @xmath125 ) can be computed from the eq .",
    "( 31 ) by simply putting @xmath126 . from our computation",
    ", we obtain the minimum of ground state energies for the double - oscillator with external rapidly oscillating force ( wf ) and without force ( wof ) cases are @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively",
    ". thus the ratio of the critical fields for the force - free case is given by @xmath129 we have to mention that a more careful numerical analysis based on the hypergeometric functions in the non - driven system yields ( exact result ) @xmath130 from the variational principle one obtains @xmath131 and from the ground state energy method , we obtain @xmath132 . now comparing these two results with equation ( 33 )",
    "one can say that the results obtained from the two approximated theories ( variational principle and ground state enrgy ) agree very well with the exact results .",
    "this establishes the validity of these two approximated theories .",
    "+ now , we employ the ground state energy method to deternine the nucleation field ratio in the presence of the externally applied high frequency field : @xmath133 in view of eq .",
    "( 34 ) and eq .",
    "( 32 ) , we can conclude that the nucleation field ratio for the driven system is slightly larger than the non - driven system .",
    "the basic inference that one can draw from the above discussion is that the high frequency field accentuates the surface critical nucleation field of superconductivity more than that of the bulk critical nucleation field .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize all my derived results and then conclude this paper .",
    "we investigate the effect of high frequency electric field on the nucleation of superconductivity in the interior of a large sample as well as at the surface of a finite sample . employing the linearized time dependent ginzburg - landau theory for this purpose",
    "we have shown the analogy between quantum single harmonic oscillator and the nucleation in the interior of a large sample .",
    "the similarities between the nucleation of superconductivity at the surface and a quantum double oscillator is also demonstrated .",
    "we invoke two approximate theories to derive critical nucleation field ratio @xmath6 .",
    "the first approximate theory is based on the variational principle and is solved analytically . on the other hand the second approximate theory is based on the ground state energy method of a. p. van gelder @xcite .",
    "we determine the minimum of the ground state energy by the numerical method . since critical nucleation field is inversely proportional to the ground state energy one can easily compute the critical nucleation field ratio .",
    "the validity of these two approximated theories is checked by comparing the results obtained from these two theories with that of the exact results for the case of nondriven system and they agree very well with each other .",
    "the effect of high frequency oscillating time - periodic field is taken care of by the effctive time - independent hamiltonian method of cook et al @xcite .",
    "it is observed that for electric field strength @xmath134 v / m and frequency @xmath91 ghz one can obtain 0.114 t and 0.189 t much more enhancement in the bulk nucleation and surface nucleation field respectively .",
    "+ in conclusion , we examine in details the effect of high frequency field on the nucleation of superconductivity . using the variational method and ground state energy method we have shown that the high frequency field actually accentuates the surface critical nucleation field of superconductivity more than the bulk critical nucleation field .",
    "the enhancement of the surface critical nucleation field is 1.6592 times more than the enhancement of the bulk critical nucleation field .",
    "one can now say that the ratio @xmath6 is not universal i.e. @xmath1 is not the universal upper limit of nucleation .",
    "one can obtain higher than @xmath1 field by applying high frequency oscillating electric field .",
    "our results will be helpful in analyzing recently developed high - frequency superconducting devices @xcite .",
