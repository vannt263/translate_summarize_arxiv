    "the use of the spatially profiled repulsive nonlinearities for the creation of multidimensional solitons is more than an exploration of an exotic possibility .",

    "the subject of the present work is to predict the creation of stable bright solitons in nearly-2d or 1d dipolar condensates , which are trapped , respectively ( by means of an appropriate optical potential ) , in a thin layer close to @xmath9 ( or in a  cigar \" around axis @xmath10 ) , with the local strength of the _ repulsive _ ddi growing fast enough at @xmath11 ( or at @xmath12 ) .",

    "trapped modes can not exist in the presence of the expulsive potential which indefinitely grows at @xmath79 .",
    "however , as is shown below , the system considered in a finite area of a reasonably large size may readily overcome the destructive effect of the ep .",

    "further , results for the 1d and 2d settings , presented in figs . [ 1dfundamental ] and [ 2dfundamental ] , respectively , along with the modulation profile ( [ d ] ) adopted below , demonstrate that , within the area of the actual localization of the solitons , the field increases from the center to periphery by a factor @xmath92 @xmath93 , which is compatible with the above - mentioned range of the values of @xmath94 . because the density of the condensate is very low ( @xmath95 @xmath96 , in the most typical case ) , and the contact of molecules with the field - inducing grids is prevented by the optical trap , see fig .",

    "in addition to that , a straightforward analysis of the scaling for the effective area of the 2d solitons yields @xmath170 , which also agrees well with the empiric scaling exponents indicated in figs . [ fig5d ] and [ fig6d ] .",
    "numerical tests of the perturbed evolution demonstrate that both the fundamental and vortex soliton families are entirely stable .",
    "comparison to the model with the spatially modulated coefficient in front of the local self - defocusing term @xcite suggests that instability may arise for higher - order vortices .",
    "this issue is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "as well as in the model with the spatially modulated strength of the repulsive local nonlinearity @xcite , it is relevant to consider motion of stable solitons , which can be naturally initiated by a sudden shift of the soliton from the central position , and/or by kicking it . in this section , we study oscillatory and elliptic motion of 1d and 2d solitons , respectively , in the absence of the ep in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) , @xmath101 .      in the 1d case ,",
    "the motion of the fundamental soliton was initiated by a shift ( @xmath46 ) , which corresponds to initial condition @xmath171 .",
    "figure [ 1doscillation ] displays generic examples of the subsequent evolution of the shifted solitons , for different values of @xmath121 . in figs .",
    "[ fig7a ] and [ fig7b ] , pertaining to @xmath147 , the soliton initially compresses itself , and then approximately keeps its shape , performing undamped , although apparently irregular , oscillations around the center .  in figs . [ fig7c ] - [ fig7h ] corresponding to @xmath172 ( @xmath173 @xmath174 and @xmath175 ) , the frequency of the oscillatory motion increases with @xmath121 , while the amplitude of the center - of - mass oscillations gradually decreases , and the soliton suffers a slow decay , in the course of the evolution . the oscillating soliton features a gradual decay too with the increase of the initial shift , see an example in fig .",
    "fig8xa . eventually , the soliton is quickly destroyed if the initial shift exceed a certain critical value , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8xb ] .      in the 2d case",
    ", one may expect the motion of a soliton , considered as a quasi - particle , along an elliptic trajectory , which can be initiated by shifting the soliton from the center along the @xmath10-direction ( by distance @xmath41 ) , and simultaneously kicking it ( in other words , imparting some velocity , @xmath176 ) in the @xmath177-direction , i.e. , setting @xmath178 .",
    "figures [ elliptic1 ] and [ elliptic2 ] show results of the simulations at different values of @xmath41 and @xmath176 .",
    "similar to the 1d case , the moving soliton maintains its shape for small @xmath41 and @xmath176 , but splits into fragments if either @xmath46 or @xmath176 becomes too large .",
    "therefore , we here discuss in detail only the case of small @xmath46 and @xmath176",
    ". figures [ elliptic1 ] and [ elliptic2 ] show results of such simulations for @xmath147 and @xmath179 .    as well as in the 1d",
    "setting , @xmath121 strongly affects the motion . in fig [ elliptic1 ] , panels ( a)-(g )",
    "show that , at @xmath147 , the soliton keeps its shape and follows a stable elliptic trajectory for a relatively long time , see panel [ elliptic1](i ) . on the other hand , for @xmath180 fig .",
    "[ elliptic2](i ) demonstrates that the soliton s trajectory is an inward - winding spiral , rather than a closed ellipse , and in this case the 2d soliton relatively quickly returns to the center .",
    "the soliton which has returned to the central position maintains _ differential rotation _ in its outer layer , which is necessary to conserve the angular momentum lent to the system by the initial kick .",
    "this vortical structure exists without appearance of a zero density at the center [ see fig . [ elliptic2](g ) and [ elliptic2](h ) ] , which resembles known regimes of the differential rotation in superfluids , see , e.g. , ref . differential .",
    "a natural generalization of the single - well modulation profile ( [ d1d ] ) is a double - well profile . in the 1d setting , it can be defined as @xmath181with two minima set at @xmath182 , where @xmath183 vanishes .",
    "an incentive for the study of this modulation shape is search for a possibility of the spontaneous symmetry breaking between portions of the mean - field wave function trapped in the two symmetric nonlinear potential wells , and also a possibility of josephson oscillations between them @xcite .",
    "here we briefly report results of this analysis performed in the framework of 1d equation ( [ gpe ] ) with @xmath101 .",
    "numerical computations yield stable even and odd states trapped in the double - well modulation profile ( [ ndwp ] )",

    "it is concluded that the even mode represents the ground state , as it corresponds to a minimum of the hamiltonian , although the energies of the two states become practically equal when @xmath121 exceeds a certain critical value , @xmath185 , see fig .",

    ", robust but seemingly irregular josephson oscillations can be readily initiated by placing the original matter - wave packet into one well .",
    "a typical example of robust oscillations is displayed in fig .",
    "the objective of this work is to explore possibilities for the formation of 1d and 2d fundamental solitons and solitary topological modes in the condensate of dipoles induced by spatially inhomogeneous polarizing fields . under physically relevant conditions ,",
    "this can be realized as self - trapping of bright solitons and vortices the under the action of repulsive ddis ( dipole - dipole interactions ) between the induced dipoles .",
    "motivated by the recent analysis reported for the model with contact repulsive interactions @xcite-@xcite , we have demonstrated that this counter - intuitive result is possible if the local dipole moment of particles , induced by the external fields perpendicular to the plane in which the condensate is trapped grows from the center to periphery faster than @xmath1 , for both dimensions @xmath127 and @xmath136 ( unlike the local model , where the growth rate must be faster than @xmath187 ) .",
    "the setting also includes the ep ( expulsive potential ) , due to the interaction of the induced dipoles with the polarizing field .",
    "the ep can be eliminated by choosing an appropriate relation between the dc and ac components of the field .",
    "physical parameters have been estimated for the realization of the setting by means of the electric field .",
    "for modulation profile ( [ d ] ) with @xmath84 , families of fundamental 1d and 2d solitons , 1d dipole modes , and 2d vortices have been found in a numerical form , and their scaling properties , which are essentially different from what was found recently in the local models , were explained analytically . it has also been demonstrated that the 1d and 2d fundamental solitons remain robust in the presence of the ep , provided that it is not too strong .",
    "the families of the trapped modes considered here are entirely stable if the ep is eliminated .",
    "in addition , the tfa ( thomas - fermi approximation ) was developed for the 1d and 2d fundamental solitons .",
    "the character of the solitons confinement is opposite to the character of the repulsive nonlinearity : in the nonlocal model , the solitons are self - trapped tightly ( super - exponentially ) , while the self - trapping in the local model is loose ( algebraic ) .",
    "a fundamental 1d soliton , shifted from the center , performs persistent oscillations if the initial shift is small enough , while a large shift can destroy it .",
    "similarly , shifted and transversely kicked 2d solitons may feature persistent motion along elliptic trajectories .",
    "the 1d double - well modulation profile was considered too . in this case , both symmetric and antisymmetric trapped modes are dynamically stable , the symmetric ones realizing the ground state .",
    "in addition to that , the double - well structure readily supports persistent , although irregular , josephson oscillations between the wells .    as an extension of this work , it may be interesting to study higher - order ( multipole ) modes in the 1d setting , and higher - order vortices in 2d .",
    "the effect of the ep on the twisted and vortical modes may be interesting too .",
    "another relevant extension may deal with the interplay of the modulated repulsive ddis and contact interactions .",
    "furthermore , it should be quite interesting to study patterns supported by spatially periodic modulations of the polarizing field , which may be a specific ramification of the general concept of nonlinear lattices which , thus far , were considered only in local systems @xcite , expect for very recent work @xcite , where bright solitons were predicted in the 1d condensate of permanent dipoles under the external field periodically changing its orientation along the coordinate .",
