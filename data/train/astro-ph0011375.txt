    "the search for gravitational microlensing in our galaxy has been going on for a decade , following the proposal to use this effect as a probe of the dark matter content of the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "the first microlensing candidates were reported in 1993 , towards the   @xcite and the galactic centre @xcite by the ,  and  collaborations .    because they observed no microlensing candidate with a duration shorter than 10  days , the  and  groups were able to exclude the possibility that more than 10% of the galactic dark matter resides in planet - sized objects @xcite .    however a few events were detected with longer timescales . in their two - year analysis @xcite ,",
    "the  group estimated , from 6 - 8 candidate events towards the , an optical depth of order half that required to account for the dynamical mass of a `` standard '' spherical dark halo within 50  kpc ] ; the typical einstein radius crossing time of the events , @xmath2 , implied an average mass of about 0.5  m@xmath3 for halo lenses @xcite .",
    "based on two candidates ,  set an upper limit on the halo mass fraction in objects of similar masses @xcite , that is below that required to explain the rotation curve of our galaxy .",
    "the second phase of the  programme was started in 1996 , with a ten - fold increase over  in the number of monitored stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "the analysis of the first two years of data towards the small magellanic cloud ( ) allowed the observation of one microlensing event @xcite also detected by @xcite .",
    "this single event , out of 5.3 million monitored stars , allowed   to further constrain the halo composition , excluding in particular that more than 50  % of the standard dark halo is made up of @xmath4 objects @xcite .",
    "in contrast , an optical detection of a halo white dwarf population was reported @xcite , compatible with a galactic halo full of white dwarfs . very recently",
    ", the  group presented an analysis of 5.7 year light curves of 10.7  million stars in the  @xcite with an improved determination of their detection efficiency and a better rejection of background supernova explosions behind the .",
    "they now favour a galactic halo  component of 20% in the form of 0.4  m@xmath3 objects . within a few days ,",
    "the detection of a halo white dwarf population at the level of a 10% component was also reported by @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the  group presented its results from a two - year survey of 17.5 million stars in the  @xcite .",
    "one  microlensing candidate , eros1-lmc-2 , was seen to vary again , 8 years after its first brightening , and was thus eliminated from the list of microlensing candidates .",
    "two new candidates were identified ( eros2-lmc-3 and  4 ) . because this is much lower than expected",
    "if s are a substantial component of the galactic halo , and because these two new candidates do not show excellent agreement with simple microlensing light curves ,  chose to combine these results with those from previous  analyses , and to quote an upper limit on the fraction of the galactic halo in the form of s.    in this article , we describe an update on the  data , an analysis of the three - year light curves from 25.5 million stars .",
    "while the sensitivity is improved , the main conclusions are unchanged compared to @xcite .",
    "one of the two - year candidates was seen to vary in the third season and was thus rejected .",
    "three new candidates have been detected .",
    "we combine these  results with those of previous independent  analyses , and derive the strongest limit obtained thus far on the amount of stellar mass objects in the galactic halo .",
    "the telescope , camera , telescope operation and data reduction are as described in @xcite . since august 1996",
    ", we have been monitoring 66 one square - degree fields in the , simultaneously in two wide passbands .",
    "of these , data prior to may 1999 from 39  square - degrees spread over 64  fields have been analysed . in this period ,",
    "two thirds of the fields were imaged about 210 times in average ; the remaining third were imaged only about 110 times .",
    "the exposure times range from 3  min in the  center to 12  min on the periphery ; the average sampling is once every 4  days ( resp .",
    "8  days ) .",
    "the analysis of the  data set was done using a program independent from that used in the  study , with largely different selection criteria .",
    "the aim is to cross - validate both programs ( as was already done in the analysis of  schmidt photographic plates @xcite ) and avoid losing rare microlensing events .",
    "the analysis is very similar to that reported in @xcite .",
    "we only give here a list of the various steps , as well as a short description of the differences with respect to our two - year analysis .",
    "a detailed description of the analysis will be provided in @xcite .",
    "we first select the 6% `` most variable '' light curves , a sample much larger than the number of detectable variable stars .",
    "this subset of our data is `` enriched '' in genuine variable stars , but also and mainly in photometrically biased light curves , _ i.e. _ those of stars especially sensitive to the observing conditions , such as stars very close to nebulosities or to bright stars .",
    "working from this `` enriched '' subset , we apply a first set of cuts to select , in each colour separately , the light curves that exhibit significant variations .",
    "we first identify the baseline flux in the light curve - basically the most probable flux .",
    "we then search for _ runs _ along the light curve ,  groups of consecutive measurements that are all on the same side of the baseline flux .",
    "we select light curves that either have an abnormally low number of runs over the whole light curve , or show one long run ( at least 5 valid measurements ) that is very unlikely to be a statistical fluctuation .",
    "we then discard light curves with a low signal - to - noise ratio by requiring that the group of 5 most luminous consecutive measurements be significantly further from the baseline than the average spread of the measurements .",
    "we also check that the measurements inside the most significant run show a smooth time variation .",
    "the second set of cuts compares the measurements with the best fit point - lens point - source constant speed microlensing light curve ( hereafter `` simple microlensing '' ) .",
    "they allow us to reject variable stars whose light curves differ too much from simple microlensing , and are sufficiently loose not to reject light curves affected by blending , parallax or the finite size of the source , and most cases of multiple lenses or sources .",
    "we also require that the fitted time of maximum magnification lie within the observing period or very close to it , and that the fitted timescale is shorter than 300 days .",
    "the latter cut is equivalent to requiring that the baseline flux of the star is observed for at least a few months ; this is necessary in any analysis using this baseline flux . at this stage of the analysis ,",
    "all cuts have been applied independently in the two passbands .",
    "after this second set of cuts , stars selected separately in the two passbands represent about 0.01% of the initial sample ; almost all of them are found in two thinly populated zones of the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "the third set of cuts deals with this physical background .",
    "the first zone contains stars brighter and much redder than those of the red clump ; variable stars in this zone are rejected if they vary by less than a factor two or have a very poor fit to simple microlensing .",
    "the second zone is the top of the main sequence , where the selected stars , known as blue bumpers @xcite , display variations that are almost always smaller than 60% of the base flux or at least 20% lower in the visible passband than in the red one .",
    "these can not correspond to simple microlensing , which is achromatic ; neither can they correspond to microlensing plus blending with another unmagnified star , as it would imply blending by even bluer stars , which is very unlikely .",
    "we thus reject all candidates from the second zone exhibiting one of these two features ( see fig .  [ bumper ] ) .",
    "[ ht ]    compared to the analysis in @xcite , two new cuts are introduced to reject other types of variable stars that were not present in the two - year analysis .",
    "the first one is aimed at stars which have a roughly constant luminosity for some time , then vary typically over one or two months to reach a new constant level",
    ". we can not yet conclude whether these are physical variable stars or some kind of instrumental problem .",
    "the second cut is aimed at nov  and supernov .",
    "it rejects light curves which have a rise time significantly smaller than the decline time ; it is not applied to events with a timescale longer than 60 days , in order not to reject microlensing phenomena with parallax effects , that also show an asymmetry .",
    "the final cuts are simply tighter cuts on the fit quality , applied to both colours ( whereas similar previous cuts were applied independently in each passband ) , and a requirement that the observed magnification be at least 1.40  .",
    "the tuning of each cut and the calculation of the microlensing detection efficiency are done with simulated simple microlensing light curves , as described in @xcite . for the efficiency calculation ,",
    "microlensing parameters are drawn as follows  : time of maximum magnification @xmath5 uniformly within the observing period @xmath6  days , impact parameter normalised to the einstein radius @xmath7 $ ] uniformly , and timescale @xmath8 $ ] days uniformly in @xmath9 .",
    "all cuts on the data were also applied to the simulated light curves .",
    "[ ht ]    [ ht ]    only four candidates remain after all cuts . of the two candidates presented in @xcite ,",
    "eros2-lmc-3 is still a member of this list , while eros2-lmc-4 was seen to vary at least twice in the third season and was thus rejected .",
    "there are three new candidates , numbered 5 to 7 .",
    "their light curves are shown in figs .",
    "[ cdl1_evts ] and [ cdl2_evts ] ; microlensing fit parameters are given in table  [ eventparm ] .",
    "although the candidates pass all cuts , agreement with simple microlensing is not excellent . in particular",
    ", eros2-lmc-5 is dubious  : it has a bad fit to simple microlensing and is located in an atypical region of the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "the geometric mean of the candidates timescales is about 32  days , including that of the  candidate lmc-1 .",
    ".results of microlensing fits to the four  candidates ; @xmath2 is the einstein radius crossing time in days , @xmath10 the impact parameter , and @xmath11 the @xmath12 blending coefficients , constrained to be smaller than unity .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "has observed six microlensing candidates towards the magellanic clouds , one from  and four from  towards the , and one towards the . as discussed in @xcite , and further in @xcite , we consider that the long duration of the  candidate together with the absence of any detectable parallax , in our data as well as in that of the  group @xcite , indicates that it is most likely due to a lens in the .",
    "for that reason , the limit derived below uses the five  candidates .",
    "( the limit corresponding to all six candidates would be about a factor 1.13 times the limit shown , for masses larger than 0.01 solar mass . )",
    "the limits on the contribution of dark compact objects to the galactic halo are obtained by comparing the number and durations of microlensing candidates with those expected from galactic halo models .",
    "we use here the so - called `` standard '' halo model described in @xcite as model 1 , but have checked that we obtain similar results for other reasonable halo models .",
    "the model predictions are computed for each data set in turn , taking into account the corresponding detection efficiencies ( @xcite and table  [ eff ] above ) , and the four predictions are then summed . in this model ,",
    "all dark objects have the same mass @xmath13 ; we have computed the model predictions for many trial masses @xmath13 in turn , in the range [ @xmath14 , @xmath15 .    the method used to compute the limit is as in @xcite .",
    "we consider two ranges of timescale @xmath2 , within or outside the interval i  @xmath16 $ ]  days .",
    "this interval was chosen as follows .",
    "we first determine the average mass corresponding to the mean duration of the five  candidates , at about @xmath17 .",
    "we then compute the expected distribution of microlensing timescales for this average mass and check that the observed spread in timescales for the candidates is compatible with the width of this distribution .",
    "this means that our candidates are compatible with the hypothesis that their spread in mass contributes very little to the width of the timescale distribution . the interval  i is then chosen as a symmetrical interval in @xmath9 that contains 99% of the timescale distribution for halo s of @xmath17 .",
    "of course , all five   candidates have timescales well within the interval i.    we can then compute , for each mass @xmath13 and any halo fraction @xmath18 , the combined poisson probability for obtaining , in the four different  data sets taken as a whole , zero candidate outside i and five or less within i. for any value of @xmath13 , the limit @xmath19 is the value of @xmath18 for which this probability is 5% .",
    "whereas the actual limit depends somewhat on the precise choice of i , the difference ( smaller than 5% ) is noticeable only for masses around 0.01 and @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , we consider our choice for i to be a conservative one .",
    "[ ht ]    figure [ excl ] shows the 95% c.l .",
    "exclusion limit derived from this analysis on the halo mass fraction , @xmath18 , for any given dark object mass , @xmath13 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the five  candidates ; it is the main result of this article .",
    "this limit rules out a standard spherical halo model fully comprised of objects with any mass function inside the range @xmath21 \\ ; m_{\\odot}$ ] . in the region of stellar mass objects , where this result improves most on previous ones ,",
    "the new  data contribute about 73% to our total sensitivity ( the  and   data contribute 10% and 17% respectively ) .",
    "the total sensitivity for @xmath22  days , that is proportional to the sum of @xmath23 over the four  data sets , is about 3.2 times larger than that of @xcite and two thirds that of @xcite .",
    "after nine years of monitoring the magellanic clouds ,  has a meager crop of five microlensing candidates towards the  and one towards the , whereas about 30 events are expected towards the for a spherical halo fully comprised of @xmath24 objects .",
    "moreover , some of the candidates can not be considered excellent .",
    "these candidates were obtained from four different data sets analysed by independent , cross - validated programs .",
    "so , the small number of observed events is unlikely to be due to bad ( and overestimated ) detection efficiencies .",
    "this allows us to put strong constraints on the fraction of the halo made of objects in the range [ @xmath25 , @xmath26 , excluding in particular at the 95% c.l . that more than 40% of the standard halo be made of objects with up to @xmath27 .",
    "the preferred value quoted in @xcite , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , is consistent with our limit as can be seen in fig .",
    "( the upper part -  about 25%  - of the domain allowed by @xcite is excluded by the limit we report here . )",
    "there are several differences which should be kept in mind while comparing the two experiments .",
    "first ,  uses less crowded fields than  with the result that blending is relatively unimportant for .",
    "( were  results to be corrected for blending , the detection efficiency would increase slightly and the reported limit would be stronger . )",
    "second ,  covers a larger solid angle ( 64  deg@xmath30 in the and 10  deg@xmath30 in the ) than , which monitors primarily 15  deg@xmath30 in the central part of the",
    ". the  rate should thus be less contaminated by self - lensing , i.e. microlensing of  stars by dimmer  objects , which should be more common in the central regions .",
    "the importance of self - lensing was first stressed in @xcite .",
    "third , the  data have a more frequent time sampling .",
    "the results from  and  are apparently consistent , but the way they are interpreted is different .",
    "reports a signal and considers the contamination of its sample as low or null .",
    "quotes an upper limit and does not claim its sample to be background - free .",
    "the position of the lenses along the line of sight , halo or magellanic clouds , is also an issue .",
    "has compared the spatial distribution of its candidates across the face of the and observes a better agreement with the halo hypothesis than with a specific model of the . on the other hand , because the  stars are spread over a wider field , the fact that the  sample corresponds to a lower central value of the event rate ( about twice lower than that of ) is compatible with an interpretation where a noteable fraction of the events are due to self - lensing .",
    "the small number of  candidates precludes at present any definitive conclusion on that topic .",
    "it seems likely that the single most important input to the question of the position of the lenses will come from the comparison of the microlens candidates samples towards the   with those towards the .",
    "because the two lines of sight are rather close ( about 20  degrees apart ) , the timescale distributions of microlensing candidates towards the two clouds should be nearly identical if lenses belong to the galactic halo .",
    "also , the event rates should be comparable , although the ratio is more halo model dependent . at present ,  has analysed two seasons of  data @xcite and has not yet presented its detection efficiency towards the . from the published  efficiencies , and assuming that the  efficiencies towards the  are similar to those towards the , it can be expected that the completed experiments will have gathered between five and ten microlenses towards the .",
    "this should allow a significant comparison of the timescales ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .    finally , let us mention that",
    ", given the scarcity of our candidates and the possibility that some observed microlenses actually lie in the magellanic clouds ,  is not willing at present to quote a non zero _ lower _ limit on the fraction of the galactic halo comprised of dark compact objects with masses up to a few solar masses .",
