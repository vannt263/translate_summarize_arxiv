    "in @xcite , zelevinsky has introduced an involution of the grothendieck group of the category of complex smooth representations of finite length of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a @xmath6-adic field , and conjectured that this involution permutes the classes of irreducible representations ( @xcite , 9.17 ) . in @xcite , zelevinsky further conjectured a geometric description of this involution in terms of the graded nilpotent orbits that parametrize the simple @xmath7-modules .",
    "both conjectures have been proved by moeglin and waldspurger @xcite for the category of admissible representations of @xmath7 generated by their space of @xmath8-fixed vectors , where @xmath8 is an iwahori subgroup of @xmath7 . in this case , by a theorem of bernstein , borel and matsumoto , the conjectures can be reformulated in terms of the hecke algebra @xmath9 of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "this is an affine hecke algebra of type @xmath10 with parameter @xmath11 equal to the cardinality of the residue field of @xmath5 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the problem then becomes that of describing how the isomorphism classes of simple @xmath9-modules are permuted when the action is twisted by a certain involutive automorphism @xmath12 of @xmath9 .",
    "in fact the answer does not depend on @xmath11 , and is the same for any complex parameter @xmath1 of infinite multiplicative order .",
    "this is no longer the case if one considers the hecke algebra @xmath0 with @xmath1 a primitive @xmath2th root of 1 .",
    "according to a conjecture of vigneras @xcite , the solution of the problem in this case would be relevant for the @xmath13-modular representation theory of @xmath7 , where @xmath13 is a prime different from @xmath14 , and @xmath2 is the multiplicative order of @xmath11 in the field with @xmath13 elements .    in this paper , we obtain results similar to those of moeglin and waldspurger in the root of unity case .",
    "namely , ( i ) given a simple @xmath0-module @xmath15 , we describe in section  5.2 a simple combinatorial algorithm for computing the isomorphism class @xmath16 $ ] of the simple module obtained by twisting with @xmath12 , and ( ii ) we prove in section  5.3 that the geometric description conjectured by zelevinsky still holds in this case , this time in terms of the @xmath3-graded nilpotent orbits parametrizing the simple @xmath0-modules .    however , our methods are different from those of @xcite ( and thus we obtain new proofs of these results in the non root of unity case ) .",
    "our main tool is a recent theorem of ariki @xcite which relates the grothendieck groups of the algebras @xmath0 with the enveloping algebra @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the kac - moody algebra of type @xmath19 if @xmath1 has order @xmath2 , and @xmath20 if @xmath1 has infinite order . using this result",
    ", we show that our problem is equivalent to describing the natural 2-fold symmetry of kashiwara s crystal graph of @xmath21 , induced by the root diagram automorphism exchanging the simple roots @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "then the combinatorial algorithm for @xmath16 $ ] follows immediately from the explicit description of this graph ( theorem  [ th1 ] ) , and the equivalent formulation in terms of nilpotent orbits is deduced from a geometric construction of the crystal basis conjectured by lusztig @xcite and recently verified by kashiwara and saito @xcite .",
    "we note that procter @xcite and aubert @xcite have established independently that the first conjecture of zelevinsky holds for the whole category of complex smooth representations of finite length of @xmath7 . assuming this hypothesis , moeglin and walspurger had already shown in @xcite that their geometric and combinatorial descriptions of zelevinsky s duality were also valid for this larger class of representations .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sect2 ]",

    "this allows us to describe the crystal graph of @xmath21 in lusztig s parametrization by nilpotent orbits , and to derive the combinatorial description of @xmath12 ( 5.2 ) .",
