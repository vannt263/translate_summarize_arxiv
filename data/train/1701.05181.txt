    "i_c(0 ) [ 1 - ( t / t_c)^2]^3/2 [ bardeen ] for the critical ( depairing ) current as a function of the temperature . an important development subsequent to bardeen s article has been little s work @xcite , which emphasized the role of large thermal fluctuations ( phase slips ) as a cause for transition to the normal state at currents below @xmath0 . experimental studies of this switching transition have developed fast in recent years .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "a study of thermal phase slips begins with identifying the saddle - point of the free energy ( the critical droplet ) that determines the activation barrier .",
    "a number of models have been used for this purpose .",
    "the original computation @xcite of langer and ambegaokar ( la ) was in the context of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) theory .",
    "the gl theory is well motivated microscopically but is limited to a vicinity of the critical temperature .",
    "one alternative may be to use a discrete model  essentially , a chain of josephson junctions .",
    "relevance of such models to nanowires has been discussed in .    here , we proceed with a continuum description and present results for activation energies obtained by a direct numerical solution of the one - dimensional usadel equation @xcite .",
    "the latter arises as the dirty - limit reduction of the eilenberger - larkin - ovchinnikov theory @xcite .",
    "it is well motivated microscopically , applies at any temperature , and contains the gl theory as a limit .",
    "usadel s equation is second - order in spatial derivatives and requires boundary conditions .",
    "let us say a few words about those .",
    "bardeen s formula ( [ bardeen ] ) pertains to a uniform superconducting state : the current density and the gap are the same everywhere along the wire ( which is assumed here to be in the @xmath1 direction ) .",
    "if the wire is connected by leads into an external circuit , such a uniform state can only be an idealization , the more so the shorter the wire is .",
    "the true equilibrium in this case is necessarily @xmath1-dependent .",
    "such @xmath1-dependent solutions have been found for very short wires ( bridges of length @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the coherence length ) , both in the gl theory @xcite and on the basis of the usadel equation @xcite . in principle , the numerical approach we describe here can be used to find such solutions also for longer wires , provided one is willing to do some modeling of physics in the leads .",
    "another aspect of the boundary conditions , which is particularly relevant to a study of phase slips , is whether the leads prevent rapid changes in the boundary values of the phase of the order parameter ( as bulk superconductors do ) or allow such changes to occur easily ( the case , for instance , for normal contacts ) . in the first case",
    ", the critical droplet does not have to have the same value of the current as the equilibrium state from which it originates , while in the second case it typically does .",
    ", where @xmath4 is the kinetic inductance ( which is small for a large superconductor ) , and @xmath5 is the capacitance of ( a portion of ) the lead relative to the ground .",
    "the two impedances shunt the ends of the wire , allowing the current in it to fluctuate . ] for long wires , the two scenarios are not that different ( as shown by mccumber @xcite in the case of the la saddle point ) , but for shorter wires there is a genuine difference , reflecting the difference in the experimental setup .",
    "we refer to the first scenario as nucleation at a fixed winding number , and to the second as nucleation at a fixed current .",
    "the simplest system in which nucleation of the droplet occurs at a fixed winding number , rather than a fixed current , is a superconducting ring .",
    "one facet of that simplicity is that , for a ring of a uniform cross section , there is a uniform equilibrium state regardless of the length .",
    "this fortuitously circumvents the problem of finding the @xmath1-dependent equilibrium characteristic of short wires in the presence of leads .",
    "in particular , results for a ring of a finite length can be directly compared to the predictions of bardeen s formula ( [ bardeen ] ) , and a correction factor to ( [ bardeen ] ) can be obtained . with this in mind , we have chosen the ring geometry for the present study . to treat the winding number as a continuous variable , we consider twisted boundary conditions , such as would arise in the presence of a fractional magnetic flux through the ring .",
    "after some preliminaries in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] , we discuss details of the boundary conditions in sec .",
    "[ sec : bc ] and then describe the numerical results in sec .  [",
    "sec : num ] . here , we present in advance the main result : the metastability chart ( fig .  [ fig : chart ] ) , which shows level contours of the activation free energy = f(droplet ) - f(uniform ) [ fact ] for the critical droplet mediating transition from the uniform equilibrium with given values of the temperature and current to the state with one fewer unit of winding .",
    "when @xmath6 is expressed as a multiple of the free energy unit ( [ f_0 ] ) , the metastability chart depends on only two parameters : the length @xmath7 of the ring and the effective electron - electron coupling @xmath8 . for the typical weak - coupling case @xmath9 , the dependence of @xmath6 on the coupling is rather weak .     for a critical droplet nucleating from a uniform equilibrium , as a function of the equilibrium current @xmath10 and the temperature .",

    "the levels of @xmath6 increase down and correspond to even ( solid lines ) or odd ( dashed lines ) multiples of 0.02 ( the innermost curve being for @xmath12 ) .",
    "the thick dashed line corresponds to the ring biased by half the flux quantum .",
    "below that line , the uniform state is absolutely stable , and the droplet represents a fluctuation towards a uniform state with a higher free energy .",
    "the results are for a ring of half - length @xmath13 in units of the diffusion length ( [ bxi ] ) .",
    "the effective coupling is @xmath14 .",
    ", width=326 ]    for a uniform ring , the properties of the equilibrium state do not depend on @xmath7 , but those of the critical droplet do .",
    "one might expect that , as @xmath7 becomes large compared to a suitably defined coherence length @xmath15 , @xmath6 approaches the constant value corresponding to an infinite wire , with finite - size corrections of order @xmath16 . that is true over most of the chart but not in a narrow band of currents near the critical .",
    "the reason is that the size of the droplet grows for currents near @xmath17 , so even for a small @xmath16 there is a range of currents for which finite - size effects are important . in what follows , we will often quote the length in units of the diffusion length @xmath18 , defined by eq .",
    "( [ bxi ] ) below . to estimate the significance of finite - size effects on @xmath6",
    ", we can compare the results for @xmath19 , which is the value used for the chart of fig .",
    "[ fig : chart ] , to those for about twice the length , @xmath20 .",
    "we concentrate on temperatures @xmath21 and currents @xmath22 , where thermal switching transitions are typically observed .",
    "more specifically , we consider the `` observability line '' @xmath23 ( which lies in the middle of the second metastability band in fig .",
    "[ fig : chart ] ) . we have found that , for these ranges of the parameters , increasing the length to @xmath20 leads to a decrease in @xmath6 by about 20% .    we should remark that , at a finite @xmath7 , the critical ( maximum ) current @xmath17 , represented by the thick upper curve in fig .  [ fig : chart ] , does not coincide with the bifurcation current @xmath24 , at which the droplet merges with the uniform solution and the activation barrier disappears .",
    "the two would be strictly the same only in the @xmath25 limit .",
    "the separation between @xmath24 and @xmath17 is possible because the value of the current does not define the uniform solution uniquely : the winding number does . as we increase the winding from zero , the current first increases until it reaches the maximum , @xmath17 , where @xmath6 is still nonzero , and then decreases down to @xmath24 , where @xmath6 finally vanishes .",
    "the value of @xmath7 chosen for fig .",
    "[ fig : chart ] , however , is already large enough for the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath26 to be unnoticeable on the scale of the plot .",
    "we return to discussion of this point in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] , where results for a smaller length are presented .    for a uniform ring",
    ", the equilibrium solution continues to exist even after the winding number @xmath27 is increased beyond the bifurcation point @xmath28 , although it becomes absolutely unstable .",
    "one may ask if this property is generic and will hold also for a wire connected to leads . in general , we consider that unlikely : as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : top ] , the persistence of the equilibrium solution for a ring can be seen as a consequence of the translational invariance .",
    "( more generally , is can be seen as a consequence of there being different `` versions '' of the critical droplet that are degenerate in free energy . )",
    "it would nevertheless be interesting to see if there are any distinct physical consequences of such absolutely unstable solutions : on the one had , fabricating a suitable ring sample may not be out of question ; on the other , for a wire connected to leads , there is an approximate translation symmetry in the middle , so the same consequences may show up in that case as well .",
    "usadel s equation @xcite can be obtained by variation of a certain free energy functional , which is essentially that of an @xmath29 nonlinear sigma model .",
    "the corresponding free energy density is    = + 2 t n(0 ) _",

    "note that the summations over @xmath37 in ( [ fren ] ) and ( [ scons ] ) are restricted to @xmath40 .",
    "if one wishes to pursue the sigma - model context , one can think of @xmath34 and @xmath35 as the in - plane and out - of - plane components of a ( fictitious ) magnetization , and of the superconducting gap @xmath33 as the in - plane component of the self - consistent fictitious magnetic field .",
    "the parameters appearing in ( [ fren ] ) are as follows : @xmath41 is the electron - electron coupling , @xmath42 is the temperature , @xmath43 is the density of states at the fermi level ( for a single spin projection ) , and @xmath44 is the electron diffusion constant .",
    "following @xcite , we will use the substitution = + _ k = 0^k - 1 [ eilen ] to relate @xmath8 to the critical temperature .",

    "becomes f^ * f = ( - i q ) ^ * ( + i q ) , [ grad_tf ] and the nonlinear constraint becomes ||^2 + g^2 = 1 .",
    "[ nonlin ] in what follows , we consider @xmath50 , rather than @xmath34 , as the main dynamical variable and @xmath49 as a parameter , on which the free energy depends explicitly via ( [ grad_tf ] ) .",
    "we begin by considering the theory on a ring of length @xmath7 , with periodic conditions on @xmath51 for all @xmath37 .",
    "later , we will allow for twisted boundary conditions , such as those associated with a magnetic flux through the ring .    for our purposes , it is not sufficient to simply state that the solution is periodic .",
    "for one thing , because of the perfect translational invariance , any @xmath1-dependent solution will have a translational zero mode ( a zero eigenvalue of the hessian matrix ) , which will render the numerical method we use inapplicable . the same applies to the zero mode generated by the symmetry of with respect to global phase rotations .",
    "we wish to eliminate these zero modes by placing the `` core '' of the solution at a particular point ( say , @xmath52 ) and also fixing its overall phase .",
    "we first note that the free energy is invariant under the discrete transformation p : f(x , ) f^*(-x , ) .",
    "[ p ] to eliminate the zero modes , we concentrate on solutions that have definite parity under @xmath53 .",
    "it is then sufficient to consider only @xmath53-odd solutions , namely those that satisfy f(x , ) = - f^*(-x , ) , [ odd ] because any @xmath53-even solution can be turned into a @xmath53-odd one by multiplication by @xmath54 .",
    "the condition ( [ odd ] ) breaks the translational symmetry to translation by @xmath55 , and the symmetry with respect to global phase rotations to multiplication by @xmath56",
    ". these are discrete symmetries , which do not produce zero modes .",
    "as an example of how ( [ odd ] ) fixes the overall phase , consider one of the uniform solutions , which are of the form f(x , ) = f ( ) e^iq x , [ uni ] where @xmath57 is a parameter .",
    "for this to satisfy ( [ odd ] ) , @xmath58 must be purely imaginary .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] , we have defined a new field @xmath50 , obtained from @xmath34 by taking out some of the winding , cf .",
    "( [ tf ] ) .",
    "the amount of winding taken out is represented by @xmath59 , where @xmath49 has so far been left undetermined . regardless of the value of @xmath49 , the condition ( [ odd ] ) translates into the identical condition for @xmath50 or , in terms of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath50 , into the condition that @xmath60 is odd , and @xmath10 is even about @xmath52 . in other words , r(0 , ) = i(0 , ) = 0 , [ bc0 ] where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "as long as @xmath51 is periodic , the condition ( [ odd ] ) implies that it is odd also under @xmath53 combined with a translation by the total length @xmath7 , that is f(x , ) = - f^*(l - x , ) .",
    "[ odd_l ] we now choose @xmath49 so that @xmath50 , on the contrary , is even under this combination : ( x , ) = ^*(l - x , ) . [ even ] in terms of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath50 , this becomes r(l/2 , ) = i(l/2 , ) = 0 .",
    "[ bcj ] for a periodic @xmath34 , the restriction this imposes on @xmath49 is @xmath61 .",
    "we observe , however , that we now have enough boundary conditions to formulate a boundary problem on @xmath62 $ ] directly for @xmath50 ( or , equivalently , for its real and imaginary parts ) , so we can switch to more general twisted @xmath34 simply by abandoning the restriction , i.e. , by allowing for arbitrary values of @xmath49 . in this way",
    ", @xmath49 becomes a continuous parameter , which enters the calculation only through the expression ( [ grad_tf ] ) for the gradient term .",
    "next , we note that , for a given @xmath49 , the boundary conditions ( [ bc0 ] ) and ( [ bcj ] ) still do not determine the solution uniquely .",
    "the reason is that the configuration space is comprised of sectors corresponding to different winding numbers , and one can in principle look for a solution to the boundary problem in each of these sectors individually .",
    "for example , for the uniform solutions ( [ uni ] ) , ( , x ) = f ( ) e^i ( q - q ) x , [ uni_tf ] and the boundary conditions require only that @xmath57 belongs to the discrete set q = q_m = q + , [ qm ] where @xmath63 is any integer .",
    "the uniform states corresponding to different @xmath64 in general have different energies , and their activated decays are described by different critical droplets .",
    "we want to make sure that we are solving for the right droplet , the one that describes the decay of a particular uniform state . in other words",
    ", we want to be able to restrict to one particular sector out of many .    loosely speaking",
    ", the different sectors can be viewed as neighborhoods of different uniform solutions , those with different @xmath57 from the sequence ( [ qm ] ) .",
    "more precisely , separation into sectors can be done with the help of the winding number w ( ) = _ -l/2^l/2 _ x f(x , ) dx , [ w ] which is well defined for any configuration for which the absolute value @xmath65 does not vanish anywhere . as indicated in ( [ w ] ) , _ a priori _ one can imagine the winding number to be a function of @xmath37 , but here we restrict attention to solutions for which it is the same for all @xmath37 , @xmath66 .    for a uniform solution , @xmath67 .",
    "we can scan over all uniform solutions by fixing @xmath63 in ( [ qm ] ) and varying @xmath49 , and we now wish to concentrate on the sector with @xmath68 , for which q = q + . [ q ] recalling that by virtue of ( [ bc0 ] ) @xmath69 is purely imaginary , we find the real and imaginary parts of ( [ uni_tf ] ) to be r(x , ) & = & - ( f ) , [ uni_r ] + i(x , ) & = & ( f ) . [ uni_i ] these expressions reflect the characteristic property of the @xmath68 sector : the real part of @xmath50 has no zeroes except the one at the origin , prescribed by ( [ bc0 ] ) , and in addition , at @xmath1 just above zero , the signs of the real and imaginary parts are opposite .",
    "indeed , for a given @xmath49 , any field that has these properties and satisfies the boundary conditions ( [ bc0 ] ) and ( [ bcj ] ) will have the same winding number as the uniform solution ( [ uni_r])([uni_i ] ) . this can be seen from the following relation , which applies whenever @xmath60 has no zeroes at @xmath70 : @xmath71 = q l -   .",
    "[ same_w ] unlike the relative sign of @xmath60 and @xmath10 , their overall sign is unimportant : there is a companion set of solutions , with the same energy and current , that differ from the ones we find by an overall sign . as already noted after ( [ odd ] ) , this is a remnant of the original invariance with respect to global phase rotations .",
    "so , in what follows we identify the @xmath68 sector by the condition r(x , ) > 0 , x > 0 .",
    "[ rpos ] eq .",
    "( [ same_w ] ) then shows that a solution ( uniform or not ) will be in the @xmath68 sector if @xmath72 and in the @xmath73 sector if @xmath72 .",
    "let us note that the critical droplet responsible for fluctuations out of the @xmath68 sector can itself be in either @xmath68 or @xmath73 sector , depending on the sign of @xmath49 . to see that , let us first consider the special case @xmath74 .",
    "for the uniform solution , eq .",
    "( [ q ] ) now gives @xmath75 , so the winding number is @xmath76 .",
    "the uniform solution with one fewer unit of winding ( corresponding to @xmath73 ) has @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "these solutions have exactly opposite currents and equal energies .",
    "if we think of the twisted boundary conditions as being a result of a magnetic flux through the ring , this special situation corresponds to the ring biased by half the flux quantum .",
    "the critical droplet in this case has @xmath79 identically , and the current on it is zero ; because of the zero of @xmath34 at @xmath80 , the winding number is not well defined .",
    "one can say that for @xmath74 the droplet lies at the boundary between the @xmath68 and @xmath73 sectors .",
    "recall that , in our computation , @xmath49 is a parameter that can be chosen arbitrarily . as we change it from positive to negative , @xmath81 changes from negative to positive , and the droplet moves from the @xmath68 sector to @xmath73 .",
    "the underlying physics is that , at @xmath82 , the @xmath68 uniform solution is metastable , and the droplet describes its activated decay to the @xmath73 solution , which has a lower free energy . at @xmath74 , the @xmath68 and @xmath73 uniform solutions become degenerate in energy , and at @xmath83 the situation is reversed : for sufficiently small @xmath84 , the @xmath68 solution is absolutely stable , and the droplet describes the decay of the @xmath73 solution to it . alternatively , even for @xmath85 , the droplet can be interpreted as a fluctuation out of the @xmath68 sector . in that interpretation , its activation energy @xmath6 will always be counted from the free energy of the @xmath68 uniform solution .",
    "this is how it has been presented on the chart of fig .",
    "[ fig : chart ] , where the states corresponding to @xmath74 are shown by the thick dashed line .",
    "the sign condition ( [ rpos ] ) , together with the boundary conditions ( [ bc0 ] ) and ( [ bcj ] ) , completes our formulation of the boundary problem for @xmath50 . note that this boundary problem produces only half of the configuration , namely , the part corresponding to @xmath86 . the other half can be obtained by reflecting @xmath87 as odd and @xmath88 as even about @xmath52 .",
    "before we proceed to the results , let us discuss some aspects of the substitution formula ( [ eilen ] ) that are important for numerical work . because @xmath8 is constant , the cutoff integer @xmath45 in ( [ eilen ] )",

    "the weak dependence of the result on @xmath89 means that , for weak coupling , the correction factor is essentially universal .    one may observe that the correction factor retains a significant dependence on @xmath42 even at the lowest temperatures : it grows by almost 2% between @xmath114 and @xmath117 .",
    "this dependence , however , is almost entirely due to that in bardeen s expression @xmath116^{3/2}$ ] .",

    "( [ k_d ] ) or table  [ tab ] . , width=326 ]    next , we consider what happens to the uniform solution when @xmath49 is increased past @xmath121 , i.e. , past the value at which the current reaches the maximum . as a point of comparison , we recall results for the theory of a single degree of freedom ( dof ) , that is , a `` particle '' with a potential in the form of a cubic parabola , as used for instance in studies of josephson junctions .",
    "the minimum of the potential corresponds to the ground state , and the maximum to the critical droplet . in that case , the maximum current is , at the same time , a bifurcation point at which the droplet merges with the ground state .    turning to the present case , note that , for a uniform solution , the current is proportional to the derivative of free energy density with respect to @xmath49 , @xmath122 .",
    "thus , @xmath123 , at which the current is maximal , is an inflection point of @xmath124 .",
    "for an infinite wire , the standard convexity argument then guarantees that at @xmath123 the uniform solution becomes unstable to spinodal decomposition .",
    "finite - size effects can delay onset of the instability , so for a wire of a finite length we expect that it occurs , if at all , at some @xmath125 .    as for a single dof ,",
    "the change in the stability properties ( now at @xmath126 ) is accompanied by a bifurcation  a merging or splitting up of two or more solutions . in our case , the solution merging with the uniform state is the critical droplet ; the process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : merge ] .",
    "note that , unlike for a singe dof , the uniform solution continues to exist at @xmath127 , even though it becomes absolutely unstable . as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : top ] , this can be attributed to the fact that there are two `` variants '' of the critical droplet , both merging with the uniform solution at @xmath126 .",
    "they are related by a discrete transformation which is a symmetry of the theory and so have the same free energy and current .    ) for the uniform solution ( solid line ) and the critical droplet ( dashed line ) , as a function of the winding number parameter @xmath49 , for @xmath128 , @xmath91 , and @xmath129 .",
    "this plot illustrates the separation between the critical value @xmath121 , where the current is maximal , and the bifurcation point @xmath130 , where the solutions merge .",
    ", width=326 ]      the critical droplet is the saddle point of the free energy that sits at the top of the potential barrier separating the uniform solution ( [ uni ] ) with @xmath131 , as given by ( [ q ] ) , from the uniform solution with one fewer unit of winding , i.e. , @xmath132 .    the droplet is @xmath1-dependent , so finding it requires solving the full eq .  ( [ usad ] ) .",
    "numerically , we proceed by discretizing ( [ usad ] ) on a one - dimensional spatial grid of @xmath133 equally spaced sites ( typically , @xmath134 or @xmath135 ) and applying the multidimensional newton - raphson ( nr ) method to the resulting nonlinear equations for @xmath136 complex unknowns @xmath137 . as usual , the success of the nr method depends on having a good initial approximation .",
    "we adopt the following protocol .",
    "we start at a value of @xmath45 close to @xmath89 , which corresponds to @xmath42 close to @xmath93 .",
    "there , we use the la solution @xcite of the gl theory as the initial approximation for the gap @xmath138 , from which we reconstruct an approximation for @xmath139 via f_gl(x,_k ) = + - [ fgl ] ( the usual approximation for transitioning from the usadel equation to the gl theory ) .",
    "after the nr method finds the exact solution at this value of @xmath45 , we compute the exact @xmath138 and increase @xmath45 to a larger value , using ( [ fgl ] ) to populate the missing modes of @xmath34 ( those with @xmath39 between the old value of @xmath45 and the new one ) . that forms the initial approximation at the new @xmath45 . in this way , increasing @xmath45 in steps , we move to progressively lower values of the temperature .    results of the computations have been already presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : chart ] and [ fig : merge ] .",
    "in addition to the symmetry under the discrete transformation ( [ p ] ) , the free energy is invariant , at an arbitrary fixed @xmath49 , under the transformation p : ( x , ) -i ^*(l/2 - x , ) .",
    "[ p ] this can be seen as a composition of ( [ p ] ) with a translation by @xmath55 and a global phase rotation . in terms of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath50",
    ", it corresponds to r(x , ) & & - i(l/2 - x , ) , [ tran_r ] + i(x , ) & & - r(l/2 - x , ) , [ tran_i ] the boundary conditions ( [ bc0 ] ) and ( [ bcj ] ) are also invariant under @xmath140 .",
    "indeed , this symmetry can be viewed as a discrete remnant of the full transitional invariance that the theory had before we imposed ( [ bc0 ] ) and ( [ bcj ] ) . as such ,",
    "it is characteristic of the rather special situation presented by a uniform ring and is not available generically .",
    "the uniform solution ( [ uni_r])([uni_i ] ) is invariant under @xmath140 , but the critical droplet is not .",
    "thus , there must be a twin droplet , with the exact same values of the free energy and current as the original , obtainable from it by an application of @xmath140 .",
    "the only physical difference between the two is that the `` core '' of the original droplet is at @xmath80 , while the core of the twin has been shifted to @xmath141 .",
    "one consequence of the existence of the twin is that , at the bifurcation point , there are in fact not two but three solutions merging .",
    "thus , for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig : merge ] , the dashed line should now be taken to mean two solutions : the original droplet and the twin .",
    "an index theorem can then be used to relate the properties of the solutions before and after the bifurcation .",
    "the argument is parallel to that used in to study bifurcation of a different type of solution , the periodic instanton @xcite .",
    "the requisite index theorem is the morse equality @xcite , which states that , for a smooth function @xmath69 with non - degenerate critical points on a compact smooth manifold @xmath142 , _",
    "s n_s ( -1)^s = ( m ) , [ index ] where the sum is over all the values of the index ( the number of negative modes of @xmath69 at a critical point ) , @xmath143 is the number of critical points of index @xmath144 , and @xmath145 is the euler characteristic of @xmath142 . in our case , @xmath142 is the product of @xmath136 spheres of the form ( [ nonlin ] ) , and @xmath69 is the discretized version of the free energy with the self - consistency condition ( [ scons ] ) and the expression ( [ grad_tf ] ) substituted in . as a result , @xmath69 depends on @xmath49 as a parameter .",
    "the critical points are , in our case , the various static solutions described earlier . assuming that no bifurcations except the one in question occur at @xmath126",
    ", we can compute the change in the right - hand side of ( [ index ] ) between @xmath146 and @xmath127 .",
    "that change must be zero , as @xmath145 is a topological invariant . at @xmath146 , there are three solutions : the uniform solution of index 0 , and the droplet with its twin , each of index 1 . their total contribution to ( [ index ] ) is @xmath56 .",
    "this is different from the case of a single dof ( the cubic parabola ) , where only two solutions are merging , and the total index is zero . in that case",
    ", the two solutions can simply disappear at @xmath147 . in our case ,",
    "the minimal structure needed at @xmath148 to preserve the total index is a single solution with one negative mode .",
    "that is indeed what we have seen numerically : the uniform solution remains but becomes absolutely unstable .",
    "it is natural to ask where the instability that the uniform solution acquires at @xmath127 leads .",
    "numerically , this can be answered by displacing a little along the negative mode and following a relaxation algorithm . to better describe the results ,",
    "let us first recall that , in addition to the now unstable uniform solution , which we will call @xmath149 , there are , for the same @xmath49 , uniform solutions with other winding numbers .",
    "for the solution with one unit of winding fewer than @xmath149 , the real and imaginary parts of @xmath50 are r(x , ) & = & g ( ) , + i(x , ) & = & g ( ) .",
    "the difference with ( [ uni_r])([uni_i ] ) is that @xmath60 and @xmath10 now have the same sign for @xmath70 .",
    "there are in fact two solutions of this form : one with @xmath150 , and the other with @xmath151 ; let us call them @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "the transformation ( [ tran_r])([tran_i ] ) maps one into the other .",
    "numerically , we have found that the instability of @xmath149 at @xmath127 develops into @xmath152 or @xmath153 , depending on the direction of the initial displacement .",
    ", goes up to @xmath149 , and then down back to @xmath154 . ]",
    "finally , we remark that , as @xmath49 is increased further , beyond @xmath130 , the uniform solution acquires additional negative modes and so is expected to go through additional bifurcation points .",
    "we have not studied those in any detail .",
