    "recently , an ultraviolet ( uv ) completion of general relativity , motivated by the lifshitz theory in the condensed matter physics  @xcite , has been proposed by hoava  @xcite .",
    "the hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) gravity is established as a power - counting renormalizable theory at the cost of the violation of the lorentz symmetry , which is responsible for the fact that the hl theory is not invariant under the full diffeomorphism group of general relativity but under its subgroup , called the foliation - preserving diffeomorphism .",
    "however , the full diffeomorphism is somehow recovered in the infrared ( ir ) limit , though a mechanism for recovering the full diffeomorphism or the renormalization group flow is yet unsolved issue .",
    "the hl gravity has been intensively studied in the area of black hole physics  @xcite and cosmology  @xcite .    on the other hand , a spacetime wormhole is a widely known object providing a conceivable method for rapid interstellar travel . in 1988 ,",
    "morris and thorne studied traversable wormholes in a realistic manner  @xcite .",
    "they pointed out some problems of schwarzschild wormholes to be used for interstellar travel and listed the desired properties that traversable wormholes should possess .",
    "one important property for traversable wormholes is obviously that there should be no horizon , since it would prevent two - way travel , which is actually a critical problem of schwarzschild wormholes .",
    "considering matter sources , we can get rid of the horizon out of the geometry , though the matter which is needed to make wormholes traversable violates ( some of ) the desired energy conditions .",
    "this kind of matter is called the _ exotic",
    "_ matter .    motivated by the fact that the higher curvature terms in hl cosmology can make negative contributions to energy density  @xcite",
    ", we are trying to see if they can also play the role of exotic matters . in this respect",
    ", we will find traversable wormhole solutions in hl gravity , considering the `` detailed balance '' condition ( dbc ) with ir modification .",
    "the deformed hl gravity is considered because the asymptotic flatness requires the ir modification to hl theory , which was a key to have an asymptotically flat solution known as kehagias - sfetsos ( ks ) black hole  @xcite . in the deformed hl gravity , however , it turns out that the exotic sources are still needed , and the higher curvature contributions are not exotic at all .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "we catch a glimpse of hl gravity and ks vacuum in sec .",
    "[ sec : hl ] .",
    "then , the energy densities and pressures are obtained for the matter source and the higher curvature contribution in sec .",
    "[ sec : exotic ] , where it turns out that the higher curvature terms can not play the role of exotic source , considering the flaring - out condition . in sec .",
    "[ sec : traversable ] , some conditions for traversable wormholes are found and three types of wormhole solutions are examined . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , some comments and discussion will be given .",
    "considering arnowitt - deser - misner decomposition of the metric with @xmath0  @xcite and an anisotropic scaling between time and space , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the hl gravity of @xmath3 with the _ softly _ broken dbc is given by  @xcite @xmath4 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 $ ] is the extrinsic curvature at @xmath6 hypersurface , and the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time @xmath7 . here ,",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the metric , the intrinsic curvature , and the covariant derivative in the three - dimensional hypersurface , respectively . in addition",
    ", @xmath11 is the cotton - york tensor defined by @xmath12 @xmath13 is a coupling related to the newton constant @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is an additional dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "note that @xmath16 represents the ir modification which is essential to have asymptotically flat solutions .",
    "the coupling constants @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 come from the three - dimensional euclidean topologically massive gravity action  @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the gravitational chern - simons term .",
    "then , the scaling of couplings can be obtained as @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "note that identifying the fundamental constants with @xmath27 the einstein - hilbert action can be recovered in the ir limit with @xmath28 : @xmath29 \\\\    & = \\frac{c^2}{16\\pi g_n } \\int dt d^3x \\sqrt{g } n \\left [ k_{ij } k^{ij } - k^2 + c^2 \\left ( r - 2\\lambda \\right ) \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the metric and curvature scalar of four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "so , we will assume @xmath28 to keep the einstein limit and @xmath32 to consider an asymptotically flat spacetime .",
    "then , the hl action   can be split by @xmath33 for the purpose of considering @xmath34 as contributions to matter - energy in what follows and eventually investigating the possibility to get a traversable wormhole without any external exotic sources .",
    "now , varying the total action @xmath35 with a static , spherically symmetric metric ansatz , @xmath36 the equations of motion are obtained as @xmath37 = t^{rr } , \\label{eom : r } \\\\ & -\\frac{4c^2}{\\kappa^2r^4 } \\left [ \\frac12 r ( f / r ) ' - r \\left ( r - f \\right ) \\left ( \\phi'^2 + \\phi '' \\right ) - \\left ( r - f - \\frac12 r^2 ( f / r ) ' \\right ) \\phi ' \\right ] = t^{\\theta\\theta } = t^{\\phi\\phi } \\sin^2 \\theta , \\label{eom : theta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 are the total stress - energy tensors and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath39 . here , the higher curvature contributions of them are derived as @xmath40 , \\\\",
    "t_\\text{hc}^{\\theta\\theta } = & t_\\text{hc}^{\\phi\\phi } \\sin^2 \\theta \\notag \\\\",
    "= & -\\frac{\\kappa^2\\mu^2}{16r^5 } \\left [ f \\left ( \\frac{f}{r^2 } \\right ) ' + \\frac{2f}{r } \\left ( r - f",
    "\\right ) \\left ( \\phi'^2 + \\phi '' - \\phi ' \\right ) - \\left ( \\frac{f}{r } \\right ) ' ( -2r+3f ) \\phi ' \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the higher curvature terms do not contain the parameter @xmath19 , because the above spherically symmetric metric ansatz makes the cotton - york tensor vanish .",
    "so , in some sense , the static , spherically symmetric metric reduces our model to effectively hl gravity of @xmath41 .",
    "since the traversable wormhole is known to be accompanied by the so - called exotic matter in general relativity ( gr ) , the flaring - out condition for the shape of wormholes is introduced to see if the external source and the higher curvature terns are exotic or not . following ref .",
    "@xcite , to study the wormhole geometry , we embed a slice of @xmath42 and @xmath43 in an axially symmetric euclidean space : @xmath44 then , we have a relation for the embedding function of @xmath45 , and the wormhole throat is defined as the minimum radius @xmath46 at which its embedded surface is vertical , _ i.e. _ @xmath47 diverges as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : embed ] , so that @xmath48 .",
    "now , a flaring - out condition @xmath49 should be required near the throat : @xmath50 so that @xmath51 should be a decreasing function at least near the throat and eventually vanish as @xmath52 due to the asymptotic flatness .    next , to see if the higher curvature terms can play the role of the exotic matter , a dimensionless function is defined as  @xcite @xmath53 if @xmath54 , then the energy density is less than the tension so that a certain energy condition should be violated . in this manner , a matter provided by @xmath54 is called an exotic matter .",
    "now , the energy density and pressure contributions are obtained from @xmath55 as @xmath56 , \\\\",
    "p_\\text{hc } = & \\frac{r}{2 } \\left [ ( \\rho_\\text{hc}-\\tau_\\text{hc})\\phi ' - \\tau_\\text{hc } ' \\right ] - \\tau_\\text{hc},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the energy density , the radial tension , and the lateral pressure , respectively .",
    "it is obvious that the higher curvature contribution to the energy density is positive if @xmath60 .",
    "then , the exotic function for the higher curvature contribution is given by @xmath61 note that the finiteness of @xmath57 yields @xmath62 , and if @xmath63 near the throat , then the flaring - out condition reads @xmath64 near @xmath65 , which means the higher curvature terms is not exotic at least near the throat . indeed , let @xmath66 with @xmath67 , then @xmath68 goes to @xmath69 as @xmath39 goes down to @xmath46 for @xmath70 , so that the lapse function @xmath71 vanishes .",
    "the vanishing lapse function reports that there is a horizon , which forbids two - way travel .",
    "since we want to find a two - way traversable wormhole , @xmath72 should be less than one and @xmath63 so that the higher curvature terms can not play the role of the exotic matter .",
    "actually , a wormhole could be constructed without any matter source @xmath73 , though it is not traversable .",
    "when we remove the matter source , @xmath74 , then the solution is obtained as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are constants of integration . here , the asymptotic flatness yields @xmath78 , and then the solution is exactly the same with the ks solution as expected  @xcite .",
    "note that the exotic function of the higher curvature terms vanishes in this case , @xmath79 , which is a critical case .",
    "now , we have a ks wormhole [ fig .  [",
    "fig : embed : a ] ] , but it has a horizon at the throat like schwarzschild wormhole in gr  @xcite , which is why it is not traversable .    to check whether the external source is also exotic or not ,",
    "let us now replace the function @xmath80 by @xmath81 through the relation @xmath82 for convenience .",
    "then , @xmath83 should be positive since @xmath84 , and the energy density and pressure of the external source can be obtained from @xmath85 as @xmath86 , \\label{tau } \\\\",
    "p = & \\frac{r}{2 } \\left [ ( \\rho-\\tau)\\phi ' - \\tau ' \\right ] - \\tau.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the expressions for @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the same as those in gr up to some factor  @xcite , while @xmath89 has quite different expression , and the energy density is positive when @xmath90 .",
    "that is , the function @xmath81 should be monotonically increasing if the energy density is assumed to be positive .",
    "then , the exotic function is given by @xmath91.\\ ] ] note that the flaring - out condition tells us that the external source is exotic near the throat .",
    "in other words , the external exotic sources are still needed to make wormholes traversable in our deformed hl gravity .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , a traversable wormhole should not possess a horizon . to find a condition for it , let us introduce a new radial coordinate @xmath92 : @xmath93 with @xmath94 at the throat .",
    "note that @xmath95 reads the proper distance from the throat to @xmath39 , and the throat ( @xmath94 ) connects the upper spacetime ( @xmath96 ) with the lower spacetime ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "then , the line element is written as @xmath98 with @xmath99 by definition .",
    "now , it is explicitly seen that there should be a horizon when @xmath100 at @xmath101 . in other words",
    ", all traversable wormholes should have a finite @xmath102 for all @xmath103 .",
    "in addition , we want to find an asymptotically flat wormhole solution ; however , if @xmath104 for large @xmath39 , the asymptotic flatness can not be achieved . indeed , if @xmath105 , then @xmath106 , and if @xmath107 $ ] with a constant @xmath108 and a function @xmath109 , then @xmath110 $ ] . in both cases ,",
    "the function @xmath111 diverges , and we see that the asymptotic flatness is guaranteed only for the case of @xmath112 at large @xmath39 .",
    "now , we arrive the final condition , @xmath113 for large @xmath39 , from the asymptotic flatness , since the function @xmath111 approximates to @xmath114 . in what follows , three types of asymptotically flat , traversable wormhole solutions are suggested .",
    "+    first , we can consider a solution with an exotic source falling off rapidly as @xmath39 grows to infinity .",
    "we choose @xmath115 and @xmath116 , then we have the energy density of the exotic source as follows : @xmath117 note that the energy density of the exotic matter decays exponentially to zero as desired , but it becomes ( small ) negative for @xmath118 , though it may be positive near the throat [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : exotic : a ] ] . this kind of wormhole require an exotic matter spreading out all the spaces , which seems more or less unphysical .",
    "next , we consider a wormhole solution with an exotic source confined in a region near the throat and a ks solution in the outside . for this configuration ,",
    "we try @xmath119 $ ] and @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 and @xmath123 for @xmath124 , then the energy density has the following form : @xmath125 the energy density is positive and confined in a sphere of the radius @xmath126 , and the ks solution outside the sphere tells that @xmath127 .",
    "finally , we consider a wormhole solution with an exotic source confined in a region near the throat and a minkowski vacuum in the outside .",
    "for this case , @xmath128 $ ] for @xmath129 and @xmath130 for @xmath124 and @xmath131 are considered , then the density is given by @xmath132 the confined exotic energy is negative , and the outside region is the minkowski vacuum with @xmath133 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the exotic function of the higher curvature contribution is vanishing as @xmath39 grows to @xmath126 in the wormhole surrounded by ks vacuum [ fig .",
    "[ fig : exotic : b ] ] , while it becomes @xmath134 as @xmath39 grows to the infinity in the exponential case [ fig .",
    "[ fig : exotic : a ] ] or to @xmath126 in the wormhole surrounded by minkowski vacuum [ fig .",
    "[ fig : exotic : c ] ] . since @xmath135 for all three cases , we can rewrite the exotic function as @xmath136 .",
    "then , the vanishing exotic function in fig .  [ fig : exotic : b ] tells us that @xmath137 , which is similar to the equation of state of the vacuum energy in the cosmology , and @xmath138 in fig .",
    "[ fig : exotic : a ] and reflects @xmath139 , which becomes the equation of state of the ( dark ) matter .",
    "similarly , the exotic function of the exotic source can be written as @xmath140 for and and @xmath141 for .",
    "then , the equation of state becomes @xmath142 , since @xmath143 for and , and @xmath144 , since @xmath145 for .",
    "note that the equation of state for implies that the exotic matter is a phantom energy in this case .",
    "we have tried to build an asymptotically flat wormhole in the deformed hl gravity .",
    "first of all , the ks wormhole can be constructed without any exotic source , but it turns out to be nontraversable since it has a horizon right at the throat . requiring the absence of horizon , then , the exotic source is crucial to make a traversable wormhole at least in the deformed hl theory , since it can not be replaced by the higher curvature terms .",
    "if dbc is relaxed , however , the higher curvature contributions might play the role of the exotic source , because it has been seen that the early acceleration of the universe can be obtained without any inflaton fields in hl cosmology  @xcite .    to make this explicit , the dark radiation and the dark scalar contributions come from the higher curvature terms of the fourth order derivative and the sixth order derivative , respectively . assuming that the contribution of the dark radiation is negligible , the contribution of the dark scalar to the energy density is crucial which is actually negative , @xmath146 .",
    "this fact can be plausible at the early stage of the universe  @xcite .",
    "now , the exotic function can be written by @xmath147 , and the equation - of - state parameter for the dark scalar turns out to be @xmath148 .",
    "it naturally yields the positive @xmath149 .",
    "what it means is that the higher curvature contribution can play the role of the exotic source when the dbc is relaxed , without resorting to the external exotic matter .",
    "although this argument was not based on the explicit wormhole geometry but just the cosmological side , it gives some insight into the possibility to create the traversable wormhole at the early stage of the universe in the hl gravity .",
    "otherwise , the analytic continuation might be considered to resolve this issue .",
    "taking into account @xmath150 and @xmath151  @xcite , the potential terms in the action   take the opposite sign , and so do the energy density   and the tension  . at first sight",
    ", it seems that the matter source is no more exotic and the higher curvature terms play the role of the exotic matter with this analytic continuation .",
    "however , the relation of the speed of light   constrains @xmath152 , so that @xmath111 does not vanish in the asymptotic region ; instead , @xmath153 and @xmath154 becomes large negative for @xmath155 . to make @xmath156 positive , eq",
    "can be modified to @xmath157}$ ] , which approximates to @xmath158 .",
    "then , it has schwarzschild limit with @xmath159 .",
    "after some tedious calculations , however , the exotic function is obtained as @xmath160.\\ ] ] note that @xmath161 , so the analyses on the exotic behavior are exactly same as those in sec .",
    "[ sec : exotic ] , i.e. the matter source is still exotic .",
    "further study is needed in this issue .",
    "next , we have constructed three sorts of traversable wormholes : one is the wormhole with an exponentially decaying exotic source in the radial direction , another is the wormhole with an exotic source confined in the middle of the ks vacuum , and the other is the wormhole with an exotic source confined in the middle of the minkowski vacuum . interestingly , in the second case , the exotic source and the higher curvature contributions , respectively , behave like the phantom energy and the dark energy near the boundary of the confined region , while in the first and third cases , both the exotic source and the higher curvature contributions behave like the ( dark ) matter in the boundary .",
    "the final comment is in order .",
    "it is interesting to note that a spherically symmetric matter distribution and the corresponding higher curvature contribution satisfy the four - dimensional covariant form of energy conservation in the deformed hl gravity , @xmath162 , though it is obvious that the total energy satisfies the conservation of energy in the covariant form in four dimensions , @xmath163 , because the left - hand sides of the equations of motion   are the same as the four - dimensional einstein tensor , @xmath164 , up to the factor @xmath165 .",
    "this behavior is not supposed to be seen in hl theory if dbc is not considered at all .",
    "however , we should not say that it is due to dbc .",
    "the general covariance in matter - energy conservation deserves further investigation .",

    "<S> it turns out that higher curvature terms can not play the role of exotic matters which are crucial to form a traversable wormhole , and external exotic sources are still needed . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the exotic matter behaves like phantom energy if the kehagias - sfetsos vacuum is considered outside the wormhole . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the spherically symmetric setting makes the matter and the higher curvature contribution satisfy four - dimensional conservation of energy in the covariant form . </S>"
