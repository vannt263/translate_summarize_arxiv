    "although attempts to apply perturbative qcd to wide - angle elastic hadron scatterings have been undertaken in a number of papers [ 1 - 10 ] , explicit predictions have been available only for elastic processes involving external photons , such as @xmath16 hadrons , compton scattering of hadrons , etc .",
    "predictions based on perturbative qcd rest on three premises : 1 ) hadronic interactions become weak at small invariant separation @xmath17 ; 2 ) the perturbative expansion in @xmath18 is well - defined ; and 3 ) factorization , implying that all effects of collinear singularities , confinement , non - perturbative interactions and bound state dynamics can be isolated at large momentum transfer in terms of the ( process independent ) structure functions @xmath19 fragmentation functions @xmath20 or , in the case of exclusive processes , distribution amplitudes @xmath21 consequently the hadronic scattering amplitude takes the form @xmath22~ , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is a universal distribution amplitude which gives the probability amplitude for finding the valence @xmath24 or @xmath25 in the hadronic wave function collinear up to the scale @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the hard scattering amplitude for valence quark collisions .    the technical complication which has made particularly difficult to compute the behavior of hadron - hadron amplitudes is the possibility of multiple scatterings .",
    "the standard factorized form for the elastic scattering of hadrons @xmath28 is @xmath29\\phi_i(x_i)t(\\{x_i\\},s , t)~ , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 represents collectively the fractional momenta of hadron @xmath31 carried by its valence partons .",
    "according to this concept , all of the partons collide in a small region of the space - time of typical dimension @xmath32 .",
    "the relevant contribution to the amplitude behaves according to the dimensional counting @xcite , i.e. @xmath33 for @xmath34 partons participating in the hard scattering , @xmath35 representing hadronic mass scales , which make the amplitude dimensionless .",
    "an extension of this `` single - scattering '' scenario is the ( double ) `` independent- scattering '' picture , due to p. landshoff @xcite , in which two pairs of partons scatter independently off two scattering centers . according to this picture ,",
    "the lowest order diagrams contribute with @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of independent scatterings .",
    "if so , the multiple scattering should dominate in the case of wide angle scattering .",
    "a solution to this problem was pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , where it was shown that the sudakov logarithms associated with the rescattering diagrams do not cancel . in the leading logarithmic approximation",
    "they exponentiate to suppress the typical double scattering contribution by a factor @xmath38 characteristic of the sudakov suppression in qcd .",
    "more quantitatively @xcite , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the number of flavors .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath42 the power turns out to be @xmath43 nearly the same as the dimensional counting power @xmath44 in the single - scattering scenario .",
    "higher order diagrams were calculated e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , however soon it became evident that even the first order qcd correction involves an immense number of feynman diagrams , so further attempts to go beyond the simple quark counting rule were abandoned .",
    "it may be that perturbative qcd is not the relevant ( or not the only physically interesting ) expansion of the wide - angle scattering amplitude .",
    "recent developments in m - branes ( see e.g. ref .",
    "citepolchinski ) may open new prospects in the realization of a hypothetical duality between small and large distances ( or , equivalently , large- and small - angle scattering ) .",
    "the search for a relevant expansion parameter is of crucial importance on this way .    in this paper",
    "we are solving an `` inverse problem '' : we use the known explicit expression of the dual amplitude with mandelstam analyticity ( dama ) , that has correct wide angle scaling behavior . by identifying it with that resulting from the quark counting rules",
    ", we then calculate two sub - leading terms in the expansion of the known full dual amplitude and study the behavior of the resulting series .",
    "wide - angle scaling behavior within the @xmath45matrix approach was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where by means of a logarithmic regge trajectory an interpolation from the  soft  regge behavior to the  hard  scaling regime was suggested .",
    "the motivation of the logarithmic trajectory came from earlier papers @xcite , where a class of dual models requiring a logarithmic trajectory was suggested .",
    "the logarithmic asymptotic behavior of the trajectory and the large angle scaling behavior are uniquely related also in a different class of dual models , called dual amplitudes with mandelstam analytics ( dama ) @xcite .",
    "the link between this class of models in the scaling limit and the parton model in the infinite momentum frame was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in all those papers only the leading asymptotic ( @xmath46 ) term was treated .",
    "the results of different approaches vary in such details as the form of the scaling violation ( normally , logarithmic ) , the form of the angular dependence @xmath47 and the way active quarks are counted .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the sub - leading terms in the pre - asymptotic ( larger @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) behavior of dama . since the model is realistic enough in the sense that it satisfies the general requirements of the theory ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we believe that our result is universal and thus it may be used as a guide e. g. in qcd calculations .    apart from the leading term , we have explicitly calculated two more sub - leading terms .",
    "our technique allows further calculations of still higher orders , but the obtained first three terms of the series already show a regular trend that may be interpreted as the expansion in the running coupling constant @xmath50 valid at large @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this situation takes place for anyone trajectory with the logarithmic asymptotic .",
    "the aim of the present paper is two - fold .",
    "first , by identifying the leading term of the asymptotic ( wide - angle ) expansion of dama with that derived from perturbative qcd @xcite we tentatively assume that the dama in the wide angle asymptotic region is equivalent to the asymptotically free regime in qcd . with this identification in mind , we calculate within dama corrections to the leading term in the hope that their form may give some insight into the relevant corrections in perturbative qcd that are known to be very complicated .    clearly , the above identity has the chance to be true only in the vicinity of the wide angle region ( small distances ) , where perturbative calculations are assumed to be still valid .",
    "the second aspect is purely phenomenological .",
    "since , however , the experimental situation in the wide - angle region did not change for almost two decades , we are left with the earlier fits to the data .",
    "let us now calculate the  perturbative  expansion of dama .",
    "we write the elastic scattering amplitude for spinless particles in the following symmetric form @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a constant and @xmath53    here @xmath54 and @xmath55 is a dimensionless parameter , @xmath56",
    ". only one , leading trajectory was included and it was chosen in a simple , but representative form : @xmath57 that account both for the threshold and the asymptotic behavior and is nearly linear for very small @xmath58 for simplicity we have included only the leading trajectories in both channels : the pomeron trajectory in the @xmath59-channel and the exotic trajectory in the @xmath48-channel .",
    "while the parameters of the pomeron trajectory are well known , only a little is known about the exotic trajectory .",
    "fortunately , this has no substantial effect on our results , since our goal is the functional form of the series and its individual terms rather than fits to the data .",
    "given the scarcity of the data and the freedom available in the model , the wide - angle behavior of dama can not be determined completely .",
    "let us consider the asymptotic behavior of eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) in the limit @xmath60 for the regge trajectories we have @xmath61 @xmath62 with @xmath63 @xmath64 from here on , @xmath65 will be dimensionless variables , measured in units of @xmath66 .    in this domain",
    "the saddle point method can be used to calculate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) @xcite . to do this",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) in the following form @xmath67 where we have changed the variable @xmath68 to @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and introduced new functions : @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 we see now that @xmath74 has a sharp maximum at the saddle point @xmath75 .",
    "we quote the explicit expression for the saddle point expansion in the [ ap_coef ] . using formulas from this appendix",
    "we obtain the power series for @xmath76 in [ powerd ] .",
    "it reads @xmath77 where @xmath78 are given by the expressions ( [ b5 ] , [ b8 ] , [ b9 ] ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath79 can be calculated in a similar way ( see eq .",
    "( [ b10 ] ) in [ powerd ] ) .    in the kinematical region",
    "@xmath80 we can use the substitutions @xmath81    substituting the results for @xmath76 and @xmath79 into eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and changing the variables we get the expression for the full amplitude as a function of the @xmath48 and @xmath82 variables ( see eq .",
    "( [ b14 ] ) in [ powerd ] ) : @xmath83 where @xmath84 are given by the expressions ( [ b13 ] , [ b15 ] - [ b17 ] ) .    to summarize",
    ", we have expanded the wide - angle scattering amplitude in a power series of @xmath85 and have evaluated explicitly the coefficients of the first two terms ( beyond the leading one ) .",
    "new experimental data on wide - angle scatterings are not likely to appear any more because of the simple reason that as energy increases more particles tend to fly in the forward direction and there is no chance to detect e.g. the proton - proton differential cross section at @xmath86 for , say , @xmath87 .",
    "`` wide angles '' , of course , extend beyond @xmath86 .",
    "still the complication due to the huge number of born diagrams contributing to large angle exclusive reactions @xcite , overwhelming the contribution due to the landshoff pinch singularity @xcite , will remain for long topical in this field .",
    "we use the data given in the compilation of @xcite to fix the scale .",
    "the errors , quoted in the original papers ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , are typically about 10 overall normalization factor , the `` quark counting power '' in the cross section being set equal to @xmath88 in the case of proton - proton cross section , in agreement with the data @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "our main goal is the behavior of the scaling - violating corrections to the leading term obeying quark counting rules .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the relative contribution of these terms .",
    "we draw the correction power series : @xmath89 @xmath90 where @xmath91 are given by expressions ( [ b18 ] - [ b20 ] ) .",
    "we can see that the corrections are quite large for small @xmath48 , especially for angles close to @xmath92 .",
    "that is not a surprise , since the lowest order of our expansion is valid for large @xmath48 ( @xmath93 ) . in the experimental energy interval",
    "the corrections give factor @xmath94 to the cross sections and should not be neglected .",
    "this was missed in the references @xcite .",
    "moreover we find that the corrections are very sensitive to variations of @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "magas is thankful for the hospitality extended to him by the bogolyubov institute for theoretical physics in kiev where part of this work was done .",
    "in this appendix we present the explicit expression for the saddle point expansion from ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
