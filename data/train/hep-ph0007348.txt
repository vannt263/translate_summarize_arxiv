    "low - energy @xmath0 scattering offers the rare possibility to test a fundamental property of the qcd vacuum , the strength of quark - antiquark condensation @xmath2@xcite .",
    "the knowledge of this quantity is crucial to understand the mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown ( sb@xmath3s ) in the standard model .",
    "the quark condensate , as every other order parameter , depends on the number of massless flavors @xmath4 , and will in general experience a paramagnetic suppression as @xmath4 increases@xcite .",
    "it turns out that what can actually be measured from low - energy @xmath0 scattering is the quark condensate in the limit of two massless flavors , @xmath5 .",
    "the question to be addressed is to which extent @xmath5 is close to a critical point where @xmath2 disappears and chiral symmetry is eventually broken by higher - dimensional order parameters@xcite .",
    "the proper framework to analyze phenomenologically the issue is provided by the generalized version of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3pt)@xcite in the case of su(2)@xmath6su(2 ) chiral symmetry .",
    "this is a reorganization of the standard expansion of @xmath3pt@xcite in which the quark condensate parameter @xmath7 is considered formally as a small quantity , in order to account for the possibility that the linear and quadratic terms , in the expansion of the pion mass @xmath8 in powers of quark masses @xmath9 , be of the same order .",
    "the chiral counting is modified accordingly , @xmath10 with @xmath11 containing additional terms , relegated in higher orders by the standard counting .",
    "the complete effective lagrangian up to @xmath12 can be found in refs.@xcite , together with its renormalization at 1  loop .    at present , the low - energy @xmath0 phase - shifts are rather poorly known , but considerable improvements are expected to come soon from new high - luminosity @xmath13 decays experiments , performed at brookhaven and da@xmath14ne .",
    "these new data , together with the recent numerical solutions of roy equations@xcite , will allow to extract the two @xmath15-wave scattering lengths or , equivalently , the two parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 , introduced in ref.@xcite and representing respectively the amplitude and the slope at the symmetrical point @xmath18 . in this perspective , we have established the relationship between the two - flavor quark condensate , expressed through the deviation from the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation ,    @xmath19    and the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 , including the leading @xmath1 double logarithmic corrections to the 1-loop result of generalized @xmath3pt .",
    "due to the smallness of the pion mass , double chiral logarithms are among the potentially most dangerous contributions at order @xmath1 .",
    "as first pointed out in ref.@xcite they can be obtained from a 1-loop calculation , using the fact that , in the renormalization procedure , non - local divergences must cancel . setting the space - time dimension @xmath20 to regulate the theory , all the low - energy constants ( l.e.c.s ) of the generalized lagrangian with @xmath21 derivatives and @xmath22 powers of the scalar source , @xmath23 , have dimension @xmath24 , except @xmath25 which has dimension @xmath26=d-2 $ ] .",
    "we thus replace @xmath25 with @xmath27 , making appear explicitly the scale parameter @xmath28 brought in by the regularization procedure . since each loop involves a factor @xmath29 , the chiral expansion of a generic amplitude @xmath30 , apart from an overall dimensional factor , takes the form , @xmath31 where @xmath32 are polynomials in the l.e.c.s and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are loop - functions of the kinematical variables , expressed in terms of dimensionless quantities . after writing the laurent expansions of the loop - functions and of the coupling constants , @xmath35 and imposing the cancellation of the non - local divergences @xmath36",
