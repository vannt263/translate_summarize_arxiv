    "the last decade has seen a revolution in cosmology with the emergence of a standard model for the universe dominated by a strange substance known as  dark energy \" , with an effective negative pressure . since the first evidence of dark energy in 1998  @xcite , there has been substantial observational and theoretical research aimed at understanding the true nature of this phenomenon . in recent years , many authors have started exploring the possibility that dark energy , and the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe , could be the consequence of an incomplete theory of gravity on cosmological scales and may require modifications to einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "one of the most direct methods of testing our assumed theory of gravity is to perform consistency checks between the geometrical expansion history of the universe , as measured by cosmological probes like type ia supernovae and the baryon acoustic oscillations , and the evolution of density inhomogeneities in the universe  @xcite .",
    "the growth of structures in the universe can be measured using a variety of techniques , but a popular and direct method involves measuring the coherent peculiar velocities of galaxies on large scales ( i.e. , the motion of galaxies after the cosmological expansion has been removed ) caused by their infall into large scale overdensities like clusters and superclusters of galaxies  @xcite . traditionally , the local peculiar velocity field , or `` bulk flow '' of galaxies , has been estimated using samples of galaxies where the peculiar velocity of each galaxy has been determined using secondary distance indicators ( e.g. the tully  fisher relationship @xcite or fundamental plane @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the coherent motion , or flow , of galaxies can be statistically estimated from their effect on the clustering measurements of large redshift surveys , or through the measurement of redshift  space distortions .",
    "historically , measurements of the local galaxy peculiar velocity field have been plagued by systematic uncertainties @xcite , and small sample sizes , which have made their cosmological constraints uncompetitive compared to other probes of the universe .",
    "however , a recent re  analysis of these earlier peculiar velocity galaxy surveys  @xcite has now provided a consistent observational picture from these data , and finds significant evidence for a larger than expected bulk flow in the local universe ( within 100 @xmath10 ) .",
    "this new analysis is also consistent with new measurements of the local bulk flow using the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite of massive clusters of galaxies out to at least 800 mpc  @xcite , which leads to the intriguing situation that these local measurements appear to be significantly greater in amplitude , and on larger scales , than expected in a concordance , wmap7normalised @xmath4cdm cosmological model .",
    "such discrepancies with @xmath4cdm may give support to theories of modified gravity  @xcite .",
    "given the importance of these local large  scale bulk flow measurements , we investigated in a previous paper @xcite the likelihood of such large coherent flows using an alternative methodology based upon measurements of the redshift  space distortions seen in the clustering of a sample of galaxy clusters selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )  @xcite .",
    "we detected no statistical evidence for the coherent flows of the same size , and scale , as discussed above , but due to the sample size the statistical errors were large ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we re - visit our earlier work using a larger cosmological data  set and recent theoretical improvements in the modelling of redshift  space distortions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to statistically study the likelihood of the local bulk flow measurements within a large cosmological volume of the universe , well beyond these nearby measurements .    in section",
    "ii of this paper , we outline in greater detail the fitting techniques used in @xcite to formulate the line  of  sight smearing effect due to the coherent bulk flow of galaxies . in section iii",
    ", we explain our data analysis of a sample of sdss luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ; @xcite ) and our measurement of their two  dimensional redshift  space correlation function . in section iv",
    ", we present our results from comparing our lrg measurements to our model for redshift  space distortions , and compare our results to cosmological predictions and previous observations .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "the aim of this work is to statistically measure the coherent motion of galaxies on large scales . that is , the linear velocity of galaxies excluding both the cosmological hubble expansion and any smaller scale non  linear components .",
    "the coherent motions of galaxies introduce redshift  space distortions  an anisotropic feature  into the measured clustering statistics . as originally proposed in  @xcite",
    ", a distant observer should expect a multiplicative enhancement of the overdensity field along the line  of  sight , compared to the transverse direction , due to such coherent peculiar motion of galaxies .",
    "this  kaiser effect \" , as it is now know , can be seen as a  squashing \" or flattening of the two  dimensional two  point correlation function ( @xmath11 ) , where the correlation function is decomposed into two vectors ; one parallel to the line  of  sight ( @xmath12 ) and the other perpendicular to the line  of  sight ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "information about the coherent velocities of galaxies can then be extracted from the two  dimensional correlation function via careful theoretical modelling of these redshift  space distortion effects .    in this paper , we utilise several theoretical improvements to the original redshift  space distortion work given in  @xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we refer to the original work of  @xcite as the `` kaiser limit '' , which formulated the coherent motions of galaxies as an additional dopper shift to the cosmological redshift .",
    "the  kaiser limit \" is suitable to test theoretical models in the linear region of galaxy perturbations ( on large scales ) , but over the last decade there have been significant improvements to the modelling of these effects .",
    "below , we repeat some of the formalism presented in our first paper @xcite to aid the reader and provide continuity with additional work presented in following subsections .",
    "the observed power spectrum of density fluctuations in redshift  space , @xmath14 , can be written as , [ eq : ps ] _",
    "ob(k,)&= & + & & g(k,;_v ) , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote galaxy density and velocity fields respectively ( where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the divergence of the velocity fields ) . in eq .",
    "[ eq : ps ] , the function @xmath19 denotes the additional suppression effect due to coherent motions which affects the galaxy  galaxy , velocity  velocity and galaxy  velocity power spectra equally , and is a function of separation ( @xmath20 ) , angle between the galaxies ( denoted by @xmath21 ) and has a given smoothing scale , or velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) , which is the parameter at the heart of our analysis and this paper .",
    "as discussed in our previous paper , we can decompose these power spectra into a scale  dependent ( @xmath22 ) and scale  independent part ( @xmath23 ) given by , [ eq : pall ] p_(k , a)&=&d_(k)g_^2(a ) , + p__g_g(k , a)&=&d_m(k)g_b^2(a ) , + p_(k , a)&=&d_m(k)g_^2(a ) , where the subscript @xmath24 denotes the curvature perturbation in the newtonian gauge , @xmath25 the growth function @xmath26 is defined as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the standard linear bias parameter between the density of galaxies and the underlying dark matter , @xmath29 . as we follow the positive sign conversion , @xmath30 is the growth function of @xmath31 .",
    "the shape factor of the perturbed metric power spectra @xmath32 is defined as d_(k)=^2__0(k)t^2_(k ) , which is a dimensionless metric power spectra at @xmath33 ( the matter  radiation equilibrium epoch ) , and @xmath34 is the initial fluctuations in the comoving gauge and @xmath35 is the transfer function normalised at @xmath36 . the primordial shape @xmath34 depends on @xmath37 ( the slope of the primordial power spectrum ) , as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the amplitude of the initial comoving fluctuations at the pivot scale , @xmath40 @xmath41 .",
    "the intermediate shape factor @xmath35 depends on @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the shape factor for the matter fluctuations , @xmath44 , which is important for both the galaxy  galaxy and velocity  velocity power spectra in eq .",
    "[ eq : pall ] above , is given by the conversion from @xmath32 of , d_m(k)d_(k ) , where , assuming @xmath45 , we can write @xmath46 .    in the kaiser limit",
    ", we would thus assume @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the linear power spectrum , and no smearing of the large scale power spectra due to the random motions of galaxies within individual dark matter halos , or the `` finger  of  god '' ( fog ) effect seen on small  scales in redshift surveys .",
    "therefore , the observed compression of @xmath11 along the line  of  sight due to coherent infall of galaxies around large ",
    "scale structures can be written in configuration space as , [ eq : xis ] _",
    "s(,)(a)&= & ( g_b^2+g_bg_+g_^2)_0(r ) p_0 ( ) + & -&(g_bg_+g_^2)_2(r ) p_2 ( ) + & + & g_^2_4(r)p_4 ( ) , where @xmath49 is the legendre polynomial and the spherical harmonic moment @xmath50 is given by , _",
    "l(r)=d_m(k)j_l(kr ) , where @xmath51 is a spherical bessel function .          the coherent evolution parts in eq .",
    "[ eq : pall ] are not generally parameterised by known standard cosmological parameters .",
    "we thus normalise these growth factors at @xmath33 such that , g_(a_eq)&=&1 , + g__m(a_eq)&=&a_eqg_(a_eq ) , + g_(a_eq)&=&. then , we treat @xmath26 and @xmath30 as free parameters to be measured by redshift  space distortions with cmb priors used to determine the shape factor @xmath44 at the last scattering surface .",
    "the shape factor @xmath44 depends mainly on the following set of cosmological parameters , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "while the first two parameters ( @xmath42 and @xmath37 ) are well constrained by the cmb at the last scattering surface ( regardless of theoretical model used to describe the late  time acceleration of the expansion of the universe ) , the last two parameters ( @xmath54 and @xmath53 ) can not be determined by the cmb alone .",
    "the primordial amplitude @xmath54 has been measured to an accuracy of less than @xmath55 from wmap7 alone , however this constraint becomes weaker due to the unknown reionization history of the universe ( tighter constraints are achieved by assuming a stepwise parameterisation of the reionization history ) . for the matter content of the universe , the cmb measures @xmath42 , not @xmath53 , which depends on the hubble constant .",
    "therefore , given our cmb priors , @xmath44 can be expressed as , d_m(k ) = ( ) ^2 d^*_m(k : a_s^*,_m^ * ) , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are specific reference values .",
    "we use the best fit cosmological parameters of the wmap7normalised @xmath4cdm model in this paper , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "then the power spectra can be re  written as , p__g_g(k , a)&=&(g_b)^2 d^*_m(k : a_s^*,_m^ * ) , + p_(k , a)&=&(g_)^2 d^*_m(k : a_s^*,_m^ * ) . here",
    ", we define new growth functions as , g_b^*(a)&&g_b(a ) + g_^*(a)&&g_(a ) .",
    "then the power spectra become p__g_g(k , a)&=&g_b^*2 d^*_m(k : a_s^*,_m^ * ) , + p_(k , a)&=&g_^*2 d^*_m(k : a_s^*,_m^ * ) , in which the power spectra are split into two parts , i.e. , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are determined through our redshift ",

    "we measure @xmath61 with a normalised @xmath64 , not @xmath30 paired with @xmath44 .",
    "however , as @xmath65 , @xmath66 does not depend on any normalisation , i.e. , @xmath66 is invariant under the transformation between the @xmath67 ( asterisk ) variables and those without above .",
    "thus , we present measured coherent motions not in terms of @xmath61 , but in terms of velocity dispersion derived from @xmath66 .",
    "hereafter , we drop _ @xmath68 _ symbol , i.e. _ ` unasteriked ' _ quantities imply _ ` asteriked ' _ quantities from now .      it has been pointed out in @xcite that the description of @xmath11 on large scales ( in linear theory ) will be modified due to dispersion effects in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "this effect was recently investigated using @xmath69-body simulations and was found to be important to include  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we have modified the kaiser limit using a gaussian velocity dispersion term for @xmath19 in eq .",
    "1 , which we will refer to as the  modified kaiser effect \" throughout .",
    "this modified model has been shown to work reasonable well on mock catalogues of a @xmath4cdm universe ( see  @xcite ) .    in detail , we can write @xmath19 as [ eq : vdispersion ] g(k,,_v)=e^-k^2 ^ 2_v^2 , where @xmath6 is the 1d velocity dispersion on large scales , and is the parameter of interest in this paper .",
    "we can write @xmath6 as , _",

    "this is somewhat confusing given @xmath6 is called a  velocity dispersion \" in previous literature , but we retain this terminology here to remain consistent with this literature .",

    "we therefore modify the kaiser effect using @xmath19 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : vdispersion ] , but keeping @xmath74 .",

    "if we assume @xmath143 is well  measured , then we can convert the units of @xmath6 using @xmath144 ( assuming @xmath4cdm ) to give @xmath7 km / s and @xmath8 km / s at the two redshifts listed in table  [ tab : vp ] . although we would not recommend using @xmath144 for cosmological constraints ( without a reliable @xmath145 measurement to an accuracy of a few percent ) , this conversion is more intuitive when discussing coherent motions and allows us to compare our values with other peculiar velocity measurements , e.g. , the  bulk flow \" measurements discussed in section i.    traditionally , coherent motions are estimated using the @xmath146 parameter  @xcite , _",
    "ob(k,)=(1+^2)p__g_g(k ) .",
    "this parameter is equivalent to @xmath147 in our notation , and measured to be @xmath148 and @xmath149 at @xmath2 and 0.38 respectively . as we have measured , @xmath26 is significantly sensitive to the different redshift  space distortion models , and @xmath146 is found to be @xmath150 and @xmath151 for the kaiser limit .",
    "thus , when measuring @xmath146 from the sdss dr7 lrg samples for use as cosmological constraints , it should be stated clearly which model for redshift - space distortions is assumed .",
    "if we assume a @xmath4cdm model , then the galaxy bias can be estimated from our measured @xmath26 values .",
    "we present values for @xmath28 in table  [ tab : vp ] , which are @xmath152 and @xmath153 at @xmath2 and 0.38 respectively .",
    "it is interesting to compare our measurements with @xmath154 as measured by  @xcite using the higher  order correlation function of lrgs from the sdss .",
    "this consistency supports our modified kaiser formulation , as the estimated @xmath155 using the original kaiser limit is different by more than one sigma .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : vphistory ] , we present our measurements of @xmath6 , the coherent motions of galaxies in redshift space , versus redshift and compared to theoretical predictions . as can be seen , our measurements are fully consistent with the wmap7normalised @xmath4cdm model .",
    "this represents a  clean \" test of these cosmological models free from contamination by non ",
    "linear physics on small  scales and uncertainties of the galaxy bias determination . these data probe the growth history of fluctuations in the universe and are thus complementary to the geometrical probes of the universe .    in fig  [ fig : vphistory ] , we also present predicted curves for the coherent motion of galaxies for a variety of dark energy models with varying constant equation of state from @xmath156 to @xmath157 ( dotted curves ) .",
    "all other cosmological parameters were fixed to be the same as the wmap7 best fit @xmath4cdm values , except @xmath158 . using these curves",
    ", we can approximately estimate that we have a constraint of @xmath159 , around a mean value of @xmath160 , from our @xmath6 measurements .",
    "this is consistent and complementary to similar constraints from geometrical observations of the universe  @xcite .",
    "finally , we also provide in fig  [ fig : vphistory ] a prediction for the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) self - accelerating braneworld scenario  @xcite .",
    "as can be seen , this cosmological model provides a poor description of our observations ( excluded at confidence of @xmath5 for both redshift bins ) , which support other observational constraints on this model from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , supernovae and hubble constant data  @xcite .",

    "we present in this paper new measurements of the coherent motions of galaxies on large - scales derived from a new methodology for analysing the redshift  space distortions seen in the observed two  dimensional two  point correlation function of luminous red galaxies from the sdss dr7 sample .",
    "our new methodology is based on measuring the scale  independent growth functions , @xmath26 ( galaxy density ) and @xmath30 ( velocity density ) , which do not depend upon the physics of the late universe ( e.g. dark energy ) .",
    "they do depend on our knowledge of the early universe , but this can be constrained using information from the cosmic microwave background .",
    "we have determined values of @xmath30 from the redshift ",
    "space distortions seen in the sdss dr7 lrg data and , converting these values into the 1d velocity dispersion @xmath6 , we find @xmath161 at a mean redshift of @xmath2 and @xmath141 at @xmath140",
    ". these values for @xmath6 are fully consistent with a wmap7normalized @xmath4cdm model with @xmath162 as illustrated in fig  [ fig : vphistory ] .",
    "our observations are however , inconsistent with a dgp model for the universe to high statistical significance ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "our results provide a competitive , and complementary , constraint on these cosmological models compared to the usual geometric probes of the universe .    we have converted our measured values of @xmath6 into velocity units ( as opposed to lengths presented above ) and find @xmath7 km / s and @xmath8 km / s at a mean redshift of @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , assuming a @xmath4cdm universe . as expected , these coherent motions ( or velocity dispersions ) are fully consistent with expectations from a @xmath4cdm universe .",
    "these estimates are however , inconsistent with local measurements of the peculiar velocity field ( or  bulk flows \" ) which have recently been measured to be greater than these velocities and expectations from @xmath4cdm  @xcite .",
    "if the amplitude of these local , observed bulk flows were converted ( using @xmath144 and assuming a flat @xmath4cdm model ) to the redshift range studied here ( @xmath164 ) , then we might expect to see larger coherent motions .",
    "it is difficult to perform a direct comparison of these different velocity measurements because of the different methods and redshift intervals used .",
    "for example , the lower redshift measurements of @xcite or @xcite only probe the velocity field out to 150@xmath165mpc using their composite sample , while most of the data is within a sphere of radius of @xmath166mpc depending on the weighting scheme used ( see fig 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , our statistical estimate of coherent motions on the scales up to 60@xmath165mpc are derived from within a large volume of the universe at higher redshift , e.g. , 0.5@xmath167gpc@xmath168 ( @xmath83 ) and 1.1@xmath167gpc@xmath168 ( @xmath84 ) respectively , assuming a flat wmap7 cosmology .",
    "therefore , our measurements have averaged over many hundreds of subregions of approximately the same size as the volume used by  @xcite ( assuming a subregion of radius of 60@xmath165mpc ) .",
    "furthermore , there are potential differences in the possible directions of the velocity measurements being compared .",
    "the direction of the local velocity measurements of  @xcite point towards @xmath169 degrees of right ascension ( ra ) and declination respectively on the sky , while our sdss dr7 data is centred at @xmath170 ( equatorial coordinates ) and concentrated in the northern hemisphere , i.e. our patch is not along the direction relevant to the patches used in  @xcite or  @xcite .",
    "a direct comparison of the directions of the various velocity measurements is hard as again our sdss measurement is a statistical average over many subregions of space and thus has no directional information . that said , our statistical measurement of coherent velocities within such sized volumes of the universe is smaller , to high statistical significance , than that measured locally around our galaxy .",
    "a more interesting comparison would be with the measurements of @xcite who find a  bulk flow \" of x  ray clusters , with respect to the cmb , of @xmath171 km / s out to @xmath172mpc ( or 560@xmath173mpc for comparison herein ) in approximately the same direction as discussed above for the local measurements  @xcite .",
    "again , it is hard to make a direction comparison in terms of the bulk velocity amplitude and direction as our statistical measurements are derived from higher redshift  @xcite , they note that their bulk flow velocities peak at @xmath174 with the possibility of higher redshift clusters providing little to their dipole measurements .",
    "this is therefore , below our low redshift lrg sample data , and averaged over a larger volume , than used by @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for the differences we are seeing is that our galaxy is located in an unusual part of the universe , e.g. , in a highly over , or underdense region of the universe .",
    "again , our measurements are obtained at @xmath175 , beyond the redshift limits of all these local measurements  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we can not exclude the presence of a large constant large - scale  dark flow \" across the volume surveyed by our dr7 data i.e. , a velocity dipole with no variation across @xmath176gpc@xmath168 of the universe .",
    "such a constant flow would be undetectable by our method as the correlation function in redshift space is distorted by the divergence of the peculiar velocity field , while measuring the bulk flows via the sz effect can include a possible global flow .",
    "however , this explanation would require the  dark flow \" of @xcite to extend out beyond the sdss lrg sample ( @xmath177 ) to leave it undetectable , i.e. , over a 1000@xmath165 mpcs in scale .",
    "this can be tested using the sdss - iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) , which will provide redshift - space distortion measurements both at higher redshift and over larger volumes of the universe  @xcite .    in the future",
    "we plan to extend our measurements to higher redshifts , in order to extend the history of coherent motions ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : vphistory ] ) .",
    "as shown in our paper , these motions can be measured in an independent way , free of some of the problems associated with other measures of the growth history of the universe , and the assumed cosmological model for the late ",
    "time universe , e.g. , we are able to test not only the conventional dark energy model , but also  interacting \" and  clustered \" dark energy models , not to mention the general class of modified gravity theories . unlike other approaches , our measurements are free from any possible violation of the consistent equations .",
