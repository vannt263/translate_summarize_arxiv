    "the starting point is a conservative high - resolution finite volume discretization on a uniform mesh of or . a multiresolution analysis of the solution with subsequent thresholding of the coefficients allows an approximation with less coefficients within a given tolerance .",

    "the multiresolution strategy proposed herein for strongly degenerate parabolic equations with a discontinuous flux produces a gain in computational time and in memory .",
    "the solution is efficiently represented using a graded tree data structure and the costly fluxes are computed on the locally refined grid only . the computational efficiency of the multiresolution method is related to the data compression rate , that is , to the amount of significant information preserved after thresholding in comparison with the number of grid points of the finest mesh .",

    "note that for with @xmath194 , the function @xmath15 has an explicit closed - form representation , see @xcite .",
    "the reference numerical scheme is with @xmath195 .",

    "the feed concentration corresponds to @xmath198 .",
    "figure  [ fig:3d_compress2a ] shows the numerical solution until @xmath199 . in this case",
    "we consider the device with an initial concentration distribution of @xmath200 , @xmath201 $ ] and we can observe the initial stage of the fill - up process .",
    "for this example , we take an initial dynamic graded tree , allowing @xmath202 multiresolution levels , and for the reference tolerance we use @xmath203 , so @xmath204 .",
    "for example  3 we use as a reference solution a fine grid computation with @xmath205 control volumes . table  [ table : traf_3 ] again displays the behaviour of the error and the gain in computational effort and data storage for different times .",
    "also , analogously to the previous examples , we observe in figure  [ fig : traf_3_errors ] the same slope between the @xmath166 errors for the finite volume and multiresolution methods .",
    "this error is masured here at @xmath206 .",
    "note that in all numerical examples , the speed - up factor  @xmath161 increases as @xmath207 is increased , even if the data compression rate  @xmath160 remains constant , which approximately is the case in table  [ table : traf_3 ] , or even decreases , as we see , for example , by comparing the values of @xmath160 for @xmath208 and @xmath209 in table  [ table : traf_1 ] .",
    "the explanation of this discrepancy is that while @xmath160 measures the quality of performance of the multiresolution seen at the instant @xmath210 , the speed - up factor  @xmath161 is referred to the total time of simulation and also includes the `` overhead '' required by initializing the graded tree in step  ( 2 ) of the multiresolution algorithm .",
    "the initialization requires a fixed amount of cpu time , which is independent of the number of total time steps ( which is porportional to @xmath207 , since we consider @xmath135 to be fixed ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a standard fv method on a fixed grid will always require cpu time proportional to the number of time steps .",
    "this explains why even if  @xmath160 does not change significantly , we observe an inprovement of the speed - up factor  @xmath161 as @xmath207 is increased .",
    "before discussing our results , we comment that the standings of both applicative models are slightly different .",
    "numerous mathematical models have been proposed for one - directional flows of vehicular traffic ; reviews of this topic are given in the monographs by helbing @xcite , kerner @xcite and garavello and piccoli @xcite , as well as in the articles by bellomo et al .",
    "@xcite . these and other works vividly illustrate that the number of balance equations ( for the car density , velocity , and possibly other flow variables ) that form a time - dependent model based on partial differential equations , as well as the algebraic structure of these equations , is a topic of current research . fortunately , all these models are spatially one - dimensional , and a circular road with periodic boundary conditions provides a setup that is both physically meaningful ( since the flow is horizontal ) and easy to implement for numerical simulation .",
    "this setup , on one hand , is widely used to compare different traffic models , and on the other hand allows to assess the local influence and long - term behaviour of nonlinearities and inhomogeneities such as the ones introduced in section  [ sec6.1 ] .",
    "while the traffic problem highlights the use of the scheme used herein to explore different models , the clarifier - thickener model calls for an efficient tool to perform simulations , on one hand , related to clarifier - thickener design and control @xcite , and on the other hand , to parameter identification calculations @xcite .",
    "in fact , depending on the parameters , clarifier - thickener operations such as fill - up may extend over weeks and months @xcite , and require large simulation times , while the parameter identification procedures in @xcite proceed by solution of an adjoint problem , which needs storage of the complete solution of the previously solved direct problem .",
    "clearly , methods that imply savings in both computational time and memory storage , such as the multiresolution scheme presented herein , are of significant practical interest for the clarifier - thickener model .",
    "both mathematical models considered herein exhibit three types of fronts that typically occur in solutions of , namely standard shocks ( i.e. , discontinuities between solution values for both of which is hyperbolic ) , hyperbolic - parabolic type - change interfaces ( such as the sediment level in example  3 ) , and stationary discontinuities located at the discontinuities of @xmath5 .",
    "the basic motivation for applying a finite volume multiresolution scheme is that this device is is sufficiently flexible to produce the refinement necessary to properly capture all these discontinuities , and leads to considerable gains in storage as can be seen from the sparsity of the graded trees in our numerical examples .",
    "moreover , figure  [ fig : errores_fv_mr_sedim ] confirms that we may effectively control the perturbation error , in the sense that the error of the resulting finite volume multiresolution scheme remains of the same order as that of the finite volume scheme on a uniform grid .",
    "we recall from section  [ sec : error ] that the feasibility of this control depends on an estimate of the convergence rate of the basic discretization on a uniform grid , which is an open problem for strongly degenerate parabolic equations .",
    "although our numerical results look promising , they still alert to some shortcomings that call for improvement .",
    "the most obvious one is the limitation of the time step according to the spatial step size of the finest grid , which can possibly be removed by using a space - time adaptive scheme such as the recent finite volume multiresolution schemes by stiriba and mller  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the basic finite volume scheme accurately resolves the discontinuities of the solution sitting at the jumps of @xmath5 at any level of discretization ; these discontinuities are not approximated by smeared transitions ( as are discontinuities at positions where @xmath5 is smooth ) , see @xcite .",
    "this means that the refinement the multiresolution produces near these discontinuities , which is visible in figures  [ fig : clar_1ad ] and  [ fig : clar_1eh ] , and which is based on the adaptation of the refinement according to features of the solution ( but not of  @xmath5 ) , is possibly unnecessary , and that a more efficient version of the present method may be feasible .",
