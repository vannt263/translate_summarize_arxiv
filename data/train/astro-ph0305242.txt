    "milagrito detected tev emission from grb 970417a ( atkins et al .",
    "this luminosity is almost same with that of low energy range .",
    "there are models of tev emission through proton synchrotron emission ( totani 1999 ) or synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) of electron ( eg .",
    "dermer , chiang & mitman 2000 ; pilla & loeb 1998 ) , from grb .",
    "totani ( 1999 ) discuss small number of detection of grb is attributed to a number of low redshift grb because gamma ray emission from high redshift grbs attenuate by making an interaction with infrared background .",
    "therefore , tibet iii and milagro(atkins et al . , 2001 ) aim to observe grb with low tev gamma ray energy where the interaction is less .",
    "results of tibet iii and milagro have not been presented yet . here ,",
    "we propose more sensitive detector , tev cherenkov all sky monitor ( iact asm ) .",
    "we discuss feasibility of grb with tibet iii , milagro and iact asm and discuss necessity of iact asm .",
    "there are two cosmic ray detectors , milagro and tibetiii at low tev energy .",
    "we propose iact asm which is more sensitive detector .",
    "we use frenel lens instead of reflecting mirrors , which cover field of view ( f.o.v . ) of 60@xmath060 degrees with an accuracy 0.1 degree .",
    "we consider two cases , iact asm of diameter 4 m , 10 m . as for sensitivity of iact asm ( 4 m )",
    ", we refer to observation result of cangaroo i which diameter is 3.8 m and angular resolution 0.1 degree .",
    "yoshikoshi ( 1996 ) observed vela pulsar with cangaroo i. flux is obtained 2.5@xmath1 s@xmath2 @xmath3 at 2.5 tev with 174h .",
    "on observation(4.4@xmath4 ) . with 1 sec observation , we obtain sensitivity of 2.0@xmath5 s@xmath2@xmath3(4.4@xmath4 ) .",
    "we use a formula s / n@xmath6 ( @xmath7 : sensitivity(ph s@xmath2 @xmath3 ) , @xmath8 : background(ph s@xmath2 @xmath3 str@xmath2 ) , @xmath9 : effective area(@xmath10 ) , @xmath11:integrated time(sec ) , @xmath12:angular resolution(str ) ) .",
    "this value is not correct because of image parameter cut , but good indicator .",
    "next , we derive a sensitivity of tibet iii which is sensitive to gamma ray above 3 tev . with flux of cosmic ray @xmath13s@xmath2 @xmath3 and an angular resolution 1 degree , we obtain a sensitivity of 10@xmath14s@xmath2@xmath3 ( 4@xmath4 ) with 1 sec observation .",
    ".the comparison of tibet iii and iact asm 4 m which are sensitive to gamma ray above 3 tev .",
    "time duration of grb 1 sec is considered . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we found an important parameter is not sensitivity , but effective area for detection of grb .",
    "we found a feasibility of grb is high with iact asm 10 m .",
