    "quantum computing is the art of controlling quantum coherence at will .",
    "it is no surprise then that the main obstacle towards this enormous achievement is the decoherence that any real - life quantum system will suffer unavoidably .",
    "the quest to overcome this difficulty , first believed to be insurmountable , led to the creation of quantum error correcting codes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these codes revolve around the idea of storing a small amount of quantum information in a large number of quantum degrees of freedom , so that the redundancy makes the information more resilient to errors . among the most fruitful ones are stabilizer quantum error correcting codes @xcite , @xcite , which are particularly easy to analyze .",
    "some of them even allow to implement interesting sets of gates transversally , that is , in such a way that localized errors do not spread uncontrolledly over the code block .",
    "transversal gates have proved themselves very useful , but sometimes they are not enough . in this paper",
    "we consider the concept of code deformation , which enlarges the amount of fault tolerant gates naturally implementable in a given code .",
    "the idea is that a quantum error correcting code can be slightly changed to give a new one , and that such changes can be applied one after the other to produce quantum gates on encoded qubits .",
    "the amount of encoded qubits can change due to deformations , giving rise to initialization and measurement operations . as we will see such ideas are natural in the context of topological codes , but they could be applied in other kinds of quantum error correcting codes .",
    "an important practical problem regarding many theoretical proposals involving quantum error correction and fault tolerant computation is the non - locality of the elementary gates between the physical qubits that make up the codes . in some practical devices ,",
    "elementary gates have a local nature , a severe restriction when errors are to be taken into account . here",
    "dimensionality is another important issue , since it is not the same thing to have local gates in a 1d , 2d or 3d system",
    ".    surface codes , introduced by kitaev @xcite , are stabilizer codes with the interesting feature of being local in a 2d setup .",
    "in particular , the qubits can be arranged in a 2d lattice in such a way that the necessary measurements to control the errors only involve as few as four neighboring qubits .",
    "then one can envision a quantum computer as a stack of layers .",
    "each layer is a surface code encoding a single qubit , and cnot gates are performed transversally in pairs of layers .",
    "the problem with surface codes is that no other gate can be transversally implemented . to overcome this difficulty color codes",
    "were developed @xcite , which are also local in 2d , but allow the transversal implementation of the whole clifford group , which is enough for quantum distillation and many other quantum information tasks , such as quantum teleportation .",
    "extensions of color codes to 3d with nice transversal properties for universal quantum computation are also possible @xcite .",
    "however , working with a 2d setup is a rather typical scenario in technological applications such as lithographic techniques and the like . in that case",
    ", the above setting with several stacks of planar codes becomes useless .",
    "then one can wonder wether it is possible to implement non - trivial gates by means of some different scheme .",
    "in this paper we answer this question in the positive . in particular ,",
    "we show how non - destructive measurements and cnot gates can be obtained by deforming a single - layered surface code .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the standard approach to surface codes .",
    "the idea of inserting and removing physical qubits from a surface code was introduced in @xcite as a way to correct transversal hadamard gates .",
    "this insertion an removal gives rise to a progressive reshaping of the lattice or , what is the same , a deformation of the code .",
    "we want to stress that indeed there is a fixed underlying lattice of qubits .",
    "when we say that a site is added to or removed from the surface code , we do not mean a change in the underlying physical system but just on the stabilizers that define our code . in a sense , what we are reshaping is a ` software ' lattice , whereas the underlying ` hardware ' lattice remains intact .",
    "similar ideas have already been discussed in the context of cluster states @xcite .",
    "our approach differs in several aspects .",
    "first , our discussion is based solely on the properties of 2d topological codes with no additional structure , which makes it clearer .",
    "it is natural for us to consider not only surfaces with holes , but really any kind of topologies , including those in which two types of boundaries appear next to each other .",
    "the way in which we propose to perform deformations fits naturally in the error correction scheme discussed in @xcite , and we show how the gates discussed in that work can be applied in our context . moreover , we discuss code deformation in such a way that it can be inmediately applied to other codes , for example those in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "regarding approaches to surface codes for topological quantum computation processing , we want to stress that throughout this paper we are considering the scenario of active quantum error correction introduced in @xcite but applied to codes based on topological properties of a quantum system .",
    "the benefits that we want to explore in this approach come from the nice locality properties of surface codes and the metods for code deformation that we introduce .",
    "this is sometimes referred as quantum protection at the software level .",
    "yet , there is another approach to topological quantum computation also envisioned by kitaev @xcite that considers the possibility of achieving the protection of quantum states at the hardware level .",
    "the underlying idea in this alternative proposal is that the quantum topological properties of the system may yield a self - protecting scenario in which , when an error pops up in the code , then the system is so well - protected topologically that it can correct those errors internally by itself , without resorting to external means as in the active error correction scenario .",
    "the initial reasons to believe that surface codes could lead to this type of self - protecting robustness were based on both the resistance to local errors versus global encoding along with the existence of a protecting energy gap .",
    "this gap is allegedly the physical mechanism for the topological protection since the quantum code is represented by the degenerate ground state of a quantum lattice hamiltonian and the excited states amount to errors in the quantum topological code .",
    "however , kitaev hamiltonians are not stable with respect to thermal noise .",
    "this fact was already noticed in @xcite , and more recently , a final rigorous proof has been given in @xcite .",
    "the only known model which shows thermal stability is the 4d kitaev model @xcite .    in summary , we want to stress that in this paper our approach is that of active quantum error correction .",
    "in particular , this means that we are not considering any kitaev hamiltonian associated to our quantum codes .",
    "instead , we perform external operations to achieve quantum error corrections on systems where the encoding of information is done at the topological level .",
    "an error correcting code is a subspace of the space of states of a given quantum system .",
    "the error correcting capabilities are related to the fact that certain operators or errors , those that the code can detect , do not connect orthogonal encoded states .",
    "we want to consider small changes that progressively deform one stabilizer code into another .",
    "the motivation is that such deformations can be used to initialize , transform and measure encoded qubits .      given a certain number of qubits , its group of pauli operators @xmath0 is defined as that generated by tensor products of the usual @xmath1 and @xmath2 single - qubit pauli operators . for example , if we have five qubits , a generator would be @xmath3 .",
    "a stabilizer code @xcite , @xcite of length @xmath4 is a subspace of the quantum system of @xmath4 qubits .",
    "it is described as the subspace @xmath5 stabilized by an abelian subgroup @xmath6 .",
    "the stabilizer group @xmath7 must not contain @xmath8 as an element , and if it has @xmath9 independent generators @xmath10 , the encoded subspace @xmath5 has dimension @xmath11 and thus we say that it encodes @xmath12 qubits .",
    "the encoded states @xmath13 are characterized by the conditions @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "an important tool in the understanding of stabilizer codes is the normalizer @xmath16 of @xmath7 .",
    "this is the subgroup of pauli operators that commute with all the elements of @xmath7 .",
    "define the weight of a pauli operator as the number of non - trivial terms in its tensor product expression .",
    "then , the minimum of the weights of the elements of @xmath17 gives the so called distance of the code .",
    "this is the minimun number of qubits that we have to manipulate in order to change one encoded state into another .",
    "thus , the bigger this distance , the bigger the noise resilience of the code . from the normalizer",
    "one can always choose elements @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 such that @xmath21=0 , \\qquad [ z_i , z_j]=0,\\qquad x_i z_j=(-1)^{\\delta_{i , j } } x_j z_i.\\ ] ] these generate the group of encoded pauli operators , that is , the pauli operators of the encoded qubits .",
    "consider two codes @xmath5 , @xmath22 with stabilizers @xmath7 , @xmath23 , both with the same number of physical qubits @xmath4 and encoded qubits @xmath12 .",
    "let us denote the generators of the stabilizers as @xmath10 , @xmath24 , and the elements of the basis of encoded pauli operators as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the clifford group @xcite consists of those unitary operators @xmath27 in our system of @xmath4 qubits such that for any element @xmath28 we have @xmath29 .",
    "consider the subset of clifford operators @xmath27 with @xmath30 , that is , those that transform @xmath5 into @xmath22 .",
    "such operators are very general .",
    "for example , they include transversal operations @xcite , @xcite , in which @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 some unitary single - qubit operator .",
    "transversal operations have a great importance in fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite , @xcite , but it is interesting to look for alternatives that can widen the applicability of fault - tolerant codes . here",
    "we explore the idea of code deformations , in which only some of the generators of the stabilizer change . then ,",
    "if @xmath34 of them change we can write @xmath35 for @xmath36 . if this @xmath34 is somehow small , it makes sense to talk about code deformations .",
    "we will see how in surface codes deformations have indeed a geometrical meaning , because they take the form of localized changes in the shape of a given surface . because these changes do not alter the topology of the surfaces , we call them smooth deformations .    when @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 if @xmath41 for some @xmath42",
    ". the evolution of the encoded pauli operators determines , up to a phase , the unitary evolution of the encoded qubits under @xmath27 . in the case of code deformations , which change the code only partially",
    ", we can successively apply several operators @xmath43 so that @xmath44 takes the code into itself .",
    "thus , we can use deformations to perform clifford gates , as we will see in particular in surface codes .",
    "we have said that both codes , the initial and the final , have the same number of physical qubits .",
    "however , it should be noted that we can use the previous description also in a case in which the numbers differ .",
    "this is so because we can always enlarge any code with additional qubits .",
    "we simply add one stabilizer generator per new qubit , each one , for example , a @xmath2 on the corresponding qubit .",
    "this way , extra qubits are in a fixed state for encoded states and thus do not affect the code .    indeed , it was the need to enlarge an existing code qubit by qubit which motivated the introduction of code deformations in @xcite for surface codes . in the mentioned work the operator @xmath27 , which amounts to several local cnot gates ,",
    "is applied explicitly to the code in order to deform it .",
    "alternatively , one can perform the deformation by measuring the new stabilizers @xmath24 , @xmath45 .",
    "some of the measurements can give an undesired value , so that the obtained code has stabilizers @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "this could then be corrected applying a suitable pauli operator , as we will see in specific examples .",
    "in practice , however , this correction is unnecessary , at least when error correction reduces to monitor errors in the system , as in @xcite . in that case",
    ", one performs round after round of measurements . in each round , all the generators @xmath10 are measured .",
    "these measurements are used to calculate with high confidence which errors occurred .",
    "when some measurement is done on encoded qubits , it must be interpreted taking these errors into account , which are never really corrected in any other way . performing deformations by measuring the stabilizers",
    "fits nicely in this error correction scheme , because we can change the stabilizers to be measured from one round to another in order to get the desired deformations .",
    "however , for this deformation procedure to work it must be possible to correct errors successfully with high probability . in other case",
    ", one has to apply directly a suitable unitary operator . in the case of surface codes",
    ", deformations can be done through measurements as long as we keep them local when compared to the support of encoded pauli operators , except for encoded operators which are being initialized or measured , as we discuss in the next section .",
    "the code transformations discussed in the previous section can not change the number of encoded qubits .",
    "they can be done without introducing stabilizer violations , simply by implementing @xmath27 suitably .",
    "but we can consider more general clifford operators @xmath27 , in particular such that the initial code @xmath5 and the final code @xmath22 have a different number of encoded qubits .",
    "the condition @xmath48 can no longer be imposed . in the case of deformations in surface codes , as will see , these correspond to changes in the topology of the surface , and thus we call them non - smooth deformations .",
    "suppose first that @xmath5 encodes @xmath12 qubits and @xmath49 encodes @xmath50 qubits .",
    "then @xmath22 has one stabilizer generator less .",
    "we consider those clifford operators @xmath27 with @xmath51 , that is , those which transform encoded states into encoded states .",
    "then @xmath52 is a subset of @xmath53 generated by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a nontrivial encoded pauli operator , @xmath56 .",
    "this @xmath55 has eigenvalue one after @xmath27 has been applied .",
    "thus , @xmath27 not only adds one qubit but also initializes it in a definite way .",
    "we can consider in a similar way the introduction of several new qubits and their initialization .",
    "in the particular case of surface code deformations , such operators @xmath27 will introduce changes in the topology which increase the number of nontrivial cycles .    now consider the reverse case , so that @xmath5 encodes @xmath12 qubits and @xmath22 encodes @xmath57 qubits .",
    "then @xmath49 has one stabilizer generator more .",
    "we consider those clifford operators @xmath27 with @xmath58 , that is , those which are inverses of the transformations just considered .",
    "then , @xmath59 is a subset of @xmath16 generated by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a nontrivial encoded pauli operator , @xmath60 .",
    "this @xmath55 is mapped onto an element of @xmath61 through @xmath27 , and in this sense gets measured .",
    "thus , @xmath27 removes one qubit and the corresponding degrees of freedom map onto possible violations of the stabilizer in the new code .",
    "again , we can consider the removal and measurement of several qubits at the same time . for surface codes , such operators @xmath27 will introduce changes in the topology which decrease the number of nontrivial cycles .",
    "it should be noted that after initializing @xmath55 or before measuring it we do not care if the code suffers a @xmath55 error . in the first case because the encoded state satisfies @xmath62 , so that the action of @xmath55 is trivial . in the second case , because the error will create decoherence between states with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which is irrelevant since we intend to measure @xmath55 .",
    "this discussion is pertinent for surface codes , since changes in the topology will expose the code to errors , but these errors will always correspond to the operators being measured or initialized . in a surface code ,",
    "the protection of quantum information is obtained by storing it in non - local degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , it is unavoidable that when we perform an abrupt change in the topology of the surface some degrees of freedom become local .",
    "fortunately , this causes no harm , because to initialize or measure an encoded operator @xmath55 we only make @xmath55 local .",

    "[ figura_surface_codes ] .",
    "this lattice will have borders , which can be best understood as big missing faces .",
    "since there are two kinds of plaquettes , dark and light , borders have also this labeling . in the interface between a dark and a light border",
    "there are missing edges that would separate the missing plaquettes .    to construct the quantum error correcting code from the lattice",
    ", a physical qubit must be placed at each site .",
    "the stabilizer @xmath7 is generated by plaquette operators . given a plaquette @xmath64",
    "we define the plaquette operator @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) as the tensor product of @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) pauli operators acting on those qubits lying on the plaquette",
    ". then we attach @xmath65 operators to dark plaquettes and @xmath66 operators to light plaquettes .",
    "all these operators commute due to the properties of the lattice , and thus the stabilizer is well defined .",
    "any operator which is just a tensor product of @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) operators acting on certain qubits can be visualized as a string that goes through the corresponding sites and lives on dark ( light ) plaquettes , see fig .",
    "[ figura_surface_codes ] .",
    "so given a dark ( light ) strings @xmath67 , i.e. a geometric object , we attach to it the operator @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",

    "( d ) a dark border was reduced to expose the encoded @xmath1 . ,",

    "we are now in position to discuss deformations in surface codes .",
    "as we have already mentioned , these take the form of geometrical changes in the shape of the surface . as qubits enter and exit the code , the dark and light borders of the surface change .",
    "we can move the borders , glue them together or create new ones cutting the surface .",
    "although we talk about introducing and removing qubits from the surface , there is a fixed underlying square lattice of physical qubits .",
    "we change the stabilizers that define the code , not the physical system .",
    "the basic mechanism is exemplified in fig .",

    "first we want to consider smooth deformations , in which the topology of the surface is not altered .",
    "such transformations can not change the number of encoded qubits , but can perform unitary gates on them .",
    "so suppose that we deform a surface in an arbitrary way , taking it finally back to its original form .",

    "moreover , we can find light strings @xmath86 and dark strings @xmath87 so that @xmath88 and @xmath89 satisfy .",
    "then , if @xmath27 is the clifford operator that performs the desired deformation on the surface code , we have @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 , @xmath93.the equations give the evolution of encoded pauli operators under @xmath27 in terms of the continuous map @xmath84 produced by the deformation related to @xmath27 .",
    "it should be noted that is very restrictive when compared to the general , so that many clifford operations can not be implemented using deformations . in particular , hadamard gates @xmath94 are out of reach because @xmath95 and deformations do not mix @xmath1 and @xmath2 operators .",
    "an example is displayed in fig .",
    "[ figura_cnot_basica ] , where the effect of moving a light hole around a dark one is analized .",

    "taking @xmath102 and @xmath103 , @xmath104 , as the relevant encoded operators , the result of the deformation is @xmath105 which corresponds to a cnot gate with the first qubit as source .",
    "what happens when a surface code is drastically deformed ?",
    "let us return to the example code of fig .",
    "[ figura_codigo_simple](a ) and deform it till there exists a nontrivial string of length one , see fig .",
    "[ figura_codigo_simple](c ) . observe that at this point our code is absolutely exposed to @xmath1 errors , but not to @xmath2 errors .",
    "the point then is that not only the environment can measure the encoded @xmath106 , but _ we also can_. since @xmath2 errors are still unlikely , the measurement is protected by the code .",
    "although the measurement seems local , in practice we have to take error correction into account . for now , we will just concentrate on the effects of deformations in the absence of errors , and leave the discussion of their correction for later .",
    "the deformation can be undone , with the net result that the encoded state has been projected .",
    "thus , we have succeeded in performing a non - destructive quantum measurement by code deformation .",
    "visually , the measurement amounts to temporarily shrink one of the dimensions of the surface . we could have also employed a similar procedure to measure in the border , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figura_codigo_simple](d ) . in this case",
    "one of the dark borders is contracted .",
    "the procedures that we have just described involve only smooth deformations , because we did not change the topology of the surface .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ figura_codigo_simple](c , d ) the removal of a single qubit would have changed the topology . because of the topological nature of the codes and their error correction procedures , it is more natural to consider non - smooth deformations .",
    "for example , let @xmath5 be the surface code of fig .",
    "[ figura_codigo_simple](c ) and let @xmath107 be the qubit that maintains both pieces of the surface connected .",
    "suppose that we remove @xmath107 to obtain a new surface code @xmath22 .",
    "the dark square plaquettes that contained @xmath107 in @xmath5 are triangular after its removal .",
    "we call these new plaquettes @xmath108 . because we want @xmath109 to include @xmath107 , we need also an extra stabilizer to fix it .",
    "we choose @xmath110 , the @xmath1 pauli operator on @xmath107 . removing @xmath107 amounts to cut the surface , and @xmath22 encodes no qubits , so that we know that the deformation maps some encoded pauli operator of the original code to a stabilizer of the new one .",
    "in fact , we can take @xmath111 as the deformation operator .",
    "let @xmath112 .",
    "then , if @xmath113 , we have @xmath114 . on the contrary , if @xmath115 then @xmath116 . in particular , @xmath117 violates the stabilizer conditions for the generators @xmath110 , @xmath65 and @xmath118 . in this sense , in going from @xmath5 to @xmath22 we are measuring @xmath106 .",
    "more generally , cutting a surface along a light string @xmath67 that connects two different light borders amounts to measuring @xmath69 .",
    "for cutting the surface along @xmath67 we mean removing all the qubits along it , and we suppose that the operator @xmath27 that performs the cut acts locally , in a neighborhood of the string . to check the previous statement ,",
    "consider a light string @xmath119 which is a slight deformation of @xmath67 lying out of the support of @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "in addition , @xmath122 because @xmath119 is a boundary in the new surface . moreover , if @xmath117 is an eigenstate of the stabilizers of @xmath61 , then @xmath123 iff the number of violations in dark plaquettes in an area with boundary @xmath119 is odd .",
    "thus , the cut maps the eigenvalue of @xmath124 to the parity of the number of violations that appear at each side of the cut . in the case of cuts along",
    "dark strings @xmath67 , the measured operator is of course @xmath68 .",

    "thus , here we only intend to show how code deformation can be integrated into the picture given there , which we summarize now .",
    "first , error correction amounts really to keep track of errors as they show up . to this end , the local generators of the stabilizer are measured time after time .",
    "the results of each round of measurements gives a time slice , or indeed two , one for violations of @xmath1-type generators and one for violations of @xmath2-type generators .",
    "for each type , the slices are arranged in a ( 2 + 1)-@xmath128 fashion , where the extra dimension is time .",
    "then , if violations at a given time are considered as particles , in the ( 2 + 1)-@xmath128 picture we have their wordlines .",
    "in fact , from the measurements we do not get the actual wordlines . rather , they have to be inferred , which can be done correctly with high probability using certain algorithm@xcite as long as errors are below a threshold . for the procedure to succeed",
    ", the actual wordlines and the inferred ones must be homologically equivalent .    when deformations enter the picture , the error correction procedure that we have just described is left basically unchanged .",
    "when deformations involve a measurement , that is , the lost of an encoded qubit , the value of the measurement must be recovered taking into account the corrections .",
    "that is , the relevant stabilizer violations must be checked after errors have been canceled out .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that only the homology of the wordlines is relevant .",
    "there are many ways to encode qubits and to manipulate them through deformations in a surface code . here",
    "we have chosen an implementation that is closely connected to the one in @xcite . however , many other implementations could be given .",
    "for example , a disk with a dark external border and @xmath4 dark holes encodes @xmath4 qubits : @xmath18 operators correspond to strings that enclose the holes and @xmath19 operators correspond to strings that connect holes to the external border .",
    "our starting point is a surface code with an arbitrary shape . as long as cut and paste operations are performed far enough from the borders , they are unimportant .",
    "the encoded qubits are holes in this surface , with the particular dark - light - dark - light border structure depicted in fig .",
    "[ figura_qubits](a ) .",
    "we impose the condition that any string operator that surrounds such a hole must have eigenvalue @xmath125 , something that will be preserved by the gates proposed below .",
    "the encoded @xmath2 and @xmath1 operators can be measured by shortening a suitable border . as for the initialization procedure for these encoded qubits in @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) states ,",
    "it comprises two steps .",
    "first a dark ( light ) hole is created by puncturing the code .",
    "then a pair of light ( dark ) borders are grown along the border of the hole .",

    "[ figura_cnot](b ) .",
    "this operation introduces two new encoded qubits because now new nontrivial strings exist .",
    "next , one of the holes on the source qubit winds around one of the holes of the target qubit , as shown in figs .",
    "[ figura_cnot](b , c ) .",
    "this step is where the cnot gate really takes place .",
    "finally , both qubits must recover their original shape .",
    "this step involves cutting along strings , so that the two qubits that where created in the first step are measured . comparing fig .",
    "[ figura_cnot](a ) and fig .",
    "[ figura_cnot](d ) we see that encoded operators evolve as in , so that a cnot is obtained .",
