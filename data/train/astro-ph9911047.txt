    "although the warm ionized medium ( wim ) , also called the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) , is a principal component of the interstellar medium in our galaxy and others , the source of its ionization and heating is not understood ( e.g. , reynolds 1995 ; rand 1998 ) . observed line intensities , particularly the high values of [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 and [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 compared to those in traditional , discrete h ii regions surrounding o and early b stars suggest that photoionization by a dilute radiation field plays an important role ( e.g. , domgrgen & mathis 1994 ) ; both models and observations indicate that these emission lines originate primarily from warm ( @xmath10 k ) regions in which the hydrogen is nearly fully ionized ( e.g. , sembach et al 1999 ; reynolds et al 1998 ) .",
    "it has been suggested by miller & cox ( 1993 ) and dove & shull ( 1994 ) , for example , that lyman continuum radiation originating from o stars penetrates the h i cloud layer and ionizes diffuse interstellar gas within the disk and lower halo . while o stars are the only known source with sufficient power to maintain the wim , the high opacity of the interstellar h i has led others to propose the existence of more widely distributed sources of ionization ( e.g. , slavin et al 1993 ; mellott et al 1988 and sciama 1990 ; raymond 1992 ; skibo & ramaty 1993 ) .",
    "photoionization models incorporating a low ionization parameter u ( the ratio of photon density to gas density ) have been generally successful in accounting for the elevated [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 and [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 and low [ o  iii ] @xmath115007/h@xmath0 ratios observed in the wim ( e.g. , domgrgen & mathis 1994 ; greenawalt , walterbos , & braun 1997 ; martin 1997 ; wang , heckman , & lehnert 1998 ) . however , the models have failed to explain observed _ variations _ in some of the ratios .",
    "for example , rand ( 1998 ) observed that [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 and [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 increase with increasing distance @xmath12z@xmath12 from the midplane of ngc 891 , having values of 0.2 and 0.35 , respectively , near z = 0 , and 0.6 and 1.0 , respectively , near @xmath12z@xmath12 = 2000 pc . to account for such large ratios at high @xmath12z@xmath12 , rand had to adopt a hard stellar spectrum ( an upper imf cutoff of 120 m@xmath13 ) plus additional hardening as the radiation propagated away from the midplane .",
    "however , a hard spectrum appears to be inconsistent with he  i @xmath115876 recombination line observations ( rand 1998 , 1997 , and references therein ) .",
    "more significantly , the models fail to account for the fact that , while the variations in [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 and [",
    "n  ii]/h@xmath0 are large , [ s  ii]/[n  ii ] remains nearly constant . a similar behavior for [ s  ii ] , [ n  ii ] , and h@xmath0 has been observed in other galaxies ( e.g. , golla , dettmar , & domgrgen 1996 ; otte & dettmar 1999 ) as well as in the milky way ( haffner , reynolds , & tufte 1999 ) .",
    "golla et al ( 1996 ) and rand ( 1998 ) have pointed out that the constant value of [ s  ii]/[n  ii ] can not be reproduced by photoionization models , because in these models variations in [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 and [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 are primarily the result of variations in the ionization parameter u , which always produce larger changes in [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 than in [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the different ionization potentials of s and n , with the result that sulfur can be primarily s@xmath14 or primarily s@xmath15 , depending on the spectrum and strength of the radiation field , whereas nitrogen remains primarily n@xmath14 under nearly all wim conditions ( e.g. , howk & savage 1999 ) .",
    "another observation that pure photoionization models fail to reproduce is the rise in [ o  iii]/h@xmath16 with increasing @xmath12z@xmath12 , or increasing [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 and [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 ( rand 1998 , greenawalt et al 1997 ) . in ngc 891 , for example , the [ o  iii]/h@xmath16 intensity ratio more than doubles from 0.3 at z = 0 to about 0.75 a @xmath12z@xmath12 = 2000 pc ( rand 1998 ) .",
    "the models predict the opposite trend .",
    "rand proposed an additional source of collisional ionization at high @xmath12z@xmath12 to account for the enhanced [ o  iii ] intensity , but emphasized that this would still not explain the constancy of the [ s  ii]/[n  ii ] ratio .",
    "we show that these line ratio variations could be explained by the existence of an additional source of heat in the diffuse ionized gas . in the following sections we use recent emission line data for the milky way , obtained with the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) spectrometer , to derive the required heating rates and place constraints on possible supplemental heating mechanisms .",
    "haffner et al ( 1999 ) have shown that these emission line observations can be readily explained if the large variations in [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 and [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 are due primarily to variations in the electron temperature t@xmath1 rather than to variations in the ionization parameter u. the constancy of [ s  ii]/[n  ii ] is then a consequence of the fact that the two lines have nearly the same excitation energy .",
    "such temperature variations could also produce increases in [ o  iii]/h@xmath16 , perhaps eliminating the need for a secondary source of ionization . for the milky way , haffner et al ( 1999 ) found that an increase in t@xmath1 from 7000 k at @xmath12z@xmath12 = 500 pc to approximately 10,000 k at 1500 pc would produce the observed factor of three increases in the [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 and [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 ratios while keeping [ s  ii]/[n  ii ] constant .",
    "elevated temperatures have also been proposed by bland - hawthorn , freeman , & quinn ( 1997 ) to account for the anomalously high [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 in the diffuse gas at the outer edge of the disk of ngc 253 .",
    "they concluded that the high ratio could not be explained by photoionization alone , but required an additional heat source at large galactic radius that would `` selectively heat the electrons without producing a higher ionization state of nitrogen . ''",
    "these emission line data suggest that the regions with higher [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 and [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 ratios ( i.e. , higher temperatures ) are regions not just at larger distances @xmath12z@xmath12 from the galactic midplane , but more generally are regions with lower electron density .",
    "this is indicated by the strong anticorrelation between these line ratios and the h@xmath0 intensity .",
    "this anticorrelation is apparent not only in the data showing increasing ratios with increasing @xmath12z@xmath12 , but also in observations at constant @xmath12z@xmath12 ( e.g. , rand 1998 ; otte & dettmar 1999 ; domgrgen & dettmar 1997 ; golla et al 1996 ; ferguson , wyse , & gallagher 1996 ) and at large galactocentric radii ( bland - hawthorn et al 1997 ) . a strong anticorrelation is also found in the observations of the milky way ( haffner 1999 ; haffner et al 1999 ) , again , not only with increasing @xmath12z@xmath12 , but also for lines of sight that sample just the relatively low @xmath12z@xmath12 gas in the local orion arm .",
    "since it is difficult to see how the integration length could affect the temperature , we conclude that variations that are correlated with h@xmath0 intensity ( i.e. , emission measure ) are actually variations correlated with density .",
    "if the temperature in fact varies inversely with density in the diffuse ionized gas , then there must be an additional heat source that dominates over ionization heating at low densities .",
    "the heating rate per unit volume from photoionization is limited by recombination and is thus proportional to n@xmath2 .",
    "the cooling rate per unit volume depends upon electron - ion collisions and is also proportional to n@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , with only photoionization , t@xmath1 is nearly independent of n@xmath1 ( although the density dependence of the ion ratios will have some effect on the equilibrium temperature ) .",
    "however , if an additional heating term were added that was proportional to n@xmath1 , or did not depend upon density at all , it would dominate at sufficiently low densities , increasing the equilibrium temperature and producing an inverse relationship between t@xmath1 and n@xmath1 ( reynolds & cox 1992 ) .",
    "this additional heating term would decouple the heating of the gas from its ionization , driving up the the intensities of [ s  ii ] and [ n  ii ] relative to h@xmath0 while not affecting the ionization states of s and n , i.e. , allowing the [ s  ii]/[n  ii ] ratio to remain constant .",
    "such heat sources in the wim may include , for example , photoelectric heating by dust , the dissipation of interstellar turbulence , and coulomb collisions with cosmic rays , which are proportional to n@xmath1 ( draine 1978 ; minter & balser 1997 ; skibo , ramaty , & purcell 1996 ) , and magnetic field reconnection , which may be nearly independent of density ( gonalves , jatenco - pereira , & opher 1993 ) .",
    "the heating rates due to both photoionization and the supplemental source can be estimated by fitting the predicted variation in [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 with temperature to the observed variation in this line ratio .",
    "this can be done for the perseus spiral arm of the milky way , where the associated optical emission lines have been kinematically identified and observed to high galactic latitude with the wham spectrometer ( haffner 1999 ; haffner et al 1999 ) . as a result , these perseus arm observations provide both line intensity ratios and electron densities as a function of distance from the galactic midplane .",
    "figure 1 presents the electron temperatures t@xmath1 vs @xmath12z@xmath12 derived from these [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 data and the relationship between t@xmath1 and [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 given by    @xmath17}}{i_{\\mathrm{h}\\alpha } } = 1.63 \\times 10 ^ 5 \\ , \\left ( \\frac{\\mathrm{n}^+}{\\mathrm{n } } \\right ) \\ , \\left ( \\frac{\\mathrm{h}^+}{\\mathrm{h } } \\right)^{-1 } \\ ,   \\left ( \\frac{\\mathrm{n}}{\\mathrm{h } } \\right ) \\ , t^{0.426}_{4 } \\ , e^{-2.18/t_4},\\ ] ]     + where @xmath18 is t@xmath1 in units of 10@xmath19 k , n / h is the gas phase abundance of nitrogen , and n@xmath14/h and h@xmath14/h are the fraction of nitrogen and hydrogen , respectively , that is singly ionized . since n@xmath14/n @xmath20 h@xmath14/h ( e.g. , howk & savage 1999 ;",
    "haffner et al 1999 ) and n / h @xmath21 @xmath22 ( meyer , cardelli , & sofia 1997 ) , equation ( 1 ) can be rewritten simply as    @xmath17}}{i_{\\mathrm{h}\\alpha } } = 12.2 \\ , t^{0.426}_{4 } \\ ,",
    "e^{-2.18/t_4}.\\ ] ]    equation ( 2 ) and the plot of [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 vs galactic latitude presented in figure  8 of haffner et al ( 1999 ) were then combined to produce the t@xmath1 vs @xmath12z@xmath12 relation for the perseus arm in figure 1 .",
    "this result covers the galactic latitude range @xmath23 averaged over the longitude interval @xmath24 .",
    "the distance to the perseus arm is assumed to be 2.5 kpc ( reynolds et al 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "the electron density n@xmath1 within the wim at a distance @xmath12z@xmath12 from the midplane can be derived from the h@xmath0 intensity , which is related to the emission measure em through the relation em = 2.75 @xmath25 ( from martin 1988 ) , where em (= @xmath26 ds ) is in units of @xmath27 pc and @xmath28 is in rayleighs ( 1 r = 10@xmath29/4@xmath30 photons @xmath31 s@xmath5 sr@xmath5 ) . along the line of sight through the perseus arm , em can be expressed as n@xmath32l , where l is the path length through the arm , @xmath33 the fraction of l occupied by ionized hydrogen , and n@xmath1 the rms electron density within the ionized regions .",
    "haffner et al ( 1999 ) showed that for the same ranges of @xmath34 and @xmath35 represented in figure 1 , @xmath36(@xmath12z@xmath12 ) @xmath21 5.7 e@xmath37 r. therefore , if l is assumed to have a value of 1000 pc ( see fig . 1 in becker & fenkart 1970 )",
    ",    @xmath38    we consider two situations : 1 ) a constant filling fraction @xmath33 = 0.2 ( reynolds 1991 ) , and 2 ) a filling fraction that increases with @xmath12z@xmath12 according to the relation given by kulkarni & heiles ( 1987 ) , that is , @xmath39 for @xmath40 pc . there is some evidence that @xmath33 does in fact increase with distance from the midplane ( reynolds 1991 ) ; however , the results are sufficiently uncertain that both a constant and varying @xmath33 are considered here .",
    "we assume that the temperature is determined by a balance between the cooling rate per unit volume ( @xmath41n@xmath42 ) in the diffuse ionized gas and two heating rates : the net heating by photoionization , given by g@xmath43n@xmath42 , plus an additional heating term , given either by g@xmath44n@xmath1 or by just a constant g@xmath45 .",
    "the heating  cooling balance can then be expressed as either @xmath46 , or @xmath47 , representing , for example , supplemental heating by turbulent dissipation ( g@xmath48 ) , or by magnetic field reconnection ( g@xmath49 ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , depending upon the values of g@xmath48 or g@xmath49 relative to g@xmath43 , significantly increased heating ( relative to photoionization ) can occur as the density decreases .",
    "this will result in higher equilibrium temperatures at lower densities .",
    "we have adopted the cooling function @xmath41 for low density photoionized gas given in osterbrock ( 1989 ) .",
    "while this particular cooling function may not be exactly appropriate for the wim , for t@xmath50 7000 k ( the temperature range considered here ) it is a very good approximation , because like the model h ii region in osterbrock , the wim s cooling function is dominated by [ o  ii ] and [ n  ii ] . an equilibrium temperature for each value of @xmath12z@xmath12",
    "can be computed from equation ( 3 ) and one of the above heating  cooling balance equations .",
    "the values of g@xmath43 and g@xmath48 , or g@xmath43 and g@xmath49 , can then be adjusted to fit the t@xmath1 vs @xmath12z@xmath12 distribution in figure 1 .",
    "the best - fit values are listed in table 1 for four cases : ( a ) supplemental heating g@xmath48n@xmath1 and constant @xmath33 ; ( b ) supplemental heating g@xmath49 and constant @xmath33 ; ( c ) supplemental heating g@xmath48n@xmath1 and a variable @xmath51z@xmath12 ) ; and ( d ) supplemental heating g@xmath49 and variable @xmath51z@xmath12 ) .",
    "the associated best - fit curves are also plotted on figure 1 for comparison with t@xmath1 vs @xmath12z@xmath12 inferred from the observed [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 ratios in the perseus arm .",
    "note that the derived values for g@xmath48 and g@xmath49 are proportional to l@xmath52 and l@xmath5 , respectively , where l is the assumed path length through the perseus arm .",
    "also , haffner et al ( 1999 ) discussed the possible contamination of the [ n  ii ] spectra by a weak atmospheric emission line .",
    "if this line is present with the intensity of their upper limit ( 0.1 r ) , then the best fit values for g@xmath48 and g@xmath49 would be 20%  30% lower than those presented in table 1 , while g@xmath43 would be less affected .",
    "figure 1 shows that all four cases give good fits to the inferred t@xmath1 vs @xmath12z@xmath12 distribution , within the uncertainty implied by the jaggedness of the distribution .",
    "therefore , a supplemental heat source with a heating rate per unit volume proportional to n@xmath53 or n@xmath54 could account for the observed variations in the line intensity ratios .",
    "moreover , these results place tight constraints on the required rates , implying a photoionization heating rate coefficient g@xmath55 @xmath56 ergs @xmath57 s@xmath5 , and a supplemental rate coefficient of either g@xmath44 @xmath3 ergs s@xmath5 or g@xmath45 @xmath7 few @xmath58 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath5 .",
    "thus for n@xmath1 greater than 1 @xmath4 , the heating rate per unit volume is dominated by photoionization , while below 0.1  0.04 @xmath4 , the supplemental heating dominates .",
    "this value for g@xmath55 corresponds to a stellar ionizing spectrum with t@xmath59 @xmath20 30,000  35,000 k ( osterbrock 1989 ) , i.e. , late o to early b , and is consistent with the observations of weak he i recombination line emission from the wim ( tufte 1997 , reynolds & tufte 1995 ; heiles et al 1996 )",
    ".    values of g@xmath44 near 1 @xmath60 ergs s@xmath5 ( table 1 ) have in fact been predicted for the wim in the milky way by models of photoelectric grain heating ( reynolds & cox 1992 ; draine 1978 ) and by models of the dissipation of interstellar turbulence ( minter & spangler 1997 ) . at electron temperatures above 8000 k",
    "the net heating by grains decreases sharply due to cooling by electron",
    " grain collisions ( draine 1978 ) , and , therefore , this process is not likely to account for the 9,000  k  11,000  k temperatures at high @xmath12z@xmath12 , unless photoelectric heating in the wim is dominated by large molecules ( e.g. , pahs ) ( lepp & dalgarno 1988 ) .",
    "minter & spangler ( 1997 ) , on the other hand , have predicted an energy dissipation rate of approximately 1 @xmath61n@xmath1 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath5 due to ion ",
    "neutral collisional dampening in the milky way s nearly fully ionized 10@xmath19 k wim .",
    "they concluded that the dissipation of turbulence probably plays a major role in heating the wim and contributing to the [ s  ii ] and [ n  ii ] emission ( see also minter & balser 1997 and tufte , reynolds , & haffner 1999 ) .",
    "another potential source is coulomb collisions by cosmic rays , which according to some interpretations of the galactic @xmath62-ray background , could deposit significant power into the interstellar gas ( e.g. , skibo et al 1996 ; valinia & marshall 1998 ) .    a heating mechanism that is independent of density ( curves b and d in fig .",
    "1 ) could also account for these temperature variations .",
    "one such mechanism is magnetic field reconnection ( raymond 1992 ; birk , lesch , & neukirch 1998 ; gonalves et al 1993 ) . a field strength as high as 7 @xmath63 g ( webber 1998 ; heiles 1995 ) and a time scale of 10@xmath64 yr for the amplification of the field by the galactic dynamo ( raymond 1992 , and references therein ) would provide an average power of 6 @xmath65 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , a rate that is a factor of 2.5 to 13 below the values for g@xmath45 given in table 1 but approximately the rate that is needed , if reconnection occurred only within the more limited volume of the wim .",
    "the anticorrelation between h@xmath0 intensity and the line intensity ratios [ n  ii]/h@xmath0 and [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 , as well as the constancy of [ n  ii]/[s  ii ] in the diffuse ionized gas of the milky way and other galaxies can be explained if the electron temperature t@xmath1 increases with decreasing density n@xmath1 .",
    "an inverse relationship between t@xmath1 and n@xmath1 would imply that , in addition to photoionization , which heats at a rate proportional to n@xmath2 , there is an additional source that is proportional to a lower power of n@xmath1 .    in the milky way the dissipation of interstellar turbulence , with a predicted rate @xmath3 n@xmath1 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath5 in the wim ( minter & spangler 1998 ) , may be the source of this additional heating , raising the possibility that the observed increases in forbidden line intensities ( relative to h@xmath0 ) in galactic halos is the final step in a turbulent energy cascade that begins with large scale motions of the interstellar gas . however , other mechanisms , such as heating by pahs , magnetic reconnection , or cosmic rays are also possible provided that within the wim they have a rate coefficient of the magnitude listed in table 1 .",
    "measurements of higher t@xmath1 in regions with higher [ n ii]/h@xmath0 and [ s  ii]/h@xmath0 would provide strong , independent support for the existence of such supplemental heating .",
    "these measurements could perhaps be made through accurate observations of the h@xmath0 , [ n  ii ] , and [ s  ii ] line widths ( e.g. , reynolds 1985 ) , or through observations of other emission lines such as [ o  ii ] @xmath113727 and the extremely faint [ n  ii ] @xmath115755 line , which have higher excitation energies , and thus are more temperature sensitive , than [ n  ii ] @xmath116584 and [ s  ii ] @xmath116716 ( see ferguson et al 1996 ) .",
    "we hope to begin some of these investigations in the near future ."
