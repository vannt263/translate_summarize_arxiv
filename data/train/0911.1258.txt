    "type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) have proven to be very good standard candles for cosmological studies .",
    "they are bright enough to detect at cosmological distances , @xmath3 , if one uses 810  m class ground - based optical telescopes or the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and their luminosities can be standardised using empirical relations between luminosity and light curve shape ( @xcite ) and colour @xcite .",
    "sne  ia have played a leading role in measuring the expansion history of the universe since two independent teams , the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) and the high-@xmath4 team , discovered the accelerating expansion of the universe ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . since then , many projects to discover and identify sne  ia have been organized .",
    "for example , the carnegie supernova project ( csp ; @xcite ) , the nearby supernova factory ( snfactory ; @xcite ) , the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) supernova survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the sloan digital sky survey - ii supernova survey ( sdss - ii sn survey ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the supernova legacy survey ( snls ; @xcite ) , the equation of state : supernovae trace cosmic expansion ( essence ) survey ( @xcite ) , and higher - z team ( @xcite ) have detected around 1000 sne up to redshift @xmath5 .",
    "the combination of sn  ia data with measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ; @xcite ) and galaxy cluster number counts ( @xcite ) have constrained the dark energy equation of state parameter .",
    "however , the limits are consistent with very different dark energy models , so the fundamental nature of dark energy remains unclear .",
    "it is currently one of the biggest mysteries in physics , and combined astronomical observations ( sne  ia , cmb , bao and weak lensing ) seem to be the only way to constrain its properties .    since the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe",
    ", the scp has been carrying out imaging surveys for sne  ia at @xmath6 , an epoch during which the expansion of the universe is expected to be decelerating .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up observations are an essential part of these surveys , providing spectroscopically determined redshifts and , when necessary and possible , direct confirmation of the sn type . in this paper",
    ", we present spectra of sne and their host galaxies taken with the faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ; @xcite ) on the subaru 8.2-m telescope .",
    "twelve sn candidates shown here were found in ground - based observations targeting blank fields and nearby galaxy clusters with suprime - cam ( @xcite ) on subaru and the cfh12k camera ( @xcite ) on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the remaining 27 sn candidates were discovered using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; @xcite ) on hst targeting high redshift galaxy clusters in a program called the hst cluster sn survey ( program number 10496 , pi : perlmutter ) .",
    "these sn searches specifically targeted @xmath0 sne  ia , for which there have been relatively few spectroscopically confirmed sne  ia ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in  [ sec : observationanddata ] , we summarize the sn searches and present data for both imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "spectroscopic data reductions are described in  [ sec : observationanddata ] .",
    "sn and host galaxy classifications are shown in  [ sec : sntyping ] and  [ sec : focashostspectraforhstclustersn ] , respectively . in ",
    "[ sec : typeideff ] , we describe factors that influence the classification of sne . ",
    "[ sec : summary ] is a summary of the paper .",
    "we use the standard @xmath7cdm cosmological parameters of @xmath8 for calculating the age of the universe at a certain redshift .",
    "all magnitudes are measured in the ab system .",
    "the spectroscopic observations described in this paper were carried out during our sn campaigns that were specifically targeting @xmath0 sne ia .",
    "each campaign generally consisted of broad band imaging to discover sne  ia , spectroscopic follow - up to determine sn types and redshifts , and photometric follow - up to measure light curves . to first find and then effectively follow @xmath0 sne  ia , we used both wide - field imagers on ground - based telescopes , namely suprime - cam ( @xmath9 ) on the subaru telescope and the cfh12k camera ( @xmath10 ) on cfht , and acs ( @xmath11 ) on hst .",
    "sn candidates shown in this paper were found during 2001 , 2002 , 2005 and 2006 .",
    "our search for sne ia was conducted in a series of four campaigns .",
    "three of these were conducted with ground based facilities during the northern spring of 2001 , the northern spring of 2002 and the northern fall of 2002 .",
    "the fourth was an acs search conducted during 2005 and 2006 .",
    "some campaigns consisted of multiple searches with several instruments .",
    "details of the searches are given in table  [ tab : tab_searchobservation ] .",
    "additional details can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and are briefly summarised here .",
    "some of the sn discoveries were reported in iau circulars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the subaru suprime - cam campaign conducted in the spring of 2001 was a pilot search for later sn searches with this instrument . the relatively wide field - of - view and",
    "the high sensitivity provided by suprime - cam enables the discovery of high - redshift sne more effectively than acs @xcite .",
    "only two- or three - epochs were taken with suprime - cam , which means that these data are not , by themselves , enough to derive light curves , although one candidate was followed with wfpc2 on hst @xcite .",
    "the search fields were centered on two galaxy clusters , cl 1604 + 4321 ( @xmath12 ; @xcite ) and ms 1520.1 + 3002 ( @xmath13 ; @xcite ) , and several blank fields , such as the subaru deep field ( sdf ; @xcite ) .",
    "the sdf observations were carried out as a part of the sdf project .",
    "the imaging data for the sn searches were obtained in either the @xmath14 or @xmath15 filters .",
    "typical exposure times and limiting magnitudes for each epoch were one hour and @xmath16 mag .",
    "sne found in these campaigns are named [ field]-[sn  i d ] or [ field][sn  i d ] .",
    "the suprime - cam data are very useful for investigating sn rates even though there are only 2 or 3 epochs . by combining suprime - cam data in abell 2152 @xcite , @xcite obtained sn rates for both sne  ia and core - collapse sne , and , by using a theoretical model that relates sne rate to the star formation rate @xcite , the cosmic star formation history .",
    "this provides an estimate that is independent of galaxy studies .",
    "it also takes advantage of the fact that sne can trace star formation activity even though galaxies are either too diffuse or too faint to detect . using well - sampled light curves from the sxds data ( @xcite and  .[sec : sxdf ] of this paper ) , the cosmological evolution of the sn  ia rate can be measured ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .      the spring 2002 campaign consisted of four searches ; two searches with subaru , a cfht search , and a ctio search @xcite .",
    "the two subaru searches used suprime - cam , were done back - to - back and searched for sne  ia in the sdf field , two fields surrounding the sdf field ( sdfe and sdfw , which are to the east and west of the sdf , respectively ) , and four other blank fields ( ss1 , ss2 , ss3 , and ss4 ) .",
    "the cfht search was a rolling search , which was similar to the one subsequently done by the snls @xcite where each field was observed 3 to 4 times per lunation over a period of several lunations .",
    "these kinds of searches automatically provide well - sampled light curves of discovered transients .",
    "we did not follow ctio candidates with focas .",
    "sne discovered in this search are reported in @xcite .",
    "sn candidates found in this campaign were named s02-[sn",
    "i d ] and c02-[sn  i d ] for the subaru and cfht searches , respectively .",
    "followup imaging observations of several high - redshift sne were obtained with hst / acs and two ground based ir instruments : isaac ( infrared spectrometer and array camera ; @xcite ) on the vlt and niri ( near infrared imager and spectrometer ; @xcite ) on gemini - north .",
    "these observations will be reported in suzuki et al .",
    "( in preparation )      in the fall 2002 campaign , we took multi - epoch @xmath15-band images of five fields with suprime - cam ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fields were centered on the subaru / xmm - newton deep field ( sxdf ) . the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey",
    "( sxds ) project ( @xcite ; @xcite ) has taken deep multi - wavelength data , from x - ray to radio , of this region .",
    "compared to earlier subaru campaigns , the search and follow - up of candidates discovered during the fall 2002 campaign was more comprehensive .",
    "reference images taken during the end of september 2002 were compared with search images that were taken during the beginning of november 2002 .",
    "the typical exposure time was one hour and the limiting magnitude was @xmath17 mag .",
    "the deep and wide - field suprime - cam data provided us with @xmath18 variable objects over a timescale of 1 month ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "follow - up imaging observations of several high - redshift sne were carried out using hst / acs in the optical and nicmos ( near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ; @xcite ) on hst in the near infrared .",
    "we also obtained ground - based near - infrared @xmath19-band imaging data of one candidate with both cisco ( cooled infrared spectrograph and camera for oh - airglow suppressor ( @xcite , @xcite ) ) on the subaru telescope and vlt / isaac .",
    "these observations will be reported in suzuki et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "sn candidates found in this campaign are named suf02-[sn  i d ] .",
    "the hst cluster supernova survey was conducted in 2005 and 2006 with acs on hst ( @xcite ) .",
    "the targeted fields were galaxy clusters at @xmath20 .",
    "galaxy clusters are rich in early - type galaxies , which are expected to have little dust . in current sn  ia cosmological studies , the systematic uncertainty in the correction for dust attenuation is comparable to statistical uncertainties .",
    "for example , it is not clear if the extinction law is universal or unevolving .",
    "the most straightforward way to avoid ( or reduce ) this systematic error is to find sne  ia in dust - free environments . also , the dispersion in the corrected peak @xmath21-band luminosity of sne  ia in early - type galaxies is smaller than that in late - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . therefore , we searched for sne ia in early - type galaxies by targeting galaxy clusters , which is an effective way of finding a large number of early type galaxies at high redshift in small fields of view .",
    "another advantage in targeting early - type galaxies , where star - forming activities have been quenched , is that sne found in such galaxies are expected to be sne  ia with high probability , as there should be no core - collapse sne in these galaxies .    in total ,",
    "25 high redshift galaxy clusters were targeted .",
    "typical exposure times and limiting magnitudes for each epoch were 30 minutes and f850lp ( @xmath22 ) @xmath23 mag , respectively .",
    "the clusters were also observed using the acs f775w ( @xmath24 ) filter and active high redshift sne were observed with the f110w filter on nicmos .",
    "the sn candidates found in this campaign are named scp[year][cluster id][sn i d ] where `` year '' corresponds to the year of discovery , `` cluster i d '' is a letter arbitrarily assigned to each cluster for scheduling purposes , and `` sn  i d '' is a number assigned to each sn within a cluster according to its time of discovery in the search .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up is used to obtain redshifts and , if the sn phase was near maximum light , the sn type .",
    "the candidates observed with focas are summarized in tables [ tab : obssummary1 ] and [ tab : obssummary2 ] .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up was also done with other facilities and is reported elsewhere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . during the fall 2002 campaign , the subaru telescope was used mainly for discovering sne , so the number of sn candidates observed spectroscopically with focas was small for this particular campaign .",
    "we used the long slit mode of focas until december 2005 and then mainly the multi - object slit mode after that .",
    "there are two reasons for the change .",
    "first , candidates from the hst cluster supernova survey campaign were faint , which increased the difficulty in acquiring these targets with the long slit mode .",
    "the multi - object slitmasks can be manufactured to include several alignment holes to catch bright stars within the focas fov ( 6 diameter ) , thus enabling us to center targets more precisely .",
    "slitmask observations also allow us to observe additional targets , such as cluster members , at the same time ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . also ,",
    "improvements in the mask alignment software by the focas instrument team allowed us to acquire targets more quickly . slit widths were 08 in most of the observations .",
    "when the seeing was poor , slit widths of 10 were used .",
    "the atmospheric dispersion corrector was used in all observations .",
    "combinations of grisms and order - sort filters are 300b and sy47 , or 300r and so58 , which result in spectra covering the 4700 - 9000  and 5800 - 10000  regions , respectively .",
    "each exposure lasted 20 to 30 minutes .",
    "the objects were dithered by several arcseconds over several positions along the slit in order to effectively remove bad pixels , cosmic rays , and detector fringes .",
    "exposure times varied with target brightness and priority .",
    "typically , the seeing was 06 to 10 and total exposure times were 1 - 3 hours .",
