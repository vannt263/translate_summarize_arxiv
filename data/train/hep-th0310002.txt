    "a regular graph is a combinatorial structure consisting of a set @xmath1 of @xmath2 vertices , connected by edges .",
    "two vertices are called neighbors of they are connected by an edge ; the graph is @xmath0-regular if each vertex has exactly @xmath0 neighbors .",
    "to such a graph one associates a combinatorial laplacian , which operates on functions on the vertices by giving the sum of the differences between the values of a function @xmath3 at a vertex and its neighbors : @xmath4 the sum being over all neighbors of the vertex @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath2 eigenvalues @xmath6 lie in the interval between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "if we take a sequence of graphs with the number of vertices @xmath9 , then under certain conditions ( see section [ sec : surv ] ) there is a limiting density of states analogous to weyl s law .",
    "this gives a mean counting function @xmath10 , the expected number of levels below @xmath11 , which we can use to measure the fluctuation properties of the eigenvalues in a large graph . if we `` unfold '' the sequence of eigenvalues ( for instance by setting @xmath12 ) , then we get a sequence @xmath13 with mean spacing unity : @xmath14 .",
    "the distribution function of the spacings @xmath15  @xmath16  is called the _ level spacing distribution _ of the graph .",
    "it is one of several quantities used to measure the statistical fluctuations of a spectrum .",
    "we wish to examine it in the limit as we increase the number of vertices to infinity .",
    "our motivation for studying these spectral fluctuations comes from the theory of quantum chaos , where one studies fluctuations of energy levels of dynamical systems , for instance the spectrum of the laplacian of a manifold ( where the classical motion is the geodesic flow ) .",
    "it has been conjectured that generically there is a remarkable dichotomy :    1 .",
    "if the classical dynamics are * completely integrable * , then berry and tabor @xcite conjectured that the fluctuations are the same as those of an uncorrelated sequence of levels , and in particular @xmath17 is poissonian .",
    "2 .   if the classical dynamics are * chaotic * then bohigas , giannoni and schmit @xcite , @xcite conjectured that the fluctuations are modeled by the eigenvalues of a large random symmetric matrix - the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe )",
    ".    that is , the statistics of the spectral fluctuations are * universal * in each of the two classes .    while some obvious counter - examples exist , such as the sphere in the integrable case ( the levels are @xmath18 with multiplicity @xmath19 ) , and more subtle examples in the chaotic case , such as the modular surface ( the quotient of the upper half - plane by the modular group @xmath20 ) , where the spacings appear to be poissonian @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , there is sufficient numerical evidence for us to believe that these universality conjectures hold in the generic case .    in the hope of gaining some extra insight into this matter we checked fluctuation properties of the spectrum of a regular graph .",
    "graphs , for us , will occupy an intermediate step between quantizations of genuine chaotic dynamical systems and the statistical models of random matrix theory . while we have no direct interpretation of graphs in terms of classical mechanics ,",
    "an analogy is the random walk on a graph : starting with an initial probability distribution , a particle at a given vertex moves to one its its neighbors with equal probability .",
    "this substitute for dynamics is * chaotic * in the following sense : the walk is recurrent if the graph is connected ( which we interpret as ergodicity ) , and in that case is mixing if the graph is not bipartite . in the bipartite case ,",
    "the set of vertices is a union of two disjoint sets ( inputs and outputs ) so that inputs can only be connected to outputs and vice - versa .",
    "thus if we start from an input vertex and walk any even number of steps then we will only be able to land on another input , never on an output .",
    "there are examples ( such as some cayley graphs , see @xcite , @xcite ) where there are systematic multiplicities in the spectrum and the level spacing distribution at best exists only in some singular limit .",
    "for instance in the case of cayley graphs of the cyclic group @xmath21 the appropriate limit gives a * rigid * spectrum : @xmath22 , so that @xmath23 is a dirac delta function .",
    "another special example , analogous to the modular surface , seems to have poisson spacings ( numerical evidence by rockmore @xcite ) .",
    "these examples have certain symmetries or degeneracies .",
    "we tested a number of families of generic ( pseudo)-random @xmath0-regular graphs ( see section [ sec : gen ] for the details of the generation algorithm ) .",
    "the numerical evidence we accumulated , described in section [ sec : exper ] , indicates that the resulting family of graphs have goe spacings .",
    "this should be compared with the numerical investigations by evangelou @xcite which indicate that in the case of * sparse * random symmetric matrices the spacings are goe .",
    "we are thus led to conjecture that for a fixed degree @xmath24 , the eigenvalues of the generic @xmath0-regular graph on a large number of vertices have fluctuations which tend to those of goe ( see section [ sec : exper ] for a more precise statement ) .",
    "the purpose of our paper is not only to describe our experimental results , but also to give a brief survey of the theory of quantum chaos for graph theorists , and of a bit of relevant graph theory of experts in quantum chaos .",
    "accordingly , we included a survey of background material on graphs and their spectra in section [ sec : surv ] , and a brief overview of random matrix theory in section [ rmt ] . in section [ sec : gen ]",
    "we present the method used for generating graphs , and in section [ sec : exper ] the results of our experiments .",
    "we thank n.  alon , m.  krivelevich , p.  sarnak and b.  sudakov for helpful conversations , and a.  odlyzko for providing routines to aid in the numerical computation of the goe distribution .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that the utility of rmt lies in that the predicted level spacing distribution @xmath126 and correlation functions are model - independent and appear in many instances , both probabilistic and deterministic , independent of features such as the level density .",
    "for instance , numerical studies indicate that _ sparse _ random matrices have goe spacings @xcite , and the experiments described in the following section indicate that the same is true for eigenvalues of random regular graphs .",
    "we generated random @xmath0-regular graphs using a method described in @xcite .",
    "this method has the virtues of the ease of implementation and of being extremely efficient for the small ( @xmath127 ) values of @xmath0 of current interest to us . on the other hand",
    ", the running time of the algorithm grows exponentially with the degree @xmath0 , and ( at least in our implementation ) was found impractical for @xmath128 on the hardware which we used .",
    "it should be noted that in the same paper @xcite , wormald describes an algorithm which scales well with @xmath0 , but is much more cumbersome to implement and slower for small @xmath0 .",
    "wormald s algorithm is easiest explained in terms of generating random bipartite graphs with prescribed vertex degrees .",
    "assume that we wish to generate a random bipartite graph @xmath25 with @xmath129 blue vertices , named @xmath130 , and @xmath131 red vertices , named @xmath132 .",
    "we would like the vertex @xmath133 to have degree @xmath39 , while the vertex @xmath134 has degree @xmath135 evidently , we must have @xmath136 .",

    "now , we permute the @xmath143 cells of @xmath137 by a random permutation in @xmath144 , to get another array @xmath145 the array @xmath146 defines a bipartite ( multi)graph @xmath147 as follows : the neighbors of @xmath148 are the first @xmath149 entries of @xmath146 , the neighbors of @xmath150 are the next @xmath151 entries , and so on .",
    "it is possible that @xmath147 is a multigraph , since two of the neighbors of some @xmath133 might well be the same . if that turns out to be the case , we scrap @xmath146 , and generate another random permutation , and thus another random array @xmath152 , and corresponding multigraph @xmath153 , and so on , until we have a true bipartite graph .",
    "it is clear that if the valences @xmath39 and @xmath40 are small , this process has a good chance of converging in reasonable time , and it should also be intuitively fairly clear that each bipartite graph with prescribed degrees is equally likely to appear .",
    "both statements are proved in @xcite .",
    "the problem of generating a random @xmath0-regular graph can , in effect , be reduced to the previous problem of generating a random bipartite graph . to wit , to each graph @xmath25",
    "we associate a bipartite graph @xmath154 , such that @xmath155 , where the blue vertices of @xmath154 correspond to the vertices of @xmath25 , while the red vertices correspond to the edges of @xmath25 .",
    "a vertex @xmath26 is connected to @xmath30 in @xmath154 , whenever @xmath30 is incident to @xmath26 in @xmath25 .",
    "a @xmath0-regular @xmath25 gives rise to a graph @xmath154 , where the blue vertices have degree @xmath0 , while the red vertices have degree @xmath156 . on the other hand , not every bipartite @xmath110 with degrees as",
    "above arises as @xmath154 for some @xmath0-regular graph @xmath25 , since if @xmath110 has two red vertices @xmath140 and @xmath142 such that the blue neighbors of @xmath140 are the same as those of @xmath142 , the corresponding @xmath25 is , in actuality , a multigraph .",
    "the algorithm can thus be summarized as follows : to generate a random @xmath0-regular graph with @xmath51 vertices , first generate a random bipartite graph @xmath110 with @xmath51 blue vertices of degree @xmath0 and @xmath157 vertices of degree @xmath156 . if @xmath158 for some ( obviously unique ) graph @xmath25 , then return @xmath25 , else try again .",
    "the expected running time of this process is analyzed , and the uniformity of the results is proved in @xcite .",
    "_ evidently , this method is even better suited to generating random _ bipartite _ graphs with a prescribed degree sequence .",
    "we have used the algorithm to generate random @xmath159-regular and @xmath160-regular bipartite graphs .",
    "the experimental results were not substantively different from those for general regular graphs ( as described below ) .",
    "once we had the adjacency matrices of the graphs constructed by the above method , we computed their eigenvalues .",
    "the spectral densities of a couple of families  one of @xmath159-regular graphs and another of @xmath160-regular graphs  are displayed in figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) against mckay s law .        to -50pt to we tested the matter further by using a variant of the kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "one compares an empirical , sample distribution to an expected answer by measuring the deviation of the cumulative distribution functions of the two . recall that if @xmath161 , @xmath162 are random variables ( the spacings , in our case ) , the empirical distribution function is @xmath163 and its cumulative distribution function is @xmath164 . to test",
    "if the distribution function is given by a theoretical prediction @xmath165 , define the _ discrepancy _ @xmath166 or _ kolmogorov - smirnov statistic _ to be the supremum of @xmath167 over @xmath168 .",
    "the discrepancy is small if and only if the two distributions are close to each other . in the case that the @xmath161 are * independent * , identically distributed ( definitely not the case in hand ! ) with cumulative distribution function @xmath165 , the discrepancy goes to zero almost surely as @xmath112 and there is a limit law giving the the limiting distribution @xmath169 of the normalized discrepancy @xmath170 as @xmath118 : @xmath171 in the case that the @xmath161 s are spacings of * uncorrelated * levels ( hence certainly not independent ! ) , the level spacing distribution is exponential @xmath17 as @xmath112 and pyke @xcite derives a limit law for the normalized discrepancy .    in the case where the @xmath161 s are spacings of certain models of rmt ( not goe , however ) , katz and sarnak @xcite prove that the discrepancy goes to zero almost surely as @xmath112 and conjecture that there is a limit law as in the case of kolmogorov - smirnov and pyke .",
    "miller ( work in progress ) has investigated this distribution for random symmetric and hermitian matrices and has numerically discovered that , after being normalized by multiplying by @xmath172 , it approaches a limiting distribution which seems independent of the type of matrix involved . in figure 3",
    "we show this cumulative distribution function @xmath173 of the normalized discrepancy for goe ( top plot ) against the kolmogorov - smirnov `` brownian bridge '' @xmath169 ( bottom plot ) and pyke s distribution for spacings of uncorrelated levels ( middle plot ) .",
