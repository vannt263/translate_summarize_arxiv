    "quantization of the gravitational field is one of most import problems in physics since the beginning of the 20th century .",
    "the long pursuit of a theory of quantum gravity have generated a variety of theoretical proposals to describe the quantum sector of gravity , see for instance loop quantum gravity @xcite , higher derivatives quantum gravity @xcite , causal sets @xcite , causal dynamical triangulations @xcite , string theory @xcite , asymptotic safety @xcite , emergent gravities @xcite , horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , topological gauge theories @xcite and so on .",
    "each one of these theories carries its own set of advantages and disadvantages . on the other hand ,",
    "gauge theories are relentless in describing the high energy regime of particle physics @xcite .",
    "hence , one can question if gravity could also be described by a gauge theory in its high energy sector .",
    "in fact , since the seminal papers @xcite about gauge theoretical descriptions of gravity , it is known that gravity can be , at least , dressed as a gauge theory for the local isometries of spacetime .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "although consistent with general relativity , these models also have problems with its quantization .    in @xcite",
    "it was proposed an induced gravity model from a pure yang - mills theory based on de sitter - type groups . in this model",
    ", gravity emerges as an effective phenomenon originated by a genuine yang - mills action in flat space .",
    "the transition between the quantum gauge sector and the classical geometrical sector is mediated by a mass parameter , identified with the gribov parameter @xcite .",
    "the combination of the running of this parameter and the running of the coupling parameter would provide a good scenario for an inn - wigner contraction @xcite of the gauge group , deforming it to a poincar - type group . because , the original action is not invariant under the resulting group , the model actually suffers a dynamical symmetry breaking to lorentz - type groups . at this point , with the help of the mass parameter , the gauge degrees of freedom are identified with geometrical objects , namely , the vierbein and spin - connection . at the same time the mass parameter and the coupling parameter are combined to generate the gravity newtonian constant and an emergent gravity is realized .",
    "moreover , a cosmological constant inherent to the model is also generated .",
    "see also @xcite for details .",
    "the aim of the present work is to provide estimates for the emergent parameters of the model above discussed by applying the usual aparathus of quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "we concentrate our efforts at 1 and 2-loops computations .",
    "in particular , from the explicit expressions of the running coupling and the gribov parameters , we are able to fit the actual value of newtonian constant and to obtain a renormalization group cut - off very close to the planck scale , as expected to be the transition scale from quantum to classical gravity .",
    "the cosmological constant is an essential point , which can be related with the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "observational data and quantum field theory prediction for the cosmological constant strongly disagree in numerical values @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we can expect that the cosmological parameter generated by the model should combine with the value found in theoretical calculations by quantum field theory in a way that the effective final value fits the observational data .",
    "it is worth mention that the cosmological parameter generated by the model is related with the gribov parameter @xcite . in @xcite , a preliminar estimative for these running parameters at 1-loop approximation",
    "was scratched . from this reasonable",
    "starting , we develop here a refinement on early predictions and we show a numerical improvements at 1-loop calculations .",
    "further , we improove the techniques up to 2-loops estimates .",
    "hence , we present a best estimative for the gribov parameter in order to fit the model with a suitable emergent gravity .    this work is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ efgrav ] we resume some concepts and ideas about our effective gravity model . in sect .",
    "[ 1loop ] , the first results that we obtained for 1-loop estimates . in sect .",
    "[ 2loop ] , we present the main calculations results for running parameters at 2-loops are performed . in last sect .",
    "[ final ] , we discuss shortly our results and some perspectives will be cast .",
    "in @xcite , a quantum gravity theory was constructed based on an analogy with quantum chromodynamics , see also @xcite . in this section",
    "we will briefly discuss the main ideas , definitions and conventions behind this model .",
    "the starting action is the yang - mills action , @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the field strength 2-form , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the exterior derivative , @xmath5 is the coupling parameter and @xmath6 is the gauge connection 1-form , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fundamental field in the adjoint representation . the hodge dual operator in @xmath7-dimensional euclidian spacetime is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "the action eq .   is invariant under @xmath0 gauge transformations , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "the infinitesimal version of the gauge transformation is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the full covariant derivative and @xmath13 is the infinitesimal gauge parameter .",
    "it is possible to decompose the gauge group according to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the stability group @xmath16 is the symmetric coset space .",
    "thus , defining @xmath17 , the gauge field is also decomposed , @xmath18 where capital latin indices @xmath19 run as @xmath20 and the small latin indices @xmath21 vary as @xmath22 .",
    "the decomposed field strength reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 e @xmath25 .",
    "thus , it is a simple task to find that the yang - mills action eq .",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath26    before we advance to next stage of the model , let us quickly point out some important aspects of yang - mills theories and their analogy with a possible quantum gravity model . to start with , yang - mills theories present two very important properties , namely , renormalizability and asymptotic freedom @xcite .",
    "the yang - mills action is in fact renormalizable , at least to all orders in perturbation theory @xcite which means that it is stable at quantum level . in this context , the so called brst symmetry has a fundamental hole .",
    "asymptotic freedom @xcite , on the other hand , means that , at high energies , the coupling parameter is very small and we can use perturbation theory in our favor .",
    "however , as the energy decreases , the coupling parameter increases and the theory becomes highly non - perturbative . in this regime ,",
    "the so called gribov ambiguities problem takes place @xcite .",
    "essentially , the gauge fixing is not strong enough to eliminate all spurious degrees of freedom from the faddeev - popov path integral ; a residual gauge symmetry survives the faddeev - popov procedure .",
    "the elimination of the gribov ambiguities is not entirely understood , however , it is known that a mass parameter is required and a soft brst symmetry breaking associated with this parameter appears , see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "this parameter is known as gribov parameter @xmath27 , and it is fixed through minimization of the quantum action , @xmath28 , the so called gap equation .",
    "the action that describes the improved theory ( free of infinitesimal ambiguities ) is known as gribov - zwanziger action @xcite and has a more refined version @xcite by taking into account a few dimension two operators and their condensation effects .",
    "it is clear that the field @xmath29 has the same degrees of freedom that a soldering form in spacetime manifold ( the vierbein ) .",
    "however , the field @xmath29 carries uv dimension 1 while the vierbein is dimensionless .",
    "the presence of a mass scale is then very important to identify the field @xmath29 with an effective soldering form .",
    "we will show in the next sections that the gribov parameter is a very good candidate for this purpose .",
    "the next step is to perform the rescalings @xmath30 at the action eq .  , achieving @xmath31\\;,\\label{ym3}\\ ] ] where , and the covariant derivative is now .",
    "the transition from the action to a gravity action is performed by studying the running behavior of the quantity @xmath32 .",
    "it is expected @xcite that this quantity vanishes for a specific energy scale .",
    "this property induces an inn - wigner contraction @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "however , since the action is not invariant under @xmath34 gauge transformations , the theory actually suffers a symmetry breaking to the stability group @xmath15 .",
    "the broken theory is ready to be rewritten as a gravity theory .",
    "the map ( see @xcite ) is a simple identification of the gauge fields with geometric effective entities according to @xmath35 and @xmath36 . where the indices @xmath37 belong to the tangent space of the effective deformed spacetime , @xmath38 is the spin connection 1-form and @xmath39 the vierbein 1-form .",

    "the symbol @xmath46 stands for the hodge dual operator in @xmath47 ( the deformed spacetime ) .",

    "we will use @xmath51 since we are building a yang - mills for the @xmath0 group . in a future",
    "we will employ this value , but , for now , we continue using @xmath52 in general .    at 1-loop",

    "we demonstrate why this choice is actually better than @xmath50 for our purposes .",

    "the energy scale is in units of @xmath67 and the ratio is in units of @xmath77.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we remark that there is a discotinuity ( landau pole ) at @xmath78 .",
    "we interpret this discontinuity as an indication of the transition between the quantum and classical regimes of the model .",
    "for @xmath79 we expect a geometrical regime while for @xmath80 , the theory is at the quantum region .    to estimate the newtonian contant and the renormalization group cut - off we emphasize that we are not assigning any running behaviour to the newtonian constant . accordingly to eq .",
    ", our aim consists in identify the ratio @xmath81 with @xmath41 only after an energy scale is chosen .",
    "so the newtonian constant is fixed as an effective quantity .",
    "it is also important to realize that the deep infrared behaviour of figure  [ fig1 ] , figure  [ fig2 ] and figure  [ fig3 ] do not reproduce the expected behaviour at zero momenta , as known by qcd lattice simulations @xcite . in the deep infrared regime",
    "the coupling parameter @xmath5 goes to a finite value , @xmath82 , an infrared fixed point .",
    "however , this extreme behaviour is not relevant for the purpusoes of the present work .",
    "we first follow the procedure performed in @xcite where the strategy was not to solve the gap equation by fixing @xmath65 and @xmath83 , which is the traditional way , but to fix the newtonian constant and find if this is a consistent solution . nevertheless , for the sake of consistency , we need a coupling constant as small as possible . furthermore , we must have @xmath84 . accordingly",
    ", we possess a certain range to work with , namely , @xmath85 let us take , for instance , @xmath86 in eq .  , which provides @xmath87 , satisfying ineq .  .",
    "one way to obtain the scale @xmath65 is setting the newtonian constant to its experimental value , i.e. , @xmath88 in eq .  , providing @xmath89 this result allows us to estimate the renormalized cosmological constant .",
    "combining eq .  , eq .   and",
    "eq .   we obtain @xmath90 we notice that the cut - off value is just right above the planck scale , given by @xmath91 .",
    "the main goal here is to calculate the best values for @xmath92 and @xmath93 in accordance with ineq .  .",
    "to handle this task we apply three methods , labelled by @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , as follows .",
    "@xmath97**_taylor series method _ * *    let us rewrite eq .   as @xmath98 where @xmath99 for merely simplification",
    "next , we expand the right hand side of eq .   as a taylor series at the critical point @xmath78,@xmath100 , @xmath101 as follows @xmath102 with @xmath103 as stated by ineq .",
    "we investigate the series under two perspectives :    * perspective ( i ) : _ the endpoint extremum _",
    "+ the series expansion of @xmath104 has radius of convergence equal to 1 .",
    "precisely , the alternating series test ensures that the series does not converge at @xmath105 and converges at @xmath106 .",
    "hence , the series is convergent for @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , the endpoint extremum occurs at @xmath106 which happens also to be a global maximum .",
    "a curious fact about that series occurs when we truncate the series expansion at even @xmath108 order : any of these truncations have a maximum at @xmath106 .",
    "again such maximum is a global one and it happens at the endpoint . from eq .",
    ", it is clear that , by fixing a global maximum for @xmath104 , a minimum value for @xmath92 is set .",
    "thus , with @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath87 and @xmath109 , which are both in accordance with the intervals described in ineq .  .",
    "* perspective ( ii ) : _ a bound on the taylor series for @xmath104 _ + at this point , we are looking for a certain bound for the series expansion . hence , and since @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 in this range we solve the ineq .   for several @xmath112 values .",

    ", we could work with the interval @xmath117 , however there is another constraint due to the gribov parameter function @xmath118 , according to eq .",
    "and eq .  .",
    "the square root in @xmath118 only has a real solution if @xmath119 , or equivalently , @xmath120 .",
    "this interval is actually more restrictive than the @xmath63-loop treatment .",
    "therefore , we are satisfied with the value @xmath121 . hence , using @xmath122 in the equation system formed by eq .  , eq .   and eq .  , we get @xmath123 and @xmath124    on the other hand , for the other extreme , we choose @xmath125 and the same equation system ( eqs .  , and ) , we find @xmath126 and @xmath127 the values and match with the first ones that we found using @xmath94 .      a straight and simple manner to simplify the gap equation eq .",

    "the gribov mass parameter in our theory is the central point in the development of the induced gravity discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is responsable to address the deformation of the yang - mills theory in the infrared regime to a geometrical theory of gravity . in this model ,",
    "the gribov parameter and the yang - mills coupling constant combine in order to provide the value of newtonian constant . in the present work we have developed 1 and 2-loops estimates to accomodate reliable values for the prediction of newtonian constant .",
    "moreover , the renormalization group scale could also determined .",
    "furthermore , a discussion about the cosmological constant was performed .",
    "our results show that the experimental value of the newtonian constant is a solution of the theory and that the renormalization group scale always lie around planck scale , a good feature for a quantum gravity model candidate .",
    "we have also improved the estimates in order to attain the best values for these constantes , at 1 and 2-loops .",
    "concerning the cosmological constant problem , our model provides an inherent gravitational cosmological constant .",
    "following @xcite , it would be nice that this constant , added to the qft prediction for the standard model vacuum @xcite would compensate each other and provide a very small value for an observational cosmological constant .",
    "however , although very high , our cosmological constant differs from the qft prediction by a few orders in magnitude .",
    "of course , much has to be investigated .",
    "for instance , since the emergence of gravity relies on the gribov parameter and the soft brst breaking @xcite , the gribov - zwanziger refinement @xcite should also be considered with all the extra mass parameters .",
    "these extra masses should also refine the values we have computed in the present work .",
    "we will present here a brief description on the gribov - zwanziger scenario .",
    "for the details of technicalities and fundamental concepts we refer to @xcite .",
    "quantization of yang - mills theories is a hard work .",
    "initially , the procedure established by faddeev and popov @xcite was well - succeeded in the perturbative regime during the process of quantizing the gauge fields . however , the faddeev - popov method is not accurate at low energies , where the system becomes highly non - perturbative .",
    "in essence , a gauge symmetry survives and is manifest at the infrared region .",
    "this is the so called gribov ambiguities problem .",
    "the way to treat such ambiguities , as proposed by gribov , is to look for a region in the gauge field space without ambiguities and truncate the faddeev - popov path integral to such region .",
    "such a region is called _ fundamental modular region_. however the implementation of such region in the faddeev - popov path integral is a highly nontrivial problem with no solution so far .",
    "nevertheless , the problem can be partially solved by restricting the path integral to the so called gribov region , which is well defined for only a few gauges such as the landau gauge . at the landau gauge",
    ", the gribov region can be defined as @xmath134 with @xmath135 and @xmath136 is the faddeev - popov operator .",
    "following for instance @xcite , the improved gauge fixed faddeev - popov action is given by the gribov - zwanziger action @xmath137 where , @xmath138 .",
    "the non - local term is known as the horizon function and , together with the gap equation , @xmath139 ensures that the path integral is inside the gribov region . in",

    "we can straightforwardly observe that the fermionic fields do not contribute in the quadratic action .",
    "it is worth mentioning that many contributions from condensates @xcite also appear in a refined version of , however , they are not relevant for the purposes of this work .",
    "although we are satisfied with the results obtained in this work , one can argue if another parameter could describe the newtonian constant and the cosmological constant in a better way .",
    "since we are not considering any condensation effect , the other possibility would be @xmath50 rather than @xmath27 .",
    "let us reconsider and rewrite the gap equation taking into account @xmath50 instead of @xmath27 , @xmath149 manipulating eq .   and",
