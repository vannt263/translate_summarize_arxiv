    "the effect of confinement on the phase diagram of fluids is a longstanding problem with a wide interest from the theoretical point of view and a wide area of possible applications such as catalysis , adsorption and filtration .",
    "a large phenomenology on this subject can be found  @xcite .",
    "real porous materials show generally a complex structure made of an interconnected network of pores .",
    "vycor glass and silica gels are relevant examples .",
    "it is important to distinguish between two classes of systems . in hosting media with very high porosity like silica aerogel ( @xmath0 )",
    "it has experimentally been observed that the gas - liquid transition is preserved although the confinement causes a reduction of the critical temperature and a shrinkage of the gas - liquid coexistence curve  @xcite . in mesoporous materials with a porosity in the range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as for instance vycor glass , there are not direct observations of equilibrium phase transitions  @xcite . this last behaviour is predicted by theoretical work performed in the framework of lattice gas models  @xcite .",
    "this type of approach is connected to the more general issue of the effects of quenched disorder on critical phenomena  @xcite . in dilute silica aerogels with high porosity , however",
    ", phase transitions between equilibrium phases can not be theoretically excluded  @xcite although more recent experiments  @xcite and mean field calculations  @xcite questioned the early experimental findings of a gas - liquid transition in @xmath3 in aerogel .    for dilute silica aerogels off lattice liquid state models",
    "have been introduced  @xcite to take into account more in detail the microstructure of the confining systems . in these off lattice models",
    "the disordered porous material is modeled as a system of spheres frozen in a predefined structure .",
    "the quenched matrix approximately accounts for the geometric constraints of the interconnected pore structure of the solid . from both computer simulations  @xcite and integral equation methods  @xcite",
    "it has been found that the phase diagram of these models can show , besides the gas - liquid coexistence ( glc ) , the presence of a second transition .",
    "this transition can be a gas - gas or a liquid - liquid coexistence depending on the liquid - matrix type of interaction .",
    "nonetheless the appearance of this coexistence and its details depend on the way in which the confining random matrix is realized  @xcite .",
    "moreover relevant wetting or drying effects could be present  @xcite",
    ".    therefore while the coexistence of different fluid forms in a simple monatomic fluid confined in silica aerogels is of uttermost interest , its existence is still a controversial result .",
    "the fact that the phase diagram has shown to depend so much on the details of the quenched random matrix has precluded so far more detailed microscopic analysis on these confined fluids and a systematic study of size effects .    from these considerations and a more recent theoretical analysis based on integral equation methods  @xcite",
    "it emerges the importance of realizing by computer simulation an host system which accounts microscopically for the high porosity and the fractal structure of the silica aerogel .",
    "its structure is due to the process of formation of the gel through the random aggregation of the silica particles and it is measured in small angle scattering experiments where a fractal dimension of @xmath4 has been estimated  @xcite .",
    "these microscopic features are not present in any of the previous lattice or off lattice simulated systems , mentioned above .    in order to build up a confining medium with the structure of silica aerogels ,",
    "we have implemented a numerical procedure  @xcite based on the diffusion limited cluster - cluster aggregation ( dlca )  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that the dlca algorithm is able to reproduce the structure factor and the fractal dimension of silica aerogels . in a previous study we calculated with the multicanonical ensemble sampling ( mes )  @xcite the phase diagram of a lennard - jones fluid confined in the matrix generated with the dlca and we found a glc curve  @xcite and no evidence of a second transition except for a possible signature in a shouldering on the liquid side of the coexistence curve of a liquid - liquid coexistence ( llc ) . as it is well known for aerogels",
    "@xcite systems with the same porosity show the same average size of the clusters , the same connectivity , the same behaviour and range of the fractal scale .",
    "we expect therefore that performing simulations with confining media at constant porosity and increasing size that the behaviour of the liquid will be independent from the details of the realization of the matrix apart for the size effects themselves since the liquid is embedded in self similar structures .    in this paper",
    "we report the results obtained by increasing the size of the confining medium at constant porosity with the aim of inquiring about the existence of a llc in the lennard - jones simple fluid possibly hidden in our past study by the small size of the simulated system .",
    "to generate the off lattice matrix in a simulation box of side @xmath5 we introduce a number @xmath6 of spheres of diameter @xmath7 randomly placed and apply periodic boundary conditions . after the application of the dlca algorithm the final configuration of the matrix consists of a percolated cluster of @xmath6 spheres . for our former system , which we will call in the following system i  @xcite , we used @xmath8 and @xmath9 in order to have a volume fraction @xmath10 corresponding to a porosity @xmath11 . for the system simulated in the present work , system",
    "ii , we fix the same @xmath12 and porosity increasing the box length to @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the system consists of @xmath14 spheres .",
    "the average cluster size is @xmath15 independent from the system size .",
    "the particles of the confined fluid interact with a lennard - jones potential with @xmath16 at variance with real systems where the aerogel spheres are much larger than the fluid particles . in the following lennard - jones units will be used . the potential is truncated at @xmath17 .",
    "the interaction between the matrix spheres and the fluid particles is represented by a hard sphere potential with diameter @xmath18 .",
    "the simulation of the phase diagram of the confined fluid is performed by monte carlo in the grand canonical ensemble ( gcmc ) with the algorithm introduced by wilding  @xcite . by varying the chemical potential @xmath19 at constant temperature @xmath20 we follow the behaviour of the density fluctuations and calculate the density distribution functions ( ddf ) @xmath21 . in a two phase region",
    "the ddf develop a double peak structure .",
    "the coexistence point between the two phases is located with the wilding criterion  @xcite by tuning the chemical potential at constant temperature to obtain equal area under the two peaks . in the subcritical region where a large free energy barrier is present between the two phases",
    "the mes  @xcite has been implemented to enhance the sampling of the two coexisting phases .    from the double peaked ddf we can extrapolate the biased sampling function at different chemical potentials and temperatures by means of the histogram reweighting technique  @xcite .",
    "with the bias sampling function the mes can be carried on . in the final step the bias",
    "must be subtracted to recover the real distribution function  @xcite .",
    "to equilibrate system ii @xmath22 monte carlo moves have been generated , while equilibrium properties have been calculated with @xmath23 monte carlo moves .",
    "the system has been investigated in the range of temperatures from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig:1 ] the bimodal ddf of system ii are reported in the thermodynamical range where the mes analysis has been performed .",
    "the low density peaks corresponding to the gas phase show a behaviour very similar to the corresponding quantities in system i therefore the gas branch of the coexistence curve appears as almost independent from the size of the system . on the liquid side coexisting with the gas we observe instead large differences in the structure of the peaks . in system",
    "i they were found to be broad and asymmetric  @xcite .",
    "now in system ii the form of the peaks is symmetric and sharper . to be more precise for temperatures @xmath26",
    "the density fluctuations are of the order of @xmath27 in system i and @xmath28 in system ii in the same range of temperature variation @xmath29 .",
    "to @xmath24 and liquid - liquid coexistence ( long - dashed lines ) in the range of temperatures from @xmath25 to @xmath30 .",
    "ddf with closer peaks correspond to higher temperatures . in the inset @xmath21 of the liquid - gas coexistence in system",
    "i ( solid line ) compared with the liquid - gas ( long - dashed line ) and the liquid - liquid ( dot - dashed line ) distribution functions of system ii at @xmath30.,width=80 ]    [ fig:1 ]    by increasing the chemical potential at values above the liquid - gas coexistence we find in the adsorption isotherms the appearance of a second coexistence in system ii .",
    "the corresponding ddf are also reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] where they show very well defined peaks . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] it is shown how the bimodal @xmath21 in the system i at @xmath30 is modified in system ii with the emerging of new structures . while the low density peak corresponding to the gas phase remains in the same position in system ii , the liquid peak of system i splits in two in the larger simulation box disclosing the presence of a possible llc .",
    "the new bimodal structure is obtained by increasing of @xmath31 the value of the chemical potential from the value at the gas - liquid coexistence .",
    "the size of system i was not enough large to allow the resolution of the different contributions to the density fluctuations in the system in the region of the liquid peak .    from the peak positions of the ddf with the wilding criterion",
    "the coexistence curves of system ii have been determined and reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] where they are compared with the coexistence curves of system i and with the bulk .",
    "[ fig:2 ]    the confinement causes a substantial shrinkage of the gas - liquid coexistence curve and a shift toward lower temperatures and densities of the critical point .",
    "the confinement also does not induce large changes with respect to the gaseous phase of bulk fluid , in fact the gas branch of the gas - liquid coexistence curve in confinement almost coincides with the analogous branch in the bulk . on the liquid side of system ii a new coexistence curve",
    "is now observed between a low density liquid , which we shall call liquid i , and an high density liquid , liquid ii .",
    "we note that the range of extension of the phase diagram of the confined system is not quite affected by the system size .",
    "we checked that our results are independent from the matrix realization by performing simulations with other two different matrices generated with dlca at the same porosity and @xmath32 .    in system",
    "ii , where the glc appears as a well defined curve , it is possible to extrapolate the critical point position with the use of the law of the rectilinear diameter and the scaling law of the density  @xcite . in the inset of fig .  [ fig:2 ]",
    "we show the coexistence diameter @xmath33 .",
    "the best fit to the rectilinear diameter law @xmath34 combined with the scaling law @xmath35 gives the following estimates of the liquid - gas critical parameters : @xmath36 and @xmath37 to be compared with the values for the bulk @xmath38 and @xmath39  @xcite . at variance with experimental results  @xcite",
    "we find a shift of the critical point to a lower density , this is due to the assumption of a pure repulsion between the fluid and the matrix  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath40 compatible with these critical values is in the range @xmath41 to be compared with the universal exponent @xmath42 found in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "this also confirms the experimental finding that the universal behaviour of the gas - liquid transition in the bulk persists also in confinement  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ fig:3 ] we report the snapshots of two coexisting configurations of the fluid at @xmath30 in the region of the second coexistence curve . from the snapshots we can observe that both liquid i and ii are characterised by the presence of a large cluster and a number of smaller clusters with few particles .     in the low density liquid phase ( liquid i ) on the left and in the high density liquid phase ( liquid ii ) on the right .",
    "the gray and the black spheres represent the gel and the liquid particles respectively . ,",
    "width=80 ]    [ fig:3 ]    we calculated the gyration radius @xmath43 of the larger cluster in the two liquid phases in the range of temperature from @xmath44 to @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath43 is defined by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the distance between the particle @xmath47 and the center of mass of the cluster . in liquid",
    "i we have an increase of number of particles in the system upon increasing temperature and a @xmath48 increase in the number of particles corresponds to a @xmath49 increase of the particles in the cluster and to a @xmath50 increase of the gyration radius . in liquid",
    "ii we observe the opposite trend instead , an increase of number of particles is observed upon decreasing temperature . besides a @xmath51 increase in the number of particles corresponds to a @xmath52 increase of the particles in the cluster while @xmath43 grows only for an @xmath53 .    the radial distribution functions ( rdf ) of the fluid in the two liquid phases ( fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) have been also calculated with a canonical mc starting from equilibrated configurations obtained from the gcmc .",
    "[ fig:4 ]    the usual algorithm for obtaining the rdf from simulation consists in normalizing the number of atom pairs in a spherical shell with the uniform distribution of ideal particles in the same shell .",
    "two of the @xmath54 functions obtained with this procedure are reported as an example in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] for the less dense liquid , liquid i , and for the denser liquid , liquid ii . according to previous literature  @xcite when a fluid is confined the corrected rdf can be generated by appropriately normalizing @xmath54 with the _ uniform _ radial distribution function @xmath55 which depends on the geometry of the confining medium and a factor @xmath56 that accounts for the effective volume occupied by the particles : @xmath57 .",
    "the function @xmath55 can be determined with a convolution of the structure factor of the aerogel system and the internal structure factor of the single hard sphere  @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath55 is reported in the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "the factor @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be empirically determined by imposing that @xmath60 goes to @xmath61 for large @xmath62 .",
    "for liquid i the factor @xmath58 decreases and @xmath59 increases with increasing temperature , in the two cases reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 . in the case of liquid ii , in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] are reported @xmath67 and @xmath68 , for which we get approximately the same value @xmath69 , independent from the temperature .",
    "with the use of the dlca algorithm to build a confinig structure with fractal character we have found that the behaviour of the confined fluid confined in a fractal structure does not depend on the matrix realizations and finite size effects can be studied more systematically . by increasing the size of the simulation box",
    "the gas - liquid transition is well characterized , while a second coexistence curve appears on the high density side of the gas - liquid binodal curve .",
    "it is shown that in the low density liquid phase ( liquid i ) the size of the liquid domains increase with increasing temperature and equivalently the effective volume occupied by the particles @xmath59 grows . in the high density liquid phase ( liquid ii ) instead there is no increase of the size of the liquid domains and of the effective volume . in this regime",
    "we have an increase of the local density which is made possible by little rearrangements of the particles .",
    "even if drying effects due to the repulsive interaction between the fluid and the substrate can not be excluded it seems that the high porous open structure of the aerogel network , built in our simulation , allows the formation of an almost homogeneous liquid phase inside the free volume .",
    "the interpretation of fluid adsorption phenomena in aerogels is still controversial . in our simulation",
    "we studied equilibrium phase transitions and we did not consider hysteretic behaviour . in this respect",
    "our treatment is analogous to the integral equation study of krakoviack et al .",
    "@xcite , where a gas - liquid transition ( but not a liquid - liquid one ) is found for a fluid adsorbed in a high porosity aerogel .",
    "calculations performed with mean field density functional theory aimed to study nonequilibrium behavior show instead a different scenario .",
    "the disordered character of the aerogel structure modifies the adsorption - desorption mechanism although at high temperatures there are indications of a gas - liquid transition  @xcite .",
    "we need future experimental and theoretical work to get a more complete understanding of this vaste and important phenomenology of fluid adsoprtion phenomena . in this respect computer simulation with complete finite size scaling analysis",
    "seems to be necessary since we have shown here that finite size effects are quite relevant .",
