    "triplet superconductivity , which is an analogue of superfluidity in @xmath2 was firstly discovered in a heavy - fermion compound @xmath0 more than ten years ago @xcite .",
    "recently , a novel triplet superconductor @xmath3 was found @xcite . in these compounds ,",
    "the triplet pairing can be reliably determined , for example , by knight shift experiments @xcite , however the identification of a symmetry of the order parameter is much more difficult task .",
    "a large number of experimental and theoretical investigations done on @xmath0 and @xmath3 are concerned with different thermodynamic and transport properties , but the precise order parameter symmetry remains still to be worked out yet ( see , for example , @xcite , and original references therein ) .",
    "calculations of the order parameter @xmath4 in@xmath5 and @xmath3 as a function of the momentum direction @xmath6 on the fermi surface is a very complex problem .",
    "some general information about @xmath7 can be obtained from a symmetry of a normal state : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the point group with inversion ; @xmath10 is the time - inversion operator , and @xmath11 is the group of gauge transformation . a superconducting state breaks one or more symmetries . in particular , a transition to the superconducting state implies an appearance of the phase coherence corresponding to breaking of the gauge symmetry . according to landau theory @xcite of second order phase transitions ,",
    "the order parameter is transformed only on irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the normal state .",
    "conventional superconducting states have a total point symmetry of the crystal and belong to the unitary even representation @xmath12 in unconventional superconductors this symmetry is broken .",
    "the parity of a superconductor with inversion symmetry can be specified using the pauli principle .",
    "because for triplet pairing the spin part of the @xmath13 is a symmetric second rank spinor , the orbital part has to belong to the odd representation . in a general case",
    "the triplet paring is described by the order parameter of the form @xmath14 , where the vector @xmath15 and @xmath16 are pauli matrices in the spin space .",
    "a vector @xmath17 in spin space is frequently referred to as an order parameter or a gap vector of the triplet superconductor .",
    "this vector defines the axis along which the cooper pairs have zero spin projection .",
    "if @xmath18 is complex , the spin components of the order parameter spontaneously break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "symmetry considerations reserves for the order parameter considerable freedom in the selection of irreducible representation and its basis functions .",
    "therefore in many papers ( see , for example , @xcite ) authors consider different models ( so - called scenarios ) of superconductivity in @xmath0 and @xmath19 which are based on possible representations of crystallographic point groups .",
    "the subsequent comparison of theoretical results with experimental data makes it possible to conclude on the symmetry of the order parameter .    in real crystalline superconductors",
    "there is no classification of cooper pairing by angular momentum ( @xmath20-wave , @xmath21-wave , @xmath22-wave , @xmath23-wave pairing , etc . ) .",
    "however these terms are often used for unconventional superconductors meaning that the point symmetry of the order parameter is the same as one for the corresponding representation of @xmath24 symmetry group of isotropic conductor . in this",
    "terminology conventional superconductors can be referred to as @xmath20-wave .",
    "for example , the  @xmath21-wave ",
    "pairing corresponds to the odd two - dimensional representation @xmath25 of @xmath26 point group or @xmath27 representation of @xmath28 point group .",
    "the order parameter for these representations has the same symmetry , as for the superconducting state with angular momentum @xmath29 of cooper pairs in an isotropic conductor .",
    "if the symmetry of @xmath13 can not be formally related to any irreducible representation of @xmath24 group , these states are usually referred to as hybrid states .",
    "apparently , in crystalline triplet superconductors the order parameter has more complex dependence on @xmath6 in comparison with well known @xmath21-wave order parameter for superfluid phases of @xmath30 the heavy - fermion superconductor @xmath0 belongs to the hexagonal crystallographic point group @xmath31 and it is most likely that the pairing state belongs to @xmath32 (  @xmath33wave  state ) representation .",
    "a layered perovskite material @xmath3 belongs to the tetragonal crystallographic point group @xmath34 .",
    "initially the simplest ",
    "@xmath21-wave  model based on @xmath27 representation was proposed for the superconducting state in this compound @xcite .",
    "however this model was inconsistent with available experimental data , and later @xcite other  @xmath23-wave  models of pairing state were proposed .",
    "theoretical studies of specific heat , thermal conductivity , ultrasound absorption for different models of triplet superconductivity show considerable quantitative differences between calculated dependences@xcite .",
    "the josephson effect is much more sensitive to dependence of @xmath13 on the momentum direction on the fermi surface .",
    "one of the possibilities to form a josephson junction is to create a point contact between two massive superconductors .",
    "a microscopic theory of the stationary josephson effect in ballistic point contacts between conventional superconductors was developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "later this theory was generalized for a pinhole model in @xmath35 @xcite and for point contacts between  @xmath22-wave  high-@xmath36 superconductors @xcite .",
    "it was shown that current - phase dependences for the josephson current in such systems are quite different from those of conventional superconductors , and states with a spontaneous phase difference become possible .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations of this effect in novel triplet superconductors seem to be interesting and enable one to distinguish among different candidates for the superconducting state .",
    "in ref.@xcite the authors study the interface andreev bound states and their influence on the josephson current between clean  @xmath23-wave ",
    "superconductors both self - consistently ( numerically ) and non - self - consistently ( analytically ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the critical current is presented .",
    "however in that paper there is no detailed analysis of the current - phase dependences for different orientations of the crystals in the superconducting banks .    in this paper",
    "we theoretically investigate the stationary josephson effect in a small ballistic junction between two bulk triplet superconductors with different orientations of the crystallographic axes with respect to the junction normal . in sec.ii",
    "we describe our model of the junction and present the full set of equations . in sec.iii the current density in the junction plane",
    "is analytically calculated for a non - self - consistent model of the order parameter .",
    "in sec.iv the current - phase dependences for most likely models of  @xmath23-wave  superconductivity in @xmath0 and @xmath3 are analyzed for different mutual orientations of the banks .",
    "we end in sec.v with some conclusions .",
    "we consider a model of a ballistic point contact as an orifice with a diameter @xmath22 in an impenetrable for electrons partition between two superconducting half spaces ( fig.1 ) .",
    "we assume that the contact diameter @xmath22 is much larger than the fermi wavelength and use the quasiclassical approach .    in order to calculate the stationary josephson current in point contact we use  transport - like ",
    "equations for @xmath37-integrated green functions @xmath38@xcite@xmath39 + iv_{f}\\widehat{{\\bf k}}\\nabla \\stackrel{\\vee } { g}=0 ,   \\label{quasiclass_eq}\\ ] ] and the normalization condition @xmath40 here @xmath41 are discrete matsubara energies , @xmath42 is the fermi velocity , @xmath6 is a unit vector along the electron velocity , @xmath43 are pauli matrices in a particle - hole space .",
    "the matsubara propagator @xmath44 can be written in the form @xcite : @xmath45 as can be done for an arbitrary nambu matrix .",
    "matrix structure of the off - diagonal self energy @xmath46 in nambu space is @xmath47 below we consider so - called unitary states , for which @xmath48 the gap vector @xmath49 has to be determined from the self - consistency equation : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a potential of pairing interaction ; @xmath52 stands for averaging over directions of an electron momentum on the fermi surface ; @xmath53 is the electron density of states .",
    "solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ quasiclass_eq ] ) , ( [ self - cons_eq ] ) must satisfy the conditions for green functions and vector @xmath54 in the banks of superconductors far from the orifice : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the external phase difference .",
    "( [ quasiclass_eq ] ) and ( [ self - cons_eq ] ) have to be supplemented by the boundary continuity conditions at the contact plane and conditions of reflection at the interface between superconductors .",
    "below we assume that this interface is smooth and electron scattering is negligible .",
    "the solution of eqs . ( [ quasiclass_eq ] ) and ( [ self - cons_eq ] ) allows us to calculate the current density : @xmath57    we consider a simple model of the constant order parameter up to the surface . the pair breaking and the scattering on the partition and in the junction",
    "are ignored .",
    "this model can be rigorously found for the calculations of the current density ( [ j(r ) ] ) in ballistic point contacts between conventional superconductors at zero approximation with small parameter @xmath58 ( @xmath59 is the coherence length ) @xcite . in",
    "anisotropically paired superconductors the order parameter changes at distances of the order of @xmath59 even near a specular surface @xcite .",
    "thus for calculations of the current ( [ j(r ) ] ) in the main approximation on the parameter @xmath58 it is necessary to solve the equation ( [ self - cons_eq ] ) near a surface of the semi - infinite superconductor .",
    "it can be done only numerically and will be the subject of our future investigations . below",
    "we assume that the order parameter does not depend on coordinates and in each half - space equals to its value ( [ d(inf ) ] ) far form the point contact . for this non - self - consistent model",
    "the current - phase dependence of a josephson junction can be calculated analytically .",
    "it makes possible to analyze the main features of current - phase dependences for different scenarios of  @xmath23-wave  superconductivity .",
    "we believe that under this strong assumption our results describe the real situation qualitatively , as it was justified for point contacts between  @xmath22-wave  superconductors @xcite and pinholes in @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in ref.@xcite that for the contact between  @xmath23-wave ",
    "superconductors there is also good qualitative agreement between self - consistent and non - self - consistent solutions ( although , of course , quantitative distinctions , take place ) .    in a ballistic case",
    "the system of 16 equations for functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be decomposed on independent blocks of equations .",
    "the set of equations which enables us to find the green function @xmath62 is @xmath63 where @xmath64 the eqs .",
    "( [ a])-([d ] ) can be solved by integrating over ballistic trajectories of electrons in the  right and left half - spaces .",
    "the general solution satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ g(inf ) ] ) at infinity is @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the time of the flight along the trajectory , @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 by matching the solutions ( [ e]-[h ] ) at the orifice plane @xmath70 , we find constants @xmath71 and @xmath72 index @xmath73 numbers left @xmath74 and right @xmath75 half - spaces .",
    "the function @xmath76 which determines the current density in the contact is    @xmath77 @xmath78 in the formula ( [ g1(0 ) ] ) we have taken into account that for unitary states vectors @xmath79 can be written as @xmath80 where @xmath81 are real vectors .    knowing the function",

    "we consider a rotation @xmath92 only in the right superconductor ( see , fig.1 ) , ( i.e. , @xmath93 ) . the @xmath94-axis in the left half - space we choose along the partition between superconductors ( along @xmath95-axis in fig.1 ) . to illustrate results obtained by computing the formula ( [ jjos ] ) , we plot the current - phase dependence for different below mentioned scenarios of  @xmath23-wave  superconductivity for two different geometries corresponding to different orientations of the crystals to the right and to the left at the interface ( see , fig.1 ) :    \\(i ) the basal @xmath96-plane to the right is rotated about @xmath94-axis by the angle @xmath97 ; @xmath98 .",

    "this model describes the hexagonal analog of spin - triplet @xmath23-wave pairing . for the high - temperature a - phase ( @xmath108 ) the order parameter has an equatorial line node and two longitudinal  line nodes . in the low - temperature b - phase ( @xmath109 ) or the axial state : @xmath110 the longitudinal  line nodes are closed and there is a pair of point nodes .",

    "note that the tangential to the surface current as a function of @xmath129 is not zero when the josephson current ( fig.[fig3 ] ) is zero .",
    "this spontaneous tangential current ( see also in ref.@xcite ) is due to the specific  proximity effect  similar to spontaneous current in contacts between  @xmath22-wave  superconductors @xcite .",

    "we demonstrate that the study of a current - phase dependence of small josephson junction for different crystallographic orientations of banks enables one to judge on the applicability of different models to the triplet superconductors @xmath0 and @xmath1    it is clear that such experiments require very clean superconductors and perfect structures of the junction because of pairbreaking effects of non - magnetic impurities and defects in triplet superconductors .",
