    "<S> a quantum internet , where widely separated quantum devices are coherently connected , is a fundamental vision for local and global quantum information networks and processing . </S>",
    "<S> superconducting quantum devices can now perform sophisticated quantum engineering locally on chip and a detailed method to achieve coherent optical quantum interconnection between distant superconducting devices is a vital , but highly challenging , goal . </S>",
    "<S> we describe a concrete opto - magneto - mechanical system that can interconvert microwave - to - optical quantum information with high fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> in one such node we utilise the magnetic fields generated by the supercurrent of a flux qubit to coherently modulate a mechanical oscillator that is part of a high - q optical cavity to achieve high fidelity microwave - to - optical quantum information exchange . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the transfer between two spatially distant nodes connected by an optical fibre and using currently accessible parameters we predict that the fidelity of transfer could be as high as @xmath0 , even with significant loss .    </S>",
    "<S> ( 10,10 ) ( -3,.4 )    in this report we describe a scheme for a quantum interface between superconducting qubits and optical photons and how to use such interfaces to coherently transfer quantum information optically between spatially remote superconducting qubits . </S>",
    "<S> superconducting quantum devices have recently received a surge of interest and can now perform sophisticated manipulations on qubits and microwave photons locally on chip and are strong candidate for scalable quantum computing @xcite . a coherent quantum transfer between distant superconducting qubits </S>",
    "<S> can thus serve as the underlying architecture for a genuine quantum internet . </S>",
    "<S> the key innovation of our scheme is to employ a magneto - mechanical interaction to provide strong coupling between the quantum state of a superconducting flux qubit ( sq ) and a mechanical resonator ( mr ) , which in turn couples via radiation pressure to an optical resonator ( or ) . by driving the sq we are able to bring it into resonance with the magneto - mechanically coupled mr . by also optically driving the optomechanical system we can modulate the optomechanical coupling strength . using realistic parameters </S>",
    "<S> we show that this configuration can achieve a high fidelity coherent swap between the quantum state of the sq and the or in an individual node .    in fig </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : node ] a detailed design for such an opto - magneto - mechanical system is shown where the optical field in a fabry perot cavity is coupled via a bulk acoustic wave mechanical resonance ( baw ) , which , via a magnetostrictive collar , is coupled magnetically to a sq . by coupling two nodes via an optical fibre </S>",
    "<S> we create a small quantum network and we demonstrate a protocol to transfer the sq quantum states between the nodes with high fidelity .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the quantum interface within a single node for coherent transfer of the superconducting and optically encoded quantum information and following that we analyse coherent quantum transfer between distant superconducting devices . </S>",
    "<S> the interface consists of an or supporting one optical cavity mode and one mechanical vibrational mode and a sq . </S>",
    "<S> the optical cavity mode @xmath1 has a resonance frequency @xmath2 and an intrinsic decay rate @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance frequency and relaxation rate of mechanical motion mode @xmath4 are @xmath5 and @xmath6 . to achieve the magneto - mechanical coupling between the sq and mr we consider that the mr is partly made from a magnetostrictive material like terfenol - d , which , in the presence of a magnetic field expands in our design , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , the magnetostrictive material forms a collar around the baw mechanical mode to allow magnetic field driving of the mechanical motion . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of magnetomechanical coupling has been used for magnetic field sensing and can be quite substantial @xcite . indeed this magneto - mechanical coupling is considerably stronger @xmath7  , than the proposed transfer rates using piezoelectric setups @xmath8  @xcite . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , our design provides excellent mode overlap between the baw mechanical vibrational mode and the expansion / contraction of the magnetostrictive collar . </S>",
    "<S> this should allow even larger magneto mechanical couplings than those previously reported . </S>",
    "<S> the sq can be modeled as a two - level system ( tls ) with the transition frequency @xmath9 driven by a classical microwave field with frequency @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency @xmath9 can be tuned via a bias magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the optomechanical coupling can be described by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the photon and phonon annihilation ( creation ) operators for the optical and mechanical modes respectively and @xmath14 is the optomechanical coupling rate . in the frame rotating at the frequency of driving field ( on resonance with the sq ) , the flux qubit with excited(ground ) states @xmath15 can be modelled as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and the pauli operators are defined as @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the flux qubit is driven by a classical field detuned by @xmath20 from each sq s transition frequency and with rabi frequencies @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic persistent current @xmath22 circulating within each flux qubit induces a magnetic field @xmath23 dependent on the quantum state of each flux qubit @xcite ( see the supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> this magnetic field actuates the motion of the nearby mechanical resonator . </S>",
    "<S> this magneto - mechanical interaction is governed by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the magnetomechanical - qubit coupling rate , @xmath26 is the zero - point width of the mechanical fluctuations with effective mass @xmath27 . at this point </S>",
    "<S> we would like to note that while strong coupling between mechanical motion and a superconducting qubit has been achieved in @xcite , this has not been achieved with a massive mechanical resonator that also allows coupling to light . </S>",

    "<S> the sq is initially prepared in the excited state @xmath52 , and the or in the photonic vacuum state @xmath53 , and the mechanical resonator is in a thermal state at temperature @xmath54  , with @xmath55 , so that the unwanted decoherence induced by a large mechanical excitation is greatly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the optical field , mechanical mode and flux qubit interact resonantly and the resulting three - body rabi oscillation is shown in fig .  [ fig : onenode ] . </S>",

    "<S> our concrete design uses currently accessible parameters for each of the components and can achieve a high fidelity for microwave - to - optical conversion in a single node . </S>",
