    "in recent years , much attention has been paid to coupled - cavity arrays ( ccas ) @xcite due to their extremely rich physics as well as their wide potential applications to work as an effective platform to realize quantum information processing and to carry out photonics tasks . for instance , ccas stand out as an attractive controllable test bed for strongly correlated many - body models and quantum simulators of many - body physics @xcite .",
    "transport properties of photons and various excitations in ccas embedded with natural or artificial atoms are also receiving considerable interest @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated that ccas with a cyclic three - level system or a single atom open the possibility to quantum routing of single photons @xcite .",
    "ccas typically consist of an arrangement of low - loss cavities with nearest - neighbor coupling allowing photon hopping between neighboring cavities .",
    "an appealing feature of ccas is the available high control of each single cavity in terms of performable measurements , quantum - state engineering , and dynamical parameter tuning .",
    "this feature can be used to realize local addressing in quantum information processing .",
    "progress in the fabrication techniques make ccas experimentally accessible @xcite .",
    "although quantum entanglement is an essential resource in quantum information processing , propagation of spatially entangled photons in ccas without natural or artificial atoms has not been studied extensively heretofore .",
    "a natural question is how quantum entanglement of initial input photons affects photonic transport properties in ccas .    in this paper , we study transport properties of two initially entangled photons which are injected into two nearest - neighbor coupling cavities in a one - dimensional cca . we show that photonic transport dynamics in the two - photon cca exhibits the entanglement - enhanced two - photon delocalization ( tpd ) phenomenon .",
    "we investigate tpd dynamics by introducing the concept of the tpd degree when two nearest - neighbor coupling cavities are initially in two - photon entangled state @xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrate that the cca can realize the localization - to - delocalization transition for two entangled photons .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec",
    "ii , we present our physical model and its solution . in sec iii ,",
    "we analyze photonic transport properties and tpd in the two - photon cca , and show the entanglement - enhanced tpd and the localization - to - delocalization transition for two entangled photons .",
    "finally , we shall conclude our paper with discussions and remarks in the last section .",
    "let us consider a finite - length cca in which nearest - neighbor cavities are coupled together so as to allow for photon hopping .",

( 3 ) , one can obtain exact solution of the cca in the heisenberg representation with the following form @xmath11 where the explicit form of the green s function is given by @xmath12    in the following section , we shall use above exact solution to investigate quantum dynamics of photonic transport and tpd in the two - photon cca .",
    "the quantum mechanical properties of light are observed when correlations between the propagating photons are considered . in this section , we study photonic transport properties and quantum dynamics of two - photon delocalization in the two - photon cca when two entangled photons are injected into the cca by investigating the evolution of the photon - number correlation function @xmath13 which represents the probability of detecting a two - photon coincidence across cavity @xmath14 and cavity @xmath15 .",
    "the probability to detect both photons at the same cavity @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 .",
    "we consider such a situation in which the two photons are initially in @xmath17-th cavity and @xmath18-th cavity with the following two - photon noon - type states @xmath19 where for the simplicity , we take @xmath20 throughout the paper .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two photons in the two - photon entangled states ( 9 ) are in the same cavity , i.e. , cavity @xmath17 or cavity @xmath18 .",
    "the other cavities in the cca are in vacuum state . hence , the two - photon entangled states given by eq .",

    "the amount of entanglement of the two - photon states in eq.(9 ) can be measured by concurrence @xcite with the following expression @xmath21 obviously , the concurrence vanishes when @xmath22 , and @xmath23 while the concurrence reaches the maximum value @xmath24 when @xmath25 .",

    "the degree of the tpd can be defined in terms of the sum of probability @xmath37 of detecting photons in every cavity @xmath38 which represents the probability of the two photons being not at the same cavity in the cca simultaneously .",
    "especially , when @xmath39 , the two photons are in the complete tpd state in which the two photons are completely in different cavities . in this case , it is impossible that the two photons are in the same cavity . hence , the two photons in the tpd state tend to stay at different cavities . in this sense",
