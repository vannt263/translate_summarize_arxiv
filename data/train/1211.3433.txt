    "absorption lines in quasar ( qso ) spectra provide a unique tool for probing the gas and dust content of foreground galaxies and of intergalactic medium at almost any redshift . since the works of @xcite and @xcite these features are considered to be linked to large gaseous haloes around galaxies extending up to @xmath3kpc ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "despite a number of studies aimed at connecting metal absorption systems ( in particular  and ) with galaxy properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the origin of the absorbing gas is still unclear .",
    "however , in the last decades , it is progressively emerging a scenario in which the stronger absorption lines ( rest frame equivalent width @xmath4 ) are linked to winds driven by the star formation activity , while the weaker one are associated with inflows of gas onto the host galaxies .",
    "for instance , @xcite , stacking sdss images of 2800   absorbers with @xmath5 , show that the stronger absorption systems reside preferentially in blue star  forming galaxies , while the weaker ones in red passive galaxies .",
    "this result was confirmed by @xcite in a sample of 8500   absorption systems present in the sdss qso spectra .",
    "they discovered a strong correlation between the  of the absorbers and the luminosity of the associated [ ] lines , considered as a tracer of the star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies .",
    "@xcite investigated the evolution of the number density of @xmath6  strong absorption systems and found rough correspondence with the evolution of the star formation rate at redshifts between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , suggesting a link between the two phenomena .",
    "recently @xcite reported clear evidence that ultrastrong   absorbers ( @xmath9 ) reside in galaxies with very high sfrs .",
    "in addition to that , spectroscopic observations of highly star forming galaxies reveals the presence of blueshifted  absorption features , further supporting the outflowing winds scenario @xcite .",
    "the existence of a link between galaxy luminosity / halo mass and strength of absorption features , expected in the infalling scenario , is still debated . @xcite and @xcite found that the  and the extent of  and  absorption systems are related to host galaxy luminosity . more directly , @xcite searched for absorption systems in a sample of 94 galaxies at redshifts between @xmath10 and @xmath11 within @xmath12kpc from a qso sightline .",
    "the  of the systems found ( the great majority of which have @xmath13 ) scales with the stellar mass and only little with the star formation rate of the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "these results are interpreted considering that  absorption systems arise from infalling clouds to fuel star formation .",
    "@xcite directly compared the relative  halo gas and host galaxy kinematics for 13 l@xmath14 galaxies at @xmath15 .",
    "they found that these galaxies have low sfrs and a kinematically quiescent interstellar medium containing no outflowing gas . given that these galaxies live in isolated environment , they suggest a scenario in which the cool gas halo was infalling and providing a gas reservoir that could maintain the low levels of star formation within the host galaxies .",
    "@xcite , in a sample of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) with redshifts @xmath16 , found a low covering factor ( @xmath17 ) for absorber with @xmath18  and a lack of correlation between  and impact parameter or r  band absolute magnitude of the galaxies .",
    "they suggested that this is due or to the rich environment of these objects that makes their haloes too hot to maintain cool gas , or to the low rates of star formation that are not intense enough to fill their haloes with  clouds .",
    "cross correlating  absorption systems and the properties of lrgs @xcite found at redshift @xmath19 an anti  correlation between the halo mass and the  of absorbers ( most of which have @xmath4 ) , which suggests that the  absorption systems are not virialised within the haloes .",
    "these results were further confirmed in larger sample by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite detect inflow of gas into isolated star  forming galaxies at @xmath19 .",
    "in contrast to the large attention given to absorptions detected around normal galaxies , only few studies have been focused on the properties of the gaseous halo of galaxies hosting a qso in their centre .",
    "the observation of projected qso pairs allows to probe the properties of the foreground qso ( , @xmath20 ) , through the study of absorption features imprinted on the background qso spectra ( , @xmath21 ) .",
    "the standard model on the origin of qso high luminosity requires an intense gas accretion on a supermassive black hole that dramatically increases its activity .",
    "feasible mechanisms responsible for the gas infall are instabilities caused by strong gravitational interactions and galaxy mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the close ( few hundreds kiloparsecs ) environment of qsos is expected to be populated by tidal debris , streams , and diffuse cool gas clouds , as commonly observed in interacting galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given their low surface brightness , most of the properties of these features could be investigated almost exclusively in absorption , especially at high redshift .",
    "some studies have been performed to analyse the distribution of neutral hydrogen around qsos .",
    "for instance @xcite , starting from a sample of 149 projected qso pairs ( projected distance : @xmath22kpc@xmath23mpc ; redshift : @xmath24 ) , found that the probability to have an absorber with @xmath25@xmath26 coincident within 200kpc with a  is high ( @xmath27 ) , and that the distribution of these absorbers is highly anisotropic ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the study of projected qso pairs gives also the possibility to investigate the so  called _ transverse proximity effect _",
    ": i.e. , the expected decrease of absorption systems in the ly@xmath28 forest of a  due to the ionising flux of a . intriguingly the many attempts to measure this effect , with perhaps one exception @xcite , have led to only marginal or no detection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of a transverse proximity effect for heavier elements is still unclear .",
    "for instance it was observed for heii by @xcite , but not for  @xcite or for   @xcite .    up to now , only a few metal absorption systems associated or near to a qso have been serendipitously discovered ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the limited statistics is due to the little number of known close projected qso pairs .",
    "even the large spectroscopic qso catalogue of the sloan digital sky survey , made of more than 100000 objects  @xcite , contains only 22 qso pairs with separation less than  @xmath29 .",
    "one should recall that the fiber collisions prevents the spectroscopic observations of two sources with separations below  @xmath30 in a single plate .",
    "@xcite studied the distribution of metal absorption features ( in most case ) present in the spectra of 170 close ( @xmath31 ) projected qso pairs with separations @xmath3kpc@xmath32mpc in order to investigate their mpc scale clustering properties around qsos and other absorbers .",
    "they found 16 absorbers within @xmath33  km / s from the , all with @xmath34kpc , that cluster with an approximately isotropic distribution , with a hint of an excess for systems with redshift @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite select from the sample of projected qso systems of @xcite 4 the pairs with @xmath36kpc and @xmath37 . in all these systems",
    "they detect  absorption lines clearly associated to  ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) . despite the small sample size , they speculate that the absence of corresponding absorption lines in the spectra of  involve a non isotropic distribution of the absorbing gas . on the basis of these data @xcite proposed that the gas in the outer region of qsos ( i.e. , at radius larger than @xmath38kpc ) is distributed in the same way of @xmath39 galaxies , but their thermal and ionisation structure is highly influenced by the central black hole emission .    in this paper",
    "we search for  and  absorption features in a sample of 13 projected pairs .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the physical properties and the spatial distribution of the cool gas associated to the halo of qsos .",
    "it is worth noting that the considered ions have very different ionisation energies , probing different gas conditions .",
    "the properties of the detected features are compared with those found in _",
    "normal _ galaxies ( i.e. , galaxies not hosting a qso ) in order to investigate the effects of the central black hole emission on the cool gas .",
    "we present our sample in ",

    "we investigate the properties of the detected absorption systems . in ",

    "we conclude and summarise in ",
    "[ sec:6 ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we consider a concordance cosmology with h@xmath40km / s / mpc , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "we searched in the @xcite quasar catalogue for projected pairs that match the following requirements : ( i ) the angular separation is @xmath43 that , at the redshifts considered in our sample ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) , allows us to explore the outer regions of a typical galaxy halo ( i.e. , from 60  to  120kpc ) ; ( ii ) the redshifts of fore and back  ground qsos combine so that the  and  emissions of the  fall within the wavelength range observed with fors2 grism  1400v or grism  1200r , avoiding important sky features or narrow emission lines in the spectrum of the ; ( iii ) targets have declination @xmath45 , so that they are visible from the paranal site ; and finally ( iv ) the qso@xmath46 is brighter than m@xmath47 in order to collect spectra with signal  to  noise @xmath48 .",
    "the resulting sample consists of 19 close pairs , 13 of which were observed with fors2 at vlt .    in table  [ tab:1 ] and in figure  [ fig:1 ] we present the general properties of the 13  observed pairs .",
    "these are radio quiet qsos , with an average angular separation of 11.4@xmath49 that corresponds to an average projected distance of @xmath50kpc . in our sample",
    "we do not take into account the presence of absorption _ a priori _ , thus it seems suitable to estimate the unbiased frequency of absorption systems ."
