    "the experimental generation of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) with ultracold dilute atomic vapors @xcite has turned out to be of exceptional importance for physics .",
    "the formation of a condensate occurs when the temperature is low enough and most of the atoms occupy the ground state of the system .",
    "this process is visible both in momentum and in real space due to the spatial inhomogeneities exhibited by the order parameter on a macroscopic scale because of the trapping potentials .",
    "the properties of the ground state of trapped becs are well known . in the mean field",
    "limit simple analytical expressions are available in the thomas - fermi approximation @xcite and beyond @xcite . these approximations and direct numerical simulations",
    "describe accurately the properties of the experimentally found ground states @xcite .",
    "nonlinear interactions between atoms in a bose - einstein condensate are dominated by the two - body collisions that can be controlled by the so - called feschbach resonance ( fr ) management @xcite .",
    "the control in time of the scattering length has been used to generate bright solitons @xcite and induce collapse @xcite and has been the basis for theoretical proposals to obtain different types of nonlinear waves @xcite .",
    "moreover , interactions can be made spatially dependent by acting on either the spatial dependence of the magnetic field or the laser intensity ( in the case of optical control of frs @xcite ) which act on the feschbach resonances .",
    "this possibility has motivated many theoretical studies on the behavior of solitons in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) with spatially inhomogeneous interactions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe a novel nonlinear phenomenon related to the ground state of a bec in the mean field limit when the interactions are spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "we will show that when the scattering length is non - negative and vanishes on a certain spatial region , a striking localization phenomenon of the atom density occurs at the regions where the interactions vanish . by tuning appropriately the control (",
    "magnetic or optical ) fields this phenomenon can be used to design regions with large particle densities and prescribed geometries . another interesting phenomenon to be studied in this letter",
    "is the nonlinear limitation of tunneling of atoms to the regions in which the interactions are stronger and the fact that the chemical potential exhibits a cutoff value .",
    "although it is reasonable to think that a bec will avoid regions of large repulsive interactions and prefer to remain in regions with smaller interactions , the localization phenomenon to be described in this paper here goes beyond what one would naively expect .",
    "in this paper we will consider physical systems ruled by the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xmath0 in @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a real parameter and @xmath3 are non - negative real functions .",

    "the only relevant property is the positivity , thus we will consider positive solutions of @xmath11 where @xmath4 satisfies",
    ".    from the physical point of view eq .",
    "( [ eq : rd ] ) is a model of different physical systems .",
    "however , as stated in the introduction , in this paper we will focus mainly on its applicability to the description of the ground state of a trapped bose - einstein condensate with spatially inhomogeneous interactions in the mean field limit where physically it is both posible to control the interactions and achieve large values for the coefficient @xmath12 .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ gs ] ) is written in nondimensional units it is easy to connect this problem with the realistic quantum problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) , considering that the coordinates @xmath13 and time @xmath14 are measured in units of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , while the energies and frequencies are measured in units of @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively , @xmath18 being a characteristic frequency of the potential . finally , @xmath19 is proportional to the local value of the s - wave scattering length @xmath20 and the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "another relevant physical quantity , the number of particles , is directly related to the @xmath22 norm of the solution through @xmath23    in this paper we will study properties of the positive solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rd ] ) ( ground state ) when the interactions vanish on a certain set of points which we will denote as @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 through this paper we will assume that @xmath24 is composed by a finite number of closed connected components @xmath26 @xmath27 which are disjoint @xmath28 if @xmath29 and it is assumed that each component @xmath30 is regular enough and that @xmath31 is connected for @xmath32      the thomas - fermi approximation is used extensively in the field of bose - einstein condensation to describe the solutions in the situation in which the nonlinear term is  large \" and proceeds by neglecting the kinetic energy or equivalently the term proportional to @xmath33 in eq .",

    "it is remarkable that , when the interactions are spatially inhomogeneous a new feature appears , which is that the amplitude of the thomas - fermi solution diverges on the set @xmath24 .",
    "although it is obvious , that in the vicinity of @xmath24 the thomas - fermi approximation is not correct , this divergence is the first indication of an interesting nonlinear phenomenon with relevant physical implications whose study is the purpouse of this paper : _ the tendency of positive solutions of eq .",

    "it is interesting to point out that there is a cutoff value for the eigenvalue , @xmath50 beyond which stationary solutions do not exist .",
    "its explicit value can be obtained from the condition of maximum slope at @xmath51 which leads to @xmath52 $ ] . in that limit the @xmath22-norm",
    "( number of particles in the condensate ) diverges , since the amplitude in the outer region @xmath53 .",

    "[ prima ] support our conjecture based on the thomas - fermi solution , i.e. the existence of a strong localization of the solution in the region where the interactions vanish .",
    "physically it is also remarkable that the atom density in the inner part of the domain , i.e. the region where there are nonlinear interactions , remains almost constant independently on the number of particles in the condensate once a certain critical density is achieved .",
    "this region is a nonlinear analogue of the classically forbidden region in ordinary potentials and is energetically less favourable due to the extra repulsive energy provided by the nonlinear interactions .",
    "however , the tunneling of atoms in this region is essentially limited to a constant value , _ independently of the number of atoms _ , which differs essentially from ordinary tunneling .",
    "the supression of tunneling strongly depends on the value of the scattering length in the outer region , that we will take to be nonzero in what follows .",
    "if instead we set @xmath55 when @xmath56 and study the dependence of the ratio between the maximum atom density and the atom density at @xmath57 ( which is a measure of the amplitude of the tunneling ) , we find a strong dependence on this parameter as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ nueva](a ) .",
    "this effect is also seen in the atom density profiles when comparing the cases with @xmath58 [ fig . [ nueva](b ) ] and @xmath59 [ fig .",
    "[ nueva](c ) ] for @xmath60 .",
    "larger values of @xmath61 lead to a stronger effect .",
    "thus we have shown a simple example which already presents the main features of the nonlinear phenomena to be studied with more detail in this paper : the localization of the ground state in the regions where the interactions vanish , the supression of tunneling induced by the presence of inhomogeneous interactions and the limited range of variation for the eigenvalue @xmath62 ( chemical potential ) .",
    "related phenomena have been described in the mathematical analysis of similar logistic equations @xcite in bounded domains @xcite .",
    "however to consider situations of real physical interest we must move to unbounded domains where the analysis is much more complicated and goes beyond our particular simple example and previous theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "in this section we will consider more realistic situations corresponding to problems posed on unbounded domains and strongly confining potentials satisfying the condition . in the examples to be presented in this section we will use harmonic potentials",
    "@xmath63 which arise naturally in the modelling of magnetic trapping potentials for ultracold atoms .    to study the localization phenomenon we have computed numerically the ground state solutions of equations of the form using a standard steepest descent algorithm on the energy functional complemented with a projection over the set of solutions of given @xmath22-norm @xcite",

    "( [ gs ] ) in one - dimensional scenarios ( @xmath64 ) , and take the potential to be of the form @xmath65 . because of the possibilities for optical control of nonlinearities which are posible in bec systems we will choose the nonlinear coefficient to be of the form @xmath66 for different values of @xmath67 .",
    "these choices will allow us to study different degrees of localization of the interactions starting from the case of no localization .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",

    "first , in fig .",
    "[ segunda](a ) we observe how the maximum density ( @xmath68 ) increases drastically for spatially decaying nonlinearities ( blue and red curves ) as a function of the effective number of particles in the quasi - one dimensional condensate @xmath61 .",
    "this amplitude growth is due to a strong localization effect near the region where @xmath12 vanishes as it is seen in fig .",
    "[ segunda](c , d ) .",
    "in contrast , the condensate density for spatially homogeneous interactions grows slowly according to the thomas - fermi prediction @xmath69 . when the number of particles is small , the size of the atomic cloud is smaller than the localization region of @xmath12 . for larger values of @xmath61",
    "the ground state extends beyond the localization region of @xmath12 and the atom density becomes more and more localized near its edge .",
    "this effect is more clear for larger @xmath61 and is accompanied by a saturation in the amplitude growth in the region where @xmath12 is far from zero [ fig . [",
    "segunda](d ) ] .",
    "in the case of spatially homogeneous interactions the width grows according to the law @xmath70 [ fig . [ segunda](b ) ] . when interactions are spatially dependent and due to the localization of the amplitude close to the zero of @xmath12 the width growth saturates for large values of @xmath61 to a value depending on the size of @xmath12 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that although the nonlinearity does not vanish strictly anywhere there is an effect similar to the existence of the cutoff discussed in the previous example , the number of particles increasing enormously for increasing values of @xmath62 , as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ xx ]    these effects are even more clear when the nonlinearity decays to zero faster and is exactly zero on a certain region .",
    "for instance , taking a nonlinear coefficient given by @xmath71 ( i.e. an inverted parabola with maximum amplitude @xmath72 at @xmath57 and zero values for @xmath73 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ tertia ] , we see that the maximum densities are even higher than for @xmath74 . in this case , in comparison with our first simple example , we can see an even stronger localization since the existence of the potential makes energetically more favourable the localization close to the point where the interactions vanish .",
    "in this case we also observe the existence of a cutoff in the values of the eigenvalue @xmath62 ( chemical potential ) close to a certain value @xmath50 .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ tertia2 ] .    as a final example , in fig .",
