    "splines are widely used in image processing due to their simple mathematical structure , in particular , linearity and low complexity in computation .",
    "interpolation with these splines , called spline interpolation , provides smoothness , that is , the interpolated function can be continuous and several times differentiable . by these advantages ,",
    "polynomial splines are very popular in image processing such as curve fitting @xcite , image interpolation ( zooming ) @xcite , rotation @xcite , compression @xcite , and super resolution @xcite .",
    "theoretically , spline interpolation provides perfect fitting for given sampled data when the original analog signal is in the spline space @xcite .",
    "this ideal spline interpolant is however obtained by filtering the whole sampled data .",
    "this leads to _ non - causality _ of the interpolation process .",
    "although this non - causality is not a restriction for image processing , spline interpolation can not be used for real - time processing such as instrumentation or audio / speech processing . when spline interpolation is used in ad ( analog - to - digital ) and da ( digital - to - analog ) converters @xcite , and when it is used in a feedback loop",
    ", the reconstruction delay degrades the stability and the performance of the system . in this case",
    ", the real - time processing is crucial .    for this non - causality problem ,",
    "various approximation methods have been proposed to obtain a _ causal _ system which approximates the ideal ( non - causal ) spline interpolation , by the constrained least square design @xcite , the kaiser window method @xcite , and the maximum order minimum support ( moms ) function method @xcite .",
    "these methods are based on minimizing the squared approximation error in the time domain .",
    "this optimization can be generalized to @xmath2 optimization @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 optimization minimizes the @xmath3 norm of the impulse response .",
    "hence it works basically for this particular signal only , and its performance against other input signals is not a priori guaranteed . in other words , it can happen that the reconstruction error will be significantly large for other unknown signals .",
    "in real systems , input signals are unknown , or only partially known ( e.g. , the input signals contain their frequencies mostly within 1.5 rad / sec ) , and hence there are _ uncertainty _ in input signals . to model such uncertainty ,",
    "we assume a certain class of input function spaces , and consider a neighborhood ( e.g. , a unit ball ) of such a function space .",
    "we then consider that signal uncertainty as nominal signal plus unknown signals that belongs to such a ball . by controlling the induced norm of a pertinent operator",
    ", one can attenuate the response against such uncertainty , and this provides a contrasting viewpoint of robustness , not in a probabilistic sense , but in a deterministic treatment .",
    "this has the advantage of minimizing the _ worst - case _ errors in contrast to probabilist models .",
    "robustness against such uncertainty is achieved by _",
    "@xmath0 optimization _ @xcite which aims at minimizing or maintaining the error level below a certain prescribed performance level against all input signals , and possess much higher robustness against lack of a priori knowledge about input signals to be processed .",
    "@xmath0 optimization was first proposed and developed in control theory @xcite , and then applied to signal processing @xcite . since the @xmath0 norm gives the @xmath3-induced norm or the maximum energy gain , minimizing the @xmath0 norm of the error system gives the optimality for the worst case .",
    "this property leads to robustness of the system against uncertainty of the input signal .",
    "that is , the @xmath0 design guarantees an error level @xmath4 for all @xmath3 signals .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 method can naturally take a frequency weight in the design .",
    "the weight can control the shape of the frequency response of the error system , according to given knowledge on the frequency characteristic of the input signals .",
    "from the computation viewpoint , the @xmath0 optimization can be executed numerically via the state - space formulation , and is easily done by standard softwares , as matlab .",
    "we propose a new approximation method for causal spline interpolation by @xmath0 optimization .",
    "the design is formulated as obtaining the @xmath0-sub - optimal stable inverse filter of a system with unstable zeros . in particular , for the cubic spline ( 3rd order spline ) , the @xmath0 optimal filter can be obtained in a closed form . for a spline with arbitrary order ,",
    "the @xmath0 sub - optimal iir ( infinite impulse response ) filter is easily obtained by numerical computation .",
    "moreover , by confining the desired sub - optimal filter to be fir ( finite impulse response ) , the optimization is reducible to an lmi ( linear matrix inequality ) , which can be effectively solved by , for example , standard matlab routines .",
    "a design example is presented to show effectiveness of our method .",

    "<S> in this paper , we give a causal solution to the problem of spline interpolation using @xmath0 optimal approximation . </S>",
    "<S> generally speaking , spline interpolation requires filtering the whole sampled data , the past and the future , to reconstruct the inter - sample values . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to non - causality of the filter , and this becomes a critical issue for real - time applications . </S>",
    "<S> our objective here is to derive a causal system which approximates spline interpolation by @xmath0 optimization for the filter . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of @xmath0 optimization is that it can address uncertainty in the input signals to be interpolated in design , and hence the optimized system has robustness property against signal uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> we give a closed - form solution to the @xmath1 optimization in the case of the cubic splines . for higher - order splines , </S>",
    "<S> the optimal filter can be effectively solved by a numerical computation . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the optimal fir ( finite impulse response ) filter can be designed by an lmi ( linear matrix inequality ) , which can also be effectively solved numerically . </S>",
    "<S> a design example is presented to illustrate the result . </S>"
