    "the decay of the ground state of quantum field theory , the vacuum , via the creation of real particles due to disturbances of the vacuum caused by time dependent external conditions demonstrates the highly non - trivial nature of the quantum vacuum .    the dynamical or non - stationary casimir effect ( see @xcite and references therein ) represents one particular example out of the variety of fascinating phenomena occurring in the sector of quantum field theory under the influence of external conditions @xcite .",
    "in this scenario the quantum vacuum responds to time - varying boundaries like moving mirrors by its decay via the creation of particles out of virtual quantum fluctuations . for calculations involving a single mirror",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .    in a",
    "dynamical ( one - dimensional ) cavity with one mirror residing at a fixed position , say @xmath0 , and a second mirror changing its position @xmath1 according to a given dynamics @xmath2 the source of particle creation is twofold .",
    "the so - called squeezing of the vacuum @xcite due to the dynamical change of the quantization volume ( the size of the cavity ) yields time dependent eigenfrequencies of the field modes .",
    "furthermore , boundary conditions imposed on the field inside the cavity at the positions of the mirrors cause a time dependent coupling between all field modes .",
    "this is denoted as the acceleration effect @xcite .",
    "being proportional to the velocity @xmath3 of the boundary motion this coupling of the time evolution of all field modes inside a dynamical cavity distinguishes the vacuum decay in the dynamical casimir effect from other quantum vacuum effects like particle creation in an expanding universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) where the time dependence of eigenfrequencies is the only source of particle creation .",
    "this acceleration effect makes it , apart from exceptional cases , impossible to find analytical solutions to the field equations .",
    "a particular example for which analytical solutions are known and the particle production can be described by closed form expressions is the scenario of uniformly moving boundaries @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moore @xcite found that the mode functions @xmath4 inside a one - dimensional dynamical cavity @xmath5 satisfying both , the wave equation @xmath6\\phi_k(t , x)=0 $ ] with @xmath7 and the non - stationary dirichlet boundary condition @xmath8=0 $ ] , can be written ( up to a normalization ) as @xmath9 provided that @xmath10 satisfies the equation @xmath11-r[t - l(t)]=2 $ ] .",
    "this equation can be solved and @xmath10 evaluated exactly , for instance , in the scenario in which @xmath12 undergoes a uniform motion .",
    "another particularly interesting scenario are so - called vibrating cavities @xcite .",
    "thereby the field is confined between two parallel walls whose distance @xmath12 changes periodically in time : @xmath13\\ ; , \\;{\\rm with}\\,\\ , \\delta(t+t)=\\delta(t ) .",
    "\\label{l of t}\\ ] ] in the case where the frequency of the wall oscillations @xmath14 is twice the frequency of some quantum mode inside the unperturbed cavity , resonant particle ( photon ) creation occurs which makes this scenario the most promising candidate for an experimental verification of this pure quantum effect @xcite .",
    "let us parametrize the vibrations of the ( one - dimensional ) cavity as @xmath15 with @xmath16 for @xmath17 odd and @xmath18 for @xmath17 even .",
    "thereby @xmath19 denotes the frequency of a quantum mode inside the unperturbed cavity of length @xmath20 .    for a one - dimensional cavity oscillating with @xmath21 in the main resonance ,",
    "i.e. the frequency of the cavity vibration is twice the frequency of the first field mode inside the unperturbed cavity @xmath22 , analytical solutions for the total particle number as well as the number of particles created in the resonance mode @xmath23 valid for all times have been found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) under the assumption that the amplitude of the oscillations is very small compared to one ( @xmath24 ) . for the same scenario the rate of particle creation for higher frequency modes and in the limit @xmath25 has been derived in @xcite by evaluating an approximate solution to moore s equation . in @xcite an analytical expression for the number of created particles has been found for more general cavity frequencies but short times only , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "an improved analytical solution to moore s equation is derived in the work @xcite where the authors study the energy density inside the cavity ( see also @xcite ) and show that the total energy in the cavity increases exponentially which was also derived in @xcite .",
    "the interaction ( backreaction ) between the cavity motion and the quantum vacuum inside the cavity has been studied in , e.g. , @xcite . for work regarding the more realistic case of a three - dimensional cavity see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the analytical results mentioned above have been derived by means of approximations such as small amplitudes of the vibrations @xmath27 and some of them are valid only in particular time ranges .",
    "thus even in the extensively studied vibrating cavity scenario there are still open questions .",
    "how does the particle creation look when the assumption @xmath24 is no longer valid and the approximative calculations break down .",
    "how does particle production behave for higher resonance frequencies as studied in @xcite but large times ? in what manner",
    "does the behaviour of the particle production change when considering different kinds of cavity vibrations , for instance @xmath28 and @xmath29 ?",
    "what happens in the case of detuning ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) when the frequency of the cavity vibrations does not exactly match the resonance condition ?    in order to answer these questions and to study the vacuum decay in the dynamical casimir effect for a variety of possibly interesting scenarios where less or even nothing is known analytically like arbitrary wall motions , cavity vibrations with time - varying amplitudes @xmath30 and massive fields , the problem has to be attacked by using numerical methods to account for the coupling of the time dependence of all field modes .",
    "the goal of the paper at hand is to present a particular parametrization for the time evolution of the field modes of a real massless scalar field in a one - dimensional empty cavity @xmath31 $ ] allowing for efficient numerical calculation of the particle production for arbitrary motions @xmath12 of the boundary .",
    "a different numerical approach has been recently presented in @xcite where the author studies the creation of particles in a one - dimensional cavity subject to vibrations of the form @xmath32 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the procedure of canonical quantization of a real scalar field in an empty cavity .",
    "the third section is reserved for the presentation of the formalism yielding a coupled system of first - order differential equations from which the number of produced particles can be deduced by means of standard numerics . in particular",
    "we focus our studies of the particle creation in a vibrating cavity on the motions @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( see fig . [ figure 1 ] ) .",
    "note that the cavity motion @xmath28 exhibits a discontinuity in the velocity at the beginning of the vibrations , i.e. @xmath33 and thus @xmath34 , which can be regarded as a pathological feature of the model .",
    "however , because of the richness of analytical results obtained for this particular scenario ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) we study the particle production for this cavity motion in detail in subsection @xmath35 and compare the numerical results with the analytical predictions . the impact of the initial discontinuity in the velocity of the wall motion is discussed .",
    "in @xmath36 we study the more realistic cavity motion @xmath29 with the smooth initial condition @xmath37 .",
    "we compare the results with the scenario discussed in @xmath35 and comment on the results and conclusions presented in @xcite . in connection with the results for the cavity motion @xmath29 shown in @xmath36 we briefly discuss the effect of detuning in subsection @xmath38 .",
    "finally we show one example for the cavity motion @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure 1 ] ) in @xmath40 and conclude in section 5 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure [ figure 19 ] shows the numerical results obtained for the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath22 .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of the time evolution of the number of created particles looks similar to the one observed for the cavity motion ( [ background 2 ] ) .",
    "but in the case of the motion ( [ background 3 ] ) the shape of the particle spectrum changes drastically compared to the scenarios which we have discussed before [ see fig . [ figure 19 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "now , not only odd but also even modes become excited .",
    "the resonance mode is of course the one which is excited most but a kind of regular structure in the spectrum seems to be absent .",
    "it is suggested that the reason for this irregular spectrum is due to the more complicated structure of the coupling function @xmath43 for the motion ( [ background 3 ] ) compared to ( [ background 1 ] ) and ( [ background 2 ] ) [ see fig . [ figure 1 ] ( b ) ] .",
    "to investigate such phenomena will be part of further work .",
    "we have presented a parametrization for the time evolution of the field modes inside a dynamical cavity allowing for efficient numerical calculation of particle production in the dynamical casimir effect . the creation of real massless scalar particles in a one - dimensional vibrating empty cavity has been studied numerically for three particular wall motions taking the intermode coupling into account .",
    "the comparison of our numerical results obtained for the cavity motion ( [ background 1 ] ) with the analytical predictions derived in @xcite shows that the numerical calculations are reliable and that the introduced method is appropriate to study particle creation in dynamical cavities .",
    "furthermore , the range of validity of the analytical expressions found in @xcite has been investigated .",
    "we have found that the eqs .",
    "( [ dodonov1 ] ) and ( [ dodonov2 ] ) derived in the limit @xmath24 hold to describe the numerical results up to vibration amplitudes of the order of @xmath44 .",
    "the impact of the discontinuity in the velocity of the mirror at the beginning of the motion yielding instantaneous particle creation has been discussed .",
    "these results have been compared with the results obtained for the cavity motion ( [ background 2 ] ) .",
    "the numerical simulations show that the short time behaviours of the number of created particles are similar in both cases , i.e. @xmath45 grows quadratically with time . but the long time behaviours are different .",
    "while for the cavity motion ( [ background 1 ] ) the total particle number increases quadratically for large times ( @xmath46 ) it passes trough a linear regime ( @xmath47 ) for the motion ( [ background 2 ] ) and afterwards slows down further .",
    "the different behaviours of the particle creation for the two cavity motions ( [ background 1 ] ) and ( [ background 2 ] ) yield a different behaviour for the time evolution of the energy associated with the created quantum radiation . we have found that , in accordance with @xcite , the energy in a cavity vibrating with ( [ background 1 ] ) increases exponentially whereas , in the time range under consideration , it obeys a quadratic law ( for @xmath42 and @xmath48 ) in the case of the cavity motion ( [ background 2 ] ) . the explanation for the differences in the behaviour of the particle production for the cavity motions ( [ background 1 ] ) and ( [ background 2 ] ) is that , due to detuning , eq .",
    "( [ background 2 ] ) is not a real resonant cavity motion . without detuning ,",
    "both cavity motions yield the same qualitative behaviour for the time evolution of the particle number . taking this into account",
    ", we may conclude that the discontinuity in the velocity of the cavity motion ( [ background 1 ] ) at the beginning of the dynamics does not strongly affect the long time behaviour of the particle production .",
    "an extension of the presented method to massive fields as well as to higher dimensions is straightforward , which makes it possible to study the particle creation in the dynamical casimir effect for scenarios where no analytical results can be deduced .",
    "the author is grateful to ruth durrer , ralf schtzhold and gnter plunien for valuable and clarifying discussions and comments on the manuscript . furthermore",
    ", the author would like to thank the organizers of the _ international workshop on the dynamical casimir effect _ in padova / italy 2004 ( see @xcite ) for providing such a pleasant atmosphere for discussions . financial support from the swiss national science foundation and the schmidheiny foundation",
