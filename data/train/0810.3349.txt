    "we present the result of a search for a new heavy top - like quark , @xmath0 , assumed to decay to @xmath5 . such would be the case with a `` sequential '' fourth generation in which the bottom - like quark , @xmath7 , has mass such that @xmath8 .",
    "a fourth chiral generation of massive fermions with the same quantum numbers as the known fermions is predicted in a number of models .",
    "it is favored by flavor democracy  @xcite , for example , and arises by unifying spins and charges in the gut so(1,13 ) framework  @xcite .",
    "many theoretical models , some of which are discussed in the @xmath0 search using 0.76 @xmath9 of data  @xcite , predict the presence of new heavy quarks that decay predominantly to @xmath5 . for this reason , we keep the analysis scope broad and do not focus on a specific model .",
    "the mass limits on @xmath0 production quoted assume 100% branching ratio to @xmath5 .",
    "we search for strong pair production of a new heavy @xmath0 quark with its associated antiquark , each decaying to @xmath5 , using the large data set in cdf from run ii of the tevatron . as in the case of @xmath10 production",
    ", this would lead to events with leptons , jets , and missing transverse energy . employing a technique based on event kinematics avoids imposing a @xmath11-quark tagging requirement , which would limit us to the decay mode @xmath12 .",
    "we select events with a lepton ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 ) , missing transverse energy , and four or more hadronic jets . in the standard model",
    "these events topologies can arise from @xmath10 production , @xmath1 plus jets production , and multi - hadronic - jet production from qcd processes .",
    "the observed distribution of total transverse energy , @xmath15 , and reconstructed @xmath0 mass , @xmath16 , allows discrimination of the @xmath0 signal from these backgrounds .",
    "we perform a binned likelihood fit of background and signal to the observed two - dimentsional distribution of @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in this plane ,",
    "the @xmath4 events tend to have larger @xmath15 and @xmath16 than the backgrounds , especially as the @xmath0 mass gets larger .",
    "we calculate the likelihood as a function of @xmath0 signal cross section times branching ratio ( @xmath17 ) and apply bayes theorem assuming a uniform prior in @xmath17 to obtain a 95% cl limit on the rate .",
    "selected lepton plus jets events must have an @xmath13 or @xmath14 having reconstructed @xmath18 above 20 gev/@xmath19 , four or more jets with @xmath20 exceeding 15 gev , having @xmath21  @xcite , and missing transverse energy @xmath22 gev . to insure that leptons and jets are reconstructed from the same interaction ,",
    "the event @xmath23 vertex is required to be within 5 cm of that of the lepton .",
    "in addition , we require that the muons should not be back - to - back with the missing transverse energy : @xmath24 ; this cut removes possibly mis - measured muons . a cut on the leading jet @xmath20 is applied at 60 gev which removes a large fraction of the qcd and w plus jets backgrounds yet keeps over 95% of the signal . for each event",
    "we calculate the mass @xmath16 of the @xmath0 and @xmath25 using the same approach as in the measurement of the top quark mass  @xcite . of the possible combinations , we select the one with the lowest @xmath26 for the hypothesis @xmath27 , demanding that the transverse momenta of the @xmath0 and @xmath25 balance , the reconstructed @xmath0 and @xmath25 masses are equal , and the @xmath1 mass hypothesis is satisfied by the relevant jet pair on one side and by the lepton and @xmath28 on the other .",
    "we use observed data to estimate the qcd contribution , following the same method as in the top cross section measurement .",
    "@xcite we use the alpgen  @xcite monte carlo generator to simulate @xmath1 plus jets events , and the pythia event generator to simulate both @xmath10 and @xmath4 events .",
    "imperfect knowledge of various experimental parameters leads to systematic uncertainties which degrade our sensitivity to a @xmath0 signal .",
    "all systematic uncertainties are represented by `` nuisance '' parameters in the likelihood , and at each point in @xmath17 we maximize the likelihood with respect to the values of the nuisance parameters , most of which are gaussian - constrained to particular values .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainty is that due to imperfect knowledge of the jet energy scale .",
    "the nuisance parameter representing this effect controls how the @xmath15-@xmath16 distribution changes ( `` morphs '' ) as the jet energy scale changes within its uncertainties .",
    "this morphing includes both shape and normalization uncertainties simultaneously .",
    "another important systematic uncertainty is due to the lack of knowledge of the appropriate @xmath29 scale at which the @xmath1 plus jets processes should be evaluated .",
    "we take the larger of the shifts in apparent @xmath17 due to changing the @xmath29 scale from the nominal choice of @xmath18 by a factor of two as the magnitude of this uncertainty .",
    "other systematic effects include those due to inperfect knowledge of the integrated luminosity ( 5.9% ) , the lepton identification efficiencies ( 0.7% ) , and the qcd background normalization ( 50% ) .",
    "as we have poor knowledge of the @xmath1 plus jets cross section , this parameter is free to float in the binned likleihood fit .",
    "the likelihoods as a function of @xmath17 reveal no significant excess attributable to @xmath4 production .",
    "figure  [ fig - fit ] shows the observed data distributions projected into the @xmath16 and @xmath15 dimensions .",
    "the figures compare the observed distributions with the fit to the background plus a 300 gev/@xmath6 @xmath0 , where the @xmath17 of the @xmath0 signal corresponds to that which we exclude with 95% confidence .",
    "( left ) and @xmath15 ( right ) .",
    "the predicted distribution corresponds to that for a 300 gev/@xmath6 mass @xmath0 signal with a cross section times branching ratio at the 95% cl upper limit.,title=\"fig:\",width=332 ]   ( left ) and @xmath15 ( right ) .",

    "figure  [ fig - limit ] shows these curves , and compres our observed limits to the range of those expected .",
    "we take the point in @xmath0 mass where the observed limit crosses the theoretical cross section as the lower bound on the mass of the @xmath0 , 311 gev/@xmath6 , at 95% cl ."
