    "the number of transactions executed in online marketplaces such as ebay is soaring up . to buy a desired item , a buyer must first trust in a seller by paying in advance . because the seller may lose little by dismissing a single buyer , the seller may be tempted to ship a counterfeit item or may not even transport the purchase to the buyer .",
    "if many sellers behave maliciously toward buyers , the marketplace would collapse .",
    "here is a moral hazard .",
    "a classical example in which counterfeit items would prevail is the `` market for lemons '' or the used car market @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , many auction sites and related online services , including opinion forums , price comparison sites , and product review sites , enjoy prosperity without seriously being swamped by the malicious behavior of users @xcite .",
    "the main mechanism to elicit the cooperative behavior of sellers in such a social dilemma situation is the online reputation management system , also called the feedback mechanism @xcite .",
    "when a reputation management system is implemented , a buyer is invited to evaluate the seller after a transaction so that other buyers can refer to the reputation of this seller in the future . a seller with a good overall reputation",
    "would successfully sell items to many buyers in the long run , whereas a seller with a bad reputation would be avoided by buyers . in a seminal paper ,",
    "klein and leffler analyzed the role of reputations in alleviating a moral hazard @xcite .",
    "reputation mechanisms in online marketplaces are often cited as a successful example of indirect reciprocity @xcite . indirect reciprocity ( precisely , downstream or vicarious reciprocity as its major subtype @xcite ) is a mechanism for the alleviation of social dilemmas .",
    "it dictates that an individual @xmath0 with a good reputation is helped by another individual that @xmath0 has not met .",
    "@xmath0 may also help other individuals that @xmath0 does not know .",
    "in fact , most buyer - seller pairs conduct only one transaction on ebay , such that a buyer probably does not know the seller with whom the buyer is about to transact @xcite .",
    "it is theoretically established that indirect reciprocity enables cooperation in social dilemma games under proper conditions @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism governing cooperation between unacquainted buyers and sellers observed in real online transactions does not resemble that provided by these models .",
    "the existing models of indirect reciprocity are mostly based on the donation game , which is a type of social dilemma games . in the donation game ,",
    "two players are chosen from a population , one as donor and the other as recipient .",
    "if the donor helps the recipient , the recipient gains a benefit , which is larger than the cost that the donor is charged .",
    "if the donor does not help the recipient , the donor and the recipient gain nothing .",
    "the donor s help contributes to social welfare , whereas the donor is better off withholding the help .    in the previous models of indirect reciprocity @xcite",
    ", each player is selected as many times as donor and recipient per generation ( we discuss an exception @xcite in the discussion ) .",
    "therefore , the players are essentially involved in a symmetric prisoner s dilemma game .",
    "in contrast , the social dilemma game effectively played in online marketplaces is a highly asymmetric game .",
    "buyers and sellers are distinct roles that each individual does not play with equal probability @xcite . in addition , in the donation game and the symmetric prisoner s dilemma , there is no concept wherein one player invests trust in a peer player in the one - shot game .",
    "theoretical models of reputation - based cooperation using different social dilemma games such as the ultimatum game also assume symmetrization of the two roles @xcite .",
    "this is also the case for the models of reputation - based cooperation analyzed in economic literature @xcite .",
    "the trust game @xcite seems to be a much better model for online marketplaces @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schem trust game ] , the buyer , also called the investor , first decides whether to buy an item from the seller .",
    "if the buyer buys , the seller , also called the trustee , decides whether to ship the appropriate item to the buyer .",
    "if the buyer buys and the seller does not ship , succumbing to the temptation to defect , the seller gains the largest payoff 1 , and the buyer gains the smallest payoff @xmath1 .",
    "if the buyer buys and the seller ships , both players obtain a relatively large payoff @xmath2 , where @xmath3 .",
    "if the buyer does not buy , both players gain a relatively small payoff 0 , which is the unique nash equilibrium of the game .",
    "a cooperative society is realized when the buyer buys and the seller ships . in laboratory experiments ,",
    "humans cooperate to some extent in the trust game @xcite , and reputation mechanisms enhance cooperation @xcite .",
    "the trust game with a reputation mechanism also approximates the situation of commerce conducted by the medieval maghribi traders @xcite and the market for lemons ( if a gossip - based reputation mechanism is operational ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown in a seminal paper that cooperation based on reputations is possible in the essentially asymmetric trust game @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , several important questions in this framework are theoretically unresolved .",
    "is cooperation more ubiquitous than uncooperation , in particular when these two situations are both stable equilibria ?",
    "how do different reputation - based strategies of buyers compete in a population ? how does the reputation - based cooperation emerge through population dynamics ?",
    "non - evolutionary numerical results for the trust game with reputation mechanisms @xcite do not explain the stability and emergence of cooperation .",
    "an evolutionary theory @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite showed that reputations induce cooperation in the trust game .",
    "however , in these papers , each player serves the two roles with equal probability such that the game is essentially the symmetric prisoner s dilemma .",
    "we theoretically clarify the possibility of reputation - based cooperation in the trust game by analyzing the nash equilibria and the coevolutionary replicator dynamics of buyers and sellers .",
    "we show that coevolution of cooperative buyers and sellers is realized relatively easily . in particular , the fraction of buyers that score sellers does not have to be large , and many buyers do not discriminate between good and bad sellers even when cooperation prevails .",
    "we analyze equilibria and evolutionary dynamics of the trust game ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schem trust game ] ) in an infinite population of four types of buyers and two types of sellers under a reputation mechanism .",
    "each seller possesses the binary reputation , good ( g ) or bad ( b ) , that dynamically changes as a result of the single - shot trust game .",
    "referring to the two reputations as g and b is purely conventional .    in a time unit",
    ", each seller @xmath4 plays the trust game with a randomly chosen buyer @xmath5 . the buyer @xmath5 first decides whether to buy an item from @xmath4 possibly on the basis of @xmath4 s reputation .",
    "if @xmath5 does not buy , no transaction occurs , leaving the payoff 0 to both @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 buys , @xmath4 decides whether to ship the item ( cooperate ; c ) or not ( defect ; d ) . if @xmath4 ships the item , then both @xmath5 and @xmath4 obtain @xmath2 . if @xmath4 does not ship the item and exploits @xmath5 , @xmath4 gains 1 , and @xmath5 gains @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath6 , it is beneficial for both players to cooperate . if @xmath7 , transaction would never occur irrespective of the reputation mechanism .",
    "we set @xmath3 to represent the social dilemma .",
    "we repeat the procedure explained above for @xmath8 time units such that each player plays the trust game @xmath8 times on an average .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 such that the probability that the same pair of buyer and seller interact more than once within time @xmath8 is infinitesimally small .      when @xmath5 decides to buy , @xmath5 assigns g or b to @xmath4 on the basis of @xmath4 s action .",
    "the new reputation of @xmath4 is instantaneously propagated to the entire population such that any buyer can refer to this information when playing with @xmath4 in later times .",
    "we refer to the rule according to which the buyer assigns a reputation to the seller as a social norm .    an intuitively rational social norm , which reputation mechanisms in successful online marketplaces apply , is to assign g and b when @xmath4 has cooperated and defected , respectively .",
    "this norm is called image scoring @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xmath5 may assign g no matter whether @xmath4 cooperates or defects .",
    "we call this social norm indifferent scoring .",
    "a buyer is assumed to commit the assignment error with probability @xmath10 such that the seller receives a reputation that is contrary to what is expected from the social norm .",
    "in fact , some but not all of the buyers may be interested in rating sellers @xcite . to investigate this scenario , we consider a case in which a buyer has a unique scoring type as well as strategy .",
    "we assume that a fraction of @xmath11 and @xmath12 buyers are image scorers and indifferent scorers , respectively .",
    "we also assume that the scoring type does not affect the buyer s payoff , such that the fraction of image scorers in the population does not change in the course of the replicator dynamics .",
    "alternatively , we can assume that each buyer is a permanent indifferent scorer or permanent image scorer .",
    "this assumption may be controversial .",
    "we will return to this issue in discussion .",
    "we do not assume the reputation for buyers because in online marketplaces , the impact of the seller s reputation is much larger than that of the buyer s reputation @xcite .",
    "previous laboratory experiments that modeled the situation in auction sites also neglected the reputation of buyers @xcite .",
    "the probability that the buyer decides to buy from g and b sellers is denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we consider four strategies for buyers : unconditional buyer ( buy ) specified by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ; discriminator ( disc ) specified by @xmath17 , @xmath18 ; anti - discriminator ( antidisc ) specified by @xmath19 , @xmath20 ; and unconditional no - buyer ( nobuy ) specified by @xmath21 .    as introduced in section `` trust game '' , sellers have two strategies , c and d. for simplicity , we assume that the seller s action is deterministic , whereas the buyer s action is stochastic .",

    "the introduction of antidisc does not inhibit the evolution of cooperation .",
    "for the trust game , we have shown that cooperation between unacquainted buyers and sellers can be established under the image scoring norm ( i.e. , reputation mechanism ) . in the cooperative equilibrium ,",
    "the population of buyers ( i.e. , investors ) is a mixture of buy ( unconditional buyer ) and disc ( discriminator that decides whether to buy depending on the seller s reputation ) .",
    "the majority of sellers ( i.e. , trustees ) reciprocates the buyer s trust although the sellers are not expected to meet the same buyers again .",
    "it should be noted that not every buyer discriminates between good and bad sellers in the cooperative equilibrium .",
    "this feature is shared by some previous models of indirect reciprocity @xcite .",
    "the probability of discriminators can be small depending on the parameter values .",
    "in addition , the buyer s reputation may be of little practical use for maintaining cooperative transactions .",
    "this claim is consistent with the previous theoretical result @xcite and the empirical finding that reputation for a seller has a greater impact than that for a buyer @xcite .",
    "our model and results are distinct from previous ones obtained from the models using the symmetrized donation game , which we call indirect reciprocity games for now @xcite .",
    "first , when cooperation prevails , a player with a good reputation is helped by unacquainted players in the indirect reciprocity games . in our model",
    ", a seller with a good reputation wins the trust , not explicit help , of unacquainted buyers . by reciprocating the buyer s trust ,",
    "the seller obtains a relatively large momentary payoff and a good reputation .",
    "then , a good reputation elicits trust and long - term cooperation from buyers .",
    "a second difference is in the consequence of the image scoring . in the indirect reciprocity games , defection against a bad player",
    "is regarded to be bad under the image scoring .",
    "therefore , the image scoring does not yield cooperation @xcite . in contrast , in our model ,",
    "a discriminative buyer ( i.e. , disc ) that defects against ( i.e. , does not buy from ) a bad seller does not receive a bad reputation .",
    "this is because buyers do not own reputation scores by definition ; the asymmetry of roles in the trust game allows the image scoring to support cooperation .",
    "although a previous paper discussed this issue before @xcite , we analytically derived the conditions under which cooperation based on the image scoring occurs .",
    "it should be noted that the image scoring norm is simpler than the social norms required for cooperation in the indirect reciprocity games @xcite .    in other models",
    ", the mere reputation mechanism enables cooperation among unacquainted players in the trust game @xcite and other games @xcite .",
    "however , the component social dilemma game in these studies is essentially symmetric .",
    "our model is inherently asymmetric such that a player is either a permanent buyer or permanent seller .",
    "as compared to a recent paper in which impacts of asymmetric roles in the trust game are numerically studied @xcite , we analytically established the conditions under which reputation - based cooperation occurs in the asymmetric trust game . in online marketplaces @xcite , the market for lemons @xcite , and presumably many other transaction scenes , some people may participate entirely or mostly as buyers and others as sellers .",
    "the constructive role of reputations for the trustee ( i.e. , seller ) in asymmetric interactions was formulated in a classic paper many years ago @xcite .",
    "our contribution to the understanding of this established mechanism is that we have clarified competition among different strategies using evolutionary game theory .",
    "we have investigated a scenario in which indifferent scorers , which do not essentially score sellers , and image scorers coexist in a buyer s population .",
    "remarkably , the fraction of image scorers needed for cooperation is not large ; eq .",
    "indicates that the threshold fraction of image scorers is equal to 0.60 for @xmath188 and 0.038 for @xmath189 when @xmath186 and @xmath181 .",
    "an alternative assumption for the behavior of indifferent scorers is that they do not alter sellers scores rather than always give a good reputation to sellers .",
    "analysis of this case is warranted for future work",
    ".    an important limitation of the present study is that the fraction of indifferent scorers and that of image scorers are invariant over time . in other words ,",
    "indifferent and image scorers are assumed to receive the same payoff if the strategy ( buy , disc , antidisc , or nobuy ) is the same .",
    "in fact , the image scoring may be more costly than the indifferent scoring because the image scorer has to know and report whether sellers cooperate or defect .",
    "therefore , an image scorer may be tempted to turn into an indifferent scorer if the incentive to rate sellers is absent @xcite .",
    "a similar cost is briefly mentioned in previous literature in the context of indirect reciprocity games @xcite . in our model",
    ", cooperation disappears if there are too many indifferent scorers .",
    "this result parallels with that for the indirect reciprocity games in which cooperation is not realized if there are too few observers in the one - shot game @xcite . in practice , rewarding image scorers and shutting down indifferent scorers access to reputation information , for example , are means to circumvent the scoring cost @xcite .",
    "we remark that the competition of social norms was analyzed in different models of indirect reciprocity @xcite .    in the context of asymmetric interaction between cleaner and client fishes ,",
    "indirect reciprocity was investigated in an inherently asymmetric variant of the trust game with a binary internal state for the trustee @xcite .",
    "our model and results are distinct from theirs . in their model ,",
    "a trustee reciprocates and attracts the investor when the trustee is in one particular state and exploits the investor by switching to the other state .",
    "the trustee does not steadily maintain a good reputation and uses the temporarily good reputation to exploit the investor .",
    "the authors acknowledge that their mechanism is different from the conventional concept of indirect reciprocity . in our model ,",
    "the trustee ( i.e. , seller ) steadily maintains a good reputation to invoke help from the investor ( i.e. , buyer ) .",
    "our results suggest that , under appropriate conditions , the conventional indirect reciprocity may be established between cleaner and client fishes without resorting to the concept of the binary state .",
    "finally , beyond the relevance to online transactions , our results provide a firm solution to the moral hazard problem that is represented by the trust game .",
    "examples include offline markets @xcite such as the market for lemons @xcite and labor markets @xcite .",
    "implementing a reputation mechanism only for the seller ( i.e. , investee ) induces trust and cooperation between unacquainted individuals in the trust game .",

    "<S> we study the equilibria and the replicator dynamics of the game . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the reputation mechanism enables cooperation between unacquainted buyers and sellers under fairly generous conditions , even when such a cooperative equilibrium coexists with an asocial equilibrium in which buyers do not buy and sellers cheat . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show that not many buyers may care about the seller s reputation under cooperative equilibrium . buyers trusting behavior and sellers reputation - driven cooperative behavior coevolve to alleviate the social dilemma . </S>"
