    "emission lines arising from transitions in sulphur - like fexi have been detected in the spectra of a range of astrophysical sources , including the sun ( dere 1978 ) and other cool stars ( laming & drake 1999 ) , as well as active galaxies ( puchnarewicz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the usefulness of these lines as electron density diagnostics for the emitting plasma was first shown by kastner & mason ( 1978 ) , who employed the atomic physics calculations of mason ( 1975 ) to generate theoretical emission - line ratios for this ion . since then , several authors have calculated atomic data and theoretical line ratios for fexi , particularly for applications to solar spectra ( see bhatia et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "most work on the solar spectrum of fexi has focused on the @xmath0180200   wavelength range , containing 3s@xmath53p@xmath63s@xmath53p@xmath73d transitions ( see , for example , keenan et al .",
    "this is understandable , as this wavelength region contains numerous strong fexi lines ( including the most intense in the solar spectrum ) , many of which provide good electron density diagnostics .",
    "however , the @xmath0257407  region also contains several fexi lines , primarily arising from 3s@xmath53p@xmath63s3p@xmath8 transitions . in this paper",
    "we use the most recent atomic physics calculations for fexi to analyse solar spectra covering this wavelength region .",
    "specifically , we investigate observational data sets from two missions , namely the extreme - ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on board the _ hinode _ satellite , and the solar extreme - ultraviolet research telescope and spectrograph ( serts ) sounding rocket experiments .",
    "the eis long wavelength channel spectral region is 245291  ( culhane et al .",
    "2007 ) , compared to @xmath0235449   for the serts first - order bandpass ( neupert et al .",
    "1992 ) , and both have spectral resolutions of about 0.06  ( fwhm ) . although serts has a larger wavelength coverage , in principle allowing more lines from the same species to be detected , it has a limited dynamic range as most spectra have been recorded on photographic film .",
    "by contrast , eis spectra are obtained with ccds , and hence can reliably detect weaker lines .",
    "the combination of wavelength coverage and dynamic range provided by serts and eis allows us to undertake a detailed assessment of the fexi emission - line spectrum in the 257407wavelength region .",
    "the model ion adopted for fexi has been discussed in detail by keenan et al .",
    "briefly , it consisted of the 24 energetically lowest ls states , yielding a total of 48 fine - structure levels .",
    "experimental energy levels , where available , were obtained from shirai et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and jupn et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , with the theoretical results of aggarwal & keenan ( 2003a ) being used for the remainder .",
    "electron impact rates were taken from aggarwal & keenan ( 2003b ) , while for einstein a - coefficients the data of aggarwal & keenan ( 2003a ) were employed .",
    "finally , under solar plasma conditions proton impact excitation is only important for transitions within the 3s@xmath53p@xmath6 @xmath7p ground term , and we have used the calculations of landman ( 1980 ) for this atomic process .    using the model ion outlined above , in conjunction with an updated version of the statistical equilibrium code of dufton ( 1977 ) , relative fexi emission - line strengths were calculated as a function of both electron temperature ( t@xmath1 ) and density ( n@xmath1 ) .",
    "details of the procedures involved and approximations made may be found in dufton ( 1977 ) and dufton et al .",
    "given errors in the adopted atomic data of typically @xmath910 per cent ( see the references above ) , we would expect the theoretical ratios to be accurate to better than @xmath920 per cent .",
    "the solar spectra analysed in the present paper are from two instruments , namely the eis on board the _ hinode _ satellite , and several serts rocket flights .",
    "our eis data sets are those of an active region and limb area originally presented and discussed by brown et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , to which the reader is referred for details of the eis instrument and the data reduction and flux calibration procedures .",
    "these two features , denoted ar1 and limb by brown et al . , show the strongest fexi emission lines of the solar regions considered by these authors .",
    "the spectra are from the eis long wavelength channel and cover 245291  at a resolution of about 55m  ( fwhm ) .",
    "our serts spectra are those of several quiet and active regions , plus an off - limb area , obtained during rocket flights in 1989 ( denoted serts89 ) , 1991 ( serts91 ) , 1993 ( serts93 ) and 1997 ( serts97 ) .",
    "details of these observations , including their reduction and flux calibration , may be found in thomas & neupert ( 1994 ) for serts89 , brosius et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for serts91 and serts93 , and brosius et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for serts97 .",
    "most of these data sets cover the 235 - 449  ( serts89 ) or 231445",
    "( serts91 and serts93 ) wavelength regions in first - order , at resolutions of between 5080m , with spectra recorded on photographic film",
    ". however , the intensity calibrations for the serts91 and serts93 spectra are highly uncertain for wavelengths shorter than 274 .",
    "by contrast , the serts97 spectrum spans 299353  in first - order , at a resolution of 115m , and was recorded on a ccd .",
    "we note that the version of serts flown in 1989 carried a standard gold - coated toroidal diffraction grating , while those in 1991 , 1993 and 1997 incorporated a multilayered - coated grating which enhanced the instrument sensitivity in the first - order wavelength range , by factors of up to 9 .",
    "in addition , the absolute intensity calibration of the serts89 spectrum has been re - evaluated since the publication of thomas & neupert , as a result of which emission - line intensities are uniformly a factor of 1.24 larger than those quoted in that paper ( see , for example , keenan et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "we have searched for fexi emission lines in the eis and serts spectra using the detections of brown et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and thomas & neupert ( 1994 ) , supplemented with those from other sources , including the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) data base , the latest version ( v6.0 ) of the chianti data base ( dere et al .",
    "1997 , 2009 ) , and the atomic line list of van hoof.peter/atomic/ ] in table 1 we list the fexi transitions identified in the data sets , along with their measured wavelengths .",
    "we also provide a note on each line , including whether it is detected in both eis and serts spectra , and if there are possible blending features .

    "+ @xmath12factor by which the theoretical line ratio varies between n@xmath1 = 10@xmath2 and 10@xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "an inspection of table 13 reveals that the densities derived from 308.54/352.67 are generally in very good agreement with those estimated for the serts solar features from line ratios in species formed at similar temperatures to fexi , which as noted in section 4.2 average about log n@xmath1 = 9.4 @xmath9 0.3 for active regions and log n@xmath1 = 9.1 @xmath9 0.3 for quiet sun and off - limb areas .",
    "hence we can state that , in general , the 308.54/352.67 ratio appears to provide a good n@xmath1diagnostic .",
    "the exception is the serts89 active region , where the derived density is more than an order of magnitude larger than expected .",
    "however , as already discussed in section 4.2 , there are problems with the 308.54  feature in the serts89 active region observations which make its measurement uncertain .",
    "the electron density derived for the serts97 active region from the 349.04/352.67 ratio is in good agreement with those found from other species , but in the case of the serts89 active region the density is much higher than expected .",
    "however , as noted by thomas & neupert ( 1994 ) , the 349.04  line in the serts89 observations is blended with the second - order fex 174.52  feature .",
    "we can estimate its contribution using the nearby fex 177.24  transition , which appears in first - order at 354.48 .",
    "the first - order intensity of this line is 3.6 erg@xmath13s@xmath14sr@xmath14 , and the 174.52  feature is predicted to be a factor of 1.8 stronger ( keenan et al .",
    "2008 ) , yielding an intensity of 6.5 erg@xmath13s@xmath14sr@xmath14 .",
    "this in turn gives a corrected intensity for fexi 349.04  of 19.7 erg@xmath13s@xmath14sr@xmath14 , and revised experimental 349.04/352.67 ratio of 0.12 . from figure 5",
    ", this implies n@xmath1 = 10@xmath15@xmath4 , in good agreement with other diagnostics .",
    "although the 308.54/352.67 ratio is probably the most useful fexi density diagnostic currently available in the 257407  wavelength range , 349.04/352.67 is superior in many respects .",
    "the lines are closer together , reducing the effects of possible errors in the instrument intensity calibration , and the ratio varies by a larger factor over the density range n@xmath1 = 10@xmath210@xmath3@xmath4 ( 14.7 c.f . 8.4 for 308.54/352.67 ) .",
    "however , the 349.04  feature is relatively weak , and is also blended with fex 174.52 , unless the first - order instrument response is enhanced , as for the serts97 observations .",
