    "quantum correlations has been in the core of recent developments exploring the interface between quantum and classical physics @xcite . quantum entanglement and other quantum correlations",
    "are widely considered for the engineering of quantum information protocols , in particular for quantum cryptography @xcite and quantum computing processes @xcite .",
    "the non - local coherence generated by entanglement is essential to various applications of such quantum information / computing tasks in physical systems @xcite .",
    "one platform suitable for implementing and characterizing quantum correlations is the ion - trap technology @xcite , which has provided a phenomenological access to generate and manipulate quantum correlational properties of the trapped ions @xcite .",
    "moreover , the trapped ion setup has also been engendered for simulation protocols , such as for simulating open quantum systems and quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "simulating dirac equation structures is another example of a quantum system engendered by trapped ion dynamics . under suitable conditions ,",
    "the ionic ( anti)jaynes - cummings ( ( a)jc ) hamiltonian dynamics can be mapped onto the structure of the dirac equation , reproducing a series of relativistic - like quantum effects @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the two-_quibt _ intrinsic entanglement present on the @xmath0 bi - spinor structure of dirac equation solutions is also encoded in the ionic system simulating the dirac dynamics by quantum numbers related to the total angular momentum and to its projection onto the direction of the external magnetic field ( which is applied for lift the degeneracy of the ions internal levels ) @xcite .    a quantum system not isolated has its correlational properties affected by the coupling with its environment .",
    "fluctuations of the external magnetic field acts as an environment , causing entanglement degradation and a consequent decoherence @xcite . to include such environment effects on the trapped ion two-_qubit _ structure considered in @xcite , as well as to elucidate how the local decoherece is related to local and non - local disentanglement , a noise model for the environment can be adopted to describe more realistic setups @xcite .",
    "this letter is concerned with the effects of a local noise model , where each subsystem is individually affected by the environment , in the informational content of internal states of a four level trapped ion .",
    "the local noise is included via kraus operators and the dynamics of an arbitrary ionic state is recovered through the connection between the ( a)jc dynamics and the dirac equation structure .",
    "once the dirac - like spinor density matrix is constructed , the quantum entanglement can be quantified through negativity @xcite . due to the coupling with the environment",
    ", an initial pure state evolves into a separable mixed state , which can display quantum correlations other than entanglement .",
    "in particular , the geometric discord @xcite shall be adopted as a measure of such quantum correlations . for quantum states constrained to a specific ionic level",
    ", sudden deaths and quantum revivals can be quantified by the intrinsic entanglement .",
    "moreover , those states exhibit residual nonclassical correlations for intervals were the state is separable .",
    "on the other hand , when the maximally entangled ( werner and schrdinger cat ) quantum states  prepared as superposition of such internal levels  are considered , coupling to environment causes a partially lost of their initially entangled properties , but no entanglement sudden death is present . in the three states considered , entanglement oscillations , caused by their noiseless dynamics , are observed .",
    "the trapped ion framework can be formulated by a hamiltonian @xmath1 which , in the rotating wave approximation @xcite , includes three interactions , the ( anti ) jaynes - cummings and the carrier interactions .",
    "the ( a)jc interactions are given by the hamiltonian @xmath2 with @xmath3 , where the phases @xmath4 describe red(blue)-sideband excitations , @xmath5 are the rabi frequencies , @xmath6 are the internal level raising(lowering ) operators , @xmath7 is an emergent detuning frequency between the external field and the two - level system , and @xmath8 is the lamb - dicke parameter ( where @xmath9 is the ion mass and @xmath10 is the wave number of the external field ) .",
    "the jc interaction corresponds to a de - excitation of the internal level accompanied by an excitation of the vibrational degree of freedom , while the ajc interaction accomplished an excitation of the internal level with an excitation of the vibrational degree of freedom .",
    "the carrier interaction is given by @xmath11 which excites the internal levels without changing the vibrational state of the ion . from the experimental perspective , the above described dynamics is observed , for example , in the hyperfine levels ( @xmath12 ) of alkali ions .    for now on , we consider a trapped ion with four internal levels labeled @xmath13 . the combination of jc , ajc and carrier interactions acting on such system can be mapped into a dirac hamiltonian including tensor and pseudotensor external fields @xcite , @xmath14 from which one firstly notices that the dirac mass and kinetic term reads @xmath15 @xmath16 such that , for example , @xmath17 , where the upper indices denote the involved internal levels @xcite .",
    "the momenta @xmath18 are given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the delocalization width of the ground state wave function .",
    "the tensor and pseudotensor external potential are mapped in terms of the carrier interactions ( [ eqea03 ] ) with frequencies @xmath21 and @xmath22 :    [ eqea06 ] @xmath23 @xmath24 [ eqea06b ]    the dirac dynamics driven by ( [ diracham ] ) is reproduced in the trapped ion setup through the maps ( [ eqea04 ] ) , ( [ eqea05 ] ) and ( [ eqea06b ] ) and the relations between dirac and ionic parameters are identified as @xmath25 which set a one - to - one correspondence between ( [ diracham ] ) and the sum of the interactions ( [ eqea04 ] ) , ( [ eqea05 ] ) and ( [ eqea06b ] ) .",
    "accordingly , the bispinor eigenstates of ( [ diracham ] ) @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 ) , are described as linear combinations of the internal ionic levels , @xmath28 each of the ionic state @xmath29 is characterized by two quantum number @xmath30 , the total angular momentum and @xmath31 , the projection of the angular momentum onto an external magnetic field used for lift the degeneracy of the internal ionic levels .",

    "one is inclined to consider environment effects on the trapped ion dynamics .",
    "the inclusion of such open systems effects can be accomplished by an effective hamiltonian @xmath61 describing environment coupling as to have a total hamiltonian given by @xmath62 in particular , the influence of an environment is included through the influence of two _ local _ noises , generated by random fluctuations acting separately on each qubit which is given by the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath63 in this model , separate fluctuations acts on the corresponding subsystem and the fields @xmath64 are characterized by markovian conditions @xmath65 were @xmath66 represent the ensemble average and @xmath67 are the phase relaxations due to the local interactions .",
    "this setup was previously considered for study phonon decoherence @xcite , for protocols to measure magnetic field gradient @xcite in the trapped ion framework , and for investigating the influence of noise on transport properties in chains of trapped ions @xcite .",
    "here it is supposed that the fluctuations on the degeneracy lifting magnetic field affect each degree of freedom individually .",
    "other often considered noise model is the _ global _ noise @xcite in which the random fluctuations act equally on both qubits .",
    "the influence of such environment will be investigated in a future issue .",
    "the temporal evolution driven by the total hamiltonian @xmath68 ( [ tothamil ] ) , can be recovered by decoupling it into two pieces through the interaction picture : @xmath69 with @xmath70 being the initial state and @xmath71 describing the time - evolved density matrix in the interaction picture , which is a solution of the corresponding master equation given in terms of the kraus representation @xcite . the inclusion of noise effects through kraus representation is thus implemented by taking the statistical mean of eq .",
    "( [ master01 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath71 under the influence of the local noise described by the hamiltonian ( [ eqe02 ] ) is then expressed in a compact way as @xmath72 where the kraus operators describing the local interaction ( [ eqe02 ] ) are given by : @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for simplicity",
    "it is adopted equal phase relaxations on both subsystems , i.e. @xmath76 .",
    "after the above described procedure , to recover schrdinger picture density matrix one uses the completeness relation for the eigenstates @xmath77 as to have @xmath78 from which any observable can be evaluated for any given initial state @xmath70 .",
    "from now on , the disentangling properties of ionic states under local noise effects can be investigated .",
    "in particular we shall consider the evolution of the internal ionic state @xmath79 , and the evolution of the schrdinger cat state @xmath80 and of the werner state @xmath81 , which are written in terms of internal ionic states as @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "accordingly to the peres criterion , any separable state must have all eigenvalues of its partial transpose density matrix positive @xcite .",

    "separable mixed states can exhibit quantum correlations other than entanglement @xcite , and the characterization of such quantum correlations is still an open problem . the quantum discord , defined as the difference between total correlations among two subsystems before and after the action of perfect local measurements in one of them , is a quantifier for nonclassical correlations @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of quantum discord requires an extremization procedure over all possible sets of local measurements in one of the subsystems , being a np - hard problem with no analytical solution or even efficient algorithm ( unless @xmath89 ) @xcite . to avoid such computational issue",

    "the noiseless evolution drives the state to a superposition among all the internal states for @xmath108 , generating intrinsic entanglement .",
    "nevertheless the influence of the local noise suddenly vanishes the entanglement in an effect known as entanglement sudden death , which is follows by sudden revivals in a oscillation pattern without definite frequency . in the intervals",

    "the issue investigated throughout this letter is concerned with the inclusion of local noise effects , described by stochastic fields acting on four ionic levels , in the context of a dirac - like dynamics simulated by the trapped ion systems .",
    "the entanglement properties were quantified in terms of negativity and the quantum correlations were quantified by means of the geometric discord , where the noiseless dynamics of ionic states was recovered through the correspondence between jc , ajc and carrier interactions through the inclusion of tensor and pseudotensor dirac structures into the simulated hamiltonian .",
    "the noise was introduced by means of the kraus representation formalism , such that quantum correlations of states prepared as internal levels of the trapped ion were then investigated .",
    "the quantum correlational properties exhibited by a state initially on a single level , and by werner and schrdinger cat states formed by superpositions between two internal ionic levels were finally obtained .    under local noise , for werner and schrdinger cat states ,",
    "the entanglement is partially lost , but entanglement oscillations are still present due to the pureness of both states for @xmath110 .",
    "the mass parameter on the dirac hamiltonian actively suppress the entanglement content of the states . for a state initially on the @xmath112 internal level of the ion , entanglement shows sudden deaths and sudden revivals , which are driven by the coupled dynamics with the environment .",
    "for such state , the noise also suppress quantum correlations other than entanglement , and in the intervals were the state is separable it exhibits residual quantum correlations .",
    "one concludes by noticing that such trapped ion platforms can work to implement more complex quantum simulations @xcite where , from the beginning , the only observable that can be measured ( through fluorescence techniques ) still is @xmath113 , related to issues that deserve some further investigations",
