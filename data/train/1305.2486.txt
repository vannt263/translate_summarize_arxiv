    "one of the origins of spectral theory lies in the investigation of vibrating strings : the equations describing small transversal vibrations of an inhomogeneous string , which is clamped between its endpoints at @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 represents the displacement of the string .",
    "hereby @xmath4 denotes the mass density of the string , which is stretched by a unit force . employing the common separation of variables method for this equation , one",
    "is led to the spectral problem @xmath5 which is of fundamental importance for solving the wave equation  .",
    "mark krein was the first one to deal with a corresponding inverse spectral problem ( which is why   is usually termed krein string ) .",
    "given the spectrum associated with   together with so - called norming constants , he managed to find the corresponding weight density @xmath4 .",
    "in particular , he was the first to notice that an elementary case of this inverse problem can be solved by virtue of the theory on continued fractions by thomas stieltjes . thus , this particular case , where @xmath4 is a finite sum of weighted dirac measures , is usually referred to as stieltjes strings .",
    "the solution of the corresponding inverse spectral problem can be written down explicitly in terms of the finite set of spectral data . for several surveys on direct and inverse spectral theory for krein strings we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another kind of inverse spectral problem is the so - called inverse three - spectra problem .",
    "hereby , the norming constants are replaced by two additional spectra , which are obtained by clamping the string at some interior point @xmath6 .",
    "this type of inverse problem was first introduced in @xcite for schrdinger operators ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . following this ,",
    "corresponding inverse problems have been investigated in @xcite , @xcite for sturm  liouville operators with distributional potentials , in @xcite , @xcite for jacobi operators and in @xcite for operators corresponding to certain oscillating systems . in the context of krein strings ,",
    "the inverse three - spectra problem has been solved in @xcite for the class of stieltjes strings and in @xcite for the class of krein strings , which have a trace class resolvent .",
    "let us mention that there is typically an issue with non - uniqueness , already noticed in @xcite . in order to overcome this problem",
    ", one has to introduce additional spectral quantities ; see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "regarding the interval @xmath7 as a two - edged graph with central vertex @xmath8 , the inverse three - spectra problem can also be viewed as an inverse spectral problem for a star graph . from this perspective , the given spectral data comprise the spectrum associated with the whole graph as well as the spectra associated with the two edges of the graph .",
    "of course , this immediately suggests a natural generalization of the inverse three - spectra problem to general star graphs with finitely many edges .",
    "this problem has been dealt with in @xcite , @xcite for schrdinger operators and in @xcite , @xcite for stieltjes strings . in the present article , we will give a complete solution of the corresponding inverse spectral problem for a class of star graphs of krein strings .    setting the stage ,",
    "let @xmath9 be a planar star graph with finitely many edges .",
    "we think of this graph as a system of inhomogeneous strings , joined at the central vertex of the graph and clamped at the outer vertices .",
    "the ( vertical ) displacement of such a web of strings can be described by a real - valued function @xmath3 on @xmath10 and its mass density by a non - negative function ( respectively , a borel measure ) @xmath4 on @xmath10 .",
    "the equations describing the motion of this system are analogous to the first one in   for every edge of the graph , together with a kirchhoff type interface condition at the central vertex and dirichlet boundary conditions at the outer vertices .",
    "to be precise , this is not quite true since the stretching forces might ( and for some graphs , depending on its angles , will have to ) be different for the individual edges .",
    "however , since there are no additional difficulties arising from this issue , we will assume that all our strings are stretched by a unit force for simplicity of notation .    via a usual separation of variables",
    "ansatz , one is led to the spectral problem @xmath11 on the whole graph @xmath10 . of course , it is not obvious at all how this differential equation has to be interpreted . roughly speaking",
    ", it has its usual meaning on each of the individual edges augmented by a kirchhoff type interface condition at the central vertex ( the precise notion will be given in section  [ s2 ] ) .",
    "our aim in this article is to solve the following inverse spectral problem : given the spectrum associated with   as well as all the spectra associated with the individual edges of the graph , we try to find the corresponding weight density @xmath4 on the graph @xmath10 . in the special case of stieltjes strings ,",
    "this problem has been solved quite recently in @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2 ) , where the solution can again be written down explicitly in terms of the spectral data .",
    "unsurprisingly , this solution turned out to be unique only if the spectra are assumed to be disjoint .    lacking uniqueness for this inverse spectral problem ,",
    "we are urged to introduce additional spectral quantities , which guarantee a unique solution . for the inverse three - spectra problem , this can be done by so - called coupling constants , relating the norms of eigenfunctions on the two subintervals . in the case of a general star graph",
    ", we need somewhat more elaborate spectral quantities , which relate the norms of eigenfunctions on the individual edges .",
    "this will lead us to the introduction of the so - called _ coupling matrices _ , containing precisely this information .",

    "the content of the present article can be outlined as follows : in section  [ s2 ] we will set up a precise notion of the differential equation   on a star graph @xmath10 , where @xmath4 is a non - negative borel measure on @xmath10 satisfying a particular growth condition near the outer vertices .",
    "consequently , we will introduce the associated self - adjoint linear relation in the sobolev space @xmath12 as well as those relations associated with the individual edges of the graph . in section  [ s3 ] , after deriving few necessary conditions for our spectral data , we will introduce the coupling matrices .",
    "the following section is then devoted to the statement and the proof of the main result of this article ; the solution of the aforementioned inverse spectral problem for our class of weight measures .",
    "concluding , we will show in section  [ s6 ] that it is always possible to approximate the solution of this inverse problem by stieltjes strings , which are obtained by cutting off the spectral data in a suitable way .",

    "* theorem  5.1 ) ) .",
    "in fact , in this case all of the sets @xmath108 are empty and hence no coupling matrices are present . however , certain parts of the weight measure may still be uniquely determined .",
    "for example , the weight @xmath161 in the central vertex is always uniquely determined by the spectra in view of  .",
    "also the measure @xmath42 on some edge @xmath21 is already uniquely determined under the weaker condition that @xmath130 and @xmath129 are disjoint .",
    "it is also possible to relate the growth of the weight measure @xmath89 near some outer vertex to the growth of the associated spectral quantities .",
    "more precisely , we are able to give a precise criteria for the weight measure to be finite near some outer vertex in terms of our spectral data . to this end , let @xmath89 be some weight measure , denote all corresponding quantities as usual and set @xmath178    [ corregcrit ] for every edge @xmath21 , the weight measure @xmath42 is finite near @xmath179 if and only if the sum @xmath180 is finite .",

    "hereby note that the residues of the function @xmath181 are uniquely determined by the spectra .",
    "therefore , the criterium in corollary  [ corregcrit ] is indeed formulated in terms of the given spectral quantities for our inverse spectral problem .",
    "as a final result , we are going to show that the solution of our inverse problem can be approximated by stieltjes strings @xcite , which are obtained by cutting off the given spectral data . to this end",
    ", we will first equip the space of weight measures @xmath40 with the initial topology with respect to the linear functionals @xmath182 on @xmath40 . note that this is the weak@xmath183 topology upon identifying @xmath40 with a ( weak@xmath183 closed ) subset of the dual of @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , each measure @xmath89 can be regarded as the bounded linear functional @xmath184 on @xmath31 . as a consequence ,",
    "the topology is metrizable on bounded ( with respect to the operator norm of the corresponding functionals ) subsets of @xmath40 and convergent sequences in @xmath40 are bounded . in order to state the following results , consider some sequence of measures @xmath185 , @xmath186 on the star graph @xmath10 .",

    "all quantities corresponding to the measures @xmath4 and @xmath188 , @xmath186 are denoted as in the preceding sections but with an additional subscript @xmath186 for those of @xmath188 .",
    "first of all , we will show that the operators @xmath191 converge to @xmath80 in the weak operator topology .",
    "indeed , proposition  [ propweakform ] shows that for @xmath72 one has @xmath192 at least for those functions @xmath54 with compact support .",

    ", we are now going to show that @xmath4 can be approximated by particular stieltjes strings .",
    "these approximating discrete weight measures are obtained by cutting off the spectral data corresponding to @xmath4 . to be precise",

    "it is readily verified that these spectral data satisfy the conditions of theorem  [ thmip ] and thus , the measures @xmath188 are well - defined .",
    "in fact , they are known to be supported on finite sets since their corresponding spectra are finite .",
    "moreover , the positions and weights of the individual point masses can be written down explicitly in terms of the spectral data .",
