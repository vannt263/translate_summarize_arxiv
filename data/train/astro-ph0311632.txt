    "over the past decade several studies on the physical characteristics of high redshift galaxies have revealed a number of new exciting results .",
    "in particular it has been established that the star formation rate ( sfr ) of both individual galaxies , as well as the sfr per co - moving volume , increases by more than an order of magnitude as we move from systems of the local universe to those found to a redshift of z@xmath32 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the details on exactly how the sfr evolves at even higher redshifts are still under debate as they are strongly affected by small number statistics on the properties of the population of the sources detected in sub - mm surveys , but more importantly by the accurate modeling of the effects of dust extinction . a number of deep surveys  most notably the hubble deep field",
    " have also shown that a large number of faint galaxies at intermediate and high redshift display irregular and/or disturbed morphology as well as an excess of blue light emission ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a way to explain this faint blue excess in the galaxy luminosity function is by introducing a rapidly evolving population of star forming galaxies at those redshifts @xcite .",
    "what are the properties though , of this population ?",
    "several researchers suggest that these distant galaxies are a new class of systems which are physically small in size @xcite , while others speculate that they are high redshift analogues of local interacting galaxies .",
    "the latter scenario can be understood since those distant galaxies may look peculiar because of the k - correction and band shifting of their short wavelength ( uv ) emission to the optical hst filters ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  and references therein ) .",
    "two additional independent findings seem to suggest that galaxy interactions may indeed have significant implications to the blue excess in the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the first one is the ample evidence that the galaxy interaction / merge rate increases as a power law function of redshift @xmath1(1+z)@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "even though a direct observational measure of the interacting / merging galaxy pairs , and hence @xmath5 , has been difficult due to a number of potential biases in surveys , current estimates indicate that @xmath5 can be as high as 34.5 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "*  for a review ) .",
    "the second is that phenomena associated with galaxy interactions such as the presence of starburst , infrared luminous , and ultraluminous ( lirgs / ulirgs ) galaxies detected with iras also increase with redshift(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "tidally triggered massive star formation in galaxies , which may eventually transform gas rich galaxies into their ultraluminous phase , will be responsible for increasing their rest frame uv flux and hence for the blue color excess of the galaxies detected in deep surveys .",
    "it is also the reason why large quantities ( @xmath110@xmath6m@xmath7 ) of molecular gas may be compressed over an area of few hundred pc around their nuclei @xcite eventually obscuring them behind large quantities of dust . as a result ,",
    "wavelength dependent extinction by dust grains distorts the morphology of interacting galaxies , limiting our ability to accurately probe their properties .",
    "a prime example of this phenomenon was displayed in the study of ngc4038/39 ( `` the antennae '' ) by @xcite .",
    "this system of interacting galaxies , located at distance of 20mpc is only moderately infrared luminous(81000@xmath0 m ) = 5.62@xmath810@xmath9d(mpc)@xmath10(13.48_f_@xmath11 + 5.16_f_@xmath12 + 2.58_f_@xmath13+_f_@xmath14)l@xmath15 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , h@xmath16=75kms@xmath17mpc@xmath17 , and q@xmath18=0.5 to facilitate comparison with earlier work . ] ( l@xmath19=4.9@xmath20l@xmath7 ) and still contains considerable quantities of molecular gas dispersed over a large area , which may become available for a more intense star formation event in the future @xcite . despite that ,",
    "half of the mid - ir flux of the system originates from the optically obscured overlap region between the two nuclei ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is thus reasonable to pose the following questions",
    ". how would the morphology of systems more ir luminous than ngc4038/39 be affected by the presence of dust and what consequences this may have in measurements of the _ spatially unresolved _ ir luminous galaxies which are readily discovered at high ( z@xmath21 ) redshift ?",
    "more specifically , how might this affect the conclusions of color correlations between a number of optical and near - ir surveys that are performed from the ground ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and those scheduled to be performed with the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we will base our analysis on high resolution uv and mid - ir observations of arp299 and vv114 that became recently available .",
    "both galaxies have ir luminosities almost an order of magnitude higher than ngc4038/39 ( l@xmath225@xmath23l@xmath15 for arp299 and @xmath14@xmath23l@xmath15 for vv114 ) but the projected spatial separation between their two interacting components is still sufficiently large ( 8 and 6kpc respectively ) for us to be able to resolve them given their proximity ( 41 and 80mpc respectively ) .",
    "all observations used in this paper were retrieved from previously published work and we refer the reader to those publications for details on the data reduction . the mid - ir data were obtained with isocam on board the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and were presented by @xcite for vv114 and by @xcite for arp299 .",
    "the uv data of both galaxies were retrieved from the hst archive .",
    "an analysis of the stis images of vv114 and foc images arp299 is included in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "a detailed study of the apparent morphology of peculiar galaxies as a function of redshift was already performed by @xcite by examining uv and optical images of a sample of 4 interacting galaxies .",
    "these authors found that at z@xmath21.5 it is no longer possible to discern features such as long tidal tails and bridges that would identify these systems as clearly `` interacting '' , even in exposures as deep as the hubble deep field .",
    "these authors also alluded that the redshifted rest uv light , which will be sampled in the optical if those galaxies are at z@xmath21.5 , can not be used to accurately image the evolved stellar population .",
    "the limitations discussed by @xcite become even stronger if one considers dust extinction , then a@xmath24@xmath17a@xmath25@xmath1270a@xmath26 @xcite . ] .",
    "even though numerous z@xmath123 galaxies have been detected as uv drop outs , the actual magnitude of extinction effects in the detection of distant galaxies using their rest frame uv emission is still under debate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "*  for conflicting views ) .",
    "however , a number of recent results clearly suggest the presence of considerable quantities of dust at high redshifts . based on a uv selected sample of 16 galaxies at 2@xmath27z@xmath272.6",
    ", @xcite found that the sfr , measured using the redshifted into the k - band h@xmath28 line , is not only elevated ( 16m@xmath7yr@xmath17 ) but it is also a factor of @xmath12.4 higher than that estimated using their uv continuum ( sfr@xmath29 ) .",
    "this discrepancy in estimating the sfr is even higher for the systems with low uv luminosity and can be easily understood due to the presence of dust .",
    "unfortunately no h@xmath30 line was detected from these galaxies to measure their balmer decrement , and consequently we can not be certain whether the factor of 2.4 is just a lower limit .",
    "furthermore , uv selected samples may be biased towards systems with a low dust content . a similar underestimate in sfr@xmath29 compared to the one calculated using the h@xmath30 line",
    "was found for a small sample of galaxies at z=3 by @xcite . even at lower redshifts though ( z@xmath11 ) , where larger samples and better statistics are available , the presence of dust is evident and new rather interesting trends emerge . in an analysis of a large sample of galaxies located at 0.4@xmath27z@xmath270.8",
    "@xcite estimated their sfr using the ir luminosity as well as their h@xmath28 emission .",
    "they found a clear trend indicating that as one moves from lower to higher luminosity systems ( l@xmath31@xmath32l@xmath7 ) the sfr@xmath33 is up to _ an order of magnitude less _ than the sfr@xmath19 ( see their fig .",
    "15 ) in agreement with the original work by @xcite based on iras data .",
    "the result of @xcite further supports our concern that the effects of dust in the z@xmath12 ir luminous systems mentioned earlier may not have been properly taken into account .",
    "it also stresses the need to better quantify the correlation between the rest frame mid - ir emission and the l@xmath34 of ir luminous galaxies @xcite , since a strong active galactic nucleus ( agn ) can also contribute to the mid - ir ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to better illustrate another aspect of the influence of dust in the morphology of an ir luminous galaxy , we decided to compare the uv and 7@xmath0 m images of arp299 and vv114 , the two nearest interacting pairs of galaxies with l@xmath35 , which at the same time are sufficiently extended in the sky ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "both systems show a clearly resolved eastern and western component . as they have been studied extensively in all wavelengths we had access to published high resolution uv images with hst , mid - ir images with keck @xcite , as well as our own deep mid - ir images obtained with isocam ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the selection of the rest frame @xmath10.2@xmath0 m ( uv ) and @xmath17@xmath0 m ( mid - ir ) bands was determined by the fact that at z@xmath12 these would be observed in r-/i - bands and at @xmath124@xmath0 m respectively .",
    "the ongoing noao deep wide - field survey @xcite is covering those optical bands and it is sufficiently sensitive to detect the rest frame uv emission from arp299 and vv114 ( see table 1 ) , as well as any l@xmath36 star - forming galaxy at z@xmath32 ( detection limits of @xmath126mag in r and i - bands ) .",
    "a number of deep mid - ir surveys have also been scheduled to be performed with the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) using the 24@xmath0 m imaging using the multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) @xcite .",
    "sirtf will readily detect @xmath110@xmath37l@xmath7 starburst and star forming galaxies at z=2 , since the rest frame 7.7@xmath0 m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) feature , which is very strong in starburst systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will move into the mips 24@xmath0 m band .    at a redshift z=2",
    ", though , one arcsecond on the sky , the typical resolution of ground imagery , corresponds to a projected distance of 8kpc .",
    "the spatial resolution of sirtf is even poorer ( @xmath16.9@xmath38 at 24@xmath0 m ) . as a result",
    ", systems similar to arp299 and vv114 will be unresolved in these surveys .    observing the two galaxies in fig .",
    "1 the striking difference between the uv and 7@xmath0 m emission is obvious . in arp299",
    "we note that @xmath120% of the uv emission originates from the eastern component ( ic694 ) and @xmath180% is associated with ngc3690 .",
    "however , at 7 and 15@xmath0 m ic694 becomes progressively more luminous relative to ngc3690 , contributing @xmath130% and @xmath170% of the flux respectively .",
    "ic694 eventually dominates the ir luminosity of arp299 , contributing twice as much to it than ngc3690 . as we can see by the displaced centroid between the mid - ir and uv emission , discussed in @xcite , all uv and optical emission detected from ic694 is probably due to surface star formation activity .",
    "the emission from the massive stars formed by the high density molecular gas in the nucleus of ic694 only becomes visible in the near - ir and mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "the situation in vv114 is even more extreme .",
    "although vv114e is 2.5 times brighter than vv114w in the mid - ir it is practically invisible in the uv !",
    "vv114e actually displays strong evidence that a considerable fraction of its mid - ir flux originates from an agn @xcite , which further enhances its mid - ir emission .",
    "the relative contribution of both galaxy components to the total emission of each system in the the uv and mid - ir is presented in table  1 .    in table 1",
    "we also include the 7@xmath0 m to uv flux density ratio , @xmath39 , for each galaxy , as well as the global value for each interacting pair .",
    "a scatter in those values is substantial .",
    "we observe that the highly extinct galaxy of the pair has an @xmath39 ratio which can be 1.7 to 24 times greater than the corresponding ratio of the whole arp299 or vv114 respectively ! furthermore , in both cases the extreme characteristics of the redder / eastern galaxy , which is actually responsible for the bulk of the l@xmath40 of the system , remain inconspicuous if we restrict our observations to the rest frame uv and optical observations .",
    "when considered as a single system the uv emission from the less obscured component dilutes the signature of warm dust emission .",
    "hence , if one is to use the @xmath39 reddening or even estimate the slope @xmath30 of the uv spectrum to establish a @xmath30 to l@xmath41 correlation as tracer of extinction and total dust content ( i.e. , * ? ?",
    "* ) in ir luminous systems , a systematic underestimate of the dust content will be introduced .",
    "this fact has serious implications when one tries to examine the colors of distant high redshift sources using deep surveys with low or moderate spatial resolution .",
    "all ir luminous galaxies are very likely interacting systems",
    ". a significant fraction of them , similarly to the two cases presented above , will remain as unresolved point sources . even though the actual value of the rest frame mid - ir to uv ratio depends on the details of the filters used to observe the high - z sources ( r , i , and/or mips24 ) , and they are beyond the scope of this letter ,",
    "one result is clear from this exercise .",
    "a simple diagnostic which correlates integrated rest frame uv with mid - ir or radio measurement is bound to introduce a systematic scatter not just due to the unknown quantities of dust at high - z , but principally due to the blending of the emission from the unresolved interacting components .",
    "depending on the stage of the interaction and the amount of spatially extended star formation activity , there will be cases ( such as vv114 ) where this scatter may be extreme",
    ". the situation will be even more complicated if an obscured agn is present since this will increase the 36@xmath0 m mid - ir emission but it will have minimal effects in the uv flux . to address these limitations , follow - up observations with deep near - ir sub - arcsec imaging using the hubble space telescope or high quality ground facilities will be necessary in order to reveal whether those systems are indeed substantially disturbed and help us understand their physical properties .",
    "an interesting question to address would be how important / numerous galaxies with properties similar to vv114 are at high - z .",
    "the fact that the extreme characteristics of vv114 were realized based on high resolution uv and mid - ir maps , which are available for only a handful of the nearby lirgs / ulirgs , makes such a prediction challenging .",
    "however , if we use the 1jy sample of @xcite as a guide , we find that @xmath110% of the systems have interacting pairs with similar spatial separation to vv114 and an r - k color of one galaxy in the system being more than 2 mags different than the other one .",
    "for vv114 this color difference is  3.5mag . even though lirgs and ulirgs are rare in the local universe contributing to less than 6% of the local infrared emission ( see * ?",
    "* ) , they are much more frequent at high - z .",
    "the isocam deep surveys clearly demonstrate that at z@xmath11 nearly @xmath165% of the peak and integrated cosmic infrared background originates from galaxies . of those galaxies , @xmath175%",
    "are lirgs and ulirgs ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , as we mentioned earlier , it is accepted that lirgs / ulirgs are the result of galaxy merging and it has been found that even though interacting systems comprise only 39% of all local galaxies @xcite , the merger rate increases rapidly with redshift ( 1+z)@xmath42 out to z@xmath13 @xcite and most high - z galaxies appear somewhat perturbed . based on the above",
    "results a simple scaling would suggest that systems such as vv114 may contribute @xmath1510% to the galaxy counts in the infrared at z@xmath31 .",
    "so even though extremely rare locally , systems such as vv114 may have profound effects in our understanding of the early universe .",
    "using archival images of vv114 and arp299 , two nearby violently interacting infrared luminous galaxies , we show the strikingly different morphology between their 0.2@xmath0 m uv and 7@xmath0 m mid - ir emission . even though the redshifted rest frame emission from both wavelengths will be easily detected at z@xmath12 by ground based r-/i - band surveys and by the 24@xmath0 m surveys of sirtf respectively",
    ", the fact that we will not be able to spatially resolve the different components of each source will introduce a scatter in their measured colors .",
    "this scatter will not only depend on the relative contribution of each interacting component to the total ir luminosity , but it will also cause a systematic underestimate of the integrated rest frame mid - ir to uv colors leading to lower values of the total dust content of those systems .",
