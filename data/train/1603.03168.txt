    "it is of great importance in astrophysics to understand the outcomes of mutual collisions between submicrometer - sized silicate grains as well as agglomerates of them at relative velocities of @xmath1@xmath2 . in their pioneering work , @xcite presented collision experiments in which amorphous silica spheres ( monospher@xmath3 , merck ) of radius @xmath4 stuck to an amorphous silica target unless the collision velocity exceeded 1.1@xmath5 .",
    "however , this threshold velocity is one order of magnitude higher than the critical velocity for the sticking of the spheres that was expected from a theoretical consideration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite experimentally demonstrated that the energy necessary for breaking an existing contact between amorphous silica spheres is underestimated in the theoretical arguments ( see * ? ? ? * for more experimental works ) .",
    "the theoretical estimates rely on the contact mechanics , in particular the so - called jkr theory of adhesive contact of @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the erosion rates of agglomerates consisting of nonporous amorphous silica spheres ( sicastar@xmath3 , micromod partikeltechnologie gmbh ) with a radius of @xmath6 using collisions of the same silica spheres .",
    "owing to the discrepancy between experiments and models for the sticking of amorphous silica spheres , the measured erosion rates are much smaller than expected by theoretical models . as a result",
    ", a modification of the jkr theory involving introducing additional energy dissipation has been a common practice for compensating for the discrepancy @xcite .",
    "it is most unfortunate that the majority of recent models tend to do nothing more than to focus on how to tune the energy dissipation in the models to experimental results on collisions .",
    "according to the jkr theory , the critical velocity for the sticking of spherical particles is proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the surface energy of the particles @xcite . following an experimental work by @xcite or @xcite ,",
    "the surface energy of hydrophilic amorphous silica is commonly assumed to be @xmath9@xmath10 in the previous models @xcite .",
    "these values for amorphous silica are smaller than those for h@xmath11o ice , while substances with high melting temperatures have long been well - known to have high surface energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the surface chemistry of the particles , and hence their circumstances , play an important role in the determination of the surface energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , it has been suggested that the surface energy of silica glass measured in a vacuum is one order of magnitude higher than that under ambient conditions @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite presented their results on the surface energy under ambient conditions , while @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite performed their collision experiments in a vacuum .",
    "the surfaces of hydrophilic amorphous silica are occupied by silanol ( si  oh ) groups with at most a single monolayer of adsorbed h@xmath11o molecules ( @xmath12 ) in a vacuum @xcite . in contrast , hydrophilic amorphous silica surfaces under ambient conditions are found to swell by 12  nm , which reflect multiple layers of adsorbed h@xmath11o molecules ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , when evaluating the value of @xmath8 that is appropriate for mutual collisions of amorphous silica grains , one has to properly take into account the surface chemistry of interfering grain surfaces .    on the one hand ,",
    "the hydrogen - bonded linkage at the outermost layer of adsorbed water is the main contributor for the surface energy measured by @xcite and @xcite at the equilibrium elastic displacements expected in the jkr theory .",
    "on the other hand , hydrogen bonding between silanol groups may contribute to the cohesive force on hydrophilic silicate grains upon collision in a vacuum . because hydrogen bonding between silanol groups is stronger than hydrogen bonding between water molecules , it is likely that the previous models underestimated the surface energy for amorphous silica in collision experiments .",
    "consequently , we may not need additional energy dissipation to describe collision experiments in the framework of the jkr theory if we pay great attention as to which value of @xmath8 is more appropriate for collision experiments .",
    "the surface energy @xmath8 is the most important parameter for modeling mutual collisions between silicate grains , though its determination is not trivial .",
    "first , we shall review a possible range of surface energies determined for amorphous silica surfaces under different conditions and techniques . by summarizing the available data on the surface energies",

    "@xcite found values as small as @xmath22 for the highest tms density of @xmath23 , while the value increases with relative humidities .",
