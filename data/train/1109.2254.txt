    "except for a finite list of interesting exceptions , richard roth @xcite classified isonemal periodic prefabric designs into 39 infinite species .",
    "coarser than the five previously defined genera @xcite are three more general and easily described classes .",
    "species 110 have reflection or glide - reflection symmetries with parallel axes and no rotational symmetry , not even half - turns .",
    "species 1132 have reflection or glide - reflection symmetries with perpendicular axes , hence half - turns , but no quarter - turns .",
    "species 3339 have quarter - turn symmetries but no mirror or glide - reflection symmetries .",
    "this taxonomy has been refined slightly and used in @xcite , to which reference needs to be made , to determine the feasible symmetry groups and hence isonemal prefabrics . as roth observes beginning his subsequent paper @xcite on perfect colourings , ` [ r]ecent mathematical work on the theory of woven fabrics ' begins with @xcite , which remains the fundamental reference . in @xcite roth determines which fabrics  actually prefabrics  can be perfectly coloured by striping warp and weft . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "to which reference also needs to be made , i reconsider thin striping in terms of roth s taxonomy as refined in @xcite and consider further the related question of which isonemal prefabrics of even genus fall apart . here",
    "i pursue the topic of thick striping and questions about isonemal prefabrics of genus v that fall apart . striping",
    "is partly explained in section 2 . in section 3",
    "designs of species 1132 are considered and in section 4 those of species 3339 . in section 5 the extension to order 20 begun in @xcite of the catalogue @xcite of isonemal prefabrics that fall apart is completed .",
    "section 6 considers the two - colouring of woven cubes .",
    "we turn now to the matter of perfect colourings of the strands of a prefabric with two colours , the subject of @xcite , roth s later weaving paper @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "if all of the symmetries of a prefabric with coloured strands are colour symmetries , then the choice of the strand colours is said to be _ perfect _ ( or _ symmetric _ ) .",
    "there are only two ways to colour a prefabric that can result in perfect colouring other than the _ normal _ ( dark warps , pale wefts ) .",
    "warps and wefts can be striped , that is be pale and dark , either _ thinly _ , that is alternately , or _",
    "thickly _ , that is alternating in pairs : pale , pale , dark , dark , pale , pale . adapting a device from @xcite , the colouring of a prefabric can be represented by seeming to extend strands outside the pattern to indicate which strands are pale or dark .",
    "i adopt this convention as long as it is not completely obvious which strands are which ( figures 1 , 2 , and 13 ) .",
    "striping warp and weft creates a checkerboard of cells that may be called redundant and irredundant , where the _ redundant _ are those where the same colour meets itself and the _ irredundant _ are those where the pattern colour is determined by the design . in this language ,",
    "the irredundant cells on the obverse have the complement of the design in predominantly dark rows and the colour of the design in predominantly pale rows , in both cases the reverse has the complementary colour .",
    "10 pt    ( a)54 pt ( b)42 pt ( c )    10 pt    ( a)54 pt ( b)42 pt ( c )    consider the effect of striping the warp and weft of plain weave thickly . the checkerboards of redundant cells in both of the distinct stripings of figures 1 and 2 are that of plain weave doubled ( box weave 4 - 3 - 1 ) . the resulting pattern in both cases is the simplest houndstooth 4 - 1 - 2 * , a prefabric that falls apart if coloured normally but , as is illustrated here , is weavable as a fabric with striped strands .",
    "this striping illustrates that the patterns obtained by striping warp and weft of isonemal fabrics are the designs of prefabrics that fall apart ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3 ) . in consequence of this fact together with the known conditions for isonemal fabrics that fall apart ( @xcite , @xcite ) ,",
    "if the pattern of a fabric obtained by striping warp and weft is the design of an isonemal prefabric , then the prefabric is of genus ii , iv , or v with no overlap with genus i or iii and with one quarter of the cells in half the rows dark .",
    "the pattern arising from the striping of warp and weft of an isonemal fabric does not need to _ be _ the design of an isonemal prefabric @xcite .",
    "if there is to be any hope of perfect colouring , then the colouring , striping , must be chosen so that the colour symmetries of the fabrics map redundant cells to redundant cells and irredundant cells to irredundant cells , or as roth puts it ` preserve ' them .",
    "which half of the cells are to be redundant and which half are to be irredundant is a choice to be made .",
    "there are therefore two ways to stripe the same fabric thinly and two thickly , taking reversal of colours not to be a different striping . preserving the two classes of cell rules out as symmetries , for any striping , glide - reflections with axes not in mirror position , translations @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 not integers of the same parity , and half - turns with centres not at the centre or corner of a cell but not half - turns with centres in those two positions , not other translations and not mirror symmetries .",
    "it rules out , for thin striping , quarter - turns with centres not at the centre of a cell .",
    "it rules out , for thick striping , translations @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 odd or with @xmath3 not divisible by 4 .",
    "the two theorems on what can be thinly striped , essentially proved by roth , although not stated in terms of his taxonomy , are ( from @xcite ) as follows .",
    "isonemal periodic prefabrics of order greater than @xmath4 and of every species with symmetry axes that is not ruled out by the placement of glide - reflections can be perfectly coloured by thin striping : @xmath5 , @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 , and @xmath9@xmath10    isonemal periodic prefabrics of order greater than @xmath4 with quarter - turn symmetry can be perfectly coloured by thin striping if and only if they are of species @xmath11 .    for thick striping",
    ", the translation constraint eliminates as candidates all twills and twillins ( genera i and ii ) , having as symmetries , as they do , translations from strand to adjacent strand ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) , taking with them species 110 , 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 23 , 24 , 26 , 28 , 31 , and 32 from the first 32 species .",
    "order , being the minimal @xmath14 such that @xmath15 is a translation , must be divisible by 4 eliminating , in addition to those already forbidden , only species @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , for thick striping , quarter - turn centres must be at cell corners and fall in the centre of blocks of four cells ( redundant or irredundant ) , and half - turn centres must also be at cell corners but can fall in the centre or at the corners of blocks of four cells ( redundant or irredundant ) .",
    "roth has shown @xcite that these modest necessary conditions are also sufficient to allow the two sorts of striping .",
    "to use thick striping to produce perfect colouring , symmetry groups with glide - reflections must have axes in mirror position , translations @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 even and with @xmath3 divisible by 4 , any quarter - turn centres at cell corners that fall in the centre of blocks of four redundant or irredundant cells , and half - turn centres at cell corners that fall in the centre or at the corners of blocks of four redundant cells .",
    "as mentioned , these constraints eliminate species 110 and 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 , 23 , 24 , 26 , @xmath16 , 28 , 31 , and 32 from those with perpendicular axes .",
    "half - turns with centres not at cell corners are ruled out , and those at cell corners have to be spaced to fall at the centre or corner of the blocks of four redundant and irredundant cells .",
    "a mirror must pass alternately through centres and corners of such blocks .",
    "other mirror positions are ruled out , again a matter of spacing . finally , glide - reflections are ruled out unless they lie in the position just described for mirrors , and their glides must be an even multiple of @xmath17 in order to preserve the doubled checkerboard of blocks of redundant cells .",
    "we need to examine species 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 25 , @xmath18 , 29 , and 30 to see which might produce perfect colouring by having strands striped thickly .",
    "roth points out that when @xmath19 is of type @xmath20 , the edges of its lattice unit must be allowable translations , that is with components divisible by 4 .",
    "but from @xcite they are @xmath21 and @xmath22 with @xmath23 and so can not be divisible by 4 .",
    "this rules out the species from 11 to 16 .",
    "the group type @xmath24 is not so restrictive .",
    "if the quarter @xmath19 lattice unit is odd by odd in @xmath17 units , then the lattice - unit edges are not allowable translations , but if it is odd by even and the even direction is perpendicular to the mirrors , that is , it is the distance between the mirrors , then double the glide will be the necessary multiple of @xmath17 divisible by 4 .",
    "this bans species species @xmath25 and @xmath26 but allows @xmath27 and @xmath28 , provided parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 are used only the right way around and not with the other orientation .",
    "the positive possibility is illustrated by 8 - 19 - 7 ( roth s @xmath27 example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 9a ) ) and the negative by 8 - 19 - 4 ( @xmath28 example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 9c ) ) , which has mirrors @xmath17 apart .",
    "satisfaction of the same restriction is forced on all designs of species 21 , for example 8 - 7 - 2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 10 ) .",
    "species 22 , on the other hand , is forced to violate the restriction , the distance between mirrors being always odd in @xmath17 .",
    "that concludes the groups of type @xmath24 , allowing @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and 21 .",
    "the only species of crystallographic type @xmath31 that might work is 25 .",
    "all such designs have translations ( edges of the lattice unit ) of even length in @xmath17 because of the standard isonemal spacing of the quarter lattice unit .",
    "accordingly all such fabrics can be thickly striped , which is not to say that every thick striping is a perfect colouring .",
    "the striping has to be done to be compatible with the location of the @xmath32 - 0.3 pt s -3pt .",
    "the remaining possibilities are of crystallographic type @xmath33 . as for thin striping",
    ", stripability depends on the translations @xmath34 and @xmath35 , that are the sides of the rhombic lattice unit . whereas for thin striping their components needed just the same parity , for thick stiping they must be even and @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the length and width of the rhombs in @xmath17 units , must be divisible by 4 .",
    "so only the even - even spacing of species @xmath18 ( example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 12b ) ) , also used in species 29 ( roth example 16 - 2499 ( * ? ? ? * figure 6 ) = ( * ? ? ? * figure 15a ) ) , is acceptable .",
    "these facts can be summarized in a theorem containing no information not in @xcite , but @xcite is not written in terms of roth s symmetry - group types .",
    "the species of isonemal prefabrics that can be perfectly coloured by thick striping of warp and weft are both @xmath27 and @xmath28 provided that the distance between neighbouring mirrors is even in @xmath17 units , @xmath38 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the species that allow thick striping are a proper subset of those that allow thin striping ( cf .",
    "theorem 2.1 ) .",
    "isonemal prefabrics that can be perfectly coloured by thick striping of warp and weft have orders divisible by eight .",
    "this corollary is a direct consequence of the constraints on orders of the species @xcite mentioned in the theorem .",
    "in fact , prefabrics of species @xmath18 and @xmath9 have orders divisible by 16 .",
    "more interesting and less obvious is the correspondence between prefabrics of the species that allow thick striping , @xmath27 , 21 , 25 , @xmath18 , and 29 , and some prefabrics of the species @xmath39 , 23 , 26 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and 31 , which are the only species that can both be doubled and remain isonemal ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4 ) and be perfectly coloured by thin striping ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1 ) .",
    "such prefabrics can be doubled because they have centres of half turns on their mid - lines . when they are doubled they become @xmath27 , 21 , 25 , @xmath18 , and 29 respectively .",
    "when one is striped thinly _ and _ doubled , what results is a thick striping . since the existence of some prefabrics that can be thickly striped shows that the types they fall in can be thickly striped , we have an interesting direct way to see this list . but",
    "@xmath28 is missing from the list .",
    "it would be the result of ` doubling ' a non - existent stripable species @xmath42 with the spacing of @xmath39 but with @xmath43 on mid - lines of strands where they are impossible ( as was mentioned when species 19 and 20 were discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "after the ` doubling ' , when @xmath43 _ can _ be at the cell - corner position formerly the centre of a cell , we have fabrics of type @xmath28 .    in view of the non - existence of a species @xmath42",
    ", one can wonder whether fabrics of species @xmath28 really can be thickly striped , but fabric 8 - 11 - 4 of species @xmath28 becomes 8 - 5 - 3 * when thickly striped .    when fabrics are thinly striped , there is a marked tendency to stripiness of the patterns produced , so strong a tendency that designs of isonemal prefabrics are the exception rather than the rule . since the only species with perpendicular axes that we know will produce an isonemal design when striped thinly are 11 , 22 , and 30 , we have reason to expect non - isonemal designs to be produced by thick striping , especially as so many thick stripings are doubled thin stripings , and that expectation is not disappointed .",
    "prefabrics of species @xmath27 , 25 , and @xmath18 have @xmath44 of crystallographic type @xmath45 with no warp - to - weft transformation",
    ". one can expect such patterns to have stripes .",
    "examples show that prefabrics of the other types , @xmath28 , 21 , and 29 , when thickly striped can fail to be designs of isonemal prefabrics because the pairs of strands of the same colour can not be interchanged or because the pale and dark pairs of parallel strands can not be interchanged although there are warp - to - weft transformations .",
    "these examples show that there can be no theorem like theorem 3 of @xcite assuring us that whole species of fabrics with perpendicular axes produce designs of isonemal prefabrics when thickly striped .",
    "we can say the following .",
    "the design of an isonemal prefabric of order greater than @xmath4 and of pure genus v , which includes all those that look thickly striped , is of species @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "these species were determined by roth @xcite to be the only non - exceptional prefabrics of pure genus v.    if an isonemal fabric perfectly coloured by thick striping is the design of an isonemal prefabric , then the prefabric is of species @xmath48 , or @xmath47 .    because of the alternation in pairs of rows 3/4 dark and 3/4 pale , such a prefabric must be of genus v and no other",
    "the order of the design of an isonemal prefabric with symmetry axes , of order greater than @xmath4 , and of genus v is a multiple of @xmath49 .",
    "orders of species 21 and 29 are divisible by 8 and 16 respectively @xcite .",
    "corollary 3.5 accounts for the known lack of such prefabrics of order 12 and guarantees such a lack at order 20 .",
    "prefabrics of species 37 with quarter - turn symmetry _",
    "can _ have order divisible by 4 @xcite ; we return to species 37 in the next section .",
    "prefabrics of species 21 and 29 have nothing to contribute to the extension to order 20 @xcite of the catalogue of prefabrics that fall apart @xcite .    it can be noted that 4 - 1 - 1 * , the only isonemal prefabric of order 4 that falls apart and whose design is produced by thin striping , is of species @xmath50 . it can be doubled to produce 8 - 3 - 1 * of species 21 , and the only other thickly striped prefabric of order 8 , 8 - 9 - 1 * is a variation of 8 - 3 - 1 * in the same species . similarly",
    "8 - 5 - 1 * of species",
    "@xmath51 doubles to 16 - 51 - 1 * of species 21 . variations of 16 - 51 - 1 * in its order and species are 153 - 1 * , 291 - 1 * , 291 - 2 * , 531 - 2 * , 531 - 3 * , and 2193 - 1*. likewise , 8 - 5 - 3 * of species 31 doubles to 16 - 51 - 2 * of species 29 , which has variations there 153 - 2 * , 291 - 3 * , 291 - 4 * , 531 - 1 * , 531 - 4 * , 561 - 1 * and 2193 - 2*. only the two prefabrics 16 - 51 - 1 * and 16 - 51 - 2 * can be produced directly by doubling .",
    "the above prefabric designs can all be produced by thickly striping isonemal fabrics .",
    "this is not , however , generally possible .",
    "the key fact that allows",
    "this to be seen is that all of the species with symmetry axes that allow thick striping determined in theorem 3.3 have mirror symmetry .",
    "consider the isonemal prefabric of order 32 and species 21 that falls apart and is illustrated in figure 3a , a variation of 16 - 85 - 1 * doubled .",
    "10 pt     ( a)2.1 in ( b )    if one wants to go from this prefabric that falls apart to the design of a fabric that could be coloured by thick striping to look like it , one will have to reverse the colours of the irredundant cells in the predominantly dark rows and not those in the predominantly pale rows so that the striping would give the starting design .",
    "but when this is done with the prefabric of figure 3a , the partial design that results , shown in figure 3b , has nowhere that a mirror would fit among the irredundant cells determined , no matter what was done with the formerly redundant cells .",
    "the situation is quite different in the next section .",
    "for thick strand striping to produce perfect colouring of prefabrics with quarter - turn symmetry , the components of the sides of the lattice units of level @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , must both be even and @xmath55 divisible by four .",

    "these centres of quarter - turns form two lattices , one of lattice - unit corners , the other of lattice - unit centres in what i have called chain - mail relation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 5b ) or ( * ? ? ? * figure 1d ) ) .",
    "the logical possibilities are shown in table 1 . because the movement from the corner of a level - four lattice to its centre is twice an even number of cell widths in one vertical or horizontal direction and then twice an odd number of cell widths in a perpendicular direction , @xmath60 , the two lattices of centre types specified in table 1 fall one in the centres of redundant blocks and the other in the centres of irredundant blocks . because half the lattice - unit side is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with odd other sides , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the half - turns with centres at mid - side fall at the corner rather than at the centre of a block of redundant cells ; this fact is needed for the proof of theorem 4.1 . in lines 1 and 2 of table 1 giving species @xmath58 and @xmath59 , it does not matter which lattice is which , but for species 37 , given by lines 3 and 4 , the results in general differ .",

    "figure 7 illustrates that the phenomenon of the disappearing pattern ( cf .",

    "this section illustrates that the thick striping of strands is relevant to what i call the perfect colouring of woven cubes .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that lattice units of an isonemal prefabric of order greater than 4 could be the regions of the net of an isonemal woven cube if and only if the prefabric is of species 33 , 34 , 37 , 38 , or 39 .",
    "woven cubes were introduced into the weaving literature by jean pedersen ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the focus in @xcite is on the isonemality of the ( essentially colourless ) weaving , not on what such a cube would look like . in @xcite the normal colouring of prefabric designs",
    "was used in the usual way to represent nets of cubes , but it makes no sense to think of a cube s being woven from ` normally ' coloured strands since the very idea of warp and weft as distinct strands makes no sense in the context . in shephard s simplest case with oblique lattice units (",
    "* figure 17 ) and so having faces of area 5 , each of the 6 strands required to weave the cube makes an appearance on all 6 faces ; even there separation into warps and wefts makes no sense . in examples",
    "even slightly larger , strands cross _ themselves _ ( in the cube of figures 14 and 15 , each of the 8 strands crosses itself 3 times ) . while it may be possible to colour strands other than by striping warp and weft in the net of the cube , that is the simplest thing to try , and it can work .",
    "the definition of isonemal woven cube used in @xcite requires not only that the six faces be woven in the same way such that the rotations of the cube around its 4-fold , 3-fold , and 2-fold axes be collectively transitive on the strands but also that there be no centres of symmetry in the net of the cube other than the quarter - turns at the centres and corners of faces and the half - turns at the middle of their sides .",
    "obviously it is possible to weave cubes from prefabrics with more symmetries than can be given by the rotations of the whole cube ( e.g. , plain weave in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 17 ) ) .",
    "pedersen expressed reservations about applying reflection in the plane of the fabric to operations on the net of the cube , but in ( * ? ? ? * figure 17 ) and @xcite those reservations were ignored . in this paper , however , we have found that the presence of quarter - turns requiring @xmath66 leads to appearances of obverse and reverse with contrasting stripes so related . as a result , while it is possible to colour perfectly fabrics of species @xmath11 thinly and @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and 37 thickly , we know that the results in the cases of @xmath11 and @xmath59 do not look symmetrical , and they are also not ways of weaving a cube .",
    "* lemma 10 ) shows that the isonemality of a woven cube requires that there be no @xmath65 in the net at face corners .",
    "that means that , if a species-37 prefabric is to be used to weave a cube , the net of the cube has corners at the @xmath64 of figures 8a and 9a rather than being composed of lattice units marked in those figures , putting @xmath65 in the block ( irredundant in figure 8a , redundant in figure 9a ) in the centre of every face .",
    "note that the colouring convention does not operate in these figures ; they are patterns not designs .",
    "each face accordingly has a stripe across it ; its quarter - turn symmetry is not a colour symmetry .",
    "moreover , in figure 9a , where the face - centre blocks are redundant , the four cells surrounding the corner @xmath64 are differently coloured , two dark and two pale , so that the net must include two of one colour and one of the other , destroying in the cube the perfect symmetry in the plane .    in contrast , thick striping of species @xmath58 can be used to colour cubes provided only that the centres of redundant blocks are used as the corners of the cube , putting @xmath64 in the centre of irredundant blocks in the centre of faces .",
    "these faces therefore look like the lattice units illustrated in figures 6 and 1012 .",
    "all the faces look the same .",
    "a _ perfectly coloured isonemal woven cube _ is a cube woven isonemally @xcite with its strands so coloured that each rotational symmetry of the cube preserves or permutes the colours showing in the cells .",
    "lattice units of a fabric of species @xmath58 , perfectly coloured by thick striping , compose the net of a perfectly coloured isonemal woven cube provided that the corners of the lattice units fall at the centres of redundant blocks of the striping .",
    "we know that thick striping must have centres of redundant blocks at either corners or centres of lattice units .",
    "for the lattice units to compose the net of a perfectly coloured cube , the centres of redundant blocks must be placed at corners so that , of the four cells in a block , the three that fall in the net have the same colour ; if a corner block were irredundant , containing as it does a centre of quarter - turn , two of its cells would be dark and two pale . we know that the thick striping specified is a perfect colouring of the planar fabric and that the weaving makes an isonemal cube .",
    "what needs to be shown is that the rotations of the cube permute or preserve the colours showing in the cells .",
    "the quarter - turns at the centres of the faces obviously reverse the colours because the centre blocks are irredundant and woven accordingly so that quarter - turns reversed colours in the plane . the half - turns at the middle of edges obviously reverse the colours because they do so in the plane , lying as they do on the strand boundary between thick stripes predominantly dark and predominantly pale .",
    "the rotations whose working is not obvious are the quarter - turns at the corners of the lattice units .",
    "they are quarter - turns without @xmath66 in order to make the weaving isonemal , but their blocks are made redundant in order to make their effect look like quarter - turns with @xmath66 in standardly coloured design diagrams , i.e. , not to reverse colours . because colours are preserved in the quarter - turn at a lattice - unit corner that is a vertex @xmath67 of the cube , predominantly dark pairs of strands are rotated to predominantly dark pairs of strands and likewise pale _ in the plane_. in all four directions , predominantly dark pairs of strands are the same distances from @xmath67 , likewise pale pairs . in the net , where one of the four lattice units surrounding @xmath67 is removed , when the formerly planar strands are joined up along lattice - unit boundaries to make a new vertex @xmath68 of the cube and the edge @xmath69",
    ", predominantly dark pairs match with predominantly dark pairs and likewise pale because they are the same distance from @xmath67 .",
    "the result of the joining along @xmath69 looks exactly the same as the result of mere folding along the other edges , say , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the centre of colour - preserving 4-fold rotation at @xmath67 in the plane now lies on an axis of colour - preserving 3-fold rotation of the cube in space .",
    "@xmath68 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 fall at the centres of redundant blocks coloured complementary to @xmath67 s block because the edge lengths arrange it so .",
    "perfect colouring of the cube is the case .    the 4-sided picture - frame - like motifs of 4147 - 2 * ( figure 6b ) , 2329 - 1 * , 2 * , 4147 - 1 * , and 4249 - 2 * ( in figure 10 ) , 8367 - 2 * ( figure 11h  also 14 and 15 ) , and a number of others , which surround such centres as @xmath67 of the theorem become 3-sided in the cube , which looks odd ( escher - like ) in two - dimensional representations since they are still composed of square cells .",
    "figures 14 and 15 illustrate the thick striping catalogued as 20 - 8367 - 2 * used as the net of a cube .",
    "to have a fabric to stripe , it is necessary to choose one of the ways to weave a species-@xmath58 fabric by reversing the colouring algorithm and fixing the weaving of the redundant blocks compatibly with the symmetry group .",
    "this was done in figure 13 .",
    "the lattice unit marked in figures 11h and 13 becomes the top surface of the cube in figure 14 .",
    "figure 14 shows three faces of the cube with a picture - frame motif around a vertex at the front in what is left of a pale redundant block inside the picture frame . because the vertex at the intersection of the three hidden faces is a dark vertex ,",
    "the faces look like the colour - complement of figure 14 upside down . for the same reason that reverses of fabrics",
    "are shown reflected , namely the matching of corresponding cells , figure 15 illustrates the hidden faces reflected in a mirror .",
    "reflection has the effect that the cell boundaries around the edges of figures 14 and 15 match , allowing one to follow a strand off the edge of the illustration in either figure to where it continues ( within the same cell ) in the other figure .",
    "for example , the dark strand that can be seen at the bottom front corner of figure 14 proceeding upward and to the right , is hidden for a cell then exposed for a cell , then passes through a dark redundant block before being hidden for one cell and reaching an exposed cell that overlaps the edge of the cube .",
    "it can be seen again , as the third strand up the right vertical edge in figure 15 , to proceed up and to the left through another redundant block , exposed for 1 cell , hidden for 1 , through 2 redundant blocks and exposed in the 2 cells between them as it passes across the central vertical edge , and then hidden for 2 cells before reaching the upper left vertex as a cell in a redundant block mainly invisible in figure 15 .",
    "the strand is transferred to figure 14 with the second ( larger ) part of that cell in the larger part of the same redundant block and a small part of the next cell on the top face coming forward before descending the lower left face . in this way it is possible to follow the whole course of the strand  or any strand  as it makes its way twice in perpendicular directions across each face .",
    "one sees that the strand is 60 cells long ( 3 times its 1-dimensional period ) , that there are 4 dark and 4 pale strands , their 480 cells being a double covering of the 240 cells of the cube .",
    "work on this material has been done at home and at wolfson college , oxford .",
    "richard roth helped with the understanding of his papers .",
    "will gibson made it possible for me to draw the diagrams with surprising ease from exclusively keyboard input .",
