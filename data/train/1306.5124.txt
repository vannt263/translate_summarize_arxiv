    "in the phase diagram of high temperature superconducting copper oxides , various anomalous electronic properties have been reported in addition to the occurrence of unconventional _ d - wave _ superconductivity . in normal state , these materials exhibit non - fermi liquid properties and enter a mysterious pseudo - gap regime , characterized by the loss of density of states on certain portions of the fermi surface below a temperature @xmath4 . a large variety of theoretical models has been designed to account for these exotic electronic properties and to shed light on their interplay with non conventional superconductivity . among them , the pseudo - gap theory of c. m. varma @xcite proposes that the pseudo - gap state is a long range ordered state and that fluctuations of its order parameter control not only the non fermi liquid properties , but also are likely to mediate the _ d - wave _ superconducting pairing @xcite .",
    "derived from the 3-band hubbard model , this mean - field theory postulated that strong electronic interaction involving the coulomb repulsion between copper and neighboring planar oxygens give rise to the spontaneous appearance of circulating current ( cc ) loops within @xmath0 unit cell .",
    "the cc - loops appear by pairs , turning clockwise and anti - clockwise .",
    "this intra - unit - cell ( iuc ) order breaks time reversal symmetry , but preserves lattice translation invariance . beyond the mean - field theory proposed by c. m. varma , the existence of a cc - loop order",
    "is challenged by other theoretical studies . the numerical analysis carried by thomale and greiter @xcite",
    "does not confirm their existence .",
    "the quantum variational monte carlo simulation of weber and co - workers @xcite questions the stability of the cc - loops suggested by varma s model , but suggests that a cc - loop order could become much more stable in a 5-band hubbard model , where apical oxygen orbitals are also included . in addition , the existence of cc - loops in ladder copper oxide materials is not fully excluded @xcite . beyond pure theoretical considerations ,",
    "several experimental observations provide strong encouragement for models based cc - loop order in copper oxide materials .",
    "polarized neutron scattering studies carried in bilayer @xmath2 ( y123 ) @xcite and monolayer @xmath1 ( hg1201 ) @xcite have reported experimental evidence of a long range 3d magnetic order hidden in the pseudo - gap state .",
    "the existence of such a long range ordered magnetic state has been confirmed recently in bilayer @xmath5 ( bi2212 ) @xcite . in monolayer @xmath6 ( la214 ) ,",
    "a similar magnetic order has also been observed @xcite , but in this system it remains 2d and short ranged .",

    "the fact that @xmath4 does not decrease linearly with increasing hole doping and likely diplays a shoulder around optimal doping in bi2212 @xcite is well reproduced by the hole doping dependence of @xmath7 ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the comparison of the polarized neutron scattering measurements and tunneling spectroscopy measurements in bi2212 @xcite suggest that the variation of the ordered magnetic moment upon increasing hole doping seems to reproduce the one of the pseudo - gap energy @xmath15 .",
    "this novel 3d magnetic order does not seem to depend strongly on the structural properties of the materials .",
    "in contrast with y123 or hg1201 , bi2212 has a body centered structure .",
    "the magnetic order seems to remain 3d independently from the nature of the stacking of cu sites along the @xmath16 axis .",
    "furthermore , hg1201 is a tetragonal system , y123 is orthorhombic along the cu - o bonds and bi2212 is orthorhombic along diagonals .",
    "the influence of orthorhombicity on details of the magnetic structure is a relevant issue , but dedicated neutron scattering studies are still under progress .",

    "the possible detection of these magnetic fields by local probes such as nmr , nqr or @xmath18sr is still debated @xcite , but should help to get a deeper understanding of the intrinsic nature of the iuc magnetic order .    beyond polarized neutron scattering experiments , other measurements carried out in y123 provide direct or indirect indications that a symmetry breaking state develops below the pseudo - gap temperature .",
    "indeed , resonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurements have recently reported the first thermodynamic evidence of a true phase transition taking place when entering the pseudo - gap @xcite .",
    "in addition , the observation of anomalies in the second derivative of the magnetization below @xmath19 @xcite can be understood in term of a coupling of the cc - loop order parameter to the uniform susceptibility @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spontaneous appearance of an a - b anisotropy in the nernst coefficient at @xmath20 @xcite could be interpreted as a violation of the onsager reciprocity principle in the cc - loop state which breaks time reversal symmetry @xcite .",
    "finally , a polar kerr effect has been observed within the pseudo - gap state below @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this effect has been initially interpreted as a signature of a time reversal symmetry broken state @xcite , but actually ascribed to a gyrotopic order @xcite . as shown in fig.[fig3 ] ,",
    "the hole doping dependencies of the different temperatures @xmath7 , @xmath19 , @xmath22 and @xmath20 display a certain similarity , suggesting that the related phenomena could share a common origin .    while the appearance of an iuc magnetic order can be ascribed to cc - loops , to date",
    "there is no direct observation of these cc - loops in superconducting cuprates . alternatively , a resonant x - ray diffraction study in non superconducting cuo has claimed the first direct observation of cc - loops in @xmath0 unit cell , i.e the basic building block of superconducting copper oxide materials @xcite , but has been challenged theoretically @xcite .",

    "@xcite have been first presented as a direct evidence for time reversal symmetry breaking within the pseudo - gap state .",
    "this interpretation is now challenged by the fact the sign of the rotation of the polarization angle is the same on opposite surfaces of the sample , while in the usual kerr effect the rotation angle must reverse .",

    "<S> the existence of the mysterious pseudo - gap state in the phase diagram of copper oxide superconductors and its interplay with unconventional _ d - wave _ superconductivity has been a long standing issue for more than a decade . </S>",
    "<S> there is now a growing number of experimental indications that the pseudo - gap phase actually corresponds to a symmetry breaking state . in his theory for cuprates , c. m. varma proposes that the pseudo - gap is a new state of matter associated with the spontaneous appearance of circulating current loops within @xmath0 unit cell . </S>",
    "<S> this intra - unit - cell order breaks time reversal symmetry , but preserves lattice translation invariance . </S>",
    "<S> polarized elastic neutron scattering measurements provide evidence for an intra - unit - cell magnetic order inside the pseudo - gap state . </S>",
    "<S> this order could be produced by the orbital - like magnetic moments induced by the circulating current loops . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic order displays the same characteristic features in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 demonstrating that this genuine phase is ubiquitous of the pseudo - gap of high temperature copper oxide materials . </S>",
    "<S> we review the main properties characterizing this intra - unit - cell magnetic order and discuss its interplay or competition with other spin and charge instabilities . </S>"
