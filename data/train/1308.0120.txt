    "in _ distributed source coding _ problem , _ slepian - wolf ( sw ) _ theorem states that using joint decoding achieves higher compression rates compared to separate decoding of correlated sources @xcite .",
    "numerous distributed compression methods have been developed for non - uniform sources or sources with memory during recent years in the context of sensor networks , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "although there are many efficient coding methods for lossless compression , transmission of correlated sources over noisy channels based on the sw cooperation has been investigated quite recently @xcite . to exploit the benefit of the sw cooperation over the relay channels , _ joint source - channel decoding ( jscd ) _ techniques",
    "have been recently proposed based on turbo coding with significant bit error rate ( ber ) performance gain @xcite .",
    "turbo - like codes which are used for encoding of correlated sources are assumed , having long block - lengths and hence the decoding latency is a problem .",
    "thus , these codes are not suitable in certain practical applications due to decoding latency and/or power consumption limitations .",
    "furthermore , most of the research results on transmission of correlated bit sequences over noisy channels focus on sources without _ temporal correlation ( source memory ) _ , and hence the sources are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) in the time domain . in @xcite and @xcite , turbo and low - density generator - matrix ( ldgm ) codes",
    "were proposed for transmission of correlated binary i.i.d sources over additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel , respectively .",
    "also in @xcite , a joint iterative decoder of ldpc codes was introduced for correlated sources without memory .",
    "the decoding technique proposed in @xcite employs a two - stage iterative decoder , between which _ local _ and _ global _ iterations are performed . in the local iterations ,",
    "decoding is performed using the sum - product ( sp ) algorithm @xcite , while in the global iterations the estimate of correlation between the sources is passed on to the sp decoder to improve the decoding performance in the subsequent round of local iterations .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to propose a novel technique for the transmission of two correlated binary sequences following a first order markov process , in contrast to @xcite where the sources are i.i.d .",
    "relatively short - length ( length < @xmath0 ) ldpc codes with systematic parity - check matrices are used for the encoding of bit sequences to be transmitted because efficient performance improvement can be expected with the help of the correlation within and across the sequences in both the waterfall and error floor regions .    at the decoder side ,",
    "the joint decoder proposed in this paper exploits the information related to the temporal and source correlations in two stages . a standard bcjr decoder @xcite is serially concatenated to a sp decoder for the efficient utilization of the _ temporal memory _ structure inherent within the output sequences of the source .",
    "additionally , to exploit the source correlation , the method proposed in @xcite is used , where the _ log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) _ of the local iterations is updated according to the knowledge about the source correlation estimated in the previous global iteration .",
    "numerical results demonstrate that significant ber performance gains are achieved by the proposed jscd method for the correlated binary sequences generated by a markov source .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec::notation ] , basic concepts and notations related to the proposed algorithm",
    "are introduced . in section [ sec::model ] ,",
    "the proposed joint decoder structure is described in details . in section [ sec::simul ] ,",
    "simulation results and comparisons with decoders that do not exploit the temporal and source correlations are provided .",
    "finally , section [ sec::concul ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider two binary sources , one of them is modeled as a binary markov source whose sequences are denoted by @xmath1 , and the sequences of another source , denoted by @xmath2 , is assumed to be erroneous version of @xmath3 , corrupted by a binary noise with occurrence probability @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote a binary random variable with probability @xmath10 and a modulo-@xmath11 addition , respectively . the probability @xmath12 determines correlation ratio between the bit sequences of the two sources , i.e. , the smaller the @xmath4 is , the more correlated the sources are .",
    "the binary markov source considered in this paper is a stationary , ergodic , state emitting markov source @xmath13 , whose transition probabilities are described by the transition matrix @xmath14=\\left[\\begin{array}{c c } 1-\\alpha & \\alpha \\\\ \\beta & 1-\\beta \\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] where the transition probability is defined @xmath15    the stationary distribution of the source states is denoted by @xmath16 where @xmath17 . with the stationarity assumption , it can be easily shown that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are @xmath20 . if @xmath21 , the source described above is an _",
    "asymmetric _ binary markov source . otherwise , when @xmath22 the source is a",
    "_ symmetric _",
    "markov source with a uniform stationary distribution , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "the _ entropy rate _ of stationary binary markov source is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the binary entropy function @xcite .",
    "we will assume in this paper that the markov source characteristics , i.e. , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are known to the proposed decoder .",
    "estimation of markov source parameters was discussed for unknown temporal correlation parameters in @xcite .",
    "consider a binary ldpc code @xmath28 represented by a tanner graph @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the sets of variable nodes and check nodes , respectively , and @xmath32 is the set of edges .",
    "corresponding to @xmath33 , we have an @xmath34 parity - check matrix @xmath35 $ ] of @xmath28 , where @xmath36 if and only if ( iff ) the node @xmath37 is connected to the node @xmath38 in @xmath33 ; or equivalently , iff @xmath39 .",
    "the code rate of @xmath28 is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the rank of its argument matrix in @xmath42 .",
    "the _ degree _ of a variable or a check node is the number of nodes connected to it .",
    "if the nodes in the set @xmath43 and/or the nodes in the set @xmath44 have different degrees , the corresponding ldpc code is called _",
    "irregular_. for an irregular ldpc code , the _ degree distribution _ of variable nodes is described by the polynomial , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the maximum variable node degree and @xmath47 is the fraction of the edges connected to the variable nodes of degree @xmath48 .",
    "in our proposed scheme , two individual ldpc codes are used for encoding of the correlated bits over independent awgn channels .",
    "the encoded bits are transmitted over the channels by using binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) modulation .    to have an efficient ber performance , two types of optimized degree distributions over awgn channels with rates @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "are used @xcite . the corresponding variable node degree distribution for code rate @xmath49 is given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table i ) @xmath51 and for code rate @xmath50 is calculated as following @xmath52 both of which have maximum variable degree @xmath53 .",
    "a modified _ progressive edge growth ( peg ) _ method is used to construct relatively short - length parity - check matrices with very low error - floor performance@xcite . just for the simplicity of the iterative decoders ,",
    "we assume the systematic parity - check matrices with equal rates for the both channels .",
    "let @xmath54 denote the joint entropy of the first and the second sources . according to the sw bounds ,",
    "the total required rate to transmit the correlated information sequences over the both channels is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 for @xmath57 is the code rate of the @xmath48-th channel , where the terminologies and/or symbol notations follow @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the energy per source bit , @xmath58 , can then be related to the energy per information bit , @xmath59 , and the energy @xmath60 per sent symbol to be sent over the channels is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 in bpsk modulation",
    ".    in general , the parity - check matrices of each channel can be different in code rates .",
    "however , we only focus on the cases that both channels use the same rate of the codes ( _ symmetric case _ ) , i.e. , @xmath63 , hence the _",
    "shannon / sw _ limit for calculation of @xmath64 in the symmetric case is given by    @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively denote the noise variance of the two awgn channels , which is also assumed to be equal , and the noise power spectral density .",
    "moreover , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the entropy rate of the binary markov source and @xmath70 is the entropy of the correlation parameter .      in the class of jscd , which the proposed technique also belongs to ,",
    "the processing of correlation between the sources is performed at the decoder side .",
    "hence , the design of the joint decoder that can best exploit the source - channel code properties plays very important role . in the proposed decoder ,",
    "the temporal and source correlations are exploited in two consecutive iterations , these iterations are referred to as local ( horizontal ) and global ( vertical ) iterations . during the horizontal iterations , the systematic variable nodes have llr inputs from the received signals and a bcjr decoder matched to the trellis diagram of the markov source .",
    "the llrs are exchanged between variable and check nodes of the ldpc code until either no more relevant improvement in llr is achieved or a maximum number of local iterations is reached .",
    "then , the correlation between two bit sequences is estimated at the end of the horizontal iterations and the llr associated to the source correlation is passed on to the systematic variable nodes of each channel via the vertical iteration . for the initialization , the llrs to be used in the vertical iteration are first set zero for the both decoders .    in fig .",
    "[ fig::blkdiag ] , the block diagram of the proposed jscd structure is presented .",
    "let us consider the @xmath71-th local and the @xmath72-th global iteration of the proposed decoder .",
    "let @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively denote the llr messages passed from a variable node @xmath75 to a check node @xmath76 and from the @xmath76-th check node to the @xmath75-th variable node at the @xmath71-th iteration . also , @xmath77 represents the llr obtained from the received signal to be input to the variable node @xmath78 .",
    "thus , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the received noisy signal . the index of the channels is omitted for the simplicity , so far as no ambiguity is expected in the notations .",
    "the process for llr message updating in the variable nodes follows the standard sp decoding with additional llrs from the bcjr decoder with a modification due to the source correlation , as detailed for the expressions of eq . [ eq::eq8]-[eq::eq10 ] .",
    "the information exchange between the sp and the markov decoders does not contain the information obtained by the previous iterations , and hence is _",
    "extrinsic information_.",
    "the llr messages to be forwarded from the @xmath81 systematic variable nodes to the corresponding check nodes are given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 denote the extrinsic llr , sent from the markov decoder to the variable node @xmath75 and the llr already updated according to the correlation , respectively , in the @xmath71-th and the @xmath72-th iterations .",
    "it is worth mentioning that summation is performed only on the check nodes connected to the variable node @xmath75 .    for parity variable nodes ,",
    "the updated messages are obtained in the same way as the standard sp decoder , and is represented by @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "the messages @xmath74 are also updated in each local iteration exactly in the same way as the standard sp decoder .",
    "the input extrinsic llr of the markov decoder is calculated by subtracting the extrinsic llr of the markov decoder , obtained as the result of previous markov decoding , from the _ a posteriori _ llr , obtained as the result of the current sp decoding , in each local iteration .",
    "thus , the sent llr from a variable node @xmath75 to the markov decoder in the @xmath71-th iteration , denoted as @xmath88 , is calculated as @xmath89 where @xmath83 .",
    "furthermore , the bcjr decoder which uses the trellis diagram representing the markov source is applied to calculate the extrinsic @xmath84 values by the same equations represented in @xcite .    during the vertical iterations ,",
    "the llr @xmath90 of the binary error sequence , @xmath91 , is estimated .",
    "the estimate of the binary error , @xmath92 , in the @xmath72-th vertical iteration , is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath6 , is the estimated source ( systematic ) bits of the @xmath95-th channel obtained as the result of the horizontal iterations .",
    "hence , @xmath94 is calculated as @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the terminated horizontal iteration .",
    "the llr @xmath99 of @xmath92 is estimated using the method presented in @xcite , as @xmath100 where @xmath81 and @xmath101 denote the length of the original source packet and hamming weight of estimated binary error vector @xmath102 .    finally , according to the modulo-@xmath11 addition of the error sequence ,",
    "the updating llrs of the first and the second concatenated decoders are given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 denote , respectively , the hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic tangent functions .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the advantages characteristics of the jscd technique rather than using a single structure which only exploits either the temporal or source correlations .",
    "the distributed source - channel ( dsc ) coding was performed for symmetric and asymmetric binary markov sources with different code rates over awgn channels . in both examples ,",
    "the maximum number of local and global iterations for the proposed jscd technique was set at @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
