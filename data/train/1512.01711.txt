    "the interest in the study of quantum many - body systems from the modern standpoint of quantum field theories @xcite has grown since the 1960 s , ranging from low to extremely high energy and temperature regimes @xcite . in 1975 ,",
    "takahashi and umezawa proposed an operator - based formalism called thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) @xcite in order to describe quantum systems at finite temperature in thermal equilibrium .    in the same year",
    "the discovery of the hawking effect @xcite , from the black hole thermal radiation , was one of the most innovative results in quantum field theory in curved space - time .",
    "later on , davis @xcite suggested that a similar effect would occur even in a flat space - time . in 1976 , unruh @xcite showed that the essential characteristics of the hawking effect were contained in a simpler situation : an accelerated detector , would be excited by particles in vacuum , property known as the unruh effect .",
    "this discovery of the hawking - unruh effect has inspired many researchers , generating since them a series of important results , @xcite .",
    "there are two traditional approaches to the unruh effect , one is through the quantization of non - massive field in curvilinear coordinates , the other , due to dewitt @xcite and which we shall use in this work , is considering the acceleration as a hyperbolic parametrization in minkowski space time .",
    "the present work aims at investigating the manifestation of the unruh effect , approaching the issue from yet another perspective @xcite .",
    "we consider a two - level system in interaction with a non - massive scalar field , for which we deduce a master equation from von neumann equation .",
    "subsequently , we present the thermal states of thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) in the number representation and use it to thermalize the theory via vacuum expected values , singling out in a clearer way the unruh temperature .    the original proposal of unruh and dewitt , considers a detector as a point object that is linearly coupled with a zero mass scalar field through an interaction of monopole type    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is a coupling constant and @xmath2 is the monopole moment of the detector .",
    "specifically , @xmath3 is the hamiltonian of the detector which has a discrete spectrum @xmath4 we assume that the detector moves along the world line described by the coordinate @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the proper time of the detector .",
    "assume that at an initial instant @xmath7 the detector is in the state @xmath8 and the field in the vacuum @xmath9 .",
    "for an arbitrary trajectory , it is reasonable to assume that the detector will not remain in the initial state , but undergoes a transition to an excited state .",
    "therefore , for a later time @xmath10 , the detector is in the state @xmath11 and field in the state @xmath12 . for @xmath1",
    "sufficiently small , we can calculate via first order perturbation theory the transition probability    @xmath13    the wightman function in the integrand is well known and can be explicitly calculated , giving    @xmath14}.\\label{eq : funcao.wightman}\\ ] ]    firstly , we consider the case in which the detector follows a inertial world line , i.e. , the parametric equations    @xmath15    from which we obtain for the wightman function ,    @xmath16    and so the probability    @xmath17    the integral in turns out to be @xmath18 . therefore , the transition probability to an excited state is zero , since , as expected , a detector at rest must not spontaneously excite .",
    "now , consider the case where the detector is uniformly accelerated ; this is equivalent to a hyperbolic world line , parametrized according to    @xmath19    similarly , for the wightman function ,    @xmath20^{2}}\\mbox{,}\\label{eq : wightman.somatorio}\\ ] ]    so that the resulting probability is    @xmath21^{2}}.\\label{eq : prob.transi=0000e7ao.acelerado}\\ ] ]    after integration , it turns out to be    @xmath22    from which one recognizes the factor @xmath23^{-1}$ ] as being the planck distribution associated with the unruh temperature    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant .",

    "in this paper , after introducing the original motivation behind the so - called unruh - fulling - davies - dewitt effect through the response function of a detector , which undergoes hyperbolic motion , we have shown that the thermofield dynamics ( ftd ) formalism revealed itself as a natural scenario for describing the behaviour of accelerated systems at finite temperature . in such approach , the thermal states belong to a hilbert space in the number representation and describe a microscopic system interacting with a _ reservoir _ , leading to equations of motion for both the two - level detector and the radiation field , so that in the coarse - graining approach , the dynamics of these systems consist of a markovian process . supposing that the sub - systems reach a global thermal equilibrium at a common temperature , we have shown that the local fluctuation due to admissible couplings , enlarging the class of dewitt detectors , lead to a master equation for the population levels whose dynamics respect the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . as a result",

    "this is corroborated by the analysis of the vacuum fluctuation and radiation reaction hermitian contributions to the energy variation rates of the scalar field considered as a thermal _ reservoir _ by choosing a suitable operator ordering .",
