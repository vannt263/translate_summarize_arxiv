    "a schottky group of genus @xmath0 is a group of mbius transformations acting on the riemann sphere @xmath1 generated by @xmath0 elements @xmath2 , each of which possesses a pair of jordan curves @xmath3 , with the property that the @xmath4 curves are mutually disjoint and that @xmath5 maps @xmath6 onto @xmath7 where the outside of @xmath6 is sent onto the inside of @xmath7 .",
    "direct use of combination theorems tells us that the resulting group is free on @xmath0 generators , is discrete with a fundamental domain the region exterior to the @xmath4 curves , and consists entirely of loxodromic and hyperbolic elements .",
    "if in addition we can take all the jordan curves to be geometric circles then the resulting group is called a classical schottky group ( or sometimes in order to be more specific we say it is classical on the generators @xmath8 ) .",
    "marden @xcite showed that not all schottky groups are classical schottky groups .",
    "put very briefly , he argued that the algebraic limit of classical schottky groups must be geometrically finite and so his isomorphism theorem implies that the ordinary set @xmath9 of this limit can not be empty .",
    "but most groups on the boundary of schottky space have an empty ordinary set , so schottky space strictly contains classical schottky space . however , this argument is certainly non - constructive , raising the question of finding an explicit nonclassical schottky group .",
    "zarrow @xcite claimed to have found such an example , but the paper of sato @xcite shows that it is in fact a classical schottky group .",
    "a little later yamamoto @xcite did construct a nonclassical schottky group .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that if we examine the most straightforward cases where we might expect to find a counterexample , namely fuchsian schottky groups , then this approach is doomed to failure as all such groups are classical schottky groups .",
    "specifically we show that :    ( * 1*)given a fuchsian schottky group @xmath10 of any genus @xmath0 then there exists a generating set for @xmath10 of @xmath0 hyperbolic mbius transformations on which @xmath10 is classical .",
    "+ ( * 2*)the fuchsian schottky group @xmath10 is classical on all possible generating sets if and only if @xmath11 and @xmath10 is generated by a pair of hyperbolic elements with intersecting axes .",
    "+ ( * 3*)there exists a fuchsian group which is schottky on a particular generating set , but which can not be classical on those generators .",
    "+    the author would like to thank the referee for comments on an earlier draft of this paper .",
    "given any finitely generated fuchsian group @xmath10 ( namely a discrete subgroup of @xmath12 ) containing no elliptic elements , we form the quotient surface @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the upper half plane . the complete hyperbolic surface @xmath15 has ideal boundary @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the boundary of @xmath14 in the riemann sphere @xmath1 and @xmath18 is the ordinary set of @xmath10 .",
    "note that @xmath10 is schottky if and only if @xmath15 is a closed surface minus at least one hole ( although @xmath15 can not be a one - holed sphere ) .",
    "this is because a fuchsian group @xmath10 with a quotient surface @xmath15 as above must be free and purely hyperbolic , and this implies ( see , say @xcite ) that @xmath10 is indeed schottky .",
    "if @xmath15 is a surface of genus @xmath19 with @xmath20 holes then @xmath10 will be a free group of some rank @xmath21 .",
    "the process of doubling @xmath15 along its boundary corresponds to considering the quotient of the whole ordinary set @xmath18 by @xmath10 .",
    "as @xmath10 is a schottky group , @xmath22 is topologically a closed surface of genus @xmath21 .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the idea of the proof of theorem 1 is that given any such surface @xmath13 , we find a particular reference surface , homeomorphic to @xmath15 , which has a system of simple closed geodesics @xmath26 corresponding to a generating set for @xmath10 .",
    "we also find disjoint complete simple geodesics @xmath27 on this reference surface which are properly embedded ( they can be thought of as having their endpoints up the `` spouts '' ) , where @xmath28 intersects @xmath29 once and is disjoint from @xmath30 .",
    "we will find that if we cut along these geodesics @xmath31 , a disc is obtained .",
    "we are then able to transfer these curves across to @xmath15 . by viewing the process upstairs in the upper half plane @xmath14",
    "we get a fundamental domain for @xmath10 , and then we can see directly that @xmath10 is classical schottky on our generating set",
    ".    given a fuchsian schottky group @xmath10 of any genus @xmath0 then there exists a generating set for @xmath10 of @xmath0 hyperbolic mbius transformations on which @xmath10 is classical .",
    "we prove the result by taking a standard fuchsian classical schottky group @xmath32 for each possible topological surface of genus @xmath19 and @xmath20 holes , and transfer the two sets of geodesics to curves on any other surface homeomorphic to @xmath33 . these can be replaced by geodesics with all necessary properties preserved .",
    "first consider @xmath34 .",
    "we choose @xmath35 hyperbolic elements @xmath36 so that their axes all intersect at the same point , and ensure that @xmath37 is classical schottky by choosing the multipliers of the @xmath5 in order to obtain for each group @xmath38 a fundamental domain @xmath39 consisting of the intersection of the exteriors of two geodesics @xmath40 and @xmath41 so that all conditions of the free product combination theorem are satisfied ; namely that @xmath42 then we have a fundamental domain @xmath43 ( homeomorphic to a disc ) for the discrete group @xmath44 .",
    "there is one cycle of boundary intervals and so by the discussion above , the surface @xmath45 is indeed of genus @xmath19 with boundary a circle .",
    "we can project the axes of @xmath5 down onto the surface to obtain our simple closed geodesics @xmath29 , and do the same with each @xmath40 , which gives us the complete simple geodesic @xmath28 right up to its two endpoints on the boundary .",
    "these have the appropriate properties mentioned earlier , and we see that the surface becomes a disc after cutting along all the geodesics @xmath46 .",
    "the group @xmath47 and the projection of these geodesics are illustrated in figures 1 and 2 .    in order to construct @xmath32 when @xmath48 , take @xmath44 and choose an open interval @xmath49 between one endpoint of some @xmath40 and the nearest endpoint of a neighbouring geodesic @xmath50 .",
    "this interval lies inside the ordinary set of @xmath44 .",
    "then inductively nest @xmath51 geodesics inside the previous one , so that each geodesic has endpoints in @xmath49 .",
    "we then find hyperbolic transformations @xmath52 with axes these geodesics and with each transformation having two geodesics @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath53 , which it pairs .",
    "if these fundamental domains are correctly placed then @xmath54 is a discrete group having the correct quotient surface @xmath55 with a disc for a fundamental domain @xmath56 , where @xmath57 consists of @xmath58 geodesics @xmath40 and @xmath59 , along with the same number of intervals of @xmath17 .",
    "the geodesics and intervals alternate as we go round the boundary of the disc .",
    "also the projections of these axes and of these paired geodesics which define @xmath29 and @xmath28 have all the same properties as mentioned before . the case @xmath60 , @xmath61 is pictured in figures @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "now given any fuchsian schottky group @xmath10 with quotient surface @xmath15 and boundary @xmath64 , there exists a homeomorphism @xmath65 for some @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we also have natural continuous projections @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are both covering maps , and both domains are simply connected covering spaces of their images ( where the elementary neighbourhoods of points downstairs are open discs , or half discs for points on the boundary ) .    by the lifting theorem , we have a continuous map @xmath69 which is a lift of @xmath70 , so that @xmath71 . by reversing @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    ", we see that @xmath72 is a homeomorphism .",
    "take any element @xmath73 .",
    "this is a deck transformation of @xmath67 and so @xmath74 .",
    "conjugating @xmath0 by @xmath72 , we have @xmath75 , thus @xmath76 is a deck transformation of @xmath68 and therefore @xmath72 defines an isomorphism of @xmath32 onto @xmath10 by conjugation .",
    "note that @xmath72 maps @xmath14 to @xmath14 and @xmath77 to @xmath78 , because it is a lift of @xmath20 which sends boundary points to and from boundary points .",
    "therefore the image under @xmath72 of the fundamental domain @xmath56 is a disc in @xmath14 . but @xmath79 will consist of @xmath58 disjoint closed intervals of @xmath17 , along with curves @xmath80 and @xmath81 lying entirely in @xmath14 apart from their endpoints which are also endpoints of these intervals of @xmath17 .",
    "we find that the order in which the images under h of the @xmath40 , @xmath59 and the intervals appear around @xmath82 is the same as the original order around @xmath83 ( or the opposite order if @xmath72 is orientation reversing ) .    by setting @xmath84",
    "we obtain a generating set for @xmath10 , and because @xmath5 sends the geodesic @xmath40 to @xmath59 , we see that @xmath85 sends the curve @xmath80 to the curve @xmath81 . also it is easy to check that the disc @xmath86 is a fundamental domain for the action of @xmath10 on @xmath14 . in particular ,",
    "the intersection of the exteriors in @xmath14 of @xmath80 and @xmath81 is a fundamental domain for @xmath87 .",
    "we replace these two curves by geodesics @xmath88 and @xmath89 which have the same endpoints . just as in @xcite ,",
    "this gives us @xmath90 pairs of geodesics freely homotopic to the curves they replaced , and paired by a generating set @xmath91 with another fundamental domain @xmath92 for each group @xmath87 that lies between these two geodesics .",
    "the free product combination theorem can be applied to @xmath93 , as @xmath94 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "we can see this by looking at the endpoints of the geodesics which have not been changed when passing from curves .",
    "therefore , by reflecting this picture in the real axis , the group @xmath10 is generated by elements @xmath85 , each of which possesses a pair of mutually disjoint geometric circles @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with the outside of @xmath6 being sent by @xmath85 onto the inside of @xmath7 . by definition , @xmath10 is a classical schottky group .",
    "suppose we are given any two hyperbolic elements @xmath97 and @xmath98 with different axes .",
    "we want to know when @xmath99 is free , discrete and purely hyperbolic ( hence schottky ) .",
    "this problem falls naturally into two cases .",
    "+      ( * a*)the two hyperbolic elements have intersecting axes",
    ". then it is well known that @xmath10 is free , discrete and purely hyperbolic if and only if the commutator @xmath100 is hyperbolic .",
    "see for instance @xcite where this is shown by explicitly exhibiting two pairs of geometric circles , one paired by @xmath97 and one by @xmath98 . in this case",
    "the quotient surface is a one holed torus and , as any generating pair will have intersecting axes , we see that @xmath10 is classical on every possible generating pair .",
    "alternatively we can see this directly from section 1 by using the fact that there will exist a homeomorphism from our standard surface to the quotient surface of @xmath10 that takes the two simple closed geodesics @xmath101 onto two curves freely homotopic to the simple closed geodesics corresponding to any generating pair of @xmath10 .",
    "+ ( * b*)the hyperbolic elements have non - intersecting axes .",
    "if so then all generating pairs of @xmath10 must have non - intersecting axes , or else we are back in case ( a ) .",
    "first suppose @xmath10 is a classical schottky group on these two generators @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "without loss of generality we can replace any generator by its inverse so that we get a picture such as the one in figure 5 , with the arrows on the two generators in the same direction .",
    "the quotient surface is a three holed sphere .",
    "note that the axis of @xmath102 projects down onto a `` figure of eight '' geodesic , and so this group can not be classical on the generating pair @xmath103 .",
    "we have already considered any @xmath10 generated by two elements . given any @xmath10 generated by three or more elements",
    ", we can find a pair of generators with non - intersecting axes , and use the above argument on the subgroup generated by this pair . as",
    "the subgroup is not classical on all generating sets , nor is @xmath10 .",
    "a group @xmath99 ( where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are hyperbolic elements with non - intersecting axes , oriented as in figure 5 ) is classical on @xmath104 if and only if both fixed points of @xmath105 lie in the interval between the repelling fixed points of @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "if we know @xmath10 is classical on @xmath104 then we can build up a pattern of nested circles as in figure 5 , and see the location of the fixed points of the axes directly .",
    "conversely if we only have information as in figure 6 then we consider the image of a suitable point @xmath106 under the generators .",
    "the axis of @xmath105 is sent to the axis of @xmath107 by both generators , and also note that the arrows on @xmath107 and @xmath105 are as in the picture ( for instance consider the image of a fixed point of @xmath97 ) .",
    "then we choose any @xmath106 inside the interval enclosed by the axis of @xmath105 , and mark it and its images under @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we can take any two points @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the interval between @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and use these as endpoints for the geometric circles we require .",
    "we can see that @xmath112 will be closer than @xmath106 to the repelling fixed point of @xmath97 , and similarly with @xmath113 and @xmath98 .",
    "this gives us four endpoints @xmath114 and @xmath113 , one for each circle .",
    "we have four more endpoints to mark but this choice is totally arbitrary : merely pick any point in the interval between @xmath97 s fixed points , along with its image under @xmath97 , and do the same for @xmath98 too .",
    "this provides us with our two pairs of circles which show that @xmath10 is discrete , and classical on @xmath104 .",
    "the exterior @xmath115 of the two pairs of curves @xmath116 ( paired by @xmath97 ) and @xmath117 ( paired by @xmath98 ) is a fundamental domain , and is sent by the element @xmath107 inside the circle @xmath118 .",
    "the attracting fixed point of @xmath107 must lie inside @xmath119 and therefore it separates the fixed points of @xmath97 ."
