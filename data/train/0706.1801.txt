    "what was the universe like at high redshifts ? we are currently entering a time where we can begin to observe this early time in the universe s life by looking for galaxies at redshifts above 6 .",
    "there are several indications that stars , and hence galaxies , existed at this early time .",
    "we know that the universe was reionized early from observations such as the polarized light of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , the gunn - peterson test towards quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a gamma - ray burst @xcite , and the temperature of the intergalactic medium @xcite .    in order to produce large scale reionization , an efficient and plentiful source of ultraviolet photons was needed .",
    "the first few generations of stars are very likely candidates , producing ultraviolet photons efficiently .",
    "the ly@xmath0 forest shows that the universe was polluted with metals as early as @xmath24 @xcite , indicating even earlier star formation and thus providing further support of early stars .",
    "in addition , a portion of the near infrared background could be the redshifted light from the first stars , and may provide information about them @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very likely that there is significant star formation above @xmath25 . with the introduction of new , more powerful telescopes and deep field searches ,",
    "an interesting question arises : do these first stars form galaxies that are bright enough to be seen today ?",
    "several deep field ly@xmath0 searches have been performed with the isaac on the vlt @xcite , the mayall telescope at kitt peak @xcite , and the subaru telescope @xcite , probing the universe at redshifts of six and higher .    in this paper , we present a simple method to calculate the luminosity function of high-@xmath23 galaxies , and compare this with the results of ly@xmath0 searches to constrain properties of ly@xmath0 emitters . in   [ sec : formalism ] , we explain our method to calculate the luminosity function of high-@xmath23 galaxies with a single free parameter , a mass - to - observed light ratio , @xmath2 . in   [ sec : observations ] , we review the current generation high redshift galaxy surveys and their data . in   [ sec : interpretation ] we model stellar populations to obtain actual physical quantities about the galaxies that we observe .",
    "we compare our results to previous work in   [ sec : compare ] and conclude in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we use the latest wmap 3 parameters of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to predict the cumulative luminosity function of galaxies is to count the number of haloes available in the universe above a certain mass , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the survey volume , @xmath34 the comoving number density of haloes per unit mass range , and @xmath3 the total mass of a halo .",
    "the cumulative number density of haloes , @xmath35 , is shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : stdndm ] . in order to calculate the cumulative luminosity function",
    ", one may simply `` stretch '' the horizontal axis of this figure by dividing @xmath3 by a suitable factor that converts the mass to luminosity : a mass - to - light ratio , @xmath36 .",
    "this model is admittedly oversimplified , and is indeed simpler than what is already available in the literature .",
    "for example , one can stretch not only the horizontal axis ( i.e. , mass ) , but also the vertical axis of the cumulative mass function as @xmath37 , where @xmath14 is often called a `` duty cycle '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the vertical stretch would be required when the average lifetime of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies , @xmath38 , is shorter than the age of the universe , in which case the number count should be given by the time derivative of the mass function , @xmath39 .",
    "the vertical stretch parameter is thus given approximately by @xmath40 .",
    "since the statistical power of the current data is not yet strong enough to constrain both the horizontal and vertical stretch parameters simultaneously , these parameters are strongly degenerate @xcite .",
    "they are completely degenerate when @xmath41 follows a single power law , @xmath16 .",
    "the degeneracy line is given by @xmath42 ; thus , the inferred @xmath36 and @xmath14 are positively correlated : the smaller the @xmath14 is , the smaller the inferred @xmath36 becomes .    in order to lift this degeneracy , therefore , it is essential to detect the deviation of @xmath41 from a power law . since the cumulative mass function in @xmath43 begins to decline exponentially with mass at a few times @xmath44 at @xmath45 to @xmath46 at @xmath47 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : stdndm ] ) , an accurate determination of the bright end of the luminosity function at @xmath48 at @xmath47 to @xmath49 at @xmath45 would be required to lift the degeneracy .",
    "( note that @xmath36 is always quoted in units of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 . )",
    "the bright end of the luminosity function is not constrained very well by the existing surveys ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : numberfields ] ) .",
    "one would need a larger survey area for a better determination of the bright end of the luminosity function .",
    "( see section [ sec : lband ] for further discussion on constraining the bright end of the luminosity function . )",
    "we have chosen to work with @xmath52 , which is allowed by the existing data @xcite . as we show in this paper , this assumption does provide reasonable and useful results .",
    "we then use the degeneracy line , @xmath42 , to incorporate the effect of @xmath14 into the inferred constraints on properties of ly@xmath0 emitters .",
    "a further improvement to the model can be made by taking into account the fact that a relation between the luminosity and halo mass is not unique , but has some dispersion .",
    "one may include this by using a conditional probability of luminosity given the halo mass , @xmath53 , as @xmath54 with @xmath53 given by , e.g. , a log - normal distribution @xcite .",
    "once again , the current data can not constrain the extra parameters characterizing @xmath53 , except for its first - order moment , a mass - to - luminosity ratio . in our simplified approach",
    "we take it to be a delta function , @xmath55 $ ] , which gives equation  ( [ eq : simplemodel ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we shall use the sheth - tormen formula for @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "since the press - schechter mass function @xcite tends to underestimate the number of haloes in the high mass range , the mass - to - light ratio inferred from the press - schechter mass function would be smaller than that from the sheth - tormen formula .",
    "we have found that the mass - to - light inferred from the press - schechter mass function is smaller by a factor of two .",
    "the volume , @xmath33 , is found by multiplying the comoving volume element , @xmath56 , by the depth of the survey ( found by integrating over redshift ) and the survey area on the sky .",
    "for narrow - band surveys , the redshift integral can be approximated as @xmath57 .",
    "the comoving volume element is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the proper luminosity distance .      from equation  ( [ eq : simplemodel ] )",
    "we can derive the number of galaxies observed above a certain flux density as : @xmath60 where @xmath3 is the halo mass .",

    "this is represented by the function @xmath65 , which is zero if the halo mass is smaller than @xmath64 and unity if it is larger than or equal to @xmath64 .",
    "the minimum mass is only theoretically known , and we use the virial mass of a @xmath66 k halo , @xmath67^{-3/2}$ ] .",
    "however , given the current sensitivity of telescopes , it is unlikely that a halo of mass @xmath64 will be bright enough to be seen , unless the mass to light ratio of galaxies is unusually small .",
    "therefore , @xmath64 is irrelevant to our analysis presented in this paper and our conclusion is independent of the actual value of @xmath64 .",
    "in deriving equation  ( [ eq : fdndm ] ) , we have made an assumption that each dark matter halo above @xmath64 hosts one galaxy .",
    "this is a valid assumption at high redshifts , as massive haloes such as groups ( @xmath68 ) and clusters ( @xmath69 ) of galaxies hosting multiple galaxies are extremely rare ( see fig . [",
    "fig : stdndm ] ) .",
    "if we were to assume a field size equal to the largest survey area discussed in this paper ( that of the lala survey , 1296 arcmin@xmath70 ) , and the widest redshift range ( that of the subaru survey at z@xmath71 ) , the number of haloes above a mass of @xmath72 can be found by using equation [ eq : simplemodel ] . at a redshift of 1",
    ", there would be 32 haloes larger than this mass in the field . at higher redshifts ( @xmath73,@xmath74 , and @xmath75 )",
    ", there would be less than one such massive halo in the field ( 0.98 , 1@xmath76 , and @xmath77 , respectively . )",
    "thus at high redshifts , it is safe to assume that there are no groups or clusters observed .",
    "( larger surveys @xcite have observed protoclusters ) .",
    "this property makes it possible to model the luminosity function of high-@xmath23 galaxies without complications arising from galaxy formation processes .",
    "some observations ( i.e. @xcite ) show that some dark matter haloes host more than one ly@xmath0 emitter .",
    "however , since galaxy occupation number at high redshifts is not well known , we will just assume one galaxy per halo .",
    "the most important uncertainty in our model is that not all galaxies are seen as ly@xmath0 emitters .",
    "some galaxies do not produce as many ly@xmath0 photons as the others do because of dust extinction in galaxies themselves and scattering in the igm .",
    "therefore we could have assumed that there is less than one ly@xmath0 emitter per halo ; however , this effect can be modeled effectively by introducing a ly@xmath0 survival fraction , @xmath5 .",
    "this parameter quantifies the fraction of ly@xmath0 photons that escaped from a halo _ and _ the igm .",
    "therefore , as @xmath5 increases , a galaxy is seen as more luminous intrinsically .    in summary",
    ", we model the galaxy number counts by placing one galaxy per halo with only a fraction of photons escaping from galaxies and the igm .",
    "our formulation is now reliant on how we relate the flux density of a galaxy to its mass .",
    "the flux density of galaxies depends on two things : the luminosity distance to galaxies , and a mass - to-``observed light '' ratio , which will relate the total mass of the halo ( including dark matter ) to the luminosity that is actually observed .",
    "the flux density of a galaxy observed by a certain instrument is found by : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the bandwidth of the instrument ( which we have assumed to have an ideal rectangular bandpass ) and @xmath80 is the observed luminosity within a certain bandwidth of the instrument , @xmath81 the rest - frame luminosity per unit rest - frame frequency , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 the frequency limits of the survey .",
    "we assume that the mass to light ratio is independent of mass , @xmath84 .",
    "this approximation is well justified , as the current surveys are probing a limited mass range .",
    "total and stellar masses are still unknown for ly@xmath0 emitters . studies of the stellar masses using sed fitting have just begun @xcite . in the future when the observations of ly@xmath0 emitters can cover a wide mass range",
    ", one may use a parametrized model , e.g. , @xmath85 , to improve fits . for the present purpose additional parameters are unnecessary .    using equation ( [ eq : fluxlum ] ) , equation ( [ eq : fdndm ] )",
    "can be rewritten with respect to @xmath2 : @xmath86 to evaluate @xmath87 for a given @xmath88 , we use equation  ( [ eq : fluxlum ] ) to convert @xmath88 to @xmath3 .",
    "once again , @xmath2 is independent of @xmath3 , and @xmath3 is almost always greater than @xmath64 , and thus almost always @xmath89 . the only unknown quantity in this equation is @xmath2 , while @xmath79 , @xmath90 , and @xmath57 are given by the survey properties . in other words",
