    "plasmon resonances may occur in metallic ( gold or silver ) nanoparticles under the following two conditions : 1 ) dielectric permittivity of nanoparticles is negative and 2 ) the free - space wavelength of incident radiation is appreciably larger than geometric dimensions of nanoparticles .",
    "these two conditions are naturally and simultaneously realized at the nanoscale . for this reason ,",
    "plasmon resonances are intrinsically nanoscale phenomena .",
    "these resonances result in powerful nanoscale sources of light which have many important applications in such areas as nano - lithography , near - field optical microscopy , surface enhanced raman scattering ( sers ) , biosensors , nanophotonics , optical and magnetic data storage , etc .    in this paper , the eigenvalue approach @xcite-@xcite to the analysis of plasmon resonance modes in nanoparticles",
    "is reviewed and general properties of plasmon spectrum are presented .",
    "the excitation conditions of desired plasmon resonance modes are discussed along with the time - dynamics of excitation and dephasing of these modes .",
    "some selective applications of plasmon resonances to magnetics are described .",
    "these applications include plasmon resonance enhancement of magneto - optic effects , all - optical magnetic recording and thermally assisted magnetic recording .",
    "finally , interesting relation of eigenvalue treatment of plasmon resonances to the riemann hypothesis is discussed .",
    "to start the discussion , we first stress that plasmon resonances are electrostatic in nature , because they occur at free - space wavelengths that are much larger than particle dimensions .",
    "since the permittivity of nanoparticle is negative , the uniqueness theorem of electrostatics is not valid , and nonzero source - free solutions of electrostatics may appear .",
    "these nonzero source - free solutions are the manifestation of plasmon resonances . to find these source - free solutions ( i.e. , plasmon resonance modes ) , surface electric charges @xmath0 on the nanoparticle boundary can be introduced ( see figure 1 ) .    ;",
    "( b ) modeling of plasmon resonance modes by using the distribution of surface charges @xmath0 . ]",
    "the electric field created by these surface charges in free space satisfies all electrostatic equations except the boundary conditions for the normal component of electric field on the nanoparticle surface @xmath1 .",
    "it can be shown [ 1,2 ] that the latter boundary condition will be fulfilled if the density of electric charges @xmath0 satisfies the following boundary integral equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and all other notations have their usual meaning .",
    "it is apparent that nonzero solution of homogeneous integral equation ( 1 ) may exist only for special values @xmath4 , which are the eigenvalues of the integral operator in ( 1 ) : @xmath5 as soon as eigenvalues @xmath4 are found , the corresponding resonance values of permittivity @xmath6 can be determined from ( 3 ) and then the resonance frequency @xmath7 is calculated by using the nanoparticle dispersion relation @xmath8 : @xmath9.\\ ] ] the eigenfunctions @xmath10 corresponding to @xmath4 create fields which can be construed as plasmon resonance modes .    there is another , dual approach to the analysis of plasmon resonance modes . in this approach ,",
    "double layers of electric charges @xmath11 are introduced on nanoparticle boundaries instead of single layer of electric charges @xmath0 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the distribution of these double layers must be chosen in such a way that they produce in free space the same field of electric displacement @xmath12 as may exist for actual plasmon modes in the presence of nanoparticles .",
    "it can be shown ( see [ 1,2 ] ) that the latter will be the case if the density @xmath11 of double layers satisfies the following boundary integral equation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is given by formula ( 2 ) .",
    "it is apparent that the last integral equation is adjoint to equation ( 1 ) and , as discussed below , they have the same set of eigenvalues @xmath4 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of equations ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) are biorthogonal , @xmath15 in numerical calculations , boundary integral equations are discretized and reduced to eigenvalue problems for fully populated matrices .",
    "since these matrices are generated through the discretization of integral operators with @xmath16-type kernels , numerical computations can be considerably sped up by using the fast multipole method [ 4,5 ] .",
    "it can be shown [ 6,7 ] that the spectrum of integral equations ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) has the following interesting properties . for any shape of nanoparticles the eigenvalues of integral equations ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) are real , which implies ( according to the fredholm theory ) that these eigenvalues are the same for both equations .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 is an eigenvalue , while for all other eigenvalues , @xmath18 the eigenvalue @xmath17 does not belong to the plasmonic spectrum .",
    "its respective eigenfunction @xmath19 corresponds to the classical robin problem of distribution of electric charges over the surface of an ideal conductor .",
    "all other eigenvalues correspond to plasmon resonance modes and according to ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) these modes may exist only for negative @xmath6 , as expected .",
    "it can also be shown that the eigenvalues @xmath4 are simple poles of resolvents of integral equations ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) , respectively .",
    "unique spectral properties of plasmon resonances occur for metallic nanowires , i.e. , in the two - dimensional case [ 1 - 2 ] . in this two - dimensional case , for any shape of nanowire cross - section the set of eigenvalues @xmath4 ( @xmath20 ) of the corresponding integral equation @xmath21 consists of pairs of positive and negative eigenvalues of the same absolute value .",
    "this phenomenon of `` symmetric ( twin ) spectrum '' is due to unique symmetry properties of the mathematical formulation of the plasmon resonance problem which appear in the two - dimensional case due to the existence of the stream function .",
    "the twin - spectrum phenomenon results in two distinct bands of plasmon resonances with relative dielectric permittivities being reciprocals to one another .",
    "this twin - spectrum phenomenon will be used below to establish some relation of plasmon resonances to the riemann hypothesis .",
    "it is apparent that the mathematical structure of integral equations ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) is invariant with respect to the scaling of @xmath1 , i.e. , scaling of nanoparticle dimensions .",
    "this implies the unique property of plasmon resonances : resonance frequencies depend on particle shape but not particle dimensions , provided that they remain appreciably smaller than the free - space wavelength .",
    "it is clear that the integral operator in equation ( 1 ) is not self - adjoint in @xmath22 because the kernel of this operator is not symmetric .",
    "for this reason , the eigenfunctions @xmath23 and @xmath10 corresponding to different eigenvalues @xmath24 and @xmath4 are not orthogonal on @xmath1 in the usual sense ( in @xmath25-norm ) .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown that electric fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 corresponding to eigenfunctions @xmath23 and @xmath10 satisfy the following strong orthogonality conditions : @xmath28 @xmath29 the peculiar feature of these strong orthogonality conditions is that they hold separately in regions @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "as previously discussed , plasmon resonances occur when the real part of dielectric permittivity is negative .",
    "this makes the classical formula @xmath32 for the time - average of stored electric energy density meaningless .",
    "it turns out that the last formula can be properly modified to be valid for slightly lossy ( transparent ) dispersive media .",
    "the modified formula is @xmath33}{d \\omega } | \\hat{\\mathbf{e } } |^2.\\ ] ]    the presented analysis of plasmon modes is purely electrostatic in nature and completely ignores radiation phenomena .",
    "it is shown in [ 2 ] that the radiation corrections can be mathematically treated as perturbations with respect to a small parameter which is the ratio of particle dimension ( its diameter ) to the free - space wavelength .",
    "it is demonstrated that the first - order radiation corrections to the resonance value of dielectric permittivity ( hence , to the resonance frequency ) and to plasmon mode electric field are equal to zero for any shape of metallic nanoparticle .",
    "the explicit second - order radiation corrections for the resonance values of dielectric permittivity are derived in [ 2 ] and it is shown that in the particular case of spherical nanoparticles these second - order radiation corrections coincide with the radiation corrections obtained from the classical mie theory .",
    "the excitation of plasmon resonance modes by the incident light can be studied by using the biorthogonal expansion of electric charges @xmath34 induced on @xmath1 during the excitation process : @xmath35 @xmath36 it is clear that the time evolution of the expansion coefficient @xmath37 reveals the time - dynamics of excitation ( and dephasing ) of the plasmon mode corresponding to the eigenfunction @xmath10 .",
    "this dynamics has been studied in [ 3 ] , and below , only a few , most salient , results from [ 3 ] are presented .",
    "namely , the following analytical expression for the steady state @xmath38 of the expansion coefficient in ( 14 ) can be derived in the case of resonance excitation : @xmath39 . & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath40 is the electric field of the incident radiation , while @xmath41 is the dipole moment of the @xmath42-th plasmon mode .",
    "the last expression clearly reveals that the desired plasmon modes are most efficiently excited when the directions of their dipole moments are parallel to @xmath40 and when @xmath43 , where @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the ratio @xmath45 is most appreciable for gold and silver when the free - space wavelength is between 700 nm and 1100 nm , and this ratio is appreciably higher for silver than for gold .",
    "thus , as far as the quality of plasmon resonances is concerned , silver is `` gold '' and gold is `` silver '' .",
    "this fact has long been appreciated in the sers research area where silver nanoparticles have been predominantly used in experiments . for off - resonance excitation with frequency @xmath46 ,",
    "the following expression has been derived [ 3 ] : @xmath47 where @xmath48 ^ 2 + [ \\epsilon''(\\omega_0)]^2}{[\\epsilon_k - \\epsilon'(\\omega_0)]^2 + [ \\epsilon''(\\omega_0)]^2 } } .\\ ] ] the last formula is instrumental for evaluation of the sharpness ( width ) of plasmon resonances .    in the case of the drude model for the dispersion of dielectric permittivity",
    ", simple analytical expressions for time - dynamics of excitation and dephasing of particular plasmon modes have been derived in [ 3 ] .",
    "in this section , only a few sample applications of plasmon resonances to magnetics are briefly discussed .",
    "we first consider the enhancement of magneto - optic effects in garnet films by plasmon resonances excited in metallic nanoparticles embedded in these films .",
    "it is known that on the macroscopic level magnetic garnets act as gyrotropic media that discriminate between right - handed and left - handed polarizations of light .",
    "this results in the faraday magneto - optic effect . on the microscopic level ,",
    "magneto - optic effects are controlled by spin - orbit coupling , which is described by the hamiltonian which depends on local electric fields .",
    "these fields can be optically induced through plasmon resonances in metallic ( gold ) nanoparticles embedded in garnets , which may eventually lead to the enhancement of magneto - optic effects . in this way",
    ", plasmon resonances can be practically utilized for the enhancement of the faraday effect as well as for the probing of the origin of this effect on the very fundamental microscopic level .    some experimental research",
    "[ 8 ] has been conducted to test the feasibility of the idea described above .",
    "in particular , garnet films have been grown over ( 100)-oriented substituted gadolinium gallium garnet ( sggg ) substrates partially populated with gold nanoparticles .",
    "these gold nanoparticles have been created by evaporating thin layers ( about 5 nm ) of gold on selected areas of sggg garnet substrates and subsequently annealing them in air at about 830 @xmath49 .",
    "it has been observed that these gold nanoparticles have different dimensions but mostly the same hemispherical shape .",
    "for this reason , they resonate at practically the same frequency ( wavelength ) due to scale invariance of plasmon resonances . by using the liquid phase epitaxy ( lpe ) technique , thin magnetic garnet films of @xmath50 composition",
    "have been grown over gold nanoparticle - populated substrates .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurements have been performed and they reveal that after lpe growth gold nanoparticles survive in crystalline form . then",
    ", faraday rotation and magneto - optic loop measurements have been performed and meaningful ( non - negligible ) enhancement of faraday rotation which can be attributed to plasmon resonances in embedded nanoparticles has been observed .",
    "next , we shall briefly discuss the application of plasmon resonances to all - optical magnetic recording .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated [ 9 ] that femtosecond magnetization reversals of about 100 @xmath51 m spots of magnetic media can be achieved by using only circularly polarized laser pulses .",
    "the direction of magnetization reversals is controlled by the helicity of circularly polarized light .",
    "it is currently perceived that these magnetization reversals occur due to the combination of the local laser heating of magnetic media close to the curie temperature and the simultaneous action of circularly polarized light as an effective magnetic field with the direction parallel to the light - wave vector .",
    "furthermore , right- and left - handed circularly polarized light beams act as effective magnetic fields of opposite directions .",
    "the all - optical magnetization switching described above will be technologically feasible for magnetic recording only if the techniques for delivery of nanoscale - focused circularly polarized light are developed .",
    "the latter can be achieved by using optically excited plasmon resonances in uniaxial metallic nanostructures [ 10 - 11 ] .",
    "the central point is that in the case of uniaxial metallic nanoparticles ( or nano - holes / apertures ) the eigenvalues @xmath4 of integral equations ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) have geometric multiplicity of two and for each @xmath4 there are two identical ( up to ninety - degree rotation in space ) plasmon eigenmodes .",
    "these two plasmon modes have the same resonance frequency and can be simultaneously excited by the incident circularly polarized light .",
    "these two simultaneously excited plasmon modes form a circularly polarized plasmon mode that can be instrumental for the dramatic nanoscale enhancement ( focusing ) of the incident circularly polarized light .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that each of the two above - mentioned plasmon eigenmodes is not rotationally invariant , while their combination as a circularly polarized plasmon mode is rotationally invariant .",
    "it is also apparent that the circularly polarized plasmon modes are most efficiently coupled to the incident circularly polarized light when the direction of propagation of laser light coincides with the symmetry axis of the nanoparticles .    as discussed before ,",
    "plasmon resonances can be most efficiently excited in the 700 - 1100 nm free - space wavelength range . to obtain plasmon resonances in this range , oblate spheroidal nanoparticles with large aspect ratio or nano - rings can be used . another alternative is to use spherical or cylindrical nano - shells .",
    "this is because by controlling nano - shell thickness , plasmon resonances can be effectively shifted into the desired wavelength range [ 12 ] .",
    "our numerical simulations [ 10 - 11 ] demonstrated that the intensity of incident circularly polarized light can be increased 750 times in the case of silver nano - rings and 550 times in the case of silver nano - shells .",
    "finally , we shall briefly discuss the possible application of plasmon resonances to thermally assisted magnetic recording ( tamr ) .",
    "this type of recording has been the focus of considerable technological interest and ongoing research lately .",
    "the central issue is the development of optical sources of nanometer resolution and high light intensity .",
    "the proper profiling of optical spots is also an important practical issue because it may reduce the detrimental effect of the collateral heating of adjacent recorded bits .",
    "it has been demonstrated [ 13 ] that plasmon resonances in metallic nanoparticles and perforated metallic nano - films hold unique promise for the development of such optical sources . in particular ,",
    "two promising designs have been identified through numerous computations .",
    "they are rectangular bar - type metallic nanoparticles deposited on dielectric substrates and perforated metallic nano - films with rectangular apertures .",
    "the numerical modeling of these structures reveals that plasmon resonances in rectangular bar - type nanoparticles produce somewhat higher light intensity optical spots than the localized plasmon resonances in perforated nano - films . in addition",
    ", it has been found that plasmon resonances in the rectangular bar - type nanoparticles have some advantages as far as proper profiling of optical spots is concerned .",
    "the riemann hypothesis deals with the zeta function which for @xmath52 is defined by @xmath53 where @xmath54 are prime numbers and the right - hand side of ( 18 ) is the celebrated euler product taken over all prime numbers .    in [ 14 ] ( its english translation can be found in [ 15 ] ) riemann studied the analytical continuation of the zeta function defined by the infinite series in ( 18 ) .",
    "riemann found that @xmath55 extends to the whole complex plane as a meromorphic function with only one simple pole at @xmath56 with residue 1 and derived the functional equation for the extended @xmath55 .",
    "riemann then introduced the entire function @xmath57 @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the euler gamma function .",
    "the functional equation for @xmath55 implies that @xmath60 is an even function whose zeros have imaginary parts between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "then , riemann conjectured that all zeros of @xmath60 are real .",
    "this conjecture is the riemann hypothesis .",
    "the zeta function has zeros at negative integers -2 , -4 , ... , which correspond to the simple poles of the gamma function @xmath63 .",
    "these zeros are referred to as trivial zeros .",
    "the other nontrivial zeros are @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "these zeros are in the strip @xmath66 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "riemann derived the integral representation for @xmath60 and stated that @xmath60 `` can be developed as a power series ... which converges very rapidly . ''",
    "this power series can be written as follows [ 15 ] : @xmath69 where @xmath70 @xmath71 x^{-1/4}\\ ] ] and @xmath72 it can be proven [ 15 ] that for @xmath73 @xmath74 and , consequently , @xmath75 it is also apparent from formulas ( 21)-(24 ) that @xmath60 assumes real values for real @xmath14 and the set of its zeros consists of pairs @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",
    "riemann also suggested the validity of the following product formula , @xmath78 which was rigorously proved by hadamard .",
    "it is our intention to discuss the relation of the riemann xi - function @xmath60 to the eigenvalue treatment of plasmon resonances in nanoparticles . before proceeding with this discussion , it is worthwhile to remark at this point that the riemann hypothesis stated for xi - function defined by formulas ( 21)-(24 ) can be treated as a problem of complex analysis , detached from @xmath79 s number - theoretic origin .",
    "it is in this context that the following two questions can be naturally posed :    1 .   if the riemann hypothesis is valid , then how is the alignment of all zeros of @xmath60 along the real axis encoded in the mathematical structure of formulas ( 22)-(24 ) for the expansion coefficients @xmath80",
    "? 2 .   what are the necessary and sufficient conditions ( in terms of @xmath80 ) for the alignment along the real axis of all zeros of an entire function defined by the power series ( 21 ) ?            these properties of spectrum of integral equation ( 8) are valid for any sufficiently smooth curve @xmath82 .",
    "consider the integral equation @xmath83 dl_m,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 in the integrand stands for the length of curve @xmath82 .",
    "it can be shown that the integral equation ( 28 ) has the same spectrum as integral equation ( 8) except for the eigenvalue @xmath17 ( see figure 4b ) .",
    "the proof follows from the facts that for @xmath84 we have @xmath85 while for the robin problem ( @xmath17 ) @xmath86 indeed , from the well known formula @xmath87 follows the validity of eq .",
    "( 29 ) for the solutions of both integral equations ( 8) and ( 28 ) if @xmath84 .",
    "thus , these two equations are equivalent for those @xmath4 .",
    "however , this equivalence does not hold for @xmath88 , because equality ( 29 ) is still valid for integral equation ( 28 ) , while nonzero solution of integral equation ( 8) exists only under the condition ( 30 ) .",
    "now , it is apparent that the fredholm determinant @xmath89 of the integral equation ( 28 ) is the entire function that assumes real values for real @xmath14 and the set of its zeros consists of pairs of real numbers @xmath81 , @xmath77 . as discussed before ,",
    "these zeros are simple poles of the resolvent of the integral equation ( 28 ) .",
    "this implies that if @xmath82 does not have any symmetry and the geometric multiplicity of all @xmath4 is 1 ( i.e. , no accidental degeneration of @xmath4 ) , then @xmath4 are simple zeros of the fredholm determinant .",
    "furthermore , it has been proven ( see [ 16 ] ) that if a kernel of an integral equation is hlder - continuous with respect to the variable of integration ( which is the case for equation ( 28 ) when @xmath82 is smooth ) then the fredholm determinant is of genus zero .",
    "this implies the validity of the product formula for smooth @xmath82 : @xmath90 since @xmath89 is an even entire function , the following power series can be used for its representation : @xmath91 it is clear from the presented discussion that for various curves @xmath82 fredholm determinants of integral equation ( 28 ) form the class of entire functions with properties that have been conjectured or proved for the riemann xi - function @xmath60 . for this reason",
    ", the problem can be posed to find such curve @xmath82 that @xmath92 which will prove the riemann hypothesis . the last formula is consistent with a spectral interpretation of the riemann hypothesis advanced in the hilbert - polya conjecture .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that this conjecture deals with self - adjoint operator spectral interpretation .",
    "the integral operator in equation ( 28 ) is not self - adjoint in the space of square - summable functions because its kernel is not symmetric .",
    "however , this integral operator has real eigenvalues and they are simple poles of its resolvent .",
    "these properties are typical for self - adjoint operators .",
    "for this reason , it is not surprising that this operator will be self - adjoint in properly constructed `` energy '' function space as suggested by the orthogonality conditions ( 9)-(10 ) .",
    "indeed , consider the hilbert space with the inner product @xmath93 defined on functions with zero - mean over @xmath82 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath94 is positive and , up to a factor , it has the physical meaning of energy stored in the electric field created by the charge distribution @xmath95 over @xmath82 . by using the relation @xmath96 which follows from the green s formula",
    ", it can be shown that the integral operator in eq .",
    "( 28 ) is self - adjoint in this `` energy '' function space .    from formulas ( 21 ) , ( 33)-(34 ) and the known facts from the theory of integral equations",
    ", the following recurrent relations can be deduced : @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the kernel of integral equation ( 28 ) , @xmath102.\\ ] ] it is clear that by using formulas ( 37)-(41 ) the iterated traces of the kernel of the integral equation ( 28 ) @xmath103 @xmath104 can be sequentially found .",
    "if the kernel ( 41 ) can be reconstructed from its iterated traces , then curve @xmath82 can be reconstructed ( up to some scaling ) from this kernel .",
    "this is because @xmath105 is equal to half the curvature of @xmath82 at @xmath106 and a plane curve can be reconstructed from its curvature .",
    "the last formula offers another ( unrelated to the previous discussion ) approach to the pursuit of the proof of the riemann hypothesis . indeed , from the equality @xmath108 and from the product formula ( 27 ) , we find @xmath109 it is clear that the riemann hypothesis will be proven if it is established that all poles of the real meromorphic function on the left - hand side of ( 46 ) are real .",
    "it is here that the grommer theorem can be used which gives the necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of the riemann hypothesis in terms of expansion coefficients @xmath110 .",
    "namely , according to the grommer theorem [ 17,18 ] , the real meromorphic function on the left - hand side of ( 46 ) has only real poles , if and only if the expansion coefficients @xmath111 form the positive sequence , i.e. , hankel quadratic forms are positive , @xmath112 for any @xmath113 .    to verify inequality ( 47 ) , a linear functional @xmath114 defined on the set of polynomials @xmath115",

    "the last property follows from formulas ( 22 ) and ( 25 ) . by substituting formula ( 53 ) into ( 56 ) and using linearity of the functional @xmath114 , we find @xmath126 it is not clear at this time if the set of polynomials on which functional @xmath114 is positive ( see inequality ( 57 ) ) contains all `` complete - square '' polynomials ( 50 ) . in other words",
    ", it is not clear if the alignment of all zeros of @xmath60 along the real axis is fully encoded in inequalities ( 25 ) and ( 56 ) .",
    "these inequalities do not account ( among other things ) for the fast decay of @xmath127 defined by formulas ( 23)-(24 ) .",
    "the mathematical tools used in the presented discussion of the riemann hypothesis are quite modest by modern standards .",
