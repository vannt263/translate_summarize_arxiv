    "a linear transverse flow rapidity profile is perhaps the simplest , but not obviously the most realistic assumption .",
    "dynamical studies based on a numerical solution of the hydrodynamic equations @xcite produce transverse flow velocity profiles which for small values of @xmath179 look parabolic and for large @xmath179 saturate at the light velocity ; the parabolic rise is zero initially , but builds up gradually as the hydrodynamic pressure generates transverse flow . on the other hand , when combining such hydrodynamic calculations with a dynamic model for the freeze - out kinetics , taking into account sequential transverse freeze - out of the matter from the dilute edge at early times to the center at later times , the resulting flow profile _ along the freeze - out hypersurface _ turns out @xcite to be _ linear _",

    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] we see that qualitatively the @xmath111-dependence of the hbt radii is similar for both types of transverse flow profile . in all cases the model - independent expressions ( [ 4 ] ) yield hbt radii which give an excellent representation of the half - width of the correlator . for a given flow scale @xmath220 ,",
    "the flow effects on the hbt radii are stronger for the quadratic flow ( [ 28a ] ) than for the linear flow ( [ 27a ] ) .",

    "although exotic , this example should be kept in mind as a reminder that transverse flow not always leads to a decrease of the effective source size .",
    "the aim of hbt interferometry with hadrons produced in heavy ion collisions is to obtain information about the space - time structure of the emitter .",
    "unfortunately , a unique reconstruction of the emission function @xmath27 from the 2-particle correlation function @xmath236 is impossible , since the frequency @xmath237 and the spatial momenta @xmath32 in the fourier transformation relating the two functions are not independent , as the final state hadrons are on mass - shell .",
    "however , the class of possible models for the emission function can be strongly restricted by a careful multidimensional hbt analysis of the 2-body correlation function .",
    "in particular , a careful analysis of the dependence of the hbt radii ( which describe the width of the correlator as a function of the relative momentum @xmath32 ) on the pair momentum @xmath35 provides crucial information on the correlations between emission point @xmath8 and particle momentum @xmath18 in the source .",
    "such @xmath238 correlations are generated , for example , by the collective expansion of the sources generated in heavy ion collisions .",
    "recently heavy ion experiments @xcite have begun to provide first quantitative information on the @xmath35-dependence of the hbt correlation functions .",
    "the hope to obtain access to the collective behaviour in heavy ion collisions by analyzing these results has refuelled the theoretical interest in the @xmath35-dependence of the hbt radii .    in this paper we reanalyzed this issue with a combination of numerical and analytical methods .",
    "for a given source model , the numerical methods provide us with exact predictions for the transverse momentum dependence of the hbt radii .",
    "they thus establish a reliable link between various possible models for the emission function and the experimental data for the correlation function .",
    "the analytical approach provides , in the context of a specific source model studied in this paper , a mathematical understanding of the numerical results and a bridge between approximate analytical expressions published previously and the exact numerical results obtained here , and thus permits to test their reliability .",
    "our numerical studies showed that the model - independent expressions ( [ 4 ] ) for the hbt radii not only give the correct curvature of the correlation function @xmath239 for small values of @xmath240 ( as was known before @xcite ) , but also reproduce on most cases the width of the correlator quite accurately .",
    "as long as the measured correlation function has a roughly gaussian shape in @xmath32 , these expressions provide an accurate and valuable link between theory and experiment and permit to relate the ( @xmath35-dependent ) width parameters of the correlation function to the ( @xmath35-dependent ) space - time width of the original source function . in this context it should be cautioned , however , that the effects of resonance decays , which are numerically known to give the correlation function a non - gaussian shape @xcite , remain to be studied in more detail .",
    "furthermore , this result means that _ only _ the half - widths of the emission function in space - time can be reconstructed from the width of the correlation function .",
    "finer details of the space - time structure of the emitter ( like sharp edges or holes in the center ) do not affect the width of the correlator , but can only be estimated by a very accurate study of the long - range decay of the correlator ( e.g. by looking for side maxima at larger values of @xmath32 ) .",
    "the numerical study also enables us to give a detailed assessment of the accuracy of previously published approximate analytical results for the hbt radius parameters .",
    "this is of particular interest since some of these results have gained great popularity because of their simple scaling behaviour as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "here our results cause disappointment : none of the so far suggested simple scaling laws is quantitatively reliable , except for very limiting situations which are not likely to be established in experiments . to make quantitative use of the measured @xmath35-dependence of the correlation function and to obtain reasonably accurate estimates for the lifetime , transverse geometric size and collective expansion rate of the source , a full - blown numerical evaluation of the expressions ( [ 4 ] )",
    "is required , at least .",
    "the simple scaling laws should not be used ",
    "we showed that they yield badly misleading results .    for the specific source studied in this paper",
    "the duration of particle emission is very short , of order @xmath241 ( @xmath242 fm/@xmath201 at @xmath225 ) .",

    "the rise stops at @xmath243 ( when @xmath244 approaches unity ) , and beyond that point @xmath132 and the difference between @xmath245 decreases again ( because @xmath246 decreases ) .",
    "the experimental verification of the effect of a finite duration of particle emission thus requires a high - statistics study of the correlation function at small @xmath111 .",
    "one might argue that realistic models in which the sharp freeze - out along a proper time hyperbola is replaced by continuous freeze - out over a longer time period should lead to a larger effect which is more easily seen in the data .",
    "however , in such models usually the source shrinks as the particles evaporate , and particles emitted at later times come from smaller regions near the center of the fireball ; the net effect on the difference @xmath247 seems to remain small and concentrated at small @xmath229 mev/@xmath201 @xcite . in the light of these new expectations",
    "the failure of the experiments so far @xcite to provide positive evidence for a finite period of particle emission appears less puzzling .",

    "<S> the transverse momentum dependence of hanbury - brown / twiss ( hbt ) interferometry radii for 2-body correlation functions provides experimental access to the collective dynamics in heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we present an analytical approximation scheme for these hbt radii which combines the recently derived model - independent expressions with an approximate determination of the saddle point of the emission function . </S>",
    "<S> the method is illustrated for a longitudinally boost - invariant hydrodynamical model of a heavy ion collision with freeze - out on a sharp hypersurface . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical approximation converges rapidly to the width of the numerically computed correlation function and reproduces correctly its exact transverse momentum dependence </S>",
    "<S> . however , higher order corrections within our approximation scheme are essential , and the previously published lowest order results with simple @xmath0 scaling behaviour are quantitatively and qualitatively unreliable .    -1 cm </S>"
