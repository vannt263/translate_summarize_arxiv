    "the ly@xmath0  luminosity , equivalent width , w@xmath6 , and ly@xmath0/h@xmath0  flux ratio of galaxies are seen to vary widely , and are difficult to predict from other galaxy properties like star formation rate ( sfr ) and dust extinction @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , it is believed that the ly@xmath0  emission line is modified by resonant scattering in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and circumgalactic medium ( cgm ) .",
    "this process increases the optical depth of ly@xmath0  photons , making them more susceptible to dust absorption and sometimes turns the emission profile into absorption .",
    "alternatively , in the absence of dust , the ly@xmath0  photons may simply diffuse to large radii and be missed by poor sensitivity to low surface brightness emission @xcite . besides dust and geometry of the hi gas",
    ", the kinematics of galaxy outflows may also play a role , since ly@xmath0  photons may escape more easily when scattered by neutral hydrogen that is out of resonance with the ism @xcite .",

    "we describe these quantities below . in most cases ,",
    "the high s / n of these data imply insignificant statistical errors on the measurements .",
    "therefore we do not list these uncertainties .",
    "first , we chose to re - measure the emission lines in the sdss spectra rather than use catalog measurements .",
    "one of the green peas in our sample ( 0303 - 0759 ) contains an unphysical balmer decrement ( an h@xmath0/h@xmath2  flux ratio of 2.25 ) in the mpa - jhu dr7 catalogs , which is the result of an incorrect h@xmath0  flux .",
    "this failure may be attributable to difficulty in fitting the nearly blended h@xmath0 + [ ]  lines with single gaussians , when the lines clearly show evidence of broad wings extending hundreds of km s@xmath20 ( also noted by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , for each of the green peas in this paper , we re - fit the emission line spectra with two kinematic components .",
    "we defined a kinematic model with a narrow component centered at the systemic redshift ( @xmath26 ) , and a broad component which is allowed to be offset from @xmath26 . for 25 of the strongest lines in the spectrum ( h@xmath0  through h9 , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] and 7 lines )",
    ", the amplitudes of the broad and narrow components were allowed to vary , but their velocity widths and centroids were required to be the same from line to line .",
    "hence , the resultant model has 54 free parameters ( redshift , doppler shift of the broad component , velocity widths of both the broad and narrow component , and two gaussian amplitudes for each line ) .",
    "this model was fit to the continuum subtracted spectrum provided by the sdss , thereby measuring redshifts ( table [ sample ] ) , emission line fluxes ( for the combined broad and narrow kinematic components ) , and the kinematics of the ionized gas .",
    "equivalent widths are evaluated by taking the ratio of the emission line flux to the median continuum flux density in a 100   window centered on each line .",
    "the kinematic measures derived from our fits are similar for all of the green peas , showing a narrow component at the systemic redshift with a fwhm around 200 km s@xmath20 , and a broad component , also centered near @xmath27 , with a fwhm around 500 km s@xmath20 . for the isolated h@xmath2  line",

    "this intrinsic ratio is appropriate for electron temperature @xmath28 k and density @xmath29 @xmath30 ; increasing @xmath11 two - fold decreases the intrinsic balmer decrement to 2.75 and increases the extinction , @xmath31 , by approximately 0.03 magnitudes .",

    "the remaining 9 green peas were observed as part of go 12928 ( pi a.  henry ) .",

    "the target acquisition images of the green peas are shown in figure [ ta_images ] .",
    "these data indicate relatively compact emission , implying that most of the uv continuum emission from these galaxies falls within the central 1  diameter of the cos aperture ( shown as circles ) where vignetting is minimal .",
    "( likewise , if optical line emission closely follows the uv continuum , we expect negligible aperture losses in the 3  sdss fiber spectroscopy . )",
    "the spectra were obtained in the fuv , using both the g130 m and g160 m configurations ( in 9/10 ) ; with both gratings the rest - frame wavelength coverage spans from approximately @xmath40  , or somewhat shorter / longer depending on the redshifts .",
    "the rest - frame wavelengths covered for each galaxy are listed in table [ sample ] , along with the exposure time for each grating . for 1424 + 4217 , the second orbit containing the g160 m observations failed",

    "@xmath41 km s@xmath20 .",
    "as recommended by the cos instrument handbook , all spectra were taken at four fp - pos settings in each grating in order to mitigate the effects of fixed pattern noise .",
    "in addition , the central wavelengths for each grating were chosen to avoid placing strong absorption lines between the a and b segments .",
    "for one galaxy ( 1054 + 5328 ) this choice was not possible in g130 m , so two central wavelengths were used . since calcos does not combine data taken at different central wavelengths , we combined them by simply taking the mean ( except in the gaps , where we adopt the values from the spectrum that has coverage ) .",
    "the errors were derived from taking the poisson noise on the total counts , as we will describe below in  [ noise ] .",
    "all data from go 12928 were taken at the cos lifetime position two ; they were downloaded from mast 2013 august 23 implying that they were processed with calcos version 2.19.7 .",
    "the spectra from go 11727 were taken in lifetime position one , and were downloaded on 2012 november 2 ( calcos version 2.18.5 ) .",
    "the full spectra for all ten green peas are shown in the appendix .      because the green peas are spatially resolved , the spectral resolution that we achieve is reduced from the 15 - 20 km s@xmath20 that is expected for point sources .",
    "nevertheless , figure [ ta_images ] shows that the galaxies are compact ; they do not fill the aperture , so the resolution should be better than the 200 km s@xmath20 that is reported for filled aperture observations @xcite .    in order to quantify the spectral resolution for the present sample , we create a model line spread function ( lsf ) from the nuv acquisition images and the point source lsf .",
    "for each galaxy , we create a one - dimensional profile in the dispersion direction , by summing the pixels in the cross dispersion direction of the acquisition image .",
    "this profile is then convolved with the lsf to estimate how it is broadened by spatially resolved emission .",
    "the resultant model lsfs in both g130 m and g160 m have typical fwhm @xmath42 pixels ( or 18 for the somewhat larger 1244 + 0216 ) at 1450 .",
    "this scale is larger than the 6 - 8 pixel fwhm of the point - source lsf , although both the point - source and model galaxy lsfs have wings extending beyond @xmath43 pixels . for a dispersion of 9.97 ( 12.23 ) m   pixel@xmath20 in g130 m ( g160 m )",
    ", the fwhm of the lsf corresponds to 25 ( 30 ) km s@xmath20 for typical green peas and 37 ( 46 ) km s@xmath20 for 1244 + 0216 . as will become evident in the later sections , the absorption lines are much broader and clearly spectrally resolved .",
    "the ly@xmath0  emission may have somewhat poorer spectral resolution if it is more extended than the stellar component .",
    "we chose to bin the spectra to gain signal - to - noise and mitigate the potential effects of correlated noise @xcite . as we showed above , the spectral resolution for our galaxies",
    "is degraded relative to our expectation for point sources .",
    "binning 20 native cos pixels into one does not discard information for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "therefore , we used the idl rebin function to calculate the mean of 20 adjacent fluxes , @xmath44 and wavelengths , @xmath32 .    inspection of the error arrays for the unbinned spectra showed that calcos overestimated the statistical uncertainties in the nine green peas observed in go 12928 , which have lower s / n than the spectrum of 0926 + 4427 .",
    "we measured the noise in line - free regions of these spectra , and found that it was around three times smaller than implied by the error vector .",
    "therefore , we re - calculated the error spectrum by taking the poisson noise on the observed counts in each 20 pixel bin , according to @xcite .",
    "the total counts per pixel were taken from the gcounts array in the one - dimensional cos spectrum , which includes both source and background counts . to convert the error on the counts to an error on the flux , we divide by the exposure time and the sensitivity function .",
    "the sensitivity function was simply estimated from the ratio of the calibrated and uncalibrated one - dimensional spectra ( the flux and net arrays provided by calcos ) .",
    "we verified that the newly derived error vector is a sensible representation of the noise in line - free portions of the continuum .",
    "moreover , this method applied to the higher s / n spectrum of 0926 + 4427 showed good agreement with the calcos error spectrum . for the sake of uniformity with the rest of the sample , we adopt the re - calculated error spectrum for this object .",
    "significant amounts of non - poissonian ( correlated ) noise have been noted in cos spectra @xcite , so we also test for this effect in our data . for this analysis",
    ", we repeated the spectral binning described above , creating spectra with @xmath45 3 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 100 , and 200 cos pixels averaged .",
    "we also include an unbinned spectrum to probe @xmath46 . in each spectrum , we subtracted a local continuum fit and measured the noise , @xmath47 , in regions that were free from strong absorption lines .",
    "in the case of the poisson limit , we expect the noise per bin to scale with the noise per single cos pixel @xmath48 , where @xmath49 . in reality",
    ", we measure @xmath50 to @xmath51 , close to the poisson limit .",
    "this contribution from non - poissonian noise is smaller than the contribution measured by keeney et al ; it does not impact our conclusions so we do not correct for it .      since we are interested in kinematic features probed by our cos spectra , it is important to assess the wavelength solution and velocity precision of our data .",
    "we make three tests .",
    "first , we check that the geocoronal ly@xmath0   1215.67 and @xmath52 lines lie at the correct observed wavelengths in the g130 m spectra . to make this comparison , we first remove the heliocentric velocity correction implemented by calcos .",
    "this step ensures that the geocoronal emission is in the rest - frame of the earth . after taking this correction into consideration ,",
    "the geocoronal emission features fall within -5 to + 17 km s@xmath20 of their expected velocities .",
    "the second test that we make is a comparison of the milky way ism absorption line velocities .",
    "because these lines may be doppler shifted , they do not test the zero - point accuracy of the wavelength scale .",
    "rather , their consistency gives a measure of the precision of our absorption line velocities .",
    "the features that we use for this comparison are the @xmath251190.4 , 1193.3 , @xmath321260.4 , and @xmath53 , as well as @xmath321334.5 , and @xmath54 .",
    "although higher ionization states are sometimes detected , we do not include these lines becuase they can have different kinematics than the low - ionization lines ( when observed in other galaxies , e.  g.  @xcite ) . from gaussian fits to the milky way lines , we find velocities that are consistent within 20 - 40 km s@xmath20 .    finally , we confirm that the systemic redshift of the stars in the green peas are consistent with the regions .",
    "redshifts measured from the photospheric 1175.5 line are compared to the redshifts that we measured from the sdss spectra ( table [ sample ] ) . in 8/10 galaxies , these redshifts agree to better than 41 km s@xmath20 ; for two others , the test is not possible : the line is undetected in 1219 + 1526 and it is contaminated by milky way absorption in 1137 + 3524 . nevertheless ,",
    "when measurable , the velocity offset between the regions and stars are consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "in summary , these tests show that we can measure velocities in the present cos fuv spectra to better than 40 km  s@xmath20 .",
    "this level of precision is confirmed for cos observations of ultra luminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "in emission , even though they were not selected to exhibit this feature .",
    "broad wings on the lines clearly extend to several hundred km s@xmath20 , and 9/10 show double - peaked emission . the profile of 1424 + 4217 is truncated at the red - cutoff of the g130 m spectrum ; for this object , the g160 m observation failed .",
    "the spectra are displayed in order of increasing @xmath55 ( left to right , top to bottom ) .",
    "[ lya_spec ] ]      figure [ lya_spec ] shows the ly@xmath0  spectra of the green peas in the present sample , displayed in order of increasing ly@xmath0  escape fraction ( estimated below ) .",
    "their appearance is remarkable , for a few reasons .",
    "first , all ten of the galaxies show ly@xmath0  in _ emission_. this result is not trivial ; typical star - forming galaxies at all redshifts show a range of ly@xmath0  strength , ranging from pure ( even damped ) absorption to p - cygni emission plus absorption , to pure emission @xcite . on the other hand , the green peas are not typical of nearby star - forming galaxies , so the ly@xmath0  emission seen in all ten galaxies is not entirely surprising .",
    "nearby , high equivalent width optical emission lines , like those in the green peas , have been suggested to favor ly@xmath0  emission @xcite .",

    "this added constraint , it turns out , is important since the lis and lyman series lines show somewhat different kinematics in their maximal outflow velocities . as we showed in figure [ fesc_vc ] , the lis metal lines reach maximal velocities around @xmath370 to @xmath371 km s@xmath20 , whereas the lyman series lines extend to between @xmath371 and @xmath180 km s@xmath20 .",

    "in our analysis so far , we have explored the role of ism and cgm gas in regulating the amount of ly@xmath0  emission that we observe from the green peas . in this section",
    "we will discuss the physical implications of our measurements .",
    "first , however , we summarize the findings from the previous sections :    1 .",
    "the `` green pea '' classification identifies objects with prominent ly@xmath0  emission and little to no ly@xmath0  absorption .",
    "nine of the ten galaxies in our sample have ly@xmath0  profiles that show both blue and red peaks , and unlike other low redshift samples , their ly@xmath0  luminosity and w@xmath6  reach the range probed by high redshift ly@xmath0  surveys ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   comparison to other nearby populations with published ly@xmath0  measurements @xcite , showed that the green peas have ( on average ) lower masses , higher sfrs and specific sfrs , brighter @xmath114 , bluer uv slopes , higher w@xmath12 , lower dust extinction , and smaller sizes .",
    "3 .   despite similarly low dust extinction in the green pea sample , we measure ly@xmath0  escape fractions ( within the cos aperture ) that span a factor of ten : @xmath378 .",
    "4 .   we detect lis absorption in 8/10 green peas , and confirm previous findings that weaker @xmath159 is associated with stronger ly@xmath0  emission ( e.  g.  @xcite ) , albeit , extending prior measurements to higher w@xmath6  and weaker @xmath159 .",
    "although the correlation between @xmath159 and w@xmath6  is not significant in our data , a tentative correlation is found when we use @xmath55 directly , instead of w@xmath6  as a proxy .",
    "furthermore , the robustness of this relation is also supported by detection in two independent measures : 1260  and 1334 . at the same time",
    ", we show that the equivalent width of @xmath321206 does not vary among the present sample .",
    "5 .   two of the ten green peas show no lis metal detections , and these are found among those with the highest ly@xmath0  escape fraction , @xmath379 , within the cos aperture .",
    "absorption in the lyman series ( @xmath2 , @xmath124 , @xmath122 and/or @xmath120 ) is detected in all ten green peas .",
    "unlike the lis metal lines , the absorption appears uniform in kinematics and equivalent width across the sample .",
    "furthermore , and in contrast to the lis metal lines , the lyman series lines are unambiguously saturated , with little to no residual intensity at line center .",
    "kinematic measurements from and show no correlation between @xmath55 and outflow velocities ( @xmath175 or @xmath374 ) in the lis metal lines , although two of the three highest @xmath55 green peas can not be included due to the absence of detectable lis absorption .",
    "the data do show a marginal correlation between @xmath55 and the outflow velocities ( @xmath175 and @xmath374 ) for , but because this line does not trace neutral hydrogen , this trend is not compelling evidence that scattering in the cool , neutral phase of the outflow is aiding ly@xmath0  escape . 8 .",
    "the ly@xmath0  escape fraction , @xmath55 , shows a significant anti - correlation with the velocity separation between the blue and red peaks , which is driven by shifts in the blue peak velocity .",
    "this trend is consistent with a changing neutral hydrogen column density , where lower density allows more ly@xmath0  to emerge near the systemic velocity .",
    "the velocity of the blue ly@xmath0  emission spans the same range of velocities as the absorption lines , demonstrating ( for the first time with ) that the ly@xmath0  emission arises from an envelope of gas spanning several hundred km s@xmath20 . at the same time , the maximal outflow velocities reached by the lyman series lines are consistently bluer than the maximum outflow velocities of the lis metal lines ; the good agreement between the velocities probed by blue ly@xmath0  emission and ly@xmath2/ly@xmath124 absorption implies that compared to lis metals , these lines are a better proxy for the gas that scatters ly@xmath0  photons .    these observations allow us to take a closer look at how the interstellar and circumgalactic gas regulates the escape of ly@xmath0  photons from the central few kpc of the green peas ( as probed by the cos aperture ) . in past studies , a few different ly@xmath0  escape mechanisms have been considered as possibly important . in the remainder of this section",
    "we take a comprehensive look at the present green pea data , and explore which ly@xmath0  escape models are consistent with our results .",
    "[ [ galaxy - outflow - kinematics ] ] galaxy outflow kinematics + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    galactic outflows are one mechanism for increasing the transmission of ly@xmath0  photons . in this case , the ly@xmath0  photons can scatter in gas , which is doppler shifted with respect to the ism .",
    "the scattered photons are then out of resonance with the ism and escape more easily .",
    "previous studies have noted this effect : @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show that ly@xmath0  emitting galaxies have outflow velocity @xmath380 to @xmath381 km s@xmath20 , while ly@xmath0  absorbing galaxies show no outflows ( lis absorption is near @xmath27 ) .",
    "on one hand , the green peas are consistent with these previous measurements ; all lis lines are measured with @xmath382 to @xmath381 km s@xmath20 , and all the green peas show ly@xmath0  emission . on the other hand , despite similar outflow velocities , the green peas show a factor of eight difference in the ly@xmath0  escape fraction ( @xmath383 ) . taken together with the previous studies ,",
    "these data suggest that outflows may be necessary to permit ly@xmath0  escape , but they are insufficient to explain the wide range of ly@xmath0  emission strengths . ultimately , more work is needed to clarify the role of outflows , and confirm that the relation between outflow velocity and ly@xmath0  escape is not secondary to some other physical characteristic like the ionization state or geometry of outflowing gas .

    "the motivation for this model is the correlation between w@xmath386 and w@xmath6 .",
    "since the lis metal lines appear saturated in composite spectra , but the absorption is not black , the interpretation is that this absorbing gas does not cover the entire galaxy .",
    "weaker w@xmath386 suggests lower @xmath385 in gas , resulting in greater @xmath55 .",

    "besides affecting our interpretation of ly@xmath0  escape , the addition of the lyman series lines requires that we re - evaluate our picture of how the cgm is structured around high - redshift galaxies .",
    "previous analyses of uv spectra support a model where saturated lis metal absorption arises from cool , dense clouds of gas entrained in a more highly ionized outflow @xcite . for the green peas ,",
    "the lis metal lines are difficult to interpret ; because of their low s / n , and the probable contribution from emission filling @xcite , we can not determine whether the lines are optically thin or optically thick .",
    "on one hand , if the lis metals from the green peas are optically thick , then the data require a density dependent covering fraction , @xmath385 .",
    "this scenario requires a pervasive low density , low ionization component surrounding higher density clumps ; only the latter give rise to detectable metal absorption . on the other hand ,",
    "the data could also be described by a homogeneous low density envelope of gas , which gives rise to optically thin lis metal absorption .",

    "three galaxies have serendipitous ly@xmath0  measurements that should approximate a `` total '' flux .",
    "the lars imaging showed that the cos aperture captured 40% of the flux of 0926 + 4427 @xcite , and galex grism spectra show that we detected 60 and 75% of the flux for 1133 + 6514 and 1219 + 1526 .",
    "intriguingly , for this small subsample , the fraction of ly@xmath0  flux detected by cos increases with @xmath55 . however ,",
    "an aperture correction alone still does not account for all of the ly@xmath0  photons produced in regions ; the small but significant amount of dust measured in  [ sample_sec ] is probably still important , especially when coupled with resonant scattering .",
    "systematic uncertainties on the absolute dust correction for ly@xmath0  preclude a full and accurate accounting of the flux .",
    "the emission and absorption line profiles in our uv spectra give another means for testing the significance of aperture effects .",
    "first , in a qualitative sense , aperture losses can mimic some of the features observed in our ly@xmath0  spectral profiles . for a spherically expanding shell",

    "consequently , including a greater contribution from these regions would increase the contribution from ly@xmath0  emission near the systemic velocity , while also increasing @xmath55 . at the same time , a greater contribution from spatially extended , scattered emission would also increase the amount emission from metals",
    ". this emission would both `` fill in '' the resonant si and c absorption lines in our data , and would also produce fluorescent * and * emission . in the absence of an aperture , and for a spherical geometry , we expect the equivalent widths of emission and absorption to sum to zero : @xmath391 @xcite .",
    "but if the finite cos aperture misses some of the scattering cgm gas , @xmath392 will be decreased @xcite . we tested whether and transitions in the present sample were consistent with @xmath391 , but found that this measurement is extremely sensitive to the precise placement of the continuum .",
    "because of the 10% normalization uncertainty appropriate for our data , we can not determine whether scattered and emission is missing from the cos aperture .    ultimately , direct detection of extended ly@xmath0  emission , similar to the approach adopted for the lars galaxies @xcite , is needed . such data",

    "this correlation is driven mostly by a shift in the blue emission peak , which appears closer to the systemic velocity when @xmath55 is high . since we see no correlation between @xmath55 and the outflow kinematics discussed in  [ kin_neutral_abs ] ,",
    "the kinematic trends seen in the ly@xmath0  lines more probably arise from a sequence in density .",
    "in fact , @xcite have already attributed small peak separations to low column densities . in this model ,",

    "hence , in the present sample , we attribute the increase in @xmath55 to a decrease in the neutral hydrogen density .",
    "it is plausible that decreased dust contents correspond with lower column density , but more sensitive dust measurements are needed to test this effect .",
    "finally , we note that variations in density may explain the correlation between @xmath55 and @xmath159 which we showed in  [ ewsec ] ; if the metal absorption arises from optically thin gas in a homogeneous envelope , the lower columns of neutral would also imply weaker lis absorption .",
