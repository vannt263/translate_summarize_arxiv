    "in the present work , we solve the discrepancy between pnj97 and pv98 by showing that the stddev of the pdf is not only a function of the rms mach number , but is also very sensitive to the relative importance of solenoidal ( divergence - free ) and compressive ( curl - free ) modes of the turbulence forcing , leading to variations in the stddev up to factors of @xmath0 for the same rms mach number .",
    "the main result of the present work is that the conclusions of pnj97 and pv98 can be harmonized , if we take into account that pnj97 have analyzed purely solenoidal forcing , whereas pv98 have studied purely compressive forcing .",

    "most of these studies have purely solenoidal forcing motivated by incompressible turbulence studies , some have weakly compressive forcing . the latter is a result of the natural ratio of solenoidal to compressible modes of a gaussian field prepared in fourier space without subsequent projection .",

    "accordingly , the ratio of compressive to the sum of compressive plus solenoidal modes is 1:3 in 3d and 1:2 in 2d .",
    "only pv98 have purely compressive forcing , because they analyze 1d simulations where no solenoidal component exists and the ratio of compressive to total modes is 1:1 .    the forcing is typically either modelled as a static pattern following the recipes by @xcite and @xcite , or by an ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process with finite autocorrelation timescale @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
