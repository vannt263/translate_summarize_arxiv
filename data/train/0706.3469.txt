    "coherent control @xcite is an approach to controlling quantum processes where the phase coherence between different quantum states is explicitly used in order to enhance or suppress a desired outcome of a given quantum event through interference effects . in the case of scattering ,",
    "control over the product cross sections has been shown to be achievable by creating a coherent superposition of incident scattering states @xcite . unlike the coherent control of unimolecular processes , which has been established both theoretically and experimentally @xcite , applications of coherent control to collisions is only in its infancy .",
    "hence it is important , at this early stage , to clarify and reinforce its essential principles , as well as to identify and develop qualitative pictures and insights applicable to a wide class of scattering problems , including the all - important case of reactive scattering .",
    "previous studies @xcite focusing on crossed beam scenarios at fixed total energy have identified necessary requirements for the coherent control of scattering events . in these stationary state scenarios , incident states consisting of coherent superpositions of internal and translational motions were considered . in general , due to the conservation of center - of - mass momentum and of energy during the collision , initial state entanglement between the internal and center - of - mass states of the incident beams was found to be required .",
    "here entanglement refers to the non - separability of the initial wave function when written in terms of the lab frame coordinates of the incident scattering particles .",
    "this requirement presents a considerable challenge to experimental implementation of the coherent control of scattering processes , and is partially responsible for the lack of coherent control scattering experiments thus far .",
    "the need for initial state entanglement in stationary state scenarios can be removed if superpositions of degenerate internal states are used@xcite .",
    "however , reliance upon such entanglement - exempt systems greatly restricts the choice of possible situations that can be used in the coherent control scenario .",
    "although the formalism leading to conditions for the coherent control of stationary state scattering is clear@xcite , the associated qualitative insight into the role of initial state entanglement is lacking . in this paper , we expose the universal configuration - based mechanism that lies at the core of such coherently controlled scattering @xcite .",
    "although our results are applicable to all scattering processes , we focus below on the most challenging case of reactive scattering .",
    "in particular , by analyzing the generic fixed total energy control scenarios where entangled interfering pathways are required , it is found that entanglement between the two incident beams ensures that _ all _ collisions within the scattering volume occur at a single favorable configuration of internal states .",
    "further , controlling the relative phases of the entangled interfering pathways is shown to shape the internal state wave function that participates in the scattering event .",
    "having identified this general mechanism , we extend this thinking to the time - dependent scattering regime , allowing us to introduce an alternate approach to controlled reactive scattering that uses non - entangled wave packets of translational motion .",
    "this approach relies on the observation that translational wave packets have a finite size , so that there is a finite volume of overlap in both space and time , defined by the scattering beams , wherein the collisions occur .",
    "if the internal configuration does not have time to change as the molecules move across the collision region , then a desired configuration can be established and maintained during the collision time , allowing coherent control of reactive scattering despite the absence of initial state entanglement .",
    "this method of control relies on the presence of temporal correlations in the incident state ( the collisions need to be precisely timed relative to the internal motion ) as opposed to initial state entanglement .    as a result of this work we have exposed the underlying qualitative mechanism for coherently controlled scattering and developed it within both stationary and non - stationary frameworks .",
    "each approach has its own challenges in experimental implementation , and each has its individual benefits .",
    "for example , the time - dependent wave packet version is perhaps conceptually and intuitively simpler , while the stationary state entangled version is not limited to scenarios with restricted collision volumes in space and/or time .    in the molecular scattering literature , it is frequently the case that one uses time - dependent ( i.e. wave - packet ) methods to calculate essentially time - independent scattering properties @xcite , such as energy - resolved cross sections . that usage of wave packets is intended solely as a computational convenience , and the same scattering results",
    "could have been computed using fully time - independent methods .",
    "we emphasize that , by contrast , the stationary and time - dependent scattering control schemes that we discuss do not simply refer to two different computational methodologies used to calculate the same physical scattering scenario .",
    "rather , the stationary and time - dependent control scenarios embody physically distinct extended coherence properties : one requires initial state entanglement while the other requires temporal correlations between the incident wave packet .",
    "similarly , the time dependent scheme introduced below does not just consist of simple shaping of a translational wavefunction incident on a single state of a target molecule . such a scenario would be akin to the previously studied 2pacc scenario@xcite which we have recently shown@xcite does not involve any aspect of quantum interference , and is hence not coherently controlled collision dynamics .",
    "rather , as shown below , our time dependent approach invokes specific interference effects to affect the product cross sections .    as a working example to illustrate these ideas , we consider electron impact dissociation of h@xmath0 , where the total dissociation cross section and energy spectrum of the ejected protons are the observables to be controlled",
    "however , it should be stressed that the arguments and conclusions to follow are completely general and could have been illustrated using any scattering example .",
    "similarly , none of our results relies on the use of the born approximation that is invoked below .",
    "however , the specific example of e - h@xmath0 collisions is focused upon since it is of central interest to the emerging field of strong field attosecond physics @xcite , where laser - induced ionization followed by electron recollision with the parent ion lie at the core of many processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ formalism ] provides a reformulation of controlled stationary state scattering which affords insight into the origin of conditions for control , and sect .",
    "[ ccreactive ] displays the underlying mechanism for control via computations on electron impact dissociation of h@xmath0 .",

    "this method is termed passive single - state control .    experimentally creating a single incident scattering eigenstate",
    "is not always an easy task .",

    "varying the temperature then changes the distribution of states that participate in the collision , and hence offers control .",
    "the thermal case can , of course , be identified as a particular case of scattering from an incoherent initial distribution , which in general leads to cross sections of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 defines the incoherent distribution of incident states .",
    "since all incoherent distributions provide averages over the single - state cross - sections , one can never achieve greater controllability using incoherent distributions than that achievable in single - state scattering .",

    "[ figwavepackets ] plots the minimum and maximum values of the cross section , which correspond to @xmath78 = 0 and @xmath101 , as the duration of the wave packet collision @xmath154 is increased .",
    "two different methods of increasing @xmath154 were explored .",
    "for the first method , @xmath157 is gradually made smaller and smaller , which causes the spatial size of the electron wave packet to increase and thereby increases @xmath154 .",
    "the control results using this technique , plotted against @xmath154 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ figwavepackets]c using the solid curves .",
    "the second method offsets the spatial and temporal focus of the electron wave packet relative to the ion wave packet @xmath158 where @xmath159 , and @xmath160 controls the focusing offset .",
    "the control results using this method are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figwavepackets]c with circles . in both cases",
    ", the control goes to zero as the @xmath154 approaches the vibrational period @xmath161 .",
    "these calculations most clearly demonstrate the configuration - based mechanism underlying the control ; the controllability decreases as more internal configurations participate in the collisional events .",
    "both the stationary state and non - stationary state control schemes present technological challenges .",
    "the wave packet case requires , experimentally , a collision over very short times , and therefore must be run in either a pulsed mode , or with very tightly focused molecular beams with small overlap region such that the molecules move through the collision region in a time smaller than the timescale characteristic of the dynamics of the internal superposition . the stationary state case , on the other hand , requires initial state entanglement , but can be used in a continuous beam regime and/or with arbitrarily large spatial region of overlap of the two beams .",
    "hence , the entangled version offers arbitrarily large space - time scattering volumes while spatial restrictions exist for the wave packet version .",
    "this implies that , although the cross sections may be controlled to the same degree , the entangled version will always permit larger total yields since it came be used in conjunction with arbitrarily large volumes and incident fluxes .",
    "a second advantage of the entangled scenario relates to the possibility of scattering resonances .",
    "the reactive cross section for e - h@xmath155 scattering is a rather smooth function of the incident relative momentum @xmath109 .",
    "hence , our sample cases thus far have implicitly considered the control of reactive scattering in the absence of sharp resonances related to the incident kinetic energy . however",
    ", reactive scattering problems of chemical interest may exhibit such resonances ( e.g. feshbach resonances ) .",
    "the pulsed wave packet scenario requires a broad superposition of incident momenta in order to obtain spatial localization and short - time overlaps of the two incident wave functions , while the entangled case can use as few as two incident momenta .",
    "it may very well be the case that narrow resonances can be resolved / exploited in the entangled case @xcite , while averaging over the broad momentum bandwidth in the wave packet case washes out the narrow resonance features , rendering them unusable in this latter scenario .",
    "note that both of these aspects of initial state entanglement , the possibility to efficiently exploit narrow resonances and access arbitrarily large scattering volumes , represent non - classical aspects of controlled reactive scattering accessible via entanglement .",
    "previous work on stationary state coherent control , which provides a useful description of crossed beam experiments , was shown to require initial state entanglement between the incident translational and the internal states of the scattering partners@xcite .",
    "this paper has provided physical insight into the role of this requirement , generating an extension to coherent control via time - dependent wave packet scattering .",
    "specifically , the initial state entanglement was shown to assure that _ all _ collisions occur at a fixed configuration of the internal state motion .",
    "this qualitative insight then allows for the introduction of a coherent control scenario in time - dependent scattering .",
    "control in the latter regime is possible if the duration of the wave packet collision is much smaller than the characteristic timescales of motion of the superposition of internal states .",
    "the mechanism of fixed - configuration scattering underlying coherent control of reactive scattering can be extended to all scattering scenarios . a sample extension to scattering off surfaces",
    "is provided elsewhere@xcite .",
    "some extensions of this approach are worth noting .",
    "first , scattering studies carried out on loosely bound van der waals complexes @xcite are distantly related to the wave packet control scenario . in these studies , a co@xmath162 @xmath163 hbr complex was used as an oriented precursor to study the co@xmath162 + h reaction , where photodissociation of hbr launched the h toward the co@xmath162 .",
    "these experiments are examples of the selection of well defined angular wave packets of the scattering partners . however , for active control of reactive scattering in these systems",
    ", one would also need to tune the particular angular wave packets that participate , as opposed to selecting the single orientation defined by the initial van der waals complex .",
    "this could perhaps be accomplished by selectively exciting rotational states of the co@xmath162 and/or hbr prior to the initiation of the reaction .",
    "second , although not explored in this paper , both the entangled and wave packet scenarios explored herein could be used instead to completely characterize the scattering matrix @xmath134 _ with phases _ , in analogy with methods of quantum process tomography @xcite . in short ,",
    "having selective control over the input internal state , in addition to the usual control over the input translational momenta , would allow one to measure enough projections of the scattering operators , through measurements of the scattering cross sections for different internal superpositions , to allow for an accurate reconstruction of the complex @xmath1-matrix .",
    "this work was support through a discovery grant from the national science and engineering research council ( nserc ) of canada .",
    "for both the strong field and field - free scenario , the transition matrix elements @xmath164 are required . in calculating these values",
    ", we use the lcao approximation for the bound electron@xcite .",
    "specifically , using a basis of definite energy and angular momentum for the final state of the internuclear coordinate @xmath165 and restricting the initial h@xmath0 to zero angular momentum gives @xmath166 where @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 ^ 2 }      \\times \\nonumber \\\\      \\int n^{(+)}(r ) n^{(-)}(r )   \\chi_{e , j}(r)j_l({\\tilde k}r/2 )      \\chi_\\nu(r ) dr.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the z - axis of the angular states lies along @xmath170 , and only the @xmath171 sub - levels along this axis have non - zero amplitude .",
