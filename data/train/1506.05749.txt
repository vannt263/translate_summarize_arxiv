    "active matter systems , defined as large assemblies of interacting particles consuming energy to self - propel , exhibit a variety of elaborate collective behaviors . among them , collective motion  a term referring to the coherent displacement of large groups of individuals over length scales much larger than their individual size  has played a leading role in active matter studies .",
    "it can be observed in a wide range of biological systems such as bird flocks  @xcite , fish schools  @xcite , bacterial swarms  @xcite , actin  @xcite or microtubule  @xcite motility assays , but also in inert matter that is artificially self - propelled , for example in assemblies of vibrated polar disks  @xcite , rolling colloids  @xcite or self - propelled liquid droplets  @xcite .    on the theoretical side , the transition to collective motion",
    " hereafter referred to as the `` flocking '' transition  has attracted the attention of the physics community because simple models have proved useful to describe its generic properties , highlighting the possibility of universal behaviours .",
    "the model introduced by vicsek and collaborators two decades ago  @xcite is prototypical of this line of research , containing only two ingredients : self - propulsion at a constant speed and aligning interactions .",
    "it has often been described as a dynamical xy model  @xcite since the alignment of the particle directions of motion resemble the ferromagnetic alignment of xy spins .",
    "the phenomenology of the vicsek model is now well established  @xcite .",
    "when decreasing the noise on the aligning interaction , or increasing the density , a transition takes place from a disordered gas into an ordered state of collective motion . between these two homogeneous phases",
    "lays a region of parameter space where particles gather in dense ordered bands travelling in a dilute disordered background .",
    "these bands , which are a robust feature of flocking models  @xcite , are a signature of the first - order nature of the transition , together with intermittency , metastability and hysteresis  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , they are seen only in large systems and strong finite size effects render the numerical study of the vicsek model ( vm ) very costly in computing power .    to overcome these numerical difficulties and gain more insight into the flocking transition ,",
    "a number of analytical approaches have been followed .",
    "hydrodynamic equations for vicsek - like models have been either derived by coarse - graining  @xcite or proposed phenomenologically  @xcite .",
    "these equations predict phase diagrams in qualitative agreement with the microscopic models , including the existence of inhomogeneous bands  @xcite .",
    "their analytical study is however so complicated that little can be done beyond working with their linearized version .",
    "nevertheless , some progress was made to account for the long range order and giant density fluctuations observed in the ordered phase of the vicsek model  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was also recently shown that all hydrodynamic equations derived for polar flocking models  @xcite admit the same family of 1d propagative solutions  @xcite .",
    "a complete analytical study of the vicsek model , from micro to macro , however remains elusive .    an alternative strategy to gain insight into the flocking transition relied on the introduction of an active ising model ( aim )  @xcite which circumvents both the numerical and analytical pitfalls of the vicsek model .",
    "using non - equilibrium versions of ferromagnetic models has indeed often proven a useful strategy  @xcite .",
    "the aim , which we study in detail in this paper , contains the two key ingredients for flocking : self - propulsion and aligning interactions .",
    "the continuous rotational symmetry of the vicsek model is however replaced by a discrete symmetry ; in the aim , particles diffuse in the 2d plane but are self - propelled in only one of two possible directions ( left or right ) .",
    "it is thus akin to a dynamical ising model where particles have a discrete rotational symmetry .",
    "the aim is found to have a simpler , more tractable , behavior than the vicsek - like models with continuous symmetry while still retaining a large part of their physics . using a lattice - based model",
    "also simplifies both numerical and analytical studies .    after introducing the model in section  [ sec : def ] ,",
    "we present a numerical study of the 2d aim in section  [ sec : phase_diagrams ] .",
    "our main conclusion is that the transition in the aim amounts to a liquid - gas transition in the canonical ensemble . at fixed orientational noise ,",
    "the system can be in two `` pure '' states : a disordered gas or an ordered liquid , the latter leading to a collective migration of all particles to the left or to the right . when constraining the system s density to lie between two spinodal lines , no homogeneous phase can be observed and the system phase - separates , with an ordered travelling liquid band coexisting with a disordered gas background .",
    "a key difference with the usual equilibrium liquid - gas transition is that liquid and gas have different symmetries ; a supercritical region is thus prohibited since one has to break a symmetry to take the system from a gas to a liquid state , which explains the atypical shape of the phase diagram .    in section  [ sec :",
    "hydro ] , we complement our numerical approach by deriving a set of hydrodynamic equations for the dynamics of the local density and magnetisation fields . interestingly , a simple mean - field theory wrongly predicts a continuous transition , failing to account for the phase - separated profiles .",
    "a refined mean - field model , taking into account the fluctuations of the density and magnetisation fields , reproduces qualitatively the phenomenology of the aim . in section  [ sec : fronts ] , we use the hydrodynamic equations to compute at large densities the shape of the phase - separated profiles , the coexisting densities , the velocity of the liquid domain and account for the finite - size scalings observed in the microscopic model .",
    "finally , we argue in section  [ sec : robustness ] in favor of the robustness of our results by considering an off - lattice version of the model and different boundary conditions .     in both directions .",
    "we consider @xmath0 particles moving on a 2d lattice of @xmath1 sites with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each particle carries a spin @xmath2 and there are no excluded volume interactions between the particles : there can thus be an arbitrary number @xmath3 of particles with spins @xmath2 on each site @xmath4 .",
    "the local densities and magnetizations are then defined as @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we consider a continuous - time markov process in which particles can both flip their spins and hop to neighboring lattice sites at rates that depend on their spins ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rates ] ) .",
    "the hopping and flipping rates , detailed in the next subsections , are such that our model is endowed with self - propulsion and inter - particle alignment , hence consituting a flocking model with discrete symmetry .",
    "a particle with spin @xmath7 on site @xmath8 flips its spin at rate @xmath9 where @xmath10 plays the role of an inverse temperature .",
    "these rates satisfy detailed balance with respect to an equilibrium distribution @xmath11 $ ] where @xmath12 is the sum over the @xmath13 lattice sites of the hamiltonians of fully connected ising models : @xmath14\\ ] ] the first sum runs over the lattice site index @xmath15 , the next two over the particles @xmath16 present on site @xmath8 , and @xmath17 is the value of spin @xmath18 .",
    "( the factor @xmath19 simply avoids double counting . ) the rate @xmath20 can always be absorbed in a change of time unit so that we take @xmath21 , silently omitting it from now on .",
    "this interaction is purely local : particles only align with other particles on the same site and , without particle hopping , the model amounts to @xmath22 independent fully connected ising models .",
    "the factor @xmath23 in @xmath24 makes the hamiltonian @xmath12 extensive with @xmath0 and keeps the interaction rates bounded : the rate @xmath25 at which a particle of spin @xmath7 flips its spin varies between @xmath26 if all the other particles on the same site have spins @xmath7 to @xmath27 $ ] if they all have spins @xmath28 .    .",
    "the numbers associated to the arrows are the transition rates for @xmath29 .",
    "the product of the transition rates along @xmath30 ( left to right ) is @xmath31 , whereas the reverse order ( right to left ) yields @xmath32 . ]    , @xmath33 .",

    "( d ) 2d snapshot corresponding to ( c ) .",
    "( for all figures @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) ]      particles also undergo free diffusion on the lattice , with a left / right bias depending on the sign of their spins : a particle with spin @xmath7 hops with rate @xmath40 to its right , @xmath41 to its left , and @xmath42 in both the up and down directions .",
    "there is thus a mean drift , which plays the role of self - propulsion , with particles of spins @xmath43 moving along the horizontal axis with an average velocity @xmath44 .",
    "the model is designed to have the self - propulsion entering in a minimal and tunable way through the parameter @xmath45 .",
    "importantly , the limit of vanishing self - propulsion @xmath46 is well - defined because the spins still diffuse on the lattice .",
    "this dynamics should thus allow us to interpole continuously between ` totally self - propelled ' ( @xmath47 ) , self - propelled ( @xmath480,1[$ ] ) , weakly self - propelled ( @xmath49 ) and purely diffusive @xmath50 particles .",
    "this differs from the vicsek model where the zero - velocity limit corresponds to immobile particles undergoing an equilibrium dynamics resembling that of the xy model , with a quenched disorder on the bonds ( only particles closer than a fixed distance interact ) .",
    "let us note , however , that even when @xmath29 the model is not at equilibrium _",
    "i.e. _ it does not satisfy detailed balance with respect to any distribution .",
    "this is easily shown using kolmogorov s criterion  @xcite . in fig .",

    "the steady - state distribution would however be factorized and not very interesting .",
    "an alternative would be to further add to   nearest neighbours interactions but we have not followed this cumbersome path here .",

    ", we used a random - sequential - update algorithm .",
    "we discretized the time in small time - steps @xmath52 .",
    "a particle is then chosen at random ; it flips its spin @xmath7 with probability @xmath53 , hops upwards or downwards with probabilities @xmath54 , to its right or to its left neighboring sites with probabilities @xmath55 . finally , it does nothing with probability @xmath56\\delta t$ ] .",
    "time is then incremented by @xmath57 and we iterate up to some final time . in practice",
    "we used @xmath58^{-1}$ ] to minimize the probability that nothing happens while keeping all probabilities smaller than one .",
    "note that this algorithm does not allow a particle to be updated twice ( on average ) during @xmath52 and is thus an approximation of our continuous - time markov process .",
    "we also used continuous - time simulations , associating clocks to each particle or each site and pulling updating times from the corresponding exponential laws . in practice",
    "we did not find any difference in the simulation results but the continuous time simulations were often slower so that we mostly used the random sequential update algorithm .    in most of this article we use simulation boxes with @xmath1 lattice sites and periodic boundary conditions .",

    "we explored the phase diagram using three control parameters : the temperature @xmath62 , the average density @xmath63 , and the self - propulsion ` speed ' @xmath45 . doing so , we observed three different phases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] . for @xmath64 , at high temperatures and low densities , the particles fail to organize and we observe a homogeneous gas of particles with local magnetization @xmath65 . on the contrary , for large densities and small temperatures ,",

    "[ fig : profiles_micro ] , for all phase - separated profiles at fixed @xmath70 , the densities in the gas and liquid part of the profiles are @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , the magnetization are @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "thus , varying the density @xmath60 at constant temperature and propulsion speed solely changes the width of the liquid band .",
    "consequently , in the phase coexistence region , the lever rule can be used to determine the liquid fraction @xmath75 in the same way as for an equilibrium liquid - gas phase transition in the canonical ensemble : @xmath76 as we shall see below , this analogy goes beyond the sole shape of the phase - separated profiles and the phase - transition to collective motion of the active ising model is best described as a liquid - gas phase transition rather than an order - disorder one .",
    "the phase diagram in the ( @xmath77 , @xmath60 ) parameter plane , computed for @xmath39 , is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagrams ] .",
    "while the general structure of the phase diagram , with a gas phase , a liquid phase , and a coexistence region , is reminiscent of an equilibrium liquid - gas phase diagram , the shapes of the transition lines are unusual .",
    "this difference can be understood using a symmetry argument . since the disordered gas and the polar liquid have different symmetries , the system can not continuously transform from one homogeneous phase to the other without crossing a transition line .",
    "there is thus no super - critical region and the critical point is sent to @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : passive_active_liquidgas ] for a schematic picture . )",
    "this symmetry argument should be rather general for flocking transitions separating a disordered state and a symmetry - broken state of collective motion .",
    "indeed , in vicsek - like models , where the role of the inverse temperature is played by the noise intensity , the phase diagrams are qualitatively similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagrams ] .",
    "this is true both for the full phase diagram recently computed in  @xcite as well as for earlier results  @xcite , for a slightly different kinetic model and its hydrodynamic theory  @xcite , but also for an active nematic vicsek - like model  @xcite and a hydrodynamic theory of self - propelled rods  @xcite .",
    "conversely , one can change the strength of the self - propulsion @xmath45 while keeping the temperature fixed . again , one obtains a phase diagram with three regions .",
    "the difference with the canonical ensemble is that in this parameter plane , the two coexistence lines merge at @xmath29 , where self - propulsion vanishes , yielding a critical point at a finite density @xmath80 ( see the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagrams ] ) .",

    "[ fig : phase_diagrams ] and satisfies @xmath81 $ ] . in section  [ sec : eps0cp ] we show that this critical point belongs to the ising universality class .",
    "the shape of this phase diagram is identical to the one computed in  @xcite for a phenomenological hydrodynamic description of self - propelled particles with polar alignment .",
    "the comparison with other microscopic models in the literature is however hard to make since there seems to be very few studies in the @xmath82 plane , probably because very few models admit a well - defined zero velocity limit .      as for an equilibrium liquid - gas transition ,",
    "the coexistence lines @xmath83 and @xmath84 are complemented by spinodal lines @xmath85 and @xmath86 that mark the limit of linear stability of the homogeneous gas and liquid phases , respectively . while @xmath71 and @xmath72 are easily measured in simulations , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are much harder to access numerically at non - zero temperature : when the system is in the coexistence region but outside the putative spinodal lines , the homogeneous phases are metastable and finite fluctuations make the system phase - separate .",
    "the closer to the spinodal line , the faster this nucleation occurs and it is then difficult to pinpoint precisely the transition from a ` fast ' nucleation to a spinodal decomposition .",
    "nevertheless , the differences between the coexistence and spinodal regions are clearly seen when , starting from a homogeneous phase , one quenches the system in the coexistence region but relatively far away from the spinodal lines .",
    "quenching outside the spinodal region , the homogeneous phases are metastable .",
    "the closer to the binodals , the longer it takes for a liquid ( resp .",
    "gas ) domain to be nucleated in the gas ( resp .",
    "liquid ) background .",

    "see supplementary movies in  @xcite . ]",
    "quenching inside the spinodal region , the different symmetries between gas and liquid result in different spinodal decomposition dynamics when starting from ordered and disordered phases .",
    "starting from a disordered gas , the linear instability almost immediately results in the formation of an extensive number of small clusters of negative and positive spins .",
    "the coarsening then stems from the merging of these clusters , until a single , macroscopic domain remains .",
    "the late stage of the coarsening is thus dominated by the long - lived competition between a small number of right- and left - moving macroscopic clusters .",
    "their shapes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : quench_snap_late ] ) are reminiscent of the counter - propagating arrays of bands reported in  @xcite , where it was suggested , using deterministic simulations of the boltzmann equation derived for kinetic flocking models , that such profiles could constitute a new phase of flocking models . in our simulations , we always observed a coarsening process leading to a single band , which seems to indicate that the apparent stability of these solutions in  @xcite could be due to the lack of fluctuation terms .",
    "it would nevertheless be interesting to make a more detailed study of the coarsening dynamics to see if these alternating bands could indeed form a stable phase ( for instance at low temperatures , where the coarsening seems to become slower and slower ) .     at time @xmath90",

    "starting from the ordered phase , the linear instability results in many liquid domains which all move in the same direction .",

    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : quench_snap ] and si movies  @xcite for examples of these four possible dynamics .",
    "another similarity with a liquid - gas transition is the presence of hysteresis loops obtained by varying slowly the density at constant @xmath93 and @xmath45 in finite - size systems .",

    "the results are very similar to those obtained in  @xcite but first   is faster to measure and second it does not rely on an arbitrary density treshold .",

    "the system jumps to a homogeneous liquid phase with @xmath102 .    upon decreasing the density ,",
    "a similar scenario occurs : a homogeneous liquid becomes metastable as the coexistence line is crossed . as the density keeps decreasing , the system thus remains in a liquid state with @xmath103 until a nucleation event brings it to a phase - separated profile .",

    "the phenomenology of this model is very similar to that of the aim ; its phase diagram in the temperature - density ensemble shows the same three regions , with an asymptote at @xmath124 as @xmath335 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : off - lattice ] , left ) .",
    "as in the lattice model , only the liquid fraction changes when @xmath60 is increased at fixed temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : off - lattice ]  ( right ) .",
    "in this paper we have characterized in detail the transition to collective motion in the 2d active ising model . for any temperature @xmath210 and self - propulsion velocity @xmath336",
    ", there is a finite density range for which the system phase - separates into a polar liquid and a disordered gas .",
    "the densities at coexistence do not depend on @xmath77 or @xmath196 so that changing the average density only changes the liquid fraction .",
    "this is one of the many characteristics shared by the flocking transition of the aim with the equilibrium liquid / gas transition in the canonical ensemble .",
    "others include metastability , hysteresis , and the existence of critical nuclei .",
    "more generally , this analogy suggests that the flocking transition should be seen as a phase - separation transition rather than an order - disorder transition .",
    "the fact that the liquid phase is ordered however plays a major role by forbidding a supercritical region , which explains the atypical shape of the phase diagram .    to construct a continuous theory for our model we first noticed that one needs to go beyond a standard mean - field approach .",
    "the latter indeed fails to capture the phase separation behavior because it lacks a density dependence of the transition temperature . retaining part of the fluctuations neglected at the mean - field level then allowed us to derive a refined - mean - field model which accounts for the behavior of the microscopic model qualitatively for all parameter values .",
    "the analytical solution for the phase - separated profile that we derived in sec .  [ sec : fronts ] is only one of a two - parameter family of solutions , as shown in  @xcite . although it is the sole propagating solution accounting for phase separation , the mecanism by which it is selected remains to be investigated",
    "this is particularly interesting since , as shown in  @xcite , most of the picture laid out for the aim remains valid for the vicsek model , apart from the shape of the bands in the phase separated region .",
    "the full phase separation of the aim is then replaced by a micro - phase separation , something which can not be explained at the hydrodynamic level and necessit explicit noise terms .    beyond the sole case of the aim",
    ", we showed that our results are also valid off lattice .",
    "we can thus consider the aim as a representative example of a flocking model with discrete rotational symmetry .",
    "variants with alignment between nearest neighbours , and not simply on - site , also yield similar results .",
    "our study of the aim relies on numerical simulations , microscopic derivation and study of hydrodynamic equations .",
    "it says little about the universality of the emerging properties of the active ising model and we strongly believe that developing proper field theoretical approaches of the aim and more general active spin models could shed light on a number of interesting questions .",
    "for instance , is the @xmath131 limit of the aim in the universality class of model c  @xcite , which couples a conserved diffusive field and a non - conserved @xmath202 theory ?",
    "then , can one study the divergence of the correlation length of the aim when approaching the @xmath211 and @xmath258 critical points ?",
    "what are the corresponding universality classes ? these questions will be addressed in future works .",
    "last , the analogy of the phase transition in the aim with an equilibrium liquid / gas transition triggers new questions .",
    "for example , could we define a mapping , at some level , with an equilibrium system ? and would it be possible to change ensemble in this non - equilibrium system , for example desining a grand - canonical ensemble ? these questions ,",
    "if answered , would certainly improve our theoretical understanding of active matter systems .",
    "we thank the kavli institute for theoretical physics , santa barbara , usa , and the galileo galilei institute , firenze , italy for hositality and financial support .",
    "this research was supported by the anr bactterns project and , in part , by the national science foundation under grant no .",
    "nsf phy11 - 25915 .",
    "as shown in section  [ sec : mf ] , the mean - field equations , which neglect all fluctuations and correlations , fail to describe the active ising model since they predict a continuous phase transition between homogeneous phases . in this appendix",
    "we show how one can improve the mean - field approximation .",
    "to do so , we take into account the fluctuations of the local magnetisations and densities when computing the dynamics of their first moments @xmath337 and @xmath338 .      the simplest assumption that can be made about the fluctuations of @xmath172 and",
    "@xmath171 around their mean values , @xmath339 and @xmath340 , is that they are gaussian . for @xmath172 ,",
    "this can be seen as resulting from a central limit theorem : in a first approximation , the magnetisation is the sum of many spins fluctuating independently and , indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : approx_mf_distribs ] shows its fluctuations to be well described by a gaussian . on the contrary ,",
    "the distribution of the local density is not perfectly gaussian , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : approx_mf_distribs ] .",
    "a better approximation could be obtained by considering a poisson distribution but , as will be apparent in the following , the first correction to mean - field comes from the fluctuations of @xmath197 so this would not improve our approximation .",
    "furthermore we believe that , to improve our refined mean - field model , the next step should be to include the correlations between @xmath198 and @xmath197 , that we neglect in the following , and not higher cumulants of the distributions of @xmath198 and @xmath197 .    more formally , the probability to observe a magnetisation @xmath197 and a density @xmath198 at time @xmath341 and position @xmath342 given initial profiles @xmath343 and @xmath344 are assumed to be given by @xmath345 where @xmath237 is the normal distribution and @xmath223 and @xmath224 are the average value of the density and magnetisation fields .",
    "we further assume that the variances of the gaussian distributions scales linearly with the local density : @xmath346 and @xmath347 .",
    "again , the underlying assumption is that the fluctuations of the fields @xmath171 and @xmath172 arise from the sum of @xmath198 independent contributions . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : approx_mf_variance ] this is a rather good approximation in the gas phase , close to the critical point at @xmath124 , @xmath276 .     for different densities .",
    "@xmath348 is the gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath349 . ]    , @xmath39 , @xmath349 . ]      in deriving hydrodynamic equations from eq .   and , the only terms that have to be approximated are the non - linear contributions of the aligning interactions : @xmath350 where @xmath351    using the assumption",
    ", we can compute @xmath352 as a sum of gaussian integrals which can all be evaluated by saddle - point approximation in the limit of large @xmath231 .",
    "we first notice that , since we neglect the correlations between @xmath198 and @xmath197 , @xmath353 to compute @xmath354 , we first change variables to @xmath355 so that @xmath356 we then expand in powers of @xmath357 and compute the corresponding gaussian integrals @xmath358    let us now evaluate the terms @xmath359 .",
    "first , the integral @xmath360 is divergent because of the @xmath361 lower limit .",
    "this is a simple discretisation problem which can be bypassed by introducing a cut - off @xmath362 at small density . for large @xmath231",
    ", the integrals will be dominated by large values of @xmath198 so this cut - off does not play any role in the following . changing variable to @xmath363 , we find @xmath364 this integral can now be approximated by an asymptotic saddle - point expansion . in the limit of large @xmath231 ,",
    "the integral is dominated by @xmath365 .",
    "the lower limit of the integral @xmath366 can thus be extended to @xmath367 harmlessly and one can expand @xmath368 to get the asymptotic expansion @xmath369 all the odd contributions vanish by symmetry . changing variable to @xmath370 ,",

    "expanding to higher orders is not sufficient to get a _",
    "quantitative _ agreement between microscopic simulations and our refined mean - field model , probably because the most important correction to   would involve correlations between @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "as we show in section  [ sec : hydro ] , however , this first correction to mean - field is sufficient to capture the physics of the model .",
    "the mean - field and refined mean - field equations read @xmath382 where @xmath383 and @xmath384 for the mean - field equations .",
    "these equations admit three steady homogeneous solutions @xmath385 , @xmath386 . a disordered solution with @xmath387 that exists for all @xmath60 and @xmath93 , and",
    "two ordered solutions @xmath388 that exist only when @xmath389 .",
    "let us consider a small perturbation around the disordered profile , @xmath390 , @xmath391 .",

    "the eigenvalues of the 2x2 matrix are @xmath395 the profile is linearly unstable if one of these eigenvalues has a positive real part . clearly , the sign of @xmath396 controls the stability : the disordered profile is unstable to long wavelength perturbations when @xmath207 and @xmath397 and stable otherwise .",

    "linearizing the dynamics of a small perturbation around the ordered profile @xmath398 , @xmath399 gives @xmath400 and the eigenvalues now read @xmath401 equation   shows @xmath402 to have a purely stabilizing effect ; taking @xmath403 thus does not affect the conclusions about the stability of the system",

    "[ fig : linear_stability ] ) that for small but positive @xmath396 , @xmath405 at long wave - length .",
    "the value of @xmath396 at which the system becomes stable can be determined analytically as the point where @xmath406 changes sign ( the first derivative being zero at @xmath407 ) .",
