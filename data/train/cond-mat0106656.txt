    "quantum dots ( qds ) are characterised by relatively small number of electrons confined within an island with a nanometer dimension .",
    "they can confine the motion of an electron in all three spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the strong confinement in the qd gives rise to a set of discrete and narrow electronic energy levels similar to those in atomic physics .",
    "the epitaxial growth of lattice mismatched @xmath0 on @xmath1 or @xmath2 opens new possibilities for the simple fabrication of semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "@xmath0 qds are formed _ in situ _ during growth due to the relaxation of a strained @xmath0 wetting layer on @xmath1 or @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the particular interest lies in their uniformity and small size : a lateral dimension @xmath3 and height @xmath4 nm .",
    "several theoretical approaches have been used to calculate the eigenstates of @xmath0 qds  @xcite .",
    "the results of the calculation depend strongly on the assumed shape and composition of the qds .",
    "experimentally , the quantized energy levels of a given potential can be probed using various spectroscopic techniques .",
    "the corresponding wave functions are much more difficult to measure .",
    "information about the extent of the carrier wavefunction for the ground state of a qd was obtained from tunneling measurements in a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "also , the anisotropy of electronic wave function in self - aligned @xmath0 qds was deduced from magnetic - field - dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy  @xcite . however , until recently there have been no reported measurements of the detailed spatial form of the wavefunctions of the ground and excited states of the qd .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that magnetotunneling spectroscopy can be employed as nonivasive probe to produce images of the probability density of the electron confined in a qd  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we use magnetotunneling spectroscopy ( mts ) to investigate in detail of the spatial form of the wave function of the electron states of a double - barrier resonant tunnelling diode with @xmath0 qds embedded in the centre of a @xmath1 quantum well .",
    "we measure the dependence of the resonant tunnelling current through the qd states as a function of magnetic field , b , applied perpendicular to the tunnelling direction .",
    "this allows us to map out the full spatial form of the probability density of the ground and excited states of the qds .",
    "the electron wavefunctions have a biaxial symmetry in the growth plane , with axes corresponding quite closely ( within measurement error of 15@xmath5 ) to the main crystallographic directions @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] for ( 311)b substrate orientation .",
    "for a similar @xmath0 qd structure grown on a ( 100)-substrate we also obtained characteristic probability density maps of ground and exited states .",
    "the @xmath0 qds are embedded in a @xmath8 , resonant tunnelling diode .",
    "the samples were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a @xmath1 substrate with the orientations ( 100 ) and ( 311)b .",
    "a layer of @xmath0 qds , nominally @xmath9 monolayer thick , was placed in the centre of a @xmath10 wide @xmath1 quantum well ( qw ) with @xmath11 @xmath12 confining barriers , sandwiched between two nominally - undoped @xmath13 @xmath1 spacer layers .",
    "the intrinsic region is surrounded by graded n - type contact layers , with the doping concentration increasing from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "the layers were grown at 600@xmath5 c , and there was a growth interrupt before the qds were grown at 480 @xmath5c . for comparison",
    ", we also studied two control samples grown with the same sequence of layers , except one has only a thin @xmath0 two - dimensional wetting layer ( i.e. containing no qds ) and the other has no @xmath0 layer at all .",
    "the samples were processed into circular mesa structures of diameters between @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with ohmic contacts to the doped regions .",
    "figure 1 shows a schematic energy band diagram for our device under bias voltage .",
    "x and y define the two main crystallographic axis in the plane perpendicular to growth direction , z ( see inset ) .",
    "the layer of @xmath0 qds introduces a set of discrete electronic states below the @xmath1 conduction band edge . at zero bias voltage",
    ", equilibrium is established by electrons diffusing from the doped @xmath1 layers and filling some dot states .",
    "the resulting negative charge in the qw produces depletion layers in the regions beyond the ( alga)as barriers . by applying a bias voltage to the emitter layer , v ,",
    "the qd energy level is shifted in energy with respect to both contacts .",
    "when a particular dot state is resonant with an adjacent filled state in the biased electron emitter layer , electrons tunnel through the dot into the collector and a current flows as shown schematically in fig.1 .",
    "therefore , as we adjust the voltage we can study different energy states of the qds . at sufficiently high voltages we are able to observe two separate resonances in the current related to confined subbands of the qw states .",
    "figure 2 shows a typical low - temperature ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19 curve .",
    "the device contains @xmath0 qds grown on a ( 311)b - oriented @xmath1 substrate .",
    "similar were obtained for qds grown on a ( 100)-substrate .",
    "we observe a series of resonant peaks corresponding to carrier tunnelling into the dot states .",
    "pronounced current features appear at biases as low bias as 55 mv .",
    "they are superimposed on a rising background current and can not be resolved for @xmath20 .",
    "these features are not observed in our control samples which do not contain qds and are thereforewe can ascribe them to the @xmath0 qd layer . despite the large number of quantum dots in our sample ( @xmath21 for a @xmath22 diameter mesa )",
    ", we observed only a small number of resonant peaks over the bias range ( @xmath23 ) close to the threshold for current flow .",
    "this behaviour has been reported in earlier studies  @xcite and , although not fully understood , is probably related to the limited number of conducting channels in the emitter that can transmit electrons from the doping layer to the quantum dots at low bias .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the dots studied are atypical of the distribution as a whole . on increasing the temperature to @xmath24 , the main peaks are still prominent , but much weaker features , which may be related to density - of - state fluctuation in the emitter  @xcite , are strongly suppressed .",
    "a key observation is that many peaks look similar so we can not tell if the peaks are due to tunneling through the states of a single dot or several dots . in the following ,",
    "we will concentrate on three voltage regions labelled ( `` a '' ) , ( `` b '' ) and ( `` c '' ) .",
    "we will focus on the magnetic field dependence of the qd resonances and on how this provides detailed information about the form of the wavefunction associated with an electron in the qd state .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the low - temperature ( @xmath25 ) @xmath19 characteristics in the presence of a magnetic field , @xmath26 .",
    "the direction of @xmath26 is perpendicular to the current flow and lies in the ( x , y ) plane ( see fig 1 ) . the axis @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath28 $ ] define the two main crystallographic axis in the plane perpendicular to growth direction [ 311 ] .",
    "the amplitude of each resonance exhibits a strong dependence on the intensity of @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , with increasing @xmath26 , the low - voltage resonances `` a '' decrease steadily in amplitude , whereas the others , `` b '' and `` c '' , have a non- monotonic magnetic field dependence . the figure 3(b ) and",
    "( c ) show clearly two characteristic types of magnetic field dependence : type `` a '' shows a maximum on g(b ) at b = 0 t followed by a steady decay to zero at around @xmath29 ; type `` b '' shows a broad maximum at @xmath30 @xmath31 , followed by a gradual decay to zero .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the @xmath19 characteristics in an in - plane magnetic field of @xmath31 .",
    "the first curve ( circles ) is for @xmath32 $ ] ; the second curve ( triangles ) is for @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "we observe a clear anisotropy in the dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath26 for the two field orientations .",
    "as can be clearly seen in fig.4(a ) peaks `` a '' and `` b '' in the @xmath19 plot reveal a strong anisotropy of about @xmath34 0.5 .",
    "we have also determined angular dependence of the peaks .",
    "the results are plotted in fig.4(b ) for peaks `` a '' and `` b '' .",
    "note that all peaks , observed over the bias range ( @xmath35200 mv ) have a maxima in current amplitude at orientation of a field @xmath32 $ ] or @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the main effect to be noted from fig.4 is the dependence of the current as a function of the in - plane magnetic field orientation .",
    "we can understand the magnetic field dependence of the features in terms of the effect of @xmath26 on a tunnelling electron .",
    "let @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 indicate , respectively , the direction of @xmath26 , the direction normal to @xmath26 in the growth plane @xmath39 , and the normal to the tunnel barrier , respectively ( see figure 1 ( b ) ) .",
    "when an electron tunnels from the emitter into the dot , it acquires an additional in - plane momentum given by  @xcite    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the effective distance tunnelled along @xmath38 .",
    "this effect can be understood semiclassically in terms of the increased momentum along @xmath42 , which is acquired by the tunnelling electron due to the action of the lorentz force . in terms of mapping out the spatial form of an electronic state",
    ", we can envisage the effect of this shift in as analogous to that of the displacement , in real space , of the atomic tip in a stm imaging measurement .",
    "the applied voltage allows us to tune resonantly to the energy of a particular qd state .",
    "then , by measuring the variation of the tunnel current with @xmath26 , we can determine the size of the matrix element that governs the quantum transition of an electron as it tunnels from a state in the emitter layer into a qd .",
    "in our experiment , the tunnelling matrix element is most conveniently expressed in terms of the fourier transforms @xmath43 of the conventional real space wavefunctions  @xcite . here",
    "the subscripts @xmath44 and @xmath45 indicate the initial ( emitter ) and final ( qd ) states of the tunnel transition .",
    "relative to the strong spatial confinement in the qd , the initial emitter state has only weak spatial confinement .",
    "hence , in -space corresponds to a sharply peaked function with a finite value only close to = 0 . since the tunnel current is given by the square of the matrix element involving @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the narrow spread of for @xmath46 allows us to determine the form of @xmath47 by varying @xmath26 and hence according to ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "thus by plotting @xmath48 for a _",
    "particular _ direction of @xmath26 we can measure the dependence of @xmath49 along the -direction perpendicular to @xmath26 .",
    "then , by rotating @xmath26 in the plane ( x , y ) and making a series of measurements of @xmath50 with @xmath26 set at regular intervals ( @xmath51 5@xmath5 ) of the rotation angle @xmath52 , we obtain a full spatial profile of @xmath53 .",
    "this represents the projection in -space of the probability density of a given electronic state confined in the qd .",
    "the model provides a simple explanation of the magnetic field dependence of the resonant current features `` a - c '' . in particular , the _ forbidden _ nature of the tunnelling transition associated with `` b '' at @xmath54 is due to the odd parity of the final state wavefunction , which corresponds to the first excited state of a qd .",
    "the applied magnetic field ( i.e. the lorentz force ) effectively breaks the mirror symmetry at @xmath55 and thus makes the transition _",
    "allowed_.    figure 5 shows the spatial form of @xmath56 , in the plane @xmath57 for the two representative qd states corresponding to the labelled features in fig.3(b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the -values are estimated from relation ( 1 ) , assuming @xmath41 has nominal value of @xmath58  nm which we estimate from capacitance measurements and from the doping profile and composition of the device .",
    "the contour plots reveal clearly the characteristic form of the probability density distribution of a ground state orbital and the characteristic lobes of the higher energy states of the qd .",
    "the electron wavefunctions have a biaxial symmetry in the growth plane , with axes corresponding quite closely ( within measurement error of 15@xmath59 ) to the main crystallographic directions @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] for ( 311 ) b - substrate orientation . for",
    "a similar @xmath0 qd structure grown on a ( 100)-substrate we also obtained characteristic probability density maps of ground and exited states .",
    "to summarise , we have observed features in @xmath19 corresponding to resonant tunnelling through a limited number of discrete states whose wavefunctions display the symmetry of the ground state and excited states of quantum dots . with the simple device configuration we have used",
    ", it is not possible to tell whether an excited state feature and a ground state feature correspond to the same quantum dot .",
    "this question could be resolved by new experiments on structures with electrostatic gates .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown how the magnetotunnelling spectroscopy provides a new means of probing the spatial form of the wavefunctions of electrons confined in quantum dots .",
    "the study revealed a biaxial symmetry of qd states in the growth plane .",
    "we observed the elliptical shape of the ground state and the characteristic lobes of the higher energy states .",
