    "the computational physics group@xcite at the zhongshan university is in a period of rapid development .",
    "the group s interests@xcite cover such topics as lattice study of hadron spectroscopy@xcite , glueball decay and mixing , qcd at finite density@xcite , quantum instontons@xcite and quantum chaos@xcite using the quantum action@xcite .",
    "most of these topics can be studied through monte carlo simulation , but can be quite costly in terms of computing power . in order to do large scale numerical investigations of these topics , we built a high performance parallel computer@xcite using pc components .",
    "qcd has been accepted to be the most successful gauge theory of strongly interacting particles .",
    "calculation of hadron spectroscopy remains to be an important task of non - perturbative studies of qcd using lattice methods .",
    "this paper is one of our first steps@xcite in the direction of studying hadron properties . our reasons for performing simulations with wilson valence quarks are twofold : first , we are interested in the analysis of hadronic spectroscopy for quenched wilson fermions ; second , we are interested in exploring the performance of our cluster in actual lattice qcd simulations .",
    "we decided to do a spectrum calculation on the @xmath4 lattice at @xmath8 and 5.85 , and on the @xmath9 and @xmath7 lattices at @xmath10 .",
    "the results at smaller @xmath5 values are used to compare with those in the literature , while those at a larger @xmath5 value , corresponding to smaller lattice spacing @xmath11 , are useful for extrapolating the lattice results to the continuum limit .",
    "the smearing technique is employed to improve the spectrum data .",
    "we hope our data will be an important addition to the lattice study of qcd spectrum .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the basic ideas of lattice qcd with wilson quarks are given . in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we describe the simulation parameters as well as some basic features of our cluster . in sect .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we present new calculation of some light hadron masses . finally , conclusions and outlook are given in sect .",
    "our starting point is the wilson action @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath3 , and @xmath13 is the ordered product of gauge link variables @xmath14 around an elementary plaquette .",

    "then all the physical quantities are calculable through monte carlo ( mc ) simulations with importance sampling .",
    "fermion fields must be integrated out before the simulations , leading to the vacuum expectation value for an operator @xmath22 @xmath23 \\bar{f}([u ] ) e^{-s_{g}([u ] ) }   \\left ( \\det m \\right)^{n_f }   \\over \\int [ du ] e^{-s_g([u])}\\left ( \\det m \\right)^{n_f } } \\approx { 1 \\over n_{\\rm config } } \\sum_{\\mathcal c }   \\bar{f}[{\\mathcal c } ] .",

    "the correlation functions of a hadron is : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a hadron operator . for sufficiently large values of @xmath30 and the lattice time period @xmath31",

    "( [ fit ] ) , the hadron mass @xmath33 is obtained .",
    "the quenched gauge field configurations and quark propagators were obtained using the recently built zsu cluster@xcite .",
    "the full machine has 10 nodes , and each node consists of dual pentium cpus .",
    "the total internal memory is 1.28 gb and the sustained speed is around 2 gflops .",
    "an upgrade is planned .",
    "the cluster runs on the linux operating system . to operate the cluster as a parallel computer , the programmer must design the algorithm so that it appropriately divides the task among the individual processors .",
    "we use mpi ( message passing interface ) , one of the most popular message passing standards .",
    "we updated the pure su(3 ) gauge fields with cabibbo - marinari quasi - heat bath algorithm@xcite , each iteration followed by 4 over - relaxation sweeps .",
    "the simulation parameters are listed in tab .",
    "[ parameters ] .",
    "the distance between two nearest stored configurations is 100 .",
    "the auto - correlation time was computed to make sure that these configurations are independent .",
    "the @xmath34 quark and @xmath35 quark are assumed to be degenerate .",
    "the quark propagators are calculated in the coulomb gauge using the independent configurations mentioned above , and conjugate gradient for inversion of the dirac matrix with preconditioning via ilu decomposition by checkerboards@xcite .    at @xmath10 ,",
    "we computed the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and proton and @xmath2 masses on the @xmath6 and @xmath36 lattices at four values of hopping parameter : @xmath37 , 0.1486 , 0.1492 , and 0.1498 with point and smeared@xcite sources . in order to compare our results with those by milc and gf11 ,",
    "the quenched simulations were also performed at @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the @xmath4 lattice .",
    "we repeated the quenched simulations of the milc and gf11 collaborations , using the same set of @xmath40 values @xcite but on a @xmath41 lattice .",
    "detailed data will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "to extract masses from the hadron propagators , we must average the correlation function of the hadron over the ensemble of gauge configurations , and use a fitting routine to evaluate the hadron masses @xmath33 .",
    "we determined hadron masses by fitting our data under the assumption that there is a single particle in each channel @xcite .",
    "point source means a delta function , and smeared source means a spread - out distribution ( an approximation to the actual wave - function of the quantum state ) .",
    "for example , the simplest operator for a meson is just @xmath42 , i.e. the product of quark and anti - quark fields at a single point .",
    "a disadvantage of this point source , is that this operator creates not only the lightest meson , but all possible excited states too . to write down an operator which creates more of the single state",
    ", one must  smear \" the operator out , e.g. @xmath43 where @xmath44 is some smooth function .",
    "here we choose @xmath45 with @xmath46 a normalization factor .",
    "the size of the smeared operator should generally be comparable to the size of the hadron created .",
    "there is no automatic procedure @xcite for tuning the smearing parameter @xmath47 .",
    "one simply has to experiment with a couple of choices .",
    "the effective meson mass for @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of time @xmath30 at @xmath10 and on the @xmath7 lattice is depicted in figs .",
    "[ pion_6.25_36_48 ] and [ rho_6.25_36_48 ] respectively .",
    "as one sees , the plateau from which one can estimate the mass , is very narrow for point source , due to the reason mentioned above . when the smearing source is used , the width of the plateau changes with the smearing parameter @xmath47 .",
    "we tried many values of @xmath47 and found that when @xmath48 , the effective mass is almost independent on @xmath47 and the optimal value for @xmath47 is 26 , where we observe the widest plateau .",
    "the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , proton and @xmath2 masses @xcite at @xmath8 and on @xmath4 are consistent with the previous gf11 data @xcite and those for the mesons at @xmath49 and on @xmath4 are comparable with those in @xcite on the @xmath7 lattice .",
    "this means the finite size effects are very small . at @xmath49",
    ", we also see that our results for the proton and @xmath2 masses@xcite are bigger than the milc data and consistent with the finite size behavior analysis in @xcite .",
    "more detailed results will be given in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ edinburgh_5.7_5.85_6.25 ] , we show the edinburgh plot , ( @xmath50 ) vs. ( @xmath51 ) mass ratios .    in figs .",
    "[ pion_kappa_6.25 ] , and [ rho_kappa_6.25 ] , we show respectively @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 as a function of @xmath56 at @xmath10 and on the @xmath36 lattice . assuming that @xmath52 is linear in @xmath57 , we can compute the critical coupling @xmath58 at which the pion becomes massless .",
    "we extrapolate the data using : @xmath59 the results for @xmath60 , and @xmath53 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 at @xmath60 on the @xmath9 and @xmath36 are given in tab.[tab2 ] , where the experimental value for the @xmath1 mass has been used as an input .",
    "the finite size effects are consistent with @xcite . also , the mass ratios @xmath63 and @xmath64 seem to be closer the experimental values , 1.222 and 1.604 on the larger lattice . to compare @xmath65 and @xmath66 with experiment",
    ", we need to do simulation on a larger lattice volume and carefully study the lattice spacing errors . in this aspect",
    ", it might be more efficient to use the improved action and some progress@xcite has been reported by some lattice groups in china .",
    "in this paper , we have presented new data on hadron masses in qcd with wilson valence quarks at @xmath10 on the @xmath67 and @xmath36 lattices .",
    "our results at @xmath8 are consistent and those at @xmath49 are comparable with the results in the literature . we have also made a more careful and systematic study of the smearing method .",
    "such large scale simulations had usually required supercomputing resources @xcite , but now they were all done on our recently built cluster for parallel computer . in the task of lattice qcd simulations , we are confident that zsu s pentium cluster can provide a very flexible and extremely economical computing solution , which fits the demands and budget of a developing lattice field theory group .",
    "we are going to use the machine to produce more useful results of non - perturbative physics .",
