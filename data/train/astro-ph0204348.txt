    "massive stars have a strong impact on the evolution of galaxies .",
    "o  type stars and their descendants , the wolf  rayet stars , are the main source of uv photons , mass , energy and momentum to the interstellar medium .",
    "they play the main role in the ionization of the interstellar medium and dust heating .",
    "the milky way is the best place to access , simultaneously , massive stellar populations and their impact on the surrounding gas and dust .",
    "the sun s position in the galactic plane , however , produces a heavy obscuration in the optical window ( @xmath5 mag ) toward the inner galaxy , where massive star formation activity is the greatest .",
    "shifting to longer wavelengths , the perspective is much better , especially in the near infrared , because these wavelengths are long enough to lessen the effect of interstellar extinction ( @xmath6 mag ) and still short enough to probe the stellar photospheric features of massive stars @xcite .",
    "the study of giant h  ii regions ( gh  ii ) in the near  infrared can address important astrophysical questions such as : 1 . characterizing the stellar content by deriving the initial mass function ( imf ) , star formation rate and age ; 2 .",
    "determining the physical processes involved in the formation of massive stars , through the identification of ob stars in very early evolutionary stages , such as embedded young stellar objects ( ysos ) and ultra  compact h  ii regions ( uch  ii ) ; and 3 . tracing the spiral arms of the galaxy by measuring spectroscopic parallaxes of zero age main sequence ob stars .",
    "the exploration of the stellar content of obscured galactic gh  ii regions has been studied recently by several groups : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in particular , blum and collaborators presented near infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations of three optically obscured gh  ii regions : w43 , w42 and w31 .",
    "these observations revealed massive star clusters at the center of the h  ii regions which had been previously discovered and studied only at longer wavelengths .    in this work ,",
    "we present results for ngc3576 ( g291.3 - 0.71 ) , located at a kinematic distance @xmath7 kpc , which we adopted from @xcite , after correcting for the standard galactic center distance ( @xmath8 kpc ) .",
    "ngc3576 appears in the visible passbands as a faint h  ii region , but in the infrared it is among the most luminous in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "in fact , with 1.6 x 10@xmath9photons s@xmath10 inferred from the radio data , it can be classified as a gh  ii ( following the suggestion of r. kennicutt for sources brighter than @xmath11 lyman continuum , @xmath12 @xmath13 , photons per second , private communication ) .",
    "a gh  ii region has at least ten times the luminosity of the orion nebula and roughly the number emitted from the hottest single o3-type star , thus implying multiple hot stars .",
    "ngc3576 was observed in the radio continuum by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have detected radio recombination lines .",
    "maser sources have also been detected in the region : ch@xmath14oh @xcite and h@xmath15o @xcite .",
    "the detection of intense emission in the 10 @xmath2 m window , h@xmath15o masers , and the compact thermal emission in the radio are typical indications of the primitive stages of star formation and of a dense circumstellar environment .",
    "photometry from 1 to 2.5 @xmath2 m of the brightest sources was performed by moorwood & salinari ( 1981 ) and by @xcite showing that the spectral energy distributions of these objects suggests that they have excess emission .",
    "an intense co j=21 line at 230 ghz was observed by @xcite in the core region of ngc3576 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we present an investigation of the stellar content of ngc3576 through the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 imaging and @xmath1band spectroscopy ( described in  2 ) . in ",

    "the osiris 1999 march images were obtained under photometric conditions .",

    "no corrections were applied for these small difference in airmass .",
    "aperture corrections measured inside 20 pixel radius circles were used to put the instrumental magnitudes on a flux scale .",
    "six uncrowded stars on the ngc3576 images were used for this purpose .",
    "since the brightest stars in the 1999 images were saturated , we have taken short exposure images in may 2000 . although the conditions in may 2000 were non - photometric , we used stars in common with the 1999 images to determine the zero point for the additional ( bright ) stars .",
    "uncertainties for the @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 magnitudes in 1999 images include the formal dophot error added in quadrature to the error in the mean of the photometric standard and to the uncertainty of the aperture correction used in transforming from the dophot photometry to osiris magnitudes .",
    "the sum in quadrature of the aperture correction and standard star uncertainties are @xmath250.032 , @xmath250.034 and @xmath250.069 mag in @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",

    "the dophot errors were larger than @xmath25 0.01 mag , and we adopted a cutoff for errors larger than 0.05 mag , which corresponds to a limiting magnitude of @xmath26 @xmath27 15.0 .",

    "the effect of this excess emission is stronger in the @xmath1band than at shorter wavelengths .",
    "although the open circles and triangles in the bottom right of figure  [ ccd ] indicate only lower limits , these objects are also likely affected by thermal emission .",
    "they are bright in the @xmath1band and should be detected in @xmath16 and/or @xmath17 if affected only by interstellar reddening and if they were cluster members with typical extinction .",
    "the cluster characteristics indicate that the stars havent had enough time to evolve away from the main sequence .",
    "we expect that most of the high mass stars are close to the zero age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "we can estimate the reddening toward the cluster from a simple approximation @xcite @xmath35 @xmath27 1.6@xmath36 and using the fact that the average intrinsic color of hot stars is almost zero @xcite .",
    "the stars brighter than @xmath37 have an average color of @xmath38 , corresponding to @xmath39 = 1.57 mag ( @xmath40 @xmath20 15.7 mag ) .",
    "the interstellar component of the reddening can be separated from that local to the cluster stars by using the star hd 97499 .",
    "this is a foreground star , since it is brighter and less reddened than stars in the cluster and is offset from the radio source line - of - sight by 2 arc - minutes . from its spectral type b1 - 2iv - v _ michigan spectral catalogue _ - @xcite and magnitude , a distance of 2.4 kpc was derived @xcite .",

    "we were not able to independently check the distance derived by depree ( 1999 ) via spectroscopic parallax ( see below ) , but we expect that the radio kinematic distance is reliable for this galactic direction .    in order to place the zams in the cmd , the corresponding bolometric magnitudes ( @xmath46 ) and effective temperatures ( @xmath47 ) must be transformed into @xmath30 colors and apparent @xmath18 magnitudes .",
    "@xcite models for the zams with solar abundances were adopted .",
    "the bolometric corrections ( bc ) applied to derive absolute visual magnitudes ( @xmath48 ) are from @xcite for spectral types @xmath49 to @xmath50 and from @xcite for later spectral types .",
    "the intrinsic colors ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) are from @xcite . using the distance modulus ( 12.24 ) and the apparent visual magnitude",
    ", we transform the @xmath46 into apparent @xmath54 magnitudes .",
    "the correspondence between spectral types and @xmath47 are from @xcite for @xmath49 to @xmath50 and from @xcite for later spectral types .",
    "since koornneef s colors are in the johnson system , which is nearly identical to saao system @xcite , we used the saao to cit / ctio relations to transform koornneef s @xmath30 color indices to the cit / ctio system .",
    "these corrections are about 1% and could be neglected when compared with the photometric errors and differential reddening .",
    "the zams is represented by a vertical solid line in figure  [ cmd ] , shifted to @xmath55 kpc and reddened by a@xmath56 = 0.43 due to the interstellar component . when adding the average local reddening ( a@xmath57 , the zams line is displaced to the right and down , as indicated by the dashed lines .",
    "we can not fix the position of the zams , since there is a scatter in the reddening .",
    "the small group of relatively bright stars ( @xmath58 ) in between these two lines , suggests that some of them , the bluer ones , could mark the position of the zams .",
    "unfortunately , we do nt yet have spectra of these objects to check whether or not this is true .",
    "objects to the right of the o - type stars line ( figure  [ ccd ] ) have colors deviating from pure interstellar reddening .",
    "this is frequently seen in young star clusters and is explained by hot dust in the circumstellar environment .",
    "we can estimate a lower limit to the excess emission in the @xmath1band by supposing that the excess at @xmath16 and @xmath17 are negligible , and that the intrinsic colors of the embedded stars are that of ob stars .",
    "indeed , assuming that our sample of stars is composed by young objects ( not contaminated by foreground or background stars ) , any object would have an intrinsic color in the range @xmath59 mag @xcite .",
    "let us adopt for all objects in our sample the intrinsic colors of a b2 v star : @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the error in the color index would be smaller than the uncertainty in the mathis law , we are using for the interstellar extinction .",
    "> from the difference between the observed @xmath33 and the adopted b 2 v star we obtain the color excess and by using the relation ( @xmath62 ) we derive the interstellar extinction in the @xmath63band and so the intrinsic apparent magnitudes @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath54 .",
    "> > from another relation of mathis law ( @xmath66 ) , we derive the magnitude at @xmath1band corrected from the interstellar extinction .",
    "the difference between this number and @xmath54 gives the excess emission in the @xmath1band , due to dust thermal emission .    for stars not detected in the @xmath63band",
    "we suppose they are affected by an interstellar extinction @xmath67 equal to the median value of those measured in the @xmath63band . in this way , we derive the extinction in the @xmath68band by using mathis law in the form : @xmath69 . from here the procedure to derive the @xmath1excess magnitude",
    "follows the same steps as we did before . for stars not detected in the @xmath68band",
    ", we still want to estimate the @xmath1excess , since potentially interesting objects are too red to be detected in the @xmath68band .",
    "a lower limit for this excess can be derived by using the same procedure as above , but assigning a limiting magnitude @xmath70 for objects not detected in the @xmath68band .",
    "our results are displayed in figure  [ kexc ] .",
    "objects with very large excess in the upper right corner of figure  [ kexc ] , can not be explained by errors in the de  reddening procedure and could be real .",
    "they could represent the emission of accreting disks around the less massive objects of the cluster .      in order to separate the cluster members from projected stars in the cluster direction , we imaged a region close to ngc3576 .",
    "the star counts were normalized by the relative areas projected on the sky and then binned in intervals of @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the stellar density in the field was then subtracted from that of the cluster in bins of magnitude and color intervals .",
    "this works well for foreground stars , since there were a few in the cluster field .",
    "regarding the background , the situation is more complex , however , since ngc3576 produces so high an obscuration , almost no background objects can be seen at this limiting magnitude .",
    "the completeness of dophot detections was determined through artificial star experiments .",
    "this was accomplished by inserting fake stars in random positions of the original frame , and then checking how many times dophot retrieved them .",
    "the psf of the fake star was determined from an average of real stars found in isolation and in areas of dark sky . in total , we inserted 2400 stars in the magnitude interval 8 @xmath73 k @xmath73 20 , which amounts to six times the number of real stars recovered in the original dophot run .",
    "for every @xmath74 we inserted simultaneously 5 stars , repeating the procedure for 20 times .",
    "the insertion of all the 100 stars at once would impact the stellar crowding and change the detection conditions .",
    "the incompleteness of the sample is defined as the percentage of times the fake star fails to be recovered .",
    "we performed these experiments in the whole frame and also in each of the three sub  images that were cut out from it , displayed in figure  [ finding ] . the upper right sub ",
    "image is representative of detection limited by photon statistics , the one at the center , by high background and the lower left one , by stellar crowding . in figure  [ completeness ]",
    "we present the photometric completeness .",
    "the _ dashed _ line ( without symbols ) refers to the whole image .",
    "the limit is different for different sub  images , e.g. for an area with high nebular background ( _ circles _ ) , for a crowded area ( _ squares _ ) , or for an area with few stars and a dark sky ( _ triangles _ ) . the performance of the photometry is better than 90% for a 15th magnitude star found in isolation , as compared to stars in the nebular zone which need to be ten times brighter to be detected with the same efficiency",
    "since there is no objective way to define the sub - image limits we applied a single completeness correction to the whole frame ( dashed line ) . as seen in figure  [ completeness",
    "] such a correction is close to the curve limited by crowding .",
    "future work seeking to obtain deeper photometry in this cluster demands a substantial improvement of the spatial resolution and will require adaptative optics imaging from ground based telescopes .",
    "after correcting for non - cluster members , interstellar reddening , excess emission ( a lower limit ) and photometric completeness , the resulting @xmath1band luminosity function ( @xmath75 ) is presented in figure  [ klf ] .",
    "a linear fit , excluding deviant measures by more than @xmath76 , has a slope @xmath77 .",
    "a similar klf slope was obtained for w42 ( @xmath78 ) by @xcite .",
    "we can evaluate the stellar masses by using @xcite models , assuming that the stars are on the zams and not the pre - main sequence ( but see below the discussion in  3.2 ) .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for massive members of such a young cluster .",
    "the main errors in the stellar masses are due to the effects of circumstellar emission and stellar multiplicity .",
    "our correction to the excess emission is only a lower limit , since we assumed the excess was primarily in the @xmath18 band . @xcite",
    "have computed disk reprocessing models which show the excess in @xmath16 and @xmath17 can also be large for disks which reprocess the central star radiation .",
    "in general , we can expect the excess emission to result in an overestimate of the mass of any given star and the cluster as a whole .",
    "the slope of the mass function should be less effected .",
    "it is difficult to quantify the effect of binarity on the imf .",
    "if a given source is binary , for example , its combined mass would be larger than inferred from the luminosity of a `` single '' star and its combined ionizing flux would be smaller .",
    "the cluster total mass would be underestimated , the number of massive stars and the ionizing flux would be overestimated .",
    "the derived imf slope would be flatter than the actual one .    with these limitations in mind",
    "we have transformed the klf into an imf . since other authors also do not typically correct for multiplicity , our results can be inter compared , as long as this parameter does nt change from cluster to cluster .",
    "the @xmath79 slope derived for ngc3576 is @xmath4 ( figure  [ imf ] ) , which is consistent with salpeter s slope @xcite . a similar imf slope was obtained for the trapezium cluster ( @xmath80 ) by @xcite .",
    "flatter slopes have been reported only for a few clusters , most notably the arches and quintuplet clusters @xcite , both near the galactic center .",
    "flatter slopes may indicate that in the inner galaxy star forming regions , the relative number of high mass to the low mass stars is higher than elsewhere in galaxy .",
    "it is also possible that dynamical effects may be more important in the inner galaxy . @xcite",
    "have modeled the arches cluster data with a normal imf , but include the effects of dynamical evolution in the presence of the galactic center gravitational potential .",
    "they find the observed counts are consistent with an intial salpeter  like imf .",
    "we derived an upper limit to the total mass of the cluster ( our imf is likely overestimated due to excess emission , see above ) by integrating the @xmath79 between @xmath81 - where the distribution is nearly continuous .",
    "the lower mass limit was adopted from @xcite taking into account the @xmath79 turnover measured by those authors in orion .",
    "the integrated cluster mass is m@xmath82 = 5.4 x 10@xmath83 m@xmath84 .",
    "as pointed out above , this is likely an upper limit .",
    "source # 48 is anomalously bright and needs to be treated separately .",
    "let us assume that it is affected by an interstellar reddening equal to the cluster average : a@xmath85 , which implies a derredned magnitude k@xmath86 .",
    "if we take at face value the @xmath87 color to represent only an excess at @xmath18 , the reprocessing disk would contribute with @xmath88 .",
    "this excess emission is clearly an underestimation , since the stellar flux is swamped by the disk emission to the point of veiling all the photospheric lines ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , if the excess emission was so small , the luminosity of # 48 would require a cluster of four 100 m@xmath84 stars , unresolved down to a limit of 0.6@xmath22 , which does nt seem to be the case .",
    "if object # 48 is a single o3 v star , it would contribute with nlyc @xmath12 1.17 @xmath25 0.05 x 10@xmath9 s@xmath10 .",
    "alternately , we can evaluate the excess emission by using @xcite models for reprocessing disks . by starting with the maximum excess emission @xmath89 valid for a o7-type star ( their table 4 ) we derive the m@xmath90 .",
    "using vacca et al .",
    "( 1996 ) calibration , we obtain the corresponding stellar spectral type ( and mass ) that is much smaller than the o7-type we started with .",
    "the next step is reducing the excess emission ( adequate for a smaller stellar luminosity ) , deriving a larger final mass , and iterating until convergence .",
    "this was achieved for an excess emission @xmath91 , corresponding to a spectral type b1 v and mass m @xmath12 17 m@xmath84 .",
    "this is possibly a lower limit , since the intervening extinction toward # 48 is probably larger than the cluster average .",
    "we can say that # 48 is a late  o / early  b / early b yso , very similar to what has been found by @xcite in w31 for the brightest @xmath1band object in that cluster .",
    "object # 48 is buried in a large and dense disk , and its contribution to the cluster mass and ionizing photons are negligible .    we have compared the locations of the @xmath1band sources in our images with the mid  infrared sources of @xcite .",
    "source # 48 is very close to their irs1 and # 11 to their irs3 .",
    "these sources appear also in the iras small scale structure catalogue ( x1109 - 610 ) and the iras point source catalogue ( iras11097 - 6102 ) . in the case of irs1 , at least , recent high resolution mid - infrared images @xcite clearly indicate that it is associated with our object # 50 , 1@xmath22 to the south of the @xmath1band source # 48 .      the number of lyman continuum photons derived from the imf , excluding object # 48 is nlyc @xmath12 0.42 @xmath25 0.22 x 10@xmath9 s@xmath10",
    ". the contribution of this single object could be as large as nlyc @xmath12 1.17 x 10@xmath9 s@xmath10 , in the case it is an o3 v star .",
    "this is very close to the nlyc @xmath12 1.6 @xmath25 0.4 x 10@xmath9 s@xmath10 derived from radio observations @xcite scaled to a distance of 8 kpc to the galactic center .",
    "however , we have shown in the preceeding sub - section , object # 48 probably is a much less massive object , a b1 v star .",
    "it can be seen that the nlyc is highly sensitive to the particular procedure used to correct for the excess emission and extinction .",
    "very probably we have missed a handful of main sequence o - type stars responsible for the ionizing flux seen at radio wavelengths . moreover , the spectra of the eight brightest stars described in the next section , indicate that the ionizing stars must be apparently faint .",
    "the properties of the cluster are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the stellar cluster is located in the ne border of a molecular cloud .",
    "the stellar density increases toward the sw , ending abruptly , with a few sources embedded in the molecular cloud ( figure  [ color ] ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of color indices ( figure  [ cc_map ] ) also shows a similar gradient . this is due , in part , to the increasing extinction toward the inner molecular cloud .",
    "however , the red colors are intrinsic to many of the sources , since there are excess emission objects in this zone .",
    "this suggests that stars at the sw are younger than at ne , since recent models by @xcite predict formation times of the same order for stars of different masses .",
    "a similar scenario for this cluster , by which star formation is progressing toward the inner zones of the molecular cloud , has been suggested by @xcite and @xcite and our images dramatically confirm this to be the case ; see figure  [ color ] .",
    "spectra of eight cluster members ( # 4 , # 11 , # 48 , # 69 , # 78 , # 95 , # 160 and # 184 ) , are shown in figure  [ co ] and figure  [ ftless ] .",
    "spectra of a foreground m - type and an a - type stars were added at the top of the figures for comparison .",
    "the a - type star also was divided by the average continuum slope of the other observed a - type stars .",
    "object labels are the same as in figure  [ finding ] ;  [ cmd ] ; and  [ ccd ] .",
    "ordinates in figure  [ co ] and figure  [ ftless ] are normalized fluxes , as follows .",
    "we constructed templates for telluric absorption bands by observing a - type stars , close in time and airmass to the target stars .",
    "we removed the br@xmath28 line from those spectra by hand ( linear interpolation ) , since this region is free from telluric features .",
    "there are no other noticeable photospheric features in a - type stars in the @xmath1band .",
    "then we divided the spectrum of each target by the appropriate a - type spectrum and normalized the resulting spectrum at 2.19 @xmath2 m .",
    "the signal  to  noise ratio is s / n @xmath92 for # 4 , # 11 and # 95 and @xmath93 for the other objects .    the spectra were placed on a flux scale by dividing by @xmath94 and multiplying by @xmath1band fluxes corresponding to the @xmath1magnitudes in table  2 .",
    "however , it is straight forward to compare the observered spectra ratioed only by the a  type continuum .",
    "it can be seen that all the cluster member candidates display rising continuua to the red when compared to the a  type and m  type foreground stars .",
    "these eight stars are thus most likely cluster members , but we can not rule out that some may be background stars",
    ". we must take into account that these objects are projected toward the central part of the cluster and thus subject to high obscuration ( a@xmath85 ) due to the intra cluster gas and dust .",
    "objects # 48 , # 95 , and # 160 are undoubtedly cluster members , since , in addition , they have excess emission .",
    "object # 69 is bright in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands and judging from its @xmath30 color , it should be relatively bright in the @xmath63band , but it is nt detected at all in the @xmath63band osiris images , appearing above the reddening line in figure  [ ccd ] .",
    "the spectrum of this object in figure  [ ftless ] looks like its neighbor # 78 , that is 1.5 magnitude fainter and still is detected in the @xmath63band .",
    "this puzzling situation was clarified when we took a @xmath1band acquisition image ( feb/2002 ) with phoenix at gemini under very good seeing ( @xmath27 0.250.3  ) . in that image ,",
    "object # 69 is shown as a small nebula , with no sign of a buried point - like source .",
    "object # 69 is a clump of dense material ionized by object # 48 or some other neighboring source",
    ". the h@xmath95 2.122 @xmath2 m emission could be either shock or ionization produced .",
    "the narrow features at 2.058 ( ) and 2.166 @xmath2 m ( br@xmath28 ) in figures  [ co ] and  [ ftless ] are due to contamination from the extended nebula .",
    "the spectra were extracted in such a way that the large scale nebular component is over  subtracted . in some objects these lines are in emission , due to enhanced nebular emission close to the star .",
    "objects # 48 , # 160 , # 78 and # 69 show h@xmath95 2.122 @xmath2 m in emission .",
    "this feature appears is emission also in # 11 and # 95 , but since the he  i and br@xmath28 components are not over subtracted , this feature may be due to contamination of extended nebular emission .",
    "the co bandhead at 2.2935 @xmath2 m is in absorption in # 4 , # 160 , # 184 and in emission in # 48 .",
    "none of those objects show photospheric lines indicating that they are still enshrouded in their birth cocoons .",
    "this is corroborated by the excess emission in the @xmath1band derived from photometry except for objects # 4 and # 184 ( table  2 ) .",
    "a variety of mechanisms and models have been proposed to explain the origin of co emission in ysos .",
    "these include circumstellar disks , stellar or disk winds , magnetic accretion mechanisms such as funnel flows , and inner disk instabilities similar to those which have been observed in fu orionis  like objects and t  tauri stars in a phase of disk accretion @xcite .",
    "@xcite shows that gas free - falling along the field lines yield the bandhead profiles , in agreement with those observed , with the shape of the profile determined mainly by inclination of the disk to the line of sight .",
    "hanson et al . ( 1997 ) reported the presence of co in emission in several masssive stars in m17 .",
    "the situation is less clear for objects # 4 , # 160 and # 184 displaying co in absorption .",
    "the absence of large color excess indicates that they could be cool pre - main sequence stars still in a contraction phase . while we can not rule out that they are evolved background m - type stars , they do appear projected on the core of the newly formed cluster .",
    "these objects deserve further study , and if they are indeed pre - mainsequence stars , then the imf determination above has a component whose masses have been overestimated .",
    "the h@xmath95 molecular emission is produced by shocks and may indicate the existence of gas outflow . since we subtracted the extended background close to the stars , the spectra show only the spatially unresolved component of h@xmath95 .",
    "we can thus be confident that h@xmath95 emission in # 48 and # 69 are emitted close to the stellar sources .",
    "however , since these two sources are only @xmath96 apart , the emission could be associated with either or both objects .",
    "it may be surprising that most of the stars with featureless spectra are close to the interstellar reddening line .",
    "however this is in accord with the hillenbrand et al .",
    "models ( 1992 ) for early type stars , which predict relatively small color excesses ( @xmath97h - k@xmath98 ) for objects with large excess emission ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "such models do not predict large departure from the reddening line , like displayed by objects # 160 and # 50 . those sources might be surrounded by local dusty clouds , in addition to the accreting disk .",
    "we have presented deep @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 images of the newborn stellar cluster in ngc3576 ( figure  [ color ] ) and @xmath1band spectra for eight cluster members . the @xmath1band excess emission displayed by objects # 4 , # 11 ( irs3 ? ) , # 48 , # 69 , # 78 ,",
    "# 95 , # 160 and # 184 , in combination with their featureless continuum or co emission / absorption ( figure  [ co ] ) , indicates that they are young , massive stars still in the process of accreting material from their birth cocoons .",
    "the lack of photospheric features and presence of disk signatures indicates that ngc3576 is one of youngest massive star clusters in the milky way .",
    "our data also confirm the scenario of star formation progressing from the ne toward the inner parts of the molecular cloud ( sw ) , but the very young age of the cluster may contradict the claim of enhanced he abundance in the ne part of the gh  ii region by @xcite .",
    "there are no evolved stars in the cluster which could produce the enhancement and the time to diffuse nuclear processed material from neighboring regions into the nebular environment would be much larger than the cluster age .",
    "the fact that the nebular excitation increases toward the ne , producing stronger he lines , may have influenced the abundance calculations .",
    "since our data do not enable us to derive spectroscopic parallaxes ( no photospheric lines were detected in the luminous stars ) , we have adopted the radio distance obtained by @xcite revised to 2.8 kpc by using the most recent galactic center distance ( @xmath8 kpc , @xcite ) .",
    "the cluster parameters are not well constrained because of distance uncertainty and the difficulty in correcting the @xmath1band magnitude for the circumstellar dust emission and extinction .",
    "the overall picture summarized in table  1 of a massive and dense cluster remains valid .",
    "however , the ionizing flux derived from the imf is much smaller than that from radio observations .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that we havent found spectroscopically the massive main sequence stars that ionize the cluster .",
    "those stars probably remain behind heavily obscuring clouds .    the fact that several of the brightest cluster members do not show revealed photospheres raises the question : where are the ionizing sources of ngc3576 ?",
    "it is plausible that some of the faint sources are in reality luminous objects seen through large extinction , and were not accurately dereddened because they escaped detection in the @xmath16 and @xmath68band .",
    "this may also explain why the number of lyman continuum photons derived from the imf is smaller than that measured at radio wavelengths .",
    "to tackle this question , we plan to obtain spectra from stars of @xmath100 and fainter using the gemini south 8m telescope .    in order to understand better the circumstellar environment of the ysos we examined here , we have performed high resolution mid - infrared imaging with the gemini south telescope which will be analyzed in a future paper .",
    "our goal is to derive the characteristics of the circumstellar dust , in particular evaluating its contribution to the near infrared excess emission , extinction , and the possible presence of accreting disks .",
