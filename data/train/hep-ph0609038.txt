    "thermal leptogenesis @xcite is an attractive and minimal mechanism to generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xmath7 , or , normalised to the entropy density , @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a lepton asymmetry is dynamically generated and then converted into a baryon asymmetry due to @xmath9-violating sphaleron interactions @xcite which exist in the standard model ( sm ) and its minimal supersymmetric extension , the mssm .",
    "leptogenesis can be implemented within the `` seesaw''(type i ) model @xcite , consisting of the sm ( mssm ) plus three right - handed ( rh ) majorana neutrinos ( and their superpartners ) with a hierarchical spectrum . in the simplest case , the lightest of the rh neutrinos",
    "is produced by thermal scattering after inflation , and subsequently decays out - of - equilibrium in a lepton number and cp - violating way , thus satisfying sakharov s constraints @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry is commonly calculated by solving a boltzmann equation for the total lepton asymmetry ( flavour - independent approximation ) and for the abundance of the lightest rh neutrino @xcite .",
    "however , this flavour - independent treatment is rigorously correct only when the interactions mediated by charged lepton yukawa couplings are out of equilibrium .",
    "the impact of flavour in thermal leptogenesis has been first addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite and then studied in detail @xcite , including the quantum oscillations / correlations of the asymmetries in lepton flavour space @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the boltzmann equations describing the asymmetries in flavour space have additional terms which can significantly affect the result for the final baryon asymmetry .",
    "this is because leptogenesis involves the production and destruction of right - handed neutrinos , and of a lepton asymmetry that is distributed among _",
    "distinguishable _ flavours .",
    "the processes which wash out lepton number are _ flavour - dependent _ , e.g. , the inverse decays from electrons can destroy the lepton asymmetry carried by , and only by , the electrons .",
    "the asymmetries in each flavour are therefore washed out differently , and will appear with different weights in the final formula for the baryon asymmetry .",
    "this is physically inequivalent to the treatment of washout in the flavour - independent approximation , where indistinguishable leptons propagate between decays and inverse decays , so inverse decays from all flavours are taken to wash out asymmetries in any flavour .",
    "flavour - dependent effects in leptogenesis have been studied in the two right - handed neutrino model @xcite , where they have been shown to be relevant .",
    "it remains to be seen how important these effects are in more general neutrino mass models with three right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the latest experimental data on neutrino oscillations is consistent with ( approximate ) tri - bimaximal mixing @xcite .",
    "the fact that the tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing matrix involves square roots of simple ratios motivates models in which the mixing angles are independent of the mass eigenvalues .",
    "one such class of models are seesaw models with sequential dominance ( sd ) of right - handed neutrinos @xcite . in sd",
    ", a neutrino mass hierarchy is shown to result from having one of the right - handed neutrinos give the dominant contribution to the seesaw mechanism , while a second right - handed neutrino gives the leading sub - dominant contribution , leading to a neutrino mass matrix with naturally small determinant .",
    "in a basis where the right - handed neutrino mass matrix is diagonal , the atmospheric and solar neutrino mixing angles are determined in terms of ratios of yukawa couplings involving the dominant and subdominant right - handed neutrinos , respectively .",
    "if these yukawa couplings are simply related in some way , then it is possible for simple neutrino mixing angle relations , such as appear in tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing , to emerge in a simple and natural way , independently of the neutrino mass eigenvalues .",
    "if sd is combined with vacuum alignment in flavour models then tri - bimaximal neutrino mixing can be readily achieved @xcite .",
    "the sd mechanism has been widely applied to a large variety of unified flavour models involving three right - handed neutrinos @xcite , and it is therefore of interest to see how important the effects of flavour - dependent leptogenesis are in this more general framework .    in this paper",
    "we study thermal leptogenesis in classes of neutrino mass models based on the seesaw mechanism with sequential dominance , taking into account lepton flavour in the boltzmann equations .",
    "we generalize the issue of including flavour effects in the boltzmann equations to the supersymmetric case . within this class of model",
    "we investigate constraints and expectations on the individual decay asymmetries and washout parameters from the present data on neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "flavour effects are shown to have important consequences for the estimation of the produced baryon asymmetry in this class of models .",
    "flavour - independent leptogenesis has previously been considered for sequential dominance models in @xcite .",
    "the present analysis clearly goes well beyond the previous analysis by considering the important flavour - dependent effects .",
    "also the link between the leptogenesis phase and the mns neutrino oscillation phase has been explored in sequential dominance in @xcite . here",
    "we shall revisit this link in the light of flavour effects and obtain new links between the cosmology and neutrino oscillation physics .",

    "we have studied thermal leptogenesis in a class of neutrino mass models based on the see - saw mechanism and sd , taking into account lepton flavour in the boltzmann equations in both the sm and mssm .",
    "sd models are a very well motivated class of models which have been widely applied to unified flavour models , and thus are quite representative of the general class of three right - handed neutrino models where the importance of flavour - dependent leptogenesis effects has hitherto not been evaluated .    in general ,",
    "flavour - dependent effects of leptogenesis are relevant at low enough temperatures ( set by the lightest right - handed neutrino mass ) such that at least one charged lepton flavour is in thermal equilibrium . when this condition is met , flavour - dependent effects are important when the efficiency factors @xmath160 differ significantly for the distinguishable flavours .",
    "the efficiency factors @xmath160 depend on @xmath411 which in sd are determined from the magnitudes of the yukawa couplings of the lightest right - handed neutrino to the different lepton flavours , as indicated in tab .  [",
    "tab : decayasym ] .",
    "if the dominant right - handed neutrino is the lightest one , then only @xmath412 may differ , since @xmath317 implies that @xmath318 , and flavour - dependent effects are only important when @xmath413 , corresponding to non - zero texture element in the ( 1,1)-element of the neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath233 .",
    "we have studied this case numerically and shown that dramatic effects can result . moreover , we have also seen that , even with @xmath225 , flavour - dependent effects are relevant for the leptogenesis - mns link since the decay asymmetries @xmath414 may differ due to @xmath415 .",
    "an extreme example of this is when there are two zero textures in the dominant and leading subdominant parts of @xmath233 , for instance @xmath416 , in which case the cosmological cp violating phase for leptogenesis is directly related to the cp violating phase @xmath0 of the mns matrix observable in neutrino oscillations .",
    "furthermore , the baryon asymmetry of the universe under this conditions determines the sign of the mns phase @xmath0 ( i.e.  the sign of @xmath329 ) for the case where the lightest right - handed neutrino is the dominant one .",
    "we have shown that this phase is opposite to the case where the lightest right - handed neutrino is the leading subdominant one , enabling the two types of sd to be distinguished experimentally .",
    "for the case that the lightest right - handed neutrino is the almost decoupled one , there is no leptogenesis - mns link .",
    "nevertheless this case is amongst the most promising for thermal leptogenesis since the efficiencies may be optimal .",
    "although this is also true in the flavour - independent treatment , flavour - dependent effects are expected to play an important role when the efficiences are unequal , corresponding to the magnitudes of the yukawa couplings @xmath417 being unequal . unlike the previous case , this can be achieved with a zero texture in the ( 1,1)-element of @xmath233 corresponding to @xmath418 , since here we can have @xmath419 since these couplings are unconstrained by neutrino phenomenology , and so in general may be quite different .",
    "thus very large flavour - dependent effects can be present in this case , an extreme example being when @xmath420 and @xmath421 are equal and opposite which would lead to a zero result in the flavour - independent case , but a non - zero result in the flavour - dependent case due to the different efficiency factors .    in conclusion",
    ", we have seen that in many cases flavour - dependent effects may be important for leptogenesis in sd models involving three right - handed neutrinos due to the efficiencies of the distinguishable flavours being different .",
    "the effects range from factors of three , up to differences of a few orders of magnitude , or in extreme cases having a large non - zero flavour - dependent result for cases where the flavour - independent result gives zero . in other cases",
    "the flavour - dependence of leptogenesis is not important for the asymmetry , due to the efficiencies of distinguishable flavours being equal , as in the case when the lightest right - handed neutrino dominates the see - saw mechanism , and there is a zero texture in the ( 1,1)-element of @xmath233 .",
    "however even in this case the relationship between leptogenesis phases and the mns phase is affected by flavour - dependent effects due to the lepton asymmetries being unequal .",
    "we conclude that flavour - dependent effects can not be ignored when dealing with three right - handed neutrino models .",
