    "it is widely accepted that spiral arms are the preferred sites of star formation and , as most stars form within embedded cluster ( ec ) the arms are sites of cluster formation .",
    "star formation may occur after the collapse and fragmentation of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) that occur within spiral arms transforming dense gas clumps into ecs .",
    "based on the absence of massive @xmath8 bright molecular clouds in the interarm space , @xcite argue that molecular clouds must form in spiral arms and be short - lived ( less than 10myr ) .",
