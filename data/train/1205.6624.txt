    "high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) , attosecond pulse trains ( apt ) and single attosecond pulses ( sap ) will be introduced .",
    "we refer the unfamiliar reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for more comprehensive reviews of attosecond physics .",
    "the work on attosecond light pulses stems from a process discovered in the late 1980s called hhg @xcite .",
    "it was found that a broad plateau in the xuv range , containing a comb of almost equally strong , odd harmonics , could be produced by focusing an intense ultra - short ir laser pulse into a target of noble gas .",
    "a sketch of a typical hhg experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ harmonics ]  ( a ) , where first an intense ir field interacts with a target of ar - gas to generate high - order harmonics , then these harmonics propagate to a different chamber where they photoionize ar - atoms so that photoelectrons are emitted .",
    "[ harmonics ]    with a titanium : sapphire laser system ( photon energy of @xmath0ev , corresponding to a near - ir laser wavelength of @xmath1 nm ) using chirped - pulse amplification @xcite , the typical laser intensity used for hhg is @xmath2w/@xmath3 .",
    "harmonic conversion efficiencies as high as @xmath4 and photon energies in the soft x - ray range have been obtained @xcite . neither the broad comb of high - order harmonics , nor their high conversion efficiency can be explained using standard theoretical tools of non - linear optics , where the laser field is treated as a perturbation @xcite . in the perturbative formalism ,",
    "an increase in harmonic order @xmath5 is always accompanied by a strong reduction in conversion efficiency as is evident from the well - known non - linear conversion formula : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the intensity of the laser in a scaled set of variables . as an example , the relevant intensity scale for laser - atom interactions is the so - called atomic unit of intensity : @xmath8 w/@xmath9 . as mentioned above ,",
    "optimal conditions to observe hhg processes are obtained with titanium : sapphire laser devices operated at @xmath10w/@xmath9 , so that , in scaled units @xmath11 .",
    "in direct contrast with such perturbative behaviour , the harmonic comb from hhg may contain many harmonic orders of comparable intensity , @xmath12 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ harmonics ]  ( b ) .",
    "a _ cut - off law _ for the maximal photon energy in the hhg plateau was found numerically to be @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ionization potential of the atom , and @xmath15 is the so - called ponderomotive energy of the electron in the laser field @xcite . the latter energy is associated with the average oscillatory ( quiver ) motion of a free electron driven by a single - frequency field . using eq .",
    "( [ cutofflaw ] ) and ( [ up ] ) in the limit @xmath16 , the cut - off increases quadratically for longer laser wavelengths , @xmath17 , and linearly with the laser intensity , @xmath18 .",
    "this scaling has been used to increase the harmonic photon energies into the kev regime using laser fields with longer wavelengths ( mid - ir wavelengths ) @xcite .",
    "although hhg spectra from simple systems could be reproduced by numerical simulations based on the resolution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) @xcite , a convenient scenario to explain the mechanism of the process is based on the so - called _ three - step model _ @xcite .",
    "the three steps are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ threestep ] .",
    "[ threestep ]    a more detailed quantum mechanical theory for hhg was published by lewenstein and co - workers in 1994 @xcite , showing that the three - step model could be derived from the schrdinger equation using the strong field approximation ( sfa ) . in this way ,",
    "a more exact cut - off law was derived analytically , @xmath19 corresponding to electrons with quasi - classical ( complex ) trajectories @xcite , which are closely - related to feynman s path integral approach to quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this semi - classical model explained why the harmonics were of comparable strength , but it also revealed that several semi - classical trajectories contribute to the emission of each harmonic .",
    "this finding implied that each harmonic was emitted in two bursts per half - cycle of the laser , thus leading to a complicated temporal structure of the harmonic emission .",
    "it has been shown , as reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the problem of these multiple emission times can be circumvented experimentally thanks to the phase - matching properties of the _ macroscopic _ medium , leading to a `` selection '' of the emission from the shortest family of electron trajectories .",
    "also , it was soon understood that such frequency combs of high - order harmonics would correspond to light with pulse durations on the attosecond timescale , _",
    "i.e. _ shorter than any light pulses ever produced , under some restrictive conditions regarding their relative phases @xcite .",
    "the generation of such `` attosecond pulses '' is a challenging task especially because the experimentalists have to find a way of manipulating the relative _ phase _ of the harmonics over the large spectral bandwidth of the comb @xcite .",
    "another major challenge was to devise a scheme to measure the duration of the pulses .",
    "this was because existing methods used in traditional ultra - fast optics could not be directly applied due to the short wavelength and relatively low intensity of the harmonics .      in 2001 ,",
    "more than a decade after the first hhg process was observed , the first attosecond pulse trains ( apt ) were characterized using a scheme called rabitt ( resolution of attosecond beating by interfering two - photon transitions ) @xcite .",
    "as measured in a set of experiments , the attosecond pulse duration was @xmath20as = 250@xmath21s , corresponding to @xmath22 of the laser period , and to @xmath23 of the laser pulse duration used for hhg .",
    "two attosecond pulses were produced per oscillation of the laser field , resulting in a train of @xmath24 pulses in the total apt .",
    "a typical fraction of an apt is depicted in fig .",
    "[ attotrain ] .    [ attotrain ]",
    "making the ir pulse shorter leads naturally to fewer attosecond pulses .",
    "it was soon demonstrated that a single attosecond pulse ( sap ) could be generated using a few - cycle ir pulse , @xmath25fs @xcite .",
    "the basic properties of the sap can be determined using the attosecond - streak camera @xcite , while more complete characterization requires the use of the sophisticated frog ",
    "crab scheme ( frequency resolved optical gating ",
    "complete reconstruction of attosecond bursts ) @xcite . for such short ir pulses ,",
    "the carrier envelope phase ( cep ) is an important parameter that must be controlled .",
    "for instance , the generation of a sap can be changed into the generation of two attosecond pulses by carefully tuning the cep of the laser field @xcite .",
    "one of the most impressive applications of sap was the `` direct measurement of light waves '' @xcite , where the sap was used to map out the oscillating vector potential of a few - cycle optical laser pulse .",
    "another useful way of controlling the hhg process is called `` polarization gating '' @xcite , which relies on the dependence of laser - polarization for the yield of hhg . in simple terms",
    ", linear polarization implies that the gate is open because attosecond pulses are being produced , while elliptical polarization suppresses the hhg and closes the gate . from a more fundamental standpoint ,",
    "attosecond pulses are interesting because they are shorter than any pulses created by conventional optical lasers .",
    "physically , we understand this because the duration of a light pulse can not be shorter than its own period .",
    "optical lasers , corresponding to visible and ir wavelengths , have a period that is longer than a femtosecond , leading to the so - called _ femtosecond barrier _ for ultra - short pulses .",
    "the power needed to drive a laser scales strongly with the photon frequency , @xmath26 , which effectively prevents the conventional laser scheme from going beyond optical wavelengths @xcite . more formally , a pulse intensity envelope has a minimal duration proportional to the inverse of the supporting coherent bandwidth , @xmath27 where @xmath28 ( and @xmath29 ) is the intensity bandwidth of the light . in the case of a gaussian pulse , @xmath30 for the intensity envelope .",
    "the minimal pulse duration , called the _ fourier - limited _ pulse duration , occurs when all the spectral components are compressed , _",
    "i.e. _ when the spectral phase is perfectly linear .",
    "the attosecond pulses produced through hhg can overcome the femtosecond barrier not only because they have a much shorter wavelength than optical light , but also because they have a broad coherent bandwidth .",
    "it is interesting to compare the bandwidth of the laser used for hhg with the bandwidth of the attosecond pulses being generated .",
    "an ir laser pulse used for generation of an apt has a typical duration of 30fs and a bandwidth of 60mev ; while the corresponding attosecond pulses are 100as with a bandwidth of 15ev . during the hhg process the coherent bandwidth",
    "is increased by a factor of 250 from laser to high - order harmonics .",
    "attosecond pulses can be used to ionize atoms and molecules at extremely well - defined times , but how do the resulting photoelectron wave packets and holes behave after the ionization event ? how can the attosecond pulses be used to obtain temporal information about physical processes occurring on the atomic timescale ?",
    "using attosecond pulses to ionize target atoms or molecules does not by itself provide any high - resolution temporal information ! when the photoelectrons are collected in an experiment , we can only determine the value of the momentum ( or energy ) they have gained in the course of the process , but not _ how _ or _ when _ it was acquired .",
    "this implies that the temporal ionization events must be synchronized and probed with the help of an external `` clock '' that `` ticks '' itself on the attosecond timescale .",
    "the typical period of light in the optical regime is on the femtosecond timescale , but one can argue that its variation occurs in the sub - femtosecond regime , which then justifies its common usage as a probe in attosecond photoionization experiments . in this way , it is possible to use a fairly long laser pulse , say tens of femtoseconds , to monitor attosecond photoionization events . clearly , it is important that the probe - field is _ phase - locked _ with the attosecond pulses , a requirement which is easily satisfied in hhg experiments by using fractions of the _ same _ laser pulse for both creating the attosecond pulses and for probing the photoionization process . using attosecond pulses with phase - locked laser probes , has led to a range of experiments where time - delays between photoelectrons from different configurations and systems have been measured @xcite . then , the natural question that emerges is whether or not such attosecond experiments yield direct access to the delay in photoemission , _",
    "i.e. _ to the time it takes for an electron to photoionize , or if the observed delays should be interpreted in a different way ? before answering these questions , we briefly review different pump - probe schemes that have been used to experimentally study light ",
    "matter interactions in real time .",
    "[ introattophotoexp ] in this tutorial , we provide a theoretical background for the temporal aspects of photoionization .",
    "the attosecond pulse structure is shorter than the response time of any detector or electronic device , but it is possible to obtain temporal information about attosecond photoionization indirectly by investigating coherent cross - correlation photoelectron spectrograms between the attosecond pulse and a weak ir laser probe . in fig .",
    "[ pulsesketch ] we present three different kinds of cross - correlation techniques .     [ pulsesketch ]      a typical pump  probe scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pulsesketch ]  ( a ) .",
    "first , a pump pulse is used to excite the system at time @xmath31 .",
    "a part of the quantum mechanical wave function is then pumped from the initial state to an excited wave packet : @xmath32 .",
    "the system can then evolve in a field free environment until time @xmath33 , when the probe pulse interacts with the excited wave packet , thus changing its state : @xmath34 . in experiments",
    ", the modification of the wave packet leads to the change of the observable quantities as a function of the delay between the pump and the probe pulses .",
    "temporal information about the field - free propagation of the system , _",
    "e.g. _ a molecular vibration , can then be extracted in real time by repeating the experiment systematically for different delays of the probe pulse . in this way",
    ", the intermediate steps in chemical reactions , the so - called `` transition states '' , have been investigated in the framework of zewail s femtochemistry @xcite . clearly , the intuitive interpretation of these experiments is limited by the respective pulse durations . using few - cycle optical - laser fields to pump and probe",
    "the system is adequate to study nuclear motion in molecular systems , typically occurring on the femtosecond timescale .",
    "coherent , attosecond xuv pump  probe experiments , where attosecond pulses are used for both pumping and probing , hold promise of observing the electron dynamics on the attosecond timescale , but they are difficult to implement experimentally due to the low probability for absorbing two photons in the xuv range , where we assume that _ at least _ one photon must be absorbed from both the pump and the probe for a meaningful signal .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite ( and the references therein ) for state - of - the - art experimental efforts on xuv - pump and xuv - probe experiments bordering the attosecond timescale .",
    "a different kind of pump - probe experiments has been carried out using a sap as pump and a few - cycle laser pulse as probe , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite , where the fourier transform of the delay - dependent spectrogram yields quantum beats , but also interference between direct and indirect pathways in the ionization .      a more commonly used attosecond pump  probe configuration is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pulsesketch ]  ( b ) , where the pump and probe pulses _ overlap _ in time .",
    "in this situation it is not primarily the field - free system that is of interest , but rather the temporal characterization of the pulses or the evolution of the system in the presence of the two fields .",
    "the pump probe is an attosecond xuv pulse , while the probe pulse is a longer ( few femtosecond ) ir - laser pulse . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is a _ laser - assisted photoionization process _",
    ", where the system is simultaneously pumped and probed .",
    "sub - femtosecond temporal information can be gained by repeating the experiment at different subcycle delays between the attosecond pump pulse and the laser field oscillation of the probe pulse .",
    "clearly , it is essential that the two pulses are phase - locked and that the delay can be controlled with sub - femtosecond precision .    under these conditions , the system can absorb energy simultaneously from the two fields _ i.e. _ while it absorbs one xuv photon , it is `` dressed '' by the relatively intense ir probe field .",
    "accordingly , a non - perturbative approach is needed to account for the effect of the probe . a simplified theory for the influence of the probe pulse on the photoelectrons",
    "is given by the _ streak camera _",
    "formalism @xcite .",
    "this simplified interpretation of the photoelectron distribution relies on the use of the sfa , which is equivalent to assuming that the photoelectron feels the instantaneous laser field while the coulomb potential of the ionic core is neglected . according to the sfa , the streaked electron momentum distribution",
    "is then shifted as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the unshifted , probe - free momentum ; @xmath37 is the elementary charge and @xmath38 is the probe - field vector potential at the time of ionization .",
    "this concept of `` instantaneous streaking '' provides a simple map from time to momentum of the streaked electrons , which is valid assuming that the electron is free shortly after the ionization event , _",
    "i.e. _ that it either escapes from a short - range binding potential or is ejected with a high velocity . in practice , the electron is not completely free after the ionization event due to the remaining coulomb potential from the ion .",
    "smirnova and co - workers found that the simultaneous action of the long - range coulomb potential and the probing laser field can result in a small shift of the streaking process @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ an uncertainty on the absolute delay in the experiment .",
    "until recently @xcite , these delays were considered too small to be accessible in streaking experiments .      in fig .",
    "[ pulsesketch ]  ( c ) , a train of `` identical '' attosecond pump pulses are probed with a monochromatic ir - field .",
    "this scheme is often referred to as the rabitt method @xcite .",
    "provided that the probe pulses are weak and that the fields are repeated periodically for many cycles , this scheme can provide equivalent information as the streak - camera method described above [ fig .",
    "[ pulsesketch ]  ( b ) ] .",
    "we will discuss this equivalence in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : stpt ] in terms of photoelectron wave packets , and we suggest that the interested reader should consult ref .",
    "@xcite for a complete derivation in lowest - order perturbation theory .",
    "higher - order effects in the probe field have been considered using the `` soft - photon approximation '' @xcite , but the high - level of accuracy that is required for attophysics remains a challenge to theory , especially so in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "the shared periodicity of the apt and the probe field implies that the photoelectrons will appear on distinct energies corresponding the discrete numbers of absorbed photons . in fig .",
    "[ rabitt ] we display a typical experimental photoelectron spectrogram produced by laser - assisted apt ionizing ar gas .    [ rabitt ]    the advantages of the periodic time - structure of apt are rather practical : first , it is less demanding experimentally to produce apt and multi - cycle probe - fields , than sap and few - cycle probe fields .",
    "second , the probe field can be weaker than for streaking , thereby , causing less side - effects on the system , _ e.g. _ induced polarization of the core or ionization .",
    "third , the signal is read out on zero - background , _",
    "i.e. _ in energetic regions where no initial photoelectrons appear . finally , a monochromatic probe field simplifies the analysis because it leads to less spectral convolutions in the experimental signal , as we shall discuss further in sec .",
    "[ sec : stpt ] .",
    "in this setup , there is a phase - difference associated with the instantaneous probing by the laser field , which can be traced back to the phase - shift of the relevant two - photon matrix elements .",

    "a theoretically reliable way of accounting for the probe must be found @xcite . by decreasing the intensity of the probe field ,",
    "the streaking modulation is reduced and one arrives in a regime where standard perturbation theory is applicable @xcite .",
    "this presents a large advantage for quantitative theoretical work , since it can be based on well - established mbpt .",
    "finally , in this subsection we briefly discuss other attosecond delay experiments that are _ not _ directly related to single - photon ionization by an xuv field . this important class of attosecond experiments are conducted in the hhg cell directly , and they are sometimes referred to as _ self - probing _",
    "systems , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent tutorial on self - probing of molecules with hhg . in these experiments , the electron wave packet in the continuum",
    "is thought of as a probe for the entire system , holding promise of simultaneous temporal and spatial resolution of molecular dynamics @xcite . in this subsection",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to one of the simplest self - probing systems , namely , atoms undergoing hhg in two - colour laser fields consisting of a strong fundamental , @xmath78 , and a much weaker , parallel second harmonic , @xmath489 .",
    "an interesting aspect of this two - colour setup , is that the presence of the second harmonic breaks the inversion symmetry of the hhg process , which leads to the production of odd _ and _ even harmonics @xcite . a phase - difference ( or time - delay ) in the intensity modulation of different even harmonics",
    "was observed as a function of the delay between the @xmath78 and @xmath489 fields .",
    "early experimental and theoretical work suggested that the phase of this modulation could be used to characterize the emission times of attosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "experimentally , it was eventually found that the phase behaved in an unexpected way close to the harmonic cut - off @xcite , which , after some more detailed calculations @xcite , lead to a new interpretation of the observed delays with , instead , a connection to the keldysh tunnelling parameter @xcite . the delay in _ tunnelling _",
    "ionization has been studied by the group of keller using angular streaking , often referred to as the `` attoclock '' @xcite . in this setup ,",
    "a close - to - circularly polarized femtosecond laser field is used to tunnel - ionize electrons .",
    "subcycle resolution is obtained by studying angular displacements of the final momentum of the photoelectrons . using this angular streaking method a vanishing tunnelling delay has been confirmed .",
    "we need to stress the differences between the two kinds of streaking : the conventional form of streaking requires a sap and a femtosecond probing laser field with linear polarization , while the angular streaking requires only a single femtosecond pulse with a tailored polarization . in regular streaking , temporal information about laser - assisted , single - xuv - photon ionization is gained ; while in the case of angular streaking , the temporal aspects of strong - field ( multi - photon ) tunnelling is studied . the theoretical work presented in ref .",
    "@xcite highlights the difficulties and prospects of self - probing systems involving electron continuum probes initiated through strong - field tunnelling .",
    "attosecond science is attracting a great deal of attention because it promises accurate control and probing of electron processes in atomic and molecular systems in real time . in this tutorial , we have presented a detailed theoretical analysis of photoionization of neutral atoms by attosecond xuv pulses and coherent xuv high - order harmonics .",
    "we have found that , indeed , attosecond pulses can be used to initiate photoionization at well - defined times , but to probe such an ultra - fast event requires careful considerations about the quantum mechanical interactions between the photoelectron and the remaining ion .",
    "ultimately , it is commonly believed , that the probing process will be carried out using a second attosecond pulse , but such experiments are demanding due to the need for two - photon processes in the xuv range .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for a state - of - the - art experimental scheme using xuv for both pumping and for probing the processes on a time - scale bordering the attosecond domain .    at the present time , the temporal aspects of photoionization are more often probed by a phase - locked , ir - laser field .",
    "this has the advantage of a much stronger interaction with the photoelectron , in fact , here the interaction can be so strong that many such laser photons are absorbed .",
    "this situation is called `` streaking '' because it can shift the photoelectron momentum distribution to higher or lower values depending on the subcycle delay between the attosecond pulses and the probe field .",
    "this highly non - linear process is difficult to handle with high - fidelity in theory , and this is the main reason why we have considered instead the interaction with a moderate probe field , which may induce exchange of a single ir - laser probe photon at most .",
    "such moderate probe fields are the standard choice in the temporal probing of apt using the rabitt scheme .",
    "we have demonstrated @xcite that this interferometric interpretation is valid also for sap in the _ on - set _ of streaking . using this `` photon - picture '' ,",
    "we have identified the phases of the lowest - order quantum paths and we have shown that the same temporal information about the photoionization process is gained with either pulse structure , sap _ or _ apt . placing an interpretation on the `` delay '' in laser - assisted photoionization , is not as straight - forward as indicated by the early streak - camera formalism @xcite .",
    "this is because the strong - field approximation is _ not _ a reliable approximation for laser - assisted photoionization .",
    "instead , it turns out that the long - range interaction between the photoelectron and the remaining ion leads to a shift of the time - delays @xcite , which often dominates over the one - photon , wigner - like delays of the photoelectron @xcite . using time - dependent perturbation theory ,",
    "we have shown that these `` measurement artifacts '' can be separated from the wigner - like delays , as written explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ taurabitt ] ) , in the case of both apt @xcite and sap @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that these temporal artifacts can be traced back to phase - shifts in ati transition - matrix elements between continuum states , hence the name `` continuum  continuum phases '' @xcite .",
    "we have here presented both correction curves and analytical expressions for the purpose of correcting for such artifacts in the quest for the _ true _ delay in single - photon ionization . in this tutorial , we have limited ourselves to the sae approximation , with a single photoelectron in a static atomic potential . while this approach is certainly valid for hydrogenic systems @xcite , it is likely to break down in many - electron atoms , when electron  hole interactions are strong and when the electron relaxation plays an important role for the dynamics . here ,",
    "accurate calculations that include multi - electron screening effects of the ion are required .",
    "although a few full - scale simulations have been made including many - electron dynamics @xcite , a conclusive agreement between experiment and theory is yet to be presented .",
    "this calls for _ both _ more experimental data and detailed theoretical work , and then a careful comparison of the two .",
    "in this way , the time - delay experiments provide an important testing ground for more exact analysis and interpretations in attosecond physics and strong - field physics . only when understanding these detailed ultra - fast phenomena , will `` attophysics '' truely provide a route to accurate control and probing of electron processes in atomic and molecular systems in real time .",
