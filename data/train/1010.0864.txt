    "although the annihilation line of positrons at 511 kev is the brightest gamma - ray line in the galaxy , the origin of the annihilating positrons in not yet firmly established .",
    "first observed with a nai scintillator as a @xmath0476  kev line coming from the galactic centre ( gc ) region @xcite , it was subsequently unambiguously identified with a narrow ( full width at half maximum , fwhm@xmath4 kev ) @xmath5 annihilation line using germanium detectors @xcite . since then many balloon flights and several space missions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have measured the spatial distribution and spectral properties of the line .    since 2003 , _ integral _ data on the 511 kev line emission became available .",
    "these data show that there is a strong , @xmath6 , source of 511 kev photons at the centre of the milky way with a fwhm of 68 , while the 511 kev flux coming from the galactic plane is much less constrained by the _",
    "integral _ data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "no significant variability in the narrow 511 kev line has been found in the spi data @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the annihilation radiation from the galactic centre region observed by spi can be reasonably well described as a combination of a narrow line ( @xmath023 kev gaussian at 511 kev ) and a three - photon continuum .",
    "the flux ratio between the three - photon continuum and the narrow line suggests that the majority of positrons form positronium prior to annihilation .    in spite of numerous observations ,",
    "the origin of the 511 kev emission from the gc is not established .",
    "the problem can be summarised as follows :    * the morphology of the observed 511 kev line emission does not fit the disk - like spatial distribution of such obvious sources of positrons as i ) massive stars , which produce @xmath7 unstable nuclei like @xmath8al or ii ) @xmath9 s generated by the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this favours scenarios with a more prominent central excess ( `` bulge dominated '' ) , including the old stellar population ( e.g. supernovae ia ) , activity of sgr a@xmath10 and the annihilation of dark matter particles . *",
    "the spectrum of the annihilation emission ( narrow line width and the flux ratio of the line and three - photon continuum ) suggests that positrons are annihilating in a warm , @xmath11  k , and slightly ionized , @xmath0 a few % , medium .",
    "such an ism phase does exist in the galaxy , but its spatial distribution is strongly concentrated towards the plane , posing the problem of `` finding '' the right ism phase by a positron .    recently",
    "an attempt to build a self - consistent picture was presented by @xcite , who assumed that the spatial propagation of positrons , produced via @xmath7 decay of @xmath12ni , @xmath13ti and @xmath8al , is governed by a diffusion process with the effective diffusion coefficient different in the bulge and the disk of the galaxy . during diffusion",
    "the positrons enter the hii and hi envelopes of molecular clouds , in particular those forming a `` tilted disk '' within 1.5 kpc of the gc .",
    "the model of @xcite , with a reasonable set of assumptions , can explain the basic properties of the annihilation radiation .",
    "here we take an alternative route and consider a possibility that a significant fraction of positrons are born in the hot ism , which is eventually able to cool via radiative losses and perhaps via adiabatic expansion .",
    "we show below that with these assumptions the spectral properties of the 511  kev line can be easily explained .",
    "however , to make our picture self - consistent one needs to model the thermal state of the ism , which is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "this paper is based on the _ integral _ data accumulated over @xmath14 years of observations and aims at placing tighter constraints on the spectral and spatial properties of the annihilation emission .",
    "spi is a coded mask germanium spectrometer on board _ integral _ , launched in october 2002 aboard a proton rocket .",
    "the instrument consists of 19 individual ge detectors , has a field of view of @xmath030(at zero response ) , an effective area at 511 kev of @xmath15  @xmath16 and energy resolution of @xmath02 kev .",
    "the good energy resolution makes spi an appropriate instrument for studying the spectrum of @xmath5 annihilation emission .    for our analysis",
    "we use all data available to us by mid-2009 , including public data , some proprietary data ( in particular , proposals 0420073 , 0520071 and parts of 0620059 ) . prior to actual data analysis",
    ", all individual observations were screened for periods of very high particle background .",
    "we use the spi anticoincidence ( acs ) shield rate as a main indicator of high background .",
    "several additional observations were also omitted from the analysis , e.g. those taken shortly after spi annealing procedures . for our analysis",
    "we used a combination of single and pulse - shape - discriminator ( psd ) events and treated them in the same way .      for each detector ,",
    "a linear relation between the energy and the channel number was assumed and calibrated ( separately for each orbit ) , using the observed energies of lines at @xmath0 198 , 438 , 584 , 882 , 1764 , 1779 , 2223 and 2754 kev . with this calibration",
    "the rms deviation of the background 511 kev line energy ( revolution based ) is 0.0066 kev while the mean energy of the line is 510.926 kev .",
    "there is thus a small deviation of the line mean energy from the electron rest energy ( 510.999 kev ) : @xmath17 kev ; it can be attributed to the simplified linear energy / channel relation .",
    "this deviation is comparable to the statistical uncertainty on the line energy ( see  [ sec : spec ] ) and no attempt was made to correct for this effect .",
    "since the background 511 kev line ( produced by the positrons annihilating in the body of the detector ) is kinematically broadened , we used the two bracketing lines ( at 438 and 584 kev ) to calculate the resolution at 511 kev as @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting value is @xmath19 when averaged over all observations in the vicinity of the galactic centre .      in the background modeling",
    "we followed the scheme used in @xcite .",
    "namely , the background count rate @xmath20 in detector @xmath21 at energy @xmath22 is assumed to be proportional to the detector saturated ( i.e. above 8 mev ) event rate @xmath23 and time @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the detector number .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 of this linear relation were determined separately for each detector / energy channel using all the available spi data , while the constant @xmath29 was estimated using only the data away from the galactic plane and away from bright sources .",
    "the whole data set was divided into 14 time intervals ( defined by the annealing periods and the dates of individual detector failures ) and the coefficients @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 were determined separately for each interval .",
    "this procedure , although not providing a perfect description of the background , works reasonably well at all energies and , given the small number of free parameters , is very robust .",
    "for instance , the relative rms deviation of the 6001000 kev flux ( averaged over one revolution ) from the count rate predicted by this model is @xmath30 .",
    "along with our reference background model , we made several experiments by dividing the full data set into different time intervals and modifying the selection criteria used for cleaning the data from background flares . in these experiments we generated several `` alternative '' background models .",
    "below we use these models to test the sensitivity of our results to the details of the background modeling .",
    "imaging with coded mask telescopes often requires additional assumptions to be made on the sky surface brightness distribution , e.g. sparsity of compact sources or regular behaviour of diffuse emission .",
    "this is especially important for the spi telescope , which has only @xmath31 independent detectors / pixels .",
    "this makes image reconstruction in a single observation problematic , given that a typical image reconstruction procedure relies on the smallness of the parameter @xmath32 with respect to unity .",
    "we have chosen not to make a priori assumptions about the spatial distribution of sources and restricted ourselves to three different types of `` imaging '' : ( i ) light bucket imaging , ( ii ) simple parametric models and ( iii ) linear decomposition of the sky surface brightness into few simple templates .      in this simple `` imaging '' procedure , for each observation ,",
    "the background subtracted counts in a given energy band are summed over all detectors and the resulting signal is added to the pixel of the map corresponding to the telescope pointing direction . similarly the exposure map is formed by adding the exposure times ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : emap ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the counts and the exposure map gives the count rate image , which is crudely converted into units of @xmath33 using the effective area for an on - axis point source .",
    "such maps will provide a correct point source flux if the telescope is pointed directly towards the source .",
    "but given the large size of the spi fov ( @xmath030diameter at zero response ) and sparse coverage of the sky , light bucket mapping produces rather crude maps , while the procedure itself is very simple and robust .",
    "we use light bucket mapping to get a global surface brightness map or to follow the variations of the surface brightness along and across the galactic plane with poor angular resolution .",
    "note that in this mode spi is used as a collimated instrument and its mask imaging capabilities are not exploited .",
    "the net flux ( difference between the observed count rate and predicted background model ) crucially depends on the quality of the background model .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : mslice ] we show slices of the galaxy along the galactic plane in three energy bands . each slice has a width of 16perpendicular to the galactic plane and is centred at @xmath34 .",
    "the step along the galactic plane is 2for the two upper panels and 4for the bottom panel .    in the upper panel ( 50100 kev ) ,",
    "three prominent peaks correspond ( from left to right ) to cyg x-1 , galactic centre and the crab nebula .",
    "the width @xmath030and the complex structure of the peaks near the maximum ( clearly visible for cyg x-1 ) are due to the presence of the mask and partly due to the intrinsic variability of the sources .",
    "the few regions with negative fluxes correspond to observations where the actual background count rate is higher than the model - predicted background described in  [ sec : background ] .",
    "note that the model background was calculated using a set of `` blank fields '' , whose definition is problematic given the large size of the spi fov .",
    "the sets of blank fields are different in each of the 14 time intervals used in the background modelling ( see  [ sec : background ] ) .",
    "for this reason , it is possible that the actual flux from the `` blank fields '' is higher than that from some patches of the galactic place free of strong sources .",
    "the morphology of the slice in the 508514 kev band , containing the 511 kev line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mslice ] , middle panel ) , is markedly different . with the 2bins along the galactic plane , the only prominent feature is the peak at the galactic centre , with the extent along @xmath35 roughly similar to the extent of the peak near cyg x-1 at low energies .",
    "the peak flux is @xmath36 .",
    "as already emphasized , this value is not a precise measure of the true 511 kev flux from the galactic centre region , but it should be accurate to a factor of better than 2 if the source size does not exceed several degrees .",
    "no strong asymmetry of the positive and negative longitude wings of the central peak is apparent in the light bucket profiles ( see , however , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* who report an excess flux for negative longitudes ) and @xcite , who do not find strong evidence for asymmetry ) .",
    "an excess at negative longitudes @xmath37 -25is visible in the light bucket profile in @xcite ( their fig .",
    "2 ) . renormalization of their fluxes to the units used in fig .",
    "[ fig : mslice ] suggests an excess at the level @xmath38 . in our analysis",
    "the flux at @xmath37 -25is essentially consistent with zero .",
    "if anything , the profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mslice ] suggest an excess in the 508514 kev flux at positive longitudes @xmath37 25 . however , our experiments with `` alternative '' background models mentioned in  [ sec : background ] showed that a weak spurious asymmetry ( corresponding to a flux excess / deficit of @xmath39 at @xmath402025 ) can appear at either negative or positive longitudes .",
    "we therefore conclude that , with the present knowledge of the spi background , light bucket profiles do not provide compelling evidence for asymmetry in the 508514 kev flux along the galactic plane .    finally in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mslice ] , the slice of the galactic plane in the 18041813 kev band , containing the 1.8 mev line of @xmath8al , is shown .",
    "unlike the 511 kev emission , there is a broad peak ( much broader than the spi response to a point source ) , centred at the gc .",
    "this distribution is qualitatively consistent with the comptel @xcite and earlier _ integral _ results .",
    "a similar approach of light bucket mapping can be applied to the special scans of the galactic plane along @xmath41 performed in 2007 , 2008 and 2009 .",
    "the positions of the scans in @xmath35 are denoted with the gray vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mslice ] .",
    "three out of four scans were made as a sequence of pointings starting and ending @xmath42away from the plane on either side of it .",
    "the pointing direction was changing in @xmath02steps .",
    "the remaining `` scan '' at @xmath43 had been done earlier as a set of pointings directly at the plane and @xmath025above and below the plane .",
    "the advantage of making `` fast '' ( taking 1015 hours ) scans over a selected region of the sky is that the quality of the background modeling can be verified / improved if typical variations of the detector background occur on longer time scales .",
    "the scans in the 508514 kev band in the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane at @xmath37 0 , 22 , -45are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vslice ] . the signal is clearly visible at @xmath37 22and is close to zero for @xmath37 -45 . to guide the eye , we have plotted with the black curves the expected light bucket profiles for the case where the spatial distribution of the flux in the 508514 kev band follows the `` bulge '' model described later in  [ sec : templates ] .",
    "the expected profiles were crudely estimated assuming that the axis of the instrument was moving along @xmath41 at fixed @xmath35 , while keeping the position angle fixed .",
    "this causes visible asymmetry in the peak of the @xmath37 0profile , reflecting the particular orientation of the spi coding mask relative to the source . in reality , the observed profiles are combinations of observations with varying position angle and varying @xmath35 and hence they may differ from the simulated profiles in subtle details .",
    "broadly , the light bucket imaging shows the overall consistency with a bulge - dominated distribution of the 508514 kev flux and indicates that the disk emission is weak at @xmath37 -45 .",
    "we now use a simple function  two - dimensional gaussian  to model the spatial distribution of the annihilation line emission near the galactic centre . the data collected when the _ integral _",
    "pointing direction was within 30of the gc were used .",
    "two models were considered : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the surface brightness distribution as a function of galactic longitude and latitude , @xmath46 is the flux and @xmath47 , @xmath48 are the full widths at half maximum along @xmath35 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the second model has an additional component that is aimed to account for emission elongated over the galactic plane .",
    "since only the data within 30of the gc were used ( 30corresponds to the deviation of the spi axis from the gc ) , the `` infinite '' extent of this component over @xmath35 means that the surface brightness of this component does not decrease much at a distance of @xmath045from the gc .    to verify the sensitivity of the results to a particular functional form",
    ", we also used an exponential law instead of the gaussian : @xmath49    for a given pair of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the model is convolved with the simulated spi response and compared with the count rate in the 508514 kev band in individual detectors during individual observations .",
    "the best - fitting value of @xmath50 for the one - component model or the pair of values @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the two - component model is calculated . here and in all the subsequent analysis",
    ", we use simple @xmath52 statistics .",
    "the problems of using the @xmath52 criterion for low photon counting statistics are circumvented following the recipe of @xcite .",
    "namely , the standard deviation associated with the count rate in a given spectral , spatial or time bin is evaluated using the mean count rate averaged over a large number of `` nearby '' similar bins .",
    "typical values of @xmath52 per degree of freedom for our models are @xmath53 .",
    "given the large number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath54 number of detectors times the number of observations ) and the very low signal - to - noise ratio of the annihilation signal in individual observations , this value is not a useful indicator of the `` absolute '' quality of the model .",
    "instead , the change of @xmath52 can be used to compare different models or place constraints on the model parameters .",
    "the resulting contours of @xmath52 for both models ( as a function of the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the one - component model ( pure 2d gaussian ) , while the solid lines correspond to the two - component model @xmath55 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : g2 ] ) .",
    "the black dots mark the positions of @xmath52 minima .",
    "contours are spaced by @xmath56 .",
    "the best - fitting values of the widths are 10@xmath57 6(if the one - component model is used ) and @xmath08@xmath57 6(for the two - component model ) 6gaussian gives almost the same @xmath52 as the best - fitting 8@xmath57 6gaussian . ] .",
    "clearly , for the pure 2d gaussian model the data suggest a significant flattening of the distribution towards the plane . if an additional component , extended along the plane , is included ( the two - component model in eq .",
    "[ eq : g2 ] ) , then the best - fitting central gaussian is much more symmetric in @xmath35 and @xmath41 .",
    "the improvement in @xmath52 for the two - component model compared to the one - component model is @xmath58 .",
    "the position of the minimum for the two - component model does not depend much on the width of the extended component over @xmath41 .",
    "we tried for the second component @xmath59 , @xmath60and @xmath61as well as an exponential shape @xmath62 instead of the gaussian , and got essentially the same best - fitting parameters ( 8@xmath57 6 ) for the central gaussian .",
    "we emphasize here that the presence of the second component does not necessarily imply that the galactic disk is `` detected '' , but rather that a single symmetric gaussian / exponential component is not a perfect description of the data .",
    "an exponential shape @xmath63 with @xmath643and @xmath652can also be used to describe the central component ( see table [ tab : templates ] ) instead of a gaussian .",
    "in fact , the largest improvement in the @xmath52 is achieved when both the central and disk components are described as exponential functions ( table [ tab : templates ] ) . while the difference in the @xmath52 between various models ( e.g. one - component exponential versus one - component gaussian ) is formally statistically significant , it corresponds to less than 1% change in the @xmath66 value relative to the `` null hypothesis '' of a zero flux in the 508514 kev band over the entire data set . at this level ,",
    "a particular value of @xmath67 for a given model might be sensitive to the subtle features of the data set .",
    "our experiments with different background models have indeed shown that the ranking of models in terms of @xmath52 can slightly vary .",
    "for example , the ranking of the gaussian+gaussian and gaussian+exponential models in table [ tab : templates ] can change depending on the particular background model .    despite the difference in the functional forms ,",
    "the flux in the central component does not depend strongly on the model used ; it varies between @xmath68 and @xmath69 for all two - components models .      using the one - component exponential model ( the first model in eq .",
    "[ eq : e2 ] ) with @xmath70and @xmath71 , we tried to vary the centroid of the distribution over a few degrees around the gc and calculated the changes in the @xmath52 .",
    "the best - fitting position is at @xmath72 and the minimal @xmath52 differs from the value at @xmath73 by 2.3 .",
    "while this means that formally the statistics of accumulated data is already sufficient to measure sub - degree shifts of the centroid , we believe that systematic uncertainties and the obvious crudeness of the spatial model preclude any firm conclusion .",
    "we can conservatively conclude from this exercise that the position of the centroid is consistent within @xmath00.2with the position of the dynamic centre of the milky way .",
    "@xcite have suggested that a significant fraction of positrons is annihilating in a `` tilted disk '' of neutral gas inside the central 3 kpc region of the galaxy .",
    "this `` tilted disk '' is one of the components of the model of the interstellar gas distribution in the innermost part of the milky way , based on earlier results of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the tilted disk in projection to the sky plane has an apparent size of @xmath018by @xmath05and is tilted by @xmath42with respect to the galactic plane . since the extent of the disk in @xmath35 and @xmath41 resembles the dimensions of the 511 kev source , @xcite suggest that the positrons reach the disk and annihilate there .    to test further the tilted disk model we fit the data with a two - dimensional gaussian allowing for rotation of the major axis .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot ] . the best - fitting rotation angle and the widths of the gaussian in two directions are @xmath7412and @xmath75 , @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "the improvement in @xmath52 compared to @xmath77(and @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) is @xmath80 . as discussed already ,",
    "the values of @xmath81 of the order of a few are formally statistically significant if the errors are due to counting poisson noise only .",
    "the total change of the @xmath52 when a two - dimensional gaussian is added to the model is @xmath82 . comparing these numbers ,",
    "it is clear that even modest systematics in the data could affect precise derivation of the source spatial characteristics .",
    "taking the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot ] at face value , a marginally significant improvement in the fit is possible if the annihilation region is tilted by @xmath83with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "as @xmath84 increases beyond 25 , the gaussian converges to an almost symmetric structure .",
    "the tilt of @xmath85corresponds to @xmath86 for an almost symmetric gaussian with @xmath87and @xmath88 .",
    "we therefore conclude that a version of a the tilted disk of is not particularly favored by spi data compared to a structure with zero tilt . however , moderate values of the title @xmath8920are allowed by the spi data .",
    "the simple light bucket imaging and parametric fitting of the 508514 kev flux done in ",
    "[ sec : bucket ] and [ sec : par ] suggest that a reasonable description of the data in the central radian could be achieved with an almost symmetric gaussian at the centre and a more extended component along the plane .",
    "the stellar bulge and stellar disk are the most obvious structural components of the galaxy that qualitatively fit this description .",
    "in fact , there are plenty of disk - like structures ( cold gas , massive stars , cosmic ray induced gamma - ray flux , etc ) and very few components that show a prominent peak at the gc .",
    "one of the known centrally - peaked distributions is that of the nir light , which is a tracer of the old stellar population of the galaxy .",
    "for this reason , we decided to restrict our analysis to three simple templates , corresponding to stellar components of the milky way , adopted from and shown in fig .",

    "the exponential model has a slightly better @xmath52 than the gaussian model or the bulge model .",
    "for the two - component models , the exponential bulge + gaussian disk has the smallest @xmath52 among the set of models considered here .",
    "it is clear that i ) the true distribution of the 508514 kev flux is likely more complicated than any of the models used and ii ) the relatively modest ( although statistically significant ) changes in the @xmath52 among different models ( containing the bulge component ) suggest that the basic properties of the distribution are captured by our models .",
    "the uncertainty in the choice of the spatial model directly translates into the uncertainty of the 508514 kev flux .",
    "in particular , the total flux of the bulge component varies among all two - component models ( both parametric and based on templates ) from @xmath119 to @xmath120 . at the same time",
    ", the total bulge + disk flux ( integrated over the 80@xmath57 80region ) varies from @xmath121 to @xmath122 .    since some of the spatial templates used in table  [ tab : templates ] are projections of the 3d models ( based on stellar distribution ) , it is easy to recalculate the observed flux @xmath46 into the total luminosity @xmath123 of the corresponding component as @xmath124 . here",

    "using the effective distances from table [ tab : reff ] for the templates truncated at 10% of the maximal surface brightness , the total luminosity of the bulge component is @xmath126 , while the total disk luminosity is @xmath127 . as noted above , the resulting luminosities rely on the model 3d distribution and for this reason they are model dependent .",
    ".effective distance @xmath125 needed to recalculate the observed flux from the 80@xmath57 80region around the gc into the luminosity for different spatial components .",

    "a comprehensive answer to the fundamental question of the origin of the bulk of annihilating positrons should explain a number of key observational facts , including the total production rate of positrons ( @xmath128 positrons per second within the galactic bulge ) , the dominance of the bulge compared to the disk , the morphology of the 511 kev line emission ( a 8@xmath57 6``bulge '' plus a more extended , along the galactic plane , `` disk '' component ) and the spectral properties of the bulge component , which ( within the accuracy allowed by the spi energy resolution ) resemble the annihilation of positrons in a warm ( @xmath11  k ) or cold ( @xmath129  k ) medium with the ionization degree of a few per cent .    on these grounds ( flux and morphology ) , such straightforward explanation as @xmath8al or the interaction of cosmic rays with the ism are disfavored .",
    "the morphology problem can be partly alleviated by assuming transport of the positrons away from the place where they are born .",
    "recently , an attempt to provide a self - consistent model was done by @xcite .",
    "their model assumes that supernovae are the source of positrons ( via @xmath7 decay of @xmath12ni , @xmath13ti and @xmath8al ) in the galaxy and the propagation of positrons in the ism is different in the bulge and in the disk .",
    "the difference in propagation explains the weakness of the disk compared to the bulge  a large fraction of positrons born in the disk escape into the halo , while only a small fraction of positrons escape the bulge . in the bulge ,",
    "the positrons diffuse through the ism and annihilate when entering the hii and hi envelopes of molecular clouds  this explains the spectral properties of the annihilation emission .",
    "finally , the morphology of the bulge is explained by annihilation in a tilted disk within 1.5 kpc of the gc .",
    "the key assumptions in the higdon et al . model are that i ) magnetic flux tubes are almost radial in the bulge region and ii ) positrons propagation along the flux tubes can be treated in the diffusion approximation with the frequency of scattering ( or the mean free path ) estimated from scaling the energy density of magnetic fields down to the larmor radius .",
    "their estimate of the mean free path in the bulge region is large enough to allow positrons to reach the tilted disk ( see  [ sec : tilt ] ) before they slow down and annihilate .",
    "thus the morphology of the tilted disk gives the source of annihilation radiation in the gc its characteristic shape .",
    "here we consider the alternative possibility that the thermal evolution of the ism plays the key role in the gc annihilation emission .",
    "the key assumption of the model is that the medium in which the bulk of positrons are produced and annihilate has a cooling time shorter than the slow down and annihilation time scales . from fig .",
    "[ fig : tcool ] it follows that the temperature ought to be lower than @xmath130k .",
    "gas with temperature in the range @xmath131 few @xmath132  k is observed in the galaxy , as indicated by e.g. cvi , ovii and oviii lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an ism with temperature @xmath130 k is also observed in the central region of m31 @xcite .",
    "the origin of this gas is not clear . for a long time observations of 6.7 and 6.9 kev lines of heavily ionized iron and an unresolved x - ray glow ( at energies above a few kev ) of the galactic plane",
    "were regarded as evidence for a much hotter , @xmath133 k , plasma filling most of the bulge s volume ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "positrons injected into such a medium will slow down and annihilate before the plasma is able to cool ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tcool ] ) , and a very broad annihilation line without an ortho - positronium continuum is expected to be observed , in stark contrast with observations .",
    "however , recent observations have convincingly demonstrated that the apparently diffuse galactic x - ray emission is in fact a superposition of millions of faint compact sources  accreting white dwarfs and coronally active stars .",
    "this removes the problem of confining @xmath133 k gas by the gravitational well of the galaxy .",
    "cooler , @xmath131 few @xmath132  k , gas can on the contrary be trapped in the galaxy potential .",
    "for instance , the density of @xmath134k gas in hydrostatic equilibrium in the milky way potential would drop by a factor of @xmath135 at a distance of @xmath136 kpc above the plane .",
    "this means that such gas can accumulate in the galactic bulge .",
    "however , a self - consistent model explaining the few @xmath132  k ism in the bulge of the milky way or in m31 is still missing . if one takes the mass loss rate by evolving stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the total energy and iron input rate from snia ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then a `` natural '' temperature of the gas is of order few kev ( mean energy per injected particle ) and the expected abundance of iron is about 5 times the solar value . these parameters do not fit the properties of the observed few @xmath132 k component of the ism . @xcite and",
    "@xcite argue that the account for non - uniformity and intermittence in energy injection by snia leads to a broad gas distribution over temperature with a lower than the mean temperature component making largest contribution to the observed x - ray emission .",
    "it is not yet clear if this provides a full explanation of the origin of @xmath132 k gas .",
    "we therefore make an ad hoc assumption that a few million degree medium is widespread in the milky way bulge .",
    "the positron annihilation in a cooling ism (  [ sec : cooling ] ) can resolve some of the issues mentioned at the beginning of this section .",
    "indeed , if the ism is able to cool down to @xmath131@xmath137  k before the positrons annihilate , then the observer will always see a spectrum characteristic of annihilation in a warm plasma .",
    "this resolves the question of why positrons are apparently annihilating in a warm / cold medium even though such a medium should have a relatively small filling factor .",
    "otherwise , the positrons would have to be produced preferentially in the warm and/or cold ism phases or to migrate between phases . in the cooling ism model",
    "this is not required .",
    "if the ism is dynamic and goes through cooling / heating cycles , then even those positrons born in the hot phase will annihilate in a warm ( @xmath137@xmath131  k ) gas .",
    "transport of positrons over large distances is not required in this model .",
    "some moderate transport of positrons will not contradict the model , since it will just make shorter the lifetimes of positrons initially born in the hot ism , but the positrons will still predominantly annihilate while migrating through the warm / cold ism phases .",
    "putting all arguments together , it seems plausible that the following model might work :    * positrons are injected in volume - weighted fashion into the ism ( e.g. by snia ) .",
    "this means that most of the positrons are initially in the hot ism phase .",
    "the key requirement of the model is that the large volume fraction has to be occupied by a few @xmath132 k gas  which may not be true in the galactic bulge .",
    "* the plasma cools radiatively before the positrons slow down .",
    "an outflow , adiabatic expansion of the gas advect / move positrons and may contribute to positron cooling .",
    "* eventually , the plasma reaches relatively low temperatures and the positrons annihilate , producing the spectral features as observed by spi .",
    "if correct , this model predicts that there should be some similarity in the spatial distribution of the annihilation emission and the thermal emission of plasma with temperature in the @xmath1372  @xmath131  k range .",
    "outflows from the central regions of normal galaxies are well - known .",
    "a good example is m31 with clear evidence of hot @xmath130 k gas @xcite , possibly outflowing from the central region . in subsequent publications we plan to consider the dynamics of galactic outflows , advection and annihilation of positrons and the expected spectral signatures ( in soft x - ray and other wavebands ) of the main annihilation sites",
    "we have analysed spi/_integral _ data on the 511 kev line from the galactic centre , accumulated over @xmath06 years of observations .    using a simple two - component bulge+disk model we have constructed the broad - band energy spectra of both components .",
    "the bulge component shows a prominent 511 kev line and essentially no flux at 1.8 mev , while the disk component on the contrary contains a prominent 1.8 mev line and a very weak annihilation line .",
    "the inferred annihilation rate in the bulge component is @xmath128 positrons per second ( for @xmath138 ) .",
    "the fwhm of the 511 kev in the bulge is @xmath139 kev .",
    "the flux ratio of the line and three - photon continuum corresponds to a fraction of positrons annihilating via positronium formation close to unity ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "our experiments with using slightly different spi background models have yielded @xmath141 in the range 0.961 .",
    "this combination of spectral parameters can be explained in terms of a single - phase static ism model , namely as annihilation of positrons in a warm ( @xmath11  k ) or cold ( @xmath129  k ) medium with the hydrogen ionization fraction of a few per cent .    we have demonstrated that the observed annihilation spectrum of the bulge component can also be explained with a model of positrons annihilating in a radiatively cooling ism , provided that the initial temperature of the ism is in the range @xmath142@xmath132  k. in such a medium , the ism cools down to @xmath3@xmath137  k before the positrons are able to annihilate and the observer sees an annihilation spectrum typical of a warm ism .",
    "this suggests that the positrons might be initially injected into the hot ism phase , which has the largest filling factor in the galaxy , but the annihilation occurs only when the gas has cooled down to a relatively low temperature , effectively erasing the memory on the initial conditions ( the initial temperature and ionization state of the ism and the initial energy of positrons ) .",
    "if there is an outflow of hot gas , then the positrons will be advected with the flow and annihilate in the part of the flow where the temperature has dropped to @xmath131@xmath137  k. the mass of the cooling gas need not to be large  it is enough to assume that the initially hot ism phase occupies the largest fraction of the volume where the positrons are produced , provided that positrons do not migrate freely between phases .",
    "the key requirement of the model is that the large fraction of the bulge s volume is occupied by a few @xmath132 k gas . in this paper",
    "this is adopted as an ad hoc assumption .",
    "the origin of this gas in not entirely clear , although observations suggest that this component is present in the central part of the galaxy .",
