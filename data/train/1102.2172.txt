    "negative energy sturmian functions ( s - f ) , introduced in the 60ties by m. rotenberg @xcite , found many useful applications , such as in the calculation of electron induced ionization collisions @xcite , @xcite , in the identification of resonances in nucleon - nucleus scattering @xcite , in the solution of a schrdinger equation with non - local potentials @xcite , for a separable representation of scattering @xmath5matrices @xcite  and in the solution of three - body faddeev equations @xcite .",
    "for the applications involving long range coulomb forces , the analytical expressions for the coulomb green s functions , initially developed by l. hosteler and r. pratt @xcite have found many applications @xcite .",
    "sturmian functions form a complete , discrete set of eigensolutions of a sturm - liouville differential ( or integral ) equation , and form a complete set of basis functions . however",
    "the expansion of a wave function into a set of sturmian functions in many cases does not converge well @xcite , and methods to improve the convergence , such as pad approximations , have frequently been utilized @xcite , @xcite . the atom - atom potentials that occur in atomic physics calculation often have strong repulsive cores , in addition to a long range attractive part , and for such potentials it has been difficult to obtain a reliable set of sturmian functions .",
    "a method based on spectral expansions in terms of chebyshev functions has been recently developed @xcite that overcomes this difficulty , and hence the use of sturmian functions is again of interest .",
    "nevertheless , for numerical calculations the expansions have to be truncated , and because of the slow convergence of sturmian expansions , an iterative method to correct for the truncation error becomes desirable .",
    "it is the purpose of this study to introduce such a method , based on the original quasi - particle method of weinberg @xcite , and , for the purpose of testing it , apply it to the scattering of a particle from a potential as described by the lippmann - schwinger ( l - s ) integral equation . since",
    ", the method described here should be applicable to more general kernels of an integral equation , the present study is done in anticipation of solving the more complicated two - dimensional integral equations that occur in the solution of three - body equations in configuration space @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the expected accuracy is to be better than 6 to 7 significant figures , desirable for doing atomic physics calculations . by comparison ,",
    "the solution of three - body equations for nuclear physics applications , done commonly in momentum space @xcite , achieve an accuracy not better than four significant figures @xcite .",
    "the present paper examines the convergence of several iteration methods for the solution of the l - s equation describing the scattering of a particle with positive energy @xmath6 by a local potential  @xmath7 in one dimension .",
    "the insights gained from this example is to guide one for solving a more general integral equation .",
    "the method initially suggested by weinberg @xcite , also called the `` quasi - particle '' method q - p , requires sturmian functions that are the eigenstates for the exact integral operator .",
    "the present method , denoted as method @xmath8   differs from the q - p method in that it uses auxiliary sturmian functions that are based on an auxiliary potential @xmath9 that is not the same as the potential @xmath10 since it may be computationally easier to obtain the auxiliary sturmians rather than the sturmians for the original integral operator method @xmath11 may prove advantageous for the case of very complicated integral kernels . for the @xmath12 example , the auxiliary sturmians are used to approximate the scattering potential @xmath13 by a non - local separable representation @xmath14 in terms of @xmath15 auxiliary sturmian functions and subsequently correcting for the truncation error @xmath16 by means of iterations .",
    "we find that the rate of convergence of the iterations does not depend significantly on the choice of @xmath17 , provided that the range of @xmath17 is sufficiently larger than the range of @xmath7 .",
    "the sturmian functions in all these cases are calculated in configuration space for a positive energy @xmath6 , so that the asymptotic form of the approximated wave function is the same as the exact wave function . when solving for a bound - state wave function , it is customary the represent the potential by negative energy sturmians that are real , but for scattering cases , positive energy sturmians should be preferable .",
    "an advantage of the sturmian expansion method over the fourier - grid method @xcite for positive energies is that the sturmian method emphasizes only the spatial region where the potential is non - negligible , the asymptotic part of the wave function being already incorporated into the sturmian basis , while in a fourier - grid method , the asymptotic part has to be obtained explicitly .    since an accuracy of the scattering solution to @xmath18 is envisaged , the sturmian functions are also required to have the same , or better , accuracy .",
    "our approach for solving the sturm - liouville eigenvalue equation @xcite utilizes a `` spectral '' expansion method into chebyshev polynomials @xcite , @xcite , that permits one to prescribe a desired accuracy . with this method",
    "one can obtain sturmian eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with an accuracy of , for example , @xmath19 and because of its stability , one can incorporate the effect of long - range tails of potentials , as was demonstrated in the calculation of the bound state eigenvalue of a helium - helium dimer @xcite .",
    "the present calculations are performed in configuration space , and can be generalized to include asymptotic coulomb functions .",
    "contrary to what is often done at negative energies , our approach does not expand the green s functions into a separable set of sturmians , but rather expands the potential @xmath13 into such a set .",
    "the  present method to calculate sturmian functions is similar to a method introduced previously @xcite , in that it does not use a square well potential sturmian basis set in terms of which the desired sturmians are expanded , and , being based on a spectral method , is considerably more precise .",
    "this additional feature permits a more accurate study of the iteration convergence properties .    in section",
    "ii we present the formalism that defines the sturmian functions ; section iii describes the approximate q - p methods @xmath20 and @xmath11 that extend weinberg s q - p original iterative method so that the use of sturmian functions for the integral kernel are avoided , and auxiliary sturmians are used instead ; in section iv numerical examples are presented for the case that the integral kernel is of the lippmann - schwinger type , and section v contains the summary and conclusions .",

    "the result is @xmath62 , and if @xmath63 , the above identity becomes absurd unless @xmath64 because of the completeness of the sturmian functions , one has the identity@xmath65 which can also be written as @xmath66 depending on whether the delta function applies to the left or to the right of the integrand in an integral .",
    "one can understand intuitively the properties of the @xmath55 s as follows @xcite .",
