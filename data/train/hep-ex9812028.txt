    "the transition radiation arises at uniform and rectilinear motion of a charged particle when it intersects a boundary of two different media ( in general case , when it moving in a nonuniform medium or near such medium ) .",
    "this phenomenon @xcite was actively investigated during a few last decades ( see , e.g. reviews @xcite , @xcite ) and widely used in transition radiation detectors ( see , e.g. recent review @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "@xmath11 is fulfilled , in the usual case @xmath12 and radiated frequencies @xmath13 .",
    "the total energy radiated is proportional to @xmath10 and the tr detector are just used to measure this quantity .    in the opposite case @xmath14 and @xmath15 characteristics of the tr are quite different .",
    "the total radiated energy is independent of @xmath10 . performing the collimation of the radiation within angle @xmath1 with respect velocity of the initial particle",
    "one can obtain the radiation concentrated in a rather narrow spectral band near @xmath0 .",
    "the width of this band depend on @xmath1 .",
    "there are limitations on the number of foils @xmath2 due to absorption of the radiated x - rays and multiple scattering of the projectile .",
    "nevertheless one can pick out parameters which permit obtain number of radiated per one crossing photons @xmath16 ( per one projectile ) .",
    "this case is discussed in detail in sec.2 .    in sec.3 the present situation with use of the tr as a x - ray source",
    "is discussed .",
    "some specific features of the proposed radiator are analyzed including selection of the parameters .",
    "set of examples of x - ray sources with various @xmath0 utilizing distinct material of the foils and operating at different energies is collected in table .",
    "the spectral - angular distribution of emitted from ultrarelativistic electrons energy in the radiator consisting of many ( @xmath2 ) thin foils of the thickness @xmath3 separated by equal distances @xmath4 in a gas was discussed in many papers , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the frequency of radiation , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the lorentz factor , @xmath21 is the energy ( the mass ) of the incident electron , @xmath22 is the azimuthal angle of emission with respect velocity of the incident electron ( we assume normal incidence ) , @xmath23 , here @xmath24 , @xmath6 is the plasma frequency @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the density of electrons in the medium of a foil .",
    "the radiated energy is the coherent sum of the tr amplitudes for each interface and in absence of absorption eq.([1 ] ) has the pronounced interference pattern .",
    "although the formula ( [ 1 ] ) is derived in classical electrodynamics , one can introduce the probability of the tr @xmath27 in this paper the system @xmath28 is used , @xmath29 .",
    "recently authors developed the quantum theory of the tr and of the transition pair creation @xcite .    at @xmath30 the main contribution into the integral over @xmath31 in ( [ 1 ] ) , which defines the spectral distribution of the tr , gives the interval of @xmath32 for which @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the formation length of radiation in the vacuum , @xmath5 .",
    "the condition @xmath35 defines the radiated photon energy @xmath18 as a function of the emission angle @xmath22 for fixed @xmath36 ( or for the @xmath36-th radiation harmonic @xmath37 ) . respectively ,",
    "the integral over @xmath31 in ( [ 1 ] ) can be presented as a sum of the harmonic .",
    "we present ( [ 5 ] ) in a form @xmath38 where @xmath39 in practice it is convenient to use @xmath40 where the values @xmath41 are expressed in @xmath42 and the value @xmath3 is in @xmath43 .",
    "interrelation between values of @xmath0 and @xmath44 is very essential for the basic features of the tr .",
    "consider first the case @xmath11 .",
    "for this case the equation ( [ 5 ] ) has solutions for large @xmath45 only .",
    "in this situation the function @xmath46 \\label{7}\\ ] ] oscillates very fast and one can substitute it by the mean value equal to 1/2 . in the integral over @xmath31 in (",
    "[ 1 ] ) represented as the sum of harmonic for large @xmath36 one can substitute summation over @xmath36 by integration @xmath47 after this operation the variables @xmath31 and @xmath18 in ( [ 1 ] ) become independent .",
    "this means together with ( [ 8 ] ) that in this case the tr is the noncoherent sum of the single - interface contributions ( the total number of interfaces is @xmath48 ) . actually just this case ( @xmath11 ) is used in the tr detectors , where the radiated energy is @xmath49    in the present paper we consider the opposite case @xmath14 . in this case",
    "the characteristic angles of radiation are large comparing with @xmath50 ( except boundaries of spectra for the given harmonic ) .",
    "these angles are defined by eq.([6 ] ) @xmath51    if one performs collimation of the emitted radiation with the collimation angle @xmath52 the frequency interval for the n - th harmonic is split into two parts : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are defined by equations following from ( [ 9 ] ) @xmath55 where @xmath0 is defined in ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "when the collimation is strong ( @xmath56 ) the radiation is concentrated in a rather narrow frequency band @xmath57 the spectral distribution of the radiated energy on the @xmath36-th harmonic we obtain integrating eq.([1 ] ) over @xmath31 at @xmath30 in the interval near @xmath31 satisfying the equation @xmath58 @xmath59 as it was indicated above , the relative width of the integration interval @xmath60 and within this accuracy at @xmath30 one can use the formula @xmath61 this formula is exact at @xmath62 .    there is some analogy between radiation considered in this paper and the undulator radiation ( see , e. g. @xcite ) . in undulator the deviation of the particle s velocity @xmath63 from its mean",
    "value varies periodically under influence of the periodical ( in space ) magnetic field . in the considered case",
    "such deviation occurs with the wave vector @xmath64 of emitted radiation ( the refraction index ) while the particle s velocity remains constant .",
    "however , since the velocity @xmath63 and the wave vector @xmath64 are contained in expressions describing the radiation in the combination @xmath65 the both effects are formally equivalent with respect to the coherence of radiation from different periods . the essential difference between considered the tr and",
    "the undulator radiation is due to the dependence of eq.([13a ] ) on @xmath18 .",
    "this property leads to the following consequences :    1 .",
    "the characteristic frequencies of the undulator radiation are directly proportional to @xmath36 ( in contrast to @xmath37 eq.([6 ] ) ) and inversely proportional to the structure period ; 2 .   in the case considered for fixed @xmath36",
    "there is the maximal angle of radiation at @xmath66 and for smaller angles @xmath67 the interval of the allowed frequencies ( @xmath68 ) is divided into two intervals , which are larger than @xmath37 in contrast to the undulator case .    substituting eqs.([13 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) into ( [ 3 ] ) we obtain for the spectral distribution of probability of radiation @xmath69}}{(\\omega-\\omega_n)\\displaystyle{\\left[1+\\frac{l_1}{l } \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_n}-1 \\right ) \\right]^2 } } \\vartheta(\\omega-\\omega_n)\\left[\\vartheta(\\omega_n^{(1)}-\\omega)+ \\vartheta(\\omega-\\omega_n^{(2 ) } ) \\right ] , \\label{14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the heaviside step function . here",
    "the threshold values @xmath54 are defined in eq.([10 ] ) , the value @xmath71 is defined by the collimation angle ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "note that eq.([14 ] ) is independent of the energy of particle .",
    "however , the condition of applicability this equation depends essentially on the lorentz factor @xmath10 : @xmath73 the formula ( [ 14 ] ) was obtained in absence of x - ray absorption which is especially essential in the low frequency region .",
    "taking into account absorption we find limitation on the number of foils @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the x - ray attenuation length at the frequency @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the absorption in a single foil is small .    for the strong collimation ( @xmath77 ) the spectral probability of radiation on the @xmath36-th harmonic",
    "can be written as @xmath78 these probabilities attain the maximal values on the boundaries of the regions .",
    "these values are @xmath79 integrating ( [ 17 ] ) over @xmath18 we obtain the total number of the passing through the collimator photons : @xmath80 the corresponding expressions for the energy losses due to collimated x - ray emission are @xmath81 it is seen from these expressions that one can neglect the contribution of higher harmonics ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the contribution of the first harmonic is concentrated in the narrow frequency interval @xmath83 while in the second available interval the frequencies much larger than @xmath0 contribute ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "so , the collimated tr in the forward direction have quite good monochromaticity .",
    "note that side by side with absorption there is another process which imposes limitation on the number of foils @xmath2 especially when the angle of collimation is small .",
    "this process is multiple scattering of the projectile which leads to a `` smearing '' of the @xmath85-function in eq.([13 ] ) and thus reduces the degree of the monochromaticity .",
    "below we discuss these both processes for some particular examples .",
    "we estimate now the contribution of higher harmonics ( @xmath86 ) into the spectral distribution of probability in absence of the collimation . for @xmath87",
    "this contribution is suppressed as @xmath88 . for @xmath89 the main contribution give values @xmath90 . in this situation",
    "the spectrum becomes quasicontinuous , the factor @xmath91 in eq.([1 ] ) is oscillating very fast and one can substitute it by 1/2 .",
    "the summation over @xmath36 can be replaced by the integration and this is integration of @xmath85-function in ( [ 13 ] ) . for integration over @xmath31 the variables @xmath18 and @xmath31 can be considered as independent . taking this into account and integrating ( [ 1 ] ) over interval @xmath92",

    "use of the tr as a source of x - rays was investigated recently in many papers ( see @xcite-@xcite and references cited therein ) . starting from differential spectral - angular distribution of radiated energy eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) authors analyzed position of maxima in this distribution .",
    "the corresponding resonance conditions are @xmath94 when these conditions are fulfilled there is connection between the emission angle and the photon energy .",
    "measurements were preformed for variety of energies using different foils and various @xmath95 .",
    "typically spectral x - ray intensity was measured as function of the emission angle for fixed photon energy or as function of the photon energy at fixed emission angle .",
    "experimental results obtained in @xcite-@xcite are in quite good agreement with theoretical calculations .",
    "in @xcite yield of x - ray photons ( with energy @xmath96 kev ) from electrons with energy @xmath97  mev was @xmath98 per electron and width of the spectral band was @xmath99 for kapton foils and @xmath100 .",
    "in @xcite yield of x - ray photons from electrons with energy @xmath101  mev ( with energy @xmath102 and @xmath103  kev ) was @xmath104 and @xmath105 per electron respectively and width of the spectral band ( fwhm ) was @xmath106  kev and @xmath107  kev for silicon monocrystalline foils and @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "now we turn to some specific features of proposed approach .",
    "the ratio of thicknesses @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the important characteristic of the tr radiator . the thickness @xmath3 is defined by the radiation frequency ( energy ) @xmath0 eq.([6 ] ) which can be written in a form @xmath110 where @xmath111 ( @xmath112 is density of atoms in the foil ) , @xmath26 is defined in eq.([2 ] ) , @xmath113 is the compton wavelength .",
    "it is seen from eq.([19 ] ) that the number of collimated photons increases with @xmath4 ( the factor @xmath114 ) . from the other side ,",
    "the inequality @xmath115 , which have to be fulfilled in our case , becomes more strong if @xmath116 increases .",
    "in this situation the requirement on the collimation angle @xmath1 becomes more weak and influence of the multiple scattering diminishes ( for the given monochromaticity of the radiation ) : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the radiation length .",
    "so , the optimal value of @xmath4 should be of the same order as @xmath3 .",
    "note that in the tr detectors where @xmath119 there is no limitation connected with the multiple scattering and the thickness @xmath4 usually one order of magnitude larger than @xmath3 . from ( [ 23 ] )",
    "we have the limitation on the value @xmath2 due to multiple scattering @xmath120 using the definitions @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( [ 6 ] ) and explicit formula for @xmath118 ( valid for large @xmath123 ) we rewrite ( [ 23 ] ) in the form",
    "@xmath124 so @xmath125 and @xmath126 and increases when the energy @xmath0 diminishes .",
    "for low @xmath0 the photon absorption ( see eq.([16 ] ) ) becomes essential .",
    "since for @xmath127  kev the x - ray attenuation length @xmath76 for the heavy elements is from two to three order of magnitude shorter than for the light elements , one can use in this region of @xmath18 the light elements only . in the region",
    "@xmath128  kev the attenuation length is rather long , but for large @xmath0 the influence of the multiple scattering of the projectile ( [ 25 ] ) becomes more essential .",
    "in this region one can provide enough large @xmath129 having used the large lorentz factor only .",
    "for hard x - ray the difference between use of the heavy elements or the light elements is not so significant .",
    "we consider a few examples of the x - ray yield basing on the results obtained above . in fig.1",
    "the spectral distribution of the radiated energy @xmath130",
    "eq.([1 ] ) is shown for li foils ( @xmath131  gev , @xmath132 ) .",
    "the important effect of the dependence of the width and form of the first harmonic peak ( @xmath133  kev ) eq.([6 ] ) on the collimation angle @xmath134 is given .",
    "it is seen that the collimation is cutting out the different parts of the radiation spectrum .",
    "the connection between the frequency and the emission angle is the specific property of the undulator type radiation .",
    "when the collimation angle decreases the spectral peak becomes more narrow ( correspondingly the total number of emitted photons decreases also ) and vise versa .",
    "the curve 5 exhibits the situation when the value @xmath71 is near the boundary value @xmath135 eq.([9 ] ) . for the curve 6 one",
    "has @xmath136 and the spectral curve is independent of the collimation angle .",

    "the width of the peak is practically independent of @xmath2 , while the height is proportional to @xmath2.the peaks of higher harmonics are situated at @xmath142 ( @xmath36=2 , 3 , 4 ) .",
    "their characteristics are : the height @xmath143 and the width @xmath144 ( see eqs.([17]))-([19 ] ) , it is necessary to remind that in figs.1,2 the energy losses spectrum is shown , while these equations are for the probability spectrum ) . note that spectra shown in fig.2(a ) are calculated without absorption . if one takes the absorption into account the higher harmonics will be strongly suppressed .",
    "there is also the hard part of the emitted spectrum which is given in fig.2(b ) .",
    "this is the contribution of the first harmonic ( see eqs.([18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) ) . for @xmath138 the position of the left slope @xmath145  kev ( see eq.([10 ] ) ) . as the collimation becomes more strong the value @xmath146 increases .",
    "note , that the absorption is much weaker for the hard part of the spectrum .    calculating the area of the peak in fig.1,2",
    "one can estimate number of radiated photons per electron @xmath147 , for @xmath138 one has @xmath148 for n=100 .",
    "number of foil @xmath149 is typical in many experiments with the tr detectors , the lithium foils were used in @xcite .",
    "quite good estimation of @xmath147 can be obtained using ( [ 19 ] ) , if @xmath150 , substituting @xmath151 . because of limitations connected with the photon absorption and the multiple scattering of the projectile one have to use the light elements .",
    "there is an opportunity to install the proposed tr radiator in the electron storage ring . in this case",
    "the number @xmath2 will be defined by the storage ring operational regime .",
    "let us note that at @xmath15220 the first harmonic peak is quite distinct .",
