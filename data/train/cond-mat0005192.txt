    "<S> the reptation concept in polymer dynamics is studied for model chains with added stiffness . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea of a chain diffusing inside a tube can be transferred from fully flexible chains although the renormalization onto a flexible chain of fewer kuhn segments fails . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement length shrinks with increasing persistence length . </S>",
    "<S> if entanglement length and persistence length come to the same order of magnitude the picture of a tight tube is better suited , in which chain segments can move only along the contour , any transverse motion being much reduced . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as stiffness increases , the monomers loose their freedom to perform random walks inside the tube , the `` rouse - like '' part of their dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> cite#1    * keywords : * molecular dynamics , polymers    for the dynamics of polymer chains longer than the characteristic entanglement length in the melt the concept of reptation  @xcite is widely accepted . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to short chains which move isotropically and which can be described by the rouse model  @xcite , longer chains are constrained to an effective tube by topological entanglements due to the surrounding chains . </S>",
    "<S> the many chain problem may be replaced by an effective single chain problem with a mean field representation of the neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> this model has been developed for fully flexible polymers and is based on the rouse model for local dynamics , which treats a polymer chain as a set of non - interacting beads connected by springs in a bath of homogeneous friction . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement monomer number @xmath0 is the chain length at which the cross - over from rouse to reptation dynamics occurs.@xcite as chain stiffness is added to the model , the rouse description is no more appropriate for the local dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so it becomes questionable if the standard reptation picture is still suitable for the dynamics of entangled stiff chains . </S>",
    "<S> after some earlier work on the reptation of _ almost rigid _ rods  @xcite , recent theoretical work tries to adapt the reptation model to moderately stiff polymer chains  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective stiffness of a polymer is characterized by its persistence length @xmath1 which is defined as the exponential decay length of orientation correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this is the chain length for which a polymer keeps its orientation . </S>",
    "<S> several theoretical models propose different scalings of the entanglement length with the persistence length stiffness  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is not even consensus whether the entanglement length rises or falls with stiffness . scaling behaviors ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> have been proposed .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this simulation study is to investigate the qualitative change of polymer dynamics from the standard rouse / reptation picture as chain stiffness is introduced and increased . </S>",
    "<S> we show that quantities like the entanglement length or the tube diameter become somewhat diffuse and ambiguous in this case . </S>",
    "<S> still , the concept of an entangled polymer moving in a tube holds ; and irrespective of the way of defining the entanglement length , it can be shown to _ decrease _ with increasing persistence length @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> eventually , the two lengths become comparable and the chain dynamics changes to pure reptation dynamics without an underlying local short - time rouse regime . </S>",
    "<S> one should note that most real polymers have some chain stiffness and they do show local dynamics very similar to our simulations as has been shown in recent nmr experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of entanglements and stiffness is sometimes discussed in terms of a packing length  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally accessible region is , however , much smaller than the parameter area discussed in the following , i.e. in terms of stiffness experimental polymers are less different than they appear on first sight . </S>",
    "<S> yet , simulations and experiments have shown that the rouse model is not fully appropriate for real polymers especially at short ranges where local properties play an increasing role  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we apply a well - described simulation model of polymer dynamics@xcite augmented with intrinsic stiffness@xcite along the polymer backbone . </S>",
    "<S> the chains consist of purely repulsive soft spheres connected by anharmonic springs and a harmonic bond angle potential . </S>",
    "<S> constant temperature is maintained by brownian dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> for details of the simulated systems see ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated systems containing up to 2000 chains of 2 to 1000 monomers of different stiffness ranging from fully flexible to a persistence length of five monomer diameters . the chains with no imposed stiffness ( the original model  @xcite ) have a persistence length of about one monomer diameter resulting from the excluded volume interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the units used in this article are lennard - jones reduced units with monomer mass @xmath4 , monomer diameter @xmath5 and interaction strength @xmath6 set to 1 . for the exact definition and </S>",
    "<S> the potentials see ref .  . </S>",
    "<S> as melts with persistence lengths much larger than five turn nematic  @xcite , they were not investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the time - step was set to 0.01 time units , the density to @xmath7 and the average bond length turns out to be @xmath8 .    mean - squared displacements ( msd ) of central monomers in a chain , in the following referred to as @xmath9 , are a key property both in theory and simulation , as they illustrate the different dynamic regimes of reptation . the dependence of @xmath10 on time scales according to theory with four dynamical exponents in the reptation case  @xcite : at small times the monomers behave as in the rouse model ( @xmath11 ) ; </S>",
    "<S> after the so - called entanglement time @xmath12 , the motion is constrained to a tube , thus the rouse relaxation is one - dimensional along a random walk leading by transformation to three dimensions to @xmath13 ; at the rouse time @xmath14 the internal degrees of freedom are relaxed but the motion is still confined to the tube ( @xmath11 ) ; and after the chain leaves the tube at the disengagement time @xmath15 free diffusion ( @xmath16 ) is observed . this behavior was confirmed by simulations of fully flexible chains  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first three regimes can be seen for the @xmath17 curve in figure  1a .    </S>",
    "<S> depending on stiffness we find two different classes of dynamics . up to a persistence length of @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> the chains behave qualitatively like flexible chains . </S>",
    "<S> chains of length @xmath19 are at the density used clearly entangled for @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> even the chains of length 75 and persistence length of only 1.5 exhibit a slowdown to @xmath22 ( figure  1a ) , which is more pronounced than for fully flexible chains at @xmath19  @xcite .    with increasing persistence length </S>",
    "<S> the value of the mean - squared - displacement value at the crossover @xmath23 from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , which is associated with the square of the tube diameter @xmath26 shrinks slightly . </S>",
    "<S> this is a first indication that the entanglement length ( @xmath27 for flexible chains ) decreases with increasing persistence length . </S>",
    "<S> the time @xmath23 can be transformed into the relaxation time of a chain , from which the entanglement length ( i.e. the number of monomers ) @xmath0 can be obtained.@xcite the rouse model is standardly employed in this mapping procedure . as - in the presence of stiffness - the rouse dynamics is no longer appropriate even for short chains , @xmath0 becomes somewhat ambiguous .    for the system with persistence length @xmath28 </S>",
    "<S> not even the standard reptation scenario is recovered , as the @xmath25 regime is not observed . in the flexible case the tube diameter @xmath29 estimated from the crossover in the msd to @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> is about @xmath30 , and in figure  1a it can be seen that it decreases further with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it can be safely assumed that , for the @xmath31 chains , the tube diameter is equal to or smaller than the persistence length . as a result , stiff chains can not wiggle freely in their tube but have to follow closely the primitive path . </S>",
    "<S> this is in marked contrast to the original rouse / reptation model , in which chains perform a random walk inside their tubes . </S>",
    "<S> now , the chain can only perform reptation moves because there is no transverse freedom to explore . on local scales </S>",
    "<S> , the stiffness hinders the transverse motion and , on longer scales , the entanglements prevent it . </S>",
    "<S> the tube itself appears worm - like rather than like a random walk  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it does not differ much from the chain whose worm - like nature is e.g. visible in its static structure factors  @xcite . still , the limit of persistence length large compared to entanglement length is not approached .    note that the different msds intersect in figure  1a </S>",
    "<S> . the stiffer chains are _ </S>",
    "<S> faster _ in an intermediate regime . for long times ( </S>",
    "<S> not shown ) , however , we expect that the size of the ellipsoid spanned by the chain defines the ultimate diffusion speed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the flexible chains should be faster again . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicated e.g. by comparing the chains with @xmath32 and @xmath31 , where a second intersection is very probable for longer times ( figure  1a ) . a simple argument assuming strictly reptating chains compared to the standard reptation supports this picture : the final diffusion depends only on the extension , so that the stiffer chains are slower . </S>",
    "<S> however , for these chains the first two regimes are missing due to the lack of the rouse regime . </S>",
    "<S> this was confirmed by an analysis of the rouse modes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they start directly with the third regime so that the slowdown to @xmath25 for the flexible chains lets the stiffer chains overtake  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the centers of mass of chains can diffuse `` freely '' in the unentangled case @xmath33 , whereas in the entangled case a sub - diffusive motion arising from the constraining to the curvilinear tube is found up to the rouse time @xmath14 ( figure  1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the chains with @xmath31 and @xmath19 are highly entangled , which is not only visible by the sub - diffusive nature of the msd of the center of mass @xmath34 but also by their reorientation behavior  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> according to the rouse model , the center of mass diffusion coefficient @xmath35 for @xmath36 scales with @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> deviations from this in the long chain regime are normally attributed to entanglements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  2 shows the dependence of @xmath38 on the chain length for different stiffnesses .    </S>",
    "<S> the fully flexible model @xmath17 shows rouse behavior up to @xmath39 and then the diffusion coefficient falls off with @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this picture does not directly extend to higher persistence lengths for which there are again two classes of dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> for persistence length @xmath41 there is a first plateau ( rouse ) at very short chain lengths ( @xmath42 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then the diffusion constant decreases faster than @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> a second short plateau is found ( @xmath43 ) followed by a decay as the entanglement length is approached . for higher </S>",
    "<S> stiffness ( @xmath31 ) no plateau at all is found , indicating that the rouse model can not be applied even for the shortest chains . </S>",
    "<S> for this system , a rouse scaling of the autocorrelation functions of the rouse modes is not possible either  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rouse regime is `` squeezed out '' between the short local modes and the long modes hindered by entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> with increasing @xmath1 longer wavelengths are influenced by stiffness . </S>",
    "<S> as the entanglement length decreases at the same time shorter wavelengths become entangled . </S>",
    "<S> this eventually annihilates the regime of random ( rouse ) motion .    by rescaling the abscissa to match the diffusion coefficient at @xmath44 ( figure  2b ) </S>",
    "<S> one can derive estimates of entanglement lengths : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> for flexible chains the entanglement length coincides with the value derived by the crossover in the @xmath10 function  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the effective entanglement lengths are not as sharply defined as in the flexible case . </S>",
    "<S> even for fully flexible chains there are several definitions of the entanglement length  @xcite , and this ambiguity becomes worse for moderately stiff chains which have two plateaus in @xmath48 </S>",
    "<S> . however , the decrease of @xmath0 with @xmath1 observed is systematic , independent of the details how @xmath0 is actually extracted . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the scaling described above leads to a collapse onto a master curve to a reasonable approximation ( figure  2b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous section showed that stiffness in connection with topological entanglements leads to a novel dynamics of chains in the melt . </S>",
    "<S> the character of the local motions can be investigated in more detail . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function @xmath49 connects the direction of the displacement of a monomer with the local chain direction , where @xmath50 is the second legendre polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> the length of the corresponding chain segment is equal to @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath52 , it is defined by the two nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> this function indicates if the beads move predominantly in the chain direction or if their motion is not correlated to this direction . as the highly entangled @xmath31 systems have fewer transversal degrees of freedom , the correlation is high , signaling a dominance of reptation ( figure  3a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence for a finite correlation length as the maximum correlation is not encountered for @xmath52 at @xmath31 ( figure  3a ) . for @xmath53 ( @xmath54 kuhn segment length ) </S>",
    "<S> the correlation is larger than for @xmath52 and for @xmath55 . at local scales </S>",
    "<S> some transverse degrees of freedom in the tube remain and on the really large scale the _ </S>",
    "<S> static _ structure shines through . </S>",
    "<S> as the statics is not influenced by entanglements , it can be described by a random walk of blobs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  3b provides yet more evidence for the enhancement of reptation by added stiffness : at all times the correlation of motion with chain direction is stronger for @xmath31 than for @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> the tube is visualized in figure  4 . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers denote the positions of the chain end in the order they appear . </S>",
    "<S> the end clearly drags back into the tube and moves out again into a new tube . </S>",
    "<S> note that the figure includes _ all _ monomers without any preaveraging . </S>",
    "<S> one can distinguish stretched segments of the tube in which the chain is also stretched and shows almost no crumpling over the entire simulation . </S>",
    "<S> these rigid segments can undergo a subdiffusive translation while keeping their orientation . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously reptation in the tube is possible . </S>",
    "<S> this illustrates the concept of `` chain reptation without rouse motion '' for stiff polymers .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57{vmd.eps}\\ ] ]    this expresses itself also in the fact that reorientation correlation functions of bond - vectors decay algebraically on short time scales . and monomers propagate through space without losing all of their correlation  @xcite .    from the dynamic structure factor </S>",
    "<S> the tube diameter can be inferred . for rouse dynamics , the structure factor decays uniformly , whereas reptation leads to the development of a plateau . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments showed the presence of reptation e.g. in polyethylene melts  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> it was shown that this discrepancy vanishes only in the limit of very large @xmath60  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the even shorter chains of length 75 , we derive a value of 15.4 , which indicates a tube diameter decreasing with length . </S>",
    "<S> it also decreases with stiffness ; for @xmath31 equation (  [ eq : dynstru ] ) yields 6.1 . however , the fit formula is not really appropriate to the stiff chains as the local rouse dynamics on which it is based is absent ( figure  5b ) . thus , this shows again that these chains are subject to a dynamics which can not be described in terms of standard reptation theory . </S>",

    "<S> note the different scales on the axes.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in spite of this uncertainty the difference is large enough to conclude that also in this case the length scale governing the motion pattern , here @xmath26 , decreases strongly with increasing stiffness .    </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show that the lengths commonly associated with a change in chain diffusion mechanism , the entanglement length @xmath0 and the tube diameter @xmath26 , decrease as the intrinsic stiffness of the chains increases . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the motion patterns change qualitatively already for small stiffness ( persistence length @xmath62 monomer diameters ) and become completely different from that of flexible chains when @xmath0 and/or @xmath26 become comparable to or even smaller than @xmath1 ( as is the case for @xmath31 ) . for @xmath31 , the cooperation of entanglements and stiffness obstructs isotropic random walk motion on all scales , </S>",
    "<S> the rouse regime disappears and the chain reptates along its narrow tube from the beginning . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of rouse dynamics distinguishes this situation from the standard de  gennes - doi - edwards picture  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the term _ strong reptation _ for this scenario . a similar transition has been proposed by morse  @xcite who distinguishes between _ loose _ and _ tight _ entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> one should note that most real polymers do have persistence lengths larger than one monomer diameter . </S>",
    "<S> even something commonly considered flexible like polyisoprene has @xmath63  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that even to such polymers the standard rouse / reptation model can only be applied with caution . </S>",
    "<S> we have found deviations from the predictions of the standard model also for the reorientation of local chain segments  @xcite , which are in good agreement with nmr measurements on polybutadiene melts  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> none of the existing theoretical models can completely explain the observed behavior . </S>",
    "<S> in the low persistence length region the packing length concept  @xcite gives a useful power law dependence @xmath64 but in the region where the two lengths become comparable there is not yet an analytic understanding . </S>"
