    "the _ geometric steiner tree problem _ , which asks for a network with minimum total edge length interconnecting a given set of points ( called _ terminals _ ) , is a well known variant of the _ spanning tree problem_. the steiner tree problem can be viewed as belonging to a family of problems where the aim is to construct a network @xmath4 interconnecting a given set of @xmath5 terminals , with the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath4 may contain nodes ( _ steiner points _ ) other than the given terminals ; 2 .",
    "@xmath4 minimises a given cost function ; 3 .",
    "the given cost function guarantees that @xmath4 can be assumed to be a minimum spanning tree on its nodes ( for a given metric ) .",
    "in addition to the steiner tree problem under various metrics , this family also includes the _",
    "power-@xmath6 steiner tree problem _",
    ", where the cost of each edge of the network is the @xmath6-th power of its length , and the _ bottleneck steiner tree problem _ , where the cost of the network is the length of its longest edge and there is a bound on the number of extra nodes in the network .",
    "both of these variants on the steiner tree problem have numerous applications , particularly in the design of wireless communication networks such as sensor networks .",
    "in contrast to the _ graph steiner problem _ , in the geometric versions of the problem the steiner points may potentially be located at any of an infinite number of points in a given space .",
    "this makes the geometric steiner tree problems , and the methods of finding optimal solutions , fundamentally different from their purely combinatorial analogues . in many versions of the geometric problem",
    "it is not even immediately clear how an optimal solution can be calculated .",
    "although the spanning tree problem is polynomially solvable , being solvable in @xmath1 time in a general metric and in @xmath7 time in the euclidean plane , see @xcite , the problems in this more general family are mostly @xmath8-hard , even in the plane .",
    "this essentially stems from the fact that as the number of extra nodes that can be added to the network increases there is an exponential explosion in the number of different topologies that need to be considered .",
    "a natural way of controlling this increase in complexity is to bound the number of extra nodes , in other words , replace property  1 above by the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath4 may contain up to @xmath2 nodes other than the given terminals , where @xmath2 is a constant positive integer .",
    "we refer to problems in this modified class as _ generalised @xmath2-steiner tree problems_. one of the seminal papers on this topic , for the @xmath0-steiner tree problem in the euclidean plane , is a paper by georgakopoulos and papadimitriou @xcite , where an @xmath1-time solution is given .",
    "they conclude their paper with a tantalising comment relating to their unsuccessful attempts at generalising their methodology to the @xmath2-steiner tree problem , even for @xmath9 . this comment has been a motivating factor for the current paper .",
    "also , in their paper the proofs of some of the primary results and sufficient details are omitted ; another aim of this paper is to add some rigour to the more fundamental of these results .",
    "it should be noted that solutions to @xmath2-steiner problems are fundamentally different to the analogous classical steiner problems where the number of steiner points is not bounded .",
    "a case in point is the package of exact algorithms called geosteiner of warme , winter , zachariasen ( see @xcite for one of the companion papers ) for constructing optimal euclidean and rectilinear steiner trees . for a variety of reasons these algorithms",
    "can not simply be adapted to solve the respective @xmath2-steiner problems , whilst maintaining efficiency .",
    "a fundamental obstacle in the euclidean plane is the fact that the degrees of steiner points can be @xmath10 when @xmath2 is bounded , so many of the nice geometric properties utilised in geosteiner are lost .",
    "we may restate the goal of the georgakopoulos and papadimitriou paper as follows : find the point in the euclidean plane which , if added to a given set of points , will result in the shortest possible spanning tree .",
    "the authors observed that one can significantly reduce the time complexity of an algorithmic solution to the problem by first constructing a special partition .",
    "given a set @xmath11 of @xmath5 terminals in the euclidean plane , it is possible to partition the plane into @xmath1 regions such that if any new point @xmath12 is embedded in the plane within one of these regions , say @xmath13 , then any minimum spanning tree @xmath4 on @xmath14 will have the following property : the neighbours of @xmath12 in @xmath4 will belong to some subset of a set @xmath15 containing at most six points from @xmath11 , where @xmath15 is fixed for the given region @xmath13 .",
    "this useful partition is referred to as the _ overlayed oriented dirichlet cell partition _ , or oodc partition .",
    "their algorithm takes as input the set @xmath11 of terminals and then starts by calculating the oodc partition , the set @xmath15 for every @xmath13 , and a minimum spanning tree @xmath16 on @xmath11 .",
    "all this , as well as a preprocessing step on @xmath16 , is done within a time of @xmath1 . for each region @xmath13",
    ", the algorithm then iterates through all subsets @xmath17 of @xmath15 and calculates @xmath12 , the steiner point of the nodes in @xmath17 ( this takes constant time for each @xmath17 ) .",
    "the algorithm then updates @xmath16 ( which can also be done in constant time because of the preprocessing step ) to include @xmath12 .",
    "the cheapest tree is selected at the end as an optimal solution . a naive algorithm for",
    "the @xmath0-steiner tree problem would attain a complexity of @xmath18 since it would have to iterate through _ all _ subsets of up to six terminals and then calculate the optimal position of the steiner point and the corresponding minimum spanning tree for each of these subsets .",
    "the powerful simplifying properties of the oodc would clearly be advantageous in a generalisation of the algorithm to arbitrary normed planes .",
    "however , the construction of the oodc partition given in @xcite is valid for the euclidean plane only",
    ". we will provide a new method , based on abstract voronoi diagrams , for constructing the partition for terminals embedded in an arbitrary normed plane .",
    "the construction is based on theoretical results , but we also define a class of norms for which the algorithm would be practically implementable .",
    "once the partition has been found , our algorithm calculates the optimal positions of all @xmath2 steiner points simultaneously .",
    "of course , these positions will depend not only on the neighbours of the steiner points , but also on the cost function of the given generalised steiner tree problem . since , at the start of this step , the neighbours of the steiner points are fixed but the steiner points are free , this subproblem is a generalised version of the well - known _ fixed topology steiner tree problem _ ( discussed in section [ topology3 ] ) . since @xmath2 is constant",
    "we assume that this step can be done in constant time . a novel method for updating",
    "a minimum spanning tree is then utilised to calculate a potential solution for every choice of coordinates of the steiner points . once again , a cheapest tree is selected as the optimal solution .",
    "the total time complexity turns out to be @xmath3 when constant factors are excluded .",
    "there are a number of authors who have looked at adapting the solution to the @xmath0-steiner tree problem in @xcite to other @xmath19 norms .",
    "kahng and robins in @xcite do this for the rectilinear plane , however , their paper only uses the solution as a step in a heuristic algorithm for the rectilinear steiner tree problem , and not much attention is devoted to the solution of the @xmath0-steiner tree problem itself .",
    "griffith et al .",
    "@xcite expand on this heuristic idea in the rectilinear plane .",
    "they provide a simple procedure ( though without proof ) for updating a minimum spanning tree when a new node is introduced .",
    "lin et al .",
    "@xcite in turn adapt the approach presented by kahn and robins to the norm induced by a regular hexagon .",
    "recent papers @xcite by bae et al .",
    "provide the first exact algorithms for solving the _ bottleneck _ @xmath2-steiner tree problem in the @xmath19 planes .",
    "the complexity of their algorithms are @xmath20 when @xmath21 and @xmath22 for all other finite @xmath6 .",
    "however , the methods they use are based on farthest colour voronoi diagrams and therefore can not be utilised for any other cost functions .",
    "besides these authors we are not aware of any significant study into the properties and construction of optimal geometric @xmath2-steiner trees . although the classical steiner tree problem ( where the number of steiner points is not bounded ) has been considered in a multitude of norms and under many cost functions , these results are mostly irrelevant to the @xmath2-steiner problem .",
    "section [ prelim1 ] provides some preliminary definitions .",
    "our algorithm for solving the generalised @xmath2-steiner tree problem in normed planes has three primary phases .",
    "the first phase constructs a set of _ feasible internal topologies_. each feasible internal topology is a forest with leaves only from the set @xmath11 of terminals , and interior nodes only from the set @xmath23 of steiner points . at this stage",
    "the nodes of @xmath23 are not yet located in the plane . by utilising oodc partitions , as discussed in section [ odc2 ] , we are able to significantly reduce the total number of feasible internal topologies . in section [ odc2 ]",
    "we also present three restrictions on the given normed plane that allows the construction of the oodc partition to be implemented in practice .",
    "the next phase of our algorithm consists of finding the optimal locations in the plane of the nodes of @xmath23 for each feasible internal topology .",
    "this is known in the literature as the _ fixed topology steiner tree problem _ , and its solution depends crucially on the cost function @xmath24 and on the given normed plane .",
    "we briefly discuss this phase of the algorithm again in section [ topology3 ] .",
    "the final phase is to add each feasible internal topology ( with steiner points optimally located ) to a minimum spanning tree on @xmath11 .",
    "the union of these two graphs produces cycles and thus a method is needed for deleting the appropriate edges from the union until an optimal final tree is attained .",
    "this so called _ minimum spanning tree update _",
    "method is the topic of section [ mst4 ] . in section [ algorithm5 ]",
    "we present our main algorithm and then prove its correctness and verify its time complexity .",
    "we begin by formalising the definition of a generalised @xmath2-steiner tree problem , sketched in the introduction . throughout this paper",
    "we use the symbols @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the edge - set and node - set respectively of a graph @xmath27 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be given .",

    "the _ unit ball _",
    "@xmath41 is a centrally symmetric convex set .",
    "given a set @xmath42 , let @xmath43 represent the set of all spanning trees for the elements of @xmath44 .",
    "for each @xmath45 there is a corresponding set of edges @xmath46 ( with every @xmath47 ) .",
    "let @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , represent an embedding of the set @xmath50 in @xmath31 ( where @xmath51 is an embedding of the corresponding @xmath52 ) .",
    "we can think of @xmath45 as representing the topology of a tree network interconnecting @xmath11 and using @xmath53 extra nodes , and we can equate the edges @xmath54 with the arcs of such a network . for a fixed embedding of this network we let @xmath55 , with @xmath49 , be the locations of the extra nodes corresponding to @xmath56 .",
    "we refer to @xmath11 as the set of _ terminals _ and @xmath23 as the set of _ steiner points _ of the network .",
    "now let @xmath57 ; i.e. , the components of @xmath58 are the edge lengths of such a network , for a given tree topology and a given set of embedded nodes .",
    "such a vector is well defined up to the order of its components .",
    "let @xmath59 be a symmetric function ( i.e. , independent of the order of the components of the vector on which it acts ) .",
