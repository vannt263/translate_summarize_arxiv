    "dust grains are formed at the end of the stellar life ; in the stellar wind of asymptotic giant branch stars ( e.g. , ferrarotti & gail 2006 ) , in the stellar ejecta of supernovae ( e.g. , nozawa et al .",
    "2003 , rho et al .",
    "2008 ) , and so on .",
    "some of the grains grow in molecular clouds ( e.g. , draine 1990 ) .",
    "some of them are destroyed by the interstellar shock ( e.g. , williams , et al . 2006 ) .",
    "some of them may go out from the parent galaxy and reach the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( e.g. , aguirre et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "the igm is the medium between galaxies , and it occupies almost the whole volume of the universe .",
    "the mean density of the igm is as low as @xmath16@xmath17 @xmath2 .",
    "as found by gunn & peterson ( 1965 ) , the igm is highly ionized after the cosmic reionization epoch ( the redshift @xmath1810 ; loeb & barkana 2001 , fan , carilli , & keating 2006 ) . thus",
    ", its temperature is @xmath19 k. the igm is filled with the ionizing ultra - violet ( uv ) and x - ray background radiation which is produced by qsos and galaxies ( e.g. , haardt & madau 1996 ) .",
    "a significant amount of metals is found in the igm ( e.g. , aguirre et al .",
    "multiple supernova explosions ( sn ) caused by an active star - formation in galaxies can eject the metal elements to the igm .",
    "however , ferrara , pettini , & shchekinov ( 2000 ) showed that the metal enrichment of the igm by sn explosions is limited in relatively small regions around star - forming galaxies and an additional physical mechanism is required to explain the observed global enrichment of metals in the igm .",
    "dust grains expelled from galaxies by the radiation pressure due to stellar light and by the galactic wind due to multiple sne may contribute to the metal enrichment in the igm ( e.g. , aguirre et al .",
    "2001a , b ) .",
    "bianchi & ferrara ( 2005 ) showed that relatively large ( @xmath20 @xmath14 m ) dust grains are not completely destroyed and reach a significant distance ( a few @xmath21 kpc ) although the amount of this intergalactic dust is too small to make a detectable extinction .",
    "infrared ( ir ) emission from dust grains in the igm surrounding edge - on galaxies has been already detected ( e.g. , alton , davies , & bianchi 1999 , bendo et al .",
    "moreover , ir emission from dust in the igm accumulated from the distant universe may affect the cosmic far - infrared background and the cosmic microwave background ( aguirre & haiman 2000 ) .",
    "emission signature from dust even at the epoch of the cosmic reionization may be detectable with a future satellite observing the cosmic microwave background ( elfgren , dsert , & guiderdoni 2007 ) .",
    "xilouris et al .  (",
    "2006 ) found a significant reddening of galaxies behind the m81 group igm which is detected by hi 21 cm emission ( e.g. , yun , ho , & lo 1994 ) .",
    "their measurements imply the dust - to - gas ratio in the m81 group igm is a factor of 5 larger than that in the milky way .",
    "such a large amount of dust in the igm may be ejected from m82 by its intense starburst activity ( alton et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "dust in the igm affects results from the precision cosmology .",
    "indeed , high redshift sne ia are dimmed by dust in the igm , and then , the observational estimate of the distance to them and cosmological parameters become ambiguous ( goobar , bergstrm , & mrtsell 2002 ) . furthermore",
    ", future investigations of the equation of state of the dark energy will be affected by the extinction of the intergalactic dust even if its amount is too small to affect the conclusion of the presence of the dark energy ( carasaniti 2006 , zhang & corasaniti 2007 ) .",
    "dust in the igm also affects the thermal history of the igm . in the intracluster medium ,",
    "dust grains work as a coolant because they emit energy obtained from gas particles collisionally as the thermal ir radiation ( montier & giard 2004 ) .",
    "such emission from some nearby galaxy clusters can be detectable with the current and future satellites for the ir observations ( yamada & kitayama 2005 ) .",
    "dust grains in the igm also work as a heating source via the photoelectric effect ( nath , sethi & shchekinov 1999 ) .",
    "inoue & kamaya ( 2003 , 2004 ) proposed a possibility to obtain an upper limit of the amount of the intergalactic dust based on the thermal history of the igm with the dust photoelectric heating .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the effect of the dust photoelectric heating in the igm .",
    "recently , weingartner et al .  ( 2006 ) revised the model of the photoelectric yield of dust grains .",
    "they included a few new physical processes ; the photon and electron transfer in a grain , the photoelectron emission from the inner shells of the constituent atoms of grains , the secondary electron emission , and the auger electron emission .",
    "these new features reduce the photoelectric yield for moderate energy photons of @xmath22 ev but enhance the yield for high energy photons of @xmath23 kev . in particular",
    ", we explore the effect of the new yield model on the photoelectric heating by the intergalactic dust in this paper .",
    "the rest of this paper consists of four sections ; in  2 , we describe the model of the photoelectric effect . in  3 , we compare heating rates of the photoelectric effect with those of the photoionization in the igm . in  4 , we discuss the implications of the results of  3 .",
    "final section is devoted for our conclusions .",
    "to examine the photoelectric effect , we must specify the charge of grains which is given by the following equation ( spitzer 1941 , draine & salpeter 1979 ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the grain charge in the electron charge unit , @xmath26 is the collisional charging rate by @xmath27-th charged particle ( hereafter the subscript `` @xmath27 '' means `` @xmath27-th charged particle '' ) , and @xmath28 is the photoelectric charging rate .",
    "we consider only protons and electrons as the charged particle .      the collisional charging rate by @xmath27-th charged particle , @xmath26 , is expressed as ( e.g. , draine & sutin 1987 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the charge in the electron charge unit , @xmath31 is the sticking coefficient , @xmath32 is the number density , @xmath33 is the velocity , @xmath34 is the collisional cross section depending on the grain radius , @xmath35 , both charges , and the velocity , and @xmath36 is the velocity distribution function . if the grain and the charged particle have the charges of the same sign , the kinetic energy of the particle must exceed the grain electric potential for the collision . otherwise , the collisional cross section is zero .",
    "we simply assume @xmath31 is always unity .",
    "now , we introduce the dimensionless cross section , @xmath37 . if we neglect the `` image potential '' resulting from the polarization of the grain induced by the coulomb field of the approaching charged particle ( draine & sutin 1987 ) and we assume the maxwellian velocity distribution for the particle and the spherical grains , we obtain @xmath38 and @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath10 is the gas temperature , @xmath41 is the particle mass , and @xmath42 ( spitzer 1941 ) .",
    "in fact , the `` image potential '' works to enhance the collisional cross section ( draine & sutin 1987 ) .",
    "although the effect becomes the most important for grains with an around neutral charge , it quickly declines for highly charged grains . indeed , for the charge ratio of @xmath43 , which is satisfied in our case as found below , the increment factor for the cross section by the effect of the `` image potential '' is less than 1.5 ( draine & sutin 1987 ) .",
    "therefore , we neglect the `` image potential '' in this paper .      the photoelectric charging rate is given by ( e.g. , draine 1978 ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the absorption coefficient of grains at the frequency @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the photoelectric yield , @xmath48 is the mean intensity of the incident radiation , and @xmath49 is the plank constant . for @xmath45 , we adopt the values of `` graphite '' and `` uv smoothed astronomical silicate '' by draine ( 2003 ) .",
    "if the photon energy is smaller than the threshold energy of the photoelectric emission , e.g. , the ionization potential or the work function , the yield @xmath50 .",
    "we adopt a sophisticated model of the photoelectric yield by weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) and weingartner et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in this paper .",
    "the model of weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) ( hereafter wd01 model ) takes into account the primary photoelectron emission from the band structure of grains , a small - size particle effect , and the energy distribution of the photoelectron . on the other hand , weingartner et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ( hereafter w+06 model ) add the primary photoelectron emission from inner shells of the constituent atoms of grains , the auger electron emission , and the secondary electron emission produced by primary electrons and auger electrons . the transfer of photons absorbed and electrons emitted in a grain is also taken into account . the detailed procedure of the yield calculations is referred to the original papers of weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) and weingartner et al .",
    ".  1 shows comparisons between the wd01 and w+06 models .",
    "the reduction of the w+06 yield around 100 ev is due to the effect of the photon / electron transfer in a grain .",
    "the w+06 yield exceeds unity for some cases because of the auger and secondary electrons .",
    "m neutral ( a ) graphite and ( b ) silicate grains .",
    "the dotted lines are the wd01 model ( weingartner & draine 2001 ) and the solid lines are the w+06 model ( weingartner et al .  2006 ) .",
    "the w+06 model consists of three processes : the primary photoelectron emission ( short dashed line ) , the secondary electron emission ( long dashed line ) , and the auger electron emission ( dot - dashed line).,width=264 ]    we have to note that there is still a large uncertainty of photoelectric yield models because of our insufficient understandings of the nature of small - size particle effect as well as the lack of experiments .",
    "abbas et al .  ( 2006 ) reported measurements of the yield of individual grains of silica , olivine , and graphite with 0.095 @xmath14 m radii for 810 ev photons .",
    "their measurements indeed show larger yields than those of the bulk materials .",
    "however , the measurements do not agree with the yield enhancement factors adopted in wd01 and w+06 models accounting for the small - size particle effect qualitatively as well as quantitatively .",
    "clearly , we need more experiments and theoretical investigations of the photoelectric yield in future .",
    "we need to specify the radiation filed incident on grains in the igm : the cosmic background radiation .",
    "we assume a simple prescription of the radiation .",
    "the intensity of the radiation at the lyman limit is estimated from observations of the proximity effect and the lyman @xmath51 forest opacity ( e.g. , scott et al .",
    "a typical value of the intensity at the lyman limit is @xmath52 erg s@xmath1 @xmath53 hz@xmath1 sr@xmath1 ( e.g. , scott et al .",
    "we simply assume a power - law as the spectral shape : @xmath54 .",
    "a typical value of @xmath55 is unity ( e.g. , haardt & madau 1996 ) .",
    "with such a radiation filed , the grains in the igm are positively charged .",
    "a typical charging time - scale is very short . for example",
    ", the collisional charging rate of electron , @xmath56 s@xmath1 for @xmath57 @xmath2 , @xmath58 k , @xmath59 @xmath14 m , and @xmath60 , which is the equilibrium charge of graphite or silicate grains for these parameters and @xmath61 erg s@xmath1 @xmath53 hz@xmath1 sr@xmath1 .",
    "thus , the typical charging time - scale is @xmath62 yr .",
    "therefore , the grain charge can be in equilibrium .",
    "we set @xmath63 in equation ( 1 ) and obtain the equilibrium charge of the igm grains .",
    "the net heating rate per a grain with the radius @xmath35 is expressed as ( e.g. , weingartner & draine 2001 ) @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the mean kinetic energy of photoelectrons from a grain with the radius @xmath35 and @xmath66 is that of electrons colliding with the grain .",
    "the second term accounts for the cooling by the electron capture .",
    "if we assume the maxwellian velocity distribution for the electrons , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 ( for @xmath69 ; draine 1978 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath70 is @xmath71% of @xmath72 in the current setting .",
    "the mean energy of the photoelectrons is given by @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the photoelectric yield of @xmath76-th emission process , e.g. , primary electrons from the band structure , auger electron , etc . , and",
    "@xmath77 is the mean energy of electrons emitted by @xmath76-th process with the absorbed photon energy @xmath78 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath77 is based on the assumed energy distribution of the electrons .",
    "following weingartner et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we adopt a parabolic function for the primary and the auger electrons and a function introduced by draine & salpeter ( 1979 ) for the secondary electrons , which were derived to fit some experimental results .    in the igm ,",
    "the grains are positively charged .",
    "then , the proton collisional charging rate is negligible .",
    "thus , the photoelectric charging rate balances with the electron collisional charging rate : @xmath79 . in this case ,",
    "equation ( 6 ) is reduced to @xmath80 where we have used equations ( 24 ) for @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the grain electric potential ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 for the igm ) . as found later in fig .  2",
    ", the electric potential depends on the grain size weakly in the w+06 yield case .",
    "we confirmed that the mean energy of photoelectrons also depends on the grain size weakly . as a result ,",
    "the heating rate per a grain is roughly proportional to the square of the size , which is shown later in fig .",
    "3 .      to estimate the total photoelectric heating rate per unit volume , we need to specify the amount and the size distribution of dust grains .",
    "a power law type distribution for grain size is familiar in the interstellar medium of the milky way since classical work by mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck ( 1977 ; hereafter mrn ) .",
    "power law is expected to be achieved by resulting from coagulation , shattering , and sputtering processes ( e.g. , jones , tielens , & hollenbach 1996 ) . here",
    "we express the power law distribution as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the number density of grains with the radius between @xmath35 and @xmath87 .",
    "for the mrn distribution , @xmath88 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the normalization @xmath89 is determined from the total dust mass density @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the mass of grains with the radius @xmath35 , @xmath92 @xmath93 is the grain material density , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the minimum and maximum radius , respectively . the dust mass density @xmath96 is given by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the proton mass , @xmath8 is the hydrogen number density , and @xmath7 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "we assume @xmath12 , which is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the milky way s ism .",
    "then , the total photoelectric heating rate is @xmath99    let us consider a typical size for the total heating rate . using the grain number density @xmath100 , we can define a mean heating rate per a grain as @xmath101 and a mean mass per a grain as @xmath102 . then",

    "then , we obtain @xmath106 where a typical size @xmath107 is given by @xmath108 note that a larger typical size results in a smaller total heating rate because of a smaller number density of grains for a fixed dust mass .      for comparison with the photoelectric heating rate by grains",
    ", we estimate the photoionization heating rates of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the net hi photoionization heating rate is @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the hi photoionization rate , @xmath111 is the hi recombination rate , @xmath112 is the mean kinetic energy of the hi photoionized electrons , @xmath113 is the hi photoionization cross section , @xmath114 is the hi lyman limit frequency , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 are the neutral hydrogen , ionized hydrogen , and electron number densities , respectively , @xmath118 is the case a hi recombination coefficient for the gas temperature @xmath10 ( osterbrock & ferland 2006 ) , and @xmath119 is the mean kinetic energy lost from the gas per one recombination . if we assume that @xmath120 and @xmath121 , we obtain @xmath122 .",

    ", we compare the electric potentials of the w+06 model ( solid lines ) with those of the wd01 model ( dashed lines ) .",
    "we showed two cases of the spectrum of the radiation field ; one has a hard spectrum as a background radiation dominated by qsos which is the case with the spectral index @xmath138 , and the other has a soft spectrum with @xmath132 for a comparison .",
    "other assumed quantities are appropriate for the igm at the redshift @xmath139 and shown in the panels .",
    "the radiation fields assumed here correspond to the ionization parameter @xmath140 , which is the number density ratio of ionizing photons and hydrogen nucleus , of 6.3 for @xmath138 and of 1.3 for @xmath132 .",

    "6 and 7 with @xmath141100 .",
    "we find that our calculations are quantitatively well matched with theirs .",
    "we find in fig .  2 that for the hard spectrum case , the grain electric potentials with the w+06 yield model are much smaller than those with the wd01 model , especially for larger grain sizes .",
    "on the other hand , for the soft spectrum case , the difference is very small , less than 4% .",
    "this is because the main difference between the w+06 yield and the wd01 yield is found in the primary photoelectron yield at @xmath22 ev due to the photon / electron transfer in a grain as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in the soft spectrum case , since there are not many photons around the energy , we do not find a significant difference between the two yield models . for smaller grain sizes ,",
    "the yield reduction by the photon / electron transfer is small as found in figs .  4 and 5 of weingartner et al .",
    "thus , we do not find a significant difference in the electric potentials for smaller grain sizes in fig .  2 , either .",

    "thus , the temperature of the gas far away the sources is kept to be that of the cosmic background radiation at the epoch : @xmath212 k. the electron fraction @xmath201 , i.e. the number density of electron relative to that of hydrogen nucleus , is @xmath213 in this low temperature igm ( galli & palla 1998 ) . the nonionizing uv photons still cause the photoelectric effect of grains . in the assumed setting ,",
    "we have found that grains are positively charged and the dust photoelectric heating rate becomes @xmath214 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 for the mrn size distribution with a graphite and silicate mixture ( 50% each in mass ) .",
    "we compare this heating rate with the gas thermal energy density : @xmath215 .",
    "the time - scale doubling the gas temperature with the photoelectric heating is given by @xmath216 yr since the age of the universe at @xmath217 is about @xmath218 yr , we conclude that the dust photoelectric heating is not very efficient in this case although it may be the strongest heating mechanism for the igm .    in the case with the additional x - ray background radiation , the igm is partially ionized by the x - ray and the temperature becomes @xmath19 k ( e.g. , venkatesan et al .",
    "if we assume the ionization equilibrium and optically thin for the x - ray , the electron fraction becomes @xmath219 for the current setting of the x - ray background .",
    "in this medium , the grains are positively charged and the dust photoelectric heating rate becomes @xmath220 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 . we have assumed the mrn size distribution with a graphite and silicate mixture ( 50% each in mass ) , again . however , the hi photoionization heating is much more efficient as @xmath221 erg s@xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we again conclude that the dust photoelectric heating is negligible in the early universe filled with an x - ray background radiation .",
    "we have updated our calculations made in inoue & kamaya ( 2003,2004 ) of the dust photoelectric heating in the igm with the new model of the dust photoelectric yield by weingartner et al .",
    "this new yield model takes into account the effect of the photon and electron transfer in a grain , the photoelectric emission from inner shells of grain constituent atoms , the auger electron emission , and the secondary electron emission . a comparison with the previous yield model by weingartner & draine ( 2001 )",
    "show that the new yield is smaller than the old one for @xmath22 ev photons .",
    "this reduction of the yield is due to the photon / electron transfer effect , and reduces the electric potential on grains and the heating rate significantly .",
    "for example , if we integrate over the grain size with the standard mrn distribution , the dust photoelectric heating rate with the new yield model is a factor of 24 smaller than that with the old yield model .",
    "the photoelectric heating rate is more important in lower density medium .",
    "if the dust - to - gas ratio in the igm is 1% of that in the milky way and the size distribution is the standard mrn model , the dust heating rate dominates the hi and heii photoionization heating rates when the gas number density is less than @xmath11 @xmath2 even with the new yield model .",
    "we have examined the effect of the size distribution function on the heating rate because the heating rate is inversely proportional to the typical grain size as found in equation ( 11 ) .",
    "bianchi & ferrara ( 2005 ) suggested that the size of the intergalactic dust is larger than @xmath170 @xmath14 m because smaller grains are destroyed by sputtering in the hot gas halo during the transport of grains from the parent galaxy to the igm . in this case , the heating rate is reduced by a factor of @xmath222 relative to that with the standard mrn size distribution .",
    "the size distributions expected by the dust formation model in supernova ejecta are also examined .",
    "the heating rate with the size distribution of the grains just produced in the ejecta is very similar to that with the mrn distribution .",
    "in contrast , the heating rate with the size distribution of the grains processed by the reverse shock in the supernova remnant is a factor of @xmath223 smaller than that with the mrn model .",
    "the shock processed grains have larger size than the pristine ones because smaller grains are destroyed . on the other hand , if we put only small grains in the igm , the heating rate increases significantly .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the size distribution of grains in the igm is an essential parameter for determining the dust heating efficiency . even in the worst case considered here , the dust heating is expected to be the dominant heating mechanism in the igm at @xmath153 if the dust - to - gas ratio in the igm is 1% of that in the milky way .",
    "since the dust photoelectric heating rate with the new yield model is reduced by a factor of 24 relative to that with the old yield model , the upper limit on the amount of the intergalactic dust obtained by inoue & kamaya ( 2003,2004 ) may be affected .",
    "indeed , the limit based on the thermal history of the igm should be raised by a few factor .",
    "however , their final upper limit is mainly obtained from the reddening measurements of @xmath189 supernovae ia .",
    "therefore , their conclusion would not be affected very much .",
    "bolton et al .  ( 2008 ) suggested an inverted temperature  density relation in the lower density igm at @xmath1903 based on recent observations of the lyman @xmath51 forest in qsos spectra . to explain this interesting phenomenon",
    ", we need a heating mechanism more efficient in a lower density medium .",
    "the dust photoelectric heating has such a property . indeed , the dust heating rate even with the new yield model is a factor of 2 larger than the heii photoionization heating rate in a medium with a density of 1/10 of the mean in the universe at @xmath190 if the dust - to - gas ratio is 1% of that in the milky way .",
    "thus , the possibility of the dust heating is worth examining more in detail . for this aim , the simple formula describing the dust photoelectric heating in the igm presented in equation ( 16 ) will be very useful .",
    "finally , we have discussed the effect of the dust photoelectric heating in the early universe . before the cosmic reionization",
    ", the ionizing background radiation is not established , but there may be nonionizing uv background and x - ray background radiations . in the low temperature igm only with a nonionizing uv background radiation ,",

    "the hi photoionization heating rate is three orders of magnitude larger than the dust heating rate if the dust - to - gas ratio is 1% of that in the milky way .",
