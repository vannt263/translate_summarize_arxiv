    "the measurement of mass - loss rates for f  m dwarf stars and the development of theoretical models to predict these rates have challenged observers and theoreticians for many years . while _ in situ _ measurements of the solar - wind mass flux have been available since the early space age , such measurements are not feasible for other stars .",
    "instead , @xcite showed that astrospheric absorption in the stellar lyman-@xmath0 emission line provides a sensitive tool for measuring stellar mass - loss rates of late - type dwarf stars .",
    "although other techniques have been proposed , including the search for charge - exchange - induced x - ray emission @xcite and free - free emission at radio wavelengths @xcite , the lyman-@xmath0 astrospheres technique is presently the only technique that provides credible results .",
    "we describe this technique in section  2 , present an alternative way for explaining the empirical relation of mass loss to x - ray flux in section  3 , and identify some critical issues in section  4 .",
    "the interaction of ionized stellar - wind plasma with inflowing , mostly neutral , interstellar gas leads to a rich phenomenology .",
    "figure 1 shows an example of a hydrodynamic model of the heliosphere computed by @xcite .",
    "the salient features of this model and other models of the heliosphere and astrospheres is the presence of a termination shock where the solar wind becomes subsonic , a heliopause / astropause that separates ionized solar / stellar wind plasma from charge - exchanged local interstellar medium ( lism ) ions , and the so - called hydrogen wall where inflowing neutral hydrogen gas piles up , is decelerated , and is heated by the charge - exchange reactions .",
    "ibex results @xcite indicate that the inflow velocity of the lism is likely too slow to produce a bow shock , however @xcite argue that inclusion of inflowing he@xmath1 ions yields alfvn and fast magnetosonic speeds slower than the inflow speed and thus a bow shock . as first predicted by @xcite ,",
    "hydrogen walls provide the observational basis for measuring stellar mass - loss rates .",
    "however , the small hydrogen column densities in these astrosphere regions , @xmath214.015.0 , means that optical depths in neutral metal lines also formed in these regions will be too small to detect , leaving lyman-@xmath0 as the only available spectral diagnostic for measuring stellar mass - loss rates .",
    "figure 2 shows the effect of neutral hydrogen absorption from the lism and in the hydrogen walls of the star and the sun on the lyman-@xmath0 emission line emitted by a star .",
    "since the hydrogen wall gas is decelerated relative to the lism gas , the solar hydrogen wall appears as extra absorption on the red side of the lism absorption , and the stellar hydrogen wall viewed from outside of the star appears as extra absorption on the blue side of the lism absorption .",
    "figure  3 shows the effects of increasing stellar mass - loss rate on the stellar hydrogen - wall absorption computed with hydrodynamic astrosphere models @xcite .",
    "this technique has been successfully applied to 15 stars or binary systems that are relatively close ( @xmath3  pc ) , with relatively small lism neutral hydrogen column densities [ @xmath4 .",
    "clearly , the lism gas must contain a significant amount of neutral hydrogen for the development of a hydrogen wall and for this technique to work .",
    "lyman-@xmath0 observations of more stars are needed , but observational limitations will restrict the number of stellar winds that could be measured by this technique .",
    "@xcite proposed that the mass - loss rate per unit stellar surface area ( @xmath5 ) measurements for g and k dwarf stars shown in fig .",
    "4 can be fit by a power law , @xmath6 , for x - ray surface fluxes @xmath7 erg  @xmath8  s@xmath9 .",
    "while the fit looks good considering the roughly factor of two uncertainties in the mass - loss rate measurements and the varying x - ray fluxs that were measured at different times , there is no accepted explanation for this power - law relation .",
    "we therefore propose an alternative way of characterizing these data that suggests a physical scenario that could explain these results .",
    "we start by separating the data into three groups rather than by assuming a power - law relation .",
    "group 1 includes the sun and four other stars ( 61 vir , the unresolved binary @xmath0  cen  ab , @xmath10  ind , and 61  cyg  a ) .",
    "all of these stars are slow rotators ( 2242 day periods ) , most have solar - like mass - loss rates ( per unit surface area ) , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 in the range @xmath13@xmath14 ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and others have shown that the solar mass - loss rate is uncorrelated with @xmath12 , although both @xmath5 and @xmath12 vary by over a factor of 10 . the average solar mass loss rate ( @xmath15 yr@xmath9 ) , however , is independent of @xmath12 despite the very different number of active regions on the solar disk at times of solar activity minima and maxima .",
    "group 2 consists of two stars and two unresolved binary systems with @xmath12 in the narrow range 35@xmath16 ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath9 .",
    "the two stars ( @xmath10  eri and @xmath17  boo  b ) are moderate speed rotators ( @xmath18=11.68 and 11.5 days , respectively ) .",
    "the other two targets are unresolved binaries ( 70  oph ab and 36  oph ab ) with rotational periods in the range 19.722.9 days and measured mass - loss rates only for the binary systems rather than for the individual stars .",
    "the third group of g  k dwarf stars consists of @xmath19  uma @xcite and @xmath17  boo  a @xcite .",
    "these stars are rapid rotators ( @xmath18 = 4.69 and 6.2 days , respectively ) , have large @xmath20 ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath9 , but small mass - loss rates similar to the sun .",
    "we note that these mass - loss rates are a factor of 100 times smaller than theoretical estimates for @xmath19  uma @xcite and for @xmath21  boo , an f7  v star with @xmath22 days @xcite .    the very different behavior between mass loss , which emerges only along open magnetic - field lines , and x - ray flux , which is emitted mostly in closed magnetic - field regions with high electron densities , likely depends on the energy available for driving mass loss at the coronal base of open field lines , the number of open field lines , and the divergence of the open field lines with height in the corona .",
    "while detailed theoretical studies of wind acceleration mechanisms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and coronal magnetic - field morphologies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are needed , we outline here a simple physical model that may explain the complex relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath12 shown in fig .  4 .",
    "@xcite showed that for the sun , the mass flux along an open magnetic - field line is proportional to the magnetic - field strength at its coronal base footpoint . since the coronal base magnetic - field strength near active regions is much larger than for high - latitude coronal holes , the mass flux in field lines located near active regions is much larger than for open field regions away from active regions ( e.g. , polar holes ) .",
    "however , the divergence of field lines emerging from near active regions is much larger than for open field regions away from active regions . as a result ,",
    "the greater divergence of field lines from active regions compensates for the larger mass flux in these field lines leading to the same average solar mass - loss rate even when the surface coverage of active regions changes as indicated by a factor of 10 range in @xmath12 .",
    "this explanation for the nearly constant value of @xmath5 over at least a factor of 10 range in @xmath12 seen in the solar data likely also explains the results for the other group 1 stars .",
    "for the faster rotating stars in group 2 , especially @xmath10  eri and @xmath17  boo  b , the much stronger magnetic dynamo produces much larger magnetic fluxes @xcite .",
    "this likely means that more active regions are distributed across their stellar surfaces and stronger magnetic - field strengths outside of these active regions are present in the group 2 stars compared with the group 1 stars . as a result , the coronal surface area not covered by active regions is decreased substantially such that there is much less available volume for open field lines to expand .",
    "the smaller divergence of field lines from active regions will not be able to compensate for the enhanced mass flux along these stronger magnetic - field lines .",
    "@xcite showed that in the absence of significant magnetic - field divergence , stellar mass - loss rates will increase with the magnetic field strength and the available energy at the base of the magnetic field lines .",
    "a viable explanation for the solar - like mass - loss rates for the rapidly rotating stars in group 3 is a matter of speculation at this time .",
    "we suggest that the very strong dynamos in these stars produce complex magnetic - field morphologies including a strong toroidal component seen in rapidly rotating stars like @xmath17  boo  a @xcite .",
    "these very strong magnetic fields are likely closed in very active stellar coronae leaving only a few open - field lines from which the stellar wind can emerge .",
    "the fewer open - field lines could more than compensate for the stronger mass - flux rates in the remaining open - field lines .",
    "simulations by @xcite of mhd wave propagation upwards along open magnetic field lines from the photospheres of solar - like stars may explain the empirical correlation of @xmath5 with @xmath12 shown in figure  4 .",
    "they found that with increasing magnetic field strength and turbulence in the photosphere ( the origin of stellar activity ) , the reflection of upwardly propagating alfvn waves is less efficient , leading to an increase in the energy available in the corona for mass loss and x - ray emission .",
    "however , radiative losses in the chromosphere increase even faster than the mass - loss flux , leading first to @xmath5 saturation at a high level and then to decreasing @xmath5 with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "qualitatively , this may explain the increase and then decrease of @xmath5 with increasing @xmath12 , but the peak @xmath5 corresponding to saturation in these calculations is much larger than is observed and the decrease in @xmath5 at very large @xmath12 levels was not modeled in detail .",
    "the study of cool dwarf star astrospheres has made important progress from the early theoretical models of the heliosphere that first showed the presence of a hydrogen wall @xcite , through the development of sophisticated - hydrodynamic models of stellar atmospheres by mller , izmodenov , zank , and others , to the testing and refinement of these models by comparison with stellar lyman-@xmath0 observations . despite this important progress ,",
    "there remain a number of critical problems requiring future theoretical and observational studies :    * charge - exchange rates * : :    the existence and physical properties of solar / stellar hydrogen walls    depend critically on charge - exchange reaction rates between outflowing    solar / stellar wind ions ( primarily protons ) and the inflowing lism    neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "if the presently assumed charge - exchange    reactions rates are in error , then the inferred values for n(h i ) ,    heating , and deceleration of neutral hydrogen atoms in the hydrogen    wall will also be in error .",
    "it is important to compute charge - exchange    reaction rates for the low densities and likely non - maxwellian    velocity distributions of the interacting species .",
    "* proper inclusion of neutrals * : :    neutral hydrogen and helium atoms inflowing from the lism have long    mean - free paths that are not easily included in hydrodynamic model    calculations .",
    "the neutrals must be treated with kinetic equations or    monte carlo simulations that must be coupled somehow to the    hydrodynamic calculations for the plasma .",
    "* theoretical models of stellar astrospheres may not include all physical processes * : :    for example , most models and simulations assume that stellar mass loss    is constant or quasi - steady state and , therefore , do not include    transient events like coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) that are seen on    the sun but not yet detected on stars .",
    "@xcite argued that cmes in    active stars could dominate the mass - loss rate based on an    extrapolation of solar data , but this process must be tested in    realistic models and against stellar cme measurements when they become    available .",
    "the magnetic field morphology , in particular the height at    which closed field lines open , plays an important role in mass loss .",
    "realistic models should compute the magnetic field structure    self - consistently with the mass outflow . *",
    "accurate boundary conditions * : :    whether the lism gas flowing into the heliosphere forms a bow shock or    a bow wave requires accurate values for the interstellar gas flow    speed and magnetic field strength . even for the sun ,",
    "for which we have    the best data , these quantities are not yet known accurately .",
    "in    particular , the magnetic field strength outside of the heliopause has    not yet been measured by the voyager spacecraft or reliably estimated .    for nearby stars ,",
    "the flow speed of the star with respect to the    interstellar medium gas is probably uncertain by less than 3    km  s@xmath9 , but the interstellar magnetic field is not    well known . thus the presence or absence of a bow shock is not known    in many cases . a critical question is whether the interstellar gas    flowing into an astrosphere is partially ionized like the lic or fully    ionized . in the latter case",
    ", there will be an astrosphere but no    hydrogen wall and thus no possibility for measuring the mass - loss    rate .",
    "the presence of lyman-@xmath0 absorption on the    short wavelength side of the interstellar absorption indicates the    presence of a hydrogen wall and that the star is surrounded by    partially ionized interstellar gas , but the inferred value of    @xmath5 depends on the neutral hydrogen number density    of the inflowing gas which has been assumed to be the same as in the    lic given the absence of other measurements .",
    "the nondetection of    astrospheric lyman-@xmath0 absorption can be explained    either by assuming that the star is embedded in fully - ionized    interstellar gas or that the star has an extremely low mass - loss rate .",
    "the latter is unlikely but can not be ruled out at this time . *",
    "active stars appear to have low mass - loss rates * : :    we have suggested that the low mass - loss rates for the two rapidly    rotating stars with @xmath23    ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath9 result from very    strong magnetic fields with complex geometries that severely restrict    the number of open field lines in the corona .",
    "a new generation of    theoretical models is needed to test and develop this scenario .",
    "there    are models for very rapidly rotating stars in which magnetocentrifugal    acceleration is important @xcite and for t tauri stars for which    accretion and disk winds are important ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "what is lacking    are models for stars like @xmath19 ori and    @xmath17  boo a , which are active stars without extreme    rotation or t tauri - like phenomena .",
    "numerical simulations of mhd wave    propagation in open flux tubes embedded in realistic atmospheres such    as those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite provide insight into the    essential physics and need to be developed further . observations of    more stars , especially those with @xmath12 near and above    @xmath24 erg  @xmath8  s@xmath9 , are    also needed to determine whether the decrease in @xmath5    for @xmath25    erg  @xmath8  s@xmath9 is sharp or gradual , or    indeed typical . also ,",
    "reobservations of stellar    lyman-@xmath0 lines 510 years after the original    observations would test whether astrospheres and mass - loss rates    change during the time scale for stellar winds to propagate well out    into their astrospheres .",
    "the study of astrospheres is intimately connected with the measurements of stellar - wind mass fluxes for late - type stars . at present",
    "the lyman-@xmath0 astrospheres technique is the only successful technique for infering these mass - loss rates .",
    "new theoretical models for stellar astrospheres and stellar mass loss are needed to explain in physical terms the results provided by this technique .",
