    "a major technological challenge today is the design of devices at the nanoscale that can efficiently and reliably convert energy between different forms . at such small scales ,",
    "the thermal and quantum fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities become especially significant , and the stochastic nature plays a dominant role in determining the performance of quantum devices @xcite .    more recently",
    ", major theoretical developments have also been made specifically towards the understanding and implementation of quantum thermodynamics .",
    "these include for instance , advances in fluctuations theorems @xcite , and on the use of external control protocols to produce adiabatic dynamics in finite time @xcite .    at the same time , properties of non - equilibrium work distributions have also been investigated experimentally in classical systems @xcite , culminating with the realization of a colloidal micro - scale stochastic heat engine@xcite , and quantum systems @xcite . due to the high degree of tunability and control , ultra - cold ion setups",
    "have also positioned themselves as promising candidates for experimental realizations of quantum heat engine cycles @xcite . in addition , a proposal for the realization of an otto cycle within a solid state set - up was recently studied @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has also been shown numerically , that the exchange symmetry of particles do play a significant role in the work distribution of quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "as such , here we address the pertinent issue of many - body statistics in quantum heat engines .",
    "in particular , we elucidate the role of exchange statistics in the performance of quantum cycles by providing an intuitive understanding of the interesting connection between exchange statistics and the geometry of the trapping potential .",
    "we consider a quantum equivalent of the otto - cycle @xcite in which the working fluid is a quantum gas of @xmath0 indistinguishable and non - interacting particles .",
    "the collective system undergoes a cyclic sequence of adiabatic and iso - parametric processes , where the heat received by external reservoirs can be in part , converted into useful work , while the rest is transferred to a cold reservoir .",
    "important characteristics and figures of merit of the engine cycle s performances are the probability distributions of both its net work output and its efficiency . in this work",
    "we study how the statistics , either bosonic or fermionic , of the gas particles affects the engine s performance .",
    "we show that this is strongly dependent on the single particle energy level structure of the system and indicate strategies to improve the performance of the engine cycle by a careful choice of both the trapping potential and the type of gas .",
    "it is only when considered in conjunction , that trap geometry @xcite and particle exchange statistics @xcite can be utilized to optimize the performance of quantum heat engines .    .",
    "the dark blue ( light red ) squares represent the occupation of energy levels at 0 temperature for the case of @xmath1 bosonic ( fermionic ) atoms .",
    "( a ) triangular potential ( @xmath2 ) , ( b ) infinite square well potential ( @xmath3 ) and ( c ) double well potential .",
    "the horizontal thin grey lines indicate the position of the @xmath4-th single particle energy level .",
    "( d ) schematics of a quantum otto cycle in an average energy @xmath5 vs trapping parameter @xmath6 . ]",
    "we consider non - interacting particles in different trapping potentials : with the energy level spacings either constant ( harmonic potential ) , monotonically decreasing ( triangular potential , see fig.[fig:1](a ) ) , increasing ( square potential , see fig.[fig:1](b ) ) or change non - monotonically ( double well , see fig.[fig:1](c ) ) .",
    "to gain some preliminary intuitive insights to the problem , in fig.[fig:1 ] we show how @xmath1 atoms are distributed in the respective potentials at temperature @xmath7 depending on the given symmetry .",
    "we note that the energy difference between the ground state and the first excited state can be very different depending on whether the gas is bosonic or fermionic in nature and on whether the gap between energy levels is increasing ( e.g. square well ) or decreasing ( e.g. triangular potential ) . in fig.[fig:1](a ) we observe that for bosons ( blue squares ) the gap is larger than for that of the fermions ( red circles ) ; whereas in the case of a potential in which the energy level distance is monotonically increasing ( square well in fig.[fig:1](b ) , the gap will be larger for the fermions and smaller for that of the bosons . for a potential in which the distances between energy levels do not feature a monotonous behavior ( double well in fig.[fig:1](c ) ) , the excitation gap not only depends on the particle statistics , but also on the number of atoms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] , we provide general relations and results for quantum otto cycles with scaling potentials ; in section [ sec:3 ] , we show our main results and lastly , in section [ sec:4 ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "in classical thermodynamics , the otto cycle is composed of two processes in which only heat is exchanged with the environment , and two processes in which only work is exchanged ( and no heat is transferred ) .",
    "the former is usually referred to as an isochoric process for a classical ideal gas .",
    "analogously , a quantum otto cycle is composed of two quantum adiabatic processes , represented in fig.[fig:1](d ) by the steps @xmath8\\rightarrow [ b]$ ] and @xmath9\\rightarrow [ d]$ ] , as well as two iso - parametric processes , represented in fig.[fig:1](d ) by the steps @xmath10\\rightarrow [ c]$ ] and @xmath11\\rightarrow [ a]$ ] , in which the hamiltonian of the system is kept constant and the environment is ( weakly ) coupled to the system @xcite . similar to their classical counterparts , no heat is exchanged with the working fluid in quantum adiabatic processes , while only heat is exchanged in an iso - parametric process .",
    "@xmath12}$ ] corresponds to the lowest temperature in the cycle while @xmath13}$ ] is the largest .",
    "as we are interested in the governing principles of quantum thermodynamic cycles involving non - interacting many - body quantum gases , we will only study quasi - static cycles , leaving the cycles with finite power for a future study .    to gain deeper analytical insights",
    ", we also focus on hamiltonians with scaling properties @xcite , or more generally on driving protocols in which the energy level structure after a unitary process is simply multiplied by a scale - factor .",
    "the harmonic oscillator is the prototypical example of such scaling hamiltonians , as the energy levels are simply proportional to the trapping frequency .    in a more general sense , for every potential of the form @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is a control parameter with units of length and @xmath16 is the position coordinate of the @xmath17-th atom ) , the hamiltonian @xmath18 has a scaling energy spectrum .",
    "in fact @xmath19\\nonumber\\\\   & = \\frac 1 { \\lambda^2 }",
    "\\sum_i \\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x_i^2 } + f\\left ( x_i \\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a dimensionless variable @xcite .",
    "this applies to all power - law potentials of the form @xmath21 since @xmath22 where @xmath23^{\\frac{1}{a+2}}$ ] is the energy scale @xcite .",
    "it is thus now clear that that the energy levels are simply scaled by the prefactor @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , the ratio of the energy of the @xmath4-th level for hamiltonian parameter @xmath25 ( i.e. @xmath26 ) divided by that for parameter @xmath6 ( i.e. @xmath27 ) does not depend on @xmath4 and it is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a parameter that only depends on @xmath6 and @xmath30 . in the following we will use the lighter notation @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , a more general polynomial like the double - well potential may also be made to possess a scaling property in its energy levels , albeit in the presence of certain restrictions .",
    "for example , the double well potential @xmath33 has a scaling hamiltonian @xmath34 so long as the anharmonic parameter @xmath35 remains fixed throughout the hamiltonian evolution .",
    "let us consider a process from hamiltonian parameter @xmath6 to @xmath25 .",
    "the respective single particle @xmath4-th energy eigenvalues will be @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath39 represent the number of particles in the @xmath4-th single energy eigenstate .",
    "a single @xmath40body state is thus given by the ordered set of occupation numbers @xmath41 .",
    "a process is performed quasi - statically by changing the trap parameter adiabatically , and the corresponding @xmath40body microstate at the end of the compression is then given by @xmath42 .",
    "for a single realization of the protocol @xmath43 the work is given by a two - times energy measurement @xcite @xmath44 the energy @xmath45 ( resp .",
    "@xmath46 ) is given by the sum over the energy @xmath47 ( resp .",
    "@xmath48 ) of the @xmath49-th single particle eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( e.g. @xmath50 ) .",
    "hence , the ensemble average of work done for the process between two trap parameters is given by : @xmath51 where the kronecker delta @xmath52 is due to the adiabaticity of the process .",
    "the average @xmath53 is computed over the intial probability distribution @xmath54 which , at this stage , can be general .",
    "because of the scaling property of the hamiltonians we consider , the ratio of initial to final energy of each single particle eigenstate @xmath55 ( see eq.([eq : nu ] ) and @xcite ) .",
    "this results in the work of an adiabatic process to be @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the energy of the system at the beginning of the process .",
    "the standard deviation of the work probability distribution function of a process @xmath43 , @xmath59 , is also important to characterize a process as it quantifies the consistency and reliability of the output . for an adiabatic unitary process in a scaling potential",
    "we have @xmath60 it follows that the scaled standard deviation of work , defined as the standard deviation of the work distribution divided by its mean work is given by @xmath61 which is independent of @xmath29 , i.e. independent of whether ( i ) the process is a compression or an expansion , and ( ii ) the extent of the process ( provided it is quantum adiabatic ) .",
    "the ensemble moments of the cyclic work distribution is derived from the work distribution of the constitutive single adibatic processes .",
    "the cycle work distribution is composed of two statistically independent work distributions on the compression and expansion arms of the cycle because of the nature of the ideal quantum otto cycle .",
    "the combined work distribution is thus given by the product distribution of two statistically independent processes @xmath62p(w_c)p(w_e)\\ ] ] where @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is the work in the compression ( expansion ) process .",
    "for the cycle depicted in fig.[fig:1](d ) between parameters @xmath6 and @xmath30 the net work output is given by @xmath65 } \\rangle_{\\alpha } + \\left(\\frac 1 \\nu -1\\right ) \\langle e_{[c ] } \\rangle_{\\alpha } \\label{eq : network}\\ ] ] where here again , @xmath66 and @xmath67 } \\rangle_{\\alpha}$ ] is the average energy at the vertex @xmath68}$ ] of the cycle and @xmath69 means average over the thermal canonical state for fermions ( @xmath70 ) or bosons ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "consequentially , the mean and variance of the cycle are also just the linear sum of the mean and variance of the individual processes .",
    "the scaled work fluctuations are thus given by @xmath72 in addition , we also note that if the adiabatic processes of an otto cycle are peformed within scaling potentials then the efficiency is a non - stochastic function of @xmath29 @xcite independent of the quantum statistics of the working fluid .",

    "the average work output and its standard deviation can thus be computed from eq.([eq : aw ] ) and ( [ eq : sd ] ) .",

    "the area enclosed in the fermionic cycle is much smaller .",

    "a similar scenario , although in the opposite direction , emerges for a triangular potential as depicted in fig.[fig : fig3](c ) . in this case",

    "the entropy is lower for the species experiencing the largest gap ( bosons in this case ) .    to gain deeper understanding we revert to figs.[fig : fig4]-[fig : fig5](a - b )",

    "if @xmath12}$ ] was too high , the difference between the fermionic and bosonic statistics will be much reduced .    in this case",
    "it plays particular importance the fact that at cold temperatures the work done in the cold arm is , in modulus , larger for the fermions than for the bosons .",
    "hence , while the difference in work becomes negligible in one process , in the other process there is more work exchange for the fermions .",
    "the combination of these two effects results in a net work which is lower for the fermions .",
    "here , we derive eq.([eq : bosferpart ] ) following the argument as presented in @xcite .",
    "to do so we start from the grand canonical partition function @xmath141 , where @xmath142 or @xmath143 , is the subscript that denotes bosonic and fermionic statistics respectively .",
    "the grand partition function can be written as @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the canonical partition function for @xmath0 atoms . in equation ( [ eq : grandcano ] )",
    "@xmath146 is commonly known as the fugacity , where @xmath147 is the chemical potential associated to the ensemble .",
    "it is also possible to write the logarithm of @xmath141 as @xmath148 where @xmath149 in general , assumes different functional forms depending on the given type of particle statistics considered . by exponentiating ( [ eq : loggrandcano ] ) and using the fa di bruno s formula , which states that the power series expansion of the exponential of a polynomial @xmath150 is @xmath151 we can derive @xmath152 where @xmath153 is a bell polynomial .",
    "next , by equating corresponding terms of the polynomial expansion in ( [ eq : polycano ] ) and ( [ eq : grandcano ] ) , we get @xmath154 note that up to this point in the derivation , we have not made any distinction between bosonic or fermionic statistics .",
    "the grand partition function for the fermions can be written as a formal power series @xmath155 where we have used the expansion of @xmath156 and where @xmath157 is the single particle canonical partition function with inverse temperature @xmath158 ( of course @xmath159 ) .",
    "finally , using equations ( [ eq : kappacano ] ) and ( [ eq : kappafer ] ) together with the identity for bell polynomials : @xmath160 we derive eq.([eq : bosferpart ] ) for fermions .",
    "similarly for bosons @xmath161 and again using eq.([eq : kappacano ] ) , ( [ eq : bell ] ) and ( [ eq : kappabos ] ) yields eq.([eq : bosferpart ] ) for bosons .",
    "for the simple harmonic oscillator , the hamiltonian parameter @xmath162 .",
    "hence the energy of the system will scale with @xmath163 .",
    "following the derivation of @xcite , we begin by writing the grand canonical partition function for bosons in terms of a q - shifted factorial : @xmath164 here , @xmath165 , @xmath166 where @xmath146 is as before , the fugacity , and @xmath167 is a q - shifted factorial . by using the @xmath168-analog binomial theorem : @xmath169 where the @xmath168-shifted factorial reduces to simply : @xmath170 notice that we can also write @xmath171 as a formal power series involving the canonical partition function @xmath83 @xmath172 and thus by comparison of the two equivalent series , we are able to write down the canonical partition function for the bosons : @xmath101 similarly for the fermions , @xmath173 and using the identity @xmath174 we can write @xmath102"
