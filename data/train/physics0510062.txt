    "fluctuations of prices in financial markets , wind speed data or daily precipitations in a given place for the same time windows are typically described by time series @xmath0 made by uncorrelated records @xcite . in these cases , by considering the return intervals @xmath1 of extreme events associated with the overcoming of a given threshold @xmath2 ( i.e. the time intervals between two consecutive occurences of the condition @xmath3 ) , it can be seen that the @xmath1 are exponentially distributed @xcite . in other terms , the probability density function ( pdf ) of the distribution of the @xmath1 is given by @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mean return interval . of course , the higher the threshold @xmath2 , the bigger is the value of @xmath5 . on the other hand , in the last years",
    "it has become clear that several other important examples of time series display long - term correlations @xcite .",
    "this is the case of physiological data ( heartbeats @xcite and neuron spikes @xcite ) , hydro - meteorological records ( daily temperatures @xcite ) , geophysical or astrophysical data ( occurrence of earthquakes @xcite or solar flares @xcite ) , internet traffic @xcite and stock market volatility @xcite records . long - term correlated series are characterized by an auto - correlation function , @xmath6 , decaying as a power - law : @xmath7 with exponent @xmath8 ( correlation exponent ) between 0 and 1 . in this case , the mean correlation time @xmath9 , given by the integral over @xmath10 of @xmath6 , diverges .",
    "the effect of long - terms correlations on the statistics of the @xmath1 has been first studied by bunde et al . @xcite and",
    "the conclusions of this study were the following .",
    "i ) the mean return interval @xmath5 is left unchanged by the presence of long - terms correlations .",
    "ii ) the distribution of return intervals becomes a stretched exponential : @xmath11   \\label{stretch}\\ ] ] where the two exponents @xmath12 and @xmath8 were found to be equal .",
    "iii ) the return intervals themself are long - term correlated with a correlation exponent @xmath13 . as noted by altmann and kantz in a very recent paper @xcite , the result i ) , obtained by bunde et al .",
    "@xcite by statistical arguments , can be identified with kac s lemma @xcite introduced in the context of dynamical systems .",
    "the results ii ) and iii ) were obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite on the ground of numerical calculations performed on long - term correlated and gaussian time series generated by the algorithm described in ref .",
    "it must be noted that the result ii ) only applies to linear time series ( i.e. to series whose properties are completely defined by the power spectrum and by the probability distribution , regardless of the fourier phases ) @xcite .",
    "apart from this restriction , the stretched exponential distribution of the @xmath1 seems to be a general feature in presence of long - term correlations in a time series @xcite .",
    "it must be underlined that this fact has important consequences on the observation of extreme events : indeed it implies a strong enhancement of the probability of having return intervals well below and well above @xmath5 , in comparison with the occurrence of extreme events in an uncorrelated time series .",
    "furthermore , it must be noted that the stretched exponential distribution depends on the parameter @xmath12 only , being @xmath14 and @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ stretch ] ) functions of @xmath12 , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper it will be analyzed the effect on the distribution of the @xmath1 of the presence of finite - term correlations with non - exponential decay , a situation which can occur in systems which are approaching criticality , where intermediate behaviors , consisting in a non - exponential and non - power - law decay of correlations can emerge @xcite .",
    "precisely , in the following section it will be studied the statistics of the return intervals of extreme values of the resistance fluctuations displayed by a resistor with granular structure in a nonequilibrium stationary state @xcite .",
    "the time series analyzed in this paper consist in the resistance fluctuations of a thin resistor with granular structure , in contact with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath16 and biased by an external current @xmath17 .",
    "the resistance values are calculated by using the stationary and biased resistor network ( sbrn ) model @xcite .",
    "this model describes a thin film with granular structure as a two - dimensional resistor network in a stationary state determined by the competition between two stochastic processes , breaking and recovery of the elementary resistors . a broken elementary resistor ( with resistance 10@xmath18 higher than the resistance corresponding to a normal elementary resistor )",
    "can be associated with a high resistivity region within the conducting material .",
    "both processes are thermally activated and biased by the external current .",
    "the resistance of the network and its fluctuations are calculated by monte carlo simulations @xcite . within this model ,",
    "the level of intrinsic disorder in the network ( average fraction of broken resistors in the vanishing current limit @xcite ) is controlled by a characteristic parameter @xcite : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the activation energies respectively of the breaking and recovery processes .",
    "the intrinsic disorder parameter @xmath22 ranges between : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 corresponds to an homogeneous resistor ( perfect network ) and @xmath25 to the maximum level of intrinsic disorder compatible with a stationary state of the network ( stationary resistance fluctuations ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to this intrinsic disorder , the sbrn model considers also the presence of a disorder driven by the external current @xmath17 . as a consequence , for a given value of @xmath22 , and for a network of given size ,",
    "nonequilibrium stationary states of the network exist only when @xmath26 ( breakdown threshold ) .",
    "for contrast , when @xmath27 the network undergoes an electrical breakdown associated with an irreversible divergence of its resistance @xcite .",
    "for an arbitrary value of @xmath22 this breakdown corresponds to a first order transition from a conducting to a non - conducting state of the network @xcite .",
    "however , at decreasing @xmath22 values , when @xmath28 , the system becomes more and more close to its critical point @xcite .",
    "all the details about the sbrn model and its results can be found in refs .",
    "however , it must be noted that this model provides a good description of many features associated with nonequilibrium stationary states and with the electrical instability of composites and granular materials @xcite , including the electromigration damage of metallic lines @xcite .",
    "finally , it must be underlined that , apart from the specific system described by the sbrn model , the method adopted here for generating the time series can be also viewed as a pure numerical algorithm for generating numerical series with different and tunable correlation properties .",
    "[ fig:1 ]    -10.1truecm8.0truecm    [ fig:2 ]    then , by indicating with @xmath29 the resistance of the network ( expressed in @xmath30 ) and with @xmath31 the time ( expressed in iteration steps ) , long @xmath32 time series ( typically made of @xmath33 records ) have been generated and analyzed for different values of @xmath22 , of the external current and of the network size .",
    "precisely , normalized series with zero average and unit variance have been considered : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the average value of the network resistance and @xmath36 the root - mean - square deviation from the average .",
    "the analysis has been performed by calculating the auto - correlation function and the pdf of the @xmath37 records , the return intervals @xmath1 of the extreme values for different threshold @xmath2 and their distribution @xmath38 ( the values of @xmath2 are expressed in units of @xmath36 ) . for small @xmath22 values ( high level of intrinsic disorder ) , it has been found that @xmath39 displays a non - exponential and non - power - law decay .",
    "this behavior is different from that obtained for high @xmath22 values ( low level of intrinsic disorder ) , where @xmath39 decays exponentially ( consistently with the lorentzian power spectrum reported in refs .",
    "@xcite ) . by focusing on this situation , of interest for systems which are approaching criticality , in the following of this section results will be shown concerning a network of size @xmath40 , biased by a current @xmath41 a and obtained by taking @xmath42 .",
    "0.5truecm    [ fig:3 ]    -9.0truecm8.0truecm    [ fig:4 ]    the @xmath0 time series is shown in fig",
    ". 1 ( only a small portion of the total number of records , @xmath43 , is reported in this figure ) . as evident from fig .",
    "1 , the resistance fluctuations exhibit a strong non - gaussianity and actually their pdf is well described by the bramwell - holdworth - pinton distribution @xcite , as discussed in refs .",
    "the auto - correlation function of @xmath0 is reported in fig .",
    "the function significantly deviates from a single exponential and from a power - law while it is well fitted by a stretched exponential : @xmath44   \\label{stretch_cx}\\ ] ] with the following values of the fitting parameters : @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "many other functions have also been considered for the best - fit of the @xmath39 data .",
    "however , it has been found that the stretched exponential optimizes the best - fit procedure with the minimum numbers of fitting parameters .",
    "it must be remarked that a stretched exponential describes a behavior intermediate between a simple exponential decay ( which is obtained for @xmath48 ) and a constant behavior ( a limit of power - law ) for @xmath49 . moreover",
    ", the correlation time corresponding to the expression ( [ stretch_cx ] ) of @xmath39 is finite .",
    "the sequence of the @xmath50 return intervals of the values above the threshold @xmath51 is plotted in fig .",
    "3 as a sequence of @xmath50 impulses .",
    "the figure shows that a succession of very short return intervals ( @xmath52 , the apparently empty portions of the horizontal axis ) is followed by a succession of long intervals , indicating a strong clustering of the extreme events , a feature similar to that exhibited by the data of bunde et al .",
    "@xcite which instead concern long - term correlated records and very different from what observed for uncorrelated time series @xcite",
    ". thus , the clustering of the extreme events is present even if the @xmath37 records are not long - term correlated while they are characterized by a finite correlation time .",
    "this clustering of the extreme values persists also by lowering the threshold .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "4 which reports the sequence of the return intervals obtained for @xmath53 .",
    "0.3truecm    [ fig:5 ]    -8.7truecm8.0truecm    [ fig:6 ]    0.8truecm    figure 5 displays the probability density function @xmath38 of the distribution of the return intervals as a function of @xmath54 for different thresholds @xmath2 ranging from @xmath55 to @xmath56 ( the probability density has been normalized to @xmath57 .",
    "a double - logarithmic plot of @xmath58 has been adopted because in this representation a stretched exponential function with exponent @xmath12 appears as a straight line of slope @xmath12 .",
    "therefore fig .",
    "5 shows that the distribution of the return intervals of extreme values of the x - series is well described by a stretched exponential and that the value of the exponent @xmath12 is independent of the threshold @xmath2 in a large range of @xmath2-values .",
    "this occurs even in absence of long - term corrrelations and in presence of a finite correlation time .",
    "this not - obvious result agrees with the conclusions of altmann and kantz formulated in their recent paper @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "6 reports the probability density function @xmath38 of the distribution of the return intervals obtained after random shuffling the records of the same x - series : in this case @xmath48 , i.e. the distribution of the @xmath1 is exponential , as it must be for uncorrelated time series .",
    "the distribution of return intervals of extreme events has been studied in time series with finite - term correlations .",
    "precisely , it has been analyzed the distribution of return intervals of extreme values of the resistance fluctuations displayed by a resistor with granular structure in nonequilibrium stationary states .",
    "the resistance fluctuations were calculated by using the sbrn model based on a resistor network approach @xcite .",
    "it has been found that for highly disordered networks , when the auto - correlation function displays a non - exponential and a non - power - law decay , the distribution of the @xmath1 is well described by a stretched exponential with exponent @xmath12 largely independent of the threshold @xmath2 .",
    "this result shows that the stretched exponential distribution describes the distribution of the return intervals of extreme events not only when long - term correlations are present in the time series @xcite , but also when finite - term correlations exist among the records , characterized by a non - exponential decay , a situation typical of systems which are approaching criticality .    partial support from spot nosed project ist-2001 - 38899 of e.c . and from miur cofin-03 project `` modelli e misure in nanostrutture ''",
