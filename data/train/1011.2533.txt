    "langevin models have become increasingly important in modeling systems subject to fluctuations .",
    "these models have a wide range of applications in physics , chemistry , electronics , biology , and financial market analysis . in many applications ,",
    "fluctuations are modeled in terms of white noise , which has a delta function correlation with constant noise intensity . in general , fluctuations are space - time dependent phenomena ; hence , the noise intensity fluctuates temporally and/or spatially .",
    "nevertheless , white noise has been be used to model fluctuations because at the typical level of physical description , variations in noise intensity can be ignored .",
    "however , if the variation in the noise intensity fluctuations is large and if it occurs in time scales comparable to the physical description of interest , the effects of such fluctuations have to be taken into account .",
    "noise intensity fluctuations due to environmental variations are particularly important in biological applications .",
    "for instance , the stochasticity of a gene expression mechanism is derived from intrinsic ( discreteness of particle number ) and extrinsic ( noise sources external to the system ) fluctuations . because extrinsic fluctuations are subject to biological rhythms with different time scales @xcite , their noise intensity varies temporally .    in financial market analysis ,",
    "stochastic volatility models ( e.g. , the hull & white model and heston model ) incorporate temporal noise intensity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the stochastic volatility models assume that noise variance is governed by stochastic processes . in physics , superstatistics @xcite take spatial and/or temporal environmental fluctuations into account .",
    "superstatistics has been applied to stochastic processes , and it has introduced noise intensity fluctuations @xcite , by calculating stationary distributions in a bayesian manner . a previous study @xcite indicates the similarity between distributions of a stochastic volatility model and tsallis statistics , which has the same stationary distribution ( @xmath0-gaussian distribution ) as superstatistics in specific cases .",
    "most discussions on stochastic volatility models are limited to linear drift terms ; hence , the application of such models to physical , chemical , or biological systems , accompanied by nontrivial drift terms and multiplicative noise , is nontrivial . in our previous paper @xcite , we proposed an approximation scheme that can be applied to general drift terms .",
    "we considered langevin equations where the white gaussian noise intensity is governed by the ornstein  uhlenbeck process : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a drift term ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a potential ) , @xmath5 is the relaxation rate , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 denote white gaussian noise with the correlation [ @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the present paper ,",
    "we call the term @xmath10 the stochastic intensity noise ( sin ) because the noise intensity is governed by a stochastic process . in ref",
    ".  @xcite , we obtained a time evolution equation using adiabatic elimination with an eigenfunction expansion @xcite .",
    "although the previously developed method @xcite can be applied to nonlinear drift terms , its application is limited to @xmath11 [ @xmath5 is the relaxation rate in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sin_langevin ] ) ] . at the same time",
    ", we showed that the time evolution equation of @xmath12 is a higher order fokker ",
    "planck equation ( fpe ) having derivatives of orders higher than two @xcite .",
    "analytic calculations of dynamical quantities such as mean - first passage time ( mfpt ) and stochastic resonance ( sr ) are mainly developed for one - variable fpes ; hence , their use in higher - order fpes is nontrivial .",
    "accordingly , in this paper , we investigate the dynamical properties of the coupled equations ( [ eq : main_langevin ] ) and ( [ eq : sin_langevin ] ) , expanding functions of interest ( stationary distributions and eigenfunctions ) in terms of an orthonormal complete set .",
    "this technique is extensively used to solve fpes numerically ( e.g. , the matrix continued fraction method . for details , please see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "complete set expansion ( cse ) can be applied to polynomial drift terms , and it can , in principle , solve for the entire range of @xmath5 ; on the other hand , the adiabatic elimination based method is limited to @xmath11 @xcite .    in the present paper , we investigate mfpt and sr with a bistable potential [ see eq .  ( [ eq : quartic_bistable ] ) ] . as stated above",
    ", sin is particularly important in biological mechanisms . in a zeroth - order approximation , many important biological mechanisms , such as neuron and gene expression , can be modeled with a bistable potential .",
    "mfpt and sr have also been extensively investigated in such biological mechanisms . in the calculation of mfpt",
    ", we show that mfpt , as a function of @xmath5 , has a minimum around @xmath13 , which is equivalent to resonant activation ( ra ) @xcite . furthermore , by changing @xmath14 ( the squared variation coefficient of noise intensity fluctuations [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_def ] ) ] ) , mfpt also has a minimum around @xmath15 . in the calculation of sr , we show that the sr effect is smaller for smaller @xmath5 , which indicates that the sr effect is maximized under white noise .",
    "in addition , the spectral amplification factor , as a function of @xmath14 , has a minimum around @xmath15 .",
    "these results show that the strength of ra and sr effects can not be maximized simultaneously .",
