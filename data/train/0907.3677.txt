    "combining the new scuba results with earlier millimetre surveys for debris around fgk dwarfs @xcite , in total 33 sun - like stars @xmath45  myr old have now been observed , spanning the epoch after terrestrial planet formation ( e.g. the latest age of earth completion , @xcite ) up to the end of the main - sequence .",

    "the far - infrared to millimetre fluxes have been fitted successfully with grain temperatures ranging from 50 to 100  k , so there is no indication of additional debris in very cold and distant comet belts for these stars .",
    "thus although there are some systems with evidence of dust below 40  k ( * ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , this appears to be uncommon around solar analogues .",
    "most millimetre detections have been made towards young stars . dividing the 33 objects into two broad age bins of width 1 dex around 500  myr and 5  gyr ( to reduce the effects of uncertain dating )",
    ", there are up to 6 debris detections ( 2 tentative ) out of 13 stars in the younger group , compared to only 1/20 in the older set . with poisson counting errors , the detection rate then nominally declines from ( 30 - 45 )  @xmath46  ( 15 - 20 )  % to @xmath47  % for stars an order of magnitude older .",
    "however , the counts are skewed because some projects targeted more young stars and/or prior debris - candidates . hence , the true incidences are likely to be lower , and the trend with time may be partly forced by deeper searches towards targets thought more likely to yield detections .",
    "for example , four of the seven young prior - debris candidates have possible millimetre detections , but these were also some of the deepest observations made in the respective surveys @xcite . in general , a decline of dustiness with age is plausible , especially as the fraction of prior debris candidates ( @xmath48  % ) happens to be the same in both the young and old samples , reducing one source of bias . also , the oldest millimetre detection is hd  48682 at only @xmath49  gyr , suggesting that stars several gyr old may tend to be millimetre - faint .",

    "e.g. @xcite noted that bright ( iras - detected ) debris is marginally more common among g - dwarfs under 1  gyr old compared to older stars .",
    "to re - assess this hypothesis , we looked at far - infrared surveys of sun - like stars and compiled literature results into the same broad age bins around 500 myr and 5 gyr ( figure  4 ) .",
    "earlier observations with iso of stars in the 500  myr - old uma moving group @xcite were added to improve the statistics in the young bin ; there are three far - infrared debris detections ( for hd  125451 , 139798 , 184960 ) among fourteen additional sun - like stars observed .",
    "figure  4 confirms that dust luminosity derived from far - infrared excess is on average somewhat higher in the younger group .",
    "the millimetre - systems also appear to be representative of this luminous young group , with the four robust detections with good dust temperature estimates yielding @xmath52 from the millimetre fluxes .      in general the sun - like stars observed in millimetre surveys",
    "do not show cold dust , nor are there debris detections later than about 3  gyr .",
    "this suggests that large late - evolving comet belts are uncommon , such as those that could be stirred by formation of distant dwarf planets at several - gyr ages @xcite .",
    "while there are examples of both very large discs @xcite and very old debris hosts @xcite , neither appears to be the norm among sun - like stars observed at millimetre wavelengths .    to determine typical disc properties , we compare recent ( semi-)analytical models that predict the evolution of debris with time under various scenarios @xcite ; see @xcite for a summary .    * in _ steady state _",
    "evolution , the fractional luminosity of debris declines slowly as the parent population of planetesimals is ground to dust that is blown out of the system .",
    "the dust is brightest early on and then fades after a time that is shortest in compact and/or massive discs , because of the greater planetesimal collision rates .",
    "examples of models that fit the present data well ( * ? ? ?",
    "5 ) are discs of 30  au radius with initial masses up to 1  m@xmath1 in colliding bodies .",
    "if the majority are lower - mass systems ( e.g. 0.1  m@xmath1 ) then these are never detected as @xmath53 is always below @xmath54 , while the highest - mass discs have @xmath53 of a few @xmath54 at around 500  myr but declining to @xmath55 after around 3  gyr .",
    "these trends match most features of the data , including greater dust luminosity in the sub - gyr stars .",
    "* in contrast , in models where the planetesimals are _ stirred _ by gradually - forming larger bodies ( from 1000  km sizes up to giant planets ) , debris can brighten from an early low state and then fade at a similar rate to steady - state models .",
    "these systems tend to be more luminous than we observe unless the initial disc mass is much less than in the minimum mass solar nebula ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  5 ) .",
    "for millimetre and far - infrared debris detections to be made mainly for younger stars , discs should generally be compact , e.g. 70  au in radius ( * ? ? ?",
    "16 ) , as larger discs will stay bright beyond 1  gyr .",
    "* finally , in discs stirred by _",
    "migration _ of giant planets , there can be an abrupt dust shower as these bodies cross an orbital resonance with the comet belt , and very little debris later as the belt is depleted .",
    "@xcite find that the migration of jupiter and saturn could have stirred the kuiper belt thus causing the late heavy bombardment of the earth at around 0.7  gyr , while @xcite simulate this for different planetary system architectures and find equivalent events before @xmath56  gyr .",
    "however , this is unlikely to be a general phenomenon as debris would not be seen at all at few - gyr ages when the comet belts would be severely depleted .",
    "further , the 70  @xmath0 m excess is predicted to increase only slightly during such events and the dusty episode would last @xmath57  myr ( booth et al . ,",
    "submitted ) .",
    "thus at most a few per cent of stars in the @xmath58  myr bin should be undergoing heavy bombardment episodes when observed , and even fewer if only up to @xmath59  % of sun - like stars host giant planets @xcite .",
    "in general , the low debris incidence at all ages and the mild decline in luminosity at a few gyr require initial planetesimal discs of low mass , and of radius similar to the @xmath60  au of the solar system .",
    "the stirred models have a distinctive brightening at early times ( @xmath61  yr ) that the steady state models do not , and the somewhat raised incidence of 70  @xmath0 m excesses among feps stars at @xmath62 years ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath63",
    "% ) could favour this class of interpretations .",
    "bright debris systems undergoing resonance crossing in planetary migration are likely to be too few to be observed as a distinct subset among current surveys",
    ".    resolved debris discs of sun - like stars @xcite are probably unusually large if most systems possess solar system - sized comet belts . for five precise ( g2 v ) solar analogues the fitted disc radii are @xmath64  au @xcite ,",
    "also suggesting that the larger , more luminous , discs currently dominate the detected population . to place the sun s compact , low - dust , kuiper belt more accurately within the context of extrasolar debris systems",
    "requires deeper observations , and the results here are preliminary given the small sample size .",
    "the scuba survey was the first unbiased exploration of g - dwarfs in the submillimetre , and the upcoming scuba-2 survey @xcite will observe 100 g - dwarfs ( as well as equal numbers of a , f , k and m stars ) , and address the models and evolutionary timescales in more detail .",
    "this small unbiased survey for debris around solar analogues suggests that cold bright dust - belts are rare , especially for stars of typical few - gyr ages .",
    "the majority of stars should begin with insubstantial comet belts of dimensions similar to the sun s kuiper belt , with moderate dust luminosity only for about the first gyr of main - sequence lifetime .",
    "if these systems fade slowly with time as predicted in models , counterparts of sun - like age should be detectable in the far - infrared to submillimetre with near - future scuba-2 and herschel observations .",
