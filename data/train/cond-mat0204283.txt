    "similar phenomena are observed also in the aperiodic kronig - penney model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above models , the system of the random - mass dirac fermions belongs to the universality class of the _ chiral _ orthogonal ensemble and therefore the extended states exist at the band center though the others are localized for the white - noise random mass .",

    "we shall consider two types of the telegraphic random mass , i.e. , in the first one magnitudes of the random mass are long - range correlated random variables ( lrcrv ) with fixed interval distances between kinks whereas in the second one interval distances between kinks are lrcrv with a fixed random mass magnitude . in the present study",
