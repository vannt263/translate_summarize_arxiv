    "this is our second paper reporting abundance measurements for red giants in open clusters ( ocs ) lacking detailed information on their chemical composition . in our first paper ( reddy et al .",
    "2012 , hereafter paper i ) we have presented abundance measurements for four open clusters ( ocs ) whose galactocentric distances ( r@xmath0 ) lie between 8.3 and 10.5 kpc , where the sun s galactocentric distance is taken as 8.0@xmath1 kpc ( ghez et al .",
    "2008 ) . here , we add seven ocs six of which have not previously analysed in detail also in the galactic anticentre direction in the disc .",
    "our overall goal is to improve understanding of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "the abundance variation of chemical elements with galactocentric distance ( r@xmath2 ) ( i.e. , the radial metallicity gradient ) along ( and across ) the disc and the gradient s temporal variation over the disc s lifetime put constraints on galactic chemical evolution models which are controlled , in large part , by variations of such quantities as the initial mass function ( imf ) , the star formation rate ( sfr ) , gas flows in and out of the disc as well as through the disc .",
    "particularly informative diagnostics are the spatial and temporal variations of relative abundances which are traditionally referenced to the iron abundance , i.e. , ratios such as o / fe which primarily samples the relative rates of type ii and type ia supernovae and ba / fe where ba measures heavy element synthesis by agb stars .    abundance variations across the galaxy , particularly measurements of the radial gradient , have been measured using a wide variety of objects including hii regions , hot young stars , cepheid variables , planetary nebulae , red giants , and ocs .",
    "various disagreements and inconsistencies remain - see , for example , magrini et al .",
    "ocs either through spectroscopy of their red giants or cooler main sequence stars provide not only abundance estimates for many elements  essentially , elements sampling all the major processes of stellar nucleosynthesis  but a collection of stars with a well determined age , distance and metallicity .",
    "moreover , it is possible to estimate from an oc s space motion and a model of the galactic gravitational potential the birthplace of the oc .",
    "ocs dissolve over time thanks to tidal forces and feed stars into the field .",
    "intracluster abundance variations , especially in the @xmath3- and the heavy elements provide , in principle , a way to chemically tag groups of field stars to their parent cluster ( freeman & bland - hawthorn , 2002 ; de silva et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "such studies benefit from the largest possible sample of ocs with all properties analysed homogeneously with high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "addressing abundance variations across the galactic disk and applying chemical tagging requires homogeneous and accurate abundance analyses of as large a sample of ocs as possible . in this paper",
    ", we continue our modest efforts in this regard by extending our homogeneous abundance analysis for a sample of seven ocs for many elements including the s- and r - process elements for which the measurements are often lacking in the literature .",
    "the layout of the present paper is as follows : in section 2 we describe the data selection , observations and data reduction , and section 3 is devoted to the abundance analysis . in section 4",
    "we present our results and compare them with the abundances derived from samples of field giants .",
    "finally , in section 5 we give the conclusions ."
