    "we are anticipating that future measurements of cp - violating asymmetries in @xmath0 decays will cleanly and incisively test the standard model ( sm ) description of cp violation .",
    "physics beyond the sm could reveal itself through failures of the sm predictions for these asymmetries . as we shall see",
    ", the future experiments will provide a beautiful example of the workings of quantum mechanics .",
    "we first discuss the @xmath0-system test of the sm of cp violation .",
    "what quantities would one like to measure in order to carry out this test ?",
    "how can these quantities be measured cleanly ? which @xmath0 decay modes probe each quantity ?",
    "finally , how can physics beyond the sm affect the cp - violating effects to be studied ?",
    "we then turn to the quantum mechanics of the planned cp experiments at @xmath0 factories .",
    "these experiments will involve a very pretty modern example of an einstein  podolsky ",
    "rosen ( epr ) correlation .",
    "we show that the experiments can be understood through an approach based entirely on amplitudes , rather than on wave functions .",
    "this approach is manifestly covariant , and does not entail the somewhat mysterious ",
    "collapse of the wave function \" which is usually invoked to describe epr effects .",
    "according to the sm , cp violation is a consequence of the fact that in the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix ,    @xmath1    some of the elements are not real , but complex .",
    "cp - violating effects in @xmath0 decays can severely test this hypothesis by cleanly determining the phases of various products of ckm elements . in principle",
    ", one would like to determine all the independent phases of this kind . how may such independent phases exist , and what are they ?",
    "to answer this question , we recall that the sm requires the ckm matrix @xmath2 to be unitary . this unitarity imposes , among other constraints , the orthogonality conditions @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is an element of @xmath2 . for given @xmath5 , the orthogonality condition ( 2 )",
    "is conveniently pictured as the statement that the individual terms in the condition form the sides of a _ closed _ triangle ( a  unitarity triangle \" ) in the complex plane . from the existing information on the magnitudes of the various @xmath4 , we expect that the triangle for @xmath6 ( the  @xmath7 unitarity triangle \" ) will have sides of comparable length , so that its interior angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 may all be large . this triangle is shown schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "by contrast , we expect that in the @xmath10 unitarity triangle , the @xmath11 side is only @xmath12 as long as the other two sides .",
    "thus , the angle opposite the @xmath13 side , which we shall call @xmath14 is @xmath15 radians .",
    "similarly , we expect that in the @xmath16 triangle , the @xmath17 side is only @xmath18 as long as the other sides , so that the angle @xmath19 opposite this short side is @xmath20 radians .",
    "suppose , now , that @xmath21 is the phase of some convention - independent product of ckm elements . then it can be shown@xcite that @xmath22 where @xmath23 are integers .",
    "thus , the four angles @xmath24 and @xmath19 in the unitarity triangles are the independent phases of all possible ( convention - independent ) products of ckm elements .",
    "since the phases of ckm products are the quantities which will be determined by the experimental studies of cp violation in the @xmath0 system , these studies may be thought of as probes of these four angles .",
    "quite possibly , the angle @xmath19 , which is at most a few milliradians and leads to cp - violating effects which , correspondingly , are at most a few parts per @xmath25 , will prove to be beyond experimental reach .",
    "however , experiments which hopefully will determine the remaining angles , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are actively being developed .",
    "wolfenstein has introduced a very good @xmath28 approximation to the ckm matrix@xcite in which @xmath29 . in this approximation ,",
    "the only nontrivial independent phase angles are @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the @xmath7 triangle .",
    "for this reason , in the literature , attention has been properly focussed on this triangle .",
    "the goals of the experiments aimed at testing the sm of cp violation through studies of the @xmath0 system can be summarized in the following way : first , to measure the four independent angles of the unitarity triangles , or at least three of them @xmath32 ) .",
    "attention will be focussed first on the angles @xmath30 and @xmath31 , since these may both be large . secondly , to overconstrain the system as much as possible .",
    "to do so , one can : a ) see if cp asymmetries in different decay modes , which all yield the same angle ( say , @xmath31 ) _ if _ the sm of cp violation is correct , actually yield the same numerical result .",
    "( b ) measure independently the angles @xmath26 and the dependent angle @xmath9 in the @xmath7 triangle and see whether these three angles actually add up to @xmath33 .",
    "( c ) measure the lengths of the sides of the @xmath7 triangle ( via studies on non - cp - violating effects such as decay rates and neutral @xmath0 mixing ) , and then see whether the interior angles implied by these lengths agree with those inferred directly from cp - violating asymmetries . needless to say ,",
    "overconstraining the system in these ways will enable one to test whether the sm provides a consistent picture of cp - violating phenomena , or leads to inconsistencies which point to physics beyond the sm .",
    "the @xmath0 decays that can yield _",
    "clean _ information about the angles in the unitarity triangles are , for the most part , decays of the neutral @xmath0 mesons @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the physics of the @xmath36 system is similar to that of the @xmath37 system,@xcite so we shall discuss only the latter .",
    "the key feature of the @xmath37 system is that the @xmath34 and the @xmath38 mix . in the sm ,",
    "this mixing is due largely to the ww box diagram in fig .  2 .",
    "the @xmath39 amplitude induced by this higher - order diagram is a suppressed one , so that @xmath40 mixing mechanisms from beyond the sm could conceivably compete with or even dominate over the sm diagram .",
    "thus , the modication of @xmath41 mixing is perhaps the most promising route through which non - sm physics could modify cp violation in the @xmath0 system .",
    "the physics of the @xmath37 system is well - known .",
    "however , it is an important background to the quantum mechanical discussion of the next section , so we shall briefly review it .",
    "the @xmath37 system has two mass eigenstates , @xmath0-heavy @xmath42 and @xmath0-light @xmath43 , given by @xmath44 \\;.\\ ] ] here , @xmath45^{\\frac{1}{2}},$ ] where , here and hereafter , we use the letter @xmath46 to denote an amplitude .",
    "empirically , @xmath47 is known to be very close to unity , so that @xmath48 is just a phase factor .",
    "thus , only the _ phase _ of @xmath41 mixing affects @xmath49 and @xmath50 , and , through them , cp violation in neutral @xmath0 decay .    in the @xmath51",
    "is given by the box diagram in fig .",
    "the amplitude @xmath52 is then given by the same box diagram , but with every quark ( antiquark ) replaced by an antiquark ( quark ) .",
    "this replacement has the effect that every ckm factor in @xmath53 is replaced by its complex conjugate in @xmath52 thus , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the ",
    "@xmath56 mixing phase . \"    we shall write the masses of @xmath49 and @xmath50 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is their average mass , @xmath59 is their mass difference , and @xmath60 is their width , which they are expected to have in common .",
    "suppose that at a time @xmath61 a free neutral @xmath0 is a pure @xmath62 due to the mixing , at a later time @xmath63 it will no longer be a pure @xmath64 , but will have evolved into a state @xmath65 which is a superposition of @xmath64 and @xmath66 given by @xmath67 here , @xmath68 and @xmath69 note from eq .",
    "( 7 ) that , until it decays into some final state , the @xmath0 which at @xmath61 was a pure @xmath70 oscillates back and forth between being a pure @xmath70 and a pure @xmath71 this behavior will be important in the discussion of quantum mechanics in the next section .",
    "the decay @xmath72 of the time - evolved particle @xmath73 into some final state @xmath74 has a time - dependent rate , @xmath75 , which from eq .",
    "( 7 ) is given by @xmath76 let us assume that in this expression , the amplitude @xmath77 for the pure @xmath70 decay is dominated by a single feynman diagram .",
    "this assumption , which is expected to be a good one for some of the more important decay modes , is essentially the only assumption that the standard analysis of neutral @xmath0 decays entails . with this assumption",
    ", we may write @xmath78 here , @xmath79 is the magnitude of the dominating diagram , @xmath80 is the phase of the product of ckm elements to which this diagram is proportional , and @xmath81 is a phase due to strong - interaction effects .",
    "suppose , now , that @xmath74 is a cp eigenstate , so that @xmath82 , with @xmath83 the cp parity of @xmath74",

    "this is due to the circumstance that every quark in a process is replaced by its antiquark in the cp- mirror - image process , so that , as previously mentioned , every ckm factor is replaced by its complex conjugate .",
    "we have also used the fact that , apart from ckm phases , sm amplitudes are cp invariant , so that @xmath85 and @xmath87|t|cp[b_d]>$ ] have the same magnitude and strong phase . from eqs .",
    "( 8),(9 ) , and ( 10 ) , we have @xmath88 with @xmath89    when @xmath74 is a cp eigenstate , the cp mirror image of @xmath72 is @xmath90 where the time  evolved state @xmath91 was a pure @xmath92 at @xmath61 .",
    "since sm amplitudes for cp - mirror - image processes are identical except for having opposite ckm phases , eq .  ( 11 ) implies that the rate for @xmath93 , is given by @xmath94 the cp - violating asymmetry between @xmath95 and @xmath75 is then @xmath96 the mass difference @xmath59 is known ( at least for the @xmath97 system ) , and @xmath83 will be known for any chosen final state @xmath74 , so a measurement of this asymmetry will cleanly determine @xmath98.@xcite note from eq .",
    "( 12 ) that the angle @xmath21 that is determined in this way is , as previously stated , the phase of a product of ckm elements .",
    "while the case where @xmath74 is a cp eigenstate is , both theoretically and experimentally , the simplest one , clean information on the phases of products of ckm elements can also be extracted from many hadronic @xmath99 and @xmath100 decays where @xmath74 is not a cp eigenstate.@xcite the angle @xmath21 determined by decay into a final state which is not a cp eigenstate is no longer given by eq .",
    "( 12 ) , but is still the relative ckm phase of the two interfering amplitudes in the expression ( 8) for the decay rate .    in table 1",
    ", we list some decay modes that are being considered as possible probes of the various angles in the unitarity triangles .",
    "the last column of this table gives the angle that can be cleanly determined via study of each mode .",
    "the one charged b decay listed in the table illustrates the fact that occasionally even charged b decays can provide clean ckm phase information .",
    "experiments based on the decay modes of table 1 and others will be carried out both at dedicated high  luminosity @xmath101 colliders(b factories\")@xmath102 and at hadron facilities.@xmath103 these experiments , with their differing strong points , should prove to be quite complementary .",
    "how could physics beyond the sm ( pbsm ) affect cp violation in @xmath0 decays ?",
    "as we have seen , @xmath41 mixing , being suppressed in the sm , is perhaps the ingredient of cp violation in the @xmath0 system most susceptible to the effects of pbsm .",
    "let us briefly mention three examples of non - sm physics which , conceivably , could modify cp violation in @xmath0 decays by altering @xmath41 mixing .    1 .",
    "suppose that , in addition to the three known quark @xmath104 doublets , there is also a charge -1/3",
    "singlet.@xcite then , the @xmath105 boson can have quark couplings which , in mass - eigenstate basis , are nondiagonal .",
    "these nondiagonal couplings can carry phases beyond those in the 3 x 3 ckm matrix of the sm .",
    "thus , one can have at tree level the process @xmath106 and this non - sm contribution to @xmath107 mixing can carry a non - sm phase . by modifying the phase of @xmath56 mixing",
    ", this contribution can modify cp violation in @xmath99 decay .",
    "2 .   suppose that nature contains not just one higgs multiplet , as in the @xmath108 but several .",
    "then there can be spontaneous cp violation - a condition in which different neutral higgs fields develop vacuum expectation values which , relative to one another , are not real .",
    "new contributions to @xmath109 mixing can include tree - level processes of the type @xmath110 where @xmath111 is some neutral higgs boson .",
    "the spontaneous cp violation can impart to these processes nontrivial , non - sm phases .",
    "then , the phase of @xmath41 mixing , and consequently cp violation in neutral @xmath0 decay , is altered.@xcite 3 .",
    "suppose that the world is described by some version of supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "in non - minimal susy models , there can be new phases beyond those in the ckm matrix , and cp violation in the @xmath0 system can be altered substantially.@xcite however , there are also minimal susy models in which the avoidance of potentially large flavor changing neutral currents has the consequence that there are _ no _ extra phases beyond those in the ckm matrix .",
    "now , these models do contain non - sm contributions to @xmath41 mixing , such as the gluino - squark box diagram in fig .",
    "naively , one might imagine that these extra contributions have a different dependence on the ckm phases than does the sm box diagram of fig .  2 , so that the phase of @xmath41 mixing will differ from its sm value .",
    "however , in reality the ckm phases of the extra contributions are to a very good approximation identical to the ckm phase of the sm box diagram , so that the phase of @xmath41 mixing is _ the same _ as in the sm.@xcite now , we have seen that it is only the phase of the @xmath109 mixing amplitudes , and not their magnitudes , that influences cp violation .",
    "thus , cp violation in neutral @xmath0 decay will also be the same as in the sm .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the susy contributions to @xmath112 mixing , while not affecting cp violation , could still be uncovered by overconstraining the @xmath0 system .",
    "it is estimated that these contributions could change the magnitudes of the mixing amplitudes , and consequently the neutral @xmath0 mass differences @xmath113 by ( 10 - 20)%.@xcite in the sm , the difference @xmath114 between the masses of the mass eigenstates of the @xmath56 system arises from the box diagram in fig .  2 , and so is proportional to @xmath115 .",
    "the analogous mass difference @xmath116 in the @xmath117 system arises from a similar diagram in which the @xmath118 quarks have been replaced by @xmath119 quarks , and so is proportional to @xmath120 thus , in the sm , @xmath121 where the coefficient @xmath122 is expected to be approximately unity , and , more precisely , is estimated to be 0.86 @xmath123 0.1.@xcite now , we know from unitarity that @xmath124 , and @xmath125 is known to @xmath126 15% .",
    "thus , if @xmath127 mixing comes only from the sm box diagram , a measurement of @xmath128 would determine @xmath129 .",
    "since @xmath130 , we would then know the length of the @xmath131 side of the unitarity triangle of fig .  1 . if we had also learned , from other sources , the lengths of the other two sides , we could then deduce the interior angles .",
    "now , if @xmath41 mixing actually contains significant non - sm contributions from susy , then one might expect the sm relation ( 15 ) to fail .",
    "the length @xmath132 of the @xmath131 side of the unitarity triangle deduced from @xmath128 by using the relation ( 15 ) would then be wrong .",
    "thus , the interior angles of the triangle inferred from the alleged lengths of the sides would be wrong as well , and would disagree with the true interior angles determined by measurements of cp - violating asymmetries",
    ". this disagreement would be the signal of physics beyond the sm .",
    "unfortunately , it appears that the susy correction to @xmath133 or @xmath119 ) is proportional to its sm value .",
    "thus , although susy may change @xmath114 and @xmath116 individually by @xmath126 20% , it does not visibly alter their ratio from its sm size.@xcite hence , unlike the other models we mentioned , this minimal version of susy is an interesting example of non - sm physics whose presence could not be detected by studies of cp violation or mixing in neutral @xmath0 decays .",
    "the studies of cp violation to be performed at @xmath0 factories will involve some very interesting quantum mechanics , to which we now turn.@xcite    at the b factories , the @xmath0 mesons whose decays are to be studied will be produced via the reaction @xmath134 .",
    "the @xmath135 is a @xmath136 bound state which decays into @xmath0 pairs essentially 100% of the time .",
    "roughly half of its decays yield @xmath137 and the other half @xmath138 .",
    "( the @xmath135 is not heavy enough to decay to @xmath139 . )",
    "since it is mostly the decays of neutral @xmath0 mesons which can yield clean ckm phase information , we shall be interested in events where @xmath140 now , the @xmath135 has spin of unity , and @xmath0 mesons are spinless , so the @xmath0 pair produced by @xmath141 is in a _",
    "let us view this pair in the @xmath135 rest frame , where the @xmath0 mesons are moving outward in opposite directions from the @xmath135 decay point .",
    "due to @xmath56 mixing , each of the two @xmath0 mesons is oscillating back and forth between pure @xmath97 and pure @xmath92 ( see eq .",
    "however , at no time may we have two identical spinless bosons in a _",
    "thus , if at some time @xmath63 one of the @xmath0 mesons is found to be , say , a @xmath142 then at this time the other @xmath0 meson must be a @xmath97 .",
    "this is a modern example of an einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlation.@xcite    this epr correlation plays a crucial role in the traditional description@xcite of a typical @xmath0 factory experiment .",
    "let us recall this description . the sequence of events in the experiment , viewed from the @xmath135 rest frame , is shown in fig .",
    "4 . at a time we shall call @xmath61 , the @xmath135 decays into a pair of neutral b mesons , which move outward back to back . at a subsequent time @xmath143 ,",
    "one of the @xmath0 mesons decays semileptonically , and we shall suppose that it yields , in particular , a negatively - charged lepton @xmath144 , plus other particles @xmath145 at another time @xmath146 , the other @xmath0 meson decays into a hadronic cp eigenstate , which we shall take for illustration to be @xmath147 .    let us suppose first that the semileptonic decay occurs before the one to @xmath148 now , only a @xmath142 but not a @xmath149 can decay to a _ negative _ lepton , so the charge of the @xmath144 in fig .",
    "4 indentifies its parent as being a @xmath92 at the instant of decay , @xmath150 since , at any given time , one can not have two identical bosons in a _ p _",
    "wave , this means that _ at the same instant @xmath143 _ the other @xmath0 , on the right in fig .  4 , must be a pure @xmath97 .",
    "the decay of one @xmath0 into an @xmath144 has  collapsed the wave function \" for the @xmath151 state , leaving behind a single @xmath0 whose state , at the time of collapse , is known precisely .",
    "of course , subsequent to the time @xmath143 , the surviving @xmath0 will oscillate between pure @xmath97 and pure @xmath92 because of mixing . taking advantage of the fact that , in the @xmath135 rest frame , the @xmath0 mesons are rather nonrelativistic @xmath152 , we may neglect their motion .",
    "the probability for the @xmath0 which survives beyond @xmath143 to decay into the cp eigenstate @xmath147 is then given by the @xmath0-rest - frame expression ( 11 ) , in which to a very good approximation we need not distinguish between time in the @xmath0 rest frame and in the @xmath135 frame .",
