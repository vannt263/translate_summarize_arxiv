    "baryogenesis through leptogenesis represents an attractive mechanism to explain the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "once the standard model ( sm ) is extended by including the see - saw mechanism in order to explain the strong suppression of the neutrino mass scale @xcite , the possibility of generating a cosmic lepton asymmetry via the lepton number and @xmath3 violating out - of - equilibrium decays of the seesaw singlet neutrinos arises as a natural possibility .",
    "partial conversion of the lepton asymmetry into a baryon asymmetry then proceeds by means of electroweak sphaleron interactions @xcite that are non - perturbative sm processes .",
    "qualitatively , it is almost unavoidable that a model that includes the seesaw mechanism will predict a certain amount of matter - antimatter asymmetry surviving until the present epoch , and then the question of whether leptogenesis is able to explain the puzzle of the baryon asymmetry of the universe is essentially a quantitative one . in recent years",
    ", quantitative analysis of the standard leptogenesis scenario have become more and more sophisticated , taking into account many subtle but significant ingredients , such as various washout effects @xcite , thermal corrections to particle masses and @xmath3 violating asymmetries @xcite , spectator processes @xcite , flavor effects @xcite and the possible effects of the heaviest right handed majorana neutrinos @xmath5 @xcite ( for reviews of the most recent results see @xcite ) .",
    "one assumption that is common to all these studies is that between the scale of the breaking of lepton number and the electroweak breaking scale , there are no additional sources of new physics that could affect the mechanism of leptogenesis .",
    "this assumption is certainly justified both in terms of simplicity and also because it allows for a certain level of predictivity , that is mainly due to the fact that the same couplings that determine the @xmath3 asymmetries and the out - of - equilibrium conditions in the decays of the heavy majorana singlets are also responsible for the seesaw masses of the light neutrinos .",
    "in particular , in the standard seesaw model , successful leptogenesis implies a lower bound on the values of @xmath0 that , even in the most favorable case of dominant @xmath4 initial abundance @xcite , puts a direct test of leptogenesis out of the reach of any foreseeable experiment.gev @xcite seem to be possible . ]    in this paper we explore the implications of the presence below @xmath0 , of an additional energy scale related to the breaking of a new symmetry ( that could be for example a flavor symmetry ) .",
    "as we will see , in some cases a large enhancement of the @xmath3 asymmetry in @xmath4 decays is easily obtained , while at the same time the scale of leptogenesis can be lowered by several orders of magnitude without conflicting with other conditions .",
    "indeed , the scenario we will study can realize in a natural way some of the conditions needed to render leptogenesis viable down to the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "the main features of the model , that is directly inspired by @xmath1 models for flavor  la froggatt - nielsen  @xcite are outlined in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ sec",
    ": cp - asymmetries ] , after reviewing the main results of standard leptogenesis , we highlight the most important new features that stem from the presence of the extra mass scale . in section  [ sec",
    ": conclusions ] we present the conclusions . in the appendix",
    "we consider a minimal scenario where one light neutrino remains massless , and we derive a simple analytical expression for the ratio between the new mass scale and @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that at some large scale close to the leptogenesis scale a horizontal @xmath6 symmetry forbids direct couplings between the lepton doublets @xmath7 and the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath8 .",
    "light neutrino masses can arise because of the presence of heavy vectorlike fields @xmath9 that are singlets with respect to @xmath10 and charged under the additional @xmath6 factor , and that couple to both the majorana fields and to the lepton doublets @xmath7 .",
    "we use greek indices @xmath11 to denote the heavy majorana neutrinos and we write the lagrangian in terms of self - conjugate majorana spinors @xmath12 .",
    "latin indices @xmath13 will denote the heavy dirac fields with @xmath14 , and latin indices @xmath15 will denote the sm left - handed lepton doublets @xmath16 .",
    "the following lagrangian gives a simple realization of this scheme : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 higgs doublet and @xmath20 is a complex scalar that is a singlet under @xmath10 and charged under @xmath6 .",
    "the scalar @xmath20 is responsible for breaking the additional symmetry through a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath21 that we assume to be somewhat smaller than the mass scale of the vectorlike fields @xmath22 .",
    "a simple @xmath6 charge assignment that forbids the @xmath23 coupling and yields the lagrangian ( [ eq : lag ] ) is for example @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    to put in evidence the main consequences of our scheme without complicating too much the discussion and the results",
    ", we assume that to a good approximation the heavy dirac fields @xmath27 couple to the majorana neutrinos in a pure vectorlike way .",
    "that is , we assume @xmath28 , and we neglect all the effects related to the pseudoscalar couplings . including also the pseudoscalar interactions would give rise to additional diagrams contributing for example to the total decay width of the majorana neutrinos and to the decay @xmath3 asymmetries , without changing our main conclusions .",
    "let us note that all the interaction terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) also preserve a @xmath1 ( accidental ) global symmetry with assignment @xmath29 and @xmath30 , that we can readily identify with lepton number . then , as in the standard seesaw model , this symmetry is broken ( by two units ) only by the @xmath31 majorana mass term . as regards the @xmath6 symmetry , if for all the sm fields the charges @xmath32 were proportional to @xmath33 , this symmetry would leave unaffected all the charged leptons and quarks yukawa couplings .",
    "in contrast , if the set of @xmath32 charges for the quarks and leptons is not a trivial one , @xmath6 could play a role as ( part of ) a flavor symmetry of the kind proposed long ago by froggatt and nielsen  @xcite .",
    "however , for the present discussion the issue if @xmath6 also contributes to determine the charged fermion mass pattern is to a large extent irrelevant , and accordingly we will not necessarily adopt all the assumptions that realize the naturalness conditions of flavor models based on abelian symmetries , and in particular :    * we do not constrain the couplings in the lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) to be all of the same size and of order unity .",
    "* we do not need to specify any precise value for the ratio @xmath34 .",
    "* we do not constrain from below by means of fcnc considerations the scale of @xmath6 breaking ( this is consistent if e.g. we take @xmath35 ) .",
    "after @xmath6 and electroweak symmetry breaking , the light neutrino mass matrix arising from ( [ eq : lag ] ) reads @xmath36_{ij } =   \\left[\\tilde\\lambda^t \\frac{v^2}{m_n}\\tilde\\lambda\\right]_{ij}\\ ] ] where for convenience we have introduced the effective seesaw couplings @xmath37 that is , with respect to the standard seesaw mechanism the light neutrino masses have an additional suppression factor of the ratio @xmath38 and are of fourth order in the fundamental couplings ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .    an important point to note",
    "is that in order to ensure that two light neutrino are massive , as is required by oscillation neutrino data , a minimum field content of two right - handed neutrinos @xmath41 and two vectorlike fields @xmath27 is needed .",
    "a straightforward analysis then shows that even in this minimal scheme , both the matrices of the @xmath40 and @xmath39 coupling constants contain physical complex phases that can be relevant for leptogenesis .    to summarize , in this model besides the electroweak breaking scale @xmath42 we have the following new mass scales :    * the mass scale of the heavy vectorlike fields , @xmath43 .",
    "* the lepton number breaking scale , @xmath44 . * the horizontal symmetry breaking scale , @xmath45 .",
    "the consequences of the different hierarchies amongst these new scales is studied in detail in section [ sec : cp - asymmetries ] .",
    "in this section we present the detailed results for the @xmath3 asymmetry in @xmath4 decays for the different cases as are determined by the hierarchy between the relevant scales @xmath0 , @xmath43 and @xmath45 , and we will explore qualitatively the implications of the different possibilities .",
    "as already said , we take @xmath4 to be the lightest one of the majorana neutrinos , and @xmath46 to be the lightest of the vectorlike fields . for the different mass ratios we adopt the following notation : @xmath47 the @xmath3-asymmetry in the decay of the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath4 is defined in the usual way as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent respectively the partial decay rates of @xmath4 into particles with lepton number @xmath51 and antiparticles with lepton number @xmath52 ( regardless of the fact that they are @xmath7 or @xmath2 states ) . a non - vanishing numerator in eq.([eq : cpdecay ] ) can arise from the interference between tree - level and loop - amplitudes , and the total decay rate in the denominator can be approximated with the tree level result .",
    "when the ratio in eq.([eq : cpdecay ] ) is phase - space independent , as is the case in two - body decays , the @xmath3-asymmetry can be simply calculated in terms of products of the tree - level @xmath53 and loop @xmath54 amplitudes . however , when there is a dependence on the phase space as is the case for three - body decays discussed in section  [ sec : case1 ] , the full decay widths have to be taken into account .    in standard leptogenesis models",
    "the lepton number breaking scale is constrained by the out - of - equilibrium condition on the decay rate of @xmath4 , and as the scale of lepton number violation is lowered , in order to satisfy this condition the size of the @xmath4 yukawa couplings must be accordingly reduced .",
    "if we further require that the neutrino oscillation data are accounted for just by the ( type 1 ) seesaw mass matrix , and we forbid any additional source for the light neutrino masses , then it can be shown that a large suppression of the @xmath3 asymmetry in @xmath4 decays is unavoidable .",
    "then the requirement that the final lepton asymmetry is large enough to account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe , implies a lower bound on the mass of @xmath4 that is several orders of magnitude larger than the electroweak breaking scale .    as we will discuss below , in some cases",
    "the presence of a new scale and of a new set of couplings associated with it can allow to satisfy the out - of - equilibrium condition and to account for the light neutrino mass scale , without necessarily implying any particular suppression of the @xmath3 asymmetries , even when @xmath0 is lowered down to the tev scale .",
    "this ` decoupling ' of the size of the @xmath3 asymmetry from the decay width @xmath49 and from the scale of the light neutrino masses is rendered possible by the fact that , while the latter two quantities are mainly controlled by the @xmath39 parameters that couple the heavy vectorlike fields @xmath2 to the right handed neutrino @xmath4 , the @xmath3 asymmetry is essentially determined by the couplings @xmath40 between the fermions @xmath2 and the lepton doublets @xmath7 .      when the masses of the heavy dirac fields and the @xmath6 symmetry breaking scale are both larger than the majorana neutrino masses ( @xmath56 ) there are no major differences from the standard fukugita - yanagida leptogenesis model @xcite .",
