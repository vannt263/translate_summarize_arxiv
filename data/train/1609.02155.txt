    "<S> the nature of warm , ionized gas outside of galaxies may illuminate several key galaxy evolutionary processes . a serendipitous observation by the manga survey has revealed a large , asymmetric @xmath0 complex with no optical counterpart that extends @xmath1 ( @xmath2 kpc ) beyond the effective radius of a dusty , starbursting galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath0 extension is approximately three times the effective radius of the host galaxy and displays a tail - like morphology . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze its gas - phase metallicities , gaseous kinematics , and emission - line ratios , and discuss whether this @xmath0 extension could be diffuse ionized gas , a gas accretion event , or something else . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this warm , ionized gas structure is most consistent with gas accretion through recycled wind material , which could be an important process that regulates the low - mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function .    </S>",
