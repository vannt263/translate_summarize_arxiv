    "the observational investigation of the formation of young and very massive stars ( with l@xmath2 @xmath3 10@xmath4 @xmath5 , _ i.e. _ o - type ) has been inherently a difficult task .",
    "these young stars are rare and found far away from us , at typical distances of more than 2 kpc .",
    "their evolutionary time scales are also much shorter than those found in low and intermediate mass stars @xcite . at present",
    ", there is only a handful of very massive star forming regions that have been extensively studied at infrared , ( sub)millimeter , and/or radio wavelengths using sensitive , high angular resolution observations .",
    "some of them include g240.31 + 0.07 @xcite , iras 16547 - 4247 @xcite , w51 north @xcite , ngc 7538 irs1 @xcite , and g24 a1 @xcite .",
    "these young o - type stars are found in association with large ( @xmath0 5000 au ) accreting rotating structures that seem to energize powerful bipolar outflows suggesting that these stars may form in a similar way to the low mass stars , _ i.e. _ via outflows and disks .",
    "however , it is very likely that those large accreting structures are forming more than one single high - mass star at once .",
    "these structures then are not disks in the sense of accretion disks that funnel gas to a single star .    here",
    ", we present high angular resolution archival observations using the submillimeter array at millimeter wavelengths towards the extremely large accreting structure surrounding the o - type protostar ngc 7538 s. this is a cold core with a size of 0.5 pc , and a dust mass of @xmath0 2000 @xmath5 associated with h@xmath6o , oh and ch@xmath7oh ( but not sio ) maser emission , and weak free - free emission @xcite .",
    "this region is at a distance of 2.65 @xmath8 0.12 kpc @xcite . in the middle of this cold core",
    "resides a large ( @xmath0 15  000 au ) and massive ( @xmath0 400 @xmath5 ) structure interpreted as a nearly edge - on rotating disk that surrounds a protostar with a mass between 20  40 m@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , the values reported by @xcite , which should be the most recent estimates , are significantly lower , 85 - 115 m@xmath9 for the putative disk , and 14 - 24 m@xmath9 for the enclosed mass of the central protostar and the inner , rotationally supported part of the disk .",
    "a single , young , and powerful outflow perpendicular to the rotating disk has also been mapped in molecular lines that includes sio ( _ j_=2 - 1 ) and hco@xmath10(_j_=1 - 0 ) @xcite .",
    "the bipolar outflow is compact ( 0.2 pc ) , has a low velocity ( @xmath11 @xmath0 40 km s@xmath12 ) , and has its blueshifted side towards the northwest , and the redshifted one to the southeast .",

    "we concatenated the uv - data from both configurations to make the line emission map .",
    "it is important to mention that in these observations many more lines were detected .",
    "however , in this work we concentrate only on the molecular distribution of the sio .",
    "this molecule is well known to be good tracer of high density gas in outflows with critical densities of more than 10@xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "in figure 1 , we show the resulting millimeter ( @xmath28 = 1300 @xmath47 m ) continuum image obtained with the sma in the compact and extended configurations from the high - mass star forming region ngc 7538 s. from the compact configuration , we detect a single northeast - southwest extended dusty source reported for the first time by @xcite and interpreted as an extremely large edge - on circumstellar disk . however , @xcite made bima and carma observations and resolved the large and massive disk into four compact millimeter sources ( s@xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "the nature of these source is still in debate .",
    "this source has a deconvolved size of @xmath48 with a position angle @xmath49 .",
    "its total flux density at this wavelength is 4.1 @xmath8 0.5 jy . on the other hand , in the extended configuration , we resolved the elongated dusty source into five compact sources ( sma1 - 5 ) , with the compact objects being located along the major axis of the source detected with the compact configuration .",
    "these compact sources have sizes of about 1.5@xmath31 ( or 3000 au at the distance of ngc 3875 s , see table 1 ) .",
    "the deconvolved parameters of the sources sma3/4 were determined by fitting a two - dimensional gaussian function to the observed flux distribution using the task jmfit of aips .",
    "sma3 was well resolved using this method while for the fainter source sma4 failed .",
    "thus , we only give the position on the sky for sma4 . a better estimation of the deconvolved sizes of sma3/4 ( carma s@xmath24 and s@xmath26 ) are given in @xcite .",
    "four of these sources ( sma1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) coincide well with the positions of the four compact sources found by @xcite using observations of carma / bima , which they propose to certainly have a protostellar nature .",
    "the source sma 5 does not have any counterpart at mm wavelengths as revealed by the figure 8 of @xcite .",
    "we are thus caution about if this source is real or is an artifact by poor the uv - sampling . however , as our synthesized beam is larger to the ones obtained by the carma and bima observations in @xcite , perhaps , we are only recovering some more extended emission and revealing the non - compact sources .",
    "the density fluxes for the sources sma1 , 2 , 3 and 4 that we obtained here were larger ( by a factor of more than 3 ) than those obtained by @xcite , again probably because we are recovering more extended emission .",
    "the deconvolved sizes are in good agreement with those presented in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we adopted a value of @xmath50 = 0.1 @xmath51 g@xmath12 @xcite and assumed optically thin , isothermal dust emission and a gas - to - dust ratio of 100 , with a dust temperature of 30 k @xcite for these millimeter compact objects , deriving dust masses of about 10 solar masses ( see table 1 ) . from our compact configuration observations",
    ", we estimate that the elongated northeast - southwest dusty structure reported by @xcite and @xcite has a mass of 350 @xmath5 , which is in very good agreement with the mass obtained by those authors .",
    "the assumption of a dust temperature of 30 k appears justified , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for example , zheng et al . ( 2001 ) find ammonia to be optically thick in the direction of ngc 7538 s with a temperature of 25 k , however , the low resolution of the observations did not allow to measure the temperatures of every single mm component of ngc 7538 s.    we noted that @xcite obtained a mass of 60 m@xmath9 for the source carma s@xmath24 or sma3 .",
    "this value is very different from that we obtained ( about 10 m@xmath9 ) .",
    "this discrepancy could arise from the low value of @xmath52 = 0.002 @xmath51 g@xmath12 they used .",
    "there is not a general consensus of using a singular value , however , this dust mass opacity at this wavelength seems to be too low ..      in our 2 ghz lower side band of the observations , we detected the line sio ( _ j_=5 - 4 ) at a rest frequency of 217.104 ghz . in figure 2",
    ", we present a map of the intensity , integrated over velocity ( moment 0 ) , of the sio line emission observed towards ngc7538s .",
    "the map is additionally overlaid with the two maps of the continuum emission obtained from the compact and extended configurations ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the velocity integration is over the velocity ranges : @xmath5370 to @xmath5357 km s@xmath12 ( blue ) and @xmath5353 to @xmath5340 km s@xmath12 ( red ) .",
    "this map reveals at least two collimated and bipolar outflows emanating from ngc 7538 s , all with similar orientations .",
    "the bipolar outflows emanate with their blueshifted sides toward the northwest while the redshifted sides to the southeast .",
    "these outflows have position angles of approximately @xmath5345@xmath29 and with collimation angles of less than 10@xmath29 .",
    "the extension of the outflows is about 0.1 pc .",
    "there is one more bipolar outflow , revealed here for the first time , which is located about 7@xmath31 north of ngc 7538 s ( figure 2 ) .",
    "however , we do not find any millimeter continuum source in the outflow center .",
    "the outflow is also very collimated and with a similar orientation to those found in ngc 7538 s. an infrared study with the archive images of the spitzer infrared telescope revealed an infrared ( 3.6 @xmath54 ) faint source in the middle of the outflow , whose position is r.a .",

    "we suggest that this infrared source could be its exciting source .",
    "for the rest of the outflows in the field , the compact millimeter sources reported here ( sma1 , 2 and 3 ) appear to be exciting them .",
    "we also find an irac ( 4.5 and 5.8 @xmath54 ) source associated with the millimeter compact source sma3 & 4 .",
    "the infrared emission detected towards this object might suggest a more evolved evolutionary state compared with the rest of the compact millimeter sources .",
    "however , the nature of this infrared source is uncertain and an in - deep infrared study of the sma3 & 4 is beyond of the scope of the present letter .",
    "the collection of collimated outflows reported here appear to be part of the massive , bipolar , unresolved outflow reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this has similar position angle ( @xmath20148@xmath29 ) , range of radial velocities ( @xmath5380 , @xmath5340 km s@xmath12 ) , and projected size ( 25@xmath31 or 0.2 pc ) .",
    "the compact source sma3/4 is additionally associated with a radio thermal jet with an orientation similar to the molecular outflows @xcite also suggesting that this might be the exciting source of another outflow .",
    "following @xcite , and assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , that the molecular emission is optically thin , an excitation temperature of 50 k , and an abundance ratio of sio / h@xmath6 equal to 1 @xmath36 10@xmath55 , we can estimate the mass of the outflows for the sio molecule in the transition _ j _ = 5 - 4 .",
    "we obtain a mass of about 10 @xmath5 for each outflow .",
    "it is important to mention that the fractional abundance between the silicon monoxide and the molecular hydrogen varies from one star - forming region ( sfr ) to another , and thus the mass of the outflow can be over / underestimated .",
    "the value for the fractional abundance assumed here seems to be consistent for a few sfrs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for a mechanical force of f@xmath56",
    "= 10 @xmath5 10 km s@xmath12/10,000 yr = 0.01 @xmath5 km s@xmath12 yr@xmath12 , and from the correlation presented in @xcite for the outflow mechanical force versus the bolometric luminosity of the exciting source , we very roughly estimate a luminosity for the central powering sources of the order of 10@xmath45 l@xmath9 , which corresponds to a massive b - type protostar .",
    "this spectral type for the central star is in good agreement with that obtained from the dust emission , as we estimated on the last section .",
    "figure 4 shows a filament forming in a new numerical simulation of molecular cloud formation by converging warm neutral medium ( wnm ) flows , similar to the one presented by @xcite , but with 8 times higher mass resolution .",
    "the simulation will be described in detail in a separate contribution , but here we give the basic details .",
    "it was performed with the sph code gadget 2 @xcite , with a prescription for `` sink '' particle creation first applied by @xcite . according to this prescription ,",
    "when the local density @xmath57 at any location within the simulation exceeds a certain threshold density @xmath58 , the sph gas particles within that region are replaced by a single sink particle , whose mass and momentum equal the sums of the masses and momenta of the removed gas particles . after being created , the sink particles behave as point masses , and can continue to accrete gas from a region of radius @xmath59 around them , if such gas is gravitationally bound to the sinks .",
    "the present simulation contains @xmath60 sph particles , and starts at a volume density @xmath61 and @xmath62 k , in a numerical box of 256 pc per side .",
    "the total mass in the box is thus @xmath63 . in this box",
    ", we set up as initial velocity conditions two cylindrical gas streams of radius 32 pc and length 112 pc , about to collide head - on at the plane @xmath64 pc ( i.e. , at the middle of the box ) , with velocity @xmath65 ( for more details on this setup , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the sink particle parameters ,",
    "we choose @xmath66 and @xmath67 pc .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "4 shows the column density at time 27.3 myr in a @xmath68 pc region on the @xmath69 plane , near the center of the simulation , with a density integration over the range @xmath70 pc . in this region ,",
    "a long filament has formed by gravitational contraction , with several star - forming sites along it .",
    "the square in the left panel of fig",
    ".  4 delimits the region shown in the right panel .",
    "this panel shows the smaller - scale filament arising within the larger one , immediately after forming three sink ( stellar ) particles , with masses @xmath71 each .",
    "the similarity between the filament+sinks system in the simulation and ngc7538 s is striking . the length spanned by the three sinks , as seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "3 , is @xmath72 pc , while the corresponding length in ngc 7538 s is @xmath73 , corresponding to @xmath74 pc .",
    "the sinks in the simulation , as well as the individual sources in ngc 7538 s are almost evenly spaced .",
    "the width of the filament containing the sinks in the simulation is also of approximately the same size , as is the width of the dust - emitting region in the source ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we can also estimate the column density of ngc 7538 s , and compare it to that of the filament in the simulation .",
    "the estimated mass of the region is @xmath75 . assuming that it has the same extension along the line of sight as it is wide on the plane of the sky ( @xmath76 pc ) , and a cylindrical shape , with length @xmath77 pc , the resulting column density is @xmath78 , which compares very well with the range of column densities for the filament in the simulation ( right panel of fig .",
    "finally , it is worth remarking that ngc 7538 s is located within a larger filament spanning at least @xmath79 ( corresponding to @xmath80 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the filament from the simulation shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "3 can be seen in the left panel of the same figure to be part of a larger filament , spanning also @xmath81 pc ( the filament containing the box in this figure ) .",
    "note , however , that , in the simulation , this filament is in a state of gravitational contraction , both accreting mass in the direction perpendicular to its axis as well as contracting along this axis . nevertheless , the simulated filament is seen to strongly resemble the observed one in both size scale and spacing of the newly - formed stars .",
    "the dimensions ( @xmath0 3000 au ) , masses ( of about 10 @xmath5 ) , and the fact that from most of the sources molecular collimated outflows or thermal jets emerge , suggest that those compact sources are probably large envelopes or perhaps dusty large disks associated with massive stars in the process of formation .",
    "we thus conclude that ngc 7538 s is not likely to be a single , young o - type star surrounded by an extremely large disk , but rather maybe a large contracting or rotating filament that is fragmenting at scales of 0.1 pc to 0.01 pc to form multiple high - mass stars that involve outflows , envelopes and disks .",
    "similar molecular and dusty fragmenting filaments have already been reported in the literature in omc3 and g28.34 + 0.06 @xcite .",
    "for the case of g28.34 + 0.06 , observations also from the sma revealed a string of five dust cores of along the 1 pc ir - dark filament called g28.34 + 0.06 .",
    "the cores are well aligned at a position angle of @xmath2048@xmath29 , and are regularly spaced , with an average projected separation of 0.16 pc . for omc3 , there is a large filament that also fragments at scales of 0.01 pc to form the the protostellar object mm7 @xcite .",
    "this large filament also shows large velocity gradients along it .",
    "this case is very similar to the case of ngc 7538 s reported here .",
    "following @xcite and using the density derived from the emission detected in the compact configuration ( 1.3 @xmath36 10@xmath82 @xmath46 ) , a velocity dispersion with a thermal line width ( assuming 30 k ) of 0.77 km s@xmath12 ( dispersion of 0.33 s@xmath12 ) , we estimate a jeans mass of m@xmath83 = 0.76 @xmath5 and a jeans length of @xmath84 = 1930 au .",
    "thus , for our case , the jeans mass is smaller than the measured masses ( by one order of magnitude , as in g28 ) , and the jeans length is slightly smaller than the measured separation between the fragments .",
    "so we also conclude , in agreement with @xcite , that thermal pressure does not seem to be enough to support the source , which appears to be a filament , so that either additional support needs to be invoked , or else that the filament is in the process of gravitational contraction , as is the case of the filament in the numerical simulation presented here .",

    "<S> we report on high - sensitivity and high - angular resolution archival submillimeter array ( sma ) observations of the large ( @xmath015000 au ) putative circumstellar disk associated with the o - type protostar ngc 7538 s. observations of the continuum resolve this putative circumstellar disk into five compact sources , with sizes @xmath0 3000 au and masses @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this confirm the results of recent millimeter observations made with carma / bima towards this object . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that from most of these compact sources eject collimated bipolar outflows , revealed by our silicon monoxide ( sio _ j_=5 - 4 ) observations and confirm that these sources have a ( proto)stellar nature . </S>",
    "<S> all outflows are perpendicular to the large and rotating dusty structure . </S>",
    "<S> we propose therefore that , rather than being a single massive circumstellar disk , ngc 7538 s could be instead a large and massive contracting or rotating filament that is fragmenting at scales of 0.1 to 0.01 pc to form several b - type stars , via the standard process involving outflows and disks . </S>",
    "<S> as in recent high spatial resolution studies of dusty filaments , our observations also suggest that thermal pressure does not seem to be sufficient to support the filament , so that either additional support needs to be invoked , or else the filament must be in the process of collapsing . </S>",
    "<S> an sph numerical simulation of the formation of a molecular cloud by converging warm neutral medium flows produces contracting filaments whose dimensions and spacings between the stars forming within them , as well as their column densities , strongly resemble those observed in the filament reported here . </S>"
