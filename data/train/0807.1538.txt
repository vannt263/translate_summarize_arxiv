    "cosmic shear , which refers to the weak gravitational lensing by large - scale structure in the universe , is an invaluable tool in cosmology since it directly probes the gravitational clustering of dark matter in the universe without concerns about light - to - matter bias .",
    "very recently , the three dimensional map of dark matter distribution has been indeed reconstructed on cosmological scales from the measurements of cosmic shear @xcite , which marks an advent of _ lensing cosmology_. among many lensing observables , the angular power spectrum is regarded particularly important , since it is in principle capable of constraining the key cosmological parameters with high precision , including the enigmatic nature of dark energy ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "the success of the angular power spectrum as a cosmological probe , however , is subject to one critical issue : how much information does it preserve about the initial conditions of the universe ?",
    "a natural expectation is that some but not all information might have been destroyed in the subsequent nonlinear evolution .",
    "the amount of information contained in the power spectrum about the initial cosmological conditions is directly related to the precision of the cosmological parameters constrained by using the matter power spectrum . in other words , the non - gaussian errors caused by the loss of information in the power spectrum would propagate into large uncertainties in the determination of the cosmological parameters . the error propagation and precision on cosmological parameters can be quantified in terms of the fisher information contained in the matter power spectrum @xcite .",
    "* hereafter , rh05 ) have for the first time estimated the fisher information in the matter power spectrum .",
    "basically , rh05 have calculated the information content about the amplitude of the linear power spectrum averaged over an ensemble of many n - body realizations and found very little independent information at the translinear scale .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , however , rh05 also found that there is a sharp rise in the amount of information in the nonlinear scale ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been also noted by the analytic work of @xcite .    yet , according to the recent results derived by @xcite based on the halo model , the fisher information in the density power spectrum about all key cosmological parameters including the initial amplitude is highly degenerate both in the translinear and the nonlinear regime . their work has indicated that it might not be possible to extract the initial cosmological conditions from the nonlinear dark matter power spectrum to a high statistical accuracy .",
    "thus , the previous numerical and analytic results forecast that the accuracy in the determination of the cosmological parameters in lensing cosmology may be lower due to the non - gaussian errors . as the next generation of large surveys optimized for weak lensing",
    "will soon be on the pipeline , it is imperative to test observationally the information content in the lensing power spectrum . in this letter",
    "we attempt to do this test by applying the rh05 technique to the photometric galaxy catalogs from the sloan digital sky survey data release 5 ( sdss dr5 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at typical lens redshifts @xmath4 .",
    "we use the photoz2 and the photoprimary catalog which are both publicly available at the web site of the sdss dr5 ( http://www.sdss.org/dr5 ) .",
    "the photoz2-catalog contains information on galaxy photometric redshift ( photo - z , @xmath5 ) , while the photoprimary catalog has imaging data of galaxy right ascension ( @xmath6 ) , declination ( @xmath7 ) , and dereddened model magnitude ( @xmath8 ) . for our analysis , we select those galaxies in the catalog whose dereddened model magnitude , photo - z and angular positions satisfy the constraints of @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ; @xmath11 ; @xmath12 .",
    "selected are a total of @xmath13 galaxies which we divide into smaller samples according to their angular positions and photo - z s .",
    "we first decompose the selected portion of the sky into 55 cells , each having approximately same linear size of @xmath14 . to make equal - size cells on _ non - flat _ sky ,",
    "the bin size of @xmath7 is set at the constant value of @xmath15 , while the bin size of @xmath6 is adjusted by a factor of @xmath16 to compensate for the decrease in the width of @xmath17 with @xmath7 . here ,",
    "we choose @xmath18 as the median value of @xmath7 at each cell .",
    "we end up with having a total of @xmath19 cells on the plane of the sky in the selected angular range .",
    "table [ tab : data ] lists the ranges of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , a total number of galaxies ( @xmath20 ) and cells ( @xmath21 ) in four photo - z slices .",
    "we treat approximately each cell as a square region and decompose it further into @xmath22 pixels of equal size . counting the number of galaxies at each pixel , we find those pixels where no galaxy is located and mask them and their nearest neighbor pixels as gap regions , assigning zero density contrast . after masking the gap regions , we bin the selected photo - z range with bin size of @xmath23 . a set of @xmath19 cells in each redshift slice represents an ensemble of realizations for the calculation of the galaxy angular power spectrum .",
    "the size of the field is well in linear regime , so the small - size cells should be reasonably independent .",
    "note that we do nt include the effect of beat - coupling discussed in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "for each cell in each photo - z slice , we construct the two dimensional density field on @xmath22 pixels by determining the dimensionless density contrast @xmath24 as residual number density of the galaxies , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the number density of the galaxies belonging to a given pixel , and @xmath27 is the mean number density of galaxies averaged over a given cell in a given photo - z slice . for the calculation of the mean number density @xmath27",
    ", we exclude the gap regions , counting only unmasked pixels .",
    "ccccc @xmath28 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath19 + @xmath32 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath33 & @xmath19 + @xmath34 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath35 & @xmath19 + @xmath36 & @xmath29 & @xmath30 & @xmath37 & @xmath19 + [ tab : data ]    then , we perform the fourier - transformation of the two dimensional density field with the help of the fft routine provided in the numerical recipes @xcite and calculate the galaxy angular power spectrum , @xmath38 , as a function of a multipole @xmath39 in the fourier space : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a two dimensional multipole vector representing the fourier transform of the two dimensional angular position vector , @xmath42 is the total number of pixels in a given cell ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 represents the number of pixels which do not belong to the masked gap regions in a given cell .",
    "we weight the angular power spectrum by a factor of @xmath45 to compensate for the zero powers assigned to the gap regions @xcite .",
    "the average fraction of @xmath46 is found to be @xmath47 .    the galaxy angular power spectrum , @xmath38 , obtained by equation ( [ eqn : wg ] ) includes the shot - noise . to eliminate the shot - noise power from a given cell to which a total of @xmath20 galaxies belong , we construct a random sample of equal number of galaxies by generating the values of ( @xmath7 , @xmath6 ) randomly .",
    "if a randomly generated galaxy is found to fall in gap regions , we regenerate ( @xmath7,@xmath6 ) till it belongs to a unmasked pixel . using this random sample of @xmath20 galaxies ,",
    "we repeat the whole process : constructing the density field on @xmath22 pixels , fourier - transforming the density field , calculating the shot - noise power spectrum , @xmath48 , which is also weighted by the same factor of @xmath49 .",
    "finally , we subtract the shot - noise power spectrum , @xmath50 , from @xmath38 , to obtain the shot - noise - free angular power spectrum , @xmath51 for all @xmath19 cells in each photo - z slice .    , averaged over @xmath19 cells in four photo - z slices : @xmath52 ( open squares ) ; @xmath53 ( open triangles ) ; @xmath54 ( open circles ) ; @xmath55 ( open stars ) .",
    "the errors are calculated as one standard deviation in the measurement of the mean angular power spectrum .",
    "the dotted lines represent the cases before the shot - noise subtraction.,width=307 ]    figure [ fig : pow ] plots the mean angular power spectra , @xmath56 , averaged over @xmath19 cells after the shot - noise subtraction as solid lines with errors for four different photo - z slices .",
    "the errors , @xmath57 , are calculated as one standard deviation in the measurement of the mean angular power spectrum averaged over @xmath19 cells belonging to each photo - z slice : @xmath58 . for the comparison , the mean angular power spectrum , @xmath59 , before the shot - noise subtraction is also plotted as dotted lines . as can be seen , before the shot - noise subtraction , the slope of the mean angular power spectrum changes from @xmath60 to @xmath61 as the multipole @xmath39 increases .",
    "after the shot - noise subtraction , its slope stays constant at @xmath60 .",
    "the fluctuations of the angular power spectrum at the lowest multipole ( @xmath62 ) represent the presence of the sample variance caused by the finite size of the sky cells .",
    "note that the amplitude of the angular power spectrum decreases with photo - z , indicating the growth of powers .",
    "here , we focus mainly on the photo - z ranges of @xmath63 : at higher photo - z ( @xmath64 ) , the shot - noise will dominate ; at lower photo - z ( @xmath65 ) , due to the increase of the fractional distance errors , the three dimensional analysis will be necessary to measure the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the angular power spectrum estimated in  2 is supposed to contain information about the amplitude of the linear power spectrum : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the log of the amplitude of the linear density power spectrum . according to rh05 , the fisher information contained in the angular power spectrum about the amplitude of the linear power spectrum can be written as @xcite @xmath68 here @xmath69 represents the inverse of the covariance matrix whose components are given as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the scatter of the angular power spectrum from the mean value at a given multipole @xmath39 .",
    "as explained in detail by @xcite , for the case of linear power spectrum , @xmath72 , from the gaussian density fluctuations , the inverse of the covariance matrix is diagonal and equation ( [ eqn : cov ] ) will be simplified into @xmath73 since @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the number of gaussian modes around the multipole @xmath77 .",
    "rh05 asserted that the amount of information preserved in the nonlinear power spectrum depends on the existence of an invertible one - to - one mapping between the linear and nonlinear regime .",
    "if such a mapping exists , then the same amount of information that the linear power spectrum contains about the initial amplitude can be extracted also from the nonlinear power spectrum . if not",
    ", then it would be difficult to determine the initial amplitudes with high precision from the nonlinear power spectrum .",
    "however , note that what we have measured in  2 is the _ nonlinear galaxy power spectrum_. unlike the nonlinear matter power spectrum that is reasonably well understood @xcite , the non - linear clustering of galaxies is rather heuristic and usually constructed to fit the data .",
    "although the non - linear galaxy power spectrum @xmath51 is known to be neither the nonlinear matter power spectrum nor the linear matter power spectrum , we set @xmath51 to the linear matter power spectrum @xmath78 for simplicity .        using the mean angular power spectra measured at four photo - z slices , we first calculate the normalized covariance matrix defined as @xmath79 figure [ fig : cov ] plots the magnitudes of ( @xmath80 ) as grey scales for the cases of four photo - z slices : @xmath28 , @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath36 in the panel ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively . as can be seen ,",
    "the magnitudes of the off - diagonal elements of ( @xmath80 ) deviate from zero , which suggests the reduced amount of information than the case of gaussian fluctuations .",
    "finding the inverse of the covariance matrix , @xmath81 , we calculate the cumulative information @xmath82 contained in the sdss angular power spectrum : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a column vector whose component is all unity and @xmath85 is the total number of multipole bins .",
    "figure [ fig : inf ] plots @xmath82 for the cases of four photo - z slices .",
    "the errors are calculated from the 1000 times bootstrap resampling , and the dashed line represents the case of gaussian - fluctuations .",
    "we offset slightly the horizontal positions of the four symbols at each multipole bin to show the errors clearly .",
    "if there were a one - to - one map from the nonlinear to the linear regimes , then @xmath82 obtained from sdss catalogs would follow the dashed line .",
    "as can be seen , at low multipoles ( @xmath86 ) it matches the gaussian case pretty well . at higher multipole ( @xmath87 ) , however , we detect a clear signal of saturation in @xmath82 . note that at @xmath3 the observed amount of the cumulative information is two orders of magnitude lower than expected for the case of gaussian - fluctuations in all four photo - z slices .",
    "the amplitude of the saturated region of @xmath82 at high @xmath39 tends to increase as photo - z increases in the range of @xmath88 , which is consistent with the numerical results of rh05 .",
    "although the amplitude becomes lower at the highest photo - z slice ( @xmath89 ) , the differences are within the errors . unlike rh05",
    ", however , we could not find a sharp rise of @xmath82 at nonlinear scales even when we increase the number of pixels .",
    "it might be because in the nonlinear scale the light - to - matter bias becomes important and many other complicated baryonic processes might have destroyed the information content further .    )",
    "the dashed line represents the cumulative information in the linear angular power spectrum and the errors are calculated from 1000 times bootstrap - resampling.,width=307 ]",
    "it is worth mentioning here that what you have calculated using the sdss data is not rigorously the information about the amplitude of the power spectrum .",
    "but , it only approximates the information in the linear power spectrum to the extent that @xmath90 is near unity .",
    "our result provides an observational evidence for the previous theoretical clues that at translinear scale there is very little independent information in the matter power spectrum , consistent with light tracing matter till this scale @xcite .",
    "since the multipole scales where the information saturation is detected correspond to the weak lensing regime , this result has a direct impact on the weak lensing analyses .",
    "the loss of information in the angular power spectrum would lead to increasing non - gaussianity in sampling errors .",
    "unlike the usual assumption adopted in most weak lensing analyses that the non - gaussianity contribution to the sampling errors for the angular power spectrum is marginal ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , our result suggests that it should be quite substantial and thus the gaussian - noise description for the lensing power spectrum should not be valid .",
