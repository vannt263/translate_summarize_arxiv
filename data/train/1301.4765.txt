    "recently , bidirectional relay network attracts a lot of interest , because it has better spectral efficiency than conventional one - way relay network when adopting the network coding technique@xcite .",
    "in addition , the relay selection  ( rs ) technique has been intensively researched in the bidirectional relay network , due to its ability to achieve full diversity with a single relay@xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the symbol error rate  ( ser ) of bidirectional rs was derived in a closed - form , which verifies that rs can achieve full diversity .",
    "the ergodic capacity analysis of bidirectional rs was obtained in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , imperfect channel state information  ( csi ) , i.e. , outdated csi and imperfect channel estimation , has great impact on the performance of rs , which has been fully studied in one - way relay network , such as the ser analysis @xcite , and the ergodic capacity analysis @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of the authors knowledge , all the previous researches about bidirectional rs all assume the csi is perfect , and the impact of imperfect csi , such as outdated csi , on the performance of bidirectional rs has not been investigated .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the ergodic capacity of rs in bidirectional amplify - and - forward  ( af ) relay with imperfect csi . the system model and the imperfect csi model",
    "are presented in section . in section",
    ", we discuss the optimal rs scheme in maximizing the ergodic capacity .",
    "however , it can not be achieved practically , due to the imperfect csi .",
    "therefore , two suboptimal rs schemes are analyzed , in which the first scheme is based on the imperfect channel coefficients , and the second scheme is based on the predicted channel coefficients .",
    "the tight lower bound of the ergodic capacity for the suboptimal rs schemes is derived in section .",
    "it is noted that the analytical expression is provided under the generalized network structure , i.e. , the channel coefficients follow independent but not necessarily identical complex - gaussian fading , and the correlation coefficients of outdated csi are different for different channels . in section",
    ", monte - carlo simulations verify that the analytical expression matches tightly with the simulated results .",
    "the results reveal that the ergodic capacity of bidirectional rs degrades greatly once csi is imperfect , whereas the rs scheme based on the predicted channel can compensate the performance loss , and it approaches infinitely to the performance achieved by the optimal rs scheme , when the prediction length is sufficiently large .",

    "only the selected relay is used for transmission , and other relays keep idle until the next relay selection process comes . due to the time - variation of channel , the channel at the date transmission process @xmath16 is quite different from that at the relay selection process @xmath17 , and their relationship is modeled as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is an independent identically distributed rv with @xmath17 ; @xmath20 , where @xmath21 stands for the zeroth order bessel function@xcite , @xmath22 is the doppler spread , and @xmath23 is the time delay .",

    "we also observe that the ergodic capacity degrades once csi is outdated , e.g. , the performance loss between @xmath128 and @xmath127 is about @xmath129 db in high snr , and more severely outdated csi results in greater performance loss , although outdated csi has no impact on the multiplexing gain .    figs .  2 - 4 study the capacity of bidirectional af rs with outdated csi , when adopting the rs scheme and the variance of detection error @xmath130 .",

    "also , the line of @xmath136 means the csi is perfect , because @xmath137 when @xmath136 .",
    "as this figure reveals , the rs scheme based on channel prediction outperforms the scheme without channel prediction , and the performance gain gets larger when increasing the prediction length .",
    "the qualitative explanation of the phenomenon is that increasing the prediction length results in growing the correlation coefficient @xmath138 , thus the prediction becomes more accurate and the performance gets improved .",

    "as the figure reveals , the curves of capacity under different prediction lengths @xmath142 have almost the same performance in small @xmath126 , and all the capacity degrades as @xmath126 increases .",

    ". therefore , larger @xmath142 improves the robustness of capacity .",
    "4 investigates the impact of prediction length @xmath142 on the capacity .",
    "the y - axis is the normalized difference of capacity , i.e. , the difference between the capacity obtained by the rs scheme and the capacity obtained by the optimal rs scheme , normalized by the latter .",
    "smaller normalized difference means the capacity of the rs scheme with outdated csi has closer performance with the optimal performance .",
    "different lines of fig .",
    "4 are plotted under different @xmath126 and snr , and all the normalized differences decrease monotonously to zero as @xmath142 increases , which reveals that the rs scheme can infinitely approach to the optimal performance , by enlarging the prediction length .",

    "the impact of imperfect csi on the ergodic capacity of bidirectional af rs has been investigated in this paper .",
    "the tight lower bound of ergodic capacity is derived in a closed form and verified by simulations .",
    "the results reveal that imperfect csi will jeopardize the capacity of bidirectional rs network , whereas the rs based on the channel prediction can compensate the performance loss , and it can infinitely approach to the optimal performance , by enlarging the prediction length .",
