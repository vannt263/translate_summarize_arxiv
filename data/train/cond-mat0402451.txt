    "the last few years have seen a considerable increase in the research activity concerning diluted and disordered spin models .",
    "this recent interest is mainly driven by two very different , but technically closely related motivations .",
    "the first one aims at understanding common fundamental features of glassy systems , or more generally of out - of - equilibrium problems . besides various other approaches @xcite ,",
    "the study of disordered spin models has led to important insights and given rise to the use of general concepts like , e.g. , replica symmetry breaking on the static side @xcite , or effective temperatures on the dynamic one @xcite .",
    "most of these studies were performed on mean - field models , and the validity of these concepts for finite - dimensional systems is still under discussion . for spin models , mean - field has long been another name for fully - connected , i.e.  models where each degree of freedom interacts with each other .",
    "more recently , a lot of effort was invested in the study of diluted models @xcite .",
    "these are still mean - field like in the sense that they do not have an underlying geometric structure , and are thus analytically easier to treat than finite - dimensional problems . at the same time",
    ", they have finite connectivity : each degree of freedom interacts only with a finite number of neighbors , and the concept of a local environment is well - defined .",
    "this allows , e.g. , to introduce microscopically motivated interactions .",
    "diluted models can therefore be considered as an intermediate step between the fully - connected and the finite - dimensional case .",
    "a second major motivation for the study of diluted spin models arises from their close connection with a very interesting class of combinatorial optimization problems @xcite , including famous problems like satisfiability of boolean formulas and graph coloring for instance .",
    "these problems show phase transitions in the statistical properties of their solutions as well as in the dynamical behavior of algorithms @xcite , and have thus been extensively studied using tools and concepts originally devised for statistical mechanics purpose @xcite .    despite the large interest in diluted models ,",
    "many basic questions are still open . whereas the main technical obstacles in analyzing the static behavior are solved by now , and the equilibrium properties of these models are quite well - understood",
    ", the knowledge on the dynamical side @xcite is still relatively poor .",
    "here we reinvestigate some approximative methods recently introduced for analyzing the behavior of stochastic local search optimization algorithms @xcite .",
    "we apply and generalize these ideas to a purely physical model , in order to better understand the assumptions behind the approximations made , and to assess their quality .",
    "we concentrate on a very simple system , namely a ferromagnetic ising model defined on a diluted network of fixed connectivity , or bethe lattice .",
    "this example allows to easily present , test and understand approximate methods which should be useful to treat more interesting , glassy problems .",
    "in fact the non - equilibrium flavor of this work comes from the study of transient relaxation from an arbitrary initial configuration to thermal equilibrium , and not from the absence of thermal equilibrium as in the case of glassy systems , or from the lack of detailed balance as in previous investigations of algorithms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after this general introduction , the model and its equilibrium behavior are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dyn ] the dynamical rules of the model are presented , and a hierarchical approximation scheme is developed .",
    "the first three approximations are compared to numerical simulations in sec .",
    "[ sec : mc ] , and they are further exploited analytically to describe the critical behavior in sec .",
    "[ sec : critical ] .",
    "[ sec : twotime ] is dedicated to an extension of the previous approximations to the analysis of two - time quantities . in sec .",
    "[ sec : drt ] we unveil the relation of our approach to the dynamical replica theory proposed by coolen and sherrington @xcite .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in the last section , and possible future directions of research are presented .",
    "we consider a ferromagnetic ising model on a bethe lattice , given by its hamiltonian @xmath0 depending on the microscopic configuration @xmath1 of the @xmath2 ising variables @xmath3 . the couplings @xmath4 take the value @xmath5 whenever two spin @xmath6 and @xmath7 are connected , and zero otherwise . compared to the usual form we have shifted the hamiltonian by its ground state value , and divided it by two . in this way",
    ", the hamiltonian simply counts the _ number of unsatisfied edges _ ,",
    "i.e. the number of edges carrying anti - parallel spins on their extremities .",
    "it can thus be rewritten as @xmath8 the reason why we choose this slightly modified form will become clear below , it allows a simpler presentation of the dynamical equations .",
    "as already said above , we consider this ising model on a bethe lattice . in accordance with the recent use in statistical mechanics @xcite",
    ", we define these as random regular graphs , i.e.  all vertices have the same degree ( number of neighboring sites ) @xcite .",
    "these graphs are locally tree - like .",
    "in contrast to cayley trees they have _ no boundary _ , all vertices have exactly @xmath9 neighbors and are thus equivalent .",
    "the graph therefore contains loops for any @xmath10 .",
    "these are , however , of length @xmath11 , i.e. they become long in the thermodynamic limit @xmath12 ( with @xmath9 kept constant ) .",
    "note that the randomness of these graphs appears only through these loops . on finite length scales they appear homogeneous due to their constant vertex degree .    before investigating the non - equilibrium dynamics of this model , we shortly review its static behavior which can be easily solved using the bethe - peierls iterative approach @xcite .",
    "for doing so , we assume for a moment that our model is defined on a tree , the long loops will be taken into account later as self - consistency conditions .",
    "consider a given bond @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "let us denote @xmath15 the partition function of the subtree rooted in @xmath16 , with @xmath13 deleted , and with a fixed value of spin @xmath6 .",
    "these partition functions can be easily computed iteratively , @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the inverse temperature . defining the cavity field @xmath19 we obtain the iterative equations @xmath20 at this point , we take into account the fact that the model is not defined on a tree , but that all vertices have the same vertex degree and are thus equivalent .",
    "we are therefore looking for a self - consistent _ homogeneous _ solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fielditeration ] ) with @xmath21 for all bonds @xmath13 , @xmath22 this equation has the obvious paramagnetic solution @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , at high temperature this solution is the only one .",
    "there appears , however , a ferromagnetic phase transition at the critical inverse temperature @xmath24 . for lower temperatures ,",
    "the trivial solution is thermodynamically unstable , and two equivalent ferromagnetic solutions @xmath25 describe the equilibrium behavior of the model .    here and in the following , without any loss of generality",
    ", we concentrate only on non - negative @xmath26 .",
    "once its value is known , we can immediately compute the bethe free - energy density ( total free - energy divided by @xmath2 ) , @xmath27 other interesting observables are the energy density @xmath28 which equals @xmath29 in the paramagnetic phase , and the magnetization @xmath30 which becomes positive for positive cavity fields @xmath26 .",
    "note that the magnetization @xmath31 depends on the cavity field @xmath26 via the `` true '' effective field @xmath32 which incorporates the contributions of all @xmath9 neighbors of a spin , cf .",
    "( [ eq : fielditeration],[eq : field ] ) .    to explain some steps of the dynamical approach",
    ", we also need the probability @xmath33 that a randomly selected vertex has spin value @xmath34 and belongs to exactly @xmath35 unsatisfied edges , i.e. @xmath35 out of his @xmath9 neighbors have spin @xmath36 .",
    "this quantity is given at equilibrium by @xmath37 with @xmath38 being a normalization constant enforcing @xmath39 .",
    "this can be rewritten in terms of the energy density and the magnetization as @xmath40 similar expressions can be easily derived for the probability @xmath41 that a randomly selected edge has a first ( resp .",
    "second ) end vertex of spin @xmath42 ( resp .",
    "@xmath43 ) , and this vertex belongs to @xmath44 ( resp .",
    "@xmath45 ) unsatisfied edges , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is again determined by normalization .",
    "we will study the following local stochastic dynamics of the model : in each algorithmic step @xmath48 , a site @xmath16 is chosen at random , @xmath49 .",
    "this site is characterized by its spin @xmath6 and the number @xmath50 of its unsatisfied incident edges .",
    "the spin is flipped to @xmath51 with probability @xmath52 .",
    "we denote the new configuration , with spin @xmath6 flipped , by @xmath53 .",
    "obviously all edges incident to site @xmath16 which were unsatisfied become satisfied , and vice versa .",
    "hence the variation of the energy if the spin is flipped equals @xmath54 . in order to reach thermal equilibrium at inverse temperature @xmath18 in the long - time limit",
    ", we impose the detailed balance condition under the form @xmath55 the two best - known possibilities falling in this category are the metropolis rate , @xmath56 and the glauber rate , @xmath57 we will keep , however , a general form for @xmath58 in our analytical treatment , only assuming eq . ( [ eq : detailed_balance ] ) to be valid . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", this discrete process acquires a continuous form by defining the time as @xmath59 , and stepwise differences of extensive observables translate into time derivatives of the corresponding observable densities ( extensive observables divided by @xmath2 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the system , or more precisely of the probabilities @xmath60 that a microscopic configuration @xmath61 is found at time @xmath62 , can be completely described by the master equation @xmath63\\ .\\ ] ] it is , however , far too complicated to solve these @xmath64 coupled equations directly .",
    "we are therefore going to present several approximative characterizations of the dynamics of the model .",
    "they all rely on the same idea : instead of following the evolution of the full distribution @xmath60 of microscopic configurations , we turn to a simplified description , in terms of a finite number of macroscopic observables .",
    "the dynamic evolution of these can not be expected to be closed , as we have lost information with respect to the microscopic description .",
    "it depends in general on a larger number of macroscopic variables , i.e.  a hierarchical set of dynamic evolution equations arises .",
    "choosing carefully a closure hypothesis at any level of this hierarchy , we are led to improvingly precise predictions .    in the next three subsections",
    "the first three levels of this hierarchy are presented , together with the corresponding closure assumptions .",
    "the evaluation of their accuracy is deferred until sec .",
    "[ sec : mc ] , where we compare them with numerical simulations .      the simplest implementation of this idea consists in keeping track of the energy density @xmath65 and of the magnetization per spin @xmath66 only .",
    "it is rather natural to include the energy in our set of observables .",
    "indeed , the system is evolving towards equilibrium with respect to the gibbs measure , in other words , at long times all the microscopic configurations with equilibrium energy are equiprobable . including the magnetization is also necessary for a ferromagnetic system , where the low temperature phase is characterized by a non zero value of the magnetization . in a more general setting , the minimal set of observables",
    "is given by the energy of the system and a complete set of order parameters which allow for the exact description of the equilibrium distribution .",
    "at each time - step , the chosen spin has value @xmath34 and @xmath35 unsatisfied edges around it with a certain probability @xmath67 .",
    "if the flip is accepted , i.e. with probability @xmath68 , the total energy changes by an amount of @xmath69 ( unsatisfied edges become satisfied , and _",
    "vice versa _ ) , and the variation of the total magnetization is @xmath70 .",
    "we thus obtain in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath71\\ ,   \\label{eq : binomial_e } \\\\",
    "\\frac{dm}{dt } & = & 2 \\sum_{u=0}^k w(u,\\beta ) [ p_{-}(u;t ) - p_{+}(u;t ) ] \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : binomial_m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although exact , these equations are not of direct use because they involve @xmath67 , a dynamical quantity not present in our original description via @xmath72 .",
    "we thus have to express approximately @xmath67 in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath31 in order to close the set of equations .",
    "the randomly selected variable has spin @xmath34 with probability @xmath74 . in the absence of further informations",
    ", we can only assume that each of the @xmath9 incident edges is unsatisfied with the same probability @xmath75 .",
    "this yields the approximate binomial expression @xmath76 @xmath77 can be determined by the following consistency condition .",
    "all unsatisfied edges connect anti - parallel spins .",
    "the energy must then be the same if expressed as the number of @xmath78 spins around @xmath79 spins , or the other way around .",
    "@xmath80 we finally obtain @xmath81 this expression has the same form as the equilibrium equation ( [ eq : p_sigma_u2 ] ) , but with @xmath65 and @xmath66 being dynamical variables , which can differ from their equilibrium values",

    "the second assumption , on the other hand , is much more crucial : it is obviously true in thermal equilibrium if the energy density is included in @xmath206 .",
    "indeed the probability distribution of microscopic configurations is then given by the boltzmann - gibbs distribution , i.e. it depends on the actual configuration only via one observable , the energy .",
    "there is , however , no reason why this should hold far from equilibrium . in fact , as discussed before , we have observed that the inclusion of more and more sophisticated observables gives a better and better description of the dynamics of the system .    at variance with the original drt , where replicas are introduced to average over the disorder of the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite , we are going to use the cavity method @xcite .",
    "the latter is more efficient to average over the quenched disorder of diluted systems , in our case represented by the random regular graph on which the ising model is defined .",

    "let us start the discussion with the binomial approximation , i.e. with the case where the dynamics is completely approximated by the behavior of the energy and the magnetization densities .",
    "the two assumptions of drt stated above result in the following approximation , @xmath208 instead of working directly in this generalized micro - canonical framework , we use a generalized canonical approach introducing conjugate parameters for the energy , i.e. a formal inverse temperature @xmath209 , and for the magnetization , i.e. a formal external field @xmath210 .",

    "( [ eq : binomial_p ] ) holds , i.e. that the two assumptions of drt lead to the same closure of our approximate dynamical equations .",
