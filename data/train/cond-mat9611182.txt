    "the dynamic response of the ising systems has recently been studied extensively employing computer simulations [ 1 ] . in particular , the study of dynamical response of ising systems to oscillating magnetic field [ 2,3 ] has led to many intriguing dynamic phenomena , like dynamic hysteresis and the fluctuation induced dynamic symmetry breaking transitions in ( low e.g. , one , two or three dimensional ) ising system in presence of an oscillating field . acharyya and chakrabarti also noted [ 3,4 ] some anomalous behaviour in the growth of pulse susceptibility , in ising systems under pulsed magnetic fields of finite durations .    usually , when a cooperatively interacting thermodynamic system in equilibrium is perturbed ( with the perturbation having a step function like variation with time ) , then the relaxation of the system ( to the equilibrium appropiate to the perturbed state ) is observed to follow the common debye type form with a single relaxation time .",
    "the standard ( debye ) form for any response function ( say magnetisation of ising system ) @xmath11 is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the relaxation time , @xmath14 denotes the new equilibrium value , @xmath15 is a constant .",
    "as the critical temperature is approached @xmath13 shows a critical slowing down ; @xmath13 diverges at the critical temperature @xmath2 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the correlation length , @xmath18 is the dynamic exponent and @xmath19 is the correlation length exponent [ 1 ] .    here",
    ", we have investigated in details the response of pure ising systems to pulsed magnetic fields of finite duration , using monte carlo simulations for two dimensional ising systems , and solving numerically the meanfield equation of motion .",
    "we have studied the response behaviour for positive pulses , where the pulsed field is in the direction of the sponteneous magnetisation in the ordered phase . in the disordered phase , of course , this notion is immaterial .",
    "one can also study the effect of negative pulses on the sponteneous order , where the field direction is opposite to sponteneous magnetisation .",
    "although many intriguing features of the domain growth etc are expected for such negative pulse problem , we confine here to the study of positive pulses only .",
    "we have measured the ratio @xmath0 of the response magnetisation ( pulse ) half - width ( @xmath20 ) to that ( @xmath5 ) of the pulsed external field , and the ratio @xmath1 of the response magnetisation peak height ( @xmath21 ) to the field pulse height ( @xmath22 ) giving the pulse susceptibility .",
    "the temperature variation of these two quantities for various pulse width durations and heights of the external field , have been investigated .",
    "we find that for weak pulses , while the width - ratio @xmath0 diverges at the order - disorder transition point @xmath2 of the unperturbed ising system , the pulse susceptibility @xmath1 does not diverge and for low dimensions , e.g. , in two dimension studied here , a smeared peak in @xmath1 occurs at an effective @xmath4 , which approaches @xmath2 as the field pulse width @xmath5 increases ( @xmath1 diverges at @xmath2 as @xmath23 ) . a meanfield analysis for the absence of divergence of @xmath1 for finite @xmath5 has been developed .",
    "also , a finite time scaling analysis , similar to fisher s finite size ( length ) scaling [ 5 ] , has been developed and compared with the observation of the effective transition temperature @xmath4 with the external field pulse width @xmath5 .",
    "we have organised this paper as follows : in section ii , the model and the simulation techniques have been described . in section iii ,",
    "the results are given .",
    "the paper ends with concluding remarks in section iv .",
    "a ferromagnetically interacting ( nearest neighbour ) ising system in presence of a time dependent magnetic field can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 s are spin variable having their value @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the time varying longitudinal magnetic field . here",
    ", we have considered the time variation of @xmath27 as follows : @xmath28 where @xmath22 is the amplitude of the field and @xmath5 is the duration or the active period of the external field .    in our simulation , we have considered a 500@xmath29500 square lattice in two dimension . at each site of the lattice there is a spin variable @xmath25 = ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we update the lattice by stepping sequentially over it following the glauber single spin flip dynamics .",
    "one such full scan over the lattice is unit time step ( monte carlo step or mcs ) here .",
    "first , we allowed the system to reach the equilibrium ( at any temperature @xmath30 ) and only after that the magnetic field @xmath27 has been switched on ( @xmath31 is thus much larger than the relaxation time of the system ) .",
    "one can also use random updating sequences .",
    "however , it takes more time ( mcs ) to stabilise the system .",
    "we expect all the features of the response studied here remains qualitatively unchanged for random updating sequences , and we give the results here for sequential updating only . we have measured the maximum height ( above the equilibrium value ) @xmath21 and half - width @xmath20 of the response magnetisation . here , as mentioned before , the following two quantities have been defined to characterise the response of the system : @xmath32 and @xmath33 it may be noted that @xmath1 reduces to normal static susceptibility as @xmath34 and @xmath23 . at each temperature for",
    "fixed @xmath22 and @xmath5 , the numerical values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are obtained averaging over 20 random monte carlo realisations ( initial seed ) .",
    "we have studied the temperature variation of these two quantities .",
    "the results are given and discussed in the next section .",
    "the observation for finite peak in @xmath1 at an effective transition temperature @xmath35 is analysed in view of finite time scaling behaviour , as mentioned before .",
    "to study the similar response in the case where the fluctuations are absent , we have considered the following meanfield dynamical equation of motion for the kinetic ising system : @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the microscopic relaxation time , @xmath38 is the average magnetisation ( in the meanfield approximation ) , @xmath27 is the time varying pulse field having the same time variation described in equation [ ham ] and @xmath30 denotes the temperature .",
    "we have solved numerically the above equations using fourth order runge - kutta method .",
    "we have evaluated the pulse width ratio @xmath0 and pulse susceptibility @xmath1 at various temperatures for fixed pulse width @xmath5 and height @xmath22 .",
    "the numerical results are given in the next section , where we have compared the results for finite peak height in @xmath1 ( at @xmath2 = 1 ) , with an approximate analytic estimate of @xmath1 in such cases .",
    "as mentioned before , our results here are for two dimensional ising system on square lattice of size 500@xmath29500 .",
    "we applied an external field of amplitude @xmath22 for a duration @xmath5 after bringing the system into a steady state .",
    "for this , the typical number of monte carlo steps required for this size of the lattice chosen here , is observed to be of the order of @xmath39 .",
    "the response magnetisation has amplitude @xmath21 ( measured from the equilibrium value ) and a half - width @xmath20 .",
    "1 shows a typical time variation of magnetic field @xmath27 and the corresponding response magnetisation @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamical response is characterised by two quantities ; the width - ratio @xmath0 and the pulse - susceptibility @xmath1 .",
    "the temperature variation of these two quantities has been studied .",
    "2 shows the temperature variations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for fixed values of @xmath40 and for three values of @xmath41 mcs ) .",
    "since @xmath21 is bounded from above , a large @xmath22 would saturate @xmath21 and hence @xmath1 becomes small ( due to the saturation ) .",
    "also , for extremely small @xmath22 , it becomes difficult to identify @xmath21 from the noise , and hence the estimate of @xmath1 becomes erroneous .",
    "we found @xmath42 to be well within the above optimal range . from the figure it is clear that @xmath0 has a sharp divergence at @xmath43 , the onsager transition temperature , due to the small size of the system ) almost irrespective of the values of the pulse width @xmath5 .",
    "but @xmath1 shows peak at different points ( significantly above @xmath44 ) depending upon the values of the field pulse width @xmath5 . as @xmath5 value increases",
    ", it is observed that the peak shifts towards @xmath2 from above ( and also the peak height grows ) .",
    "let us try to understand why the width - ratio @xmath0 diverges at @xmath2 , while height - ratio or pulse susceptibility @xmath1 shows peak at some higher value @xmath45 depending upon the value of @xmath5 : @xmath46 as @xmath23 .",
    "the pulse - like perturbation probes the response of the system at finite frequencies .",
    "consequently , the @xmath47 can not diverge as the response magnetisation height @xmath21 is not an equilibrium value corresponding to the pulse height @xmath22 ; rather the @xmath21 results are bounded by the time window of width @xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", the response will take its own relaxation time to come to its equilibrium value ( irrespective of the value of @xmath5 ) , when the field is switched off ( at @xmath48 ) .",
    "this leads to the divergence of @xmath20 , due to critical slowing down , as @xmath30 approaches @xmath2 .",
    "the sharp divergence of width - ratio @xmath0 is identified as the consequence of critical slowing down and the point of divergence is the critical temperature @xmath2 for the ferro - para transition .",
    "in fact , since the relaxation after the withdrawal of the pulse is unrestricted by the pulse - width , we can assume that @xmath49 .",
    "we therefore plot in fig .",
    "3 , @xmath50 versus @xmath30 and find a straight line plot with @xmath3 in two dimensional case .",
    "this compares well with the previous estimates of the value of @xmath51 [ 6 ] .",
    "as the growth of the height of magnetisation response ( and its maximum value @xmath21 ) is very much bounded by the time window @xmath5 of the applied field pulse , the anomalous behaviour of @xmath1 ( having finite peak at a shifted temperature @xmath45 ) may be considered to be due to the finite size ( in time ) effect .",
    "similar to the finite size ( in length ) scaling theory of fisher [ 5 ] , where a finite size system shows effective ( non - singular or non - divergent ) pseudo - critical behaviour at @xmath52 when the correlation length @xmath17 becomes of the order of the system size @xmath53 , we suggest a finite time @xmath54 scaling behaviour here for @xmath1 : if the relaxation time @xmath55 , where @xmath19 is the correlation length exponent and @xmath18 is the dynamic exponent , then @xmath1 would show peak at the temperature @xmath4 here when @xmath56 or @xmath57 , or @xmath58    where @xmath59 is some constant .",
    "in fact , fig .",
    "4 shows that the effective peak position @xmath4 indeed approaches @xmath2 as @xmath23 .",
    "the inset shows the plot of @xmath4 with @xmath60 , which gives a straight line for @xmath7 .",
    "this again suggests @xmath3 and also the extrapolated value of @xmath2 becomes about 2.29 , which compares well with the onsager value , comparable to the previous estimate .",
    "we have solved the meanfield equation for response magnetisation [ mfe ] using fourth order runge - kutta method .",
    "1 shows the typical variation of response magnetisation and field . here",
    "also we have measured the width - ratio and the pulse susceptibility and studied the temperature variation of these two quantities .",
    "fig.5 shows the temperature variation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for different values of @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath0 diverges and @xmath1 peaks at the same order - disorder transition point ( @xmath61 here ) .",
    "we have also studied the variation of the maximum value of @xmath1 ( @xmath62 at @xmath63 ) with respect to the duration of the pulsed field .",
    "it may also be mentioned that the peak height was found to increase with increasing pulse width @xmath5 , and @xmath1 diverges as @xmath23 : @xmath64 fig .",
    "6 shows the variation of @xmath65 with @xmath5 .    in order to comprehend these observations , we solve the equation [ mfe ] in a linearised limit ( large @xmath30 and small @xmath22 ; specifically @xmath66 , @xmath34 ) . in such limit ,",
    "the equation of motion becomes @xmath67 one can solve the above equation using a form @xmath68 which gives @xmath69 giving @xmath70 , and    @xmath71    integrating the last equation for @xmath72 for a finite time width @xmath5 and @xmath73 elsewhere , one gets @xmath74 at @xmath75 .",
    "this gives    @xmath76    we have checked the above linear relationship of @xmath62 with @xmath5 for extremely small values of pulse field amplitude @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "we have studied the glauber ( order parameter nonconserving ) dynamics of an ising system under a time varying external magnetic field , when the field is applied as a pulse of finite time width , after the system reaches the equilibrium .",
    "the time variation of the response magnetisation is studied as a function of pulse width @xmath5 , height @xmath22 and temperature @xmath30 of the system .",
    "we have measured specifically @xmath77 and @xmath78 , where @xmath20 is the time width of the response magnetisation and @xmath21 is the maximum height of the response magnetisation above its equilibrium value .",
    "our computer simulation results for square lattice showed @xmath79 with @xmath80 , the onsagar value , and @xmath1 has a peak @xmath62 at @xmath81 , such that a finite size ( in time ) scaling behaviour is observed : @xmath82 , with @xmath3 .",
