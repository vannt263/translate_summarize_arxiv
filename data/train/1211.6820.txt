    "mean - variance hedging is one of the classical problems from mathematical finance . in financial terms , its goal is to minimize the mean squared error between a given payoff @xmath0 and the final wealth of a self - financing strategy @xmath1 trading in the underlying assets @xmath2 .",
    "mathematically , one wants to project the random variable @xmath0 in @xmath3 on the space of all stochastic integrals @xmath4 , perhaps after subtracting an initial capital  @xmath5 .",
    "the contribution of our paper is to solve this problem via stochastic control methods and stochastic calculus techniques for the case where the asset prices @xmath2 are given by a general ( locally @xmath6-square - integrable ) semimartingale , under a natural no - arbitrage assumption .",
    "the literature on mean - variance hedging is vast , and we do not try to survey it here ; see @xcite for an attempt in that direction .",
    "there are two main approaches ; one of them uses martingale theory and projection arguments , while the other views the task as a linear - quadratic stochastic control problem and uses backward stochastic differential equations ( bsdes ) to describe the solution . by combining tools from both areas ,",
    "we improve earlier work in two directions  we describe the solution more explicitly than by the martingale and projection method , and we work in a general semimartingale model without restricting ourselves to particular setups ( like it processes or lvy settings ) .",
    "we show that the value process of the stochastic control problem associated to mean - variance hedging possesses a quadratic structure , describe its three coefficient processes by semimartingale bsdes and show how to obtain the optimal strategy @xmath7 from there .",
    "in contrast to the majority of earlier contributions from the control strand of the literature , we also give a rigorous derivation of these bsdes . for comparison ,",
    "the usual results ( especially in settings with it processes or jump - diffusions ) start from a bsde system and only prove a verification theorem that shows how a solution to the bsde system induces an optimal strategy . apart from being more precise , we think that our approach is also more informative since it shows clearly and explicitly how the bsdes arise , and hence provides a systematic way to tackle mean - variance hedging via stochastic control in general semimartingale models .",
    "more detailed comparisons to the literature are given in the respective sections .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "we start in section  [ sec1 ] with a precise problem formulation and state the martingale optimality principle for the value process @xmath8 of the associated stochastic control problem . assuming that each ( time @xmath9 ) conditional problem admits an optimal strategy ,",
    "we then show that @xmath8 is a quadratic polynomial in @xmath5 whose coefficients are stochastic processes @xmath10 that do not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "this is a kind of folklore result , and our only claim to originality is that we give a very simple proof in a very general setting .",
    "we also show that the coefficient @xmath11 equals the value process @xmath12 for the control problem with initial value @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    ".    motivated by the last result , we study in section  [ sec2 ] the particular problem for and @xmath14 .",
    "we impose the no - arbitrage condition that there exists an equivalent @xmath15-martingale measure for @xmath2 with @xmath6-square - integrable density and are then able to characterize the process @xmath11 as the solution of a semimartingale bsde .",
    "more precisely , theorem  [ theorem2.4 ] shows that all conditional problems for @xmath16 admit optimal strategies if and only if that bsde ( [ equ2.18 ] ) has a solution in a specific class , and in that case , the unique solution is @xmath11 and the conditionally optimal strategies can be given in terms of the solution to ( [ equ2.18 ] ) . in comparison to earlier work",
    ", we eliminate all technical assumptions ( like continuity or quasi - left - continuity ) on @xmath2 , and we also do not need reverse hlder inequalities for our main results .    section  [ sec3 ] considers the general case of the mean - variance hedging problem with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the analog of theorem  [ theorem2.4 ] is given in theorem  [ theorem3.1 ] , where we describe the three coefficient processes @xmath19 by a coupled system ( [ equ3.1])([equ3.3 ] ) of semimartingale bsdes .",
    "existence of optimal strategies for all conditional problems for @xmath20 is shown to be equivalent to solvability of the system ( [ equ3.1])([equ3.3 ] ) , with solution @xmath19 , and we again express the conditionally optimal strategies in terms of the solution to ( [ equ3.1])([equ3.3 ] ) . as mentioned above , this is stronger than only a verification result .    in section  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we provide equivalent alternative versions for our bsdes which are more convenient to work with in some examples with jumps .",
    "this also allows us to discuss in more detail the connections to the existing literature .",
    "finally , section  [ sec5 ] illustrates the use of our results and gives further links to the literature by a number of simple examples .",
    "we start with a finite time horizon @xmath21 and a filtered probability space @xmath22 with the filtration @xmath23 satisfying the usual conditions of right - continuity and .",
    "let @xmath24 be an @xmath25-valued rcll semimartingale , and denote by @xmath26 the space of all predictable @xmath2-integrable processes @xmath1 , @xmath27 for short , such that the stochastic integral process @xmath28 is in the space @xmath29 of semimartingales .",
