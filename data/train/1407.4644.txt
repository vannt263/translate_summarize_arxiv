    "see appendix a.    the formation of a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) leads to more rapid equilibration and to critical fluctuations .",
    "these also facilitate the equilibration of rotation especially in low viscosity fluid dynamical models like picr with khi . before the final hadronization",
    "the perturbative vacuum may keep the participant system more compact and then rapid hadronization from a supercooled qgp has the best chances to show observable signs of rotation at the final freeze out . to detect the observable signs of global collective flow patterns these",
