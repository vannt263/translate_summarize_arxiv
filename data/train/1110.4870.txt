    "the space experiment tus is going to be launched in the near future for studying ultrahigh  energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs)@xcite .",
    "its main purpose is to search for uhecrs particles over the whole celestial sphere by recording the fluorescence that is generated in developing of extensive air showers ( eass ) .",
    "this radiation is isotropic , which allows some photons to reach the satellite  based detector .",
    "in addition , development of uhe showers is accompanied by the intensive flux of cherenkov radiation , propagating mainly along the shower axis .",
    "nevertheless , when an eas passes over a high  albedo surface the cherenkov radiation can be detected at high altitudes .",
    "an example of this is the balloon experiment @xcite for recording cherenkov photons scattered from snow  covered surfaces . according to @xcite ,",
    "the total signal of the cherenkov radiation gives an exact estimate of the primary energy , and its spatial distribution enables to measure the shower maximum depth and therefore to estimate the mass of the primary particle .    in the case of the satellite  based detector ,",
    "recording cherenkov photons reflected from the ocean surface is of great interest as their flash at the end of the fluorescence track would allow one to determine the shower trajectory more precisely . besides",
    ", cherenkov photons scattered in the atmosphere produce an additional background .",
    "calculations show that they will be superimposed on the fluorescence signal and blur its maximum .",
    "thus dependence of the `` noise '' on the shower parameters should be found and subtracted from the total signal .",
    "estimates of different components of the cherenkov light , which arise in developing of showers over the ocean , are presented in @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a computing technique for propagating eas ",
    "produced cherenkov photons in air and water .",
    "it was used in @xcite for estimating the ability of the tus detector to record the reflected component of the cherenkov light .",
    "these calculations may also be useful for experimental data processing and for constructing next  generation detectors ( see , for instance , the jem - euso project@xcite ) .",
    "the photon propagation task can be conventionally divided into two parts : 1 ) generation of the photons by electrons of the shower and 2 ) their subsequent travel in a medium .",
    "we apply the monte ",
    "carlo method in both cases , with the destiny of a large number of photons ( henceforth , just a photon ) simultaneously predicted .",
    "each photon is assigned by a certain weight , i.e. the number of photons  survived \" at a given calculation stage with respect to the maximum possible number of photons at the point of their generation .",
    "we use the laboratory reference system ( lrs ) in which the origin @xmath0 is located at the intersection point of the shower axis with the plane @xmath1 coinciding with the flat ocean surface , and @xmath2axis is directed to the top of the atmosphere .",
    "the lrs and systems to be introduced below are right  handed .",
    "first we follow the `` scheme of photon generation '' ( section [ sect_gener ] ) , where the energy and direction of the parent electron , the generation depth , direction and weight of the photon are defined .",
    "thus we obtain characteristics of the photon at the generation point , which are further used as input parameters in simulating its travel .",
    "the `` scheme of photon propagation in a medium '' ( section [ sect_prop ] ) presents a sequence of scattering events in which we define the path length of the photon to the next scattering point , its direction and weight .",
    "calculations continue until the photon reaches a given level ( for instance , the height of the satellite ) or its weight becomes less than a certain preset value .",
    "reflection and refraction of the photons at the `` air  water '' interface are considered with allowance for waves on the ocean surface ( section [ sect_waves ] ) .",
    "when an eas develops over the ocean surface cherenkov radiation is generated not only in air . some part of the cascade , depending on depth of the primary interaction as well as energy and direction of the shower , penetrates into water and also produces cherenkov photons .",
    "therefore we consider two media : air and water .",
    "the discussion below will require direction cosines of the shower in the lrs defined in section [ calc_tech ] : @xmath3 where the zenith @xmath4 and azimuth @xmath5 angles are input parameters .",
    "sought characteristics of a photon , namely its coordinates , direction cosines and weight , will be primed .",
    "we assume that the photon is produced along the shower axis , consequently coordinates of its generation point can be calculated from @xmath6 here , @xmath7 cm is the standart atmosphere height , @xmath8 g/@xmath9 is the ocean level depth , @xmath10g/@xmath11 is the water density .",
    "the depth @xmath12 of the photon generation point is simulated from the gaisser ",
    "hillas formula ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) @xmath13^{x_\\mathrm{max}/\\lambda}\\exp\\bigl[(x_\\mathrm{max}-x)/\\lambda\\bigr]\\ ] ] with parameters describing the average cascade curve of a shower with primary energy @xmath14ev : @xmath15 , @xmath16g/@xmath9 , @xmath17g/@xmath9 .    for finding the photon direction in the lrs , it is convenient to introduce local reference systems associated with the shower axis ( the reference system of the shower , rss ) and with the parent electron ( the reference system of the electron , rse ) . in the rss the @xmath2axis",
    "is steered along the shower axis and angles @xmath18 and @xmath19 characterize the direction of the electron , which , in turn , coincides with the @xmath2axis of the rse .",
    "the direction of the cherenkov photon in the rse is described by angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then its direction cosines @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the lrs are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26^{-1/2}$ ] ( @xmath27 ) and direction cosines of the electron and the photon are defined by standart formulae : @xmath28    in calculations we distinguish between `` forward  current '' ( @xmath29 ) and `` back  current '' ( @xmath30 ) electrons , with the latter taken into account only in generating in water .",
    "zenith angles of the back  current electrons are distributed isotropically , while that of the forward ",
    "current electrons are simulated from the appropriate distribution suggested in@xcite .",
    "azimuth angles of electrons of both types are uniformly distributed .    for photons ,",
    "azimuth angles obey the uniform distribution and zenith angles are given by the tamm ",
    "frank formula as a function of the electron energy @xmath31 : @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the threshold generation energy of cherenkov photons by an electron in a medium with refractive index @xmath34 . to determine the energy of the forward ",
    "current electrons we use the suitable distribution from@xcite .",
    "the energy of the back  current electrons is found from the distribution @xmath35^{-1.7},\\ ] ] which was specially derived by means of the geant4 code@xcite ( the calculations were performed with a lower value of @xmath36 ) .",
    "the number @xmath37 of the back  current electrons with energies @xmath38 is @xmath39% of  their total number @xmath40 .    finally , the photon is assigned an initial value of its weight . according to the tamm ",
    "frank theory , the number of photons with wavelength @xmath41 , @xmath42 , produced per unit depth , depends on the energy @xmath31 and depth @xmath12 of the parent electron and is given by @xmath43 therefore the number of the photons in a `` packet '' , the fate of which is simulated , varies from one iteration to another .",
    "we assume here that the unit ",
    "weight photon is generated by an electron with infinite energy at the ocean level .",
    "then the weight at any generation point can be defined as @xmath44 ^ 2\\!.\\ ] ] we note that a value of @xmath45 , averaged over a large number of events simulated , allows us to determine the total number of cherenkov photons generated by electrons of an eas quite easily ( see app . [ app1 ] ) .",
    "thus , applying this scheme , we are able to specify the coordinates @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , direction cosines @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and weight @xmath45 of a photon at its generation point , which are used further as input parameters in simulating its propagation in a medium .",
    "the brightest lines of fluorescent radiation in the atmosphere lie in the wavelength range @xmath49 nm . so the tus detector is assumed to be sensitive to photons with these wavelengths and we , in turn , restrict our calculations within this range .",
    "the process of photon propagation in a medium is usually represented as a sequence of scattering events , in which the coordinates of a new scattering point and direction of the photon are defined .",
    "we consider scattering in water and air separately because of differences in their physical properties .",
    "the input parameters are the coordinates , direction cosines and weight of the photon .",
    "in simulating the photon travel we take scattering and absorption processes into account . the corresponding free path lengths",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 are given in@xcite .",
    "the density and refractive index of water are assumed to be constant : @xmath10g/@xmath11 and @xmath52 .",
    "let us consider how a single scattering event is simulated .",
    "first , we calculate coordinates of the scattering point : @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) . here , @xmath55 is the photon path length between successive scattering events , which , in the case of a medium with constant density , has the exponential distribution : @xmath56 the weight of the photon is attenuated due to absorption on the path @xmath55 : @xmath57",
    ". then we compute new direction cosines of the photon in the lrs : @xmath58 where @xmath59^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "the angles @xmath60 and @xmath61 characterize deflection of the photon from its initial direction .",
    "@xmath61 is uniformly distributed and @xmath60 is simulated from the heneye ",
    "greenstein distribution ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) : @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "further the next scattering event is simulated .",
    "the procedure continues if the condition @xmath64 holds or until the photon reaches the ocean surface .",
    "travelling of a photon in air is considered disregarding its `` true '' absorption .",
    "this assumption is quite acceptable in the wavelength range of photons under study here . besides",
    ", we limit to rayleigh scattering by presuming the absence of clouds , aerosols , etc .",
    "the atmosphere is supposed to be isothermal .",
    "the coordinates , direction and weight of the photon are determined in the same way as for water .",
    "however the atmosphere is nonhomogeneous , which prohibits application of for simulating the path length to the next scattering point . nonetheless , within the assumptions indicated , the vertical depth @xmath65 traversed by the photon has the following simple exponential distribution ( see app .",
    "[ app2 ] ) : @xmath66 hence we can find the vertical depth @xmath67 and coordinate @xmath68 of the scattering point : @xmath69 where @xmath70g/@xmath9 is the vertical depth at the sea level .",
    "the photon escapes the atmosphere boundary when @xmath71 and reaches the sea level when @xmath72g/@xmath9 . in their turn ,",
    "the path length and other coordinates of the scattering point are calculated as @xmath73    the direction cosines of the photon in the lrs are determined from , with @xmath61 distributed uniformly and @xmath60 simulated from @xmath74    a new value of the photon weight is calculated with allowance for its attenuation due to scattering on the traversed path : @xmath75}\\quad\\text{for}\\;\\;\\mu'_z<0,\\\\ p&=0\\quad\\text{for}\\;\\;\\mu'_z\\approx0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the weight does not change if the photon leaves the atmosphere boundary or reaches the ocean surface .",
    "this method of weight calculation makes it possible to `` select '' photons with low number of scattering events .",
    "further we simulate the next scattering event .",
    "the procedure continues if the condition @xmath64 is true or until the photon reaches a required level .",
    "we deal with two models of wavy ocean surface : with periodic structure ( ps ) and with chaotic structure ( cs ) . in the first model",
    "the surface is represented in the lrs by a motionless wave with length @xmath76 and amplitude @xmath77 along the @xmath78axis .",
    "the shape of the wave is described by the parametric equations of a truncated cycloid : @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 , without dependence on the @xmath82coordinate . in the second model",
    "the ocean surface is divided into many small flat cells with height @xmath83 .",
    "the quantities @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( the subscripts @xmath86 and @xmath87 indicate the upwind and crosswind directions of the wave ) follow the two - dimensional normal distribution @xcite @xmath88\\!,\\ ] ] with variances @xmath89 , @xmath90 depending on the wind velocity @xmath91 , in m / s .",
    "both models assume that photons are reflected and refracted at the interface according to the geometric optics laws .",
    "let us consider the calculation procedure by the example of a reflected photon .    _",
    "* periodic structure of the ocean surface . *",
    "_ initially we define the projections @xmath46 and @xmath48 of the coordinates @xmath92 and @xmath93 of  the  point at which the photon crosses the plane @xmath1 , onto the wavy surface with the assumption that one of the wave maxima coincides with the origin of the lrs .",
    "hence the @xmath46coordinate is the residue of @xmath94 and @xmath68 can be derived from the following equations : @xmath95    further we proceed to the reference system @xmath96 in which the normal to the wavy surface at the point of the photon incidence serves as the @xmath97axis .",
    "let @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 be initial direction cosines of the photon in the lrs . then its direction cosines in the @xmath96 system are defined as @xmath101 where @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 , and @xmath106 is the angle between axes @xmath97 and @xmath2 : @xmath107    finally we determine the direction cosines @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 of the photon reflected and appropriate reflection coefficient .",

    "note that the cs model seems to be more realistic as constructing a kind of `` ripple '' on the ocean surface .",
    "moreover , it depends on only one parameter , the wind velocity .",
    "however the situation where a grid of chaotic `` flutters '' is superimposed on an ordered structure , appeared to us to be more appropriate in the case of intense waves .",
