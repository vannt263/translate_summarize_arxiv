    "<S> a recent mean - field approach to the fractional quantum hall effect ( qhe ) is reviewed , with a special emphasis on the application to single - electron tunneling through a quantum dot in a high magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is based on the adiabatic principle of greiter and wilczek , which maps an incompressible state in the integer qhe on the fractional qhe . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle contribution to the addition spectrum is analyzed , for a quantum dot with a parabolic confining potential . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is shown to be related to the fock - darwin spectrum in the integer qhe , upon substitution of the electron charge by the fractional quasiparticle charge . </S>",
    "<S> implications for the periodicity of the aharonov - bohm oscillations in the conductance are discussed . </S>",
