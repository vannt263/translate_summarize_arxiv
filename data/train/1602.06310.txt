    "similar objects are large ly@xmath0 nebulae surrounding some high redshift radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is much less clear what is the source of emission in labs .",
    "most probable proposed sources of energy are : photoionization by starbursts or by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , superwinds driven by starburst supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , cooling radiation from cold streams of gas accreting onto galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or some combination thereof ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "labs are rare ( with comoving number density @xmath9 mpc@xmath10 - @xmath11 mpc@xmath10 ) and preferentially found in overdense regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indicates that labs could be the sites of the formation of the most massive galaxies .",

    "labs are not observed below @xmath12 , but , in the local universe some star - forming galaxies are observed with extended ly@xmath0 emission to @xmath13 kpc @xcite .",
    "a large number of labs is associated with submillimetre and infrared sources @xcite or with obscured agn @xcite , which could indicate a significant role of stellar feedback and agn in their luminosity .",
    "for example , @xcite used mid - ir and submillimeter observations of labs at @xmath14 which are detected by @xcite and @xcite , and they have found that ir emission of 60 per cent of labs originates mostly from sf , while the rest are powered by agn or extreme starburst .",
    "in addition , a large lab firstly discovered by @xcite is observed to have polarized radiation , which indicates presence of central source of energy @xcite .",
    "however , a number of labs are not associated with sources that are powerful enough to explain the observed ly@xmath0 luminosities , or have large equivalent widths which are not easily explained with star formation . in such cases cooling radiation",
    "could play a dominant role in lab luminosity @xcite ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite found that @xmath15 of the labs which they observed at @xmath16 have too large equivalent widths ( ews ) to be explained with simple photoionization by massive stars with salpeter initial mass function .",
    "however , these labs could still be explained if the stars are zero - metallicity stars or with stellar initial mass function with an extreme slope of @xmath17 , or if ionizing uv sources are hidden from our line of sight . in addition ,",
    "@xmath18 percent of objects observed by @xcite at @xmath19 are most likely powered by cooling radiation , and they show a correlation between ly@xmath0 luminosities and velocity widths . besides these sources of energy , resonant scattering could significantly influence the observed ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "@xcite observed sb profiles in ly@xmath0 line and uv continuum in deep imaging .",
    "they found that the ly@xmath0 emission comes mainly from scattered radiation from galaxy hii regions , and that on average the contribution from cooling radiation is not significant .",
    "similar , but much more common and usually less bright , objects are lyman - alpha emitters ( laes ) . they are usually defined as objects with ly@xmath0 equivalent width larger than 20 .",
    "@xcite observed laes at @xmath20 , and concluded that if observations are deep enough than all laes would be classified as labs , with extended ly@xmath0 emission ( but see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "laes are observed at a range of redshifts from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , and higher ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of laes at @xmath23 are young metal - poor star - forming galaxies , most probably with a negligible fraction of agn activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some laes have high equivalent widths , which are not explained by a simple star formation with a salpeter imf . as determined from population synthesis models , laes have small stellar masses of @xmath24 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "agn activity is detected in some fraction of laes @xcite .",
    "observations and theoretical models showed that the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium has an important role in galaxy formation and evolution .",

    "after cooling it collapses into galaxies in a presumably spherically symmetric manner . in the cold mode",
    ", gas maintains a temperature of @xmath26 k and is accreted onto galaxies in the form of filamentary streams .",
    "simulations show that most of the baryons in a galaxy are accreted via the cold mode ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while the cold gas is streaming towards the dark - matter halo potential well , gravitational binding energy is released and the hydrogen atoms are excited , followed by cooling emission of ly@xmath0 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "previously a number of authors have created simulations and analytical models which tried to explain lab emission through the cooling radiation alone .",
    "some of them are briefly summarized here .",
    "@xcite developed an analytical model to predict ly@xmath0 emission of galaxies from cooling radiation of cold gas accreting into galaxies . according to their work ,",
    "if @xmath27 per cent of the gravitational energy of the gas is radiated away , their labs have similar ly@xmath0 luminosity functions and line widths as the observed labs at @xmath16 , however their diameters seem to be too large .",
    "@xcite used cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to calculate ly@xmath0 emission from cooling radiation in galaxies inside massive haloes at high redshift , where labs are expected to be found .",
    "their luminosity function is in agreement with observation of @xcite at @xmath16 , and the relation luminosity ",
    "area is roughly in agreement with the same observation .",
    "in addition , they derived an analytical model based on released gravitational energy from infalling gas , which provides similar results .",
    "however , @xcite showed that adding a more precise calculation of radiative transfer changes these results .",
    "they used cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to predict ly@xmath0 emission from cooling radiation , which included a precise calculation of radiative transfer of the ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "when self - shielding and sub - resolution models are properly included in a simulation , the computed luminosities could differ by an order of magnitude .",
    "@xcite concluded that it is difficult to explain labs luminosities only with cooling radiation , unless if the gas of density sufficient to form stars is in gaseous phase .",
    "@xcite simulated massive haloes and described cold streams with better resolution than in previous simulations .",
    "they have also properly modelled self shielding from uv background , and calculated gravitational efficiency of cooling radiation .",
    "their simulated labs have luminosity , extent and morphology in agreement with observations , but they slightly overpredict labs abundances ( at @xmath28 ) .",
    "photoionization by starbursts alone or in a combination with cooling radiation is another probable model proposed to explain labs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite developed a starburst model for labs , in which they also included ly@xmath0 emission from cooling radiation . in their model ,",
    "emission from gravitational sources ( which includes cooling radiation ) is significant , but sub - dominant compared to stellar emission .",
    "they successfully reproduced lab luminosity function and luminosity - size relation at @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite used cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to predict ly@xmath0 properties of progenitors of local @xmath29 galaxies with size and substructure similar to milky way . according to their results , ly@xmath0 emission from cooling radiation increases with redshift , contributing roughly @xmath30 per cent of the total at @xmath31 .",
    "however , in all of these works derived properties of simulated labs were compared to the observed labs at @xmath16 ( @xcite survey , volume @xmath32 ) , but none of them included observations at other redshifts .",
    "more importantly , their volumes are less than a volume necessary to produce an average labs number density : e.g. @xcite survey has a volume of @xmath33 mpc@xmath34 , while simulations have volumes of up to @xmath35 mpc@xmath34 ( table [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "an exception is analytical model of @xcite who assumed sheth - tormen distribution of haloes and @xcite dark matter profiles .",
    "it is computationally expensive to simulate a large volume in a hydrodynamical simulation and keep all of the required physics . in an another approach , large scale cosmological dark matter ( dm )",
    "simulations could be combined with semi - analytical recipes .",
    "this is applied in our work .",
    "the recipes used include cold gas accretion rates from a ( smaller - scale ) hydrodynamical simulation , stellar masses from matching of dm haloes to the observed galaxies , escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons from comparison of observed sfr functions to ly@xmath0 luminosity functions , and intergalactic opacity from observations of ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "@xmath36 - coefficient 0.81 is used from @xcite fit for cold gas + interstellar medium accretion rates at @xmath37 . for @xmath38 at redshifts",
    "@xmath39 and at radii @xmath40 and @xmath41 we use fit that has the same slope as that one of fg11 .",
    "for each redshift ( @xmath42 ) we find the point from the plot in the middle between the two points that are related to the most massive haloes : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and fit these 6 points with straight lines with shape @xmath45 .",
    "we approximate cold gas accretion rates calculated in @xcite , @xmath47 , as a function of cold gas accretion rates calculated in @xcite , @xmath48 , as follows : for masses @xmath49 : @xmath50 , and for masses @xmath51 : @xmath52 , where @xmath53 for @xmath54 , @xmath55 for @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "figure [ fig : a1 ] shows that in this way we could well describe @xmath47 .",
    "we assume that the same relation between @xmath47 and @xmath48 holds at each radius @xmath59 inside a halo . in figure",
    "[ fig : a2 ] we show that at @xmath60 and for halo masses @xmath61 our approximation of @xmath47 is in agreement with @xcite cold gas accretion rates at radii @xmath62 inside a halo .        as figure [ fig:8 ] shows the discrepancy at @xmath65 yr@xmath4 , we compare our results from the dm simulation with the results calculated from the millennium - ii simulation @xcite , which has more than 100 times better mass resolution and @xmath66 times smaller volume .",

    "full and dashed lines represent lfs calculated for subhalo masses m - crit200 and for total subhalo masses , respectively . , width=302 ]      at each redshift , we select subhaloes with more than 1000 particles ( which corresponds to a mass of @xmath74 ) . for each subhalo",
    "we select all of its progenitors from the previous snapshot with more than 50 particles .",
    "for all subhaloes we select its total mass . for subhaloes which are dominant in its friend - of - friends group , we select its mass m - crit200 , which is the mass within the radius where the subhalo has an overdensity 200 times the critical density of the simulation .    using these data",
    ", we calculate lfs and sfrfs in the same way as for dm simulation ( figures [ fig:18 ] and [ fig:19 ] , respectively ) .",
    "when we use the millennium - ii simulation , the results are almost the same , except that at low end sfrfs are higher and in a relatively good agreement with observations .",
    "lfs almost did not change at the range of luminosities in which labs and laes from figure [ fig:4 ] are observed .",
    "figure [ fig:22 ] shows the convergence properties of lfs ( for luminosities in the range @xmath75 $ ] erg s@xmath4 ) and sfrfs ( for sfrs in the range @xmath76 $ ] @xmath77 yr@xmath4 ) .",
    "it could be seen that for mass resolutions @xmath78 and @xmath79 the calculated lfs and sfrfs almost do not differ .",
