    "( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) used these type of marshal - olkin bivariate distribution in several papers .",
    "estimation through em algorithm can be seen there . but estimation of absolutely continuous version of bivariate pareto through em algorithm is a different ball - game .",
    "we suggest different innovative methods to solve the problem .",
    "the distribution can be used as an alternative model for the data transformed via peak over threshold method .",
    "bivariate pareto has wide application in modeling data related to finance , insurance , environmental sciences and internet network .",
    "the dependence structure of absolutely continuous version of bivariate pareto can also be described by well - known marshall - olkin copula [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the methodology proposed in this paper works for moderately larger sample .",
    "a random variable x is said to have pareto of second kind , i.e. @xmath0 if it has the survival function or ddf @xmath1 and the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath2 with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "block and basu @xcite proposed an absolutely continuous bivariate exponential distribution . later kundu and gupta @xcite introduced an absolutely continuous bivariate generalized exponential distribution , whose marginals are not generalized exponential distributions .",
    "many papers related to multivariate extreme value theory talk about absolutely continuous/ singular bivariate and multivariate pareto distribution [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "none of them mentioned anything on marshal - olkin form of the distribution .",
    "the major problem with both marshall - olkin singular / absolutely continuous pareto distribution with location and scale parameter is to verify the assumption of the distribution from the data .",
    "even taking location and scale parameter as zero and one respectively , estimation of the marshall - olkin singular / absolutely continuous pareto distribution is not straight forward .",
    "we arrange the paper in the following way . in section 2",
    "we keep the marshall - olkin bivariate pareto formulation . in section 3",
    ", we describe the em algorithm for singular case",
    ". different extension of em algorithm for absolutely continuous version is available in section 4 .",
    "some simulation results show the performance of the algorithm in section 5 . in section 5",
    "we show data analysis .",
    "finally we conclude the paper in section 6 .",
    "let @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 be three independent univariate pareto distributions @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we define @xmath12 and @xmath13 . we can show that @xmath14 jointly follow bivariate pareto distribution of second kind @xmath15    the joint distribution can be given by @xmath16    where @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19    we denote bivariate pareto distribution as bvpa and its absolutely continuous part as bvpac .",
    "surface and contour plots of the pdf are shown in figure-[fig1 ] and figure-[fig2 ] respectively .",
    "+   + [ fig1 ]     +   + [ fig2 ]      we assume that the random vector @xmath20 follows an absolutely continuous bivariate pareto distribution ( as described in @xcite ) .    the joint pdf of bvpac can be written as @xmath21 where c is a normalizing constant and @xmath22 and @xmath23 denotes the pdf of univariate distribution .",
    "likelihood function for the parameters of the bvpac can be written as @xmath24    the three parameter or likelihood function taking @xmath25 and @xmath26 corresponding to this pdf can be given by @xmath27    clearly direct maximization will lead to three dimensional optimization problem . to avoid the problem we implement em algorithm and",
    "we proceed the same estimation procedure exactly as we did in the last section .",
    "marginal distribution of @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be obtained by routine calculation .",
    "expressions are as follows :    @xmath30    @xmath31    respectively , where @xmath32",
    "now we divide our data into three parts : -    @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35    we do not know @xmath36 is @xmath6 or @xmath37 and we do not know @xmath38 is @xmath6 or @xmath39 .",
    "so we introduce two new random variables ( @xmath40 ) as @xmath41 and @xmath42    the @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the missing values of the e - m algorithm . to calculate the e - step we need the conditional distribution of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    using the definition of @xmath36 and @xmath38and @xmath43 and @xmath44 we have :    @xmath45 both @xmath43 and @xmath44 + @xmath46",
    "@xmath47 @xmath43 is known,@xmath44 is unknown , @xmath48    therefore we need to find out @xmath49 + @xmath50 @xmath51 is known , @xmath43 is unknown , @xmath52 moreover we need @xmath53 and @xmath54    since , each posterior probability corresponds to one of the ordering from table-[ordering ] , we calculate @xmath55 using the probability of appropriate ordering .",

    "first we transform the simple return series into log - return of two stocks . from @xcite , we know that peak over threshold method on random variable u provides polynomial generalized pareto distribution for any @xmath56 with @xmath57 i.e. @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the distribution function of @xmath60 .",
    "we choose appropriate @xmath61 and @xmath56 so that data should behave like near pareto distribution .",
    "we assume the data to follow near equal to absolutely continuous marshall olkin bivariate pareto and try to verify our assumption .",
    "we fit the empirical survival functions with the marginals of this bivariate pareto whose parameters can be obtained from the em algorithm that we have develop .",
    "we find good fit for both the marginals .",
    "the data analysis is performed based on sample size 1263 .",

    "the approximation process runs in multiple stages .",
    "therefore the algorithm works better for larger sample size .",
    "estimation procedure even in the case of three parameters is not straightforward .",
    "the paper also shows some innovative approach to handle for the estimation in case of location and scale parameters .",
    "the solution is wonderful , though there is very low probability that for some bad sample it may not work . since the likelihood function is discontinuous with respect to location and scale parameters , it is very difficult to construct aymptotic confidence interval .",
    "our approach by parametric bootstrap confidence interval provides useful solution of this problem .",
    "also it s very difficult to identify the singular or absolutely continuous assumption just by looking at the data .",
    "therefore we may use aic criteria to select the best possible distribution given the data .",
