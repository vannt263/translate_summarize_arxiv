    "the colours we perceive around us vary almost continuously between different tones . only careful scrutiny of the light emitted by pure substances through diffraction gratings at the end of the 19th century demonstrated the separation of these colours into discrete lines , opening a window to a new world of phenomena . in the same way we hope that the spectral lines that form the light of the strong interactions will be resolved and the energy differences between them will help us understand the dynamics of the strong force in detail . with this statement of purpose in mind , in this note",
    "i comment on the spectroscopy of light mesons , with special attention to non conventional @xmath0 states .",
    "the first observation i would like to make is that the theory of the strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) _ must _ present a mass gap . to understand it ,",
    "think of the meson fock space of this quantum field theory , @xmath1 given a state with any particular quantum numbers and a given mass , we could construct another state with the same quantum numbers and extremely close mass by just adding a pair of the current partons to it .",
    "therefore there would be no discrete part to the spectrum at all .",
    "this may in fact not be such a bad approximation at high masses , but the low lying states follow definitely a discrete pattern .",
    "therefore , adding a quark - antiquark pair or a couple of gluons to any one state must have an energetic cost , the mass gap .",
    "the constituent quark model tells us what the cost of a constituent light quark ( u or d ) is : @xmath2 , about a third of the mass of the proton . for the strange quark @xmath3",
    "( half of the mass of the @xmath4 meson ) is just about right .",
    "there is no consensus on the gluon mass gap , i will give below some indications on this respect .",
    "let me conduct for you the following simple exercise .",
    "take the meson counts ( in the sense of `` letter counts '' , ignore any spin or isospin degeneracies ) from the last pdg listings @xcite , accept the `` established '' and `` confirmed '' resonances as good candidates and bin them , say every @xmath5 . to have a simple theoretical benchmark , construct an arithmetic @xmath6 quark model in which the quarks cost as discussed in the previous paragraph 300 or 500 @xmath7 depending on flavour , each angular excitation 401 @xmath7 and each radial excitation @xmath8 .",
    "the result is plotted in figure [ counts ] .",
    "the `` arithmetic '' quark model meson counts ( circles ) fall short of detected resonances ( diamonds ) in the mass region below @xmath9.,width=245 ]    from the figure one can derive two observations : that the observed number of mesons is more than expected below about @xmath9 , leading us to conclude that non conventional mesons have already been detected , and second that the meson counts drop dramatically thereafter , even below the minimal quark model expectations . therefore , there is ample room for the discovery of new resonances , both conventional and nonconventional , in the @xmath10 range .      in the conventional quark model ,",
    "mesons are made of a pair quark - antiquark whose quantum numbers are very simply constructed . in the center of mass frame there is only one orbital angular momentum associated to the relative coordinate @xmath11 and two spins @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "coupling the two spins to give total spin @xmath14 and then the orbital angular momentum @xmath15 to give a total angular momentum @xmath16 leads to the wavefunction @xmath17 .",
    "parity reverses the sign of @xmath11 and the spherical harmonic yields a phase @xmath18 , and since the intrinsic parities of particle and antiparticle are opposite , the total parity is @xmath19 .",
    "to form eigenstates of charge conjugation the two particles need to have the same flavour , in which case applying @xmath20 reverses their respective role and therefore we collect a phase from the spin clebsch - gordan and a phase from the spherical harmonic @xmath21 .",
    "giving now integer values to @xmath15 and @xmath14 , with @xmath16 taking the values @xmath22 to @xmath23 we can construct the ordinary meson quantum numbers @xmath24 : @xmath25 from the list will be missing the quantum numbers @xmath26 and a meson in these channels is called @xmath24-exotic , whereas a meson with ordinary quantum numbers but potentially higher fock space content than @xmath27 is called a cryptoexotic or hidden exotic .",
    "we can also define flavour exotics to be those mesons with isospin equal or higher than @xmath28 or strangeness equal or higher than 2 , since their minimal @xmath27 assignment is not allowed .",
    "this old saying of quantum mechanics has a two - fold meaning in exotic spectroscopy . on one hand",
    ", the theory of the strong interactions does not forbid the existence of exotic mesons",
    ". they will therefore be found . still they are obviously not the dominant form of strongly interacting matter , rather an oddity .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that they are subleading in a large @xmath29 expansion , and by the mass gap that extra particles cost .",
    "on the other hand this makes cryptoexotics a difficult task .",
    "all mesons with ordinary quantum numbers will have an ordinary @xmath6 leading fock space assignment to some extent . in this respect , one should target searches to mesons with explicitly exotic quantum numbers for a clear discovery .",
    "the benchmark hadronic interactions like @xmath30 scattering in an @xmath31 wave , or @xmath32 scattering in @xmath33 , that had they shown resonant behaviour would have signaled exotic hadrons , are empirically repulsive .",
    "there is a quark model explanation within the resonating group method @xcite which i briefly sketch .",
    "first consider a hadron bound by an attractive color exchange modeled with a potential .",
    "the single exchange @xmath34 vanishes because of the color factor ( two color singlets can not exchange a color octet ) . with a pauli exchange",
    "@xmath35 the diagram gives a net repulsive contribution .",
    "this can happen only if the wavefunctions of both hadrons overlap ( to allow the pauli exchange ) and gives rise to the core nucleon - nucleon repulsion that guarantees nuclear stability against collapse .    in the case of mesons",
    ", the constituent quark model can not reproduce the low energy theorems that guarantee an attractive force to compensate this repulsion since the constituent quark mass explicitly breaks chiral symmetry .",
    "a simple field theoretical extension employing the bethe - salpeter equations @xcite or the instantaneous random phase approximation @xcite allows for an annihilation diagram @xmath36 that provides the necessary attractive force . this diagram vanishes unless the flavors of a quark and the antiquark in the other meson are equal .",
    "therefore , in exotic flavor scattering where this flavor equality is not possible the repulsive interaction is not cancelled and exotic flavor channels remain usually repulsive , although with excited quantum numbers this can change . in the rpa some attractive diagrams in addition to this due to the back - propagating wave function are always present and help guarantee the adler zero , but the interaction will remain repulsive although weak .",
    "the argument is not valid at very low energies ( where pion exchange is the dominant interaction , the deuteron binds after all ) nor higher energies where the potential model has little to say .",
    "the number of meson resonances is growing rapidly .",
    "there are now enough established ( or firm candidates ) to fill up to fourteen @xmath37 nonets ( and meson spectroscopy is starting to resemble plant botanics ) .",
    "some of the assignments below are controversial , but bear them for a moment as a starting point for the discussion .",
    "older than me are the pseudoscalar @xmath38 $ ] and vector @xmath39 $ ] nonets that correspond to the @xmath40 , @xmath41 quark model nonets ( with a small @xmath42-wave mixing in the vector nonet ) .",
    "of course , the charge conjugation assignments given do not apply to the open flavor mesons , and one should keep in mind possible mixing between states with equal @xmath43 .",
    "the quark model s @xmath44 , @xmath45 nonet is also filled by @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "late developments @xcite indicate that we have now two scalar multiplets , one from the @xmath0 triplet @xmath44 , @xmath33 @xmath47 $ ] ( with all the @xmath48 mixing , i am just counting states ) and what looks like an @xmath14-wave dimeson molecule nonet @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the pseudovector ( flavor ) nonet of the ( spin ) triplet is also filled with @xmath50 $ ] and there are now two complete tensor nonets , for example the assignments @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] . ( or exchange one of the @xmath53 by the @xmath54 ) .",
    "they lie too close to each other for radial excitations , so again we have a likely manifestation of meson molecules or four quark states with conventional @xmath0 mesons .",
    "radial excitations do appear in the spectrum , and already in complete nonets .",
    "we can fill two more pseudoscalar nonets @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] and almost two more vector nonets @xmath57 $ ] and @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the higher one corresponds mostly to a @xmath42-wave , the lower to the radial excitation @xcite .",
    "the lack of a @xmath4 meson at this scale is quite a puzzle and a challenge to da@xmath59ne .",
    "a comment from the audience informs us that in the @xmath60 factories the next @xmath4 seems to appear well above 2 @xmath61 . even in the likely case of ideal mixing that would imply quite a high mass",
    ": we expect a value around 1.9 @xmath61 .",
    "there are a number of other @xmath62 resonances reported , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ... that having open flavor , should be accompanied by corresponding @xmath65 and @xmath4 mesons independently of their fock space assignments .",
    "so there are plenty of opportunities for da@xmath59ne to clarify the situation if the beam energy is increased to 2 @xmath61 . to complete the discussion",
    "let me comment on the higher angular momentum multiplets .",
    "the @xmath42-wave @xmath66 , @xmath45 also seems to be complete with @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding @xmath33 ( mixing to @xmath68-wave possible ) can be also assigned to @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "then a quark model @xmath70-wave , @xmath71 $ ] and unless one is very interested in regge theory or how the strong interactions depend on angular momentum , candidates to fill higher multiplets can be ignored for now .",
    "the particle tables collect an assortment of extra resonances that i do not mention here @xcite .",
    "a few are worth remarking though .",
    "there is an extra @xmath53 at low energy ( i left out the @xmath54 for a cryptoexotic candidate , by which i mean a linear combination of the low energy @xmath53 ) , then the @xmath72 , both containing to some extent a four - quark component .",
    "then an extra @xmath48 where again i left the @xmath73 to represent the appropriate combination of the @xmath48 s that likely construct the glueball state .",
    "if the dubious @xmath74 is confirmed we might have a @xmath75 in excess with the @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "then some resonances are obviously missing : a @xmath78 around @xmath9 would complete a second @xmath79 nonet , an @xmath80 around 1800 would be an interesting addition to fill a @xmath81 nonet , there being a reported @xmath82 ( this automatically would pull two of the @xmath48 s out of the glueball candidate list , and there are some reported in the @xmath83 region ) .",
    "also a @xmath84 in the @xmath85 region would make some @xmath86 mesons fall in place , and outstandingly for this conference s purpose , a @xmath4 in the @xmath87 range is definitely expected .",
    "the firm candidates for explicitly exotic mesons are the @xmath88 broad structures with mass and width @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 .",
    "the first has a decay mode into @xmath93 , the second into @xmath94 .",
    "a sensible account of the current status ( and my favorite interpretation , see below ) of these resonances is given in @xcite .",
    "there might now be a third candidate around @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "for very long these two states have been accused of being hybrid mesons , specially the second since it decays to the supposedly `` glue rich '' channel with an @xmath95 .",
    "these arguments do not resist closer examination and the trophy for a hybrid meson is still open .",
    "there is also a very interesting candidate , @xmath96 with reported isospin 2 .",
    "if confirmed , this would be the first case of a meson with a _ guaranteed _ four - quark leading wavefunction @xcite .      beyond mass and width assignments ,",
    "a detailed understanding of mesons requires predictions for their branching ratios into different possible open channels .",
    "the favorite model for these calculations is the @xmath97 model ( t. barnes has just completed a short historical account where references can be tracked @xcite ) . in this mechanism , completing quantum - mechanical models of mesons such as the constituent quark model or the flux tube model at a fixed particle number , a @xmath0 pair is pulled out of the fermi sea , and a rearrangement of color by a pauli exchange leads to a two - meson decay . for example , for a conventional meson one would have : @xmath98 within the @xmath97 model there are extensive decay calculations assisting experimental searches of hybrid mesons @xcite in the flux tube model .",
    "( the decays of ordinary mesons have also been extensively studied ) .",
    "an outstanding prediction for hybrid mesons is their preference to decay to a pair of @xmath14-@xmath99 mesons .",
    "let us also adopt the point of view of a quantum field theory hamiltonian .",
    "the first task is to perform a diagonalization in the fock space to find the representation of the mesons in each channel , say for exotic meson @xmath100 .",
    "then , once the hamiltonian has been exactly diagonalized , the leading decay to two mesons proceeds by the wavefunction overlap of the four - quark component of the state with the state of two mesons streaming freely to the detector .",
    "that is , all two meson decays proceed via `` fall - apart '' decays of the four quark component . for a hybrid this mechanism can be depicted as @xmath101 where any possible rescattering between the fermion lines in the second diagram should have already been taken into account in the construction of the various meson - fermion vertices , and the annihilation or absorption of the gluon in the first diagram should likewise already have been taken into account in the diagonalization of the hamiltonian to construct the total wavefunction of the state .",
    "this diagram shows that _ all _ exotica decay to lowest order via its minimal multiquark component in a field - theoretical description ( where `` lowest order '' refers to the wavefunctions of the final state mesons , that taken as conventional mesons , start with @xmath0 , that is , lowest order in the constituent mass gap ) . therefore , the hybrid wavefunction component of a meson hides behind the four ( six ) quark component as hadronic decays are concerned .",
    "since the gluons do not carry electric charge , similar considerations apply to radiative decays .",
    "this shows that until we have an excellent grasp of the physics of four and more quark states , we will not be able to fully trust predictions on the possible decays of exotica .",
    "the result is unlike a lottery , where purchasing a ticket ( detecting a @xmath24-exotic meson ) gives you a winning chance ( an explicit gluonic excitation in the spectrum ) . here",
    "until you have all the tickets in your hand you do nt collect your prize , since unravelling the wavefunctions in ( [ fallapart ] ) is an arduous theoretical task , and we require knowledge of all excitations in the reasonable energy range for a given channel .",
    "glueballs are an interesting theoretical construction . even without quarks ,",
    "since chromodynamics is a non - abelian theory with non - linear gluon self - couplings , there would still be mesons .",
    "the spectrum has been calculated in the lattice on a number of occasions .",
    "the result of a well - known calculation is reproduced ( courtesy of the authors of @xcite ) in figure [ glueballspec ] .",
    "the lattice glueball spectrum ( c. morningstar and m. peardon).,width=283 ]    one sometimes wonders how inputing random numbers , valuable organized numbers are output , but this is so : the salient features of this spectrum are very well captured in model terms @xcite .",
    "if one attempts to couple two massive constituent vector bosons in an s - wave to form a bound state , the possible quantum numbers would be @xmath102 . by observing figure [ glueballspec ]",
    "we see that the @xmath103 state is absent from the low - lying spectrum",
    ". therefore a massive constituent gluon model fails .",
    "but a model with transverse gluons , such as based in the coulomb gauge , automatically succeeds thanks to yang s two - photon theorem . in these models",
    ", a gluon bcs mass - gap equation is solved that generates a gluon mass dynamically .",
    "then the gluons can maintain their transverse nature since there is no explicit mass term and , being bosons , can not couple to spin 1 .",
    "solution of the tamm - dancoff equation for the two - body problem provides a spectrum similar to the lattice results at low energy .",
    "another obvious feature in figure [ glueballspec ] is that odd - parity glueballs are heavier .",
    "this in two - gluon models follows from the necessity of a p - wave .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath104 predicts the @xmath99-wave glueballs to have @xmath105 .",
    "finally , the negative charge conjugation states are even heavier , also natural in a model where a third gluon would be necessary ( and again the mass - gap lifts this state ) .    the gluon mass gap can be predicted from this lattice data to be about 800 - 900 @xmath7 .",
    "the lightest scalar glueball thus appears at 1600 @xmath7 ( or above ) and the tensor glueball separated by a hyperfine splitting , slightly above 2 @xmath61 .",
    "this mass gap is tied to the string tension calculated in the same lattice ( the same happens in model calculations ) .",
    "finally the obvious remark that gluons carry no flavor quantum numbers , and therefore glueballs appear only as singlets in the spectrum , stirred through the @xmath48 , @xmath53 families . a study to disentangle the glueball components @xcite",
    "( with the approximation of ignoring four quark states ) has found the scalar glueball to be shared between the @xmath106 and @xmath73 with some component in the @xmath107 .",
    "this is based on decay predictions from flavor @xmath37 symmetry for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 pairs and gives a qualitative picture of how difficult cryptoexotica may be : the only manifestation of this glueball state seems to be a supernumerary scalar meson .",
    "short of direct detection , a second window to glueballs and the gluon mass gap is provided by high energy physics . the interaction between static color sources at long distance follows a linear behavior , according to lattice qcd studies .",
    "this provides the theoretical basis for the linear potential and for the observation that mesons fall on straight lines in a plot of @xmath16 versus @xmath111 ( see figure [ reggemesons ] ) .     some meson regge trajectories .",
    ", width=245 ]    similar plots can be produced for baryons lending support to a diquark wavefunction clustering , but that is a theme for a different conference .",
    "in coulomb gauge qcd the potential interaction acts between color charge densities , and therefore the color charges associated to the gluons ( after dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , also static charges ) interact with a similar potential .",
    "a difference is the color factor for the potential exchange , 3 for gluon - gluon as opposed to 4/3 for @xmath6 .",
    "this changes the slope of the regge trajectories and brings them close to parallel to the famous pomeron regge trajectory @xmath112 equating @xmath113 we see that glueball exchange probably plays a role in total cross sections at high @xmath114 , low @xmath115 .",
    "bcs / tamm - dancoff glueball spectrum with timelike cornell potential between color charge densities .",
    "the wavefunctions are constructed in the russell - saunders scheme and configuration mixing is not included .",
    "the solid line is the pomeron regge trajectory .",
    "states following to the left of it are unphysical and their low mass is probably due to excessive spin - orbit coupling.,width=283 ]     lattice glueball states also seem to fall on regge trajectories .",
    "the @xmath116 state , with larger error bars , recently calculated , is compatible with the pomeron trajectory.,width=283 ]    our glueball calculations @xcite , based on qcd time - like vector exchange , suffer from an excessive spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this is analogous to the same phenomenon in the quarkonium spectrum , that leads spectroscopists to hypothesize scalar confinement .",
    "therefore , to extract relatively model - independent information from our model glueball spectrum , we should look at states with a vanishing expectation value of @xmath117 .",
    "this is achieved if either @xmath40 or @xmath45 .",
    "for s=0 there is a regge trajectory formed by the glueballs @xmath118 , @xmath119 that passes by the lightest scalar glueball , parallel and below the pomeron trajectory . from this",
    ", the slope of all glueball regge trajectories can be extracted .",
    "there is still the @xmath40 case . with @xmath45",
    "we recover the scalar glueball .",
    "but with @xmath120 , the lowest - lying tensor glueball @xmath121 does not suffer from spin - orbit corrections and therefore we can confidently calculate its mass .",
    "we find it just above @xmath83 , and almost within lattice error bands , it falls right on the pomeron regge trajectory .",
    "other glueball states with quantum numbers @xmath122 calculated in the lattice seem to also fall on the pomeron trajectory , here the error bands being considerably larger .    in a more elaborate model",
    "we would expect glueballs with @xmath66 , @xmath123 , ... and spins aligned to also fall on or near the pomeron regge trajectory .",
    "currently this is not the case since our large spin - orbit coupling pushes these states left of the pomeron trajectory ( in contradiction with total energy cross section growths ) .",
    "therefore further work is required to improve the current models .",
    "similar results are reported by other authors @xcite with regge trajectories that start bending and behaving non - linearly .    as a conclusion , we expect fits to high energy cross - sections to provide a complementary approach to low energy spectroscopy in the understanding of gluonic excitations .",
    "it is also interesting that the odderon , regge pole exchange with negative @xmath20-parity , would produce differences between the @xmath124 and @xmath125 cross sections that are not experimentally observed . within our constituent approach",
    "this is again easy to understand , as negative parity glueballs require a third gluon and thus lie to the right of the pomeron trajectory and are less relevant for high @xmath114 scattering .",
    "hybrid mesons are also defined only with the help of a model . from the few - body point of view",
    "@xcite in that the quark - antiquark pair are accompanied by an explicit constituent gluon ( or in our models , a quasiparticle - gluon after dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ) , it is a relatively simple task to predict the quantum numbers of lowest lying hybrid states .",
    "consider the three - body system in its center of momentum ( cm ) frame .",
    "the remaining six momentum space coordinates can be chosen as @xmath126 ( the gluon s momentum is immediately determined in the cm frame ) .",
    "there are three particle spins , the quark and antiquark @xmath12 and @xmath13 and the gluon spin @xmath127 .",
    "all angular momenta can be then added @xmath128 with the usual angular momentum rules .",
    "of the several possible recouplings we choose to combine @xmath12 and @xmath13 to spin @xmath14 since then one can form ( for equal @xmath0 flavor ) eigenstates of charge conjugation with eigenvalue @xmath129 since the gluon is a vector state it brings an additional @xmath130 to the parity computation yielding @xmath131 the lowest lying states are expected to be those with @xmath132 , and the possible combinations are therefore @xmath133 .",
    "these have conventional quantum numbers and mix with ordinary @xmath0 mesons . allowing for a @xmath99 wave we have either @xmath134 , @xmath135 or @xmath136 , @xmath137 with various multiplicities due to the intermediate spin states .    in our model calculations",
    "the @xmath138 excitation is less expensive energetically ( @xmath139 can be taken as the variable conjugate to the quark - antiquark position , that see a net repulsion in a color octet ) therefore the lightest exotic hybrid mesons have quantum numbers @xmath88 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 in this approach .",
    "our model calculations with a variational approach and a modest wavefunction basis ( hence , upper bound to the minimum eigenvalues ) concludes there are no hybrid states , below @xmath83 .",
    "this is somewhat high compared to lattice expectations that estimate the first hybrid to lie around @xmath87 .",
    "in this there is not unanimous agreement , as recent calculations point to @xmath142 @xcite and @xmath143 @xcite for the lowest lying @xmath88 exotic hybrid .",
    "as flavor is concerned , hybrids come in flavor nonets as their regular @xmath0 counterparts .",
    "isospin @xmath144 hybrid mesons are expected to be lighter than @xmath145 as the following annihilation diagram    @xmath146    is only possible for isospin zero , and adds about @xmath147 to the mass of these states .",
    "an alternative description is provided by the flux tube model @xcite , inspired in lattice qcd in the limit of strong coupling .",
    "not surprisingly , the model ( usually combined with the born - oppenheimer approximation for heavy quarks ) is in good agreement with lattice data for @xmath148 states @xcite . for light hybrid states ,",
    "the model predicts isospin 1 multiplets with quantum numbers @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath103 , @xmath151 at about @xmath152 .",
    "the mass difference with our approach can be explained by the fact that this string simulating a flux tube provides for a color singlet potential ( therefore attractive ) between the quark and antiquark also in the excited ( hybrid ) configuration , whereas in an approach with an explicit qcd gluon the quark and antiquark are in a color octet configuration , repulsive .",
    "if the original flux - tube model is corrected employing the lattice excited adiabatic potential instead of the attractive coulomb tail from isgur and paton , the mass predictions rise again to above @xmath10 @xcite .    in any case",
    ", both approaches concur to predict exotic hybrids to be well above the two experimental candidates ( in disagreement with old bag model calculations @xcite ) .    given the large number of channels and possible angular momentum combinations , the spin splittings due to fine and hyperfine interactions in hybrid mesons , that lift the degeneracies between the various @xmath24 , are quite intricate .",
    "within our few - body approach , the relativistic structure of the hamiltonian provides for some splittings , but the @xmath153 time - like vector potential is known to be deficient in the ordinary meson sector , leaving this as an open issue .",
    "these splittings have been calculated in the context of the flux tube model @xcite and lift the degeneracy between the vector @xmath151 and exotic @xmath88 hybrid mesons .",
    "all theoretical approaches seem to concur that vector hybrids in the charmonium system should appear at about @xmath154 . in our calculations",

    "notice the ( unfortunate ? ) coincidence that the lowest exotic seems to be the @xmath88 and that four quark states are predicted to be lighter than hybrids . with the angular momentum construction above",
    "there is a unique way of constructing this state . but to build an isospin 1 state one can of course resort to @xmath174 or @xmath175 , and therefore two light , broad four quark structures are expected in agreement with observation . in other channels",
    "they may just be assigned to background as more prominent @xmath0 resonances appear , but in this exotic channel they have to be the first structures appearing . in this sense , the other exotic quantum numbers that hybrid mesons span are more promising .",
    "on occasion of another da@xmath59ne workshop , badalyan presented his results for four quark states @xcite .",
    "since these calculations have to my knowledge not been superseded by subsequent studies ( given the lack of experimental motivation ) , i abstract in table [ 4q ] the result for the center of gravity of the spin multiplets for the ground state . in both jaffe s and badalyan s",
    "work the scalar mesons are lightest , and the large ( unreliable ) spin splittings make further progress difficult .",
    "the lightest exotic @xmath88 was predicted at @xmath142 .",
    "c|cc m(flavor ) & badalyan(1987,1991 ) & jaffe(1977 ) +   + 4 light q & 1565 & 1540 + 2 light 2 s & 1950 & 1800 + 4 s & 2260 & 2150    another problem with these calculations is their lack of agreement with the low energy pion theorems : in channels where broad structures decay to light goldstone bosons , one would expect chiral symmetry to play a major role .",
    "only recently it was understood how to incorporate chiral symmetry into calculations beyond the spectrum through the rpa / bethe - salpeter approach @xcite and we may expect progress in this direction .    in the vector @xmath151 channel the four quark _",
    "_ leads to a prediction @xcite of a large number of states , at 1500 , 1660 , 1830 , 1860 , 1940 , 2000 , 2070 @xmath7 and this is not acceptable with our current understanding of the data . here",
    "is interesting work for theorists .",
    "initially we may assume they are broad and overlaping .",
    "an exception to the rule that four - quark states are broad can be found in the @xmath176 because it is just below its natural two kaon decay .",
    "this may happen again to some extent , so a number of interesting thresholds ( like the two @xmath65 , two @xmath4 or two nucleon ) are worth detailed scrutiny .    among theorists , there has been some skepticism about four - quark states ( with the exception of the light scalars ) , that can ( other than by lack of direct evidence ) partly be tracked to the work of weinstein and isgur @xcite who , conducting a variational calculation containing @xmath156 in the basis , found separate hadron states to be lighter than compact multiquarks .",
    "this has the advantage of providing some support for the nuclear physics picture where nuclei are clusters of nucleons , not of quarks .",
    "this expectations are at odds with the recent detection @xcite of a pentaquark . although a baryon , this state opens new perspectives in meson spectroscopy .",
    "this state , at @xmath177 , has been observed to decay to @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the threshold for this channel is @xmath180 and therefore there is sufficient phase space for the decay .",
    "the width of this @xmath181 state is intriguingly narrow , less than 10 mev .",
    "more interesting is the fact that its leading wavefunction assignment in fock space has to be @xmath182 and is therefore flavor exotic . if further confirmed beyond the present experimental data , this state supposes a true revolution in spectroscopy .",
    "we could ask ourselves if this state is a molecule in the sense of the @xmath176 or deuterium .",
    "but the @xmath183 interaction is repulsive in an @xmath14-wave , and only very mildly attractive in a @xmath99-wave ( recall our general discussion about exotic channels being repulsive ) . therefore the system does not resonate . it has been suggested @xcite that a pion would stabilize the system to form a three body state @xmath184 . we have performed standard calculations within the chiral lagrangian supplemented with unitary ( lippman - schwinger ) techniques @xcite and found there is indeed attraction in the @xmath185 channel preferred by theorists , but way insufficient to bind the system . this is consistent with the low energy database accumulated through the years : only at higher energies around @xmath186 there have been persisting hints @xcite of resonances that could fit into a molecular - type approach , collectively called @xmath187 .",
    "therefore if this state is confirmed , it will have to be assigned to a compact pentaquark structure bound by qcd forces . and",
    "open many questions as to what other multiquark states are there , and where .",
    "at least one six quark state obviously exists ( deuterium ) .",
    "it can be argued that it is totally a molecular state given its large radius and small binding energy .",
    "the question here is whether a six quark meson can be found .",
    "the obvious place to look is just under ( around ? ) the two nucleon threshold . along the years",
    "intermitent data have supported the existence of baryonium , with no conclusive evidence to date .",
    "lately there are promising candidates in the reaction @xmath188 at bes @xcite and in multipion production processes @xcite .",
    "the bes results are compatible with a @xmath189 resonance , that would suggest parabaryonium has been found ( the analogous of the pion with @xmath40 , @xmath45 , instead of a quark , a proton , and instead of an antiquark , an antiproton ) .",
    "this state has the proton and antiproton spins antialigned , and it should be accompanied by an almost degenerate vector state , @xmath151 ( orthobaryonium ) that is a prime candidate for searches at da@xmath59ne with an enhanced energy beam .",
    "these resonances are expected to be narrow ( by the necessity of annihilating that large number of valence quarks and the ozi rule ) , just below @xmath190 threshold and with suppressed @xmath191 decays ( no strange valence content in either of the constituents ) .",
    "an interesting question is whether this state appears in all possible channels @xmath192 ,",
    "@xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath124 , or just in the latter . in this case",
    "we could still argue on a nucleon - antinucleon state loosely bound by qed forces alone , violating isospin symmetry ( alternatively something totally different as one of the mentioned four - quark states or a hybrid state would be a possibility in this mass range ) .    in any case",
    ", since the quark model assignments for vector @xmath0 states predict the @xmath42-wave vector comfortably close to the @xmath195 and the next radial excitation is above @xmath83 , any vector resonance in the interval of energies @xmath196 is a prime cryptoexotic candidate .",
    "i hope to have conveyed to you some of the excitement in light exotic spectroscopy . in my view , below @xmath197 we have already a state saturation and the identification of the wave function components of four quark states is the most interesting problem . above @xmath198",
    "many conventional , let alone exotic and cryptoexotic are missing . to what extent",
    "they can be separated from one another and the continuum they form in most hadronic processes is a question of intelligent filters , multiple particle decay analysis and hard labor .",
    "the most intriguing excitations are those containing some sort of glue  glueballs and hybrid mesons , but they are hiding behind the purely quark ( let it be two or four ... ) wavefunctions in each channel .",
    "the model is the scalar glueball , probably already in our pocket as a supernumerary @xmath48 ( in fact , as a good quantum state , in both pockets at the same time ) .",
    "we expect the situation with the tensor glueball to be the same : just hard work ahead in the @xmath121 meson channel .    for hybrid mesons the situation would seem cleaner because of the possibility of exotic quantum numbers . but",
    "this is misleading since four quark states hide a hybrid as effectively as two quark states hide a glueball .",
    "the experimentally studied case , with @xmath88 quantum numbers is the model .",
    "other exotic waves should ( and probably will , in experiments like compass or glue - x ) be explored .    to correctly identify these excitations",
    "they need to be separated from four - quark states , about whom very little is known . in turn ,",
    "the best grasp on these states comes from flavor exotic waves .",
    "these are generally repulsive at low energies , but the possible detection of a pentaquark now should make us rethink about them . at higher energies",
    "more careful scans should be conducted .",
    "what contribution can da@xmath59ne make ?",
    "if the other important physics issues addressable by the upgraded machine allow the beam energy to be increased to 2 @xmath61 , then with its high luminosity it could make the best map of the @xmath199 energy interval where some interesting states may appear . to be really competitive with other experiments though",
    ", @xmath200 would be much better .",
    "then the vector isoscalar channel could be really mapped out to much higher energies , and the decay products would naturally span the @xmath201 region with different quantum numbers .",
    "the interested reader can find more information in the recent overview of curtis meyer @xcite where lots of tables and data are given that i do not reproduce here .",
