    "although not directly measurable , the inclusive cross section for higgs production is an observable of great interest , both experimentally ( serving as normalization for exclusive distributions ) and theoretically , due to the bad convergence properties of its perturbative expansion in the strong coupling @xmath2 . at large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "energies and for the standard model ( sm ) higgs , the inclusive cross section is largely dominated by the gluon fusion production mode , where the higgs couples to the gluons through a fermion loop , prevalently a top quark .",
    "being the top quark heavier than the sm higgs , an effective field theory can be introduced where the top is integrated out , leading to an effective pointlike gluon - gluon - higgs vertex .",
    "qcd corrections to this process are known for a long time at next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo )  @xcite in the heavy top limit ; the exact result at nlo is also known  @xcite , while finite top mass corrections at nnlo have been computed as an expansion in @xmath3 , being @xmath4 the higgs mass and @xmath5 the top mass  @xcite .",
    "the effective theory turns out to predict well @xmath6-factors ( ratios to the lo cross section ) for current lhc energies , but the accuracy of the theory is expected to decrease when the collider energy increases , due to the wrongly predicted high energy behavior at parton level  @xcite .",
    "these qcd corrections are huge : the nlo correction amounts to about @xmath7 of the lo cross section , while nnlo correction adds another @xmath8 . on top of that ,",
    "canonical renormalization and factorization scale variation bands ( by a factor of @xmath9 about the higgs mass ) do not overlap , as a symptom of a very bad convergence . choosing a smaller central renormalization scale ( @xmath10 ) slightly improves the described behavior , with nlo and nnlo bands now overlapping , but still being far from a decent convergence .",
    "for these reasons , there has been a big effort in going beyond nnlo . within the heavy top effective theory , the full next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath0lo ) computation is ongoing  @xcite ;",
    "in the meantime , some approximate predictions based on known all - order behaviors appeared  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , higher order contributions can be predicted by all - order resummations , specifically the so called @xmath11 resummation  @xcite and soft gluon resummation  @xcite .",
    "soft gluon resummation aims to resum logs of @xmath12 , being @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the partonic center of mass energy ; these logs are large at partonic threshold , where @xmath15 .",
    "although the higgs at lhc is very far from physical threshold , the partonic threshold is still dominant , due to the shape of the gluon luminosity that favors larger values of @xmath16 in the convolution with the partonic cross section  @xcite .",
    "however , whether the soft logarithms dominate at lhc strongly depends on the actual form of such logarithms , differing from each other by subdominant contributions vanishing at @xmath17 , as discussed at length in refs .",
    "soft gluon resummation is currently known at next - to - next - to - next - to - leading logarithmic accuracy n@xmath0ll@xmath1",
    "@xcite , where the prime denotes the inclusion of some formally higher order terms , which however contain the bulk of the next order correction  @xcite .",
    "this result has been computed with the standard formalism of qcd , sometimes referred to as direct qcd ( dqcd ) .",
    "alternatively , soft resummation can be realised within soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) , where it is known up to n@xmath0ll  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the scet result to n@xmath0ll@xmath1 .",
    "to do this , we need the hard and soft functions at three loop order , one order higher than what is used in the n@xmath0ll result of ref .  @xcite .",
    "while the first ingredient is known since a few years  @xcite , the second was unknown at the time of writing . exploiting the equivalence of scet and dqcd  @xcite",
    ", we extract the three loop expression of the soft function from the n@xmath0ll@xmath1 dqcd result .",

    "also , it is natural to match the n@xmath43ll result to n@xmath44lo , while the n@xmath43ll@xmath1  result is naturally matched to n@xmath45lo , because the hard and soft function contain ingredients to the same order .",
    "however , since currently the n@xmath0lo is not complete , in our analysis we will match n@xmath0ll@xmath1  to nnlo , which effectively corresponds to estimating the fixed order @xmath46 contribution with the order @xmath46 expansion of the n@xmath0ll@xmath1  resummed result .",
    "to derive the three loop soft function , we use the fact that the expansion of the n@xmath43ll@xmath1  must match the soft part of the fixed order n@xmath43lo result .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the way scet is constructed : the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 are found by subsequent matchings of full qcd onto scet .",
    "alternatively , this can be understood in terms of the equivalence of scet and dqcd  @xcite : for a particular choice of the scales @xmath32 and @xmath31 , scet and dqcd coincide to all orders in @xmath2 .",
    "additionally , the expansion of the scet n@xmath43ll@xmath1  result does not depend on @xmath32 and @xmath31 up to order @xmath47 : so , up to this order , the expansion must coincide with the same expansion in dqcd , independently on the scale choice .    therefore , to determine the soft function @xmath42 to order @xmath46 , we expand the scet result eq .   to order @xmath46 and equate it to the soft part of the fixed n@xmath0lo result  @xcite ( or , equivalently , the third order expansion of the dqcd resummed n@xmath0ll@xmath1  result  @xcite ) . since to this order",

    ", we follow the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely we vary each of the scales @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 about their central values , and add the resulting errors in quadrature ( after symmetrising each error ) . the central values for @xmath30 and @xmath31",

    "it is clear from the plot that the inclusion of resummation at each order has a small impact on the predicted cross section , given that each resummed result lies within the error band of the fixed order result to which it is matched .",
    "even the new nnlo+n@xmath0ll@xmath1  prediction , the last point of the plot , is compatible with the nnlo , although the central value is slightly larger , in agreement with the tendency found in refs .",
    "note also that the scale variation bands at resummed level are smaller than the fixed order bands at each order ( except lo ) , hinting that the uncertainty is underestimated , given that this is already the case for the fixed order results .",
    "these phenomena are in fact easy to understand . the choice of the soft logarithms adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite and used in this plot corresponds to plus distributions of the form @xmath67 .",
    "the presence of the @xmath68 factor in the logarithm comes from kinematics , and , though subleading at large @xmath16 , improves the agreement of the resummation when expanded in powers of @xmath2 with the fixed order ; however , the fixed order expansion of the resummation systematically underestimates the full result  @xcite , leading to such small impact to all orders . in ref .",
    "@xcite , on top of this kinematic improvement , it is shown that it is possible to include a class of subdominant ( i.e. , suppressed by powers of @xmath12 , and therefore beyond the leading power accuracy of scet ) logarithms of collinear origin to all orders in @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the simplest realization of this collinear improvement consists in multiplying all the plus distributions by a factor of @xmath16 , which is equivalent in @xmath52 space to a shift @xmath69  @xcite . with the inclusion of collinear contributions , adopted also in ref .",

    "@xcite described above . as expected ,",
    "the contribution of the soft logarithms is larger with this choice , also leading to a larger ( and more realistic ) scale uncertainty , mostly driven by @xmath30 uncertainty .",
    "also , the convergence is improved : excluding the lo+ll result ( which contains to few information ) , the nlo+nll@xmath1 , nnlo+nnll@xmath1  and nnlo+n@xmath0ll@xmath1  are compatible within the respective uncertainty bands . also , the convergence with primed accuracies seems to be better than the one of the unprimed results , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .    the cross section at nnlo+n@xmath0ll@xmath1  including the collinear contributions",
    "is predicted to be @xmath70  pb , corresponding to an increase of @xmath71 with respect to the fixed nnlo .",
    "this is compatible with the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is @xmath72  pb for the same configuration , thereby confirming the observation  @xcite that , practically , resummation performed in dqcd and scet with a soft scale choice as in ref .",
    "@xcite leads to similar results when equivalent forms of the soft logarithms are adopted .",
    "finally , we have also checked that the inclusion of the @xmath11 resummation , adopted as default in ref .",
    "@xcite , does not affect the final nnlo+n@xmath0ll@xmath1  result significantly ( by less than @xmath73 ) , giving @xmath74  pb ( when collinear improvement is included ) .",
    "however , as it is well known  @xcite , the inclusion of @xmath11 enhanced terms to all orders leads to a much faster convergence , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ; this is especially manifest in the collinear improved case , where we also observe that all the resummed results have overlapping uncertainty bands , thereby suggesting a more reliable estimate of the scale uncertainty .",
    "we have computed the three loop soft function for inclusive higgs production in gluon fusion , deriving it from the equivalence of the resummation as performed in dqcd and in scet .",
    "our result agrees with the very recent computation of ref .",

    "also , we propose a minimal modification of the form of the resummed soft logarithms which allows to include collinear contributions to the result .",
    "we find that the inclusion of these contributions is important , and leads to a faster convergence of the perturbative expansion , with more reliable uncertainty estimate from scale variation , further improved if the resummation of @xmath11 enhanced terms is included .",
