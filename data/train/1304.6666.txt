    "sampling from the _ gibbs distribution _ is well studied problem in computer science as well as in statistical physics .",
    "examples include sampling from the uniform ( or a weighted ) distribution over combinatorial structures like @xmath0-colourings , independent sets , matchings of a graph @xmath6 . in this work we focus on colourings and independent sets when the underlying graph is an instance of erds - rnyi random graph @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is ` large ' but remains bounded as @xmath7 .",
    "we say that an event occurs _ with high probability ( w.h.p . ) _ if the probability of the event to occur tends to 1 as @xmath7 .    for this kind of problems , the most powerful algorithms and",
    "somehow the most natural ones are based on the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "the setup is an ergodic , time - reversible markov chain over the @xmath0-colourings ( or independent sets ) of the underlying graph .",
    "the updates guarantee that the equilibrium distribution of the chain is the desired one . here",
    "we use standard _ glauber block updates _ ( in the course of this paper we refer to the chains as _ glauber dynamics _ ) .",
    "the main technical challenge is to establish that the underlying markov chain has _ rapid mixing _ , i.e. it converges sufficiently fast to the equilibrium distribution ( see @xcite ) .    given the input graph @xmath5 , the focus is on two distributions .",
    "the first one is the _ colouring model _ ,",
    "i.e. the uniform distribution over the @xmath0-colourings of the input graph .",
    "the second one is the _ hard - core model _ with _ fugacity _",
    "@xmath1 , i.e. each independent set @xmath8 is assigned probability measure proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "the parameters of interest are the number of colours @xmath0 and the fugacity @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the aim is to show _ rapid mixing _ for @xmath0 as small as possible and @xmath1 as large as possible for the corresponding models .    for mcmc algorithms",
    "to be rapidly mixing , typically , the bounds for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are expressed in terms of the _ maximum degree _ of the underlying graph .",
    "examples of such bounds are @xcite for colouring and @xcite for independent sets . in that terms",
    ", what makes the case of @xmath5 special is the ( relatively ) big fluctuation in the degree of the vertices . to be more specific , w.h.p .",
    "the vast majority of vertices in @xmath5 are of degree close to @xmath4 , while the maximum degree is as huge as @xmath10 .",
    "in such a situation , it is natural to expect that the rapid mixing bounds for both @xmath0 , @xmath1 depend on the _ expected degree _",
    "@xmath4 , rather than the maximum degree .",
    "sophisticated but mathematically non rigorous arguments from statistical physics ( e.g. in @xcite ) support this picture . roughly speaking , they suggest that w.h.p . over the instances of @xmath5",
    "the glauber ( block ) dynamics on @xmath0-colouring has rapid mixing for any @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath12 the chain is expected to be _ non - ergodic_. there is a connected block which contains all but an exponentially small fraction the @xmath0-colourings of @xmath5 .",
    "it is conjectured that restricting the states of the chain to the @xmath0-colourings in this block we should have rapid mixing . ] to our knowledge , there are no predictions for the fugacity as far as the hard - core model is concerned .",
    "however , using the result in @xcite and standard arguments we could conjecture that we have rapid mixing as long as @xmath13 .",
    "these conjectured bounds for @xmath0 and @xmath1 are what we call _ gibbs uniqueness thresholds_.    so far , the best rigorous bounds for monte carlo sampling appear in @xcite ( which improved on @xcite ) .",

    "there are functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that glauber dynamics has rapid mixing for @xmath0-colourings and hard - core as long as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively and @xmath18 for fixed @xmath19 . ]",
    ". however , the values for @xmath0 and @xmath1 that are allowed there are many orders of magnitude off the conjectured bounds . here",
    "we improve on these bounds substantially .",
    "we show that w.h.p . over the underlying graph @xmath5",
    "we have rapid mixing for @xmath20 and for @xmath21 .",
    "that is , we approach the conjectured bounds for rapid mixing only within small constants .",
    "we use the well - known _ path coupling _ technique , from @xcite , to show rapid mixing .",
    "path coupling is also used in both of the previous papers on the problem , i.e. @xcite . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the range of our interest the technical challenge is to cope with the high degree vertices , i.e. vertices of degree much larger than @xmath4 .",
    "the natural approach is to consider block updates rather than single vertex updates for the markov chain .",
    "in particular we use the observation that the effect of high degree vertices somehow diminishes when they are away from the boundary of their block .",
    "devising such a block construction is a complex task .",
    "we introduce for a first time a weighting schema for the paths of the underlying graph which allows a desired block construction .",

    "these weights allow distinguishing which vertices can be used for the boundaries of the blocks .",

    "it turns out that w.h.p .",
    "there is a plethora of break - points in @xmath5 .",
    "this allows creating small , simple structured blocks .    compared to @xcite",
    ", one could remark that our weighting schema allows a more specific characterization of the blocks .",
    "i.e. we have more information about the position of high degree vertices inside the blocks .",
    "somehow , this allows better results from the path coupling analysis .",
    "also , we should mention that our setting for path coupling analysis is closer to @xcite rather than @xcite .",
    "+    * non mcmc sampling .",
    "* in the literature , there are approximate sampling algorithms for both colouring and hard - core model on @xmath5 which do not use the mcmc approach .",
    "usually their efficiency requirements are weaker than those for the mcmc ones . in practice",
    ", this means that we get efficiency guarantees for a wider range of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "however , the approximation guarantees we get for these algorithms are _ weaker _ than what we get for mcmc ones .    in @xcite the author of this work proposes an algorithm for approximate sampling @xmath0-colourings of @xmath5 which has a notable performance in terms of minimum @xmath0 , it requires @xmath22 .",
    "the error of the output is a vanishing function of the size of the graph @xmath23 .",
    "recently sinclair , srivastava and yin in @xcite presented a non - mcmc algorithm for sampling from the hard core - model on @xmath5 for @xmath24 .",

    "a sufficient condition for rapid mixing is the following one @xmath80\\leq 1-\\theta\\left(n^{-1}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to study the technique further , assume now that for @xmath81 we have @xmath82 .",
    "it is natural to use a coupling that updates the same vertex in both copies .",
    "the cases that matter are only those where the coupling chooses to update either the disagreeing vertex @xmath83 or one of its neighbours .",
    "if the update involves the vertex @xmath83 , then we get that @xmath84 .",
    "this happens with probability @xmath85 , where @xmath86 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the update involves a neighbour of @xmath83 , then @xmath79 may have an extra disagreement . in particular , the update of a neighbour of @xmath83 can generate an extra disagreement with probability at most @xmath87 .",
    "since the disagreeing vertex @xmath83 has at most @xmath74 neighbours , the probability of having an extra disagreement is at most @xmath88 . for @xmath89 ,",
    "it is direct that ( [ eq : pathcouplingcritirion ] ) is satisfied .",
    "@xmath5 is of maximum degree @xmath10 .",
    "that is , a vanilla path coupling would require an unbounded number of colours .",
    "otherwise , i.e. if @xmath0 is smaller than the maximum degree , there is no control on the expected number of disagreements generated in the coupling .",
    "however , it is possible to gain some control on the disagreements by using ( appropriate ) block updates rather than single vertex updates . in particular , the blocks should be constructed in such a manner that the high degree vertices are somehow `` hidden '' well inside them .    in our setting , we consider two copies of @xmath69 at states @xmath77 .",
    "the states differ only on the assignment of the vertex @xmath83 .",
    "we have block updates .",
    "the coupling chooses a random block @xmath31 from the set of blocks @xmath52 and updates its colouring in both chains .",
    "it turns out that the crucial case for having ( [ eq : pathcouplingcritirion ] ) is when the outer boundary of @xmath31 is not the same for both chains , i.e. the disagreeing vertex @xmath83 is not inside @xmath31 but it is adjacent to some vertices in @xmath31 .",
    "there , we need to upper bound the expected number of disagreements generated in the update of @xmath31",
    ". the construction of @xmath52 should minimize this number .    to this end",
    ", we build on an idea from @xcite for bounding the expected number of disagreements inside the block .",
    "the authors there use the well - known `` _ disagreement percolation _ '' coupling construction , @xcite , to express the expected number of disagreements in terms of percolation probabilities .",
    "the idea assumes that the block @xmath31 is a tree with at most one extra vertex ( which is the case here as well ) and goes as follows : clearly , the disagreement at the boundary prohibits identical coupling of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the disagreement percolation assembles the coupling in a stepwise fashion , i.e. couples the colouring of each vertex of @xmath31 at a time .",
    "it gives priority to vertices which are next to a disagreeing vertex , if any .",
    "disagreements propagates into @xmath31 along paths from @xmath83 . a disagreement at vertex @xmath92 at ( edge ) distance @xmath93 from @xmath83 propagates to a neighbour @xmath94 at distance @xmath95 if @xmath96 .",

    "+   + the disagreement percolation is dominated by an independent process , i.e. the disagreement propagates over the path @xmath101 that starts from @xmath83 with probability at most @xmath102 .",
    "the number of disagreements is equal to the number of paths of disagreements that start from @xmath83 and propagate inside @xmath31 .",
    "intuitively , high degree vertices are expected to have an increased contribution to the number of disagreements .",
    "i.e. if a high degree vertex is disagreeing , it has an increased number of neighbours to propagate the disagreement .",
    "however , for typical instances of @xmath5 and @xmath20 , it turns out that the larger the distance between a high degree vertex from @xmath83 the less probable is for the disagreement to reach it .",
    "this , somehow , can balance the increased contribution of the high degree vertex .",
    "we exploit exactly this observation in the block construction .    for the construction of the blocks",
    ", we use the following weighting schema : each vertex @xmath103 , of degree @xmath104 in @xmath5 , is assigned weight @xmath105 such that @xmath106 for appropriate real numbers @xmath107 . given the weights of the vertices , each block @xmath54 should satisfy ( among others ) the following two properties :    a.   @xmath31 is either a tree or a unicyclic graph b.   for every path @xmath101 between a vertex at the outer boundary of @xmath31 and a high degree vertex ] inside @xmath31 it should hold that @xmath108    observe that the low degree vertices reduce the weight of the path @xmath101 , while the high degree vertices increase it . restricting the weight of a path between a high degree vertex in the block @xmath31 and a boundary vertex , somehow , guarantees that the high degree vertex is sufficiently far from the boundary .",
    "i.e. so as to keep the weight of the path low we require a sufficiently large number of low degree vertices between the boundary vertex and the high degree vertex . + * where @xmath109 comes from . * so as to derive the bound @xmath110 for @xmath0 we need to show how do we bound the number of disagreements in the update of the configuration of a block . due to its construction , the block has only one vertex adjacent to the disagreeing vertex @xmath83 .",

    "<S> sampling from the _ gibbs distribution _ is a well studied problem in computer science as well as in statistical physics . in this work we focus on the _ @xmath0-colouring model _ and the _ hard - core model _ with fugacity @xmath1 when the underlying graph is an instance of erds - rnyi random graph @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is fixed .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the _ markov chain monte carlo _ </S>",
    "<S> method for sampling from the aforementioned distributions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider _ glauber ( block ) dynamics_. we show a dramatic improvement on the bounds for _ rapid mixing _ in terms of the number of colours and the fugacity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for both models the bounds we get are only within small constant factors from the conjectured ones by the statistical physicists .    </S>",
    "<S> we use _ path coupling _ to show rapid mixing . for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the range of our interest </S>",
    "<S> the technical challenge is to cope with the high degree vertices , i.e. vertices of degree much larger than the expected degree @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the usual approach to this problem is to consider block updates rather than single vertex updates for the markov chain . </S>",
    "<S> taking appropriately defined blocks the effect of high degree vertices diminishes . </S>",
    "<S> however devising such a block construction is a _ non trivial _ task .    </S>",
    "<S> we develop for a first time a _ weighting schema _ for the paths of the underlying graph . </S>",
    "<S> vertices which belong to `` light '' paths , only , can be placed at the boundaries of the blocks . </S>",
    "<S> the tree - like local structure of @xmath5 allows the construction of simple structured blocks . </S>"
