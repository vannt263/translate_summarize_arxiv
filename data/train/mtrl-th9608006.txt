    "the physical properties of rutile - structure oxides are diverse , including insulators ( tio@xmath0 ) , antiferromagnets ( mno@xmath0 ) , good metals ( ruo@xmath0 ) , and metal - insulator systems ( vo@xmath0 ) .",
    "metallic cro@xmath0 , with a curie temperature @xmath11 390k , is the only ferromagnet in this class .",
    "schwarz @xcite used lsda band theory to predict that the spin moment would be the full 2 @xmath1 required by hund s rules for the cr@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) ion .",
    "the fermi level lies in a partly filled ( metallic ) band for the majority ( up spin ) electrons , but for minority ( down ) spins lies in a semiconducting gap which separates the filled oxygen @xmath2 levels from the cr @xmath3 levels .",
    "the situation where one spin species is metallic and the other semiconducting has been named `` half - metallic '' by de groot",
    "evidence of close to 100% spin polarization was seen in both spin - polarized photoemission @xcite and vacuum tunneling @xcite .",
    "however , this polarization was observed not at the fermi energy , but 2ev below .",
    "_ @xcite found good agreement between theory and experiment for the diagonal parts of the optical conductivity tensor , but less good for the off - diagonal magnetoconductivity properties .",
    "these discrepancies have not yet been resolved .    besides the paper of schwarz @xcite ,",
    "lsda band structure calculations have been reported by several other groups @xcite , with similar results .",
    "we repeat these lsda calculations using a plane - wave pseudopotential ( pwpp ) method , and give both a prediction of the frequency of the @xmath14 raman active optic mode of a@xmath4 symmetry and an analysis of transport measurements using band - theoretical parameters .",
    "this work is one of the first illustrations of the ability of a plane - wave pseudopotential technique to do a highly accurate lsda calculation , and the first , to our knowledge , for a ferromagnetic compound .",
    "the electronic ground state for cro@xmath0 is computed using the local spin density approximation @xcite ( lsda ) of density functional theory @xcite .",
    "the form chosen for the exchange - correlation energy and potential is that of ceperley and alder @xcite .",
    "we make the frozen - core approximation in which the core electrons are fixed in their free - atom configuration , and only the valence electrons are allowed to respond to the chemical environment of the solid .",
    "interactions between the valence electrons and ion cores are described by efficient @xcite norm - conserving pseudopotentials @xcite .",
    "the single - particle wavefunctions are expanded in a plane - wave basis set which is well - converged for cro@xmath0 at a cutoff energy of 81 ry .",
    "a worry with the pwpp method is that , because spin - splitting of the exchange - correlation potential is driven largely by the tightly - bound @xmath3-electrons , spin - polarizing effects would be prominent in the core region where the pseudo wavefunctions differ significantly from the all - electron wavefunctions .",
    "however , sasaki , _ et al .",
    "_ , have recently demonstrated @xcite that this is not , in fact , a problem .",
    "while the pseudopotential approach does cause the 3@xmath3 wavefunction to shift in the core region relative to the all - electron case , it also produces a similar shift in the spin - splitting of the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "thus the total energy , which involves integration of the density against the potential , is largely unaffected .",
    "sasaki , _ et al .",
    "_ , have also shown that it is important to employ the partial - core correction scheme of louie , _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in order to reduce core - valence overlap errors introduced by nonlinearity of the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "spin - polarized calculations using this method have been performed for atomic and bulk iron and nickel , and the agreement with all - electron lsda calculations for structural , electronic , and magnetic properties is outstanding @xcite .    to our knowledge , the present study of cro@xmath0 is the first lsda investigation of a magnetic compound using the pwpp method .",

    "figure [ fm_dos ] shows the computed electronic density of states ( dos ) of ferromagnetic cro@xmath0 for majority spins ( positive axis ) and minority spins ( negative axis ) .",
    "these results agree well with earlier dos calculations for this material @xcite . integrating the total dos up to",
    "the total number of valence electrons determines the fermi energy , which is then used as the zero of energy .",
    "the fermi level intersects the majority spin bands near a local minimum in the dos and lies in a band gap of the minority - spin dos .",
    "thus cro@xmath0 is half - metallic within lsda , as was first demonstrated by schwarz @xcite .",
    "this property leads to an integral magnetic moment , which is found to be 2 @xmath25/cro@xmath0 , the value predicted by hund s rules for the spin moment of the cr@xmath12 ion .",
    "the density of majority states at the fermi level is 0.69 states / ev / cro@xmath0 .",

    "[ spin_den](a ) shows that the spin density has the `` cloverleaf '' shape of a @xmath29 function , where a local set of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 axes are used with the origin on a cr atom and axes toward the octahedral o atoms , the axial oxygen defining the local @xmath32-axis .",
    "it is well - known that the crystal field caused by an octahedron of surrounding negative charges splits the @xmath3 states of a transition metal ion , with the three @xmath33 states ( @xmath29 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 ) lying lower and the two @xmath36 states ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) lying higher .",

    "similarly , the broad band from -7 to -1 ev comes mostly from the oxygen @xmath42 states , with a small admixture of chromium @xmath28 character , and is almost identical for majority and minority spins .",
    "the source of the spin density is an exchange splitting of approximately 1.8 ev of the broad bands near and above the fermi level .",
    "these bands are primarily chromium @xmath28 states of @xmath33 parentage , with the @xmath36 bands higher in energy by the crystal - field splitting of approximately 2.5 ev .",
    "the exchange splitting shifts the minority spin @xmath3-bands above the fermi level .",
    "the majority @xmath33 band is two - thirds filled , with the fermi level lying in a `` pseudogap '' in the @xmath33 manifold .",
    "following sorantin and schwarz , we can explain the stability and the shape of the spin density in cro@xmath0 as follows .",
    "only one of the three @xmath33 states participates in covalent oxygen @xmath2- chromium @xmath3 hybridization .",
    "hybridization creates both a bonding and an antibonding hybrid orbital , with the bonding orbital reduced in energy , appearing in the occupied region of nominally oxygen @xmath2 states , and the antibonding hybrid orbital remaining in the chromium @xmath33 manifold , but pushed up in energy relative to the two non - bonding members , leaving the `` pseudogap '' . to see which @xmath33 state hybridizes , consider an oxygen atom with its three coplanar chromium nearest neighbors .",
    "this cr@xmath8o cluster builds @xmath43-bonds from hybrids between the two cr @xmath36 states and two of the three o @xmath2 states .",
    "( this hybridization leaves antibonding @xmath36 states raised in energy relative to @xmath33 states , and is part of the explanation of the crystal - field splitting . )",
    "the leftover o @xmath2 state is the one which points perpendicular to the cr@xmath8o plane .",
    "this state hybridizes by forming a @xmath44-bond with the cr @xmath33 state which is correctly oriented .",
    "this state is orthogonal to the @xmath29 state which lies in the equatorial plane .",
    "thus one half of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 components of the @xmath33 manifold is pushed upward by antibonding , and this explains the dominance of @xmath29 character in the spin density .",

    "[ pm_dos ] .",
    "it agrees fairly well with the lmto calculation of kulatov and mazin @xcite , although they did not find a pseudogap in the chromium @xmath33 band .",
    "note that the fermi level intersects a sharp peak of the dos .",
    "the large dos at the fermi level ( 2.35 states / ev / cro@xmath0/spin ) is an unstable , high - energy situation , which is relieved by the formation of a ferromagnetic phase , according to the usual stoner argument .",
    "the paramagnetic band structure also provides a useful comparison for understanding the electronic transport properties of cro@xmath0 , as is discussed later .",
    "a symmetry analysis of the zone - center phonons of the rutile structure ( space group @xmath45 ) shows that there are four raman frequencies and four infrared - active frequencies .",
    "the raman frequencies belong to irreducible representations @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , whereas one of the ir frequencies has @xmath50 symmetry , with the rest having @xmath51 symmetry .",
    "= 3.2 in    the @xmath46 raman mode is particularly simple , corresponding to fluctuations of the internal coordinate , @xmath23 .",

    "figure [ raman ] shows the variation of the total energy of the crystal as a function of @xmath23 , for fixed values of the lattice constants , @xmath24 and @xmath15 . the solid line passing through the data points is a cubic - polynomial fit to the data , with the zero of energy placed at the minimum . as mentioned above ,",
    "the equilibrium value of @xmath23 is predicted to be 0.3043 . from the curvature of this function at the minimum",

    "the low temperature specific heat @xmath52 was measured @xcite as @xmath10=7 mj k@xmath53 per mole cro@xmath0 . using independent electron theory ,",
    "@xmath54 , this corresponds to an effective density of states @xmath55=3.0 states / ev per cro@xmath0 molecule .",
    "this exceeds our calculated @xmath56=0.69 by a factor @xmath57=4.3 , a large enhancement .",
    "conventional metals have an enhancement @xmath58 from electron - phonon interactions , and it would be possible to have @xmath59 from this source fairly large , perhaps as big as 1 , but not as big as 3.3 .",
    "analogous to the electron - phonon enhancement , ferromagnetic metals can have a mass enhancement from virtual exchange of spin fluctuations . because of the absence of single particle states of opposite spin from the spectrum at the fermi energy , this source is expected to be altered in a half - metallic material @xcite .",
    "perhaps one could patch up band theory in some way , improving the lsda exchange - correlation potentials or making self - interaction or gradient corrections , to diminish the enhancement to a more reasonable value .",
    "however , given the reasonable success of lsda in describing the total energy and the qualitative nature of the spectrum of electronic excitations farther away from the fermi surface , it seems to us more likely that the large specific heat enhancement indicates a correlation effect beyond the reach of a patched - up density - functional theory .",

    "an objection to the procedure used here is that boltzmann theory needs the velocities of the band quasiparticles , while the single - particle energies @xmath81 calculated using lsda band theory are not guaranteed to have any physical meaning",

    ". the resistivity can not be fit with bloch - grneisen curves ; above 200k extra scattering occurs because of fluctuating spins .",
    "if we assume that below 200k electron - phonon scattering dominates , we can still not determine separately all the constants of a bloch - grneisen curve , because at temperatures much less than @xmath78 only a single combination , @xmath85 enters the expression . to get a rough idea",
    ", we make the model @xmath86 and take @xmath78=450k from low @xmath77 specific heat . using the joint up and down spin drude plasma frequency @xmath73=6.96ev @xcite , the bloch - grneisen curve drawn on fig .",
    "( [ ninbres ] ) corresponds to the choice @xmath59=0.27 .",
    "this is a reasonable value , intermediate between the values 0.13 and 0.47 found for the related metals cu and pd @xcite , and agrees with the result @xmath59=0.24 found in the pioneering calculation of yamashita _ et al .",
    ". it would also be reasonable to choose a lower value of @xmath78 , obtaining a correspondingly reduced value of @xmath59 , and a fit which follows the experimental @xmath87 up to a somewhat smaller temperature .",
    "from the measured specific heat and the band values of papaconstantopoulos , one finds @xmath88 , significantly bigger than can be reconciled with resistivity , and suggesting that there is an additional source of renormalization beyond electron - phonon effects .    in principle",
    ", boltzmann theory should still work for ni at temperatures up to at least @xmath77=900k .",
    "if only the electron - phonon mechanism were causing scattering , then the value @xmath59=0.27 implies that the mean - free path for up spin electrons would be 35and for down spin electrons it would be 12 , using the fermi velocities found by papaconstantopoulos @xcite .",
    "however , the actual resistivities , because of spin scattering , are higher by 1.72 than the electron - phonon fit , so the corresponding mean - free paths are reduced to 20and 7 .",
    "but at 900k ni is no longer a ferromagnet , and separate up and down spin fermi surfaces no longer exist . nevertheless , the mean free paths suggested by this analysis are long enough that it seems likely that the basic premises of boltzmann theory are not badly violated .",
    "the fact that @xmath87 continues to increase with temperature at 900k suggests a metal where transport is still governed by propagating quasiparticles which scatter more rapidly at higher @xmath77 .",
    "we now apply this kind of analysis to cro@xmath0 . at low @xmath77 , there are only majority ( up ) spins at the fermi surface , and thus only two electron - phonon parameters , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which can be separately fit to @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "earlier @xcite we found that the high @xmath77 metallic ( rutile structure ) phase of vo@xmath0 was also a `` bad metal '' in the `` exotic '' sense , and also the ferromagnet srruo@xmath8 @xcite , so it should not be surprising if cro@xmath0 is also .",
    "it is interesting to think about the nature of scattering in cro@xmath0 at temperatures near @xmath82 .",

    "a spin flip takes an electron off the majority ( up ) spin fermi surface into an insulating gap .",
    "it can not remain there long unless joined by a sufficient number of other flipped electrons such that the local majority has changed spin direction and the down spins are now metallic with a fermi surface leaving up spins insulating . thus it is easy to imagine that the scattering is not completely incoherent , but has a collective feature .",
    "as temperature rises to near the curie temperature , the bulk magnetization decreases primarily through fluctuating formation of opposite spin domains .",
    "it seems natural to associate the spin - flip scattering length with the size of these domains . above @xmath82",
    "the same picture can be used , except that now the volume fraction of up and down domains is equal . within each domain",
