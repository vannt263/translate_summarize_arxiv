    "besides the fast - tuning of effective parameters , one of the most striking features of superconducting circuits technology is the possibility of reaching the ultrastrong coupling ( usc ) regime between artificial atoms and resonator modes  @xcite .",
    "when the coupling strength is comparable to the subsystems bare frequencies , the qubit and the field merge into collective bound states called polaritons  @xcite .",
    "the fast - growing interest in the usc regime is motivated not only by theoretical predictions of novel fundamental properties  @xcite , but also by potential applications in quantum computing tasks  @xcite .    here ,",
    "in the framework of superconducting circuits , we exploit the physics underlying the dce in order to correlate two qubit - resonator systems exploring the entire range of coupling regimes of the interaction .",
    "first , we extend the numerical results of ref .  @xcite by deriving a semianalytic explanation for the generation of entangled states of superconducting qubits when they are strongly coupled to their respective resonators .",
    "then , we generalize the analysis to include the usc regime , for which we analitically show that a maximally entangled state of the two qubit - resonator hybrid systems is feasible . to prove it , we take advantage of the strong anharmonicity and the parity protection emerging in such coupling regime .",
    "we also consider the deepstrong coupling ( dsc ) regime  @xcite in which , with the proposed scheme , a two - mode squeezed state can be produced for the two polaritonic hybrid systems .",

    "<S> we investigate how the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) can entangle quantum systems in different coupling regimes of circuit quantum electrodynamics , and show the robustness of such entanglement generation against dissipative effects with current technology . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two qubit - resonator systems , which are coupled by a squid driven with an external magnetic field , and explore the entire range of coupling regimes between each qubit and its respective resonator . in this scheme , we derive a semianalytic explanation for the entanglement generation between both superconducting qubits when they are coupled to their resonators in the strong coupling ( sc ) regime . for the ultrastrong ( usc ) and deep strong coupling ( dsc ) regimes , </S>",
    "<S> we design feasible protocols to generate maximally - entangled polaritonic states . </S>"
