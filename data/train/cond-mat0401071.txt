    "it is very well known that diffusion - limited binary reactions in low dimensions may lead to the spontaneous appearance of spatial order and spatial structures , and to associated `` anomalous '' rate laws for the global densities of the reacting species .",
    "for example , the reactions @xmath1 ( some selected references of many in the literature are  @xcite ) and @xmath2 ( again , some of many references are  @xcite ) under `` normal '' circumstances are described by second - order rate laws , whereas the asymptotic rate law for the former reaction is of apparent order @xmath3 for dimensions @xmath4 , and for the mixed reaction it is of apparent order @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "the slow - down implied by the higher order is a consequence of the rapid deviation of the spatial distribution of reactants from a random distribution .",
    "this is in turn a consequence of the fact that diffusion is not an effective mixing mechanism in low dimensions .    to design an experiment in a constrained geometry in order to measure these anomalies",
    "is not at all simple , especially for the mixed reaction  @xcite .",
    "it is simpler for the @xmath7 problem because a number of appropriate non - chemical species can be identified that essentially undergo the simplest annihilation reaction or variants thereof .",
    "examples include exciton annihilation experiments in one - dimensional pores and in effectively one - dimensional polymer wires  @xcite , excited molecule naphthalene fusion and quenching experiments in one - dimensional pores  @xcite , and kink - antikink simulations in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "experimental observations of the @xmath8 anomalies instead generally involve _",
    "reaction fronts_. early on glfi and rcz  @xcite and later others  @xcite recognized that the kinetic anomalies in the homogeneous systems would be reflected in the evolution of reaction fronts .",
    "on the basis of scaling arguments , later made more rigorous , a number of exponents were deduced to characterize this evolution .",
    "the first experiments confirming these results were carried out with species @xmath9 and @xmath10 diffusing in a gel contained in a thin capillary , with one species initially occupying one side , the other occupying the other side , and a sharp front between them  @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments have been carried out in gel - free systems  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the reactant fronts and of the product of the reaction in these experiments both reflect the kinetic anomalies .    in this paper",
    "we extend the front analysis to subdiffusive reactions .",
    "subdiffusive motion is characterized by a mean square displacement that varies sublinearly with time , @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "for ordinary diffusion @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the ordinary diffusion coefficient .",
    "we argue for the importance of this generalization on a number of grounds .",
    "first , there exists a huge literature on systems that deviate from diffusive behavior and are instead characterized by motion all the way from subdiffusive to superdiffusive  @xcite .",
    "subdiffusive motion is particularly important in the context of complex systems such as glassy and disordered materials , in which pathways are constrained for geometric or for energetic reasons .",
    "it is also particularly germane to the way in which experiments in low dimensions have to be carried out .",
    "such experiments must avoid any active or convective or advective mixing so as to ensure that any mixing is only a consequence of diffusion . to accomplish this",
    "usually requires the use of gel substrates and/or highly constrained geometries ( the first gel - free experiments were carried out recently  @xcite ) . under these circumstances",
    "it is not clear whether the motion of the species is actually diffusive , or if it is in fact _",
    "subdiffusive_. indeed ,",
    "a recent detailed discussion on ways to extract accurate parameters and exponents from such experiments concludes that at least the experiments presented in that work , carried out in a gel , reflect subdiffusive rather than diffusive motion  @xcite .",
    "we recently solved the @xmath7 reaction - subdiffusion problem in one dimension  @xcite . to solve this problem , we generalized methods first applied to the reaction - diffusion @xmath7 problem . for the @xmath15 problem the method of intervals",
    "allows an exact formulation in terms of intervals on the line that are empty of @xmath9 particles  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of intervals evolves linearly , and therefore one can find an exact solution . in the reaction - diffusion problem",
    "the description involves a diffusion equation , while the reaction - subdiffusion problem involves a subdiffusion equation  @xcite ; both can be solved exactly . for the @xmath16 problem one",
    "uses instead the odd / even parity method  @xcite , whereby one keeps track of the parity of the number of particles in an interval .",
    "the associated distribution again satisfies a linear diffusion or subdiffusion  @xcite equation .",
    "before these exact methods were developed , it was customary to model these and other binary reactions by writing down a reaction - diffusion equation for each species in the reaction .",
    "such equations typically contain a diffusion term and a binary reaction term , the latter being some truncated form of a two - particle distribution function .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath8 reaction the typical reaction term simply involves the product of the local concentrations of reactants , @xmath17  @xcite . in the @xmath7 reaction one has to be slightly more careful because in writing",
    ", for example , @xmath18 one must be careful not to include spurious self - reaction contributions  @xcite .",
    "once the @xmath7 exact models were developed that did not require one to explicitly write a reaction term , it was possible to analyze the accuracy of the approximate truncations  @xcite . also , it was not necessary to consider the generalization of the reaction term to the subdiffusive case since the exact methods could be generalized directly .",
    "the situation is more complicated for the @xmath8 problem , because no such exact formulations or solutions have been developed in this case .",
    "there is a large literature on the reaction - diffusion problem with different truncation schemes to represent the reaction term , but the literature on the reaction - subdiffusion problem is far more recent and relatively unsettled . in particular , at the current stage of development of this problem it _ is _ necessary to think about how to ( approximately ) model the reaction term .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we present a discussion of the model to be used for the description of the @xmath8 reaction - subdiffusion problem .",
    "having arrived at a particular set of fractional equations .",
    "we apply a scaling theory to these equations akin to that of glfi and rcz  @xcite , but now for a subdiffusive front . to support the theoretical conclusions , it is necessary to perform numerical simulations , which is not a trivial matter for a problem involving subdiffusion . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we discuss our monte carlo simulation methods .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is a compendium and comparison of numerical and theoretical results .",
    "some closing comments are presented in sec .",
    "we start with a system of @xmath9 particles on one side and @xmath10 particles on the other of a sharp linear front , defined to lie perpendicular to the @xmath19 axis .",
    "the particles diffuse and react with a given probability upon encounter . a standard mean - field model for the evolution of the concentrations @xmath20 and @xmath21 of @xmath9 and @xmath10 particles along @xmath19",
    "is given by the reaction - diffusion equations @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the diffusion coefficient assumed to be equal for the two species .",
    "the initial conditions are that @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 . with these conditions ,",
    "no matter the dimensionality of the system , the system of equations is effectively one - dimensional .",
    "the front problem was first analyzed via a scaling description  @xcite and later refined by a large number of authors using more rigorous theoretical and careful numerical approaches  @xcite .",
    "one upshot of the extensive work is that @xmath32 is a critical dimension for the mean field description to be appropriate .",
    "below @xmath32 one must take into account fluctuations , neglected in this description , that completely change the outcome of the analysis .",
    "a particularly transparent argument for this critical dimension was provided by krapivsky  @xcite .",
    "he argued that the reaction constant in the mean - field reaction rate @xmath33 should in general depend on the diffusion constant @xmath23 and the radius @xmath34 of the reacting particles .",
    "dimensional analysis gives @xmath35 , but on physical grounds one expects the reaction rate constant to be an increasing function of the radius @xmath34 .",
    "the conclusion is that the mean field model can therefore not be valid for @xmath36 . while it has been assumed that the mean field model holds for the critical dimensions @xmath32 , krapivsky finds logarithmic corrections that have also been observed in simulations  @xcite . in our analysis and simulations",
    "we will take @xmath32 ( which turns out to be the critical dimension for the subdiffusive problem as well ) and will therefore not deal with the lower - dimensional fluctuation effects . in this first study we will not deal with logarithmic corrections .    in order to generalize the reaction - diffusion problem to reaction - subdiffusion , we must deal with the subdiffusive motion of the particles ( generalization of the first term in eq .",
    "( [ difmft ] ) ) and with their reaction rate law ( second term ) .",
    "we discuss each separately .",
    "subdiffusion is not modeled in a universal way in the literature . among the more successful approaches to the subdiffusion problem",
    "have been continuous time random walks with non - poissonian waiting time distributions  @xcite , and fractional dynamics approaches in which the diffusion operator is replaced by a generalized _ fractional _ diffusion operator  @xcite .",
    "the relation between the two has also been discussed  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the fractional dynamics formulation that leads to the mean square displacement  ( [ meansquaredispl ] ) can be associated with a continuous time random walk with a waiting time distribution between steps which at long times behaves as @xmath37 we adopt the fractional dynamics approach , and comment later on some issues associated with it that must carefully be considered in the context of numerical simulations .",
    "we thus replace eq .",
    "( [ difmft ] ) with the set of reaction - subdiffusion equations @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the generalized diffusion coefficient that appears in eq .",
    "( [ meansquaredispl ] ) , and @xmath40 is the riemann - liouville operator , @xmath41 the reaction term @xmath42 will be discussed subsequently , because certain aspects of the problem are independent of the specific form of this term .      as the reaction proceeds , a depletion zone develops around the front .",
    "this is the region where the concentrations of reactants are significantly smaller than their initial values .",
    "how the width @xmath43 evolves with time is one of the measures typically used to characterize the process . within this depletion zone",
    "lies the so - called reaction zone , the region where the concentration @xmath44 of the product @xmath45 is appreciable .",
    "this concentration profile has a width @xmath46 whose variation with time is another characteristic of the evolving reaction .",
    "the evolution of the production rate of @xmath45 ( which determines the height of the profile of @xmath44 in the reaction zone ) is a third measure of the process . to find these time dependences we adapt the original scaling approach  @xcite to the subdiffusive case , and assume the scaling forms @xmath47 for the concentrations and @xmath48 for the reaction term .",
    "the exponents @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are to be determined from three relations .",
    "the scaling forms are only valid for @xmath52 , that is , well within the depletion zone .",
    "two of the three relations needed to fix the scaling exponents do not require further specification of the reaction term .",
    "since the reaction zone increases more slowly than the width of the depletion zone ( an assumption that ex post turns out to be correct ) , we can focus on the concentration difference @xmath53 to deduce the width of the latter .",
    "the reaction term drops out when one subtracts the equations in eq .",
    "( [ subdifmft ] ) , and its form therefore does not matter at this point . generalizing the procedure in  @xcite , one can scale the resulting equation by measuring concentrations in units of @xmath54 , time in units of @xmath55 , and length in units of @xmath56 , so that the equation is simply @xmath57 and the only control parameter is @xmath58 in the initial condition : @xmath59 the solution is @xmath60 .",

    "when @xmath13 this reduces to the diffusion result  @xcite @xmath62 from eq .",
    "( [ ctperiodica ] ) we see that the width of the depletion zone scales as @xmath63 i.e. , @xmath64 . then , from eq .",
    "( [ abscaling ] ) , the following relation between scaling exponents follows immediately : @xmath65    the second relation follows from the fact that the concentration gradient of @xmath9 and @xmath10 leads to a flux of particles toward the reaction region .",
    "the assumption that the reaction is fed by these particle currents then leads to the quasistationary form in the reaction zone @xmath66 which requires that @xmath67    for the width of the reaction zone to grow more slowly than the depletion zone caused by subdiffusion requires that @xmath68 on the other hand , the quasistationarity condition requires that @xmath69 which again leads to eq .",
    "( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "equations  ( [ scaling1 ] ) and ( [ scaling2 ] ) combined lead to the relation @xmath70 that is easily checked by numerical simulations , since it is determined by the production rate of @xmath45 .",

    "another accessible quantity that is independent of @xmath75 is the location @xmath76 of the point at which the production rate of @xmath45 is largest .",
    "this should occur where @xmath77 , that is , @xmath78 .",

    "there is a varied literature on this subject , based on a number of different assumptions  @xcite .",
    "most do not associate a memory with the reaction term .",
    "some assume that , as in the case of ordinary diffusion , reactions can simply be modeled by a space - dependent form of the law of mass action , e.g. , by setting @xmath82 .",
    "some of these assumptions may be appropriate if the reaction is very rapid , but not if many encounters between reactants are required for the reaction to occur .",
    "we adopt the viewpoint put forth in a recent theory developed for geminate recombination  @xcite but , as the authors themselves point out , much more broadly applicable .",
    "this theory goes back to the continuous time random walk picture from which the fractional diffusion equation can be obtained , and considers _ both _ the motion and the reaction in this framework .",
    "in the context of geminate recombination the authors define a reaction zone and argue that a geminate pair within the reaction zone will not necessarily react for any finite intrinsic reaction rate ( which they call @xmath83 ) because one of the particles may leave the zone before a reaction takes place .",
    "the dynamics of leaving the reaction zone is ruled by the waiting time distribution @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the waiting time that regulates the rest of the dynamics [ cf .",
    "( [ waitingtime ] ) ] , and therefore the reaction rate will acquire a memory that arises from the same source as the memory associated with the subdiffusive motion . in the continuum limit this model then leads to a reaction - subdiffusion equation in which both contributions have a memory .",
    "seki et al .",
    "obtain a subdiffusion - reaction equation which at long times corresponds to choosing a reaction term of the form @xmath86 here `` long times '' set in very quickly if the reaction zone is narrow and the intrinsic reaction rate small . as noted earlier , although the derivation is specifically for geminate recombination , the arguments can be generalized .    our full reaction - subdiffusion starting equations on which the remainder of this paper is based then are @xmath87 from the specific reaction term given in eq .",
    "( [ specific ] ) we can now obtain the third relation between the scaling exponents by balancing the terms within the brackets : @xmath88 simultaneous solution of eqs .",

    "( [ width ] ) , @xmath93 3 .",
    "we carry out our simulations with an equal initial unit concentration of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in this case @xmath94 for all time .",
    "we monitor the number of @xmath45 particles produced at this point of maximum production of @xmath45 , @xmath95 . since @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 this is thus a check on the exponent @xmath51 .",
    "the concentration @xmath98 of each reactant at the center of the reaction zone is difficult to monitor because it is very small and therefore subject to large fluctuations .",
    "instead , we monitor the integral of this concentration over time , @xmath99 with a similar result for the other reactant .",
    "this then is a check on the exponent @xmath49 .",
    "5 .   the width @xmath100 of the product profile grows , according to the scaling equation  ( [ rgamma ] ) , as @xmath101 . according to eq .",
    "( [ thescales ] ) we then have , as a test of @xmath50 , @xmath102 6 .",
    "finally , we monitor the entire profile  ( [ profile ] ) as a function of position and time .",
    "this is a difficult quantity to follow because it involves regions of very low concentration . in a way it constitutes a check of the simulation methodology , as we will see below",
    "monte carlo simulation methods for reaction - diffusion processes are ubiquitous . for a two - dimensional simulation one starts with a square lattice , and deploys a given number of particles at each site according to the initial distribution .",
    "the particles then perform a random walk simulated by the parallel update of the coordinates of all particles at each time step @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "the entire lattice is explored at periodic intervals @xmath105 ( which could and often does coincide with @xmath106 ) , and reactions take place at each site on which there are @xmath9 and @xmath10 particles , with probability @xmath107 . here",
    "@xmath108 is the reaction rate constant and @xmath109 and @xmath110 are proportional to the number of particles of type @xmath9 and @xmath10 on that site .",
    "clearly , @xmath107 must ( in the appropriate sense , since the quantity is not dimensionless ) be small .",
    "there are variants of this procedure that are inconsequential for our analysis ( e.g. , some excluded volume effects ) .",
    "a necessary condition to be in the diffusion - controlled regime described by the usual reaction - diffusion equations is that the random walkers on average perform a large number of steps before reacting .",
    "adjustments that must be made to this procedure in order to describe subdiffusion are neither trivial nor straightforward .",
    "first and most importantly , one can not assume that the particles all jump at the same time .",
    "the distribution of jumping times is now very broad : one can imagine each particle outfitted with an alarm clock , with a jump to a randomly selected nearest neighbor taking place when the alarm goes off , at which time the alarm is reset according to a distribution whose asymptotic behavior goes as in eq .",
    "( [ waitingtime ] ) .",
    "jumping is therefore a renewal process  @xcite .",
    "an example of a normalized distribution with this behavior is the pareto law : @xmath111 the particles are labeled , and jumping times are assigned to them according to this distribution .",
    "these times , from smallest to largest , must be sorted , and the list must be sorted after each jump or reaction .",
    "since the particles no longer jump at the same time , a decision must be made about when they are allowed to react .",
    "there are at least two alternatives : ( 1 ) a reaction attempt occurs only when a particle first arrives at a site ; ( 2 ) reaction attempts occur at each site at periodic intervals @xmath112 , and occur with probability @xmath107",
    ". the first alternative does not seem physically reasonable for the subdiffusive problem since it implies that a pair of @xmath9 and @xmath10 particles that remain at a given site and that did not react upon first encounter will not react no matter how long they remain at the site , which on average is infinite .",
    "they can only react if they move apart and then encounter one another again .",
    "the second alternative , which we choose for most of our simulations , can be associated with a number of physical explanations . on the one hand one can think of reactions induced or activated periodically by some external agent ( a laser , for example ) .",
    "more in line with our thinking of subdiffusion as a way to describe movement in a disordered or glassy or porous medium is to think of this as a mesoscopic description . at a microscopic level",
    "small jumps may occur diffusively , but the motion from one mesoscopic region to another on a longer time scale is much slower because of geometric bottlenecks that affect this longer range movement .",
    "our `` sites '' would then correspond to mesoscopic regions in which a walker can spend a long time moving diffusively from one part of the region to another .",
    "reactions can then take place within one of these regions at regular time intervals .",
    "since the subdiffusive process has a long memory , we must be careful about the initiation of the process .",
    "in particular , it is not appropriate to choose the initial jumping times as indicated above because that would bias the initial condition to one in which all the particles jumped simultaneously at time @xmath113 . instead ,",
    "after this first selection of times we choose another set of jumping times from the distribution , and repeat this procedure a large number of times .",
    "the number of repetitions is usually chosen as the total number of particles initially in the system .",
    "only then do we choose @xmath113 by taking the smallest jumping time as our new origin of time from which the process is launched .",
    "finally , it is noted that even in a diffusive process , reaction events are not really restricted to occur only at periodic time intervals @xmath105 .",
    "a large literature points to the fact that the continuous time process underlying such a step process is one in which times are selected from an exponential distribution  @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the reaction rate constant .",
    "we have also tested this procedure in our subdiffusive system , allowing each pair @xmath116 of particles on one site to react at a time dictated by such an exponential distribution .",
    "if a particle leaves a site before a reaction takes place , the reaction `` clock '' of each particle is reset .",
    "this is also the viewpoint followed by seki et al .",
    "@xcite . note that whereas in the @xmath117 formulation of the reaction events one specifies two parameters , in the exponentially distributed reaction events the reactions are specified by the single rate parameter @xmath115 , which identifies both the reaction rate constant @xmath115 and the mean time between reaction events @xmath118 .",
    "the parameters used in our simulations are as follows : we place two particles initially at each site ( this corresponds to unit concentration for each species ) .",

    "the simulation was carried out on a lattice of size @xmath160 and averaged over @xmath161 runs .",
    "the times are approximately equivalent to those used in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] if the total number of @xmath45 particles in the system is used as a measure of time . ]    finally , in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] we present perhaps the most difficult quantity to capture accurately , namely , the profile @xmath169 defined in eq .",
    "( [ profile ] ) . for these simulations",
    "we use a lattice of size @xmath122 .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the difficulty arises from the fact that it involves regions of very low concentration .",
    "it is instructive to illustrate the difficulty , and that is why we have included fig .",
    "the simulation profiles shown at the different times are actually time averaged over a small time interval around the times shown .",
    "the noteworthy feature is the evolution of the sharp - pointed profile near the origin at short times to a more rounded shape at longer times .",
    "the mean field theory presented in this paper does not produce this rounding , so that it seemed at first that the theory and simulations differed in some profound way .",
    "however , the simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] were carried out with the rate coefficient @xmath123 with reactions occurring periodically at time interval @xmath124 , a reaction rate that turns out to be too high for comparison with our theory . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] we show both the simulation results ( jagged curves ) and those of our theory ( dashed curves ) , now with exponentially distributed reaction events according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : exponential ] ) , with @xmath126 .",
    "the profile near @xmath139 remains pointed for all the times shown , as predicted by the theory .",
    "the quantitative disagreements for long times ( @xmath170 and especially @xmath171 ) are due to finite size effects .",
    "boundary effects are negligible only as long as @xmath172 , and for the long times we find that this is not the case . in our other simulation results",
    "we have not included such results in our averages , but have left them in this figure simply to stress the finite size effects one must be aware of in calculating the behavior of quantities in the depletion zone when the zone extends all the way to the boundaries of the system . to provide accurate results for such long times it is necessary to run simulations on larger systems .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a set of continuum fractional diffusion equations to describe the behavior of a reaction front in the @xmath173 _ reaction - subdiffusion _ problem .",
    "subdiffusion may be appropriate to describe the way reactants move in complex ( glassy , disordered , highly constrained ) geometries , and we were interested in exploring how this constraint on the motion would affect the evolution of a reaction front . because we are working with a set of mean field continuum equations , our results are only valid above the critical dimension @xmath32 .",
    "the subdiffusive motion is modeled via the usual fractional equation that contains the riemann - liouville operator , eq .",
    "( [ lr ] ) .",
    "this choice has a long history , and its virtues and shortcomings are clearly understood .",
    "less clear has been the selection of the local reaction term , and the question of the way in which the memory in the riemann - liouville operator does ( or does not ) affect the way in which the reaction is modeled . while the literature on this subject has presented a number of viewpoints , we argued , in agreement with  @xcite , that the reaction term should also be modified from its usual simple instantaneous product form , at least for small reaction rate constants .",
    "our reaction - subdiffusion model is thus given by eq .",
    "( [ subdifmftfull ] ) .",
    "following the approach of glfi and rcz  @xcite for the evolution of a front in the reaction - diffusion problem , we assumed scaling solutions for the various quantities that can be calculated from the model .",
    "some of these quantities depend explicitly on the form chosen for the reaction term while others do not .",
    "we compared the resulting exponents with those obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "we found very good agreement between the theory and simulations for the exponents @xmath51 and @xmath50 that characterize the reaction term , eq .",
    "( [ rgamma ] ) .",
    "in particular , in terms of the power @xmath174 that characterizes the subdiffusive process we found that the theoretical values @xmath175 and @xmath176 are recovered in the simulations with greater fidelity for larger @xmath90 .",
    "the exponent @xmath49 , governing the time decay of the reactant concentrations as in eq .",
    "( [ abscaling ] ) , is , theoretically , given by @xmath144 .",
    "simulation results give values which correctly follow this trend , but the agreement is not quantitative .",
    "however , we have to remember that the quantity @xmath177 is local and , consequently , it is more difficult to achieve good statistical averages with the small systems and number of particles considered in the simulations .",
    "perhaps the most challenging quantity to capture is the profile @xmath138 .",
    "the theory predicts a cusp at @xmath139 which we were able to capture by our simulations when the reaction rate constant is sufficiently small .",
    "the quantitative agreement between the theory and the simulations for this profile was ultimately limited by our finite system size .",
    "we note that our results are a good example of what is sometimes referred to as subordination in that the subdiffusive scaling behavior can be deduced from the corresponding diffusive behavior with the substitution @xmath178  @xcite .",
    "this work can clearly be pursued along a number of directions . among them",
    "is the description of this same reaction - subdiffusion problem with the usual uniform initial condition for the species , to investigate what sorts of segregation patterns might evolve on the way to extinction , or on the way to equilibration if the reaction is reversible .",
    "another is the study of the fluctuations that must be added to the model in order to describe this process in a one - dimensional system where the mean field description is no longer appropriate , and the possible logarithmic correction in two dimensions that may explain some of our small-@xmath90 discrepancies .",
    "a third is the effect of different subdiffusion coefficients for the species @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and even of different exponents @xmath179 and @xmath180 . in this latter case subordination",
    "would necessarily be more complicated if valid at all .",
    "work along these directions is in progress  @xcite .",
