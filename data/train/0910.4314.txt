    "understanding the qcd phase diagram is one of challenging issues in modern theoretical physics .",
    "a description of the most interesting region of phase diagram at low and moderate temperatures / densities requires a non - perturbative approach , which also provides a proper understanding of the chiral quark dynamics and the confinement mechanism .    until now ,",
    "the only method which is directly based on qcd and which meets these requirements is lattice gauge theory . unfortunately , the application of lattice results to experimental data is complicated by the fact that most lattice calculations are performed with rather large quark masses , leading to unphysically large pion masses .    in the present contribution we want to discuss an effective model of low - energy qcd , capable of describing the chiral as well as the deconfinement transitions . as a basis we use the pnjl model , see e.g. @xcite , which generalizes the well - known nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model for the chiral quark dynamics by coupling it to the polyakov loop , which serves as an order parameter of the deconfinement transition .    to get a consistent picture of the hadronic phase it is important to go beyond the mean - field approximation and to include mesonic correlations . in the present work we suggest an improvement of the pnjl model within strict @xmath0 expansion scheme and",
    "restrict ourselves to the case of zero chemical potential .",
    "the quark sector of the nonlocal chiral quark model is described by the lagrangian @xmath1 ~,\\label{qlagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the current quark mass , and @xmath3 the covariant derivative with a background gluon field @xmath4 .",
    "the nonlocal quark currents are @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry leads to the formation of a quark condensate and generates a dynamical contribution to the quark mass . as a result",
    "the euclidean quark propagator takes the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a ( fourier transformed ) gaussian form factor and @xmath11 is an order parameter for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the chiral condensate is obtained from the non - perturbative part of the quark propagator , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "external vector and axial vector fields can be introduced by a delocalization of quark fields with the help of a schwinger phase factor .",
    "practically , nonlocal vertices with external currents can be obtained by using rules for derivatives of contour integrals .",
    "corrections to the dynamical quark mass beyond the mean - field can be accounted for in a systematic @xmath0 expansion scheme @xcite of the quark selfenergy , @xmath14 ( see fig . [ qucorrection ] ) , and the quark propagator @xmath15    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ fitmodparams2 ]    fig .",
    "[ condensate ] shows that the @xmath0 correction to the absolute value of quark condensate is positive for all sets of model parameters . in the local njl model of ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that this correction is negative .",
    "however , in the local njl model due to its non - renormalizability it is necessary to introduce different regularizations for the pure quark and the meson - quark loops , respectively . in @xcite",
    "a pauli - villars regularization has been used for quark loops and a three - dimensional momentum cutoff @xmath16 for meson - quark loops . in order to study the transition from the local model to a local one",
    "let us construct a nonlocal model with three parameters    1 .",

    "parameter of quark loop regularization @xmath18 3 .",
    "parameter of meson loop regularization @xmath16    the local model corresponds to the limit @xmath19 while the nonlocal model without regularization can be obtained by setting @xmath20 for definiteness , let us compare the local model @xcite with the nonlocal from @xcite with parametrizations fixed in the mf approximation .",
    "note that for the given parametrizations , the mf quark condensates in the local and the nonlocal model agree within less than @xmath21 .",
    "the next step is to consider the @xmath0 corrections and to investigate the role of the mesonic 3d cut - off @xmath16 . for this purpose",
    "it is very instructive to study the ratio of the full quark condensate to the mf contribution @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "[ ratioqq ] we compare the @xmath16 dependence of this ratio for the local njl model as given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( dotted line ) to that of the nonlocal model ( bold solid line ) and its local limit ( thin solid line ) .",
    "it is very interesting that in the region below  1.5 gev these models predict a negative sign for the @xmath0 correction whereas for large mesonic cut - off the sign is positive .",
    "however , in the nonlocal model the absolute value of the correction saturates for @xmath16 larger than @xmath23 gev , which is well above actual parametrizations for @xmath18 and @xmath16 in @xcite .     as a function of the meson cutoff @xmath16 .",
    "local results ( dotted line ) is taken from fig.3a @xcite .",
    "`` local '' check ( thin solid line ) means the local limit of nonlocal calculations and thick solid line is nonlocal result.,scaledwidth=42.0% ]",
    "details of the finite temperature extension of the nonlocal model can be found in @xcite . for the polyakov loop potential we adopt the logarithmic form of ref .",
    "@xcite which has been fitted to the quenched lattice data . in fig .",
    "[ dynmf ] we show the resulting temperature dependence of the quark condensate @xmath24 ( normalized to its vacuum value ) together with that of the polyakov loop expectation value @xmath25 . in the nonlocal model without polyakov loop",
    "the critical temperature for the chiral restoration is @xmath26 mev , whereas the pure gauge sector has a critical temperature for deconfinement @xmath27 mev , fixed from lattice data for @xmath25 .",
    "when coupling the quark and gluon sectors , these critical temperatures get synchronized so that @xmath28 mev at the mf level .      near @xmath30",
    "there is a wiggle in the behavior of the quark condensate which is caused by the perturbative nature of @xmath0 expansion scheme .",
    "namely , in the region of temperatures @xmath31@xmath32 mev the correction to the quark condensate is larger than @xmath0 which one can naively expect .",
    "so , it seems reasonable to use some interpolation between the stable regions at low and high temperatures .    on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath0 corrections slightly lower the temperature of the chiral phase transition in comparison with the mean - field result . for low temperatures",
    "@xmath33 mev our result for the quark condensate practically coincides with the @xmath29 result , whereas the high t region is well controlled by the mean field . near the phase transition",
