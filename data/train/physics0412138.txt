    "atlas inner detector  @xcite is designed for precision tracking of charged particles with 40  mhz bunch crossing identification .",
    "it combines tracking straw tubes in the outer transition - radiation tracker ( trt ) , the microstrip detectors of the semiconductor tracker ( sct ) at intermediate radii with the pixel detector , the crucial part for vertex reconstruction , as the innermost component .",
    "the pixel detector  @xcite is subdivided into three barrel layers and three disks on either side for the forward direction .",
    "the innermost barrel layer is close to the beam pipe at radius @xmath0  mm , the other two layers are at @xmath1  mm and @xmath2  mm . with a total length of approx .",
    "1.3  m this layout results in a three - hit system for particles with @xmath3 .",
    "the main components are approx .  1700 identical modules , corresponding to a total of @xmath4 pixels .",
    "the modules consist of a package composed of sensors and readout - chips mounted on a hybrid .",

    "2@xmath66  @xmath7 in size  @xcite .",
    "the sensor is subdivided into 47,268 pixels which are connected individually to 16 front - end ( fe ) chips using fine pitch `` bump bonding '' either done with pb / sn by izm or with indium by ams .",
    "these chips are connected to a module - control chip ( mcc )  @xcite mounted on a kapton - flex - hybrid glued onto the back - side of the sensor .",
    "the mcc communicates with the off - detector electronics via opto - links , and power is fed into the chips via cables connected to the flex - hybrid .",
    "a cross - section of an atlas pixel module is shown in figure  [ fig : x - sec ] .    to provide a high space - point resolution of approx .",
    "12@xmath8 m in azimuth ( @xmath9 ) , and approx .",
    "110@xmath8 m parallel to the lhc beam ( @xmath10 ) , the sensor is subdivided into 41,984 `` standard '' pixels of 50  @xmath11 m in @xmath9 by 400  @xmath11 m in @xmath10 , and 5284 `` long '' pixels of @xmath12  @xmath11m@xmath13 .",
    "the long pixels are necessary to cover the gaps between adjacent front - end chips .",
    "the module has 46,080 read - out channels , which is smaller than the number of pixels because there is a 200  @xmath11 m gap in between fe chips on opposite sides of the module , and to get full coverage the last eight pixels at the gap must be connected to only four channels ( `` ganged '' and `` inter - ganged '' pixels ) .",
    "thus on 5% of the surface the information has a two - fold ambiguity that will be resolved off - line .",
    "the fe chips  @xcite built in the ibm @xmath14 m technology contain 2880 individual charge sensitive analogue circuits with a digital read - out that operates at 40  mhz .",
    "the analogue part consists of a high - gain , fast preamplifier followed by a dc - coupled second stage and a differential discriminator .",
    "the threshold of the discriminator ranges up to 1  fc , its nominal value being 0.5  fc .",
    "when a hit is detected by the discriminator the pixel address is provided together with the time over threshold ( tot ) information which allows reconstruction of the charge seen by the preamplifier .",
    "during prototyping several prototype modules have been built with two generations of radiation - hard chips in @xmath14m - technology before the production started with the final chip generation in early 2004 .",
    "up to now roughly 200 modules have been built ; in order to assure full functionality of the modules in the experiment , each module will be extensively tested after assembly including measurements at the production sites before and after thermal cycling . moreover",
    ", several modules from different production sites have been tested in a test beam and after irradiation with charged hadrons , the later includes lab tests as well as test beam studies with irradiated modules .",
    "an important test that allows a large range of in - laboratory measurements is the threshold scan .",
    "signals are created with on - chip charge injection for each pixel individually .",
    "scanning the number of hits versus the so injected charge yields the physical value of the threshold of the discriminator and the equivalent noise charge as seen by the preamplifier . a set of such scans",
    "is used to reduce the threshold dispersion by adjusting a 7-bit dac - parameter individually for each channel , a procedure that takes about 1 hour .",
    "the resulting threshold and noise after threshold tuning is shown in figures  [ fig : threshold ] and  [ fig : noise ] .",
    "typically approx .",
    "60  e@xmath15 threshold dispersion across a module and a noise value of below 200  e@xmath15 for standard pixels is achieved , as is needed for good performance .     with a dispersion of 61  e@xmath15 .",
    "[ fig : threshold ] ]    note that there is not a single pixel with threshold lower than @xmath16 .",
    "this shows the high tuning capability of this chip allowing to reach small thresholds on the whole module without any pixel having its threshold too close to the noise , a fact of particular importance after irradiation .",

[",
    "fig : noise ] ]    a measurement of the timewalk , i.e. the variation in the time when the discriminator input goes above threshold , is an issue since hits with a low deposited charge have an arrival time later than those with high charges , in particular for ganged pixels because of their higher input capacity .",

    "the radiation damage is monitored reading the leakage current individually for each pixel . during irradiation the single event upset ( seu ) probability for the triple redundant pixel latches",
