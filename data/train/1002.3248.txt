    "chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars are a- and b - type stars exhibiting peculiar chemical abundances and slow rotation . with effective temperatures ranging between 10  000  k and 15  000  k ,",
    "the late b - type hgmn stars belong to the third group of cp stars defined by preston ( 1974 ) .",
    "they are characterized spectroscopically by large overabundances of hg ( possibly up to 6  dex ; heacox 1979 , cowley et al .",
    "2006 ) and mn ( possibly up to 3 dex ; aller 1970 ) .",
    "overabundances greater than 2  dex of be , ga , y , pt , bi , xe , eu , gd , w and pb are frequently observed in these stars , while he , n , mg , al , ni and zn often are underabundant by more than 0.5  dex ( takada - hidai 1991 ) . the elements c , o , si , s , ca , v , cr and fe usually show only modest peculiarities , with abundances within 0.5  dex of their solar abundances ( classified as `` normal type '' elements by takada - hidai 1991 ) .",
    "hgmn stars rotate slowly in comparison to `` normal '' late - b stars , with @xmath6 .",
    "their average rotation velocity is estimated to be 29  km  s@xmath7 ( abt et al .",
    "these stars present a high rate of binarity : gerbaldi et al .",
    "( 1985 ) estimate that 51% are members of binary systems .",
    "most of these binary systems have relatively small separations , with 41% belonging to sb1 systems , while 59% belong to sb2 systems . some authors ( mathys & hubrig 1995 ; hubrig et al .",
    "1999 ; hubrig & castelli 2001 ) have reported the presence of a weak magnetic fields in the atmospheres of some hgmn stars .",
    "however , attempts to confirm these claims for other hgmn stars have been unsuccessful ( landstreet 1982 ; shorlin et al .",
    "2002 ; wade et al .",
    "2006 ) . in light of the lack of convincing evidence , we assume for the purposes of this study that hgmn stars are non - magnetic objects . because of their high effective temperatures , the hgmn stars should not host hydrogen convective zones in their envelopes , and their low he abundances may reduce the importance of he convection zones as well . indeed , adelman ( 1994 )",
    "showed that hgmn stars have small microturbulent velocities .",
    "atmospheric velocity fields are estimated to be less than 1  km  s@xmath7 for stars with @xmath8 ranging between 10  200  k and 12  000  k ( landstreet 1998 ) ."
