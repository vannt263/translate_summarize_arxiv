    "in this paper i consider the problem of detecting neutrinos from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "recent predictions ( see for example @xcite ) of the diffuse background of neutrinos from the sum of all agn are high enough that water and ice cerenkov detectors under construction such as dumand @xcite , amanda @xcite , lake baikal @xcite and nestor @xcite should be sensitive to muons from the interactions of the neutrinos in the earth @xcite .",
    "most recently , protheroe @xcite has used a new model to calculate the rate of gamma ray and neutrino production in agn jets .",
    "the resulting diffuse neutrino background varies over many orders of magnitude depending upon assumptions made about the relative contributions of various production mechanisms in the agn system .",
    "the minimum estimated flux may be beyond the reach of the current generation of neutrino detectors mentioned above .",
    "i have reassessed the detectability of a wide range of flux predictions using calculations of the neutrino cross sections based on nucleon structure function parameterizations @xcite ( parton distributions ) derived from recent accelerator experiments @xcite .",
    "use of the new parton distributions leads to higher cross sections and a corresponding increased probability of a detectable muon being produced in the rock surrounding a detector .",
    "however , increased neutrino absorption in the earth is an important effect and offsets some of the gains for the longest neutrino paths through the earth .",
    "i present the rates and angular distributions of muons for different agn spectra and for the flux of atmospheric neutrinos @xcite produced when cosmic rays interact with the earth s atmosphere , including neutrinos from charmed meson decay @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "a brief review of the quark parton model and how it is used to calculate neutrino cross sections using accelerator structure function data ( parton distributions ) is presented .",
    "i then examine two of the most recent sets of parton distributions and look at the implications for the total cross sections . finally , i discuss the use of these cross sections to estimate the rates and angular distributions of neutrino induced muons in large detectors , using a monte carlo simulation of the passage of neutrinos through the earth .",
    "this has the advantage of allowing a precise treatment of the effects of neutral current scattering , which reduces the neutrino energies before they finally interact to produce muons .",
    "the prospects for detection of the agn fluxes above the atmospheric backgrounds are then examined .    upon completion of these calculations",
    ", i learned of similar work by gandhi , quigg , reno and sarcevic @xcite , using another recent set of parton distributions @xcite , which yield muon rates consistent with the results presented in this work .",
    "the interaction of a neutrino with a nucleon may be described @xcite in terms of the quark - parton model .",
    "the nucleon is considered to be a collection of quasi - free partons  ( quarks and gluons ) which share the nucleon momentum .",
    "a proton consists of three valence quarks ( up , up and down ) surrounded by a sea of quark / antiquark pairs of all flavours .",
    "the description of a weak interaction of a neutrino ( energy @xmath2 ) with a nucleon ( mass @xmath3 ) in the quark - parton model is described in terms of an interaction of the neutrino with any one of the individual quarks ( which carries a fraction @xmath4 of the nucleon momentum ) . in a charged current process",
    "a @xmath5 boson is exchanged from a muon - neutrino to the quark with the neutrino turning into a muon ( energy @xmath6 ) .",
    "a neutral current process involves the exchange of a @xmath7 boson , with the neutrino remaining a neutrino .",

    "the mrs g parton distributions are valid down to @xmath78 , which is adequate for the calculation of the cross sections in the energy range considered in this work ( @xmath79 gev ) .",

    "note also that i have combined a set of _ next - to - leading order _",
    "( nlo ) parton distributions ( mrs g ) calculated in the @xmath81 renormalization convention with the _ leading order _ ( lo ) form of the structure functions @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the nlo expressions for @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( obtained by convolving the quark and gluon distributions with the wilson coefficients @xcite ) will differ from the lo expressions by terms with coefficients @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the qcd coupling constant , which decreases as @xmath8 increases . in the regions of high @xmath8 ( @xmath86 ) important for the neutrino energies considered in this work @xmath84 has a value of @xmath87 and the resulting differences between the lo and nlo structure functions , and hence the difference in the resulting cross sections , will be small ( @xmath88 a few percent ) .",
    "given the very large uncertainties in the astrophysical assumptions in this work , this is an acceptable approximation .",
    "the total neutrino / anti - neutrino charged / neutral current cross sections obtained by using the fmr and mrs g parton distributions are shown in figure [ crossfinal ] , along with the @xmath89  neutrino charged current estimate by reno @xcite . above @xmath90 gev neutrino and",
    "anti - neutrino cross sections are equal and the fmr cross sections are roughly 1.5 times bigger than the mrs g predictions and 2 times bigger than the reno @xmath89 prediction .",
    "the recent calculations of gandhi _ et al _ @xcite , using the cteq3 parton distributions @xcite , yield a neutrino charged current cross section lower than using mrs g by about 7% at 10@xmath91 gev , with difference rising to 23% at 10@xmath92 gev .",
    "the cteq3 cross section is bigger than the reno @xmath89 cross section by 1 - 10% in the same energy range .",
    "the reported observations @xcite of uhe @xmath93rays from binary x - ray systems in the early 1980s led to predictions of neutrino fluxes from such objects .",
    "the assumption was that protons accelerated in the vicinity of the compact object would interact with other matter in the system to give both neutral and charged pions , the neutral pions decaying to produce the observed @xmath93rays and the charged pions producing a neutrino flux .",
    "calculations were made @xcite of the expected neutrino flux by scaling the models to the observed @xmath93ray flux . however the non - confirmation of the @xmath93ray observations by much larger and more sensitive air shower arrays such as casa @xcite has led to upper limits on the @xmath93ray fluxes that are orders of magnitude lower than the original detection claims , dampening expectation of observable neutrino fluxes from binary x - ray systems .",
    "attention in recent times has focussed on the production of neutrinos in active galactic nuclei , where particle acceleration may be occuring at accretion shocks in the vicinity of massive black holes .",
    "stecker , done , salamon and sommers ( sdss ) @xcite calculated the neutrino flux resulting from interactions of protons with energy above the threshold energy for photoproduction on uv photons ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "szabo and protheroe ( sp ) @xcite included all the subsequent interactions of the protons after the initial photoproduction .",
    "luminosity functions @xcite ( derived from x - ray and gamma - ray measurements - describing the luminosity of agn as a function of redshift ) and the relationship between the neutrino and x - ray and gamma - ray outputs in a given agn model were used to calculate the neutrino output from the sum of all agn in the universe .",
    "more recently stecker and salamon @xcite revised their original model and calculated diffuse neutrino backgrounds for quasar cores and blazar jets .",
    "protheroe @xcite has calculated the neutrino and gamma - ray fluxes from proton acceleration in blobs  of matter in agn jets .",
    "two major production mechanisms were considered .",
    "accelerated protons may leave the blob and interact with the radiation field of the accretion disk ( @xmath95 interactions ) , or interact with each other or with other matter in the vicinity ( @xmath96 interactions ) . the observed time variability of gamma - rays from agn such as mkr421 place constraints on the relative contribution of each mechanism .",
    "the @xmath96 interactions have a long characteristic time scale and therefore can not produce variability of the order of a day .",
    "the @xmath97 contribution , however , can vary rapidly and must be responsible for the time variation . to produce an intensity change of a factor of 2 over a short time scale , the @xmath96 interaction can contribute no more than about 50% to the total output .",
    "the @xmath96 interactions produce the most neutrinos , so the maximum allowable neutrino flux comes from equal contributions of @xmath96 and @xmath97 and the minimum flux from 100% @xmath97 .",
    "the luminosity function @xcite derived from the egret survey and the results from the sas-2 experiment @xcite have been used to produce a diffuse neutrino background estimate .",
    "figure [ agnspec ] shows the resulting neutrino fluxes from a number of different models .",
    "note that the fluxes are multiplied by @xmath98 to reduce the range of the plot .",
    "curves labelled sp ( dot - dashed lines ) are predictions from the earlier szabo and protheroe models .",
    "sdss92  is the stecker _",
    "et al _ @xmath97 flux , while ss95 is the sum of the quasar core and blazar jet contributions in the stecker and salamon model ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the new protheroe model is shown in solid lines for the limiting cases , the minimum expectation coming from @xmath97 interactions only and the maximum from equal contributions from @xmath96 and @xmath97 interactions .",
    "the major backgrounds to searches for agn fluxes come from the decay of kaons , pions and muons produced from the interactions of cosmic rays in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "these fluxes show an angular dependence ; in the horizontal direction the fluxes at the surface are greatest as the kaons , pions and muons traverse more atmosphere and have more time to decay .",
    "the results of lipari @xcite are shown .",
    "another potential background comes from the prompt decay of charmed particles produced in cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere .",
    "the expected neutrino fluxes should have a flatter energy spectrum and not show an angular dependence as the particles mostly decay before they can interact .",
    "zas , halzen and vzquez @xcite have calculated the expected neutrino fluxes from charmed meson decay under various assumptions of the charm production cross section and have computed muon rates in downward looking detectors .",
    "gaisser , halzen and stanev @xcite conclude that model b is an upper limit to the neutrino fluxes in the region @xmath99 tev .",
    "however , model d predicts higher fluxes at lower neutrino energies and gives overall the highest muon rates in downward looking detectors of the two cases .",
    "i therefore use model d to predict the upper limit on the muon rate from charm production . as a lower limit ,",
    "i take the prediction of thunman , ingelman and gondolo @xcite which gives neutrino fluxes nearly 100 times smaller than the zhv model d. it is clear that there is a large uncertainty in the potential contribution of charmed meson decay to the neutrino induced muon fluxes .",
    "the implications of this on the detectability of the agn fluxes will be addressed in the next section .",
    "cerenkov detectors ( dumand , amanda , nestor , lake baikal ) detect upward going muons from charged current interactions of neutrinos in the earth .",
    "the muons can be produced many kilometres from the detector and still survive to be detected via their cerenkov emissions in water or ice .",
    "calculations of the expected muon fluxes from agn @xcite have been made using various parton distributions and muon energy loss assumptions . in their original cross section paper @xcite , frichter , mckay and",
    "ralston calculated the rates of charged lepton production in a cubic kilometre volume of ice and noted that despite the increased attenuation with their new cross section , the increased interaction probability more than compensated for this , resulting in increased lepton production .",
    "in later work @xcite , they calculated the specific rate expectations for a radio receiver in antarctic ice , detecting radio cerenkov radiation from electrons .",
    "the highest of the szabo and protheroe fluxes @xcite and the stecker _",
    "et al _ flux @xcite were used , the results suggesting these fluxes would be readily detectable with a single antenna buried at a depth of 600 metres .",
    "zas , halzen and vzquez @xcite calculated the detection rates of neutrino induced horizontal air showers and underground muons , again for sdss and sp fluxes .",
    "these calculations included the expected rates from charm induced neutrinos .",
    "the cross sections were calculated with the kmrsb-5 @xcite parton distributions which give total cross sections of about the size of the reno @xmath89 estimate .",
    "most recently , gandhi , quigg , reno and sarcevic @xcite ( gqrs ) , have evaluated the cross sections for a variety of parton distributions and have then used the cteq3 parton distributions @xcite to estimate muon rates from astrophysical sources . due to the relative differences in the final cross sections , the cteq3 partons will yield muon rates closer to those using reno @xmath89 than mrs g.    the calculation of muon fluxes induced by neutrino interactions in the earth is complicated by neutrinos undergoing neutral current interactions in the earth ( which reduce their energies but do not remove them from the beam ) before they finally interact to produce a muon .",
    "the final number of neutrinos in a given energy bin after passage through the earth is reduced by both charged and neutral current interactions , but some of the total loss is offset by originally higher energy neutrinos having moved down in energy due to neutral current interactions .",
    "an effective total cross section can be calculated , which is dependent on the original source spectrum .",
    "this approach was followed by berezinsky _",
    "et al _ @xcite where the total cross section was taken as the sum of neutral and charged current cross sections , with a correction term included to account for the source dependent neutral current neutrino regeneration effect .",
    "as an alternative approach to the neutral current effect , i have developed a monte carlo simulation @xcite to model the passage of the neutrinos through the earth , taking into account the relative likelihood of neutral and charged current interactions , and selecting the final neutrino or muon energy from the energy dependent @xmath15 distributions .",
    "a simple weighting system was devised ( and generalized to account for neutrinos that undergo none , one , two or more neutral current scatters before a charged current interaction ) to keep the computing time reasonable .",
    "neutrinos and anti - neutrinos were treated separately using the appropriate cross sections .",
    "the column density of nucleons to be traversed by a neutrino as a function of nadir angle is calculated using the preliminary reference earth model @xcite , which describes how the density of the earth varies with distance from the centre .",
    "the final energy of a muon reaching the detector is determined using the muon propagation code of lipari and stanev @xcite .",
    "the muon energy losses due to bremsstrahlung @xcite , @xmath100 pair production @xcite and photonuclear interactions @xcite are treated stochastically in order to give the correct final fluctuations in muon ranges .",
    "ionization losses are also taken into account .",
    "only muons which are produced within the final tens of kilometres from the detector will actually survive to the detector , so for these calculations i use standard rock ",
    "( @xmath101 g @xmath102 ) for the propagation .",
    "i have calculated the expected muon rates using the cross sections reno @xmath89 , fmr and mrs g resulting from the parton distributions described in section [ partons ] which are derived from the latest accelerator structure function data .",
    "the higher cross sections result in greater attenuation of neutrinos within the earth , but this effect is offset by a greater probability of muon production by the surviving neutrinos in the final kilometres of rock before a detector , leading to greater expected muon rates .",
    "it is important to remember that the effective area of a detector will have an energy and arrival angle dependence and that the overall detection rate will depend upon the energy and angular spectrum of muons incident upon the detector .",
    "for example , the effective area for muon detection ( averaged over arrival direction ) @xcite by the dumand - ii detector ( @xmath103m@xmath104 geometric area ) varies from about @xmath105m@xmath104 at 10 gev ( the array does not trigger on all muons ) up to @xmath103m@xmath104 at 5 tev and goes up to @xmath106m@xmath104 at @xmath107 gev ( the array triggers on muons that pass outside the detector volume ) . the muon rates calculated here assuming a spherical detector with a constant 20000m@xmath104 effective area for all arrival directions and all muon energies will therefore be approximate lower bounds on the numbers of muons detected for muons above about 1 tev ( near the energy at which the effective area equals the geometric area ) . due to the increase in effective area at higher energies",
    ", the muon rates for flatter spectra will be enhanced over those of steeper spectra compared to the numbers presented here which are calculated for an energy independent effective area . keeping this in mind",
    ", we examine the predicted muon rates induced by agn neutrinos .",
    "the integral muon rates expected in a downward looking detector ( @xmath108 field of view ) are shown in figure [ intmuonrates ] for the three different cross sections and nine different neutrino spectra of figure [ agnspec ] .",
    "the predicted muon fluxes span several orders of magnitude .",
    "the sp94 flux exceeds the atmospheric background for a muon energy cut of a few gev . at the other extreme",
    ", the p96p@xmath93 does not exceed the atmospheric background until an energy of around 10 tev . the wide variation in the expected number of muons from charm induced neutrinos is evident .",
    "the tig neutrino flux induces a very low rate of muons , around 1/10 of the lowest agn flux ( p96p@xmath93 ) , and should not pose a background problem at any muon energy cut .",
    "however , the zhv d neutrino flux results in a muon rate exceeding that of the sdds92 flux for muon energies up to @xmath88400 gev , and roughly equal to that of the conventional atmospheric and p96p@xmath93 fluxes at a muon energy cut of 10 tev .",
    "this great uncertainty suggests that there would be difficulties in identifying the origins of any observed muons should the lowest agn flux be correct .",
    "the results presented here are not directly comparable to those of gandhi _ et al _ @xcite , as the neutrino source spectra used in both cases are not identical .",
    "gqrs made a broken power law approximation to the sp94 ( b=1 ) neutrino flux ; this yields muon rates less than the sp94 curve in figure [ intmuonrates ] , which comes from using the highest of the sp94 fluxes .",
    "gqrs also calculated muon rates for the ss95 neutrino flux , but only for the quasar core component , whereas i have used the sum of quasar core and blazar jet components .",
    "also , gqrs treat neutral currents by taking two cross sections : the first the sum of charged and neutral current cross sections , which gives a lower limit to the muon rate ; the second the charged current cross section alone , which will give an upper limit to the muon rate . to check the consistency of the two sets of results ,",
    "i have used the forms of the neutrino fluxes as implemented by gqrs with the mrs g and reno @xmath89 cross sections and find that the muon rates obtained are consistent with the differences in cross sections in the two sets of work .",
    "the sp94 and sp92max fluxes have already been excluded by an analysis of the energy distribution of horizontal neutrino - induced muons in the frjus experiment @xcite .",
    "the frjus detector was a fine grain tracking calorimeter operated deep underground , with the ability to accurately determine the energy of the through going muons from the energy deposited from electromagnetic showering . at near horizontal angles the background atmospheric muon flux",
    "is sufficiently suppressed by the rock overburden to allow a measurement of the rate of atmospheric and agn induced muons . the number of muons ( producing an observed energy loss in the detector greater than the maximum observed energy loss ) expected from each agn spectrum has been calculated @xcite taking into account the rock thickness , muon propagation and the increasing efficiency of the detector with increasing muon energy .",
    "the high fluxes sp94 and sp92max predict more muons than the 90% confidence level upper limit of 2.3 muons and are therefore excluded by this experiment . all the other fluxes considered predict less than 2.3 muons and are therefore not excluded by the frjus result .",
    "the angular distributions of the muon fluxes for muon energies above @xmath109 gev and @xmath110 gev are shown in figure [ muonang103 ] for a collecting area of 20000 m@xmath104 , which corresponds to that of the proposed nine string dumand - ii array .",
    "the increases in the overall muon rates predicted by the fmr cross section are not uniform over arrival direction .",
    "it is clear that most of the increases come from the highest nadir angles ( muons coming from angles 0 to @xmath8830 degrees down from the horizon ) where the thickness of the earth traversed by the neutrinos is smaller and attenuation less important while the likelihood of muon production near the detector is greater .",
    "the rate of directly upgoing muons is very similar for all three cross sections considered - the increased rate of muon production in the final kilometres of rock is balanced by increased neutrino attenuation in the earth .",
    "the increase in muon rates comes from arrival directions where surface or shallow detectors are most susceptible to noise contamination from downward going atmospheric muons mis - reconstructed as horizontal or upward going",
    ". however , deep underwater detectors which are better shielded from atmospheric muons will be sensitive to these increased near horizontal fluxes .",
    "for example , the dumand - ii detector is expected to be sensitive to muons from downgoing neutrinos up to @xmath8820 degrees above the horizon .",
    ".[ratetable]integral muon rates in a @xmath103m@xmath104 downward looking detector for nadir angles @xmath111 ( most upgoing ) and @xmath112 ( nearer horizontal ) for various neutrino spectra , cross sections and minimum muon energies . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      here we consider only those neutrino predictions that have not been ruled out by the frjus experiment .",
    "the total muons expected for nadir angles greater and less than 60 degrees as a function of muon energy cut and cross section for each neutrino source are summarized in table [ ratetable ] .",
    "it is evident that the highest of these fluxes may be observable over the atmospheric background for a 100 gev muon energy cut ( @xmath88300 - 500 events per year above @xmath882000 background ) but that the smaller fluxes ( 10 - 100 events per year ) would not .    for a muon energy cut of 1 tev , the atmospheric background is significantly reduced and the fluxes p96@xmath113 , sp92min and ss95 q+b are now greater than the background and should be observable .",
    "the lower sdss92 flux would produce @xmath8855 - 70 events per year above a 225 background and should be observable over several years but an uncertain contribution from charm induced neutrinos ( @xmath881 - 50 muons ) would complicate matters",
    ". however figure [ muonang103 ] shows that the charm induced muons have a flat angular distribution and this might aid in identification .",
    "the p96@xmath97 is well below the background and given the charm uncertainty , would seem not to be detectable .    moving to a 10 tev cut",
    "reduces the atmospheric background to @xmath885 per year , making all the fluxes readily observable , except for the lower bound of p96@xmath97 .",
    "this latter flux , the atmospheric background and the highest charm decay estimate ( zhv d ) produce roughly equal numbers of muons . given that the charm induced muon rate",
    "could actually be practically zero ( as table [ ratetable ] shows ) , this would make a differentiation between charm induced and agn induced muon fluxes difficult , if only a small excess above the expected conventional atmospheric rate was seen .",
    "one could not simply do a counting experiment as the excess above the conventional atmospheric background could come from either of two sources .",
    "an examination of the angular distributions or differential energy spectra of the detected muons would be needed .",
    "the p96@xmath97 , charm d and conventional atmospheric fluxes produce different angular distributions , shown in figure [ 10tevblow ] .",
    "the shape of the atmospheric neutrino induced muon curve reflects primarily the angular distribution of the source neutrinos .",
    "the isotropic charm - induced neutrinos produce a flatter angular distribution ; but with muons resulting from higher energy neutrinos the angular shape shows evidence of some neutrino absorption .",
    "the muons induced by the isotropic p96@xmath97 flux show a strong angular dependence due to contributions from much higher neutrino energies .",
    "the three angular distributions are quite different for nadir angles greater than @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) . a detector located deep enough such that atmospheric muons are not a problem should be sensitive to these differences , provided enough muons were measured to reveal the angular shape ( requiring many years exposure for a 20000 m@xmath104 detector or a much larger detector ) .",
    "surface or shallow detectors are affected by misreconstruction of downward muons , which restricts their acceptance aperture .",
    "figure [ 10tevblow ] shows that for nadir angles less than @xmath114 ( @xmath116 ) the angular distributions of all three spectra are the same shape ( fairly flat ) .",
    "thus , even using a very large detector / long exposure time but with restricted aperture , the angular distribution alone is not sufficient to determine how much of a small excess of muons was due to agn , because of the large uncertainty in the charm induced neutrino flux .    measuring the energy spectrum of the observed muons may allow a differentiation between source spectra .",
    "the p96@xmath97 and charm d fluxes give equal numbers of muons above 10 tev ; however @xmath8895% of the charm d muons are in the energy range 10 - 100 tev .",
    "the p96@xmath97 muons are split roughly equally between the range 10 - 100 tev and the region above 100 tev .",
    "a comparison of the excesses in each of these energy regions may aid identification .",
    "however , we are dealing with very low count rates where statistical fluctuations and the uncertainty in the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux will also play a role .    as we have just seen , determining the origin of a small excess of muons above the conventional atmospheric expectation relies on looking for angular or energy distribution characteristics .",
    "the p96@xmath97 and charm d spectra produce sufficiently different muon distributions to allow them to be distinguished .",
    "the integral muon energy spectrum ( figure [ intmuonrates ] ) for the p96@xmath117 flux is similar to the charm d muon spectrum , although it produces an absolute level of muons about a factor of 10 bigger .",
    "also the angular distributions for the p96@xmath117 flux have near the same slopes as the charm d angular distributions .",
    "this shows that the higher the contribution from @xmath96 interactions to the diffuse agn flux , the more the muon energy and angular distributions become similar to those from the charm induced neutrinos .",
    "an agn spectrum made up of only 10% @xmath96 and 90% @xmath97 contributions produces a differential muon spectrum with @xmath8885% of the muons ( above 10 tev ) in the energy range 10 - 100 tev , and an absolute level only a few times bigger than the charm d muon spectrum .",
    "this shows that a small observed muon excess showing angular and energy distribution characteristics typical of the charm induced muon spectra could actually be due to a combination of an agn spectrum with a modest @xmath96 contribution with a low overall flux level ( of order of the p96@xmath97 flux given here ) and a charm spectrum lower than the charm d spectrum considered here .",
    "in this discussion i have considered models which produce low numbers of muons in large detectors .",
    "clearly , there will be unambiguous signatures of agn fluxes if the more optimistic fluxes are correct .",
    "excesses well above those predicted by the charm d flux will be clear evidence of an extra terrestrial origin . the p96@xmath97 flux , although of the same level as the charm d flux , has distinctive characteristics ( flatter muon energy spectrum and steeper angular distribution ) that set it apart from the charm induced muons",
    ". however , agn spectra with only modest @xmath96 contributions produce muon distributions with similar characteristics to the charm induced muons . interpreting a small",
    "observed excess of muons above the conventional atmospheric expectation will require a better understanding of the production of neutrinos from the prompt decay of charmed particles in the atmosphere .",
    "in this work i have calculated the expected agn neutrino induced muon rates in large detectors and have compared them to the backgrounds expected from atmospheric neutrinos ( produced by the decay of pions , kaons , muons and the prompt decay of charmed mesons ) .",
    "a monte carlo simulation has been used which correctly accounts for the effects of neutral current scattering and uses cross sections calculated with the fmr and mrs g parton distributions , which were derived from recent accelerator data .",
    "these higher cross sections result in greater muon rates due to a greater probability of muon production in the final kilometres before a detector , but for incident neutrino directions in the 120 degree aperture about the nadir this effect is largely offset by increased neutrino absorption .",
    "the increases in muon rates come from nadir angles greater than 60 degrees , the region where surface or shallow detectors are most susceptible to atmospheric muon contamination .",
    "the very deepest detectors will be able to observe these increased fluxes .",
    "the lowest neutrino flux considered , due to @xmath97 interactions only in the protheroe agn model , would produce roughly 6 muons per year above 10 tev in a 20000 m@xmath104 detector , which is about the same as that expected from the conventional atmospheric sources and the same as expected from the highest estimates from charmed meson decay .",
    "the lowest neutrino induced muon flux due to charmed meson decay gives practically negligible muon rates , which suggests that telling these sources apart may be difficult",
    ". however , the p96@xmath97 agn flux produces muons with angular and energy characteristics that would allow it to be distinguished from the charm and conventional atmospheric backgrounds . on the other hand , an agn flux with around 10% or more contribution from @xmath96 interactions produces muon angular and energy distributions similar to those of the charm induced muons .",
    "an observation of muons seemingly consistent with the level of the charm d flux could actually be due to an agn spectrum with a modest @xmath96 contribution and an overall flux level around 1/10 th of the p96@xmath117 flux , in combination with a charm induced flux consistent with the tig model . a better understanding of the charm production mechanism in the atmosphere",
    "will then be required to interpret such an observation of a small number of muons above the conventional atmospheric background .",
    "this discussion has centred around a possible worst case scenario ( low agn fluxes and uncertain charm fluxes ) .",
    "the larger fluxes considered in this work would be readily observable in a 20000 m@xmath104 detector , using energy cuts of around 1 - 10 tev .",
    "the planned deployments or extensions of the dumand , amanda , nestor and lake baikal experiments should herald the birth of observational extra - terrestrial neutrino astronomy , if the more optimistic agn models and neutrino fluxes considered in this work are near to correct .",
