    "one focus of soil mechanical experiments is the stress evolution @xmath0 for given strain rate @xmath1 and density @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "three striking characteristics being observed at slow , elasto - plastic rates are ( 1 )  rate - independence , ( 2 )  the existence of a critical state  @xcite , and ( 3 )  proportional paths as summed up by the goldscheider rule ( gr )  @xcite .",
    "rate - independence means that if the given strain rate @xmath3 is a constant , the stress @xmath4 is a function of the strain @xmath5 , and does not depend on the actual rate .",
    "the critical state is an expression of `` ideal plasticity . ''",
    "starting from an isotropic stress @xmath6 , and applying a constant shear rate @xmath7 ( @xmath8 denotes the traceless part )  while maintaining a vanishing trace @xmath9 to keep the density @xmath2 constant  a granular system will always go into an asymptotic , stationary state , in which the stress @xmath10 no longer changes with time , although @xmath3 goes on providing a constant rate of deformation .",
    "we shall call this asymptotic state  characterized by the direction of the rate @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 ) and the density @xmath2  the _ critical state_. ( the asymptotic state is more typically arrived at for given shear rate @xmath7 , at constant pressure @xmath13 or one of the principle stress value @xmath14 , rather than the density .",
    "and there are some in the engineering community who insist on restricting the term _ critical state _ to the results of this second type of approaches",
    ". the narrower definition would be sensible if the respective asymptotic states were different .",
    "we do not believe this to be the case , for rather basic reasons , as will become clear in section  [ sec1b ] . )",
    "the goldscheider rule or gr is a generalization of the critical state .",
    "first , it states that a granular system will converge onto the same critical state associated with @xmath11 and @xmath2 , starting from any initial stress , not only an isotropic one . and second",
    ", it postulates the existence of asymptotic states also for cases of changing @xmath2  a point that we believe may be understood as follows : in the principal strain axes @xmath15 , a constant @xmath7 means the system moves with a constant rate along its direction , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "this circumstance is referred to as _ a proportional strain path_. in the stress space , @xmath10 is a stationary dot and does not move . now , adding a constant @xmath18 to the isochoric strain path , @xmath19\\,t$ ] , we need to keep @xmath18 small compared to @xmath20 , such that an initial stress has sufficient time to converge without breaching the random closest or loosest packing  the grains get crushed in the first case , and loose contacts with one another in the second .",
    "then one expects the asymptotic state to be approximately given by the critical stress @xmath21 associated with the same isochoric strain path @xmath22 .",
    "as time passes , the density @xmath2 will change , so will the critical state @xmath21 .",
    "but it will remain associated with @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , gr states that this stress path is also proportional , meaning @xmath23 , @xmath24 also remain constant .",
    "the statements of gr as rendered by kolymbas  @xcite are : ( 1 )  proportional strain paths starting from the stress @xmath25 are associated with proportional stress paths .",
    "( 2 )  proportional strain paths starting from @xmath26 lead asymptotically to the corresponding proportional stress paths obtained when starting at @xmath25 . ( a caveat : although goldscheider is a prudent and reliable experimenter , his data base is rather small  @xcite . )",
    "the initial value @xmath25 is a mathematical idealization , neither easily realized nor part of the empirical data that went into gr .",
    "so we take its core statement as : applying a proportional strain path , there is an asymptotic line to which all other stresses converge .",
    "this stress path is also proportional , such that proportional strain and stress paths form pairs .",
    "barodesy  @xcite is a recent , impressively realistic constitutive model by kolymbas , the originator of hypoplasticity  @xcite .",
    "his purpose is to further improve the quantitative account of granular media s motion , and to reduce the considerable liberty when constructing hypoplastic models .",
    "he did this by starting explicitly from gr . in the present paper ,",
    "we take barodesy ( as specified below , in sec  [ sec2 ] ) , as a constitutive equation with a reduced set of variables , which reflects highly condensed and intelligently organized empirical data , to which the results of gsh are compared .",
    "gsh is a theory of continuum mechanics derived from two notions that we hold to be the basic physics of granular media  @xcite .",
    "when constructing the theory employing general principles , we had little experimental data in mind , and certainly never needed to choose a subset of these .",
    "therefore , if not totally wrong , gsh should be adequate and correct in a broad - ranged fashion . until now",
    ", gsh has shown itself capable of accounting for phenomena as diverse as static stress distribution  @xcite , incremental stress - strain relation  @xcite , yield  @xcite , propagation and damping of elastic waves  @xcite , elasto - plastic motion  @xcite , the critical state  @xcite , shear band and fast dense flow  @xcite .",
    "comparison to barodesy is a further hard test for gsh , especially because any agreement could not possibly have been planned for .",
    "moreover , gsh provides an understanding for gr , and embeds it among the many granular phenomena already understood within the framework of gsh .",
    "finally , we amplify on the point why comparing gsh successfully to barodesy validates the former .",
    "first , we note the qualitative difference between a physicist s theory and an engineering one , which are in fact constructs of different _ raison d^ etre _ : physicists aim to first of all gain a qualitative understanding of a given system , while engineers want primarily to organize and mathematically condense experimental data gained in that system .",
    "when constructing a theory , physicists typically start from some notions about the basic behavior of a system , calling them motivation .",
    "if broadly validated , physicists will conclude these notions are right , considering this a gain in understanding .",
    "two theories with different notions will contradict each other eventually , even if they initially agree with respect to some experiments .",
    "two engineering theories may look very different mathematically , but if essentially the same set of data was used in constructing these theories , they will not contradict each other starkly  though small deviations will generally exist .",
    "an agreement between gsh and barodesy , showing that a theory deduced from some notions , hence quite possibly wildly off the mark , produces results that are seen in experiments , is therefore indeed a validation . on the other hand ,",
    "there are always shades of gray  engineers with a fundamentalist s heart and physicists with a most pragmatic mindset . but all will agree that a mature theory should be both realistic and derived from the specific physics of the system under focus .",
    "we shall in future compare gsh to more constitutive models and experiments on elasto - plastic motion .",
    "recent experiments include uniaxial tests  @xcite , the settlement  @xcite , and systematic triaxial measurements  @xcite , though we do not expect either models or experiments to deviate strongly from barodesy or each other , for the reasons mentioned above .",
    "a recent paper  @xcite stands out , because it connects the constitutive model to particle - level properties .",
    "generally speaking , one needs to heed the cautionary words by schwedes  @xcite , that these setups are typically designed for engineering purpose , and the data may depend on operational details ( such as skill of the experimenters and their level of training ) .",
    "so care has to be taken when adopting their data . a major difficulty",
    ", we believe , comes from the influence of the initial state , from the lack of information on boundary conditions , and from the presence of water ( that gsh not yet considers ) .",
    "dem simulations are nowadays a popular approach employed by both physicists and engineers , see eg .",
    "the best are often qualitatively perfect , but numerically different from experimental results .",
    "therefore , a comparison to gsh requires us to treat them as different systems , with their own values for energy and transport coefficients .",
    "unfortunately , the associated calibration process is time - consuming and laborious .",
    "the essence of granular physics , we contend , is encapsulated by two notions : _ two - stage irreversibility _ and _ variable transient elasticity_. the first is related to the three spatial scales of any granular media : ( a )  the macroscopic , ( b )  the intergranular , and ( c )  the inner granular . dividing all degrees of freedom into these three categories , we treat those of ( a ) differently from ( b , c ) .",
    "macroscopic degrees of freedom , such as the slowly varying stress or velocity fields , are specified and employed as explicit state variables , but intergranular and inner granular degrees are treated summarily : instead of being specified , only their contribution to the energy is considered and taken , respectively , as granular and true heat .",
    "so we do not account for the motion of a jiggling grain , only include its strongly fluctuating kinetic and elastic energy as contributions to the granular heat @xmath27 , characterized by the granular entropy @xmath28 and temperature @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , a phonon , or any elastic vibration within the grain , are taken as part of true heat , @xmath30 .",
    "clearly , there are only a handful of macroscopic degrees of freedom ( a ) , innumerable intergranular ones ( b ) , and yet many orders of magnitude more inner granular ones ( c ) . so the statistical tendency to equally distribute the energy among all degrees of freedom implies that the energy decays from ( a ) to ( b , c ) , and from ( b ) to ( c ) , never backwards .",
    "this is what we call _ two - stage irreversibility . _",
    "accounting for higher densities , when enduring contacts abound and granular jiggling is small , we expand @xmath31 to obtain @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "there is no linear term because @xmath35 is an energy minimum .",
    "( the usual granular temperature @xmath36 , defined as 2/3 of a grain s average kinetic energy , is useful only in the dilute limit , when the fluctuating elastic energy may be neglected , and @xmath37 . ) neglecting nonuniform situations , the balance equation for @xmath28 reads @xmath38 with @xmath39 , and @xmath40 the traceless part of @xmath3 .",
    "also : @xmath41 . the first two term on the right side accounts for viscous heating , the third for the leak of granular heat from ( b ) to ( c ) .",
    "the viscosities @xmath42 and the relaxation rate @xmath43 are parameters of gsh and functions especially of @xmath44 .",
    "we take  @xcite @xmath45 noting that for what we call the _ hypoplastic regime _ of slightly elevated @xmath29 , in which hypoplasticity and barodesy hold , @xmath46 may be neglected . and we neglect @xmath47 , because @xmath48 in all typical experiments . for constant shear rate @xmath49 ,",
    "eq  ( [ 120409 - 3 ] ) is a relaxation equation , with @xmath29 quickly settling into its stationary value , @xmath50 it is then no longer independent .",
    "the coefficients @xmath51 are functions of @xmath2 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the closest packed density .",
    "we stand behind the @xmath54dependence with much more confidence than that of the density , for two reasons : first , there are no comparably general arguments to extract the @xmath2 dependence .",
    "second , probably because of this , the observed dependence is not universal .",
    "the above dependence fits glass beads data , while @xmath55 , @xmath56 seem more suitable for polystyrene beads , see  @xcite .      our second notion , _ variable transient elasticity _ , addresses granular elasticity and plasticity .",
    "the free surface of a granular system at rest can be inclined , or tilted . when perturbed , when the grains jiggle and @xmath57 , the inclination will be reduced until the surface is horizontal .",
    "the stronger the grains jiggle , the faster this process is .",
    "we take this as indicative of a system that is elastic for @xmath58 , turning transiently elastic for @xmath57 , with a stress relaxation rate that grows with @xmath29 .",
    "a relaxing stress is typical of any viscous - elastic system such as polymers .",
    "the unique circumstance here is that the relaxation rate is not a material constant , but a function of the state variable @xmath29 . as we shall see , it is this dynamically controlled , _ variable transient elasticity _  a simple fact at heart  that underlies the complex behavior of granular plasticity . realizing it yields a most economic way to capture granular rheology .    employing a strain field rather than the stress as a state variable usually yields a simpler description , because the former is in essence a geometric quantity , while the latter contains material parameters such as stiffness .",
    "yet one can not use the standard strain field @xmath59 as a granular state variable , because the relation between stress and @xmath59 lacks uniqueness when the system is plastic .",
    "a number of engineering theories divide the strain into two fields , elastic and plastic , @xmath60 , with the first accounting for the reversible and second for the irreversible part .",
    "they then employ @xmath59 and @xmath61 as two independent strain fields to account for granular plasticity  @xcite .",
    "we believe that one should , on the contrary , take the elastic strain @xmath62 as the sole state variable , as there is a unique relation between @xmath62 and the elastic stress @xmath63  if both are related via the elastic energy : shearing a granular system , part of the strain goes into deforming the grains , changing their elastic energy .",
    "the rest is spent sliding and rolling the grains . taking @xmath62 as the portion that changes the energy and deforms the grains , the elastic energy @xmath64 is by definition a function of @xmath62 alone . and",
    "since an elastic stress @xmath65 only exists when the grains are deformed , it is also a function of @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , we employ @xmath62 as the sole state variable , and discard both @xmath59 and @xmath61 . doing so preserves many useful features of elasticity , especially the ( so - called hyper - elastic ) relation , @xmath66 this",
    "is derived in  @xcite but easy to understand via an analogy . driving up a snowy hill slowly",
    ", the car wheels will grip the ground part of the time , slipping otherwise .",
    "( we assume a slowly turning wheel and quickly changing , intermittent stick - slip behavior . ) when the wheels do grip , the car moves upward and its gravitational energy @xmath67 is increased .",
    "if we divide the wheel s rotation into a gripping ( e ) and a slipping ( p ) portion , @xmath68 , we know we may ignore @xmath69 , and compute the torque on the wheel as @xmath70 , same as eq.([1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "how much the wheel turns or slips , how large @xmath71 or @xmath69 are , is irrelevant for the torque .",
    "the functional dependence of the energy density @xmath64 is an input in gsh , as it can not be obtained from general principles .",
    "the one we propose , because we find it both simple and appropriate , is specified below , in sec  [ sec2c ] .",
    "once it is given , so is the elastic stress , for which there is therefore an explicit expression , in terms of the state variables @xmath62 and @xmath2 .",
    "the evolution equation for @xmath62 , as derived in  @xcite , may be divided into that of the trace @xmath72 and the traceless part @xmath73 , @xmath74 comparing them to the fully elastic equation , @xmath75 , we realize @xmath76 is a gear shift factor , as a higher rate is necessary to achieve the same deformation ; while @xmath77 is a dilatancy factor , accounting for the granular phenomenon that a shear flow leads to compression or decompression .",
    "both @xmath76 and @xmath77 are off - diagonal onsager coefficients that depend on @xmath29 , though we may take them as constant in the present context .",
    "the two terms @xmath78 are relaxation terms , accounting for the loss of deformation @xmath79 ( and the associated loss of the stress ) when @xmath29 is finite .",
    "the relaxation rate grows with @xmath29 , and is typically about 3 times as large for @xmath80 as @xmath81 , hence @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "this is how _ variable transient elasticity _ is mathematically encoded . replacing @xmath29 with the shear rate @xmath20 for the stationary case of eq.([eq3 ] ) , we find the above two equations explicitly rate independent . denoting @xmath83 , @xmath84 ,",
    "we take , as tentatively as before , @xmath85 assuming that the plastic phenomena of relaxation , softening and dilatancy are no longer operative at @xmath86 . for a given shear rate @xmath3 ,",
    "eqs  ( [ 120409 - 1],[120409 - 2 ] ) are relaxation equations . denoting @xmath87 , @xmath88",
    ", the system will converge onto the rate independent asymptotic value ( denoted by a superscript @xmath89 ) of @xmath90 and @xmath91 implying @xmath92 and @xmath3 have the same orientation and principal axes .",
    "note also for @xmath93 , the density dependence of @xmath94 cancels .",
    "given the elastic strain @xmath95 and the density @xmath2 , the elastic stress is also given .",
    "for @xmath9 , this is simply the ideally plastic , stationary , critical state .",
    "the elastic strain and the associated stress do not change with time , because the deformation rate and the relaxation cancel , @xmath96 . calculating an approach to this state , starting from an isotropic stress and keeping the @xmath97 constant ,",
    "the resultant curves for @xmath98 and the void ratio @xmath99 ( @xmath100 : grain s density ) , against the strain @xmath101 in triaxial tests ( cylinder axis along 3 ) , resemble a textbook illustration of the critical state , see fig  [ crit - state ] .     and void ratio @xmath102 against the strain @xmath101 in triaxial tests ( cylinder axis along 3 ) , at given @xmath103 and strain rate @xmath104 , for an initially dense ( @xmath105 ) and loose ( @xmath106 ) sample .",

    ", we need the explicit expression for the stress , specified in the next section , sec  [ sec2c ] .",
    "but we can already see the reason for gr s second statement : starting from any initial value @xmath122 , the deviation @xmath123 will , according to eqs.([120409 - 1 ] ) and ( [ 120409 - 2 ] ) , vanish exponentially .",
    "clearly , variable transient elasticity is what lies behind both the critical state and gr .",
    "finally , we note that the cauchy stress , or total stress , @xmath124 is softer than the elastic one , @xmath125 with the same factor as in eqs.([120409 - 1 ] ) or ( [ 120409 - 2 ] ) .",
    "this is a result of the onsager reciprocity relation  @xcite , but it may less formally also be seen as the flip side of the gear shift factor : when a higher rate is needed to achieve a certain elastic deformation , energy conservation requires the restoring force to be smaller by the same factor .    for very high rates  such as present in heap flow or avalanches , the seismic pressure @xmath126 resulting from violent",
    "jiggling of the grains , and the viscous stress , @xmath127 , again of shear rate squared , become relevant and destroy the rate independence .",
    "we neglect both in this paper  though not the viscous granular heating of eq.([eq3 ] ) .      in a space spanned by stress components and density",
    ", there is a surface that divides two regions in any granular media , one in which the grains necessarily move , another in which they may be at rest .",
    "this surface may be referred to as _ the yield surface_. equivalently , we may take the yield surface as the divide between two regions , one in which elastic solutions are stable , and another in which they are not  clearly , the medium may be at rest for a given stress only if an appropriate elastic solution is stable . since the elastic energy of any solution satisfying force equilibrium @xmath128 is an extremum  @xcite ,",
    "the energy is convex and minimal in the stable region , concave and maximal in the unstable one in which infinitesimal perturbations suffice to destroy the state of rest .",
    "yield is clearly a completely distinct concept from the critical state as discussed above  one a static phenomenon , the other dynamic .",
    "the first is a convexity transition of the elastic energy , to be probed by quasi - static motion at vanishing @xmath29 , say by slowly tilting a plate with a layer of grains .",
    "the second is a stationary solution of the relaxation equation for the elastic strain @xmath62 at given shear rate , and relevantly , at an elevated @xmath29 .",
    "it is comparable to the stationary solution of any diffusion equation .",
    "the yield and critical shear stresses are frequently similar in magnitude , but the yield stress needs to be larger than the highest shear stress achieved during the approach to the critical state .",
    "otherwise , the system will abandon the approach and develop shear bands instead , see fig.[stationary - surface - in - paiplane ] below .",
    "many believe that the approach to the critical state is accomplished at low enough shear rates to be considered _ quasi - static_. we contend that a quasi - static motion is one that visits a series of static , equilibrium states , with @xmath129",
    ". the rate of dissipation must be negligibly small .",
    "the rate - independent , hypoplastic motion taking place during an approach to the critical state maintains an elevated @xmath29 that allows irreversible , dissipative relaxation of the elastic strain . in the critical state , this dissipative process , having the same magnitude as the reactive ( ie .",
    "elastic ) deformation rate , certainly can not be neglected .",
    "the elastic energy density @xmath130 is a function of the three independent strain invariants , @xmath131 and @xmath132{u_{ik}^{\\ast } u_{kj}^{\\ast } u_{ji}^{\\ast } } $ ] . for granular materials ,",
    "the following expression is appropriate in many respects , @xmath133and was instrumental in achieving the agreements with all the granular phenomena mentioned above , especially static stress distribution , incremental stress - strain relation , and elastic waves . varying the coefficient @xmath134 , the yield surface changes to resemble different yield laws , including drucker - prager , lade - duncan , coulomb , and matsuoka - nakai , see  @xcite . for qualitative considerations , however , it is frequently sufficient to set @xmath135 .",

    "in comparing gsh to barodesy , we set out to achieve two goals : to validate gsh , and to provide a transparent , sound understanding for gr .",
    "both goals were reached .",
    "gsh is validated because it yields similar results for various key quantities as barodesy , achieving better agreement than would be reasonably expected , without much fiddling with parameters .",
    "conversely , the understanding of goldscheider rules and barodesy comes from the physics of gsh .",
    "the theory has ( for the range of shear rates typical of soil mechanical experiments ) three state variables and two constituent parts .",
    "the state variables are the density @xmath2 , granular temperature @xmath29 ( quantifying granular jiggling ) , and the elastic strain tensor @xmath275 ( accounting for the coarse - grained deformation of the grains ) .",
    "the two constituent parts are first the explicit expression of the stress tensor @xmath276 , a function of @xmath277 that is obtained from the elastic energy ; and second a rate - independent relaxation equation for @xmath275 , derived from the notion of variable transient elasticity . given any initial @xmath278 , the system will always converge onto the stationary solution @xmath279 as prescribed by the relaxation equation .",
    "@xmath279 is a function of the constant strain rate , or equivalently , of the proportional strain path s direction , and may be identified as the asymptotic , critical state for isochoric paths , @xmath9 .",
    "this convergence , a consequence of the relaxation equation , is closely related to variable transient elasticity , and hence a generic aspect of granular behavior .    given @xmath279 and the density ,",
    "the stress is also fixed .",
    "its form , however , depends on the expression for the elastic energy that is material dependent and less robust .",
    "if the strain path @xmath280 is isochoric , with @xmath9 , the asymptotic stress state is a constant of time , but a function of @xmath279 , or equivalently , of the strain path s direction .",
    "as the path varies , the associated stress states lie within a triangle , as depicted in fig.[stationary - surface - in - paiplane ] .",
    "if the shear rate is a sum of @xmath280 and a small @xmath18 , the asymptotic state is ( cum grano salis ) still given by the @xmath279 associated with @xmath280 , though the density will now change .",
    "the asymptotic stress is therefore a function of the same @xmath279 and a changing density , hence no longer a constant . that the stress path is also proportional , that only the magnitude of the stress changes with time , not the ratios of its eigenvalues , is the least robust part of gr , because it depends on the density dependence of certain coefficients canceling .",
    "constructing a constitutive relation , specifying @xmath281 , is only for someone with vast experience with granular media and deep knowledge of how they behave .",
    "derived from two simple notions of what the two basic elements of granular physics are  yields an equivalent account , is eye - opening , and the actually amazing fact of the presented agreement .",
    "a @xmath282 symmetric tensor , e.g. the stress tensor @xmath163 , can be decomposed into two parts : a spatial rotation @xmath283 and a part which is invariant under any rotation . in most analysis",
    "we are interested mainly in the three invariants .",
    "there are usually various ways to represent the invariant triplet .",
    "one of which is @xmath284{\\sigma _ { ik}^{\\ast } \\sigma _ { kj}^{\\ast } \\sigma _ { ji}^{\\ast } } .",

    "@xmath193 is usually called the lode angle of stress .",
    "the angle @xmath194 can be interpreted as a `` friction angle '' ( because it represents the ratio between shear force and pressure ) .",
    "moreover we can also use the three eigenvalues @xmath288 of the stress tensor as an invariant triplet , which are related to @xmath289 by@xmath290where @xmath193 is given by ( [ 120417 - 1 ] ) . in soil mechanics , it is also usual to define the two coordinates @xmath291 in the so called @xmath292-plane , @xmath293inserting ( [ 120417 - 3],[120417 - 4],[120417 - 4 ] ) into ( 120417 - 6a,[120417 - 6b ] ) , we have @xmath294with the help of eqs.([120417 - 0]-[120417 - 7 ] ) we can readily transform among the invariant triplets : @xmath295 , @xmath285 , @xmath288 , @xmath296 .",
