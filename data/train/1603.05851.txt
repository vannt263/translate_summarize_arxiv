    "@xmath5 is is the graph with vertex - set @xmath2 and with edges of the form @xmath6 for all @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "equivalently , since all edges can be written in the form @xmath9 , this is a covering graph over a single - vertex graph having loops and semi - edges , with voltages taken from @xmath3 : the order of a voltage over a semi - edge is @xmath10 ( corresponding to an involution in @xmath3 ) , while the order of voltage over a loop is greater than @xmath10 ( corresponding to a non - involution in @xmath3 ) .",
    "note that we may assume @xmath11 .",
    "a natural generalisation of cayley graphs are the so called _ haar graphs _ , introduced in @xcite by hladnik et al , as follows .",
    "a _ dipole _ is a graph with two vertices , say black and white , and parallel edges ( each from the _ white _ vertex to the _ black _ vertex ) , but no loops .",
    "given a group @xmath2 and an arbitrary subset @xmath3 of @xmath12 the _ haar graph _",
    "@xmath13 is the regular @xmath2-cover of a dipole with @xmath14 parallel edges , labeled by elements of @xmath3 . in other words ,",
    "the vertex - set of @xmath13 is @xmath15 and the edges are of the form @xmath16 for all @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "if it is not ambiguous , we use the notation @xmath17 to indicate an edge @xmath18 of @xmath13 .",
    "the name ` haar graph ' comes from the fact that when @xmath2 is an abelian group , the schur norm of the corresponding adjacency matrix can be easily evaluated via the so - called haar integral on g ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "note that the group @xmath2 acts on @xmath13 as a group of automorphisms , by right multiplication , and moreover , @xmath2 acts regularly on each of the two parts of @xmath13 , namely @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath21 is any bipartite graph and its automorphism group @xmath22 has a subgroup @xmath2 that acts regularly on each part of @xmath21 , then @xmath21 is a haar graph  indeed @xmath21 is isomorphic to @xmath13 where @xmath3 is determined by the edges incident with a given vertex of @xmath21 .",
    "haar graphs form a special subclass of the more general class of _ bi - cayley graphs _",
    ", which are graphs that admit a semiregular group of automorphisms with two orbits of equal size .",
    "every bi - cayley graph can be realised as follows .",
    "let @xmath23 and @xmath24 be subsets of a group @xmath2 such that @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 and let @xmath3 be any subset of @xmath2 .",
    "now take a dipole with edges labelled by elements of @xmath3 , and add @xmath28 loops to the white ( or ` left ' ) vertex and label these by elements of @xmath23 , and similarly add @xmath29 loops to the black ( or ` right ' ) vertex and label these by elements of @xmath24 .",
    "this is a voltage graph , and the bi - cayley graph @xmath30 is its regular @xmath2-cover .",
    "the vertex - set of @xmath30 is @xmath15 and the edges are of three forms : @xmath31 for @xmath32 , @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath16 for @xmath35 for all @xmath7 .",
    "note that the haar graph @xmath13 is exactly the same as the bi - cayley graph @xmath36 .",
    "recently bi - cayley graphs ( and haar graphs in particular ) have been investigated by several authors  see @xcite , for example .",
    "it is known that every haar graph over an abelian group is a cayley graph ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath37 is an abelian group , then a haar graph over @xmath37 is a cayley graph over the corresponding _ generalised dihedral group _ @xmath38 which is the group generated by @xmath37 and the automorphism of @xmath37 that inverts every element of @xmath37 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite considered only cyclic haar graphs  that is , haar graphs @xmath13 where @xmath2 is a cyclic group . in @xcite",
    ", the second and third authors of this paper extended the study of haar graphs to those over non - abelian groups , and found some that are not vertex - transitive , and some others that are cayley graphs .",
    "the existence of haar graphs that are vertex - transitive but non - cayley remained open , and led to the following question .    [ prob2 ] is there a non - abelian group @xmath2 and a subset @xmath3 of @xmath2 such that the haar graph @xmath13 is vertex - transitive but non - cayley ?    in this note we give a positive answer to the above question , by exhibiting an infinite family of trivalent examples , coming from a family of double covers of generalised petersen graphs .",
    "these graphs , which we denote by @xmath39 for any integers @xmath40 and @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are described in section  [ sec : definefamily ] .",
    "they have been considered previously by other authors ( as we explain ) ; in particular , by a theorem of feng and zhou @xcite , it is known exactly which of the graphs @xmath39 are vertex - transitive , and which are cayley .",
    "then in section  [ sec : main ] we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for @xmath39 to be a haar graph , and this provides the answer in section  [ sec : final ] .",
    "let @xmath44 be the generalised petersen graph on @xmath45 vertices with span @xmath41 .",
    "by @xmath39 we denote a double cover of @xmath46 in which the edges get non - trivial voltage if and only if they belong to the ` inner rim ' ( see below ) .",
    "this gives a class of graphs that was introduced by zhou and feng @xcite under the name of _ double generalised petersen graphs _ , and studied recently also by kutnar and petecki @xcite . in both @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the notation @xmath47 was used for the graph @xmath39 .",
    "but it is easy for us to define the vertices and edges of the graph @xmath39 explicitly .",
    "there are four types of vertices , called @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( for @xmath50 ) , and three types of edges , given by the sets + @xmath51    this specification makes it easy to see that each @xmath39 a special tetracirculant  @xcite , which is a cyclic cover @xmath52 over the voltage graph given in figure 1 . to see this , simply take @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and then @xmath55 .",
    "+    [ fig : voltage_graph ]    , title=\"fig : \" ] @xmath1 -36pt @xmath1    we now give some of other properties of the graphs @xmath39 .    every @xmath39 is connected .    clearly",
    "all of the @xmath56 lie in the same component as each other , as do all the @xmath57 .",
    "next , all the @xmath58 lie in the same component as the @xmath56 , and similarly , all the @xmath59 lie in the same component as the @xmath57 .",
    "finally , there are edges between the vertices @xmath58 and some of the @xmath59 , and this makes the whole graph connected .",
    "[ dpbip ] the graph @xmath39 is bipartite if and only if @xmath40 is even .",
    "if @xmath40 is odd , then the vertices @xmath56 lie in a cycle of odd length , and so the graph is not bipartite . on the other hand , if @xmath40 is even , then the graph is bipartite , with one part containing the vertices @xmath56 and @xmath60 for even @xmath61 and the vertices @xmath62 and @xmath63 for odd @xmath64 .",
    "we now consider automorphisms of the graphs @xmath39 .",
    "some automorphisms are apparent from the definition , such as these , which were noted in @xcite : +    [ cols= \" > , < , < , < , < , > \" , ]     it is a straightforward exercise to verify that @xmath65 preserves",
    "the edge - set @xmath66 of @xmath39 , and also preserves the two parts of @xmath39 , given in the proof of proposition  [ dpbip ] . to do the former , it is important to note that @xmath67 mod @xmath68 ( because @xmath41 is odd ) , and hence that @xmath69 mod  @xmath40 when @xmath70 is odd , while @xmath71 mod @xmath40 when @xmath70 is even .",
    "for example , if @xmath70 and @xmath61 are even then @xmath72 .",
    "it is also easy to see that conjugation by @xmath65 takes @xmath73 to @xmath74 , and so the subgroup @xmath2 of @xmath75 generated by @xmath73 and @xmath65 is isomorphic to the semi - direct product @xmath76 . in particular , @xmath2 has order @xmath77 .",
    "also @xmath2 acts transitively and hence regularly on each of the two parts of @xmath39 , and therefore @xmath39 is a haar graph .",
    "combining theorems [ zhoufvt ] and [ thm : main ] , we have the following , in answer to problem [ prob2 ] :    [ thm : final ] @xmath1 +    1 .",
    "if @xmath40 is odd , or if @xmath40 is even and @xmath78 mod @xmath79 , then @xmath39 is not a haar graph , and is vertex - transitive only when @xmath80 + 2 .   if @xmath40 is even and @xmath81 mod @xmath79 , then @xmath39 is a haar graph and a cayley graph@xmath82 + 3 .",
    "if @xmath40 is even and @xmath83 mod @xmath79 , then @xmath39 is a haar graph and is vertex - transitive but not a cayley graph .    if @xmath84 and @xmath83 mod @xmath70 , then @xmath85 is a haar graph that is vertex - transitive but non - cayley . in particular , there are infinitely many such graphs .",
    "the first part follows immediately from theorem [ thm : final ] , and the second part follows from a well known fact in number theory , namely that @xmath86 is a square mod @xmath70 if and only if @xmath70 or @xmath87 is a product of primes @xmath88 mod @xmath68 ( see ( * ? ? ? * chapter 6 ) ) , or simply by taking @xmath89 for each integer @xmath90 .",
    "we discovered the first few of these examples during the week of the conference _ geometry and symmetry _",
    ", held in 2015 at veszpr ' em , hungary , to celebrate the 60th birthdays of kroly bezdek and egon schulte .",
    "the smallest of our examples is @xmath91 , of order @xmath92 , occurring when @xmath93 and @xmath94 or @xmath95 mod @xmath96 ( noting that @xmath97 when @xmath98 ) .",
    "this is also the smallest known haar graph that is vertex - transitive and non - cayley .",
    "it is a kronecker cover over the dodecahedral graph @xmath0 , and is also a double cover over the desargues graph @xmath99 .",
    "these graphs are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "[ fig : smallgraphs ]    , the desargues graph @xmath99 , and the haar graph @xmath100 * f40 * ]    @xmath1 + @xmath1    the graph @xmath91 was known by r.m .",
    "foster as early as the late 1930s , and appears as the graph ` * 40 * ' ( alternatively known as ` * f40 * ' ) in the _",
    "foster census _ of connected symmetric trivalent graphs @xcite .",
    "it was also studied in @xcite by asia ivi weiss ( the chair of the veszpr ' em conference ) , and by betten , brinkmann and pisanski in  @xcite , and boben , gr \" unbaum , pisanski and itnik in @xcite .",
    "it has girth @xmath101 , and automorphism group of order @xmath102 , and it is not just vertex - transitive , but is also arc - transitive .",
    "moreover , by a very recent theorem of kutnar and petecki @xcite , the graph @xmath39 is arc - transitive only when @xmath103 or @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "this implies that * f40 * is the only example from the family of graphs @xmath39 that is arc - transitive but non - cayley .",
    "in fact , * f40 * is the smallest vertex - transitive non - cayley haar graph , in terms of both the graph order and the number of edges .",
    "we found this by running a magma @xcite computation to construct all haar graphs with at most @xmath92 vertices or at most @xmath106 edges , with a check for which of the graphs are vertex - transitive but non - cayley .",
    "incidentally , this computation shows that there are @xmath106 different examples of order @xmath92 , with valencies running between @xmath107 and @xmath108 , but just one of valency @xmath107 , namely * f40*.    finally , there are many other examples of vertex - transitive non - cayley haar graphs that are not of the form @xmath39 , including @xmath107-valent examples of orders @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , and higher - valent examples of orders @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath109 . among the @xmath107-valent examples , many are arc - transitive , including the graphs * f80 * and * f640 * in the foster census @xcite and its extended version in @xcite , and others in the first author s complete set of all arc - transitive trivalent graphs of order up to 10000 described on his website @xcite .",
    "most of these ` small ' examples are abelian regular covers of * f40 * , of orders 1280 , 2560 , 3240 , 5000 , 5120 , 6480 , 6720 , 9720 and 10000 , and are @xmath107-arc - regular , but two others are @xmath10-arc - regular of type @xmath117 with orders 6174 and 8064 , and these are abelian regular covers of the pappus graph ( * f18 * ) and the coxeter graph ( * f28 * ) respectively .",
