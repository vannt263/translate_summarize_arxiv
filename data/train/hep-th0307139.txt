    "gauged supergravities in four dimensions have been the subject of a renewed interest in recent time , especially because of their connection with higher dimensional theories compactified on manifolds which allow fluxes of p - forms along the internal directions .",
    "a particularly appealing class of such theories is given by type iia and iib compactifications on ricci - flat manifolds which , in absence of fluxes , leave @xmath4 unbroken supersymmetries in four dimensions . turning on fluxes develops a scalar potential in these theories , which usually gives moduli stabilization , reduced supersymmetry and , in certain cases , leaves a vanishing cosmological constant @xcite@xcite .",
    "in fact , theories with vanishing cosmological constant are generalized no - scale models , which were studied long ago in the pure supergravity framework @xcite .",
    "another interesting class of models recently studied in the literature is given by compactifications on @xmath5 and @xmath6 of iib orientifolds with three - form fluxes turned on @xcite .",
    "these theories have @xmath7 and @xmath8 unbroken supersymmetries respectively , and the presence of fluxes may give rise to partial supersymmetry breaking @xmath9 with vanishing vacuum energy .    due to the precise knowledge of the moduli space of these theories , an exact estimate of the ( tree - level ) scalar potential is possible in all these models .",
    "the flux - compactifications share the feature that their low energy description is given in terms of an extended supergravity with mass deformations and a scalar potential @xcite .    in the supergravity framework",
    "this can be achieved through the gauging of some of the isometries of the non linear @xmath10-model spanned by the scalar sector .",
    "indeed , the relevant isometries which are gauged in presence of fluxes are those associated to axion symmetries of those scalars coming from r - r forms @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and from the n - s two - form @xmath13 field .",
    "in fact the latter only contributes in the generalized case of orientifolds of @xmath5 where the orientifold projection acts only on some directions of the @xmath5 torus @xcite .",

    "schwarz spontaneously broken supergravity can be shown to be completely equivalent to a gauged supergravity with a non semisimple gauge group given by the semi - direct product of a @xmath14 factor , gauged by the kaluza  klein vector , times axionic symmetries corresponding to isometries in the scalar sector coming from five dimensional vectors @xcite ( see @xcite also for the construction of the five  dimensional gauged supergravity which describes the spontaneously broken model deriving from @xmath15 scherk ",

    "<S> we report on the gauged supergravity interpretation of certain compactifications of superstring theories with p - form fluxes turned on . + we discuss in particular the interplay of duality symmetries in type iib orientifolds and gauged isometries in the corresponding supergravity models . </S>",
    "<S> + turning on fluxes is generally described by the gauging of some nilpotent lie group whose generators correspond to axion symmetries of r - r and n - s scalars .    # </S>",
