    "free convection boundary layer flows near a vertical flat plate embedded in some porous medium are studied for many years and a natural way to describe the convective flow is to look for similarity solutions .",
    "we consider two different sets of boundary conditions for the temperature on the plate : either we prescribe the temperature or we prescribe the heat flux . both cases are leading to the same following third order non - linear autonomous differential equation @xmath0 with the boundary conditions@xmath1or @xmath2the first set of boundary conditions ( [ cond01a ] ) with @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath5 corresponds to prescribed heat on the plate as in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the second set of boundary conditions ( [ cond01b ] ) with @xmath6 and @xmath7 for @xmath5 is for the prescribed surface heat flux as done in @xcite and @xcite . in both cases the solutions depend on two parameters : @xmath8 , the power - law exponent and @xmath9 , the mass transfer parameter .",
    "for @xmath10 we have an impermeable wall , @xmath11 corresponds to a fluid suction , and @xmath12 to a fluid injection .",
    "equation @xmath13 with suitable boundary conditions also arises in other industrial processes such as boundary layer flow adjacent to stretching walls ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or excitation of liquid metals in a high - frequency magnetic field ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we consider a vertical permeable flat plate embedded in a porous medium at the ambient temperature @xmath14 and a rectangular cartesian co - ordinate system with the origin fixed at the leading edge of the vertical plate , the @xmath15-axis directed upward along the plate and the @xmath16-axis normal to it .",
    "if we suppose that the porous medium is homogeneous and isotropic , that all the properties of the fluid and the porous medium are constants , that the fluid is incompressible and follows the darcy - boussinesq law and that the temperature along the plate is varying as @xmath17 the governing equations are @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the darcy velocities in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 directions , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the density , viscosity and thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid , @xmath28 is the permeability of the saturated porous medium and @xmath29 its thermal diffusivity , @xmath30 is the pressure , @xmath31 the temperature and @xmath32 the acceleration of the gravity .",
    "the subscript @xmath33 is used for a value taken far from the plate . in our system of co - ordinates the boundary conditions along the plate are @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 corresponds to a fluid suction , @xmath38 is for an impermeable wall and @xmath39 corresponds to a fluid injection ) .",
    "the boundary conditions far from the plate are @xmath40 if we introduce the stream function @xmath41 such that @xmath42 and assuming that convection takes place in a thin layer around the heating plate , we obtain the boundary layer approximation @xmath43 @xmath44 with @xmath45 let us introduce the new dimensionless similarity variables @xmath46 with @xmath47 the local rayleigh number",
    ". in terms of these variables equations ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ t ] ) become @xmath48 and @xmath49 with the boundary conditions @xmath50 and @xmath51 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath52 and @xmath53 integrating ( [ i1 ] ) and taking into account the boundary conditions ( [ c1 ] ) leads to @xmath54 and the problem ( [ equation])-([cond01a ] ) with @xmath3 and @xmath4 for @xmath5 follows .",
