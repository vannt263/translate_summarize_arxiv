    "investigating the kinematics and the dynamics of galactic systems is one of the classical task of astronomy . to complicate the issue ,",
    "a galaxy is often made out of different subsystems and each one of them has its peculiarities that renders modeling the galaxy a quite difficult task .",
    "along the years , this fascinating challenge has stimulated a lot of astrophysicists to propose a plethora of different models that all share the common feature to be able to reproduce a set of observables suited for the particular kind of system one is interested to .",
    "the surface brightness is the easiest measurable property of a galaxy and is thus the first evidence a _ model builder _ has to take into account .",
    "this explains the large attention devoted to the search for models that , when projected on the plane of the sky , were able to reproduce the observed surface brightness , possibly mimicking the successful @xmath2 law @xcite .",
    "illuminating examples of these kind are the models proposed by jaffe ( 1983 ) and hernquist ( 1990 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that analytical _",
    "simplicity _ is another desirable property of a model .",
    "hence , while it is possible to deproject both the @xmath2 law and its generalization , the sersic @xmath3 profile @xcite , this gives rise to a model @xcite that is too complicated to be indeed useful .",
    "on the other hand , the dynamics of a galaxy may hardly be explained by its luminous components only thus claiming for the introduction of a dark halo whose shape , nature and structure are difficult to determine in a unique way .",
    "the impressive development in processing speed of modern computers have opened the way to more and more detailed simulations of structures formation that turned out to be a valid help in finding realistic and physically motivated models for the dark halo .",
    "actually , also this way is not free of problems mainly because of the unknown effect of numerical convergence and resolution on the asymptotic behaviour of the density profile . as a result",
    ", different simulations do not always give the same results and , moreover , it is not clear how these latter depend on the software used both to simulate the system and to identify bound structures . while there is a general consensus that relaxed systems exhibit a density profile that is well described by a double power law with outer asymptotic slope @xmath4 , there is still an open controversy about the value of the inner asymptotic slope with proposed values mainly in the range @xmath5 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a similar controversy has arisen over the question whether such cusps are indeed observed in galaxies ( see , e.g. , simon et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "however , on galaxy scale , the effect of baryonic collapse and astrophysical feedback processes ( such as supernova explosions ) may alter significantly the dark halo structure thus biasing in a complicated way the interpretation of the observations .",
    "the great variety of models that have been proposed could disorientate giving the impression of a disordered collection of density profiles that are so different from each other that is somewhat surprising that all of them are able to describe the same kind of system .",
    "it is thus highly desirable to look for common features of all these models in order to see whether they are indeed different and independent descriptions of the same kind of system or rather they may be seen as particular cases of a more general family .",
    "a remarkable step in this direction is represented by the @xmath6-models proposed by zhao ( 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "assuming spherical symmetry , the mass density of the zhao models is :    @xmath7^{-\\alpha ( \\beta - \\gamma)}\\ ] ]    with @xmath8 a scale radius , @xmath9 and @xmath10 the outer and the inner slope of the density profile respectively and @xmath11 determining the width of the transition region .",
    "it is indeed possible to show that most of the previously proposed galaxy models ( both cuspy and cored ) are obtained by suitably setting the three parameters @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the zhao models also forms a complete set for constructing general galaxy models or solving poisson equation in the non spherical case .",
    "there is still another possible approach to smooth out the differences among spherically symmetric cuspy models .",
    "qualitatively , we can characterize a model by its asymptotic behaviours for @xmath12 and for @xmath13 . a straightforward way to do",
    "this is to assign the logarithmic slope of the density profile , i.e. @xmath0 . while the usual approach consists in giving the mass density and then evaluating @xmath14 , the inverse way is also possible .",
    "we first choose a general expression for the logarithmic slope and then evaluate the corresponding density profile by a simple integration .",
    "as we will show later , this method allows to reduce most cupy models to some few classes on the basis of the shape of @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , it is worth stressing that @xmath14 may be easily estimated by numerical simulations of structure formation and is less affected by systematic effects difficult to control .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in sect.2 we introduce a general parameterization of the logarithmic slope @xmath14 and delineates four classes of models that are worth to be investigated . in particular , we present in this paper a detailed study of the kinematics and dynamics of models with power law logarithmic slope .",
    "sect.3 is devoted to the estimate of the basic properties : we evaluate the mass density , mass profile , circular velocity , gravitational potential and isotropic velocity dispersion of this class of models .",
    "the dynamical properties are fully characterized by the distribution function and the density of states that are estimated in sect.4 assuming isotropy in the velocity space . in sect.5",
    ", we evaluate the observable quantities , namely the surface density and luminosity weighted projected velocity dispersion , while , in sect.6 , we give off the hypothesis of isotropy and investigate the effect of anisotropy on the radial velocity dispersion and the distribution function .",
    "we summarize and conclude in sect.7 .",
    "the usual approach to modeling galactic systems ( both the luminous components and the dark haloes ) starts from the mass density profile and proceeds by evaluating the main dynamical quantities .",
    "the increasing resort to numerical simulations of structure formations has however drawn more attention to the logarithmic slope of the radial profile defined as :    @xmath15    it is indeed easier to compare different galactic models based on their corresponding logarithmic slope . moreover",
    ", the knowledge of @xmath14 renders quite immediate to study the asymptotic behaviours ( towards the centre and/or the infinity ) of the density profile .",
    "furthermore , it seems that this quantity is better constrained than the density profile by numerical simulations .",
    "motivated by these considerations , it is interesting to look for an expression of @xmath14 that is as more general as possible in order to build spherical galactic models that may be grouped under the same class by mean of the property that they share the same logarithmic slope . to this aim ,",
    "a useful proposal for @xmath14 is :    @xmath16    with @xmath8 an arbitrary scaling radius .",
    "it is possible to show that most of the galaxy models proposed up to now in literature may be obtained by inserting eq.([eq : genslope ] ) into eq.([eq : defslope ] ) and integrating with respect to @xmath1 with the boundary condition @xmath17 after having suitably set the parameters for some popular models . ]",
    "unfortunately , the result we get by letting completely unspecified the above parameters turns out to be extremely complicated involving the exponential of a combination of hypergeometric and trigonometric functions . as a consequence ,",
    "it is not surprising that also the simplest dynamical quantities ( such as the mass profile ) are analytically impossible to derive so that eq.([eq : genslope ] ) is useless for astrophysical applications .",
    "we have thus to look for general , but simpler expressions for the logarithmic slope @xmath14 .    to this aim ,",
    "let us observe that most of the cuspy models frequently used in literature may be deduced by integrating eq.([eq : genslope ] ) with @xmath19 so that , heron , we will restrict our attention to models having the following expression for the logarithmic slope :    @xmath20    let us first consider the case @xmath21 .",
    "without loss of generality , we may set @xmath22 thus obtaining :    @xmath23    if @xmath24 , we may rescale all the results obtained starting from eq.([eq : semigenslope ] ) by replacing :    @xmath25    for @xmath26 , eq.([eq : semigenslope ] ) reduces to :    @xmath27    that may be considered as a generalization of a lot of double power law models ( see table1 in appendix a ) . on the other hand , by setting @xmath28 and @xmath29 , we get :    @xmath30    for @xmath31 , this reduces to the model recently proposed by navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter n04 ) on the basis of a set of high resolution numerical simulations of dark matter haloes .",
    "finally , for @xmath32 and @xmath29 , we may set @xmath33 and obtain a fourth class of models with :    @xmath34    that may be generalized to the case @xmath35 by the following replacements :    @xmath36    summarizing , we have defined four set of models characterized by logarithmic slopes given by eqs.([eq : semigenslope ] ) , ( [ eq : slopeflos ] ) , ( [ eq : preslopepolls ] ) and ( [ eq : linearslope ] ) respectively .",
    "we have checked that , while it is possible to get an analytical expression ( at least , in terms of special functions ) for the density profile in all four cases , the mass profile is analytical only for models with @xmath14 given by eq.([eq : slopeflos ] ) and eq.([eq : preslopepolls ] ) .",
    "our aim here is to study galaxy models that are both general and analytically amenable so that they may be easily compared to observational data ( such as those on the rotation curve ) .",
    "that is why only eqs.([eq : slopeflos ] ) and eq.([eq : slopepolls ] ) are worth to be considered in detail .",
    "moreover , it is easy to show that integrating eq.([eq : slopeflos ] ) gives rise to a class of models that is only a subset of the more general family of the zhao models .",
    "this is partially true also for models with @xmath14 given by eq.([eq : preslopepolls ] ) that may indeed be obtained as a limiting case .",
    "however , the dynamical properties of these particular models have not been investigated in detail by zhao . moreover ,",
    "the result of navarro et al . quoted above is a strong motivation to dedicate much attention to these models which we will refer to in the following as _ polls _ ( _ power law logarithmic slope _ ) models .",
    "the logarithmic slope of the radial density profile for polls models is given by eq.([eq : slopepolls ] ) and is characterized by four parameters , namely the scaling radius @xmath8 , the characteristic density @xmath37 and the two slope parameters @xmath38 .",
    "actually , it is possible to reduce the number of parameters by redefining the scale radius .",
    "to this aim , let us evaluate @xmath39 , the radius at which the logarithmic slope equals the value of the isothermal sphere . by solving @xmath40",
    ", we easily get :    @xmath41    replacing @xmath8 with @xmath39 , eq.([eq : slopepolls ] ) may be written as :    @xmath42    so that the parameter @xmath9 may indeed be eliminated .",
    "it is interesting to look at the asymptotic behaviours of @xmath14 :    @xmath43    @xmath44    the logarithmic slope does not diverge in the centre so that the model is not singular which is a nice feature , while @xmath11 is monotonically decreasing thus suggesting an exponential - like decrease of the mass density .",
    "actually , the density profile turns out to be :    @xmath45 \\right \\ } }   \\label{eq : rho}\\ ] ]    so that @xmath46 remains finite for @xmath12 , which is what usually happens in the case of cored models as , e.g. , the non singular isothermal sphere @xcite .",
    "the exponential decrease of @xmath46 is coherent with the asymptotic limit of @xmath11 for @xmath13 . as a general remark ,",
    "note that polls models , loosely speaking , may be considered as a one parameter family with @xmath10 as ordering parameter and @xmath47 scaling quantities .",
    "a strong constraint on @xmath10 comes from the evaluation of the mass profile :    @xmath48 } d\\xi}\\ ] ]    having defined @xmath49 .",
    "this integral is defined only for @xmath50 giving :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the total mass given by :    @xmath53    and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the usual @xmath56 function and the incomplete @xmath56 function respectively . in fig.[fig : logmass ] , we report the logarithm of @xmath57 for three different choices of @xmath10 . except in the very inner regions @xmath58 , for a fixed value of @xmath59 , the higher is @xmath10 , the higher is the ratio among the mass within @xmath59 and the total one thus indicating that models with higher values of @xmath10 converges more quickly to the total mass .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that @xmath60 converges to 1 only slowly , i.e. for values of @xmath61 for the models we have considered . as a result , the scaled half mass radius @xmath62 , implicitly defined as @xmath63 , turns out to be quite large . for instance , for the n04 model it is @xmath64 , while for @xmath65 @xmath62 is well approximated ( within @xmath66 ) as :    @xmath67    as we have checked numerically . as regard the total mass ,",
    "this is decreasing function of the slope parameter @xmath10 as it is shown in fig.[fig : totmass ] .",
    "qualitatively , this can be explained by noting that models with higher @xmath10 are more concentrated ( i.e. the density decreases faster ) so that less mass is contained within a given volume with the result that @xmath52 is smaller .",
    "being the model spherically symmetric , we do not need to explicitly compute the gravitational potential to evaluate the rotation curve .",
    "it is simply :    @xmath68    that , in our case , reduces to :    @xmath69    having defined :    @xmath70 } \\",
    ", \\label{eq : vs}\\ ] ]    @xmath71    looking at fig.[fig : vcfig ] , where the normalized normalized velocity @xmath72 is shown , we see that higher values of @xmath10 gives rise to higher peak velocities .",
    "the position @xmath73 of the peak is a function of @xmath10 and is well approximated ( within @xmath66 ) as :    @xmath74    for the n04 model , it is @xmath75 , while models with lower @xmath10 peaks farther from the galaxy centre .",
    "the rotation curve is asymptotically keplerian . indeed , for @xmath76 , @xmath77 so that the fractionary term in eq.([eq : vcfun ] ) goes to unity and the keplerian term @xmath78 dominates .",
    "actually , this is an obvious consequence of the finite total mass of the model .",
    "note , however , that the keplerian behaviour is attained only for large values of @xmath59 so that @xmath79 is quite slowly declining and , within the observational errors , may be also compatible with a flat rotation curve .",
    "let us now derive the gravitational potential for polls models . to this aim ,",
    "the poisson equation :    @xmath80    has to be solved . for spherically symmetric system , the general solution is @xcite :    @xmath81    using eq.([eq : mass ] ) for the mass profile and eq.([eq : rho ] ) for the density law , we get :    @xmath82    with :    @xmath83    @xmath84    being the total mass finite , eq.([eq : genphi ] ) easily shows that the gravitational potential vanishes at infinity .",
    "however , a caveat is in order here . if we consider the limit for @xmath76 of eq.([eq : phi ] ) , we find @xmath85 .",
    "since the potential is defined by eq.([eq : genphi ] ) up to an arbitrary additive constant , we could add this value to eq.([eq : phi ] ) in order to have @xmath86 vanishing at infinity as it is indeed the case . at the opposite end , having the model a finite force at the centre , the gravitational potential does not diverge in the origin . by applying the limit for @xmath87 in eq.([eq : phi ] ) , we get :    @xmath88    which is plotted in fig.[fig : phiz ] .",
    "the central potential turns out to be an increasing report @xmath89 so that a monotonically decreasing curve means an increasing central potential . ]",
    "function of the slope parameter @xmath10 . as a consequence ,",
    "the depth of the potential well is greater for larger values of @xmath10 and , for these models , particles are more attracted toward the centre .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath59 , the gravitational force and hence the number of stars within a distance @xmath59 from the centre is larger for larger values of @xmath10 thus explaining why @xmath90 is an increasing function of the slope parameter .",
    "another dynamically interesting quantity that may be straightforwardly evaluated is the velocity dispersion .",
    "assuming isotropy in the velocity space , this is given by @xcite :    @xmath91    inserting eqs.([eq : rho ] ) and ( [ eq : mass ] ) into the above general expression , we get :    @xmath92    with    @xmath93   { \\rm e}^{-(2/\\gamma ) \\xi^{\\gamma } } \\xi^{-2 } d\\xi } \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : defisig}\\ ] ]    this quantity may not be evaluated analytically , but it is straightforward to estimate numerically for fixed values of the slope parameter @xmath10 .",
    "fig.[fig : sigfig ] shows the velocity dispersion for three values of @xmath10 using @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the result may be simply scaled to other values of @xmath96 by noting that , because of eq.([eq : sigma ] ) , @xmath97 . as yet observed for the rotational velocity , for a given @xmath59",
    ", @xmath98 is higher for higher values of @xmath10 . in both cases",
    ", we have thus a degeneracy between the total mass and the slope parameter since both these quantities increase @xmath79 and @xmath98",
    ". however , the degeneracy may be broken by determining where the rotation curve peaks since this only depends on @xmath10 . as a further remark",
    ", we note that @xmath98 decreases in the outer regions of the system thus mimicking well what has been recently observed in intermediate luminosity elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "all the kinematical information on a collisionless system may be derived by the phase space distribution function ( hereafter df ) @xmath99 that , for a non rotating spherically symmetric isotropic system , depends only on the binding energy for unit mass . following binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) ,",
    "we define :    @xmath100    and set @xmath101 so that the df vanishes for @xmath102 .",
    "the df may then be obtained by means of the eddington formula @xcite :    @xmath103    in principle , one should express @xmath46 as function of @xmath104 by first inverting the relation @xmath105 .",
    "unfortunately , eq.([eq : phi ] ) may not be inverted analytically so that we have to resort to a different approach changing variable from @xmath104 to @xmath59 in the above eddington formula .",

    "the dimensionless energy @xmath109 ranges between @xmath110 and @xmath111 that , in our case , reduces to @xmath112 with @xmath113 given by eq.([eq : phizero ] ) . for values of @xmath109 in this range",
    ", we may numerically determine the df of the polls models by first setting the value of the slope parameter @xmath10 , then solving eq.([eq : solxi ] ) with respect to @xmath114 and finally using eq.([eq : eddfor ] ) .",
    "a caveat is in order here . for @xmath109 running in its range , @xmath59 changes between @xmath115 and @xmath116",
    "actually , when numerically solving eq.([eq : solxi ] ) , there are technical problems approaching the lower and upper ends of the range for the dimensionless binding energy . as a consequence ,",
    "we compute the df only over a limited range .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : dfgamma ] where we plot the logarithm of the reduced df defined as :    @xmath117    it is worth noting that the reduced df is well approximated by a single power law for a large range of values of the binding energy @xmath109 .",
    "this is apparent from fig.[fig : dfgamma ] where the logarithm of the reduced df turns out to be a linear function of @xmath118 for @xmath118 .",
    "however , both the exponent of the power law ( i.e. , the slope of the linear part of the plot ) and the range over which this approximation works sufficiently well depend in a complicated way on the parameter @xmath10 . in particular , the range over which the reduced df is a power law reduces with increasing @xmath10 . as a general remark",
    ", we note that the shape of the logarithm of the reduced df is the same for different values of @xmath10 with a linear part followed by a steep increase .",
    "in particular , for a fixed value of @xmath109 , the higher is @xmath10 , the larger is the reduced df .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that the power law approximation does not hold at the low and high energy limits .",
    "actually , for @xmath109 approaching @xmath111 , the df diverges ( as shown by the steep increase in fig.[fig : dfgamma ] ) and the divergence is strongest for smaller @xmath10 . on the other hand , @xmath119 drops to zero much steeper than a power law for @xmath120 ( not shown in the plot ) , but , unfortunately , we have been unable to find an approximated formula relating the steepness of the decrease with the slope parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the df is a useful quantity , but does not tell anything about the number of stars per unit binding energy . the quantity that gives this information is the differential energy distribution @xmath121 that , for an isotropic and spherically symmetric system , may be written as @xmath122 . since we have yet determined the df , computing the differential energy distribution reduces to the evaluation of @xmath123 , that is the density of states per unit binding energy given by @xcite :    @xmath124    since @xmath104 is a monotonic decreasing function of @xmath1 , @xmath125 everywhere and we can rewrite the above relation as :    @xmath126    with @xmath114 the same as in eq.([eq : solxi ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to define a dimensionless reduced density of states as :    @xmath127    as is shown in fig.[fig : dngamma ] , the density of states may be approximated as a power law over a large range of @xmath109 as yet observed for the reduced df , but now the slope is negative coherently with what is expected .",
    "the dependence on @xmath10 is similar to that of the reduced df with the only difference that the reduced density of states is a decreasing rather than an increasing function of the binding energy .",
    "finally , we show in fig.[fig : diffen ] the differential energy distribution by plotting the logarithm of the reduced quantity :    @xmath128    @xmath129 turns out to be a decreasing function of the binding energy well approximated by a single power law ( i.e. a linear fit in logarithmic space ) over almost the full range of @xmath130 .",
    "the abrupt cutoff at high binding energies may be qualitatively explained by noting that high values of @xmath130 are reached in the centre of the mass distribution where the density takes a finite value . as a result",
    ", the differential energy distribution may not go down forever , but has to be truncated . at the other extreme ,",
    "since the mass density formally vanishes only at infinity , it is always possible to find stars at larger and larger distances with lower and lower binding energies so that @xmath131 may diverge for @xmath130 going to zero .",
    "this behaviour is apparently opposed to what is shown in fig.[fig : diffen ] where a divergence appears only for the model with @xmath132 , while the @xmath133 is approximately constant for @xmath134 and decreasing for @xmath135 .",
    "however , we have checked that these unexpected behaviours are the result of numerical problems originating for low values of the binding energy .",
    "the density law in eq.([eq : rho ] ) is a generalization of the n04 model that has been proposed to describe the dark haloes coming out from high resolution numerical simulations .",
    "actually , there is no a priori reason against using polls models to describe also the luminous components of galaxies ( in particular , ellipticals and bulges of spiral galaxies ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to ask what is the surface mass density of these models since this may compared with the surface brightness .",
    "moreover , this quantity directly enters the study of the lensing properties of a given model .",
    "it is thus worth computing the surface density of polls models starting from the definition :    @xmath136    with @xmath137 the distance from the centre in the equatorial plane of the system . by inserting eq.([eq : rho ] ) into the above relation , we get :    @xmath138    with @xmath139 and we have defined :    @xmath140    @xmath141    @xmath142 may not be evaluated analytically , but it is straightforward to compute numerically for fixed value of the slope parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : surf ] where we use a logarithmic scale to make easier the visualization .",
    "it is worth noting that the slope parameter @xmath10 plays a key role in determining the behaviour of @xmath143 in the inner regions , while has a still significant but less dramatic effect for large values of @xmath144 . in particular , we find that the higher is @xmath10 , the lower is the surface density for a given @xmath59 .",
    "this is particularly evident in the very inner regions as it is seen comparing the flat part of the curves in fig.[fig : surf ] .",
    "it is worth stressing that the surface density may not mimic neither the usual @xmath2 law nor its generalization @xmath3 .",
    "this is not a serious drawback of polls models , however , since they were introduced to describe dark haloes rather than luminous components .",
    "it is nonetheless interesting to compute also the integrated surface density that is given as :    @xmath145    that is shown in fig.[fig : surfint ] .",
    "the dependence on @xmath10 is further weakened by the integration process with the result that @xmath146 is almost independent on the slope parameter up to @xmath147 .",
    "note , however , that both @xmath148 and @xmath149 are increasing function of @xmath10 as it is expected since models with smaller values of @xmath10 are more concentrated , i.e. the projected mass within a given distance from the centre is larger .    in sect.3 , we have evaluated the velocity dispersion , but indeed it is not this quantity that is measured . actually , from the observations it is possible to estimate the velocity dispersion projected along the line of sight and weighted with the surface luminosity density .",
    "this is given by :    @xmath150    where @xmath151 is the total surface luminosity density , @xmath152 the mass density of the stellar component and @xmath153 the total ( stellar plus dark matter ) mass profile . to be more realistic ,",
    "we average over a finite radial bin @xmath154 as follows ( see , e.g. , the appendix in dalal & keeton 2003 ) :    @xmath155 dr } } { 2 \\int_{r_1}^{r_2}{\\rho_{stars}(r ) \\left [ a(r_2/r ) - a(r_1/r ) \\right ] r dr } }   \\label{eq : sigmabin}\\ ] ]    with :    @xmath156    @xmath157    a caveat is in order here . in principle , @xmath151 is not equal to @xmath158",
    ". actually , we have to distinguish among three possibilities .",
    "first , let us suppose that we use a polls model for the dark halo of a galaxy in which case @xmath158 does not enter in @xmath151 , while the mass profile of the model still enters in determining the velocity dispersion through @xmath159 in eqs.([eq : sigmalos ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmabin ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , a polls model may also be used to fit the surface brightness profile of an elliptical galaxy so that we need both @xmath143 , @xmath46 and @xmath160 to evaluate @xmath161 and @xmath162 and also choose a model for the dark halo .",
    "finally , if the galaxy is a spiral one , we have a three component system thus complicating a lot describing the whole system and computing the velocity dispersion . in order to not introduce degeneracy among the model parameters and to better investigate the properties of the polls models , we restrict our attention to elliptical galaxies and assume that it is possible to use a polls model to fit the surface brightness .",
    "moreover , we arbitrarily set @xmath163 which implies that the larger is the distance from the centre , the larger is the bin width thus allowing to reproduce qualitatively the need of averaging over larger bins in the outer regions to ameliorate the signal to noise ratio .    under these assumptions",

    "it is worth noting that there is not a clear trend of @xmath162 with @xmath10 in the very inner regions ( @xmath174 not visible in the plot ) as a result of the complicated interplay between the density and the mass profiles due to the fact that @xmath175 enters only in @xmath176 .",

    "both these hypotheses ( in particular , the former one ) introduce systematics that quickly increase approaching the outer regions of the galaxy so that we have preferred to only evaluate @xmath162 in the very interiors to reduce these errors .",

    "the result for the n04 model is shown in fig.[fig : anidf ] for three arbitrarily chosen values of the anisotropy radius . comparing with fig.[fig : dfgamma ] for the isotropic case , we note that the reduced df is no more approximated by a simple power law .",
    "the dependence on the anisotropy dimensionless radius @xmath201 is quite strong for low values of @xmath213 with the reduced df being larger for smaller @xmath201 . on the other hand",

    "moreover , whatever is the value of @xmath217 , the df is divergent at the upper end of @xmath213 ( as in the isotropic case with @xmath213 replacing @xmath109 ) so that different values of the anisotropy radius have a negligible impact .",
    "in an attempt to look for underlying similarities among the plethora of spherically symmetric galaxy models discussed in literature , we have shown that most of the cuspy models may be considered as belongings to a general family defined by eq.([eq : genslope ] ) for the logarithmic slope @xmath14 of the radial profile .",
    "we have then restricted our attention to a subclass of models , dubbed polls , whose logarithmic slope is a power law in @xmath1 since this is in agreement with the results of the most recent and detailed numerical simulations available up to now @xcite .",
    "polls models are physically meaningful only if the slope parameter @xmath10 is positive .",
    "the mass density is non singular in the centre so that the models are not cuspy , while @xmath46 is an exponentially decreasing function of @xmath1 so that the total mass turns out to be finite .",
    "this is an interesting feature of the model that makes it different from , e.g. , the popular nfw model ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) that has to be truncated at the virial radius in order to define a finite total mass .",
    "the mass profile , the rotation curve and the gravitational potential of polls models have been evaluated analytically and turn out to be expressed in terms of special functions that are quite easy to handle ( e.g. , in numerical codes ) . in particular , while being asymptotically keplerian , the rotation curve is only slowly declining so that polls models may be good candidates for the dark halo of spiral galaxies . moreover , the position of the peak of the rotation curve may be used to constrain the value of the slope parameter thus breaking the degeneracy between @xmath10 and the total mass that have the same effect on both the rotation curve and the velocity dispersion .",
    "assuming isotropy in the velocity space , we have numerically evaluated the velocity dispersion that turns out to decline in the outer regions of the system thus offering the intriguing possibility that such models may reconcile the presence of a dark halo with the apparent lack of dark matter suggested by the declining velocity dispersion measured in intermediate luminosity elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "actually , it is not this quantity that has to be compared with the data , but the luminosity weighted line of sight velocity dispersion that we have computed assuming that the polls model is the only galaxy component .",
    "this is , of course , a quite unrealistic assumption so that a detailed comparison will be performed in a forthcoming paper where we will also take care of the surface brightness to constrain the modelling of luminous components .",
    "being the models spherically symmetric and isotropic , the df only depends on the binding energy @xmath130 and may be estimated using the eddington formula .",
    "it turns out that the df may be approximated as a single power law over a quite large range for @xmath130 , but the width of this interval and the goodness of the approximation depend critically on the values of the slope parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the density of states has also been evaluated for completeness and shows some qualitative features similar to the df , but with the opposite dependence on @xmath130 being a decreasing rather than an increasing function of the binding energy .",
    "the product of the df and the density of states gives the differential energy distribution @xmath129 that turns out to be a decreasing function with an abrupt cutoff at the upper extreme of the range for @xmath130 due to the finite central density .",
    "the properties of the polls models have all been investigated by assuming both spherical symmetry and isotropy in the velocity space . as a first step towards a more realistic description , we have also considered the effects of non vanishing anisotropy parameter @xmath187 on the radial velocity dispersion exploring two different parameterization , namely the popular osipkov - merrit model @xcite and the one recently proposed by mamon & lokas ( 2004a , b ) . in both cases , introducing an anisotropy in the velocity space leads to an increase of the radial velocity dispersion with respect to the corresponding isotropic models thus originating the well known mass - anisotropy degeneracy . actually , a combined analysis of both the line of sight velocity dispersion and the rotation curve could help in breaking this degeneracy being @xmath79 insensitive to @xmath187 .",
    "we have also estimated the df for osipkov - merrit anisotropic polls models finding out that the power law approximation for the df breaks down .",
    "as it is expected , the df now depends also on the anisotropy radius @xmath217 , but this dependence cancels out when considering high values of @xmath218 since the higher is @xmath218 , the more isotropic is the model and the nearer is the df to its divergence at @xmath219 .",
    "polls models are a first attempt towards a different approach to galaxy modelling . rather than starting from an expression for the mass density , our initial guess was on the logarithmic slope of the radial profile .",
    "this quantity gives an immediate understanding of the asymptotic behaviours of the density profile .",
    "moreover , it seems that @xmath14 is better constrained from numerical simulations . while our attention on polls models was mainly motivated by the results of navarro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that refer to dark haloes , modelling a galaxy also requires to consider its luminous components .",
    "these latter may be efficiently described by zhao models ( 1996 , 1997 ) that represent a generalization of both the popular jaffe ( 1983 ) and hernquist ( 1990 ) profiles .",
    "kinematical and dynamical data may then be used to constrain the properties of the full galaxy modeled using a zhao model for the luminous component and a polls one for the dark halo .",
    "we would like to conclude with a general comment .",
    "as the processing speed of modern supercomputers evolves , introducing new ( sophisticated or not ) models to fit the results of increasingly detailed numerical simulations becomes a more and more attractive temptation .",
    "actually , we believe that time is come to look for similarities rather than discrepancies among the models in order to find out what is the right answer to the questions posed by the structure of numerically simulated haloes . in our opinion , approaching the problem starting from the logarithmic slope may be a good road to successfully arrive at the final destination .",
