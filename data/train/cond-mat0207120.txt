    "the alkali atoms transfer their valence electrons into the conduction bands of the  subsystem and the materials become metallic .",
    "a noticeable enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature , @xmath7 , of  was expected when electrons are removed ( hole doping ) because of the larger density of states of the valence bands .",
    "doping of @xmath8 holes per  molecule and corresponding metalization was achieved with the use of field - effect doping technique and has resulted in @xmath9  k @xcite .",
    "such doping has also been realized recently @xcite .",
    "the intercalation of  with haloform molecules has led to an further increase of the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "such an enhancement of @xmath7 upon intercalation of molecules into a superconductor has been already observed earlier @xcite and was discussed theoretically @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on the normal properties of haloform intercalated .",
    "powder diffraction measurements at various temperatures @xcite have shown that above @xmath10  200  k the crystal structure of haloform intercalated  is hexagonal and transforms to a triclinic structure below @xmath11  k. the stoichiometric composition of these materials is  ( x = cl , br ) .",
    "solid state nmr measurements on  have shown that above 193  k the  molecules rotate isotropically @xcite , similar to that found in pure face - centered cubic ( fcc ) .",
    "whereas below this temperature a rotation barrier of 6  was evaluated . also the bromoform molecules are found to be motionally active down to 218  k @xcite .",
    "dinnebier @xcite calculated the electronic structure of these materials using a two - dimensional periodic tight - binding formalism where only one specific lattice plane was considered .",
    "they omitted the haloform molecules completely and took only the valence electrons of the five - fold degenerate @xmath12 molecular orbital ( mo ) of each  explicitely into account .",
    "the main conclusion of their calculations is that the electronic density of states ( dos ) at the fermi energy for @xmath8 holes per  molecule satisfies following sequence : dos ( ) @xmath13 dos ( ) @xmath5 dos ( ) . hence , the observed enhancement of @xmath7 can not simply be explained by an increase of the dos at the fermi energy when  is intercalated with haloform molecules and  is replaced by  ( _ vide supra _ ) . given these observations and results , it is of interest to study the electronic properties of these materials in more detail .",
    "we have performed all - electron density functional ( df ) calculations on several crystal structures of bulk  ( x = cl , br ) to predict their electronic structures and to examine the effect of introduced charge carriers ( doping with electrons as well as with holes ) . employed",

    "different charge doping levels are simulated simply by removing or adding electrons from the systems .",
    "unlike previous work @xcite our df calculations include all electrons of the system into the quantum treatment _ and _ the haloform molecules are taken into account explicitly .",

    "df calculations have also been performed on an fcc and on a hypothetical hexagonal lattice of  molecules . the latter system is formed by artificially removing the haloform molecules from .",
    "these calculations allow to examine changes in the electronic structure of the  subsystem ( i ) upon intercalation and ( ii ) due to electronic contributions of the haloform molecules separately .",
