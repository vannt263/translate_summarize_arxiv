    "the distorted diamond chain ( ddc ) is a one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum spin model with structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure+phases](a ) and hamiltonian @xmath4 this model with spins 1/2 and all couplings antiferromagnetic may be strongly frustrated owing to the triangular building blocks and has receiced increasing interest in the last decade for a number of reasons @xcite : it has a rich quantum phase diagram as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : structure+phases](b ) ( taken from ref .  ) . here and in the following we choose a representation with @xmath5 as energy unit and @xmath6 as variables .",
    "this representation emphasizes the symmetry of the model under exchange of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "three quantum phases have been discussed for the ground state of the model in zero magnetic field : for @xmath7 the ground state develops from the state with dimers in their singlet state on @xmath8 bonds and nearly free spins between these dimers .",
    "the low energy sector is governed by an effective antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with @xmath9 sites resulting from the residual coupling between these spins and denoted as @xmath10 in the following .",
    "this leads to the formation of a spin fluid ( sf ) phase with additional high energy excitations . for intermediate @xmath6 the ground state dimerizes , forming a twofold degenerate sequence of alternating tetramers and dimers ( td phase )",
    "finally , for both @xmath6 , sufficiently large , the ground state is ferrimagnetic with e.g. a @xmath11 structure of the unit cell of three spins ( which satisfies @xmath0 and @xmath1 bonds and frustrates @xmath8 ) .",
    "these three phases can be clearly identified already in the symmetric model with @xmath12 in the regimes @xmath13 ( sf phase ) , @xmath14 ( td phase ) and @xmath15 ( ferrimagnetic phase ) with @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the generalization to the distorted diamond chain @xmath17 leads to an even richer behaviour including e.g.  the trimer heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain on the @xmath18 axis with the standard haf for @xmath19 as limiting case .",
    "the ddc model can be seen as generalization of the haf with nn and nnn interactions : the critical point of this model at @xmath20 which marks the transition from a spin fluid to the dimerized phase is extended into the line between the sf and the td phases in the ddc model and the majumdar ghosh point at @xmath21 is extended into the line @xmath14 with simple and exactly known dimerized ground states . in particular , the transition line between the sf and td phases is a line of kosterlitz - thouless phase transitions .",
    "the point @xmath22 is a point of particular high degeneracy .",
    "however , compared to the simple haf chain with nearest and next nearest exchange , the ddc model has the dimer subsystem as an additional degree of freedom which dominates the high energy regime , but also , in the appropriate parameter regime , interacts with the low energy spin part .",
    "the ferrimagnetic part of the quantum phase diagram is another consequence of the combined influence of these two degrees of freedom .",
    "an external magnetic field polarizes the quasi - free spins and at a critical field @xmath23 produces a magnetization plateau at 1/3 of the total saturation magnetization .",
    "the plateau state corresponds to a fully saturated subsystem of spins 1/2 and all dimers ( @xmath8 bonds ) in their singlet state .",
    "further increase of the moment requires breaking up at least one dimer with its large energy scale @xmath5 and therefore a correspondingly higher field @xmath24 ( end of the plateau ) .",
    "finally complete saturation is obtained at the field @xmath25 , given by @xmath26    the critical field @xmath27 ( beginning of the 1/3 plateau ) is determined by the level crossing between the saturated state of the effective haf and its ferromagnon excitation with one unit of magnetization less .",
    "if the mapping to the effective haf applies , this gives the relation @xmath28    apart from the theoretical interest in investigating a model which allows to follow the variation between different quantum phases , the ddc model is of interest since it seems to describe reasonably well the compound azurite , cu@xmath2(co@xmath2)@xmath3(oh)@xmath3 .",
    "azurite has been investigated in detail by static measurements ( magnetization , susceptilibity , specific heat @xcite ) as well as by high field esr @xcite and the existence of the 1/3 magnetization plateau has been clearly established . from these experiments , this compound appears to be in the sf phase close to the phase transition to the td phase .",
    "recently , however , the possibility of one of the couplings @xmath29 being ferromagnetic has been suggested from susceptibility and specific heat data @xcite . beyond the static properties investigated so far ,",
    "the dynamics of the ddc and the material azurite in particular remain as a challenge to be understood both experimentally and theoretically : the characteristic feature of the model , namely the presence of two degrees of freedom with different energy scales and their mutual influence will show up most clearly in the energy spectra of the model .",
    "these are best investigated by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments as clearly seen in recent work @xcite . for a more complete description both of the ddc in the full phase diagram and of the results of ins experiments on azurite we present in the following results on the dynamics in the sf phase ( section [ sec : sf - dynamics ] ) and in the td phase ( section [ sec : td - dynamics ] ) .",
    "a perturbative approach can be applied to obtain results in the regime @xmath30 ( see ref .  ) as well as close to some special points in the phase diagram . generally , however , for a quantitative description numerical calculations are required .",
    "we will present in the following the results of exact diagonalization , using both the lanczos algorithm for systems with 24 spins and complete diagonalization ( all eigenvalues ) for 12 and 18 spins .",
    "the latter are necessary since the lanczos algorithm gives only a limited number of the lowest energy levels in the subspace considered ( in our case : @xmath31 and wave vector @xmath32 ) which is not sufficient to cover the excited dimer subspace with its higher energies .",
    "since the elementary cell has 3 spins , our system sizes are restricted to 4 , 6 and 8 elementary cells .",
    "it turns out , however , that this for many aspects is sufficient to obtain reliable results for the infinite system when a finite size analysis is carried through .",
    "it is helpful to start the discussion from two well known limiting cases : + ( i ) for @xmath33 the system reduces to @xmath9 independent dimers and @xmath9 free spins . in the ground state all dimers are in their singlet state and a @xmath34  fold degeneracy due to the free spins results .",
    "a magnetic field immediately saturates the free spin system leading to a magnetization of @xmath35 which remains constant until at a field @xmath36 the dimers change to their triplet states saturating the system .",
    "this behavior to a certain extent remains valid on the symmetry line @xmath37 where the total spins on all @xmath38bonds are independently conserved : the ground state as well as the 1/3 magnetization plateau in low field remain unchanged whereas the transition to full saturation is determined by the effective interaction which develops between two neighboring dimers in their triplet state and finally leads to an effective @xmath39 chain .",
    "qualitatively , for a large range of parameters the distorted diamond chain can be divided into two subsystems with clearly different energy scales , a low energy part of @xmath9 spins 1/2 and a high energy part of @xmath9 dimers .    for small deviations from the independent free spin limit , @xmath17",
    ", the spin 1/2 subsystem develops some coupling by polarizing intermediate dimers and the @xmath34  fold degeneracy is lifted in favor of an effective heisenberg chain with exchange @xmath10 . in this regime ,",
    "excitations of the ddc remain well separated : they are in the low energy regime with energy scale @xmath10 forming the spinon continuum of the haf with @xmath9 spins in the brillouin zone of the full ddc ( lattice constant @xmath40 , reciprocal lattice vector @xmath41 ) or in the high energy regime with energy scale @xmath5 corresponding to the excitation of a dimer to its triplet state and developping into a dispersive band with width @xmath42 due to the coupling to the low energy spin subsystem",
    ". we will not consider in the following states with more than one excited dimer .",
    "\\(ii ) for @xmath43 the system reduces to the heisenberg antiferromagnet with @xmath44 spins , forming a spinon continuum in the brillouin cell with reciprocal lattice vector @xmath45 , energy scale 1 and no additional high energy excitations .",
    "for @xmath46 we have a trimerized heisenberg chain and the spectrum is obtained by folding back the spinon continuum to the smaller brillouin zone corresponding to lattice constant @xmath40 .",
    "this results in three excitation branches ( actually continua ) which fill the energy range up to @xmath47 with small ( for @xmath0 slightly less then 1 ) gaps between them and an alternating sequence of minimum , maximum and minimum at wavevector @xmath48 ( in the following we will use exclusively the brillouin zone with reciprocal lattice vector @xmath49 , corresponding to the full ddc ) . with increasing @xmath50 , these trimer bands develop increasingly larger gaps , finally the continuum of the effective haf emerges from the lowest band and the two upper bands conspire to give the dimer excitations decorated by continua of low energy spinon excitations .    using this frame the lowest excitations of interest in the following",
    "are easily described : + ( i ) the spinon continuum of the effective chain , + ( ii ) the band with one excited dimer above the spinon continuum , + ( iii ) the inverted ferromagnon i.e.  the saturated effective haf with one spin deviation ( @xmath51 ) , and + ( iv ) the band with one excited dimer above the saturated effective haf ( one dimer in its triplet state ( @xmath52 ) . + the dispersion of excitations ( ii)-(iv ) is determined by hopping processes ( spin deviations resp . dimer triplets moving to neighboring sites due to the residual interactions ) .",
    "to lowest order these processes result in a cosine dispersion and we introduce as notation for ( ii ) @xmath53 more precisely , this excitation is not a single band but a continuum due to the spinon continuum of initial states ; however , we will only be able to discuss the lower edge of this excitation and therefore simplify the notation using eq.([eq : spinonexciteddimer ] ) . excitations ( iii ) and ( iv )",
    "are the relevant excitations above the 1/3 plateau , we therefore use a notation giving their energies in finite magnetic fields relative to the plateau ground state with @xmath54 : @xmath55 the quantities @xmath56 and @xmath57 give the widths , resp .",
    "the nontrivial contributions to the minimum energy ( at @xmath58 ) of the corresponding bands .",
    "the cosine dispersion of course is only valid in lowest order and will change to a more complicated expression for real systems .    in the model of an effective haf for the low energy regime its exchange constant",
    "@xmath10 determines the low energy spinon ( i ) and the inverted ferromagnon spectrum : @xmath59 .",
    "combined with @xmath60 it is also sufficient to give the range of the plateau phase and to characterize its dynamics : in the presence of a finite field , spectra are identical to those without field except for the shifts and splittings due to zeeman energies .",
    "this establishes states with an increasingly larger total spin @xmath61 ( in their maximum @xmath62component ) as ground states .",
    "the plateau begins at the field @xmath27 when the @xmath63 level ( saturated state of the quasi - free spin subsystem ) is forced below the lowest @xmath64 level ( ferromagnon band at wavevector @xmath65 ) by the external field , leading to @xmath66 .",
    "the lowest excitation for the plateau dynamics close to the field @xmath23 then is the ferromagnon of eq.([eq : ferromagnon ] ) .",
    "when the field is increased across the plateau regime , the @xmath67 level ( one excited dimer on top of the saturated quasi - free spin subsystem ) lowers its energy , crosses the ferromagnon excitation and finally is responsible for the end of the plateau at the upper plateau field @xmath68 implying @xmath69    the parameters determining the spectra can be calculated in perturbation theory in @xmath6 and to lowest order are determined by the level spectrum of the general ( @xmath17 ) tetramer with 4 spins 0  3 .",
    "this spectrum includes the lowest order information about @xmath10 in the singlet - triplet splitting of spins 0 and 3 and about @xmath70 in the amplitude for the process @xmath71 ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 are noninteracting dimer states ) which determines the propagation of an excited dimer triplet . the results to lowest order in @xmath6 are : @xmath74    @xmath10 has been calculated in straightforward perturbation theory up to fifth order @xcite , based on the splitting of the general tetramer into singlet and triplet states we have obtained a result which accounts",
    "partly also for higher orders and allows reasonable estimates for @xmath75 , but finite @xmath76 : @xmath77    in lowest order perturbation theory the relevant parameter , in addition to the energy scale set by @xmath8 and to @xmath76 , is the exchange of the effective haf determined by @xmath78 and many characteristic quantities of the ddc would be related by simple numerical factors if the mapping were perfect . whereas these perturbational results allow to discuss the dynamics in principle , @xmath6 values of interest for the bulk of the phase diagram as well as for a material such as azurite are beyond the validity of perturbation theory .",
    "we therefore present in the following results from the numerical approaches described above .",

    "[ fig : pt : specheat]c ) the ddc is close to saturation and the differences between the two phases , resulting from the energy spectra above the plateau gap , become apparent again . in particular , the well defined grouping into soliton bands at @xmath150 leads to a strong low temperature peak which actulaly develops continuously from lower @xmath1 values .",
    "it would be interesting to see , using more powerful numerical methods , whether the development of this peak in the nearly saturated case shows critical properties .",
    "( red / full ) and @xmath96 ( blue / open ) ) of the ddc ( n=24 ) for @xmath116 and ( from top to bottom ) @xmath151 .",

    "[ fig : pt : spectra ] shows a sequence of spectra of low - lying excitations ( @xmath152 ) in zero magnetic field obtained by the same procedure as the spectra shown in sections [ sec : sf - dynamics ] and [ sec : td - dynamics ] .",
    "qualitatively , the transition from the sf phase with its gapless spinon continuum to the gapped soliton spectra in the td phase is clearly seen qualitatively , as far as possible for the limited size of the system : with increasing @xmath1 the second degenerate ground state at @xmath58 emerges , the spinon continuum is compressed into the soliton band and the gapless character disappears .",
    "excitation spectra in finite magnetic field , in particular for fields in the plateau regime , on the other hand do not show specific variations but rather continuous changes across the phase diagram without prominent features close to @xmath153 , the location of the phase transition in zero field .",
    "this illustrates , as expected , that the signature of the phase transition in the dynamics is limited to zero external field and low - lying excitations wehreas the 1/3 plateau as well as the accompanying excitations are continuous across the phase diagram .",
    "for the @xmath154 distorted diamond chain in both the spin fluid ( sf ) and the tetramer - dimer ( td ) phases we have calculated the spectra of low - lying excitations and the specific heat .",
    "we have used both full numerical diagonalization ( for chains with up to 18 spins ) and the lanczos algorithm ( for chains with up to 24 spins ) and have discussed the results in relation to approximate analytic approaches . except close to the sf - td phase transition results for our small systems",
    "are shown to represent the thermodynamic limit .",
    "our calculations are for arbitrary value of the external magnetic field , results are mainly given for zero field and for fields corresponding to the 1/3 plateau regime .",
    "in the sf phase the low energy spectra can be related to a heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain with effective interaction @xmath10 . for parameters beyond the validity of a perturbative approach",
    ", this effective interaction has to be allowed to be energy dependent .",
    "the lowest excitations in the plateau regime are the inverted ferromagnon and the propagating single dimer triplet excitation with , however , partly strong modifications of the corresponding cosine dispersions",
    ". the values of the characteristic parameters ( @xmath10 , extent of the plateau regime , widths of the cosine bands ) are given for typical paths crossing the sf phase .",
    "these data should allow to decide whether a material such as cu@xmath2(co@xmath2)@xmath3(oh)@xmath3 ( azurite ) is sufficiently well described by the ddc model and , if so , to determine the corresponding couplings .",
    "the standard assumption for azurite is to take all couplings as antiferromagnetic and we have shown that the spectra of low - lying excitations exhibit large and characteristic changes when the possibility of one ferromagnetic coupling is introduced .",
    "we therefore expect that our data will allow to interpret quantitatively experimentla data on azurite .",
    "this refers in particular to the results of inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite . considering the present status of such investigations",
    ", our results do not confirm the conclusion of at least one ferromagnetic coupling in azurite .",
    "generally , our results lead us to describe the following signatures when ferromagnetic couplings are present : + ( i ) whereas the dimer width is roughly 1/2 of the ferromagnon width for af couplings ( as suggested by perturbation theory ) , for ferromagnetic couplings these widths tend to become equal .",
    "+ ( ii ) the sign of the couplings has a marked influence on the relative appearance of the ferromagnon and the excited dimer band : for couplings @xmath155 these bands above the 1/3 plateau overlap , whereas for @xmath156 ferromagnon a swell as dimer width become very small and correspondingly @xmath23 becomes much smaller than in perturbation theory .",
    "the low - lying excitations in the td phase with its twofold degenerate ground state are shown to be solitons .",
    "the width of the one soliton band as determined from the @xmath138 chain not too far from the symmetry line @xmath157 reproduces well the soliton bands in the @xmath85 chain and therefore gives reliably the tunneling amplitude for the soliton propagation in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have also shown spectra as well as the specific heat on a line across the sf - td phase transition .",
    "although the small systems accessible to us do not allow to discuss critical properties of the ddc close to this kosterlitz - thouless transition , the variation of the dynamical properties through the transition become clear . in particular , only the low energy properties , determining the behavior of the system at zero field , carry the signature of the phase transition .",
    "generally , the ddc has many features in common with the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain with nearest and next - nearest exchange and the sf - td phase transition is of the same type as the kt transition at @xmath158 in this system .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown that the additional degrees of freedom , resulting from the possibility to excite the @xmath38 dimers to the triplet state , show up clearly in the dynamics .",
    "we leave to the future to investigate the influence of these degrees of frededom on the phase transition using more powerful anlytical and numerical methods .",
