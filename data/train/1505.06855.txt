    "the desire for entertainment and infotainment services while on board and the need for better traffic safety is expected to increase the traffic generated by vehicles in the near future @xcite . for the time",
    "being infotainment services utilize the existing macro - cellular 3gpp infrastructure",
    ". however , in dense urban cities and/or during traffic jams , the capacity demand can be high and the existing infrastructure might not be able to support a fast access to the public cloud for all users . also , nowadays , passengers are connected to the macro - cellular network directly , through the metallic vehicle body that can introduce losses up to about @xmath0 db @xcite . in case",
    "metal coated windows are used , the losses can be even higher .",
    "providing an adequate quality of experience for the users on - move requires the development of new technical enablers .",
    "possible enablers can include ultra - dense network deployments and mounted antennas on the roof of the vehicles acting as moving relays @xcite .",
    "nowadays , cellular deployments in urban environments are characterized by inter - site distances as low as @xmath1 m  @xcite .",
    "further network densification along urban streets ( hereafter street micro cells ) can be used to increase the amount of load that can be served . at the same time",
    ", passengers inside a vehicle can connect to the micro base station through a gateway with an antenna mounted on the roof of the vehicle overcoming high penetration losses .",
    "the authorization scheme for vehicular communication is not yet standardized .",
    "one option could be to use same spectrum with macro - cellular network , i.e. @xmath2 mhz to @xmath3 ghz in urban areas and either partition the spectrum between macro and micro layer or use the full spectrum under a shared spectrum access regime .",
    "same approach has been proposed for overlaying indoor femto - cells to the macro - cellular network  @xcite . in this paper , we study spectrum coexistence issues between the micro and the femto layer .",
    "we consider two different possibilities : ( i ) femto - cells utilize same spectrum with street micro - cells i.e. antenna on the roof of the vehicle generates interference indoors ( ii ) femto - cells utilize same spectrum with in - car base station while street micro - cells are allocated at different spectrum . in order to assess the impact of vehicular transmissions to indoor users , we develop a model for aggregate interference and sir distribution .",
    "modeling of aggregate interference level has received a lot of attention in the literature  @xcite .",
    "recently , elements from stochastic geometry have been incorporated into interference related studies due to their analytical tractability : when the locations of transmitters are modeled using a poisson point process ( ppp ) , the laplace transform ( lt ) of the interference distribution can be expressed in an integral form and for pathloss exponent equal to four , the integral of the inverse lt can be solved in a closed - form  @xcite . usually , a simple power law model is used to describe the distance - based attenuation from each individual transmitter and the impact of fast / slow fading can also be incorporated into the model . while power law model is sufficient to describe distance - based propagation path loss in outdoor macro - cells , there are more accurate models to describe attenuation along street micro - cells . according to these models the power law changes beyond a certain distance breakpoint   @xcite .",
    "this makes the analytical treatment of interference distribution more involved .    in this paper",
    "we compute the lt and the moments of aggregate interference generated from parked / moving cars at the worst case located indoor user facing a crossroad .",
    "we use the method of moments to approximate the distribution of aggregate interference .",
    "we show that the inverse gamma distribution approximates closely the interference distribution in the upper tail .",
    "since the outage probability at the indoor user is determined from the lower tail of the sir distribution , modeling the interference by inverse gamma distribution turns out to be a reasonable choice .    with a low - complex and accurate interference model at hand we turn our attention to the sir distribution modeling .",
    "we assume nakagami - m channel model for radio propagation indoors and express the outage probability at the femto - cell in terms of the meijer g function which in our cases of interests reduces to generalized hypergeometric function widely available in most of today s software packages for numerical computations . by using it ,",
    "we study how the density of cars , the uplink transmit power level and the car isolation impact the outage probability at the femto - cell .",
    "we show that mounted roof - top antennas generate unacceptably high interference level at the femto - cell while in - car and femto - cell communication can coexist in same spectrum .",
    "also , we utilize the proposed model to illustrate that the most significant part of the interference comes from the street facing the femto - cell . based on this observation , we argue that for mounted roof - top antennas frequency planning between street micro - cells and indoor femto - cells could be an option for performance enhancement .",
    "we consider a dense urban city with street layout following the manhattan grid .",
    "the building block length is denoted by @xmath4 and the street width is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "let us define the distance between neighboring streets as @xmath6 , see fig .",

    ", the vehicles are distributed according to a ppp model . at particular snapshot ,",
    "each vehicle is active in the uplink with a certain probability . as a result",
    ", the distribution of uplink transmissions along a street follows a ppp too .",
    "we denote the ppp on the @xmath7-th vertical street by @xmath8 with density ( i.e. number of uplink transmissions per meter ) @xmath9 and on the @xmath10 th horizontal street by @xmath11 with density @xmath12 .",

    "one may notice that for the @xmath7-th vertical street @xmath24 while for the vertical street facing the considered femto - cell , @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 . also , the parameter @xmath27 accounts for antenna gain , car isolation ( in the case of in - car base station ) and wall losses with typical wall attenuation in the range of @xmath28 db .",
    "we want to identify whether uplink vehicular communication and indoor femto - cells can coexist in the same spectrum . in order to do",
    "that we evaluate the outage probability for given sir target @xmath29 at the worst - case located femto - cell facing a cross - road , see fig .  1 .",
    "in order to evaluate the sir distribution we need a model for the aggregate interference distribution and a model for the wanted signal power level at the femto - cell .",
    "assuming nakagami - m fading for indoor propagation , the wanted signal power is gamma distributed with shape @xmath30 and scale @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the mean received signal power .",

    "the interference level can be expressed as the sum of interference levels from all active car base stations on all vertical and horizontal streets . @xmath33",
