    "galaxy clusters are one of the most impressive evolving structures from an earlier stage of the universe .",
    "usually , they congregate thousands of galaxies and are endowed with a hot gas ( in the intra cluster medium ) , emitting x - rays primarily through thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "several studies in the last decade have suggested that the combination of data from different physical processes in galaxy clusters provides a natural method for estimating some cosmological parameters ( bartlett & silk 1994 , rephaeli 1995 , kobayashy _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , reese _",
    "_ 2002 ; barttlet 2004 ; de filippis _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; bonamente _ et al .",
    "the ultimate goal in the near future is to shed some light on the nature of the dark energy .",
    "an important phenomena occurring in clusters is the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) , a small distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) spectrum provoked by the inverse compton scattering of the cmb photons passing through a population of hot electrons ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) .",
    "since the sze is insensitive to the redshift of galaxy clusters , it provides a very convenient tool for studies at intermediate redshifts where the abundance of clusters depends strongly on the underlying cosmology ( the unique redshift dependence appear in the total sze flux due to the apparent size of the cluster ) . another fundamental process is the x - ray emission from the hot electrons in the intracluster medium .",
    "when the x - ray surface brightness is combined with the sze temperature decrement in the cmb spectrum , the angular diameter distance of galaxy clusters is readily obtained .    the possibility to estimate the galaxy cluster distances trough sz / x - ray technique",
    "was suggested long ago by many authors ( silk & white 1978 ; birkinshaw 1979 ; cavaliere _ et al .",
    "_ 1979 ) , but only recently it has been applied for a fairly large number of clusters ( for reviews , see birkinshaw 1999 ; carlstrom , hoder & reese 2002 ) .",
    "such a method is based on the different dependence of the cluster electron density ( @xmath7 ) and the temperature @xmath8 of the sze ( @xmath9 ) and x - ray bremsstrahlung ( @xmath10 ) . combining both measurements it is possible to estimate the angular diameter distance and infer the value of the hubble constant whether the cosmology is fixed .",
    "the main advantage of this method for estimating @xmath0 is that it does not rely on extragalactic distance ladder being fully independent of any local calibrator .",
    "a basic disadvantage rests on the difficulty of modeling the cluster gas which causes great systematic uncertainties in its determination .",
    "in particular , this means that systematic effects on @xmath0 are quite different from the ones presented by other methods , like the traditional distance ladder or gravitational lensing ( reese _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ; jones _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ; de filippis _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) .    in order to estimate the distance to the cluster from its x - ray spectroscopy , one needs to add some complementary assumptions about its geometry .",
    "the importance of the intrinsic geometry of the cluster has been emphasized by many authors ( fox & pen 2002 ; jing & suto 2002 ; plionis _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ; sereno _ et al .",
    "the standard spherical geometry has been severely questioned , since chandra and xmm - newton observations have shown that clusters usually exhibit an elliptical surface brightness . in a point of fact , the cluster shape estimation problem is a difficult matter since many clusters do not appear in radio , x - ray , or optical .",
    "another source of difficulty is related to the error bars .",
    "assuming that the clusters have an axisymmetric form , different authors introduced a roughly random uncertainty in @xmath0 between @xmath11% ( hughes & birkinshaw 1998 ; sulkanen 1999 ; reese _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ; jones _ et al .",
    "the assumed cluster shape also affects considerably the sze / x - ray distances , and , therefore , the hubble constant estimates .",
    "fox and pen ( 2002 ) estimate the hubble constant by assuming triaxial clusters and measuring the distance to artificial observations corrected for asphericity .",
    "de filippis and collaborators ( 2005 ) showed that the spherical hypothesis is strongly rejected for most members of the sample studied . by taking into account such an effect for two samples ,",
    "a better agreement with the cosmic concordance model ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) was obtained .",
    "triaxial clusters may also be useful for reconciling the observed discrepancies in the total mass of clusters as computed with lensing and x - ray measurements ( in this connection see bonamente _",
    "_ 2006 ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath0 has a practical and theoretical importance to many astrophysical properties of galaxies and quasars , and several cosmological calculations , like the age of the universe , its size and energy density , primordial nucleosynthesis , and others ( freedman 2000 ; peacock 1999 ) .",
    "( 2006 ) have shown that cmb studies can not supply strong constraints on the value of @xmath0 on their own .",
    "this problem occurs due to the degenerescency on the parameter space ( tegmark _ et al _ 2004 ) , and may be circumvented only by using independent measurements of @xmath0 ( hu 2005 ) .    on the other hand , according to cold dark matter ( cdm ) picture of structure formation , large - scale fluctuations have grown since @xmath14 by gravitational instability .",
    "the cosmological perturbations excite sound waves in the relativistic plasma , producing the acoustic peaks in the early universe .",
    "( 2005 ) presented the large scale correlation function from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) showing clear evidence for the baryon acoustic peak at @xmath15 mpc scale , which is in excellent agreement with the wmap prediction from the cmb data .",
    "the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) method is _ independent of the hubble constant _",
    "@xmath0 which means that we can use bao signature to break the degenerescency of the mass parameter @xmath16 .",
    "hence , combining sze / x - ray method to obtain @xmath17 with bao it is possible to improve the limits over @xmath0 ( for recent applications of bao see , lima _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) .    in this letter , by assuming that the clusters are ellipsoids with one axis parallel to the line of sight , we derive new constraints on the hubble constant @xmath0 . by considering the sample of 25 triaxial clusters given by de filippis _ et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) , we perform a joint analysis combining the data from sze and x - ray surface brightness with the recent sdss measurements of the baryon acoustic peak ( eisenstein _ et al .",
    "let us now consider that the universe is described by a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) geometry driven by cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant . in this case , we have only two free parameters ( @xmath18 ) and the angular diameter distance , @xmath17 reads ( lima _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 , alcaniz 2004 , de filippis _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and the dimensionless function @xmath21 is given by @xmath22^{1/2}. \\label{eq2}\\ ] ]    following de filippis _",
    "( 2005 ) , a general triaxial morphology it will adopted here . in this case , the intra cluster medium is described by an isothermal triaxial @xmath23-model distribution and the sze decrement reads    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the cmb temperature , @xmath8 is the gas temperature , @xmath26 is the thompson cross section , the factor @xmath27 accounts for frequency shift and relativistic corrections , @xmath28 is the central number density of the cluster gas , @xmath29 is a function of the cluster shape and orientation , @xmath30 is the axial ratio of the major to the minor axes of the observed projected isophotes , @xmath31 is the projection on the plane of the sky of the intrinsic angular core radius , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 denotes the gamma function ) .    similarly , the x - ray central surface brightness @xmath34 can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the redshift of the cluster , @xmath37 is the x - ray cooling function of the icm in the cluster rest frame and @xmath38 is the molecular weight ( @xmath39 ) .    de filippis and collaborators ( 2005 ) studied and corrected the @xmath17 measurements for 25 clusters , getting a better agreement with the @xmath1cdm models .",
    "we used two samples studied by them to investigate the bounds arising from sze / x - ray observations .",
    "one of the samples , compiled by reese _",
    "( 2002 ) , is a selection of 18 galaxy clusters distributed over the redshift interval @xmath40 .",
    "the other one , the sample of mason _",
    "( 2001 ) , has 7 clusters from the x - ray limited flux sample of ebeling _ et al . _",
    "de filippis _ et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) show that the samples turn out slightly biased , with strongly elongated clusters preferentially aligned along the line of sight .",
    "their results suggest that 15 clusters are in fact more elongated along the line of sight , while the remaining 10 clusters are compressed .    in fig .",
    "1 , the galaxy cluster sample is plotted on a residual hubble diagram using a flat cosmic concordance model ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "we see that the @xmath42 cluster is the largest outlier , and our statistical analysis confirms that its inclusion leads to the highest @xmath43 .",
    "for that reason we have excluded this data point from the statistical analysis .",
    "now , let us perform a @xmath43 fit over the @xmath44 plane . in our analysis we use a maximum likelihood that can be determined by a @xmath43 statistics , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the observational angular diameter distance ,",
    "@xmath47 is the uncertainty in the individual distance and the pair , @xmath48 , is the complete set of parameters .    in what follows ,",
    "we first consider the sze / x - ray distances separately , and , further , we present a joint analysis including the bao signature from the sdss catalog . note that a specific flat cosmology has not been fixed by hand in the analyzes below .",
    "we now consider the @xmath49 clusters ( without the a773 , see fig.1 ) , which constitutes the sze / x - ray data from de filippis _ et al . _",
    "our analysis indicated that any cosmological model could be accepted by that sample until @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 free parameters ) .",
    "it also shows that using only the ellipsoidal cluster sample we can not constrain the energetic components of the cosmological model .",
    "this happens basically because the error bars are large , mainly at intermediate and high redshifts .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the contours of constant likelihood ( 68.3% , 95.4% and 99.7% ) in the space parameter @xmath52 for the sz / x - ray data discussed earlier . note that only a small range for the @xmath53 parameter is allowed , ( @xmath54 ) , at @xmath6 of confidence level .",
    "in particular , we found @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 at @xmath58% c.l . for @xmath59 free parameter .",
    "naturally , such bounds on @xmath53 are reasonably dependent on the cosmological model adopted .",
    "for example , if we fix @xmath60 we have @xmath61 , for @xmath62 we have @xmath63 , and both cases are permitted with high degree of confidence .",
    "clearly , we see that an additional cosmological test ( fixing @xmath16 ) is necessary in order to break the degenerescency on the @xmath64 plane .    systematic effects still need to be considered .",
    "the common errors are : sz @xmath65% , x - ray @xmath66% , radio halos @xmath67% , @xmath68% for galactic n@xmath69 , @xmath70% for isothermality , @xmath51% kinetic sz , clumping causes @xmath71% , radio source confusion @xmath72% , primary beam @xmath73% and @xmath59% on the cmb . when we combine the errors in quadrature , we find that the typical error are of @xmath74% - @xmath75% , in agreement with others works ( mason _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ; reese _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ; reese 2004 ) .",
    "as remarked earlier , more stringent constraints on the space parameter ( @xmath76 ) can be obtained by combining the sze / x - ray with the bao signature ( eisenstein _ et al .",
    "the peak detected ( from a sample of 46748 luminous red galaxies selected from the sdss main sample ) is predicted to arise precisely at the measured scale of 100 @xmath77 mpc .",
    "basically , it happens due to the baryon acoustic oscillations in the primordial baryon - photon plasma prior to recombination .",
    "let us now consider it as an additional cosmological test over the ellipsoidal cluster sample .",
    "such a measurement is characterized by @xmath78^{2/3 }   = 0.469 \\pm 0.017 , \\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the redshift at which the acoustic scale has been measured , and @xmath80 is the dimensionless comoving distance to @xmath81 .",
    "note that the above quantity is independent of the hubble constant , and , as such , the bao signature alone constrains only the @xmath16 parameter .",
    "this property is very characteristic of the bao signature , thereby differentiating it from many others classical cosmological tests , like the gas mass fraction ( lima _ et al . _",
    "2003 ; allen _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ; cunha _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) , luminosity distance ( peebles & ratra 2003 ; cunha _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) , or the age of the universe ( alcaniz _ et al . _",
    "2003 ; cunha & santos 2004 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the confidence regions for the sze / x - ray cluster distance and bao joint analysis . by comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , one may see how the bao signature breaks the degenerescency in the @xmath82 plane .",
    "as it appears , the bao test presents a striking orthogonality centered at @xmath83 with respect to the angular diameter distance data as determined from sze / x - ray processes .",
    "we find @xmath84 and @xmath85 at @xmath58% ( c.l . ) for @xmath59 free parameter .",
    "an important lesson here is that the combination of sze / x - ray with bao provides an interesting approach to constrain the hubble constant .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we have plotted the likelihood function for the @xmath53 parameter in a flat @xmath1cdm universe for the sze / x - ray + bao data set .",
    "the dotted lines are cuts in the regions of @xmath58% probability and @xmath86% .",
    "our results are in line with some recent analyzes based on different cosmological observations , like the one provided by the wmap team @xmath87 ( spergel _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) , and the hst project @xmath88 ( freedman _ et al .",
    "note , however , that it does not agree with the recent determination , @xmath89 ( random ) @xmath90 ( systematics ) , recently advocated by sandage and collaborators ( 2006 ) . a result obtained with basis on type ia supernovae , calibrated with cepheid variables in nearby galaxies that hosted them .    at this point , it is interesting to compare our results with others recent works in which the limits on @xmath53 were obtained by fixing the cosmology ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , cosmic concordance ) , and assuming spherical geometry .",
    "a measurement using sz effect was accomplished by mason _",
    "( 2001 ) , using 5 clusters , and gives @xmath91 ; reese and coauthors ( 2002 ) , using 18 clusters , found @xmath92 , and in a posterior analysis reese ( 2004 ) , with 41 clusters , obtains @xmath93 ; jones _ et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) derived @xmath94 , using a sample of 5 clusters free of any orientation bias . in a recent paper , bonamente _",
    "( 2006 ) , using 38 clusters , obtained @xmath95 .",

    "( @xmath102 ) the bao+sze / x - ray analysis also provides @xmath103 .",
    "hopefully , future developments related to the physics of clusters may shed some light on the nature of the dark energy ( for reviews see peebles & ratra 2003 ; padmanhaban 2003 ; lima 2004 ) .",
    "since the original work of hubble , the precise determination of the distance scale ( @xmath0 ) has been a recurrent problem in the development of physical cosmology . in this letter",
    "we have discussed a new determination of the hubble constant based on the sze / x - ray distance technique for a sample of 24 clusters as compiled by de filippis _ et al . _",
    "the degenerescency on the @xmath2 parameter was broken using the baryon acoustic oscillation signature from the sdss catalog .",
    "the hubble constant was constrained to be @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath6 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "these limits were derived assuming elliptical @xmath23-model and a flat @xmath1cdm scenario .",
    "as we have seen , the baryon acoustic signature is an interesting tool for constraining directly the mass density parameter , @xmath16 , and , indirectly , it also improves the hubble constant limits acquired from other cosmological techniques ( like the sze / x - ray cluster distance ) . our hubble constant estimation using the",
    "joint analysis sze / x - ray + bao is largely consistent with some recent cosmological observations , like the third year of the wmap and the hst key project .",
    "implicitly , such an agreement suggests that the elliptical morphology describing the cluster sample and the associated isothermal @xmath23-model is quite realistic .",
    "it also reinforces the interest to the observational search of galaxy clusters in the near future , when more and larger samples , smaller statistic and systematic uncertainties will improve the limits on the present value of the hubble parameter .",
