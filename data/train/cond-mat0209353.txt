    "reaction - diffusion processes represent a large and important class of systems with nonequilibrium dynamics . from a fundamental physical viewpoint ,",
    "the interest in these systems lies in the fact that the concentration of reactants is governed , in general , by irreversible reaction events that depend on the spatial distribution of particles rather than through equilibrium fluctuations controlled by a chemical potential .",
    "such model systems have a range of applications , most notably to chemical kinetics @xcite but also to interfacial growth @xcite , domain coarsening @xcite and aggregation @xcite .",
    "the most intensively studied reactions are single - species annihilation ( @xmath13 ) and coalescence ( @xmath14 ) as well as two - species annihilation ( @xmath15)see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews . in this paper",
    "we focus on the two - species problem .",
    "it is known to exhibit two different classes of long - time behavior depending on whether the initial concentrations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles are equal or not .",
    "( as an aside , we note that a similar dependence on the initial condition also holds for the @xmath13 reaction when the reactant motion is deterministic rather than diffusive @xcite ) .",
    "the reason for this is that when the initial densities of @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles are the same , they remain so for all times , whereas if , say , the initial density of @xmath16 particles @xmath18 is less than that of the @xmath17 particles @xmath19 , the ratio @xmath20 as @xmath21 and at late times one has a few , isolated @xmath16 particles diffusing in a background of @xmath17 particles .",
    "the case of equal initial densities is well understood , and results similar to those for the @xmath13 with diffusive particle motion have been obtained @xcite . in low dimensions , here @xmath22 ,",
    "fluctuation effects are important and one finds a density decay @xmath23 in this _ diffusion - limited _ regime . above the critical dimension @xmath24",
    "one finds that the mean - field result @xmath25 applies .",
    "this result also holds for the @xmath13 process above its critical dimension @xmath26 .",
    "by contrast , the density decay forms for the @xmath15 process when the initial densities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are not equal are less well understood .",
    "in fact , since the exposition of the process as a model of monopole - antimonopole annihilation in the early universe nearly twenty years ago @xcite , only a few results are known exactly .",
    "most notably , bramson and lebowitz @xcite proved rigorously that , at large times , the density of the minority species ( which we will take to be the @xmath16 particles ) behaves as @xmath29 revealing @xmath10 to be critical in this case .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , no predictions for the constants @xmath30 were given until recently @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there has been no convincing numerical verification of the predicted decay even in one - dimension , despite the development of sophisticated simulation techniques @xcite that allow the probing of extremely small densities that emerge at large times . in this paper , we expand on the bounding arguments reported in @xcite that give rise to precise values of @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "we also present a detailed description of the simulation algorithm introduced in @xcite and extend it to test our bounding arguments and understand the approach to the asymptopia described by eq .",
    "( [ blresults ] ) .",
    "as noted above , the late - time regime is characterized by a few isolated @xmath16 particles diffusing in a sea of @xmath17 particles .",
    "thus it is appropriate to consider the extreme case of a single @xmath16 particle in a sea of @xmath17 particles that has a uniform ( poisson ) density . in this case , the quantity @xmath27 is just the _ survival probability _ of the @xmath16 particle .",
    "furthermore , if the diffusion constants of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles are the same , one can also view @xmath27 as the fraction of particles that have not met any other particles .",
    "thus the reaction @xmath32 in the limit of a low density of @xmath16 particles has been discussed under the guises of _ uninfected walkers _",
    "@xcite in which random walkers infect each other on contact , _ diffusion in the presence of traps _",
    "@xcite in which the @xmath17 particles are considered as traps for the @xmath16 particles , and _ predator - prey models _",
    "@xcite in which one asks for the survival of a prey ( the @xmath16 particle ) being ` chased ' by diffusing predators ( the @xmath17 particles ) . to avoid confusion",
    ", we shall adopt only the trapping terminology in our discussion .    in this work ,",
    "we show how the survival probability of a diffusing particle in the presence of mobile traps can be understood in terms of the _ target annihilation problem _ @xcite ( or first passage problem @xcite ) where one asks for the probability that none of the traps has entered a particular region ( target ) in the @xmath0-dimensional space . in turn , the asymptotics of the target annihilation problem are intimately related to the _ recurrence _ or _ transience _ of diffusion in various dimensions .",
    "a process is said to be recurrent if the probability of returning to the initial configuration is unity : in the context of diffusion , this implies that with probability one a walker will visit a particular point in space infinitely often .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g , @xcite ) that diffusion is recurrent in dimensions @xmath31 , whereas in more than two dimensions it is transient ( i.e.  the return probability is less than one ) .",
    "it is precisely this property of diffusion that gives rise to the critical dimension of two for the trapping reaction and hence the asymptotic results ( [ blresults ] ) for the @xmath15 process .",
    "the principal result of the paper is the determination of the constants @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ blresults ] ) for @xmath31 , and the derivation of upper and lower bounds for @xmath33 .",
    "a striking feature of the results is that , for @xmath31 , the value of @xmath30 is independent of the diffusion constant of the @xmath16 particle .",
    "we begin in the next section of this paper by defining the trapping reaction model .",
    "then , in section  [ 1danalysis ] we present in detail our analysis of the one - dimensional case , testing our predictions in section  [ numerics ] where we discuss how the model may be simulated efficiently . in section  [ generaldanalysis ] ,",
    "we show how the method used to treat the one - dimensional case can be extended to general dimensions @xmath34",
    ". only when the underlying diffusion process is recurrent ( i.e.  for @xmath35 ) do our upper and lower bounds converge asymptotically to give exact predictions for @xmath30 .",
    "finally , in section [ summary ] , we present a discussion and summary of the results .",
    "the trapping reaction model we consider is defined as follows . at time",
    "@xmath36 a particle is placed at the origin of a @xmath0-dimensional coordinate system . surrounding",
    "this particle is a uniform sea of traps whose initial positions @xmath37 are chosen independently .",
    "this initial condition ensures that the distribution of traps is poisson , i.e.  the probability that a volume @xmath38 contains @xmath39 traps is @xmath40 \\exp(-\\rho v)$ ] in which @xmath1 is the mean number of traps per unit volume .",
    "the dynamics of the particle and traps can be expressed using the langevin equation @xmath41 in which the subscript @xmath42 denotes the particle , @xmath43 one of the traps and the superscript @xmath44 indicates a component of the position vector @xmath37 .",
    "the noise @xmath45 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean and correlator @xmath46 we take all the traps to have a diffusion constant @xmath8 and the particle to have a diffusion constant @xmath47 .",
    "hence @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "the quantity of interest in this model is the probability @xmath2 , averaged over all initial conditions and realizations of the random walks , that the particle has not yet met any of the diffusing traps .",
    "for clarity , we restrict ourselves initially to the case @xmath12 . later ,",
    "in section  [ generaldanalysis ] we will explain how the arguments presented in detail here can be generalized to higher dimensions .",
    "we begin with a description of the target annihilation problem before moving on to discuss how it applies to the more general problem of a particle s survival in a sea of diffusing traps .",
    "the target annihilation problem can be solved exactly for any @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic form of the solution , and the leading corrections to it ( for @xmath34 ) , play a central role in our bounding arguments . to establish the notation and to make our presentation",
    "self - contained , we present in this paper a brief derivation of the main results as a prelude to deriving the bounds .      consider a one - dimensional line containing a target of length @xmath51 centered on the origin ( i.e.  lying between @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "we wish to calculate the probability @xmath54 that none of the diffusing traps initially placed outside this region has hit the target by a time @xmath3 .",
    "this quantity can be calculated if one knows the probability @xmath55 that a trap initially at position @xmath56 has not yet entered the target region .",
    "since the target is static and each trap executes independent diffusion , we can simply multiply the probabilities for each individual trap together and average over all possible initial positions to find @xmath54 .",
    "let us consider then a trap that has its initial position to the right of the target , i.e.  @xmath57 .",
    "the probability @xmath55 that the trap has not reached the target satisfies the backward fokker - planck equation @xmath58 with the boundary conditions @xmath59 , @xmath60 if @xmath57 and @xmath61 .",
    "these express the facts that the probability that the target has been reached if the trap started at @xmath62 is one , that it is reached in zero time from @xmath57 is zero and that it is reached from infinity _ in a finite time _ is zero respectively .",
    "the solution to ( [ bfpe1 ] ) that satisfies these boundary conditions is @xmath63 in which @xmath64 is the error function .    instead of a single trap to the right of the target ,",
    "consider @xmath39 independently diffusing traps , each initially placed at random in the interval @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "then , the probability that none of the traps has reached the target by time @xmath3 is @xmath66 it is convenient now to rewrite the error function in terms of the complementary error function , @xmath67 . then one has @xmath68^n \\;.\\ ] ] since we wish to consider an infinite sea of traps , we take @xmath69 and then the limit @xmath70 holding @xmath1 , the density of traps , fixed . this yields @xmath71^{\\rho l } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\exp \\left ( -\\frac{2 \\rho \\sqrt{dt}}{\\sqrt{\\pi } } \\right ) \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this gives the probability that no traps initially positioned on one side of the target have reached the target by time @xmath3 . since we have in mind a target surrounded on both sides by traps , and that the motion on each side is independent , we obtain the probability that the target has not been annihilated by a trap by squaring ( [ 1doneside ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath72 note that the size of the one - dimensional target @xmath73 does not appear in this exact expression for its survival probability .",
    "later , in section  [ generaldanalysis ] , we will find that at suitably large times , the size of the target is unimportant for all @xmath74 ( where diffusion is recurrent ) .",
    "we now discuss how to construct upper and lower bounds on the particle s survival probability @xmath2 using the result for the target annihilation problem ( [ qt1d ] ) in one dimension .",
    "we claim that , on average , a particle surrounded by a uniform , isotropic distribution of traps survives longer if it is stationary than if it is allowed to diffuse .",
    "we are currently unable to prove this statement rigorously , although it is supported by intuition and numerical data ( see section  [ numerics ] below ) .",
    "we also note that when we say `` on average '' we mean `` after averaging over all possible initial trap positions and trajectories of both particle and traps '' .    if this claim is accepted , we obtain an upper bound @xmath75 on the particle s survival probability from @xmath76 by noting that requiring the particle to remain stationary is equivalent to having a target region of size @xmath77 .",
    "then we immediately have that @xmath78    to derive a lower bound on the survival probability @xmath2 we introduce a notional box of size @xmath73 centered on the origin .",
    "if we ask for the particle to remain inside this box until a time @xmath3 , and for all the traps to remain outside it , the traps and particle may never meet and hence the particle survives until time @xmath3 .",
    "there are , of course , other trajectories for which the particle survives , and so those just described form a subset of all possible surviving trajectories  see fig .",
    "[ subset ] .",
    "hence the probability that the particle remains within the box and traps outside is a lower bound @xmath79 on @xmath2 .",
    "two walker trajectories ( space - time plots , with @xmath36 at the bottom ) for which the particle ( unfilled ) survives contact with a trap .",
    "trajectories of type ( i ) have the property that the particle remains inside a notional box , and the traps outside .",
    "this forms a subset of the entire class of surviving trajectories , which includes paths of type ( ii ) in which the particle leaves the box and the traps enter but nevertheless no particle - trap contact occurs . ]    there are three independent contributions to this bound : ( i ) the probability that there are initially no traps in the box of size @xmath73 ; ( ii ) the probability that no traps enter the box up to time @xmath3 ; and ( iii ) the probability that the particle has not left the box up to time @xmath3 .",
    "the first two contributions are easily obtained . from the definition of the poisson distribution",
    ", we have that the probability the box initially contains no traps is @xmath80 .",
    "secondly , the probability that no traps enter the box is independent of the box size and is given by ( [ qt1d ] ) .",
    "the third contribution , the probability that the particle remains inside the box , is obtained as follows .",
    "since the system is translationally invariant , we can just as easily consider a particle initially sandwiched between absorbing boundaries at @xmath81 and @xmath53 .",
    "the probability @xmath82 that the particle starting at @xmath83 has not crossed the absorbing boundaries satisfies a backward fokker - planck equation @xmath84 subject to the absorbing boundary conditions @xmath85 and the initial condition @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "the general solution to this equation that satisfies the absorbing boundary conditions is obtained by separating the time and space variables in the usual way .",
    "one obtains the fourier sine series @xmath88 the expansion coefficients @xmath89 are fixed through the initial condition . using the orthogonality of the sine functions",
    "one finds @xmath90 0 & \\mbox{$k$ even } \\end{array } \\right . \\;.\\ ] ]    for the purposes of the present calculation , we need consider only the long - time form of @xmath82 for a particle that starts at @xmath91 .",
    "thus we keep only the longest - lived ( @xmath92 ) mode in the expansion ( [ qpsin ] ) to find @xmath93 including this along with the contributions to the lower bound @xmath79 on the diffusing particle s survival probability @xmath2 discussed above , we have @xmath94 once the time @xmath3 is sufficiently large .",
    "note that this provides a bound for a particular box size @xmath73 . since the box is an artificial construct , we can choose its size so that the lower bound is maximized at a particular ( predetermined ) time @xmath95 .",

    "( [ qu1d ] ) we find @xmath98 this implies that the constant @xmath99 in the expressions of bramson and lebowitz ( [ blresults ] ) is precisely determined as @xmath100 note that this constant depends only on the density and diffusion constant of the traps , and is independent of the diffusion constant of the particle .",
    "it is straightforward to incorporate two generalizations of the one - dimensional trapping model defined in section [ moddef ] into the bounding arguments discussed above .",
    "the first of these is to allow the traps to the left and right of the origin at time @xmath101 to have different densities .",
    "we denote the larger ( respectively , smaller ) of these densities as @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) and their average as @xmath104 .",
    "additionally we shall place @xmath105 particles at the origin at time @xmath101 and study the probability that _ all _ survive until a time @xmath3 .    to obtain an upper bound on the survival probability",
    ", we note that the survival probability of the particles can only increase ( or remain constant ) as either @xmath102 or @xmath103 is decreased .",
    "hence the survival probability for the case of unequal densities is bounded from above by the case where the density of traps is on both sides equal to @xmath103 . for the case of a single diffusing particle , we argued above that an upper bound on its survival probability is found by setting its diffusion constant @xmath47 to @xmath101 . clearly , if @xmath106 the number of particles at the origin is irrelevant , and so an upper bound on @xmath2 is given by eq .",
    "( [ qu1d ] ) with @xmath107 , i.e. , @xmath108    to obtain a lower bound on the particles survival probability we once again introduce a notional box , inside which all the particles must remain and no traps may enter until time @xmath3 . this time",
    ", however , we respect the asymmetry of the problem by allowing the box to extend a distance @xmath109 into the low - density region of traps and @xmath110 into the high - density region .",
    "we will again seek to maximize the lower bound by varying @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "a lower bound @xmath79 is obtained using an argument analogous to that leading to eq .",

    "the maximal lower bound for a prescribed time @xmath95 is obtained from ( [ nlower1 ] ) by setting @xmath114 to zero ( thus discounting particle trajectories that enter the high - density region ) and putting @xmath115 . then @xmath116^{1/3 } \\right ) \\;.\\ ] ] along with the upper bound ( [ nupper ] ) we find that @xmath117 note that , except for the case where @xmath118 ( which implies @xmath119 ) these two bounds do not converge and so we can not make a precise prediction for @xmath120 when the trap densities are unequal . for the case",
    "@xmath121 , however , the bounds converge to @xmath122 , independent of the number of particles @xmath105 .",
    "a sophisticated algorithm for simulating the trapping reaction in discrete space and time and with a poisson distribution of traps was recently introduced @xcite .",
    "the beauty of the algorithm is that it admits ( numerically ) exact calculation of the survival probability for an arbitrarily long , but fixed , trajectory of the particle .",
    "as will be discussed below , the algorithm takes into account all possible paths of the traps , as long as their initial distribution is poisson . in order to obtain an estimate of the particle survival probability ,",
    "it is necessary to iterate the algorithm over a sequence of particle paths .",
    "we now discuss this algorithm in detail .      in order to simulate the trapping reaction model in one dimension",

    "note that ( [ discretede ] ) is the discrete analogue of the diffusion ( fokker - planck ) equation @xmath133 by taylor expanding ( [ discretede ] ) we find the diffusion constant of both particle and trap to be @xmath134 .",
