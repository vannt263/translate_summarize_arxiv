    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has so far not seen any signal of new physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) . on the other hand atlas and cms",
    "have recently observed a new state consistent with a standard - model - like higgs boson at @xmath4 gev @xcite , which is within the range for it to be consistent with the lightest higgs in supersymmetric models . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the light higgs mass at tree - level is bounded from above by the @xmath5 boson mass ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the large radiative contributions from stops needed to raise it to the observed value typically imply very large fine - tuning .",
    "conventional @xmath1 inspired susy models involve both a singlet generated @xmath7 term , denoted @xmath8 , and a massive @xmath0 gauge boson at the tev scale .",
    "such models can increase the tree level physical higgs boson mass above the @xmath6 limit of the mssm , due to both f - term contributions of the singlet and the d - term contributions associated with the @xmath0 , allowing lighter stop masses and hence reducing fine - tuning due to stop loops . the exceptional supersymmetric standard model ( e@xmath9ssm ) @xcite is an example of such a model , inspired by the @xmath1 group .",
    "it involves an extra singlet responsible for @xmath8 and an extra @xmath10 gauge symmetry at low energy , giving both new f - term and d - term contributions at tree level to the light higgs mass , which is larger than both the mssm and the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm)@xcite . in the e@xmath9ssm the light higgs mass is given by , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the ratio between the two higgs doublets vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) , @xmath13 is the yukawa coupling of the singlet field to the higgs doublets , the extra @xmath3 gauge group has a gauge coupling @xmath14 and @xmath15 represents loop corrections .",
    "eq.[mh ] exhibits two extra terms proportional to @xmath16 , relative to the mssm , which contribute at tree level to the higgs mass squared .",
    "this means that the e@xmath9ssm permits lower stop masses than in the mssm ( or the nmssm ) corresponding to lower values required for the radiative correction term @xmath15 .",
    "however , as we shall discuss , one of the minimisation conditions of the e@xmath9ssm can be written in the form , [ mz0 ] c = -_^2 + + d , where @xmath17 are functions of @xmath18 which are of order @xmath19 , @xmath20 are soft higgs mass squared parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath22 arise from the singlet vev @xmath23 . written in this form it is clear that there is a new source of tree - level fine - tuning , due to the @xmath0 mass squared term in eq.[mz0 ] , which will increases quadratically as @xmath24 , eventually coming to dominate the fine - tuning for large enough values of @xmath25 .",
    "this tree - level fine - tuning can be compared to that due to @xmath26 which typically requires this quantity to be not much more than 200 gev , and similar limits also apply to @xmath25 . with the current cms experimental mass limit for the @xmath0 in the e@xmath9ssm of @xmath27 tev",
    "@xcite it is clear that there is already a significant , perhaps dominant , amount of fine - tuning due to the @xmath0 mass limit , and furthermore this source of fine - tuning increasing quadratically with @xmath25 will rapidly overtake the logarithmic fine - tuning due to the stop mass limits , as the experimental mass limits of both types of particles increases in the future .",
    "this was first pointed out in @xcite and has been discussed quantitatively @xcite in the framework of the constrained e@xmath9ssm @xcite , where it has been verified that this new source of fine - tuning dominates over all other sources .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new class of models called little @xmath0 models which differ from the usual class of @xmath1 models by having a reduced gauge coupling @xmath14 leading to the possibility of lower mass @xmath0 bosons .",
    "such a reduction in the gauge coupling @xmath14 at the unification scale has some motivation from f - theory constructions @xcite .",
    "we show that reducing @xmath14 relaxes the experimental limit on the @xmath0 mass , allowing a lighter value and hence reducing the tree - level fine - tuning associated with @xmath1 models .",
    "we show that , although for sufficiently small values of @xmath14 the new source of fine - tuning due to the @xmath0 mass can be essentially eliminated , it does so at the expense of increasing the singlet vacuum expectation value , leading to overall fine - tuning similar to that in the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "we emphasise that the main prediction of little @xmath0 models is the presence of weakly coupled low mass @xmath0 resonances , perhaps as low as 200 gev .",
    "the layout of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the e@xmath9ssm , followed by a discussion of the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) conditions and the impact of the @xmath0 mass on fine - tuning in section 3 .",
    "little @xmath0 models are introduced in section 4 , where the experimental limits on such a boson are studied as a function of its mass and ( reduced ) gauge coupling .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper .",
    "at low energies , the group structure of the exceptional supersymmetric standard model ( e@xmath9ssm ) is that of the standard model ( sm ) , along with the additional @xmath28 symmetry ,    @xmath29    the matter content of the model is contained in the complete 27-dimensional representation which decomposes under @xmath30 to ,    @xmath31    ordinary quarks and leptons are contained in the representations : @xmath32 and @xmath33 the higgs doublets and exotic quarks are contained in @xmath34 and @xmath35 the singlets are contained in @xmath36 , and finally the right handed neutrinos are included in @xmath37    moreover , the model requires three 27 representations , hence @xmath38 , in order to ensure anomaly cancellation .",
    "this means that there are three copies of each field present in the model .",
    "however , only the third generation ( by choice ) of the two higgs doublets , and the sm singlet acquire vevs .",
    "the other two generations are called : inert . furthermore , in order to keep gauge coupling unification , non - higgs fields that come from extra incomplete @xmath39 representations are added to the model . as a result , a @xmath40 term , which is not necessary related to the weak scale , is present in the model .",
    "the full superpotential consistent with the low energy gauge structure of the e@xmath9ssm contains includes both @xmath1 invariant invariant terms and @xmath1 breaking terms , full details of which are given in @xcite .    to prevent proton decay and flavour changing neutral currents a discrete @xmath41 symmetry is imposed .",
    "all superfields except the third generation higgs doublets and singlet are odd under this symmetry .",
    "the @xmath41 invariant superpotential then reads ,    @xmath42 & & + \\dfrac{1}{2}m_{ij}\\hat{n}^c_i\\hat{n}^c_j+\\mu'(\\hat{h}'\\hat{\\overline{h'}})+ h^{e}_{4j}(\\hat{h}_d \\hat{h}')\\hat{e}^c_j+h_{4j}^n ( \\hat{h}_{u } \\hat{h}')\\hat{n}_j^c   \\nonumber \\\\[2 mm ] & & + w_{\\rm{mssm}}(\\mu=0 ) , \\label{eq : suppot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the indices @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the generations .",
    "@xmath45 is the sm singlet field , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the higgs doublet fields corresponding to the up and down types .",
    "exotic quarks and the additional non - higgs fields are denoted by @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .    finally to ensure that only third generation higgs like fields get vevs a certain hierarchy between the yukawa couplings must exist .",
    "defining @xmath50 , we impose @xmath51 .",
    "the scalar higgs potential is , @xmath52 + \\delta_{\\text{loops } } } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the gauge couplings of @xmath56 ( gut normalized ) , and the additional @xmath28 , respectively . @xmath57 and @xmath58 are effective @xmath28 charges of @xmath59 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "@xmath60 is the mass of the singlet field , and @xmath61 .",
    "the higgs field and the sm singlet acquire vevs at the physical minimum of this potential ,    @xmath62     + it is reasonable exploit the fact that @xmath63 , which will help in simplifying our master formula for fine - tuning as will be seen in section 4 .",
    "then , from the minimisation conditions ,    @xmath64    the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) conditions are ,    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "eq.[mz ] can be written , @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 if one takes @xmath73 we have @xmath74 and the factor in front of @xmath75 in is equal to one and we recover the well known mssm relation between @xmath76 , @xmath77 and the soft higgs masses @xmath78 , @xmath79 .",
    "written in this form , which may be compared to eq.[mz0 ] but with the coefficients @xmath17 explicitly given , it is clear that fine - tuning will increase quadratically as @xmath25 increases .    to avoid any fine - tuning we would like to keep @xmath80 gev or less",
    "this motivates the main idea of this paper , namely to relax the cms experimental mass limit of @xmath27 tev @xcite down to @xmath81 gev by reducing its gauge coupling @xmath14 . indeed , as we shall see , such a low value of @xmath81 gev may be made consistent with the experimental limit by choosing @xmath82 and @xmath83 tev . in order to keep @xmath84 close to the electroweak scale",
    "this requires a very small value of @xmath85 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : finetuning ] the contribution @xmath86 to fine - tuning from @xmath87 is plotted , where @xmath86 is defined as follows .",
    "@xmath88     mass . ]",
    "we emphasise that the appearance of @xmath25 in the tree - level minimisation condition is characteristic of all susy @xmath0 models where the usual higgs doublets carry @xmath3 charges ( e.g. it applies to all @xmath1 models but not , for example the @xmath89 model . )",
    "this provides a motivation for little @xmath0 models in which the extra gauge coupling @xmath14 is reduced and the experimental lower bound on @xmath25 may be relaxed .",
    "in general little @xmath0 models can be defined by the gauge group su(3)_csu(2)_lu(1)_y u ( 1)^[low ] where the standard model is augmented by an additional @xmath90 gauge group with a gauge coupling @xmath14 which is significantly smaller than the hypercharge gauge coupling @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath2 gauge group is broken at low energies giving rise to a massive @xmath92 gauge boson with couplings to a sm fermion @xmath93 given by @xcite : @xmath94 the values of @xmath95 depend on the particular choice of @xmath90 and on the particular fermion @xmath93 .",
    "we assume universality amongst the three families .",
    "more explicitly , this assumption implies that @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 for up - quarks , down - quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos respectively .",
    "the axial couplings , @xmath100 , behave accordingly .    in a given model",
    "there are eight model dependent couplings of the extra @xmath92 boson to sm fermions , that is @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "these are fixed by group theory , so can not be changed for a given model",
    ". however the low energy @xmath3 gauge coupling @xmath14 is fixed by a unification condition .",
    "e.g. in e@xmath9ssm @xmath103 which is approximately equal to the ( gut normalised ) hypercharge gauge coupling .",
    "if unification of @xmath14 with the other gauge couplings is relaxed , then @xmath14 becomes a free parameter . in this paper",
    "we are interested in taking it to be smaller than the gut prediction , namely we shall consider @xmath104 , keeping @xmath95 fixed at their model predictions .    specializing to the charged lepton pair production cross - section relevant for the first runs at the lhc , the cross - section may be written at the leading order ( lo ) as @xcite : _",
    "^+^-^lo = [ eq : ll ] where the coefficients @xmath105 and @xmath106 are given by : c_u=(g_v^u^2+g_a^u^2)br(^+^- ) ,  c_d=(g_v^d^2+g_a^d^2)br(^+^- ) , [ eq : cucd ] and @xmath107 and @xmath108 are related to the parton luminosities @xmath109 and @xmath110 and therefore only depend on the collider energy and the @xmath0 mass .",
    "all the model dependence of the cross - section is therefore contained in the two coefficients , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "these parameters can be calculated from @xmath111 and @xmath14 , assuming only sm decays of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "note that the cross - section is proportional to @xmath112 and will therefore be reduced in little @xmath0 models in which @xmath104 .    a given model such as the e@xmath9ssm @xcite appears as a point in the @xmath113 plane , assuming that the low energy @xmath3 gauge coupling @xmath14 is fixed by a unification condition .",
    "if we relax the unification condition then the point will become a line in the @xmath113 plane , since each of @xmath105 and @xmath106 are proportional to @xmath112 and the points on the line will approach the origin as @xmath114 . for example in the e@xmath9ssm we have : c_u = 5.9410 ^ -4 ^ 2 ,   c_d = 1.4810 ^ -3 ^ 2 .",
    "[ cucdgp ] since the experimental @xmath0 mass contours in the @xmath113 plane are fixed for a given limit on the cross - section , the effect of reducing @xmath14 will not change those contours",
    ". the only effect of reducing @xmath14 is to move the model point in the @xmath113 plane closer to the origin , resulting in a reduced experimental limit on the @xmath0 mass .",
    "see for example @xcite where this approach is followed for conventional @xmath0 models .",
    "although this provides a simple way to understand qualitatively why the experimental limits are relaxed by reducing @xmath14 , it turns out that for the lower mass @xmath0 signal regions backgrounds and other constraints become more important for this reason we shall not present our results in the @xmath113 plane .    in the e@xmath9ssm",

    "the last approximation in eq.[zpmass ] assumes @xmath118 where we can neglect the terms involving the electroweak vev @xmath119 gev .",
    "what is the effect of reducing @xmath14 in this model ?",
    "on the one hand , reducing @xmath14 will reduce @xmath25 in direct proportion , since @xmath120 for a fixed value of @xmath23 .",
