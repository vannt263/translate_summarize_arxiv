    "3c  120 ( z=0.033 , michel & huchra 1988 ) is classified both as a seyfert  1 active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and a broad line radio galaxy ( blrg ) . here",
    "we discuss the serendipitous discovery of an o  viii  ly@xmath1 absorption signature in the 3c  120 spectrum , likely due to whigm along the line of sight .",
    "we observed 3c  120 with the _ hetgs _ on board _ chandra _ on 2001 december 21 for @xmath14  ks , beginning at ut 11:13:52 .",
    "the _ hetgs _ consists of two grating assemblies , a high - energy grating ( heg ) and a medium - energy grating ( meg ) . only the summed , @xmath15 order _ chandra _ grating spectra were used in our analysis .",
    "we found the counts distribution as a function of cross - dispersion angle could be approximated by a gaussian model with widths in the range @xmath16 for the @xmath17 orders of the meg .",
    "this gaussian model is consistent with a point source , although there is emission of @xmath18 peak emission at @xmath19 , possibly due to the extended jet .",
    "we accumulated grating spectra along the dispersion direction and within @xmath20 of the peak in the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "the mean meg and heg total count rates were @xmath21 and @xmath22 cts / s respectively .",
    "we extracted spectra and spectral responses exactly as described in yaqoob _",
    "( 2003 ) and obtained a net exposure time of 57,224 s ( including a deadtime factor of 0.01618 ) . during the observation 3c  120 did not vary much ; the light - curve yielded an excess variance of @xmath23 ( turner _ et al .",
    "since the heg bandpass only extends down to @xmath24 kev we use the meg as the primary instrument .",
    "we used @xmath25-statistic for finding best - fit model parameters , and quote 90@xmath26 confidence , one - parameter statistical errors .",
    "the harder spectrum , including the fe - k emission line will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the acis ccds have been undergoing a low - energy qe degradation , due to absorption by contaminants .",
    "there is a model of the contamination pertinent for pure acis data ( without the gratings ) .",
    "we can use this model as a ` worst case ' to estimate the effects on the continuum .",
    "thus , we will give results with and without corrections using the acis qe degradation model in xspec v11.2 ( acisabs ) , using default absorption by the contaminants c , h , o , and n in the ratio 10:20:2:1 by number of atoms .",
    "all spectral fits were done in the 0.55  kev energy band , excluding the 2.02.5 kev region , which suffers from systematics due to limitations in the calibration of the x - ray telescope .",
    "first we fitted spectra binned coarsely at @xmath27a , in order to compare with previous ccd spectra . a simple model consisting only of a single power  law ( @xmath28 ) and galactic absorption of @xmath29 ( elvis , lockman & wilkes 1989 ) fit the data adequately , with residuals @xmath30 30 @xmath26 over the fitted energy band . the inverted photon spectrum and residuals",
    "are shown in fig .  1 . the residuals at @xmath31 0.8 kev",
    "coincide with sharp changes in effective area and are likely due to the limitations of the calibration . including the acis degradation model requires a soft excess in the data , which we modeled as a broken power",
    "we found a best - fit soft x - ray index of @xmath32 , a hard x - ray index of @xmath33 and a break energy of @xmath34 kev .",
    "we compared our data with previous ccd observations by modeling the meg data with two absorption edges and a single power law ( and galactic absorption ) .",
    "we find threshold optical depths of @xmath35 and @xmath36 at @xmath37 confidence for o  vii and o  viii respectively .",
    "these small optical depths do not alter the power - law index .",

    "the feature at @xmath12 kev remains unidentified since all absorption transitions considered for this feature should yield strong absorption features elsewhere in the spectrum .",
    "for all spectral fitting hereafter we use a binsize of @xmath42a ( @xmath45 meg fwhm resolution ) . since there are bins with zero counts in the o  viii  ly@xmath1 feature , the data are of limited statistical quality , modeling the absorption profile with a voigt function is not warranted .",
    "therefore we modeled the profile with a simple window function , whereby over an energy interval @xmath46 , centered on some energy , @xmath47 , a fraction @xmath48 , of the continuum is absorbed .",
    "table  1 shows the results of spectral fitting the o  viii  ly@xmath1 profile .",

    "the o  viii  ly@xmath1 profile parameters are not strongly influenced by acis degradation and the c  statistic improves by @xmath49 upon the addition of the absorption - line model ( which corresponds to @xmath50 significance for three additional parameters ) .",
    "the o  viii  ly@xmath1 feature has fwhm@xmath2 km @xmath3 , ew@xmath51 ev and is strongly blueshifted ( @xmath52 km @xmath3 ) from 3c  120 systemic velocity . the absorption occurs at @xmath5 if it is due to intervening whigm . o  viii  ly@xmath53 absorption is not statistically significant ( ew@xmath54 ev ) when the data are fit with a gaussian model with the same fwhm and @xmath55 as o  viii  ly@xmath1 in table  1 .",
    "we tested the data for o  vii ( r ) , ne  ix ( r ) and ne  x  ly@xmath1 absorption in the same way and found ew@xmath304.12 ev and @xmath301.78 ev for o  vii ( r ) and ne  x  ly@xmath1 respectively .",
    "there is weak evidence of ne  ix ( r ) _ emission _ so we could not find a meaningful upper limit on the absorption ew for this feature .",
    "an independent confirmation of the significance of the o  viii  ly@xmath1 feature was obtained as follows . from the best - fitting continuum , the instrument effective area , and the exposure time",
    ", we estimated if there were _ no _ absorption feature we should expect a mean of 13.8 photons in the fitted energy interval containing the feature ( table  1 ) .",
    "we observed 2 photons in this energy interval ( 13 bins out of 126 over the range @xmath56 to @xmath57 ) .",
    "the poisson probability of obtaining this result is @xmath58 so the confidence level of the detection of the feature is @xmath0 ( i.e. @xmath50 ) .",
    "we verified this result by performing @xmath59 simulations of the continuum , with _ no _ absorption feature .",
    "we note that a 9% decrease in the level of the continuum is allowed before the detection significance of the absorption feature drops below @xmath60 .",
    "both the o  viii  ly@xmath1 and 0.71 kev absorption features are detected separately in the -1 and + 1 arms of the meg .",
    "absorption models improved the c  statistic by @xmath61 for o  viii  ly@xmath1 and by @xmath62 for the @xmath31 0.71kev feature in the @xmath63 arms respectively .",
    "thus it is extremely unlikely that either feature is due to a statistical fluctuation since the probabilities above do not take into account detections in _ both _ arms of the meg .",
    "2  ( c ) shows a velocity spectrum centered on the o  viii  ly@xmath1 feature .",

    "frame velocities at @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "the o  viii  ly@xmath1 is blueshifted by @xmath64 km @xmath3 from 3c  120 systemic velocity ( @xmath57 ) and there may be absorption at @xmath65 km @xmath3 in fig .  2  ( c ) , close to @xmath56 , presumably due to a hot medium in the local group , as observed elsewhere ( eg nicastro _ et al .",
