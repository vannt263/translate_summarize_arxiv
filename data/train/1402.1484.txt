    "given a graph @xmath1 with @xmath2 and a collection of edge lengths @xmath3 , a euclidean embedding of @xmath4 in @xmath0 is a mapping of its vertices to a set of points @xmath5 , such that @xmath6 , for all @xmath7 .",
    "we call a graph ( generically ) rigid in @xmath0 iff , for generic edge lengths , it can be embedded in @xmath0 in a finite number of ways , modulo rigid transformations ( translations and rotations ) .",
    "a graph is minimally rigid in @xmath0 iff it is no longer rigid once any edge is removed .",
    "the main goal is to determine the maximum number of distinct planar euclidean embeddings of minimally rigid graphs , up to rigid transformations , as a function of the number of vertices .    a graph @xmath1 is called laman",
    "if @xmath8 and , additionally , all of its vertex - induced subgraphs with @xmath9 vertices to have less than @xmath10 edges .",
    "it is a fundamental theorem that the class of laman graphs coincides with the generically minimally rigid graphs in the plane .",
    "a general upper bound on the number of embeddings , for the planar case , is @xmath11 .",
    "the bound was obtained by exploiting results from complex algebraic geometry that bound the degree of ( symmetric ) determinantal varieties defined by distance matrices @xcite . in @xcite ,",

    "this approach was used in order to determine an upper bound for the case of laman graphs with @xmath13 vertices  @xcite , which turns out to be tight .",
    "the same method led to a quite tight bound for the case @xmath14 in  @xcite .",
    "however , the approach , as applied in both cases , was not entirely correct , which led to different errors in these two proofs .",
    "our contribution is to rectify both proofs in the following sections .",
    "interestingly , the upper bound for @xmath15 is correct .    in table",
    "[ upb1 ] , we list the known upper bounds on the number of embeddings of rigid graphs with up to @xmath16 vertices , also presented in  @xcite .",
    "these results constitute an improvement over the results in  @xcite , as we now include the tight bound for @xmath17 .",
    "the bounds for @xmath18 are simply multiples by  4 of the respective bounds for @xmath19 .",

    "we will use a combinatorial characterization of rigidity in @xmath20 , which is based on laman graphs @xcite .",
    "a graph @xmath1 with @xmath2 is called laman iff @xmath21 and all of its induced subgraphs on @xmath22 vertices have @xmath23 edges .",
    "it is a fundamental theorem ( maxwell 1864 - laman 1970 ) that a graph is minimally rigid in @xmath20 iff it is a laman graph .",
    "moreover , we know that laman graphs admit inductive constructions that begin with a triangle , followed by a sequence of so - called henneberg steps ( henneberg constructions ) . a graph is laman iff it has a henneberg construction .",
    "each henneberg step adds to the graph a new vertex and a total number of two edges .    a henneberg-@xmath24 ( or @xmath25 ) step connects the new vertex to two existing vertices and it doubles the number of euclidean embeddings .     step ]    a hennenerg-@xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) step connects the new vertex to three existing vertices having at least one edge among them , and this edge is removed .",
    "step ]    a laman graph is called @xmath25 if it can be constructed using only @xmath25 steps and it is called @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "given a polynomial @xmath28 in @xmath29 variables , its support is the set of exponents in @xmath30 corresponding to nonzero terms . the newton polytope of @xmath28 is the convex hull of its support and lies in @xmath31 .",
    "consider the minkowski sum of the scaled polytopes @xmath32 .",
    "minkowski s theorem states that its n - dimensional euclidean volume is a polynomial in @xmath33 homogeneous , of degree n. the mixed volume is the coefficient of the monomial @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be a polynomial system in n variables with real coefficients , where the @xmath36 have fixed supports . then",
    ", the number of common isolated solutions in @xmath37 is bounded above by the mixed volume of ( the newton polytopes of ) the @xmath36 . this bound is tight for a generic choice of coefficients of the @xmath36 s .",
    "given a graph with @xmath29 vertices , the corresponding pre - distance matrix is a symmetric @xmath38 matrix @xmath39 , where @xmath40 . the corresponding cayley - menger matrix @xmath41 is a symmetric @xmath42 matrix @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 for @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a cayley - menger matrix as defined before .",
    "then @xmath43 corresponds to a graph embeddable in @xmath49 if    * rank@xmath50 , * @xmath51 , @xmath52 ,    where @xmath53 is any minor of @xmath43 indexed by @xmath54 .    in other words , @xmath53 must also be cayley - menger .",
    "the second condition yields inequalities .",
    "for instance , for @xmath55 it yields the fact that all distances must be positive and for @xmath56 it yields the triangular inequality . the first condition implies the vanishing of all @xmath57 cayley - menger minors .",
    "we use this condition in order to construct well - constrained square systems whose roots correspond to euclidean distance matrix completions of @xmath43 . note that these systems do not contain all of the unknown variables but they uniquely define the ones not contained .    hence , an upper bound in the number of roots is equivalent to an upper bound in the number of euclidean embeddings modulo rigid transformations and reflection .",
    "multiplying by @xmath26 yields an upper bound in the number of euclidean embeddings modulo rigid transformations .",
    "this fact was not taken into consideration in @xcite",
    ". however , the upper bounds obtained here are actually the same with @xcite , a fact that lead us to the conjecture that there exist systems that count the exact number of euclidean embeddings modulo rigid transformations .",
    "we apply the aforementioned approach in the desargues framework which is known to have @xmath59 euclidean embeddings in the plane .",
    "the corresponding cayley - menger matrix is the following : @xmath60    we are now able to find at least one subsystem that satisfies the laman property and hence it has finitely many roots .",
    "the following @xmath61 system also uniquely defines the rest of the unknown variables .",
    "@xmath62@xmath63@xmath64 this system has mixed volume equal to @xmath65 . in other words",
    ", it yields at most @xmath65 complex roots .",
    "hence , @xmath65 is an upper bound on the euclidean embeddings modulo rigid transformations and reflection .",
    "taking symmetry into account , we have at most 24 euclidean embeddings modulo rigid transformations .    another case of interest",
    "is that of the complete bipartite graph with @xmath66 vertices .",
    "the corresponding cayley - menger matrix is the following : @xmath67 we choose the following system which satisfies the abovementioned properties : @xmath68@xmath69@xmath70 this system has mixed volume equal to @xmath71 which yields an upper bound of @xmath72 in the number of euclidean embeddings modulo rigid transformations .",
    "this case was first studied in @xcite .",
    "however , the property that an embedding and its mirror image preserve distances between points , was not taken into account .",
    "however , although we provide a new and correct proof , the same results are eventually obtained .    among all laman graphs ,",
    "there are only @xmath73 @xmath27 graphs , we have to consider .",
    "all @xmath25 graphs have @xmath74 euclidean embeddings .",
    "we can obtain an upper bound of @xmath75 and @xmath76 euclidean embeddings for the two of these graphs . the @xmath27 graph with",
    "the highest number of euclidean embeddings is the following :    the corresponding cayley - menger matrix is the following : @xmath77 we can obtain an upper bound for this graph from the following system .",
    "@xmath78@xmath63@xmath79@xmath64 its mixed volume equals to @xmath80 .",
    "hence , we obtain an upper bound of @xmath81 euclidean embeddings .",
    "the case of graphs with @xmath82 vertices was studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors conclude that the upper bound follows from the upper bound of @xmath83 specific @xmath27 graphs .",
    "unfortunately , the systems used in order to determine the number of embeddings for these @xmath83 graphs do not satisfy the laman property .",
    "hence , the final result in @xcite is not correct . in the following paragraphs , we present the difficulties we faced while trying to correct this error , and we make a conjecture about the actual upper bound on the number of euclidean embeddings modulo rigid transformations in the case of laman graphs with 8 vertices .",
    "notice that the systems which provide us with upper bounds in the case of graphs with @xmath66 and @xmath13 vertices , are of size @xmath84 , where @xmath29 denotes the number of vertices .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of graphs with @xmath82 vertices , there are graphs for which , we can only obtain systems of size @xmath85 .",
    "the mixed volume of these systems , multiplied by @xmath26 is not representative of the maximum number of euclidean embeddings .",
    "however , experiments show that these systems take into account reflection and count the number of euclidean embeddings modulo rigid transformations . in other words",
    ", we conjecture that we do not have to multiply by @xmath26 , the mixed volume we obtain from some bigger systems .",
    "we expect this to happen for general @xmath29 .",
    "however , this is only a conjecture .    in table ( [ res8 ] ) , we present the mixed volumes obtained by systems that are of size @xmath85 and also satisfy the laman property for the abovementioned @xmath83 graphs .",
    "hence , we expect that the upper bound on the number of embeddings for laman graphs with @xmath82 vertices is @xmath86 , while the current upper bound is @xmath87 .",
    "the most relative open problem to our work is to understand whether there exist systems that take also into account reflection .",
    "if we prove that systems like the ones used for the results of table [ [ res8 ] ] , count also embeddings produced by reflection of other embeddings , we will have an upper bound for the graphs with @xmath82 vertices .    undoubtedly , the most important and oldest problem in rigidity theory is the full combinatorial characterization of rigid graphs in @xmath88 . in the planar case ,",
    "existing bounds are not tight .",
    "this is due to the fact that root counts include rotated copies of certain embeddings .",
    "a related problem is to derive an algorithmic process for obtaining good algebraic representations , e.g. for producing low mixed volumes .",
    "distance matrices may offer such a general approach , including the spatial case . for high @xmath29",
    "the issue is that the number of equations produced is quite large , with algebraic dependancies among them .",
    "since we deal with henneberg constructions , it is important to determine the effect of each step on the number of embeddings : a @xmath25 step always doubles their number ; we conjecture that @xmath27 multiplies it by @xmath89 and spatial @xmath90 by @xmath91 , but these may not always be tight .",
    "our conjecture has been verified for small @xmath29 .",
