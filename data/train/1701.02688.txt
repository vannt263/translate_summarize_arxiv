    "the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xmath3 , and two - body distribution amplitudes ( das ) @xmath4 are related to matrix elements of bilocal operators on the light cone @xmath5 , which prevents a straightforward calculation of these functions in a lattice gauge theory formulated in the euclidean space .",
    "the usual way out is to calculate their moments . in particular , high precision lattice calculations of the second moment of the pion distribution amplitude @xmath6 were reported in ref .",
    "however , recently , x. ji @xcite suggested a method allowing to calculate pdfs and das as functions of @xmath7 . to this end , he proposes to use purely space - like separations @xmath8 .",
    "the matrix elements of equal - time bilocal operators produce distributions @xmath9 in the momentum @xmath2 component ( quasi - distributions ) .",
    "the crucial point is that they tend to the light - cone distributions @xmath10 , @xmath11 in the limit . in case of pdfs , the results of lattice calculations of the parton quasi - distributions ( pqds ) were reported in refs .",
    "it is expected @xcite that pqds @xmath9 should have a mild perturbative evolution with respect to @xmath2 for large @xmath2 .",
    "however , the values of @xmath2 used in the cited lattice calculations are not very large , and the observed strong variation of pqds with @xmath2 does not have a perturbative form .",
    "in our recent paper @xcite we have studied nonperturbative evolution of pqds using the formalism of _ virtuality distribution functions _ @xcite .",
    "we found that pqds can be obtained from the transverse momentum dependent distributions ( tmds ) @xmath12 .",
    "then we built models for the nonperturbative evolution of pqds using simple models for tmds .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with the @xmath2-evolution patterns obtained in lattice calculations @xcite and also in diquark spectator models    as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , because of the relation between pqds and tmds , the nonperturbative evolution of pqds reflects the @xmath13-dependence of the tmds @xmath12 , and thus its study provides a new approach to the investigation of the 3-dimensional structure of hadrons .    our goal in the present paper is to perform a similar analysis of the pion _ quasi - distribution amplitude _ ( qda ) @xmath1 that produces the pion da @xmath14 in the limit .",
    "the basic ingredients of our analysis are _ virtual distribution amplitudes _ and _ transverse momentum dependent amplitudes _ introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section 2 with an introductory overview of the basic concepts involved .",
    "first , we remind a covariant definition of the twist-2 pion distribution amplitude .",
    "after that , we discuss its definition within the light - front formalism",
    ". then we outline the basics of the vda / tmda approach . in section 3",
    ", we discuss the quasi - distribution amplitudes .",
    "in particular , we show that qdas are completely determined by tmdas through a rather simple transformation .",
    "since the basic relations between the parton distributions are rather insensitive to complications brought by spin , in section 3 we refer to a simple scalar model . in section 4 , we discuss modifications related to quark spin and gauge nature of gluons in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in section 5",
    "we discuss the vda - based models for soft tmdas , and present our results for nonperturbative evolution of qdas obtained in these models .",
    "the large-@xmath2 limit of perturbative evolution is discussed in section 6 .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "the pion _ distribution amplitude _ ( da ) @xmath15 was originally introduced @xcite as a function @xmath16 whose @xmath17 moments @xmath18 are given by reduced matrix elements of twist-2 local operators @xmath19 as usual @xmath20 denotes the twist-2 projection of a lorentz structure , i.e. , symmetrization of indices and subtraction of traces . since matrix elements of local operators with @xmath21 diverge , one needs to supply them by a renormalization procedure denoted above by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the renormalization scale . in qcd ,",
    "the standard choice of @xmath22 is based on the dimensional regularization and the modified minimal subtraction scheme @xmath24 . as a result of such a renormalization ,",
    "the zeroth moment @xmath25 does not have @xmath23-dependence since the anomalous dimension of the axial current is zero .",
    "hence , @xmath25 for all @xmath23 is equal to the pion decay constant @xmath26 @xmath27 known experimentally , @xmath28mev .",
    "this definition of da is oriented on the use of the operator product expansion and a description of the pion in terms of the twist-2 da @xmath29 that gives the collinear distribution of the pion momentum @xmath30 among its two valence constituents .",
    "the dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath23 is governed by perturbative evolution @xcite and does not reflect the primordial ( nonperturbative ) pion s structure in the direction transverse to @xmath30 .    as is well - known , for very large @xmath23 , the pion da tends to the `` asymptotic da '' @xcite . in general , @xmath29 may differ from its asymptotic form . over the years , several forms were proposed for the pion da `` at low normalization point '' , e.g. , chernyak - zhitnitsky da @xcite , `` flat da '' @xmath31 @xcite , `` root da '' @xmath32 @xcite , etc .      a different definition @xcite is used in the light - front ( lf ) quantization framework , where the pion distribution amplitude @xmath33 is understood as the @xmath13-integral @xmath34 of the light - front wave function ( lfwf ) @xmath35 .",
    "we intentionally use here a different notation @xmath36 to emphasize the fact that @xmath35 is an object of the _ hamiltonian light - front framework _ , while the pion da @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ covdef ] ) is defined within the _ covariant lagrangian formulation _ of the quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "another difference is the use of a straightforward cut - off @xmath38 rather than a more sophisticated @xmath24-like subtraction . as a result",
    ", @xmath33 has a nonperturbative evolution with @xmath23 even if the perturbative evolution is absent .",
    "take a simple example @xmath39 .",
    "then the zeroth @xmath7-moment of @xmath40 has the -dependence , i.e. it is not constant , reaching @xmath26 in the @xmath41 limit only .    of course , if one has in mind only the applications in which nonperturbative part of the @xmath23-dependence may be ignored , then @xmath40 of the lf definition is very similar to the covariantly defined @xmath42 , and the difference between them may be treated as the use of different renormalization schemes .    as a matter of fact , in actual lf calculations",
    "one encounters lfwfs integrated to some process - dependent scale @xmath43 , i.e. the choice of the renormalization prescription and the scale @xmath43 is dictated by diagrams .",
    "moreover , if the relevant @xmath23 s are not extremely large , the simple example above shows that one may need to take into account the nonperturbative @xmath23-dependence of @xmath40 reflecting the transverse momentum behavior of the lfwf @xmath44 , i.e. , the 3-dimensional structure of the pion , which may be essential for some processes .    in particular , the photon - pion transition form factor involves i.e. lfwf @xmath44 integrated over @xmath45 till @xmath46 @xcite . as a result , the remaining @xmath7-integral in the lf formula has a finite @xmath47 limit : the infrared small-@xmath7 divergence is eliminated by a cut - off provided by @xmath48 . on the other hand ,",
    "a formula involving @xmath24-based da @xmath49 with a fixed scale @xmath23 is singular in the @xmath47 limit .",
    "one may question the applicability of the lf formula down to @xmath50 , but at least it does not give an infinite result for a quantity that is known to be finite .",
    "for this reason , the lf formula looks as a more attractive tool for modeling the form factor behavior at moderate @xmath51 than the perturbative qcd @xmath52 twist expansion .",
    "still , a problem with the lf formalism is that lfwfs are not directly connected with the usual objects of the covariant field theory , such as matrix elements of local or nonlocal operators .    in our papers @xcite ,",
    "we have developed the formalism of _ virtuality distribution amplitudes _",
    "( vdas ) that is fully based on the covariant field theory concepts . in the vda approach ,",
    "the pion is described by the _ transverse momentum dependent distribution amplitude _",
    "( tmda ) which has a direct connection with the objects of the covariant qft . on the other hand , just like the lf wave functions , the give a 3-dimensional description of the pion structure .      to omit inessential complications related to spin , we illustrate the ideas underlying tmdas using a simple example of a scalar theory .",
    "the key element of our approach @xcite is the _ vda representation _ @xmath53",
    "that basically reflects the fact that the matrix element @xmath54 depends on @xmath55 through @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it may be treated as a double fourier representation with respect to these variables .",
    "the main non - trivial feature of this representation is in its specific limits of integration over @xmath7 and @xmath58 .",
    "they hold for any contributing feynman diagram @xcite , so we assume that this property is true in general .",
    "note that starting with the first loop , the diagram contributions are non - analytic in @xmath57 due to @xmath59 factors , but the vda representation , unlike the taylor expansion in @xmath57 , is valid nevertheless .    while the vda representation is a fully covariant expression , it is convenient to use a frame in which the pion momentum @xmath30 is purely longitudinal @xmath60 .",
    "choosing some special cases of @xmath55 , one can get representations for several parton functions , all in terms of one and the same universal vda @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , choosing @xmath55 on the light front @xmath62 and with @xmath63 ( i.e. , taking @xmath64 ) gives the twist-2 distribution amplitude @xmath4 @xmath65 comparing this relation with the vda representation we have @xmath66 provided that the @xmath67 limit is finite , e.g. in the super - renormalizable @xmath68 theory . in the renormalizable @xmath69 theory ,",
    "the function @xmath70 has a @xmath71 hard part , and the integral ( [ phix0 ] ) is logarithmically divergent , reflecting the perturbative evolution of the da in such a theory . in this case , one may arrange a regularization of the @xmath58-integral characterized by some parameter @xmath23",
    ". then @xmath72 .",
    "light - cone singularities are avoided if we choose a spacelike @xmath55 , e.g. , take @xmath55 that has @xmath73 and @xmath74 components only .",
    "then we can introduce the _ transverse momentum dependent distribution amplitude _ @xmath75 as a fourier transform @xmath76 of the matrix element with respect to @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "because of the rotational invariance in @xmath74 plane , tmda depends on @xmath77 only , the fact already reflected in the notation . the tmda may be written in terms of the vda as @xmath78 the integrated tmda @xmath79 is analogous to the @xmath23-dependent pion distribution amplitude @xmath80 of the lf formalism ( but , of course , being an object of the covariant qft , @xmath81 does not coincide with it ) . in terms of the vda , @xmath82\\ ,    \\phi ( x,\\sigma ) \\",

    "the evolution equation @xmath84 follows from the definition ( [ inttmd ] ) .",
    "when the tmda @xmath85 vanishes faster than @xmath86 ( such a tmda will be called `` soft '' ) , evolution essentially stops at large @xmath23 .    in a renormalizable theory",
    ", it makes sense to treat @xmath70 as a sum of a soft part @xmath87 , generating a nonperturbative evolution of @xmath88 , and a @xmath89 hard tail . to avoid nonperturbative evolution , one may choose an @xmath24-type construction , e.g. regularize the @xmath58-integral in eq .",
    "( [ phix0 ] ) by a @xmath90 factor and then subtract @xmath91 poles .",
    "however , just like in the lf formalism , the objects that appear in actual calculations are exactly the integrated tmdas rather than their @xmath24-type sisters .",
    "in particular , the photon - pion transition form factor is given in the vda approach by the @xmath7-integral of @xmath92 $ ] taken at @xmath93 @xcite , i.e. , it involves tmda @xmath94 integrated over @xmath95 till @xmath96 . as a result",
    ", the tmda formula has a finite @xmath47 limit .",
    "furthermore , using simple models for soft tmdas one can get a very close description of experimental data by the nonperturbative evolution of the integrated tmda @xcite .    for very large @xmath23 ,",
    "the perturbative evolution dominates and eventually brings @xmath97 to its asymptotic form @xmath98 .",
    "the question , however , is what kind of shape @xmath97 has at low scales @xmath99 gev , and also how this shape changes with @xmath23 . as we have discussed , this nonperturbative @xmath23-evolution reflects the @xmath13 dependence of the soft part of the pion tmda .",
    "below , we shall see that there is another function , the pion _ quasi - distribution amplitude _",
    "@xmath100 whose is also determined by the @xmath13-dependence of the pion tmda .",
    "the quasi - distributions have been introduced recently by x. ji @xcite to facilitate a calculation of light - front functions ( pdfs , das , etc . ) on the lattice .",
    "the basic proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite is to consider equal - time bilocal operators corresponding to @xmath101 [ or , for brevity , ] . incorporating the vda representation",
    ", we have @xmath102 using again the frame in which @xmath103 , and introducing the pion quasi - distribution amplitude through @xmath104 we get a relation between qda and vda , @xmath105 it is easy to see that , for large @xmath106 , we have @xmath107 and @xmath108 tends to the integral ( [ phix0 ] ) leading to @xmath14 .",
    "this observation suggests that one may be able to extract the `` light - cone '' distribution amplitude @xmath109 from the studies of the purely `` space - like '' function @xmath100 for large @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "again , to study the @xmath106-evolution of @xmath100 it makes sense to split @xmath110 into the soft part , for which the integral over @xmath58 is finite , and the hard tail that generates perturbative evolution .",
    "the nonperturbative evolution of @xmath111 with respect to @xmath106 has the area - preserving property .",
    "namely , since @xmath112 we have @xmath113 in other words , @xmath114 for any @xmath106 has the same area normalization as @xmath115 . in this respect ,",
    "the pion qda pleasantly differs from the integrated tmda @xmath116 whose zeroth moment is @xmath23-dependent .",
    "similarly , we have the momentum sum rule @xmath117      comparing the vda representation ( [ qin3 ] ) for @xmath118 with that for the tmda @xmath94 ( [ tmdsig ] ) ( note that they are valid both for soft and hard parts ) we conclude that @xmath119 thus , the quasi - distribution amplitude @xmath120 is completely determined by the form of the tmda @xmath94 .",
    "this formula may be also obtained if one takes in the vda representation and introduces the momentum @xmath121 conjugate to @xmath122 .",
    "then @xmath123 taking @xmath124 gives eq .",

    "when @xmath128 for a fixed nonzero @xmath129 , the stripe covers the whole @xmath127 plane .",
    "moreover , for a soft tmda @xmath130 that rapidly decreases outside a region @xmath131 , only the values of @xmath132 are essential , and for large @xmath106 one may approximate the first argument of the tmda by @xmath129 .",

    "it should not be confused with the @xmath160-dependent ( and gauge - dependent ) `` underintegrated distributions '' that appear in perturbative loop calculations based on sudakov decomposition of the integration momentum @xmath161 .",

    "<S> we extend our analysis of quasi - distributions onto the pion distribution amplitude . using the formalism of parton virtuality distribution amplitudes ( vdas ) , we establish a connection between the pion transverse momentum dependent distribution amplitude ( tmda ) @xmath0 and the pion quasi - distribution amplitude ( qda ) @xmath1 . we build models for the qdas from the vda - based models for soft tmdas , and analyze the @xmath2 dependence of the resulting qdas . </S>",
    "<S> as there are many models claimed to describe the primordial shape of the pion da , we present the @xmath2-evolution patterns for models producing some popular proposals : chernyak - zhitnitsky , flat and asymptotic das . our results may be used as a guide for future studies of the pion distribution amplitude on the lattice using the quasi - distribution approach . </S>"
