    "deep chandra observations of several clusters have detected a series of x - ray cavities emanating from the central agn .",
    "if turbulence is driven by the dredging up of low entropy , enriched gas behind a buoyant agn inflated bubble ( along with the subsequent infall of higher entropy , less enriched gas ) , then the initial heating triggered by an agn outburst is due to the turbulent diffusion of entropy .",

    "<S> we present a systematic analysis of xmm - newton observations of 8 cool - core clusters of galaxies and determine the fe distribution in the intracluster medium relative to the stellar distribution in the central dominant galaxy ( cdg ) . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the fe is significantly more extended than the stellar mass in the cdg in all of the clusters in our sample , with a slight trend of increasing extent with increasing central cooling time . </S>",
    "<S> the excess fe within the central 100  kpc in these clusters can be produced by type ia supernovae from the cdg over the past 3 - 7  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> since the excess fe primarily originates from the cdg , it is a useful probe for determining the motion of the gas and the mechanical energy deposited by agn outbursts over the past @xmath0  5  gyr in the centers of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we explore two possible mechanisms for producing the greater extent of the fe relative to the stars in the cdg , including : bulk expansion of the gas and turbulent diffusion of fe . assuming the gas and fe expand together </S>",
    "<S> , we find that a total energy of @xmath1  erg  s@xmath2 must have been deposited into the central 100  kpc of these clusters to produce the presently observed fe distributions . </S>",
    "<S> since the required enrichment time for the excess fe is approximately 5  gyr in these clusters , this gives an average agn mechanical power over this time of @xmath3  erg  s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the extended fe distribution in cluster cores can also arise from turbulent diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> assuming steady - state ( i.e. , the outward mass flux of fe across a given surface is equal to the mass injection rate of fe within that surface ) we find that diffusion coefficients of @xmath4  @xmath5  s@xmath2 are required to maintain the presently observed fe profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we find that heating by both turbulent diffusion of entropy and dissipation are important heating mechanisms in cluster cores . in half of the clusters with central cooling times greater than 1  gyr , we find that heating by turbulent diffusion of entropy alone can balance radiative losses . in the remaining clusters , </S>",
    "<S> some additional heating by turbulent dissipation , with turbulent velocities of 150 - 300  km  s@xmath2 , is required to balance radiative cooling . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the average type ia supernova fraction within the central 100  kpc of these clusters is 0.53 ( roughly twice the solar value ) based on the si - to - fe mass ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a total ( type ia plus core collapse ) supernova heating rate less than 10% of the bolometric x - ray luminosity within the centers of clusters . </S>"
