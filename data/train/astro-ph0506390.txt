    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies are presenting a fascinating opportunity for discerning between our models for the origin of structure in the universe in great detail . indeed the most recent observations of the cmb from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ ) have vindicated a basic picture for the primordial perturbations which are nearly scale - invariant , gaussian and adiabatic in nature , and which are dominated by a passive and growing - mode .",
    "this represents enormous progress by instrumentalists in the thirty years since zeldovich and novikov lamented in their 1975 monologue over the observational prospects for measuring the cmb anisotropies : ` _ _ given all the difficulties , it is not clear that we will ever successfully investigate the nature of the initial perturbations using the concept of [ sakharov ] modulation [ of the acoustic peaks ] _ _ ' ( zeldovich & novikov 1975 ) .    at this time , therefore , there is an overall consistency between observations ( peiris et  al 2003 ; barger , lee & marfatia 2003 ; leach & liddle 2003 ) and the inflationary paradigm which is well - known to contain a mechanism for generating large - scale perturbations of this type ( see liddle & lyth 2000 ; dodelson 2003 ) . in the near future",
    "though , most progress in our understanding of the origin of structure is likely to come from empirical studies of the primordial perturbations where one of the known ingredients of the standard gaussian adiabatic model is relaxed to a more general form .",
    "indeed , this has been the spirit in which many authors have proceeded .",
    "in particular there has been a strong interest in measuring the shape of the primordial power spectrum , given the prospect of a factor twenty or so increase in the data to this sector of cosmology in the near future , coming from ground - based , balloon - borne and satellite experiments .",
    "model - independent methods for reconstructing the primordial power spectrum are being investigated where one only relies on the broad assumption that the overall picture of gaussian adiabatic perturbations is correct .",
    "the available data are then confronted a more general primordial power spectrum sector , and the full parameter space is integrated out in a medium size computation .",
    "many such power spectrum parametrisations exist and these include bandpowers ( wang , spergel & strauss 1999 ; bridle et  al 2003 ; hannestad 2004 ) , band - colours ( bridle et  al 2003 ) , wavelet bandpowers ( mukherjee & wang 2003a , c ) , orthogonal wavelets ( mukherjee & wang 2003b ) . the specific choices to be made such as the number and the location of the bandpowers will require a certain amount of optimisation .",
    "however , these promising methods are known to perform well on both real and simulated data without degrading too far the expected constraints on the remaining cosmological parameters ( bond et  al 2004 ; mukherjee & wang 2005 )",
    ".    one can also apply inverse methods in order to reconstruct the primordial power spectrum , since the problem at hand is akin to deconvolution .",
    "many methods have been investigated and these include semi - analytic iterative methods ( kogo et  al 2005 ) , the richardon  lucy deconvolution algorithm ( shafieloo & souradeep 2004 ) , regularised least - squares ( tegmark & zaldarriaga 2002 ; tocchini - valentini , douspis & silk 2005 ) . while these strategies may provide a reasonable glimpse of the form of the primordial power spectrum at a lower computational cost , they typically suffer a weakness that the cosmological parameters must be fixed to some representative values and are not integrated out .",
    "in addition there is usually a smoothing step involved either in the data or the deconvolved power spectrum requiring a careful treatment .",
    "there is a data compression strategy which , although it is most similar in spirit to the model - independent methods described above , corresponds to asking a a slightly different question than whether we can reconstruct or deconvolve the primordial power spectrum .",
    "although the question we refer to has been in the air and in the minds of many people for years , and is partially addressed by any cmb analysis that constrains the power - law slope of the primordial power spectrum , it is worth stating it here explicitly : _ are scale - invariant adiabatic perturbations an ingredient of our cosmology and how can we best measure any departures from scale - invariance ? _",
    "this question is important because its eventual answer will represent the next step in our attempts to model and understand the underlying mechanism responsible generating the primordial perturbations .",
    "we will demonstrate in this paper that principal component analysis is very well suited for this purpose . briefly summarised , the trick is to choose a complete orthonormal power spectrum basis which also reflects our expectation of where the departures from scale - invariance are likely to be best probed by the data , as has been repeatedly emphasised by hu and collaborators ( hu & okamoto 2004 ; kadota et  al 2005 ) .",
    "the full cosmological plus power spectrum parameter space can be integrated out in a medium to large scale computation , and theoretical predictions for the power spectrum can be easily projected on onto the same power spectrum basis to make the comparison with observations .",
    "the outline of this paper is to describe the principal component analysis formalism , providing a commentary of the relevant implementation details in  [ sec : method ] ; in  [ sec : planck ] we test the method with simulated _ planck _ data using three primordial power spectra which are respectively scale - invariant , scale - free , and broken scale - invariant ; in  [ sec : application ] we apply the method to the _ wmap _ data before concluding  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we implement and investigate the principal component analysis ( hereafter pca ) method detailed and described by hu and okamoto  ( 2004 ) ( hereafter ho04 ) which should be considered a companion paper .",
    "pca has also been applied or discussed in countless other contexts in which data volumes have already or will soon be seeing sharp increases , for instance in galaxy - galaxy power spectrum estimation methods ( hamilton and tegmark 2000 ) , reionization history reconstruction ( hu and holder 2003 ) , dark energy reconstruction ( huterer & starkman 2003 ) and most recently in the context of reconstructing the inflation potential ( kadota et  al 2005 )",
    ". it can be thought of simply as a change of parameter basis , where the rotation is determined by properties of the observed or expected signal and noise . at the same time it is also a very useful lossless data compression technique .",
    "the basic set - up in the context of the cmb is not at all unfamiliar to astrophysics , that of a deconvolution problem @xmath4 where @xmath5 and the dependence of the cmb transfer functions @xmath6 on the cosmological parameters @xmath7 has been written explicitly in order to show the added complication over and above an ordinary deconvolution problem of this type .",
    "interestingly , there is a satisfactory solution to the problem of extracting the primordial power spectrum @xmath8 , described in ho04 , which involves exploiting what we know about the expected noise on @xmath0 and our precise and accurate knowledge of the cmb transfer function physics ( seljak et  al 2003 ) . here",
    "we present the relevant equations from ho04 .",
    "the response of the @xmath0 with respect to some primordial power spectrum parameters @xmath9 can be investigated via a mode counting approach by constructing the fisher information matrix @xmath10\\ , , \\label{eqn : fisher}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has been written using a matrix notation , where @xmath11 and where @xmath12 we can take our power spectrum test function @xmath13 to be the triangle window @xmath14 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : window}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this work we have used a discretisation @xmath15 spanning a range of scales that traverses the acoustic peaks from @xmath16 .",
    "it is worth noting at this stage that this range need not include the largest scales responsible for the sachs ",
    "wolfe effect : the fisher information on these scales tends to zero , and so it proves convenient to truncate these scales in order to later on invert the fisher information matrix without numerical difficulties .",
    "the calculation of the power spectrum transfer functions @xmath17 is achieved by making minor modifications to the camb cmb anisotropies code ( lewis , challinor & lasenby 2000 ) ( based on cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) ) , rather than using a full boltzmann hierarchy code used in ho04 .",
    "camb is run at slightly higher accuracy where we have increased by a factor four both the number of source and integration @xmath18 modes , and have calculated @xmath17 at every @xmath19 , rather than the usual splining method with @xmath20 , in order to capture the high frequency information .    , given by equation ( [ eqn : fisher ] ) , for the _ planck _ satellite , which displays a band - diagonal structure with peaks in sensitivity corresponding to the temperature acoustic peaks . here the discretisation is @xmath21 .",
    "the bandwidth of the fisher matrix , @xmath22 , determines the maximum achievable resolution for the recovery of the primordial power spectrum . ]",
    "the choice of fiducial cosmological parameters is given by a baryon density @xmath23 , cold dark matter density @xmath24 , present hubble rate @xmath25 = 72 $ ] , optical depth to last scattering @xmath26 , and a curvature perturbation amplitude @xmath27 .",
    "we assume a spatially flat cosmology and ignore the effect of lensing .",
    "the latter will be important to take into account in a more thorough analysis in order avoid biasing of the recovered cosmological parameters ( hu & okamoto 2004 ; lewis 2005 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fishermatrix ] we illustrate the fisher information matrix given by equation ( [ eqn : fisher ] ) which shows a band - diagonal structure with peaks of sensitivity to the primordial power spectrum on scales corresponding to the acoustic peaks ; the sensitivity drops again on scales corresponding to the acoustic troughs , which can be remedied by information coming from the phase - shifted polarization peaks .",
    "of course the sensitivity tends to zero on large scales due to a lack of modes to observe , and on small scales due to silk damping and beam smoothing , since the @xmath0 of equation ( [ eqn : fisher ] ) is replaced by the total signal plus a gaussian white noise model adjusted for a given experiment @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the noise variance in @xmath30k - rad@xmath31 and @xmath32 is the fwhm of a gaussian beam in radians .",
    "the noise model should be considered an important input to the analysis since it determines the range of scales that will be probed ; it is an additional ingredient compared to the majority of analyses of the @xmath0 data .",
    "we use here a noise model for _ planck _ with @xmath33k - rad@xmath31 and @xmath34 , and a noise model for _ wmap _ with @xmath35k - rad@xmath31 and @xmath36 . in a realistic analysis",
    "the observed signal plus noise spectrum will be more appropriate .",
    "gives the approximate 1@xmath37 error on measurements of the primordial power spectrum using bandpowers with @xmath38 .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the position of the temperature acoustic peaks .",
    "the cosmological parameters have been fixed , so some degrading of the sensitivity is expected . ]    as usual the fisher information matrix can be inverted to obtain a covariance matrix @xmath39 whose diagonal components provide a useful estimate , the cramer  rao bound , of the expected variance of the parameters @xmath40 with @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ fig : planckpolnopoldiag ] we plot this window of sensitivity to the primordial power spectrum ( on a scale @xmath42 set by the fisher matrix bandwidth ) for the _ planck _ satellite , which can be seen to encompass the entire acoustic peak region . as noted in ho04 , outside this range of scales , and in particular on large scales",
    ", we can only hope to recover wide - band ( @xmath43 ) averages of the primordial power spectrum at high accuracy .",
    "the pca basis @xmath44 is simply a linear combination of the power spectrum spike basis @xmath9 @xmath45 where the @xmath46 are the orthonormal eigenvectors of the covariance matrix .",
    "we can then work with a set of normalised principal components @xmath47 ( hereafter the pca modes ) which will have unit variance when integrated over @xmath48 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : modes1to4 ] and [ fig : modes17to20 ] we plot examples of the pca modes with mode number from 14 and 1720 respectively , generated using the _ wmap _ noise model .",
    "the oscillations in the pca modes become increasingly rapid at scales corresponding to the acoustic peaks where sensitivity to the primordial power spectrum is greatest , that is until we hit the numerical resolution . at this point the pca modes branch into two wavepacket - like solutions travelling towards large and small scales , similar to the behaviour noted by hamilton and tegmark ( 2000 ) , although this need not worry us . note also that the pca modes are invariant under changes in the discretisation scale @xmath49 .",
    "however , we found that in order to obtain sensible estimates of the eigenvalues ( projected errors ) of the pca modes themselves , the fisher matrix should be discretised on a scale that renders it roughly diagonal , instead of band - diagonal .",
    "the pca modes can be straightforwardly integrated into the publicly available markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) package cosmomc ( lewis & bridle 2002 , february 2005 version ) in order to explore the full cosmological plus power spectrum posterior parameter space .",
    "specifically , we use the following power spectrum ansatz @xmath50 where we take @xmath51 , which should be calibrated from observations .",
    "clearly if the underlying primordial power spectrum is close to scale - invariant then equation ( [ eqn : pofkparametrisation ] ) admits a solution @xmath52 more generally equation ( [ eqn : pofkparametrisation ] ) is strongly suggestive of a general linear orthonormal model plus a noise term ( see for instance bretthorst 1988 ) . in this way we are attempting to measure the spectrum of departures from scale - invariance which we call @xmath53 and which is given by the second term in equation ( [ eqn : pofkparametrisation ] ) ; in this context the dominant scale - invariant component @xmath54 is a gaussian noise term .",
    "concerning the numerical implementation of the power spectrum equation ( [ eqn : pofkparametrisation ] ) , we simply perform a linear spline in @xmath48 over the discrete pca modes @xmath55 , which are added together before the final convolution with cmb transfer functions to obtain the @xmath56 ; outside the pca mode @xmath18-range the second term of equation ( [ eqn : pofkparametrisation ] ) is dropped .",
    "we checked that the default @xmath18-source and @xmath18-integration settings for camb modified to calculate @xmath56 at @xmath57 is accurate enough handle around the first forty modes of our current implementation ; at this stage this is more than enough since we will only attempt to perform the mcmc with a maximum of sixteen pca modes .    .",
    "the oscillations are strongest in the vicinity of the acoustic peaks where the sensitivity to the primordial power spectrum is greatest . ]    having obtained measurements of the pca mode amplitudes from the mcmc , it is then straightforward to project any power spectrum model , for instance a power - law spectrum , onto the pca modes via @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to make the comparison with observations .",

    "incidentally , the total @xmath62 represents a useful figure of merit for optimising future cmb experiments to measure the primordial power spectrum sector .",
    "other measures such as `` risk '' ( huterer & starkman 2003 ) and bayesian evidence ( see for example mackay 2003 ) could be used to provide a rationale for truncating the pca mode amplitudes even further , given a power spectrum model of interest .    in the case that the recovered pca mode amplitudes encode some complex information which can not be easily understood in the framework of power - law spectra , then it would be useful to obtain an estimate of @xmath63 in @xmath18-space in order to aid the process of modelling the power spectrum . here",
    "we use an estimator @xmath64 and for the purposes of a comparison with the input spectrum , we estimate the noise variance via @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the covariance matrix , obtained from equation ( [ eqn:1sigma ] ) , accounting for the overall uncertainty in the narrow - band determination of @xmath67 in regions of lower sensitivity on large scales , small scales , and in the temperature acoustic trough regions",

    "it seems reasonable that the number of likelihood evaluations ought not to exceed by much @xmath87 , the total number of modes upon which the the @xmath0 spectrum depends .",
    "moreover the ` fast  slow ' split between power spectrum and cosmological parameter likelihood evaluation speeds , already implemented in cosmomc , will be of increasing benefit as we attempt to measure up to perhaps thirty pca mode amplitudes in the future ( kadota et  al 2005 ) .      in fig .",

    "the method was first tested on simulated _ planck _ data using an input scale - invariant spectrum and we observed good performance in the simultaneous recovery of cosmological parameters and the principal component mode amplitudes via an mcmc exploration of the full parameter space . in the case of simulated data from an input power - law spectrum with spectral index @xmath82 , the recovery of the cosmological parameters was biased as they adjusted to provide an overall excess of large - scale to small - scale power . however , the biasing is evidenced by fluctuating cosmological parameter constraints as the number of power spectrum principal components is increased . moreover , the pca mode amplitudes were still very well recovered , showing strong evidence for a tilted primordial power spectrum and providing enough signal to noise to overrule our assumption of scale - invariance .",
    "thus pca can be used as a self - consistent means for justifying a more refined power spectrum model than the one considered here in equation ( [ eqn : pofkparametrisation ] ) .",
    "we also demonstrated that the pca method is capable of measuring departures from scale - free spectra by considering simulated data from a primordial power spectrum containing a @xmath132 gaussian bump in the acoustic peak region , and observing good recovery of both the pca mode amplitudes and the cosmological parameters .",
    "mpc@xmath3 is shown ( dashed inclined line ) as well as the first , second and third acoustic peak scales ( vertical dotted lines ) . ]",
    "mpc@xmath3 obtained from the four pca mode amplitudes displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : wmap4modes ] . ]    finally , as a proof of concept of the method we provided a first glimpse of the principal component mode amplitudes that can be obtained from the currently available cmb data from _ wmap _ , vsa , acbar , cbi and boomerang .",
    "we obtained measurements of the first four principal components corresponding to scales across the first and second acoustic peaks , finding no evidence for the breaking of scale - invariance with only a hint of a red primordial power spectrum with spectral index @xmath133 mpc@xmath3 , consistent with other studies in the literature , with a total signal to noise at not more than s / n @xmath134 .",
    "assuming that the gaussian adiabatic density perturbation scenario continues to hold as our observations of the cmb improve in the near future , then we will soon move into the regime where the information about the primordial power spectrum will completely outweigh the information about the cosmological parameters which become , from this perspective , well - understood nuisance parameters to be carefully integrated out .",
    "it seems very likely that principal component analysis , or else another very similar data compression technique , will be essential for fully exploiting the forthcoming temperature and polarization @xmath0 data .",
