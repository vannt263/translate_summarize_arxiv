    "recent experimental success @xcite in bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) at ultralow temperature in dilute trapped alkali metal and hydrogen atoms has intensified theoretical studies of the inhomogeneous , weakly interacting dilute bose gas and its condensation @xcite . at zero temperature",
    "such a system is supposed to be fully condensed and described by the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite .",
    "two most interesting phenomena in bec are the collapse for attractive interaction and the formation of coupled atomic condensate . for attractive atomic interaction @xcite , the condensate is stable for a maximum critical number of atoms . in the presence of an external source of atoms when the number increases beyond the critical number , due to interatomic attraction the radius of bec tends to zero and the central density tends to infinity .",
    "consequently , the condensate collapses emitting atoms until the number of atoms is reduced below the critical number and a stable configuration is reached .",
    "then the condensate can grow again and a series of collapses can take place , which was observed experimentally in the bec of @xmath0li with attractive interaction @xcite",
    ".    there has also been experimental realization of bec involving atoms in two different quantum states @xcite . in one experiment @xmath1rb atoms formed in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath5 states by the use of a laser served as two different species , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the total angular momentum and its projection @xcite . in another experiment",
    "a coupled bec was formed with the @xmath1rb atoms in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 states @xcite .",
    "it is possible to use the same magnetic trap to confine atoms in two quantum states and this makes these experiments technically simpler compared to a realization of bec with two different types of atoms requiring two independent trapping mechanisms .",
    "here we study theoretically the dynamics of a coupled bec composed of two quantum states 1 and 2 of an atom using the coupled time - dependent gp equation .",
    "we include an interaction term in the hamiltonian that allows for a coherent boson - number - conserving nondissipative transition of atoms from one quantum state to another .",
    "this interaction simulates the action of a laser which can been used experimentally to transform one species of atoms to another .",
    "this model exhibits rich and novel phenomenology which we study using the numerical solution of the coupled gp equation , which can generate oscillation in the number of atoms in a specific state in the presence of the interaction that transforms one spices of atoms to another . also , depending on the nature of the atomic interactions one can have three possibilities of bec : ( i ) stable condensate of both components for all repulsive interactions , ( ii ) collapse of both components for all attractive interactions , and ( iii ) a stable condensate for one component and collapse in the other .",
    "the collapse for attractive interaction(s ) in a coupled condensate is studied by introducing absorptive contact interactions responsible for a growth in the atomic numbers from external source in addition to imaginary three - body quartic interactions leading to recombination loss @xcite . in the presence of these imaginary interactions",
    "the gp equation does not conserve the overall number of atoms .",
    "if the strengths ( and signs ) of these imaginary interactions are properly chosen , one can have collapse in one or both components of the condensate .",
    "the solution of the gp equation could produce a growth of the condensate with time for atom numbers less than the critical numbers for collapse .",
    "once they increase past the critical numbers , the three - body interaction takes control and the numbers suddenly drop below the critical level by recombination loss signaling a collapse @xcite .",
    "then the absorptive term takes over and the individual numbers start to increase .",
    "this continues indefinitely showing an infinite sequence of collapses for one or both components .",
    "we motivate this study by considering two possible atomic states 1 and 2 of @xmath0li ( attractive interaction ) and of @xmath1rb ( repulsive interaction ) whenever possible . in the case of @xmath0li",
    "the interaction in state 1 is taken to be attractive which is responsible for collapse .",
    "we study the collapse with different possibilities of attraction and repulsion between atoms in states 1 and 2 of @xmath0li .",

    "the fluctuation of the number of atoms in the two states of the condensate is best studied via the quantities @xmath48 in the presence of a general absorptive interaction @xmath49 and @xmath50 the reduced number for the two components of the condensate are given by @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the quantities @xmath53 and @xmath54 carry the information about time evolution of the number of the two components .",

    "( [ fx ] ) we employ space step @xmath85 0.0001 with @xmath86 and time step @xmath87 = 0.05 . after some experimentation we find that these values of the steps give good convergence .",
    "the iteration is started with the known normalized ( harmonic oscillator ) solution of eqs .",
    "( [ e ] ) obtained with @xmath88 .",
    "the nonlinear parameters @xmath89 are increased by equal amounts over 1000 time iterations starting from zero at @xmath90 until the desired final value is reached at @xmath91 . during the iteration we keep @xmath92 and attribute a small numerical value to @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "the resulting solution is the ground state of the condensate corresponding to the specific nonlinearity and built up with this particular value of @xmath93 .",
    "then to study the dynamics we allow the system to evolve by continuing the iteration with @xmath95 and @xmath96 for positive @xmath97 , but maintaining @xmath93 and @xmath98 at the constant final values attained at @xmath91 . to study the dynamics for positive @xmath97 for attractive atomic interaction , the absorptive contact ( @xmath45 ) and the three - body interactions ( @xmath47 )",
    "are switched on at @xmath91 .",
    "this will clearly show the possible collapse of the system .",
    "first we consider the stationary solution of eqs .",
    "( [ e ] ) with @xmath58 in the repulsive case .",
    "we now choose the following two sets of of parameters before the actual calculation : @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 , @xmath102 and ( b ) @xmath103 .",
    "this will show the effect of the feedback between the two atomic states . in this case",
    "all interactions are repulsive corresponding to positive sign of all @xmath104 .",
    "although the parameters above are in dimensionless units , it is easy to associate them with a physical problem of experimental interest in the case @xmath105 .",

    "if we label state @xmath109 by 1 and @xmath110 by 2 , and consider @xmath111 , then @xmath112 corresponds to @xmath113 for @xmath105 .",
    "hence these models can simulate the actual experimental situation composed of two states of @xmath1rb .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot the wave functions @xmath114 for the two components calculated with two nonzero values of @xmath93 above . in figs .",
    "2 ( a ) and ( b ) we plot the quantities @xmath53 and @xmath54 for these models . when @xmath105 , @xmath115 . as a nonzero value of @xmath93",
    "is taken , the quantities @xmath116 oscillate with time as can be seen from figs .",
    "2 ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "when @xmath53 increases , @xmath54 decreases and this denotes a net transformation of atoms from state 2 to 1 and vice versa .",
    "these transformations lead to interesting oscillation in @xmath116 and consequently , in the actual number of atoms in the two states . for a small @xmath93",
    "these oscillations are small and as @xmath93 increases these oscillations increase in amplitude .",
    "these oscillations clearly show the continued dynamical conversion of one species of atoms to another in the otherwise stable condensate .",
    "now we study the simplest case of collapse by taking only the interaction between the atoms in state 1 to be attractive corresponding to a negative @xmath117 .",
    "all other scattering lengths @xmath78 @xmath118 and @xmath119 (= @xmath120 ) @xmath78 are taken to be positive .",
    "quite expectedly , here the first component of the condensate could experience collapse .",
    "we also consider the collapse in both components when all scattering lengths are negative .",
    "the calculation is performed in these cases with the following two sets of parameters ( a ) @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and ( b ) @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "the wave function components at @xmath91 in these cases are plotted in fig .",
    "3 .    the above parameters are in dimensionless units and one can associate them with a problem of experimental interest for @xmath105 in terms of two states of @xmath0li . in case of model ( a )",
    "above we consider the state 1 to be the ground state of @xmath0li with attractive interaction as in the actual collapse experiment with @xmath131 @xcite . as @xmath132",
    "this number is larger than the maximum number of atoms permitted in the bec of a single component @xmath0li which is about 1400 @xcite . the state 2 could be one of the excited states of @xmath0li with repulsive atomic interaction .",
    "the presence of the second component with repulsive interaction allows for the formation of a stable bec with more @xmath0li atoms in quantum state 1 than allowed in the single - component bec .",
    "we find from fig .",
    "3 that @xmath133 ( full line ) is very much centrally peaked compared to @xmath134 ( dashed line ) in this case . this corresponds to a small radius and large central density for the first component denoting an approximation to collapse . if the number @xmath135 is slightly increased beyond 2200 the first component of the condensate wave function becomes singular at the origin and could experience collapse .    in case of model ( b )",
    "we take the atomic interaction in both states of @xmath0li to be attractive corresponding to negative scattering lengths . for @xmath136 as in the actual experiment @xcite",
    ", one has @xmath137 and @xmath138 for @xmath105 .",
    "the total number of particles in this case is roughly 1460 , which is close to the critical number 1400 found in the actual experiment of collapse in @xmath0li .",
    "both wave - function components could become singular in this case as all possible interactions are attractive .",
    "the small extension of the wave - function components in space in this case as in fig .",
    "3 denote an approximation to collapse .    although the collapse of the coupled condensates could be inferred from the shape of the stationary wave functions of fig .",
    "3 ( sharply peaked centrally with small radii ) , we also study the dynamics of collapse from a time evolution of the full gp equation ( [ e ] ) in the presence of an absorption and three - body recombination , e.g. , for @xmath139 and @xmath140 as in the uncoupled case @xcite . the general nature of time evolution",
    "is independent of the actual values of @xmath45 and @xmath47 employed provided that a small value for @xmath47 and a relatively larger one for @xmath141 are chosen @xcite .",
    "first we consider model ( a ) . for a dynamic description of this problem",
    "we take for @xmath142 @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 and allow the solution of the gp equation to evolve in time using eq .",
    "( [ fx ] ) . in the presence of these absorptive interactions",
    "the total number of atoms is not a constant of motion .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath53 and @xmath54 is shown in fig .",
    "4 ( a ) . there is small oscillation in @xmath116 for @xmath146 signifying a transfer of one type of atoms to the other . for @xmath142 these oscillations",
    "are almost undetectable . because of the attractive interaction , the component 1 could experience a succession of collapse .",
    "this is manifested in the successive growth and decay of @xmath53 .",
    "the condensate corresponding to the second component controlled by the repulsive interaction keeps on growing , manifested by the continuous growth of @xmath54 with time .",
    "next we consider the time evolution of the gp equation for model ( b ) with the following absorptive parameters : @xmath147 . in this case as all interactions are attractive , both components can experience collapse . in fig 4 ( b )",
    "we plot the evolution of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the oscillation of @xmath53 and @xmath54 is clearly visible for @xmath146 . for @xmath142 ,",
    "the absorptive interactions take control and the total number of atoms start to increase .",
    "consequently , the dynamics of collapse is more visible than the oscillation in @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "both @xmath53 and @xmath54 is found to exhibit a succession of growth and decay corresponding to collapse .",
    "hence we find that one can have a dynamical collapse of one or both components of the bec in the case of a coupled condensate .",
    "to conclude , we studied the collapse in a trapped bec of atoms in states 1 and 2 using the gp equation when some of the atomic interactions are attractive .",
    "we include an interaction in the hamiltonian which allow for a spontaneous transformation of atoms from state 1 to 2 and vice versa .",
    "experimentally , this can be achieved by a laser and makes the present study richer .",
    "in case of all repulsive atomic interactions one can have a stable condensate of both components .",
    "when some of the atomic interactions are attractive one or both components of the condensate could experience collapse . the collapse could be predicted from a stationary solution of the gp equation .",
    "the time evolution of collapse is studied via the time - dependent gp equation with absorption and three - body recombination .",
    "the number of particles of the component(s ) of bec experiencing collapse alternately grows and decays with time . with the possibility of a detailed study of a coupled bec",
