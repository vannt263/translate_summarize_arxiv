    "in this paper we propose a new version of the quasi - reversibility method ( qrm ) for the inverse problem of the determination of an initial condition in a hyperbolic equation from the lateral cauchy data .",
    "we discuss applications of this inverse problem to thermoacoustic tomography , as well as to linearized coefficient inverse problems of acoustics and electromagnetics . using the carleman estimate , we prove convergence of our version of the qrm .",
    "we also present numerical results .",
    "in particular , we show that this version of the qrm enables one to image @xmath0 like functions , i.e. , narrow high peaks .",
    "let @xmath1 be a convex domain with a piecewise smooth boundary @xmath2 and @xmath3 be the diameter of @xmath4 @xmath5 let @xmath6 denote @xmath7 consider the elliptic operator @xmath8 of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 we assume that all coefficients of the operator @xmath11 belong to @xmath12 let the function @xmath13 be a solution of the hyperbolic equation in the cylinder @xmath14@xmath15 @xmath16 with initial conditions @xmath17 we consider the following    * inverse problem 1 . * let one of functions @xmath18 or @xmath19 be known and another one be unknown .",
    "determine that unknown function assuming that the following functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the unit outward normal vector at @xmath24 we call the problem of the determination of the function @xmath18 the `` @xmath25problem '' and the problem of the determination of the function @xmath26 the `` @xmath27problem '' .    in principle",
    ", in the case @xmath28 one should not assume that one of functions @xmath18 or @xmath19 is known .",
    "this is because for @xmath28 the following lipschitz stability estimate takes place ( see [ 4 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] and theorem 2.4.1 in [ 13 ] ) @xmath29 here and below @xmath30 denotes different positive constants depending only on @xmath31 and @xmath32 norms of coefficients of the operator @xmath11 .",
    "however , since numerical studies for the case of the finite domain were conducted in previous publications [ 4 ] , [ 12 ] , we are interested here in solving the inverse problem 1 in an _ unbounded _ domain , which was not done before .",
    "this leads us to the case @xmath33 namely , we want to solve an analogue of the inverse problem 1 in a quadrant , assuming that the lateral cauchy data are given only on parts of two coordinate axis .",
    "we are motivated by the publication [ 14 ] , where the lipschitz stability was proven for an analogue of inverse problem 1 for the case of either a quadrant in @xmath34 or a an octant in @xmath35 , assuming that one of initial conditions ( 1.2 ) is zero , and the second one has a finite support .",
    "we now specify conditions of our numerical study .",
    "suppose that equation ( 1.1 ) is homogeneous with @xmath36 and it is satisfied in @xmath37 consider the quadrant @xmath38 and also consider the square @xmath39@xmath40 suppose that @xmath41 then the energy estimate implies that @xmath42 denote @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 see figure @xmath47 .",
    "then by ( 1.6 )        @xmath48    hence , we focus our numerical study on    * inverse problem 2 . *",
    "let equation ( 1.1 ) be satisfied in @xmath49 with initial conditions ( 1.2 ) satisfying ( 1.4 ) .",
    "in this case @xmath50suppose that one of these initial conditions is zero .",
    "determine the second initial condition , assuming that functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 are known , where @xmath51    suppose for a moment that only the function @xmath52 is given.then one can solve the boundary value problem for equation ( 1.1 ) with @xmath53 outside of the square @xmath54 with the following initial and boundary data @xmath55 @xmath56 this gives one in a _ stable way _ the normal derivative @xmath57 on @xmath58 thus , we arrive at inverse problem 2 .",
    "it was proven in [ 14 ] that if @xmath59 and one of functions @xmath18 or @xmath19 equals zero , then the following lipschitz stability estimate is valid @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 the estimate ( 1.10 ) implies a similar estimate for the unknown initial condition [ 14 ] .",
    "the knowledge of the fact that one of initial conditions was zero was used in [ 14 ] for either odd or even extension with respect to @xmath63 of the function @xmath64 in @xmath65 depending on which of initial conditions was assumed to be unknown@xmath66 the proof of [ 14 ] is based on the carleman estimate .",
    "the method of carleman estimates was first applied in [ 11 ] to obtain the lipschitz stability for the hyperbolic problem with the lateral cauchy data , also see [ 10 ] and theorem 2.4.1 in [ 13 ] . prior to [",
    "11 ] the lipschitz stability for the hyperbolic problem with the lateral cauchy data was obtained in [ 20 ] by the method of multipliers , but only for the case when lower order terms in ( 1.1 ) are absent .",
    "the use of the carleman estimate enables one to incorporate lower order terms and also to extend to the case of hyperbolic inequalities .",
    "recently the method of [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 13 ] was extended to hyperbolic equations with the non - constant principal part , see , e.g. [ 22]-[24 ] .",
    "the method of multipliers was recently extended to the case of non - zero lower order terms in theorem 3.5 of the book [ 6 ] .",
    "the above problems were previously solved numerically in [ 4 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 12 ] and [ 15 ] .",
    "the work [ 7 ] was the first one , where the problem of thermoacoustic tomography was formulated and solved numerically as inverse problem 1 , i.e. , as the hyperbolic cauchy problem with the lateral data .",
    "the qrm for the latter problem was used in [ 4 ] .",
    "the qrm was first proposed in the book [ 19 ] for a variety of ill - posed boundary value problems .",
    "its convergence rates were established in [ 9 ] and [ 11 ] for the cases of laplace and hyperbolic equations respectively and in section 2.5 of [ 13 ] for elliptic , parabolic and hyperbolic equations . in particular , it was shown in [ 13 ] that one can work with weak @xmath67 solutions of qrm instead of strong @xmath68 solutions of the original book [ 19 ] . also , see [ 2 ] and [ 3 ] for the recent results for the qrm for the elliptic case and [ 8 ] for the application of the qrm to linearized coefficient inverse problems for parabolic equations .",
    "the main tool of works [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 11 ] and [ 13 ] is the tool of carleman estimates .",
    "there are three main differences between the current paper and the previous works on the qrm for hyperbolic equations .",
    "first , we take into account boundary conditions via including them in the tikhonov regularizing functional @xmath69 . unlike this ,",
    "boundary conditions were made zero in [ 4 ] via subtracting off a corresponding function , and they were treated via integration by parts in [ 12 ] .",
    "second , we incorporate in @xmath70 a penalizing term , which reflects our knowledge of one of initial conditions .",
    "we show numerically that without this term we can not image well maximal values of the unknown initial condition inside of narrow peaks . on the other hand ,",
    "since cancerous tumors can be modeled as narrow peaks , it is interesting to image those peaks in the application to thermoacoustic tomography considered below .",
    "these first two ideas for @xmath70 are taken from [ 15 ] . mainly because of the second difference we can not apply previously derived convergence results and thus , need to prove convergence of our new version of the qrm .",
    "in particular , we need to prove a  new lipschitz stability estimate ( theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "finally , the third difference is that while @xmath67 finite elements were used in [ 4 ] and [ 12 ] , we use finite differences now .",
    "note that while smooth slowly varying functions were reconstructed numerically in [ 4 ] and [ 12 ] , our numerical experiments reconstruct both those functions and @xmath0like functions .",
    "@xmath0like functions were also reconstructed in [ 15 ] for the inverse problem 2 . however , the numerical technique of [ 15 ] is different from one of the current paper .",
    "the method of [ 7 ] and [ 15 ] is based on the representation of the function @xmath64 via truncated fourier series and minimization of the resulting residual least squares functional .    in section 2",
    "we describe applications of inverse problems 1 and 2 . in section 3",
    "we describe the version of the qrm we use here . in section 4",
    "we prove a new lipschitz stability estimate . in section 5",
    "we prove convergence of our method , based on the result of section 4 . in section 6",
    "we describe our numerical implementation . in section 7",
    "numerical results are presented .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 8 .",
    "in this section we discuss two applications of above inverse problems      inverse problems 1 and 2 arise in thermoacoustic tomography [ 4 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 25 ] . in  this case the target is subjected to a short electromagnetic impulse .",
    "the electromagnetic energy is absorbed . as a result ,",
    "temperature is increased and the target is expanded .",
    "this causes a pressure wave , which is measured as a change in the acoustic field at the boundary of the sample . assuming that the absorption of the electromagnetic energy is spatially varying inside the sample , the resulting wave field is carrying the signature of the inhomogeneity . on the other hand ,",
    "cancerous regions absorb more than surroundings .",
    "this leads to applications in medical imaging .",
    "hence , the problem is to calculate the absorption coefficient @xmath71 of the sample using time dependent measurements at its boundary .",
    "let @xmath72 be the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath73 be the specific capacity of the medium and @xmath74 be the power of the source .",
    "usually @xmath75 and @xmath74 are known .",
    "also , assume that the speed of sound in the medium is constant and equals 1 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the pressure wave .",
    "it was shown in e.g. , [ 4 ] that @xmath76 @xmath77 suppose that we measure the function @xmath64 at the boundary of the domain @xmath78 and @xmath79 outside of @xmath80 then those measurements give us the boundary value problem for equation ( 2.1 ) outside of @xmath81 with zero initial conditions . solving this problem",
    ", we uniquely determine the normal derivative of the function @xmath64 at @xmath24 thus , we arrive at the @xmath82 problem .    a different approach to the problem of thermoacoustic tomography is currently actively developed in a number of publications . in this approach",
    "the solution of the problem ( 2.1 ) , ( 2.2 ) is presented via the poisson - kirchhoff formula , which leads to the problem of integral geometry of recovering a function via its integrals over certain spheres , whose centers run over a surface and radii vary",
    ". then uniqueness theorems are proven for this case and inversion formulas are derived , see , e , g . , [ 1 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 16 ] , and [ 17 ] . in particular , works [ 1 ] and [ 16 ] include the case of a variable speed and [ 16 ] and [ 17 ] include numerical examples .",
    "a survey of these developments can be found in [ 16 ] . also , see  1 of chapter 6 of the book [ 18 ] for an example of the ill - posedness of this integral geometry problem for the case when centers of spheres run over a plane in @xmath35 .",
    "there is also another application , in which inverse problems 1 and 2 can be considered as linearized inverse acoustic and inverse electromagnetic problems .",
    "the idea of this subsection is motivated by  1 of chapter 7 of [ 18 ] and  3 of chapter 2 of [ 21 ] .",
    "we present this application now without discussing delicate details about the validity of the linearization . in this setting the point source",
    "is running along a surface and time dependent measurements of back - reflected data are performed at the positions of the source . in [ 11 ] the newton - kantorovich method was presented for the case when the source position is fixed and the time dependent measurements are performed at a surface .",
    "let the function @xmath83 be strictly positive , @xmath84 consider the cauchy problem for the hyperbolic equation @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the source position .",
    "it is well known that in acoustics @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the speed of sound in the medium , and in some situations of the electromagnetics @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are respectively magnetic permeability and electric permittivity of the medium .",
    "we pose the following    * inverse problem 3 .",
    "* suppose that the function @xmath93 outside of the domain @xmath81 and it is unknown inside of this domain .",
    "determine this function for @xmath94 assuming that the following function @xmath95 is known @xmath96    the full inverse problem 3 is difficult to address because of its nonlinearity .",
    "hence , we consider now a linearized problem .",
    "similarly with  3 of chapter 2 of [ 21 ] , suppose that the function @xmath97 can be represented in the form @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a small parameter .",
    "hence , the term @xmath100 is a small perturbation of 1 .",
    "we assume that this perturbation is unknown , i.e. , the function @xmath101 is unknown . again , similarly with [ 21 ] , we can formally set at @xmath102 @xmath103 where functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 are independent on @xmath106 this setting was rigorously justified in  3 of chapter 2 of [ 21 ] for the case of the telegraph equation @xmath107 it was also justified in  1 of chapter 7 of [ 18]for equation ( 2.6 ) without the introduction of the parameter @xmath108 which is actually introduced here for convenience only . indeed , instead",
