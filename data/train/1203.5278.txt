    "nearly thirty years ago the first observation of a difference between the nucleon and nucleus parton distributions was reported by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) @xcite .",
    "hence such a difference is referred to as the emc effect .",
    "the emc measurement was followed by a series of experiments in the eighties which provided first information on the a - dependence of the emc effect @xcite and the a - dependence of antiquark distributions @xcite . for a review of the data collected during the first decade of studies of the nuclear parton distributions",
    "see @xcite .",
    "interest in the emc effect was revitalized by the recent high precision measurements at tjnaf for a range of the lightest nuclei @xcite . to extract the emc effect from experimental data one should account properly for the qcd dynamics of hard processes and the qed physics of equivalent photons accounting for electric charge of nucleus .",
    "the parallel development is the bnl and tjnaf experimental studies which allowed one to observe directly the short - range correlations ( src ) in nuclei and explore their structure , for a review see @xcite .",
    "when combined with other experimental measurement of hard nuclear phenomena these observations put very strong constraints on the interpretation of the origin of the emc effect which are not satisfied by many of the proposed explanations of the effect .    another challenge for the models of the emc effect based on the ideas taken from low energy nuclear physics are the data on antiquark distribution within a nucleon , nucleus .    in the review",
    "we restrict our discussion to the region @xmath12 where nuclear shadowing ( anti shadowing ) phenomena are not important .",
    "for the recent review of small @xmath5 leading twist physics and extensive list of references see @xcite .    within the leading twist approximation of qcd nuclear structure functions depend on the bjorken variable @xmath13 and @xmath8 as the direct consequence of the dominance of hard interaction with a single parton in the leading twist hard processes .",
    "description of structure functions in terms of the bjorken variable @xmath5 and @xmath8 accounts for the renormalizability of qcd and qed .",
    "account of bjorken @xmath5 i.e. the qcd dynamics removes artificial effect introduced by the em collaboration and followed by all other experimental groups who ignored parton structure of wave function of nuclear target by using non - partonic variable @xmath4 to compare nucleus and deuteron structure functions , see figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "note that account of this effect leads to certain decrease of structure function of a nucleus i.e. sign of this effect is opposite to the one claimed in @xcite .    in the case of medium and heavy nuclei an additional effect becomes important : a nucleus at rest has an electric charge @xmath14 and related coulomb field which is the zero component of electromagnetic field . under the lorentz transformation to the frame where the nucleus has a large momentum , the nucleus coulomb field is transformed into the field of equivalent photons .",
    "this phenomenon is well known as the fermi - weizsacker - williams ( fww ) approximation @xcite .",
    "equivalent photons carry a noticeable and calculable fraction of the nucleus momentum if the parameter characterizing qed phenomena @xmath15 is not too small .",
    "we evaluate this fraction which is dominated by the coherent contribution into photon distribution in a heavy nuclear target @xcite .",
    "incoherent contribution into photon component of nucleus wave function is not negligible but it produces practically the same effects in the nucleus and nucleon distributions .",
    "so corrections to the additivity of nucleon structure functions due to incoherent photon component are tiny : @xmath16 multiplied by the probability of admixture of non - nucleon degrees of freedom in the nucleus wave function .",
    "the coherent photon distribution in protons and neutrons was evaluated previously in @xcite , while in @xcite the @xmath17 evolution of incoherent photon distribution within a nucleon resulting from the @xmath8 evolution of quark , antiquark nucleon parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) has been calculated ..",
    "] however the implications of photon parton component for the momentum sum rule",
    " one of the important phenomena in the case of medium and heavy nucleus  was considered only in @xcite .",
    "discussed above experimental and theoretical observations gives us a clue to the physics relevant for superdense nuclear matter - 35 nuclear densities ( inner core of neutron stars , etc . ) really the bnl and tjnaf data show that short range nucleon correlations ( src ) in nuclei are dominated by the nucleon degrees of freedom ; lack of nuclear effects in the antiquark distribution of nuclei shows that meson fields of bound and free nucleons are close at least up to the densities characteristic for src i.e. @xmath18 35 average nuclear densities .",
    "electromagnetic radius of bound and free nucleons are close .",
    "all these observations support validity of the equation of state suggested by the text book nuclear theory and therefore consistent with the recent observation of neutron stars with the mass around two solar masses .",
    "more generally these facts indicate that transition from low scale dynamics successfully described by effective chiral qcd lagrangian ( @xmath19 ) to dynamics at higher resolution scale should be pretty intricate to be consistent with data on antiquark distribution within nucleons and nuclei .",
    "the review is organized as following . in section 2",
    "we explain why and how an account of the qcd dynamics allows us to fix dynamic variables eliminating kinematical effects introduced in the experimental studies which lead to the artificial breakdown of the nucleon additivity for the nuclear structure functions in the approximation when the nucleus is built of nucleons only .",
    "in section 3 we build and analyze standard nonrelativistic nuclear physics approach where internal nucleon motion and the c.m .",
    "motion of the nucleus are independent . within this approach a nucleus in the infinite momentum frame ( or light - cone )",
    "consists of nucleons only .",
    "we use the exact qcd baryon number and momentum sum rules to derive the formula for the nuclear pdfs which takes into account nucleon fermi motion and show that corrections to the ratio of nuclear structure functions due to this effect are small for @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "hence it will be convenient in our theoretical discussion to consider separately two kinematical regions : @xmath22 where the answer is expressed through the average deformation of the structure functions of the bound nucleon and @xmath9 where interplay of quantum fluctuations of nucleon properties with the nucleon fermi motion effects and src sets in .",
    "in section 4 we evaluate the contribution of the simplest non - nucleonic component of nuclear structure functions - the photon structure function of a nucleus , @xmath23 , calculate the fraction of the nucleus momentum carried by equivalent photons and extend the standard nuclear model to include this effect .",
    "this is feasible since coherent effects which give the dominant contribution in this calculation are model independent .    in section 5",
    "we consider interplay of two model independent effects discussed in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "em collaboration introduced artificial correction to the ratio of nuclear and nucleon structure functions by comparing structure functions at @xmath5 variable which differ from conventional bjorken variable @xmath5 required by qcd dynamics . removing",
    "this correction leads to the increase of the emc effect by about 20% for @xmath24he and a factor of two smaller for heavy nuclei ( the absolute correction is about the same for @xmath24he while the emc effect grows with a ) .",
    "at the same time the coulomb effect discussed in section 4 generates a emc like effect of comparable strength for @xmath25 but opposite sign . as a result the hadronic component of the emc effect is well described by the emc ratio for heavy nuclei but underestimated for light and medium nuclei .",
    "the remaining effect represents the genuine `` hadronic '' emc ratio which should be compared with the expectation of the fermi motion contribution .",
    "one observes that deviation from the fermi motion does not exceed 5% for @xmath26 and much smaller for smaller x , indicating that wave functions of bound and free nucleon are very close for most of the quark - gluon configurations even at the central nuclear densities .    in section [ section6 ]",
    "we summarize the recent direct observations of the short - range correlations in nuclei which indicate that probability of such correlations is large ( on the scale of 20% ) and that nucleons in the srcs are rather weakly deformed .",
    "in section [ section7 ] we discuss interrelation between src and emc effect and demonstrate that the a - dependence of the hadronic component of the emc effect is consistent with the a - dependence of the srcs .    in section [ section8 ]",
    "we summarize the most important constraints on the models of the emc effect coming from the experimental studies of hard phenomena with nuclei and explain that wide classes of the current models are not consistent at least with one of these constraints .    in section [ section9 ]",
    "we consider plausible interrelation between well established properties of hard processes off a free nucleon and dynamics of the hadronic emc effect .",
    "we explain that the observed rapid decrease of antiquark distribution within a nucleon at @xmath27 indicates the suppression of meson field of a bound nucleon participating in hard processes .",
    "we argue that this suppression leads to a significant suppression of the contribution of src in the hard processes which select certain quark - gluon configuration in an interactive nucleon.therefore fermi motion effects and hence nuclear pdfs at @xmath9 are suppressed as compared to the standard nuclear theory giving a right magnitude of the hadronic emc effect at large @xmath5 .",
    "in section 10 we discuss briefly implications of discussed in the review effects on global fits of pdfs .",
    "in section 11 we present the conclusions and implications of the emc effect related physics for different phenomena .",
    "it was proved long ago that in the limit @xmath28 , where @xmath8 is the square of four - momentum transferred by electrons to the target , @xmath29 , but fixed bjorken @xmath30 , the fraction of nucleus momentum carried by interacting parton : @xmath31 the structure functions of any target t are given by the convolution of cross section for hard probe scattering off individual patrons with parton distribution within this target : @xmath32 the bjorken scaling for the structure functions and @xmath8 evolution follow from the asymptotic freedom in qcd and is implemented within the parton model accounting for the @xmath8 evolution , the light - cone quantization of qcd and the wilson operator product expansion .",
    "normalization of the light - cone wave function ( wf ) of a target is derived based on the evaluation of the matrix elements of the exactly conserved currents between the wfs of the target in initial and final states at the zero momentum transfer ( electromagnetic current , charmed , bottom currents ) .",
    "the parton model generalized to include the @xmath8 evolution is the basis for qcd physics of hard processes , for the searches of new particles , etc .",
    "thus the appropriate variables to describe the process @xmath33 in terms of nuclear pdfs are the bjorken variable @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and @xmath8 . to simplify formulae",
    "it is convenient to rescale bjorken @xmath34 by the factor @xmath36 : @xmath37 so @xmath38 is the fraction of the total nucleus momentum carried by the interacting parton and @xmath39 . to investigate nuclear effects which can be interpreted within qcd the em collaboration introduced the ratio : @xmath40    it is important to realize that the emc ratio as defined in eq.[additive1 ] is presented in the experimental papers as a function of the variable @xmath4 @xcite ( also it was normalized to the cross section of electron  deuteron scattering rather than to the sum of the electron  proton and electron  neutron cross sections ) .",
    "such variable is convenient for experimental studies as one can compare the cross sections of the lepton - nucleus scattering for the same kinematics of the incident and final lepton .",
    "variable @xmath7 differs from the parton model variable @xmath5 and therefore within the parametrizations of structure functions in terms of @xmath7 bjorken scaling and well established universality of hard processes obtain unconventional form which is in variance with the physical intuition . in particular , the ratio @xmath41 defined similar to eq .",
    "[ additive ] is different from one in the kinematics where @xmath42 scatters off bound nucleon carrying @xmath43 fraction of nucleus momentum , i.e. off a bound nucleon at rest in the nucleus target rest frame .",
    "thus the baryon charge and momentum sum rule are violated within a model where nucleus consists of nucleons only etc .",
    "moreover nuclear pdfs presented as a function of @xmath7 can not be used directly without the additional correcting factor to predict hard phenomena in @xmath44 and @xmath45 collisions where as the consequence of the qcd factorization theorem the hard cross sections are controlled by the parton distributions over the bjorken x fraction of the colliding nucleus energy carried by the interacting parton .",
    "we will demonstrate in the next section that the use of the bjorken @xmath5 instead of @xmath7 leads to a @xmath46 enhancement of the emc effect for the lightest nuclei ( @xmath47 ) for @xmath48 and to somewhat smaller correction for heavy nuclei .",
    "we correct here mistake made in @xcite in the process of restoring bjorken scaling and qcd evolution violated in experimental studies , see also @xcite and fig.[xscale ] below . for medium and heavy nuclei a comparable contribution to the emc ratio but of opposite sign originates from another model independent effect - presence of the equivalent photon field of nuclei ( section [ section4 ] ) .",
    "in order to discuss to what extent the emc effect signals presence of new physics in the nuclear structure we need to establish expectations of the textbook nonrelativistic nuclear model in which nuclei are build only of nucleons which have the same internal structure as free nucleons",
    ". we will refer to this approximation as the standard nuclear model .",
    "( actually the standard model should be extended to include also equivalent photons as non - nucleonic degrees of freedom . this will be done in the next section . )    at the first step of our analysis the fermi motion of nucleons can be neglected .",
    "let us consider a nucleus moving with a large momentum @xmath49 and a parton which carries a fraction @xmath34 of the nucleus momentum .",
    "each nucleon carries fraction @xmath50 of the nucleus momentum since the fermi motion of the nucleons is neglected .",
    "hence this parton carries a fraction @xmath51 of the nucleon momentum . as a result",
    "we find @xmath52 where @xmath53 . in the case of deep inelastic scattering necessity to use @xmath34",
    "follows from the fundamental property of parton model that @xmath42 interacts with an individual parton .",
    "note that the exact qcd sum rules for the baryon charge and momentum conservation were derived using eq.[additive ] or by direct calculation of matrix elements of conserved currents : the baryon charge and the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "since in this approximation @xmath54 is equal zero for @xmath55 it is convenient to rescale @xmath56 so that @xmath5 is now changing between 0 and a and consider the ratio @xmath57 if there are no nuclear effects , @xmath58    in the nonrelativistic approximation to the nucleon fermi motion , the nucleus c.m .",
    "motion is separated from the inner motion of nucleons .",
    "so the light- cone wf of a nucleus , @xmath59 , can be conveniently calculated in terms of equal time wf of the nonrelativistic nuclear theory - @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath61 is nucleus momentum and @xmath62 the coordinate of the nucleus center of mass .",
    "thus the lorentz boost in this approximation is trivial ",
    "it is reduced to the transformation of the plane wave .",
    "this property allows us to use the experience of the low energy nuclear physics to evaluate some hard qcd phenomena .",
    "there exists a variety of the exact sum rules for valence quark distribution which follow from the ward identities and existence of exactly conserved currents : baryon charge , isotopic charge etc .",

    "a popular expectation in the low energy nuclear physics is that one can account for the effects of relativistic nucleon fermi motion assuming that the vertex functions in the feynman diagrams with a virtual nucleon coincide with schrodinger wfs of a nucleus .",

    "later the baryon charge sum rule has been taken into account following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "this description does not allow one to account consistently for the probability conservation i.e. to satisfy simultaneously both baryon and momentum sum rules for the hadronic part of the emc effect .",

    "the mechanism is based on two fundamental and well established properties of qcd .    _",
    "any characteristics of a composite system should fluctuate and depend on the process .",
    "_ the textbook example in qed ( the abelian gauge theory ) is the hydrogen atom where the calculation of moments of the hydrogen radius finds that @xmath276 differs from @xmath277 .",
    "an example of observed fluctuations in qcd is the significant difference between the electric and axial radii of the proton : @xmath278 .",
    "the fluctuations of strength of interaction also play a key role in the explanation of the phenomenon of high energy inelastic diffraction .",
    "one can prove that in qcd as in qed interaction of a hadron in a small size configuration with a hadron target is much weaker than in an average configuration .",
    "_ two patterns of fluctuations of interactions are well understood in qcd .",
    "_ one type of fluctuations arises as the consequence of the dependence of interaction on the spatial size of color neutral configuration .",
    "this pattern is observed in particular in the color transparency phenomenon , for the recent review see    reveals in pion - nucleus interaction in the form of color transparency phenomenon in coherent production of two jets , cf.review and corresponding references in @xcite .",
    "another pattern of fluctuations of strengths of interaction follows from the dependence of interaction on the representation of color group of @xmath279 characterizing constituents in color space .",
    "this property is well known in respect to the invariant charge as the dependence of casimir operators of color group @xmath279 on representation : the ratio of casimir operators for octet and triplet representations : @xmath280 .",
    "these fluctuations are important for hard processes which we discuss in the next subsection . in the low energy processes instant interaction",
    "is averaged out and can not reveal itself . on the contrary it follows from the qcd factorization theorem that a hard probe selects particular instantaneous quark - gluon configuration in a hadron target .",
    "another feature of qcd is that the number of constituents is decreasing with decrease of the overall size .",
    "( last property reveals itself in the @xmath5 dependences of parton distributions , in the special high energy processes , etc . )",
    "difference in the fluctuations of the wave function of a bound and free nucleon leads to the deformation of its wave function .",
    "this phenomenon is well known in atomic physics from the application of the variational principle to the hydrogen molecule , @xmath281 . at large inter proton distances",
    "the main effect is swelling of the hydrogen wfs while at small interproton distances the overall size of the hydrogen atoms is reduced @xcite .",
    "the use of the variational principle allows us to understand the qualitative trend in qcd as well  probabilities of the quark - gluon configurations within a bound nucleon for which attraction is weaker than in average , should be reduced , while probabilities of configurations for which attraction is stronger than in average should be enhanced .",
    "( this is a particular case of the application of the le chatelier s principle . )    in @xcite the expressions were derived for the reduction of the probability of the configurations in bound nucleons which interact with strength much smaller than average : @xmath282 where @xmath283 is the expectation value of the potential acting on a nucleon in the nucleus , @xmath284 is characteristic energy of excitation of the nucleon .",
    "hence for a heavy nucleus a maximal suppression is of the order 20% .",
    "the calculation of the suppression effect for the case of quark - gluon configurations for which strength of interaction is smaller but still comparable to @xmath283 requires use of a specific model , see @xcite .",
    "one can use equations of motion to derive the dependence of the suppression on the momentum of the bound nucleon @xcite . in the lowest order in @xmath285 neglecting term @xmath286 one finds @xmath287    eq.[delta ] including the binding term can be written in a compact form if one substitutes @xmath288 in eq.[delta ] by @xmath289 where @xmath290 is the four momentum of the a-1 nucleon recoil system in the process where a nucleon was removed from the nucleus . the possibility to rewrite eq.[overall ] in this form was first pointed out in @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis which demonstrated validity of the formula for the case of generic final state of the nucleus was performed in @xcite .",
    "note here that eq.[delta ] naturally satisfies the requirement that the scattering amplitude when continued to the pole where @xmath291 , should coincide with the on - shell amplitude .",
    "hence the linear dependence on off - shellness for small @xmath292 should be valid for wide range of bound nucleon deformation effects .",
    "in particular such a pattern is consistent with the measurements of the deviation of the ratio @xmath293 from the free value which was studied in the jlab experiment @xcite .",
    "the studies of the @xmath5-dependence of nucleon pdfs find a very different dependences on large @xmath5 : @xmath294 , @xmath295 and @xmath296 .",
    "this dependence indicates that hard interaction with nucleon at @xmath9 selects quark - gluon configurations in which antiquarks in the nucleon and in particular the meson field is suppressed .",
    "the suppression of the interaction of nucleons in such configurations can be demonstrated in the perturbative qcd and on the level of emission of mesons as suppression of the pion emission by a small size configurations in a nucleon ( see analysis in appendix d of @xcite ) .    at the same time",
    "the analyses of low energy nucleon - nucleon interaction suggest that the dominant contribution to the src for @xmath297 mev / c originates from the @xmath298 channel where pion exchange plays a very important role ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    combining this observation with the arguments of the previous subsection",
    "we conclude that probability of configurations with large @xmath5 partons should be suppressed in the bound nucleons with the amount of the suppression comparable to the one given by eq.[overall ] which is of correct magnitude to explain the emc effect for @xmath299 .    in the limit when one can average over the fermi motion of nucleons ( @xmath300 ) we find for the a - dependence of @xmath301 :",
    "@xmath302 hence we conclude that for the discussed kinematics the hadronic emc effect should be proportional to @xmath199 with a good accuracy which is indeed the case , see the discussion in section 6 .",
    "the critical test of the discussed picture would be a study of the dependence of the nucleon deformation on the nucleon momentum which for a large range of nucleon momenta should be proportional to the square of the momentum of the struck nucleon .",
    "the key experiment to test the discussed interpretation would be a measurement of the tagged emc effect @xcite , the process @xmath303 with detection of the recoil nucleon with light cone fraction @xmath304 . in this process",
    "one can measure the bound nucleon structure function @xmath305 .",
    "we expect that @xmath306 with @xmath307 small for @xmath308 and rapidly growing at larger @xmath128 .",
    "a fast dependence of the effect on @xmath128 would make it easier to separate it from possible final state interaction effects . ]",
    "a priori the deformation of a bound nucleon can also depend on the angle @xmath309 between the momentum of the struck nucleon and the reaction axis as @xmath310 here @xmath311 is cross section averaged over @xmath309 and @xmath312 is the phase volume and the factor @xmath313 characterizes non - spherical deformation .",
    "correlation between the photon polarization and @xmath314 direction is also possible .",
    "such non - spherical polarization is well known in atomic physics . contrary to qed",
    "detailed calculations of this effect are not possible in qcd .",
    "however , a qualitatively similar deformation of the bound nucleons should arise in qcd",
    ". one may expect that the deformation of bound nucleon should be maximal in the direction of radius vector between two nucleons of src .",
    "the @xmath309-dependent shape deformations of bound nucleons are averaged out in the emc effect for @xmath79 .",
    "as we mentioned above a non - spherical nucleon deformation may be manifested in the polarization effect in the process @xmath315 where the the measured asymmetry can be interpreted in terms of the deviation of ratio @xmath316 for a bound nucleon from the free value .",
    "it would be interesting to check whether the same pattern is observed for the scattering off the deuteron , whether the linear dependence on @xmath292 extends up to larger nucleon momenta and look for the dependence of the effect on the angle @xmath309 . since the deformation is expected to be strongest along the radius vector between the nucleons",
    ", one may expect the deviations from the free nucleon case to be maximal for @xmath317 .",
    "application of the baryon charge and momentum qcd sum rules allows us to prove that the emc effect is a genuine nuclear effect . to extract hadronic emc effect from data",
    "one should take into account the model independent effects .",
    "additivity of the nucleus structure functions follows from nuclear physics ideas if the bjorken @xmath5 is used for the scattering off nuclei as dictated by the parton model and qcd .",
    "account of qed requires to include the equivalent photon component of the light - cone wf of the heavy nucleus .",
    "comparison of nuclear and deuteron structure functions at the same variable @xmath7 leads to underestimate of the emc effect for for all nuclei . at the same time the two effects we discussed mostly",
    "compensate each other in the case of hadronic component of the emc effect for heavy nuclei .",
    "the data indicate that the hadronic emc effect is a predominantly a high @xmath5 phenomenon .",
    "the a - dependence of the hadronic emc effect is consistent with the a - dependence of the two nucleon correlations .",
    "the implementation of above mentioned effects impacts also on the nucleon pdfs extracted from the data and in particular somewhat increases the nuclear correction for extraction of @xmath318 from the deuteron data .",
    "we also emphasized that the presence of predominantly nucleonic src in nuclei together with the similar a - dependence of srcs and the hadronic emc effect , and lack of the nuclear enhancement of antiquark distribution in nuclei , put strong constraints on the mechanism of the emc effect .",
    "these data pose a serious problem for the mean field models where src are absent . at the same time they are consistent with the scenario of the nucleon deformation occurring predominantly due to suppression of small size , large @xmath319 configurations in the bound nucleons .",
    "it is based on the well established properties of bound states in qcd : presence of fluctuations with strength of the interaction and of quark - gluon content , and selection of the certain instantaneous quark - gluon configurations by hard processes .",
    "deformation of peripheral pion cloud of a nucleon is suppressed since in low energy qcd pion - pion interaction is suppressed by high power of pion momentum .",
    "it is important to perform further experimental measurements of the emc ratio for @xmath10 at large @xmath8 which will become feasible at jlab 12 .",
    "especially interesting would be to study the ratio of the emc effect in @xmath320ca and @xmath321ca since in this case the standard model leads to the same nuclear effect .",
    "moreover such research would provide a unique window on the structure of neutron rich high density nuclear matter relevant for description of the cores of the neutron stars .",
    "the critical tests of the current ideas will be possible in the processes where momentum of the struck nucleon is tagged .",
    "it is expected that effect should be proportional to the nucleon off - shellness and may also depend on the direction between the momentum of the struck nucleon and the virtual photon momentum ( polarization ) .",
    "it would also be interesting to analyze the role of the violation of the isotopic invariance due to presence of the coulomb field in nuclei and in particular the difference of the momentum fraction carried by photons in protons and neutrons ( @xmath322 ) and its role in the extraction the weinberg angle from neutrino data@xcite .",
    "we thank w.vogelsang for informing us about early studies of the effect of the coulomb field in nucleons .",
    "we are indebted to v.gribov(1993 ) and h.bethe ( 1995 ) who draw our attention to angular asymmetry of deformation of atoms in qed in the close interaction .",
