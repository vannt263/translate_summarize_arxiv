    "numerically solving the full 3d nonlinear einstein equations is , for several reasons , a daunting task .",
    "still , numerical relativity remains the best method for studying astrophysically interesting regions of the solution space of the einstein equations in sufficient detail and accuracy in order to be used to interpret measurements made by the up and coming gravitational wave detectors .",
    "even though numerical relativity is almost 35 years old , some of the same problems faced by researchers three decades ago are present today . aside from the computational complexity of implementing a numerical solver for the nonlinear einstein equations , there exist several unsolved problems , including the well - posedness of certain initial value formulations of the einstein equations and the proper choice of gauge .",
    "not the least of these problems is numerical stability .",
    "a common thread in numerical relativity research over the past three decades is the observation of high frequency ( nyquist frequency ) noise growing and dominating the numerical solution .",
    "traditionally , numerical studies have been performed with the initial value formulation of the einstein equations known as the adm 3 + 1 formulation@xcite , in which the 3-metric and extrinsic curvature are the dynamically evolved variables .    lately , a formulation based on variables in which the conformal factor of the 3-metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are factored out and evolved separately has been studied .",
    "this conformal - traceless ( ct ) formulation was first introduced by nakamura and shibata  @xcite and later slightly modified by baumgarte and shapiro  @xcite .",
    "the stability properties of the ct formulation were shown in @xcite to be better than those of the adm formulation for linear waves .",
    "the improvement in numerical stability in the ct formulation versus the adm formulation was demonstrated in strong field dynamical cases in  @xcite .",
    "a step toward understanding the improved stability properties of the ct formulation was taken in  @xcite where it was shown by analytically linearizing the adm and ct equations about flat space that the ct system effectively decouples the gauge modes and constraint violating modes .",
    "it was conjectured that giving the constraint violating modes nonzero propagation speed results in a stable evolution .    here",
    ", we take another step towards understanding the improved stability properties of the ct system by performing a von neumann stability analysis on discretizations of both the adm and ct systems .",
    "we are led to the von neumann stability analysis by lax s equivalence theorem  @xcite , which states that given a well posed initial value problem and a discretization that is consistent with that initial value problem ( i.e. , the finite difference equations are faithful to the differential equations ) , then stability is equivalent to convergence . here ,",
    "the words `` stability '' and `` convergence '' are taken to mean very specific things .",
    "convergence is taken to mean pointwise convergence of solutions of the finite difference equations to solutions of the differential equations .",
    "this is the _ pice de rsistance _ of numerical relativity .",
    "after all , what we are interested in are solutions to the differential equations .",
    "stability , on the other hand , has a rather technical definition involving the uniform boundedness of the discrete fourier transform of the finite difference update operator ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "in essence , stability is the statement that there should be a limit to the extent to which any component of an initial discrete function can be amplified during the numerical evolution procedure ( note that stability is a statement concerning the finite difference equations , _ not _ the differential equations ) .",
    "fortunately , the technical definition of stability can be shown to be equivalent to the von neumann stability condition , which will be described in detail in the next section .",
    "while one can not apply lax s equivalence theorem directly in numerical relativity ( the initial value problem well - posedness assumption is not valid for the einstein field equations in that the evolution operator is not , in general , uniformly bounded ) , numerical relativists often use it as a `` road map '' ; clearly consistency and stability are important parts of any discretization of the einstein equations ( curiously , convergence is usually implicitly assumed in most numerical studies ) .",
    "code tests , if done at all , usually center around verifying the consistency of the finite difference equations to the differential equations ( as an example of the extents to which some numerical relativists will go to check the consistency of the finite difference equations to the differential equations , see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . stability , on the other hand , is usually assessed postmortem .",
    "if the code crashes immediately after a sharp rise in nyquist frequency noise and/or if the code crashes sooner in coordinate time at higher resolutions , the code is deemed unstable .",
    "we suggest that the stability of the code can be assessed before ( and perhaps even more importantly , while ) numerical evolutions take place .",
    "as will be seen in the next section , the stability properties of any given nonlinear finite difference update operator depend not only on the courant factor @xmath2 , but also on the values of the discrete evolution variables themselves .",
    "therefore , during numerical evolutions of nonlinear problems , as the evolved variables change from discrete timestep to timestep , the stability properties of the finite difference operator change along with them ! ideally , one would want to verify that the finite difference update operator remains stable for _ each _ point in the computational domain _ at each timestep_. while the computational expense of this verification would be prohibitive , verification at a reasonably sampled subset of discrete points could be feasible .",
    "the remainder of the paper is outlined as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : vonneumann ] will describe the von neumann stability analysis for a discretization of a general set of nonlinear partial differential equations in one spatial dimension .",
    "included will be results from a von neumann stability analysis of the linear wave equation discretized with an iterative crank - nicholson scheme .",
    "section  [ sec : grflat ] will present the adm and ct formulations of the einstein equations restricted to diagonal metrics and further restricted to dependence on only one spatial variable .",
    "the von neumann stability analysis is performed on iterative crank - nicholson discretizations of both formulations with flat initial data .",
    "section  [ sec : nonlin_anal ] will repeat the von neumann stability analysis from section  [ sec : grflat ] with a nonlinear wave solution for initial data .",

    "the amplification matrix at @xmath15 is given by  @xcite @xmath16 the condition for numerical stability  @xcite is that the spectral radius of the amplification matrix @xmath17 be 1 or less for each wavenumber @xmath18 .",

    "contrast this with the nonlinear case where the amplification matrix @xmath17 is not only a function of discretization parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the mode wavenumber @xmath18 , but also of initial data @xmath21 . in this case , not only must one verify that the amplification matrix @xmath17 have a spectral radius of 1 or less for each spatial index @xmath22 ( assuming the initial data @xmath21 depends on @xmath22 , which it will in general ) , but one must carry out this verification at _ every _ time step @xmath25 , as the data @xmath26 will , in general , change with increasing @xmath25 .",

    "in fact , this is the case for all values of courant factor @xmath42 .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is an exponentially growing gauge mode in the analytic solution to the analytic equations .",

    "must be modified ( see  @xcite for details ) . in order",
    "that finite difference discretizations of equations that admit solutions that have exponentially growing modes remain stable , we must have @xmath120 to verify that the long wavelength ( @xmath121 ) phenomena observed in figures  [ fig : admhighsig ]  and  [ fig : cthighsig ] is simply due to the existence of ( long wavelength ) exponentially growing modes in the analytic solution to the analytic equations , we repeat the calculations leading to figures  [ fig : admhighsig ]  and  [ fig : cthighsig ] , but decrease the discretization parameter @xmath23 by a factor of 2 ( @xmath122 ) .",

    "cthighsig2 ] , we indeed see that the difference between the maximum modulus of the eigenvalues of the amplification matrices and 1 decreases by a factor of 2 when @xmath24 is decreased by a factor of 2 . therefore , the discretizations of both the adm and ct systems are stable for the long wavelength , exponentially growing gauge mode",
    "of course , the maximum eigenvalues for the high frequency sections of figures  [ fig : cthighsig ]  and  [ fig : cthighsig2 ] for @xmath104 do not approach 1 as @xmath123 , which signifies a true von neumann instability for @xmath104 .",
    "first , while the results presented in this paper are specific to the discretization method and initial data chosen here , one of the main points of this paper is to show that a von neumann analysis can indeed be applied directly to discretizations of the einstein equations . in the past",
    ", particular discretization methods were only analyzed with the von neumann method through simple equations , such as the linear wave equation .",
    "here we show that it is possible to carry out a von neumann analysis on discretizations of equations as complicated as the einstein equations .",
    "we would like to point out that a von neumann analysis could also be used to test and/or formulate boundary conditions .",
    "the stability of outer boundary conditions , as well as the stability of inner boundary conditions for black hole evolutions , could be tested first through a von neumann analysis instead of the traditional ( and painful ) method of coding up an implementation and looking for ( and usually finding ) numerical instabilities during the numerical evolution .    in this paper",
    ", we have shown that the stability properties , as determined by a von neumann stability analysis , of a common discretization ( a 2-iteration iterative crank - nicholson scheme ) of the adm and ct systems about flat space are similar to the stability properties of the scalar wave equation . however , as we would like to emphasize again , the stability properties of a nonlinear finite difference update operator depend on the values of the discrete evolution variables .",
    "therefore , it is not enough to study the stability of numerical relativity codes about flat space . in principle , one must verify the stability of a nonlinear finite difference update operator about every discrete state encountered during the entire discrete evolution process , as argued in section  [ sec : vonneumann ] . as a first step in this direction , we studied the stability properties of the adm and ct systems about highly nonlinear plane waves by performing a von neumann analysis for these scenarios .",
    "several interesting features presented themselves .",
    "the main difference between the stability of the adm and ct systems about the nonlinear wave solution is seen in figures  [ fig : admmedsig ]  and  [ fig : ctmedsig ] .",
    "there , we see that , for a wide range of courant factors @xmath124 and wavenumbers @xmath18 ( which includes the mode that is usually the most troublesome in numerical relativity , the nyquist frequency mode whose wavelength is @xmath53 ) , the ct system is stable ( i.e. , the amplification matrix has a spectral radius of 1 or less ) whereas the adm system is unstable ( i.e. , the amplification matrix has a spectral radius greater than 1 ) .",
    "note that the adm system , in this region of courant factor @xmath42 and wavenumber @xmath18 , has an amplification matrix whose spectral radius is approximately @xmath125 .",
    "this is a very small departure from unity .",
    "thus , instabilities arising from these modes could take a long time to develop during numerical evolutions .",
    "for example , the 2-iteration iterative crank - nicholson update operator for the scalar wave equation from section  [ sec : linearwaveeq ] has a spectral radius of @xmath125 for a courant factor @xmath126 , and this update operator can be used to evolve initial data sets many wavelengths before the nyquist frequency instability sets in .",
    "again , it must be pointed out that these results are specific to plane wave spacetimes , simplified ( diagonal ) forms of the metric , choice of gauge , choice of initial data used here , and the 2-iteration iterative crank - nicholson scheme .",
    "it remains to be seen whether or not these results are generic to other , more general discretizations of the einstein equations and for more general data , such as black hole and neutron star discrete evolutions .",
    "the one thing that is certain is that the von neumann analysis can be used as a diagnostic tool for determining the stability of discretizations of nonlinear differential equations as complicated as the einstein equations .",
