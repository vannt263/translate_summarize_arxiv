    "to set the scene , we first describe the quantum quench in a 1d bose gas as described by the lieb - liniger model @xcite .",
    "the lieb - liniger model is believed to provide an excellent description of a 1d bose gas @xcite . in the absence of external ( trapping ) one - body terms , it is integrable with an infinite number of conserved operators , @xmath40 .",
    "it s hamiltonian with the addition of a one body potential , @xmath41 , is given by @xmath42 the type of quantum quench we will study is found in preparing the gas on a ring of length @xmath43 in the ground state of a parabolic trap @xcite , i.e. @xmath44 , then at time @xmath37 , releasing the gas from the parabolic trap into a one - body cosine potential , @xmath45 , and observing the subsequent dynamics of the gas .",
    "this quench protocol is illustrated in fig .",
    "this form of the hamiltonian , an integrable model together with an integrability breaking perturbation , allows us to determine the ground and excited states of the model pre- and post - quench through a numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) designed precisely to attack such problems @xcite together with a set of routines known as abacus that allow _ numerically exact _ computation of matrix elements of operators in the lieb - liniger model @xcite . in turn , this gives us access to the post - quench dynamics of the gas .",
    "in particular we employ an nrg able to study perturbations of integrable and conformal continuum field theories .",
    "this approach , as it is an extension of a methodology known as the truncated conformal spectrum approach @xcite , has been primarily used to study perturbations of relativistic field theories @xcite , but has recently been applied to the lieb - liniger model perturbed by a one - body potential @xcite , the problem at hand .",
    "the nrg uses the eigenstates of the lieb - liniger model as a computational basis . because this basis accounts for the interactions of the bose gas particles with one another , this numerical method builds in the strong correlations present in the problem right at the start .",
    "we discuss details of this method in appendix a1 .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the time evolution of the gas after the quench . at time",
    "@xmath37 we see the density profile of the gas in the ground state of the parabolic potential .",
    "after quenching the potential to a cosine , the gas moves away from the center , oscillates a number of times before settling into the minima of the cosine .",
    "this occurs at times of the order of @xmath46 - we are able to run the simulation out to times of @xmath47 ( here @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "while we are able to compute the dynamics of such observables as the density and the momentum distribution function , the key to the work in this paper will be our ability to compute the dynamics of the ( formerly ) conserved lieb - liniger charges , @xmath21 .",
    "our numerical approach makes this extremely simple because of our use of the eigenstates of the integrable lieb - liniger model as a basis .",
    "each lieb - liniger state of an @xmath27-particle gas @xmath48 is characterized by @xmath27-rapidities , @xmath49 , which should be thought of as , more or less , the momenta of the gas s particles .",
    "these rapidities determine the action of the conserved operators on the lieb - liniger states .",
    "for example both the energy , @xmath50 and momentum , @xmath51 , operators act on @xmath48 via , @xmath52 the action of all of the higher non - trivial charges , @xmath53 , @xmath54 in the lieb - liniger model are simply higher power sums of the same rapidities : @xmath55 while the actual expression of the charges in terms of the bose field operators is complicated and unwieldy @xcite , the action of the charges on the lieb - liniger eigenstates turns out to be extremely simple",
    ". this will be crucial in facilitating our construction of effective @xmath22 s .",
    "we now turn to the core of the paper . we have shown in the previous section that we can describe the temporal dynamics of various quantities post - quench . in that section",
    "we specifically considered the density profile of the gas after release into the cosine potential .",
    "we now consider the time evolution of the lieb - liniger charges .",
    "they are of course not conserved and so their evolution will be non - trivial .",
    "we however show that one can construct linear combinations of the lieb - liniger charges whose expectation values are nearly time invariant under unitary evolution by the post - quench hamiltonian .",
    "the quality of this time invariance can be controlled by allowing more charges in the linear combination .",
    "moreover we show that these linear combinations of charge are not merely time invariant with respect to the particular initial condition created in the quench protocol , but as operators acting on the low energy hilbert space .",
    "we plot the fluctuations in time for @xmath22 as a function of @xmath15 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for a quench from a parabolic potential of strength @xmath58 to a cosine of amplitude @xmath59 .",
    "we do so using the charges as constructed at @xmath60 as discussed in appendix b as a partial demonstration that such charges work well at finite c.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we begin by first considering the time evolution of the individual lieb - liniger charges themselves .",
    "we plot this evolution for the first four lieb - liniger charges in fig . [",
    "fig : timeev ] for a gas with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in plotting the time evolution",
    "we have normalized each charge to its mean value post - quench so that all of the charges fluctuate about 1 .",
    "the mean value of the unnormalized n - th charge , given by , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the time out to which we can track the evolution , grows rapidly with n as the charge s action on a lieb - liniger eigenstate @xmath65 is a power sum of the rapidities @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : timeev ] that even after normalization , the size of the oscillations increases with @xmath68 .",
    "we now consider linear combinations of the lieb - liniger charges of the form : @xmath69 where we choose the constant @xmath70 such that the mean value of @xmath71 is about 0 and the remaining constants @xmath72@xcite such that the fluctuations in @xmath71 are minimized .",
    "we plot the time evolution for a @xmath62 gas of these effective charges in panel b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : timeev ] for three different values of @xmath15 , the number of charges in the linear combination . in panel c ) we plot the fluctuations of this charge as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "we see that these fluctuations drop exponential with @xmath15 .",
    "( on the basis of an error analysis in our numerics , we would put a numerically induced floor of @xmath73 to @xmath74 on the fluctuations in @xmath22  see end of appendix a1a . ) in the bottom part of panel c ) we do the same for a quench involving a @xmath75 gas . in order to be sure that we are not simply reconstructing the post - quench hamiltonian as some linear combination of the lieb - liniger charges , in both cases ( @xmath76 ) ,",
    "we demonstrate we can construct simultaneous multiple effective charges . in panel c )",
    "we show that the fluctuations of a second effective charge built as a linear combination of charges drawn from @xmath77 also die off exponentially .",
    "this exponential dependence in @xmath15 is possible to understand at large @xmath78 .",
    "to do so , we write the initial condition of the gas in terms of post - quench cosine eigenstates : @xmath79 . with the initial condition as above , the time dependence of the charge takes the form : @xmath80 we demonstrate in appendix b1 that each lieb - liniger charge forming @xmath22 zeroes a shell of matrix elements @xmath81 , @xmath82 , in the above sum .",
    "as @xmath15 increases , more and more of these matrix elements are zeroed out .",
    "for relatively weak cosine potentials , the total weight , @xmath83 of the @xmath84 s whose matrix elements are zeroed out is @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "we then see the weight that is not zeroed out and so can contribute to @xmath22 s temporal fluctuations goes as @xmath87 .",
    "we see from this that it becomes harder to construct quasi - stationary , @xmath22 s , as the system size , @xmath43 , is increased .",
    "this is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ flucts_vs_nq ] , where we compare @xmath22 s constructed at different @xmath88 .",
    "we see that the point where the fluctuations become exponentially small goes as @xmath89 .    for large amplitude @xmath90 cosine potentials ,",
    "the temporal fluctuations die off much more slowly with @xmath15 : @xmath91 in this latter case , essentially the number of non - zero matrix elements of @xmath92 proliferate , making a construction where it is nearly time invariant much more difficult .",
    "so far we have only demonstrated that we can construct charges @xmath22 as linear combinations of the original lieb - liniger charges , @xmath53 , whose time fluctuations can be made arbitrarily small supposing we start the system in a specific initial condition , @xmath93 .",
    "however we now demonstrate that these charges are quasi - conserved not just relative to a specific initial state , but as operators , at least when projected onto the low energy post - quench hilbert space .    to do so we compute the off - diagonal matrix elements in fig .",
    "[ off - diag - mes ] of one of the two @xmath22 s we have constructed ( the one constructed with lieb - liniger charges , @xmath94 ) relative to the basis of the low - lying energy eigenstates of the post - quench hamiltonian .",
    "these matrix elements are plotted in fig .",
    "[ off - diag - mes ] .",
    "in the rightmost panel we display the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath95 ( normalized as described previously ) to set the scale of how large these matrix elements are for the individual lieb - liniger charges . in the middle panel",
    "we then plot the matrix elements of @xmath96 .",
    "we see that most of the previous non - zero matrix elements of @xmath95 are now dramatically reduced .",
    "we quantify this disappearance in panel c ) of fig .",
    "[ off - diag - mes ] .",
    "there we present the average magnitude of the off - diagonal matrix elements as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "we present data for both effective charges considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeev ] for both values of @xmath97 .",
    "we see in all cases the size of these matrix elements drops exponentially in @xmath15 . roughly speaking ,",
    "if the average energy per particle of two distinct states , @xmath98 , is less than @xmath12 , then @xmath99 will be exponentially small .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath22 s are then nearly conserved as operators .",
    "this conclusion is supported by an analytic construction of the @xmath22 s that we present in appendix b.",
    "in this paper we have found a construction of quasi - conserved operators as linear combinations of the lieb - liniger conserved charges . in this construction ,",
    "the linear combinations are chosen to minimize the temporal fluctuations of the charge upon quenching the gas from a one - body parabolic potential to a cosine potential . despite this minimization",
    "being done for a particular quench protocol , the conservation of the charge occurs at the operator level . specifically , off - diagonal matrix elements of the charges are small .",
    "we demonstrated that both post - quench temporal fluctuations and the off - diagonal matrix elements can be made exponentially small in the number of charges , @xmath15 , in the linear combination .",
    "we have supported this construction by demonstrating an equivalent analytic construction of these charges ( appendix b ) .    in this analytic construction of effective charges",
    "we demonstrate why certain linear combinations of the original lieb - liniger charges act as effective conserved quantities at low energies .",
    "this construction works by finding linear combinations that zero out off - diagonal matrix elements at a given order in the effective charge @xmath92 written as a power series in time @xmath100 .",
    "we show in particular that a matrix element zeroed out at a given order in @xmath100 remains zero to a much higher order in general , thus providing an explanation why our construction appears so robust .",
    "we stress that this construction uses in no fashion the fact that there does exist a set of exact conserved charges at @xmath60 ( namely the occupation numbers belonging to the single particle states of a cosine potential ) . however to reassure the reader that our @xmath60 construction is not accidentally in fact constructing these occupation numbers ,",
    "we demonstrate that the charges we analytically construct at @xmath60 work at finite @xmath78 as well . in fig .",
    "6 we plot the temporal fluctuations of the effective charges as a function of @xmath15 so analytically constructed but for the @xmath75 and @xmath62 quenches described in fig .",
    "3 . while we see the temporal fluctuations of these analytical @xmath60 charges are larger than those numerically constructed at a given @xmath78 ( compare fig .",
    "3c ) , we nonetheless see that the fluctuations in the @xmath60 charges die off exponentially with @xmath15 .",
    "a similar conclusion can be seen in our study of the temporal fluctuations of @xmath22 as a function of @xmath27 and @xmath15 in fig .",
    "4 where we again have used the @xmath60 @xmath22  although here , for the @xmath101 data , one can see that the fluctuations for the analytic @xmath22 have a comparatively large floor .",
    "all together this gives us confidence that our @xmath60 construction is accurately capturing the essence of the numerical construction of @xmath22 at finite c.     we demonstrate that the effective charges constructed analytically at @xmath60 as described in detail in appendix b have suppressed temporal fluctuations for quenches with finite @xmath97.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we are able to in fact extend the analytic computation described in appendix b to the finite @xmath78 case .",
    "the primary difference between the construction of @xmath22 at @xmath60 and @xmath78 finite is the need to take into account that the density operator can connect states differing by more than one particle - hole pair .",
    "however these higher particle - hole process are suppressed in powers of @xmath102 , with @xmath78 the interaction strength .",
    "this means that we have a control parameter in our finite @xmath78 analytic computation of @xmath22 where if we ignore processes involving @xmath103particle - hole pairs , the error we make is only @xmath104 .",
    "this in part explains why our @xmath60 construction of @xmath22 still is conserved at @xmath62 .",
    "it is however somewhat surprising that our @xmath60 construction of @xmath22 works as well as it does ( as evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fluct_hc ] ) for @xmath75 .",
    "this suggests that higher particle - hole processes , at least for quenches whose dynamics are restricted to the low energy post - quench hilbert space , are unimportant .    in the introduction to this paper",
    ", we have billed these constructions as being quantum equivalents to the quantum kam theorem and its counterparts such as the nekhoreshev estimates .",
    "there are some similarities in the consequences of our constructions as well as some dissimilarities .",
    "nekhoreshev estimates tell us that the values of the classical action variables in the face of a small non - integrable perturbation change only very slowly in time , as controlled by both the size of the perturbation and the number of degrees of freedom ( see eqns .",
    "[ nek1 ] and [ nek2 ] ) .    for the quantum case",
    ", we see something analogous but with certain differences .",
    "these differences arise both because we are forming linear combinations of the originally conserved charges , and because of how in our construction we segregate portions of the quantum phase ( hilbert ) space .",
    "nekhoreshev estimates apply to the entire phase space of the weakly perturbed model ( i.e. eqn .",
    "[ nek1 ] is good for any @xmath105 ) .",
    "in contrast , in our constructions , the approximate time invariance of the charge is restricted to a portion of the low energy hilbert space as marked by the integer @xmath106 ( this low energy hilbert space is defined by states where none of the particles in the state have momenta greater than @xmath107 ) . while we can make @xmath106 as large as we want ( provided we are willing to make @xmath15 correspondingly large ) , we can not take it to be infinite .",
    "another difference between the two constructions is the role played by the strength of the integrability breaking perturbation . here",
    "the nekhoreshev estimates provide a bound on the temporal variation of the original action variable going as a fractional power ( a function of the system s degrees of freedom ) of the strength of the perturbation .",
    "we , in contrast , can construct effective charges , @xmath22 , whose temporal variation is controlled not directly by @xmath90 , but @xmath15 the number of lieb - liniger charges forming @xmath22 . to be sure if @xmath90 is large , @xmath15 will need to be correspondingly larger in order to produce the same minimum of temporal variation ( see eqn .",
    "[ stronga ] ) .",
    "we show that the fluctuations in the effective charges @xmath22 constructed from a quench from a stronger to a weaker parabolic potential , like their parabola to cosine counterparts , die out rapidly with @xmath15 .",
    "we consider two quenches of this type , one with the gas at @xmath29 and one with @xmath62 .",
    "for the @xmath29 case , we quench from a parabolic potential with strength , @xmath108 given by @xmath109 into a parabolic potential with strength @xmath110 given by @xmath111 . and for the @xmath62 case , we quench from a parabola described by @xmath112 into one given by @xmath113.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in constructing these charges the nature of the potential here is important .",
    "our potential mixes the momenta of different ( unperturbed ) eigenstates solely through the wavevector of the cosine potential .",
    "this is then considerably different than the integrability breaking considered in refs .",
    "@xcite where they considered integrability that respected no selection rules and correspondingly saw an extremely rapid crossover from quantum integrable to quantum chaoticity .",
    "however this does not mean our construction of @xmath22 does not work if the potential induces non - trivial mixing between wavevectors .",
    "to this end we considered preparing the system as normal in the ground state of a parabolic potential but then instead of releasing the gas into a cosine potential , we released it into a weaker parabola . in fig .",
    "[ fluct_ptop ] we show the fluctuations in @xmath71 as a function of the number , @xmath15 , of lieb - liniger charges used to construct @xmath22 . as with the release into the cosine potential , we are able to construct a sequence of @xmath71 whose temporal fluctuations die off rapidly with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "and although we do not show it , the off - diagonal matrix elements of these charges fall off as rapidly as their cosine counterparts in fig .",
    "[ off - diag - mes ] .",
    "we plot the values of the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath96 in the post - quench eigenbasis as derived for the @xmath75 quench discussed previously in figs .",
    "3 and 4.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    having constructed these charges , we can ask what are the consequences of their existence . that they take non - zero values on the eigenstates",
    "means that the long time dynamics of the gas post - quench is going to be constrained . in this light",
    ", we have one way to understand the `` quantum newton s cradle '' experiment presented in ref . @xcite .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , it was argued there that the post - quench dynamics of a gas were very slow to achieve equilibration and that this slowness was indicative of the underlying integrability of the lieb - liniger model .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the gas in this experiment was not integrable .",
    "the gas was confined in a one - body parabolic potential , a potential that breaks integrability @xcite .",
    "our construction of effective quasi - conserved charges in the presence of an integrability breaking one - body potential thus provides a means to understand the slow thermalization of the gas post - quench in this experiment despite the presence of integrability breaking .",
    "more generally , our construction helps explain the finding of @xcite where weak integrability breaking does not lead to immediate thermalization in finite systems .    in constructing these operators",
    ", it should be stressed that the operators we construct are local ( in the sense that they are spatial integrals over operators that are defined at a single point in space ) .",
    "this follows as the effective charges , @xmath22 , are constructed as linear combinations of the lieb - liniger charges , which are all local quantities .",
    "thus we are not constructing , in effect , projection operators corresponding to eigenstates of the post - quench gas .",
    "such projection operators are necessarily always present in a model regardless of its integrability .",
    "to demonstrate this we plot the diagonal matrix elements of the charges , @xmath22 , which are linear combinations of eight lieb - liniger charges and whose average off - diagonal matrix elements are presented in fig .",
    "[ diag - mes ] .",
    "we see that these matrix elements are all @xmath114 .    if the nearly conserved quantities are governing the long time dynamics of 1d bose gases as in ref .",
    "@xcite , a second question that must be asked is whether this influence is merely confined to a pre - thermalization plateau or whether it influences the dynamics of the gas at all times .",
    "there have been at least two constructions @xcite of quasi - conserved quantities that are thought to govern pre - thermalization plateaus .",
    "our construction is fundamentally different inasmuch as the quasi - conserved operators are such for all times .",
    "this , in particular , implies that a modified form of mazur s inequality @xcite holds .",
    "this inequality relates the long time average of a correlation function @xmath115 with the projection @xmath116 of the operators @xmath117 onto conserved charges , @xmath118 .",
    "this inequality continues to hold with quasi - conserved charges @xmath22 but with the addition of an error term that is proportional to the size of @xmath22 s off - diagonal matrix elements ( which , in our construction , can be made arbitrarily small ) , something immediately clear from the proof of mazur s inequality found in ref .",
    "this implies that @xmath22 will control the long time limit of a host experimental observables in systems with weak integrability breaking .",
    "we consider this further in the next subsection .          to understand mazur s inequality @xcite in the context of our effective charges , we adapt the argument presented in ref .",
    "@xcite establishing this inequality in the context of thermal correlation functions . to this end",

    "here we are averaging over both @xmath100 and @xmath124 in order to remove any dependence on the waiting time , @xmath124 .",
    "we have defined @xmath125 so that correlations are measured in units of @xmath120 computed in the long time limit , i.e. in the diagonal ensemble .",
    "we evaluate these correlation functions @xmath126 with respect to the initial condition of the gas in the ground state of a parabolic trap , @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath125 is non - zero only if there are correlations present in @xmath120 that survive the @xmath128 limit , i.e. @xmath129 the presence of similar long time correlations are precisely what guarantees a finite drude weight in transport in integrable systems @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate in appendix c that a lower bound can be put on @xmath125 involving our effective charge @xmath22 of the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the diagonal part of the effective charge @xmath22 .",

    "we study this lower bound at three different system sizes and three different wavevectors .",

    "the lower bound on @xmath125 is such that the correlations in this quantity are at least roughly at the @xmath135 level . to determine whether this is significant , we compute a similar lower bound for a quench where we release the gas into a flat potential ( i.e. a quench for which @xmath22 is an exact conserved quantity ) .",
    "we find values for the lower bound that are comparable to the quench into the cosine potential . for the density operator ,",
    "the lower bound for the long time correlations is considerably larger than that for the mdf , being bounded by values of up to @xmath114 .",

    "because we use the eigenstates of the lieb - liniger model absent a one - body potential , @xmath160 , as the computational basis of the nrg , the nrg gives any eigenstate in a one - body potential as a linear combination of such states : @xmath161 of the main text the time evolution post - quench of the density profile of the gas .",
    "one of the claims made in the text is that the effective charges @xmath22 that we construct have fluctuations that drop exponentially with the number , @xmath15 , of lieb - liniger charges used in building them . for this to be a meaningful statement",
    ", we need to put a lower bound on the charge fluctuations arising from numerical error .",
    "this error would arise from the dephasing errors that arise because we can only imperfectly determine the post - quench energies .",

    "we run out to times where only postquench eigenstates representing @xmath39 of the weight of the initial condition have dephased ( defined as having a phase error greater than @xmath39 of @xmath162 ) , i.e. @xmath39 of the weight of the state is dephased by @xmath39 .",
    "this might then suggest that we find a lower bound of @xmath163 on the fluctuations of the effective charges .",
    "however the off - diagonal matrix elements of the effective charges are also very small .",
    "thus any error due to dephasing will be suppressed ",
    "fluctuations in the charges are due to off - diagonal matrix elements .",

    "this is roughly the lower bound we see on the charge fluctuations .      in this appendix",
    "we provide a description of the hardcore limit ( @xmath164 ) of the lieb - liniger model defined on a ring of length @xmath43 in the presence of a cosine potential : @xmath165 the ability to do analytics in the hardcore limit will then serve as a check on our numerical results .    for @xmath166",
    "the system can be mapped onto a system of fermions with hamiltonian @xcite @xmath167 where in the dual picture we have an ultra - local interaction term of strength @xmath102 .",
    "for @xmath168 the fermions are noninteracting and the physics becomes effectively one - body @xcite .",
    "we then must only solve the following single - body schrdinger equation : @xmath169 this equation can be put in the standard form of the mathieu equation , @xmath170 if we identify @xmath171 the mathieu equation admits floquet - type solutions of the form @xmath172 where @xmath173 is a periodic function in @xmath174 of period @xmath175 ( the same periodicity of the cosine term in the mathieu equation ) .",
    "here @xmath176 , the mathieu characteristic exponent function , is a function of @xmath26 and @xmath177 .",
    "if @xmath178 is integer , the second solution is not linearly independent and a new solution must be built ( see @xcite ) . in the following we will be interested only in non - integer solutions .",
    "we are able to create linear combinations of the pairs of degenerate solutions for each triplet @xmath179 .",
    "we focus on linear combinations that are even and odd in @xmath174 : @xmath180 the final step is to construct linear combinations of these solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions .",
    "this step amounts to the quantization of the values of @xmath26 , i.e. the energy , and so @xmath178 . for @xmath27",
    "even , we need to impose _ anti - periodic _ boundary conditions on the single particle solutions @xmath181 this will still lead the eventual n - body wavefunction to be periodic and corresponds to the use of half - integer quantum numbers in constructing the solutions of the bethe ansatz equations for @xmath27 even . to satisfy these boundary conditions we choose @xmath178 to be @xmath182 it is interesting to notice that for large enough @xmath68 , the energy @xmath26 coming from the two mathieu characteristic functions corresponding to @xmath183 and @xmath184 behaves as @xmath185 , as would be expected when the kinetic energy of the state greatly exceeds its potential energy .",
    "multi - particle states are then constructed from these single particle solutions according to pauli s exclusion principle , remembering that there are two available states for each energy eigenvalue ( @xmath178 and @xmath186 ) . in comparing to the analytic solutions of the gas in the cosine potential",

    "we thus consider perturbative corrections in @xmath102 to the hardcore limit . as the @xmath102 correction to the hamiltonian",
    ", @xmath187 treats two particles at a time , we can compute the correction in energy for the two - particle case and for the n - particle case simply add the @xmath188 contributions coming from all possible particles pairs .",
    "we have shown that we can construct numerically quasi - conserved quantities formed as linear combinations of lieb - liniger charges where the quality of the conservation is controlled by the number of charges in the combination .",
    "but while we have a concrete numerical construction of these new quasi - charges , we have only minimal analytic understanding why such charges exist .",
    "is this happenstance or can we provide something more solid ?",
    "the answer is that we can , the aim of this appendix .",
    "the basic idea behind this is to show that we can systematically construct charges of the form @xmath189 that zero out low lying matrix elements that would otherwise lead them to have a non - trivial time dependence . that @xmath22 has a time - dependence at all is due to the one - body potential , @xmath41 , in the post - quench hamiltonian : @xmath190 where for us @xmath191 .",
    "we can rewrite this term in terms of the fourier components of @xmath41 and the density operator @xmath192 : @xmath193 where @xmath194 with @xmath195 .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath92 can be written as a power series in time @xmath100 via the baker - campbell - hausdorff formula : @xmath196 ; ~~~ c_{n\\geq 2 } = [ \\sum_k v_k \\hat\\rho_k , c_{n-1}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] what we now will argue is that we can systematically zero out _ all _ low energy matrix elements ( below some designated cutoff ) of the first term involving the commutator of the one - body potential with @xmath92 .",
    "this results in a charge @xmath22 which has a @xmath197 ( and higher ) time dependence on the low energy hilbert space .",
    "however this higher order dependence is only nominal .",
    "what we observe is that for a cosine one - body potential , zeroing out first - order matrix elements also zeros out a large number of matrix elements from higher order commutators that arise from one particle - hole processes . to keep things tractable in this construction",
    "we will only explicitly consider the @xmath60 limit where there are no more than one particle - hole processes .    to understand why higher orders remain zeroed out ,",
    "we first need to describe the hilbert space as spanned by the lieb - liniger eigenstates in a bit more detail .",
    "an eigenstate of the lieb - liniger model is described by @xmath27-rapidities , @xmath198 , latexmath:[\\ ] ] where in the second line we have used the orthogonality of @xmath22 and the @xmath325 s with one another . as each term in the above is non - negative , we have the inequality : @xmath330 however for this to be a meaningful inequality we must show @xmath331 is finite .",
    "to compute @xmath331 we consider the projection of @xmath120 against @xmath332 : @xmath333 where in the last line we have used the diagonality of @xmath332 and its orthogonality with the other charges , @xmath325 .",
    "thus @xmath331 equals @xmath334 by inserting a resolution of the identity between the fields and taking the action of @xmath332 on the post - quench eigenbasis to be @xmath335 the above simplifies to @xmath336 while the lower bound on @xmath125 becomes @xmath337                  m. rigol , v. dunjko , v. yurovsky , and m. olshanii , `` relaxation in a completely integrable many - body quantum system : an ab initio study of the dynamics of the highly excited states of 1d lattice hard - core bosons '' , phys .",
