    "during the last decade considerable progress in our understanding of the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) in halos of late - type spiral galaxies has been achieved .",
    "the occurrence of dig outside of classical regions is firmly believed to be correlated with the star formation activity in the galaxy disk .",
    "the fractional contribution of dig to the total h@xmath0 emission in galaxies reaches typically values of @xmath1 25 - 50% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dig is thus an important constituent of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "recent studies with a larger sample of galaxies from the singg survey revealed even slightly higher fractions of @xmath2 @xcite .    in the theoretical picture the gas , most likely driven by collective supernovae , is expelled into the halos of the galaxies .",
    "@xcite developed a theoretical model in which the hot gas is transported from the star forming regions in the disk via _ chimneys _ into the halo , provided the superbubbles created from sne fulfill the breakout criterion .",
    "depending on the strength of the gravitational potential the gas may fall back onto the galactic disk , which is described as the _ galactic fountain _ scenario @xcite .",
    "starburst driven mass loss , at least for dwarf galaxies with shallower potential wells , can be an effective process , as the gas can escape more easily in these systems @xcite .",
    "several ground - based narrowband imaging investigations have been undertaken during the past fifteen years with a boost of investigations occuring in the last decade , to study the morphology of dig in halos of non - starburst _ quiescent _ spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "not all of the studied galaxies revealed extraplanar dig ( edig ) , but it was shown that extraplanar dig is a relatively common feature among actively star forming galaxies , and about 41% of a survey of 74 galaxies have edig detections .",
    "the most active ones were found to possess a bright gaseous halo @xcite .",
    "correlations of edig with other constituents of the ism exist , such as radio - continuum halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hot ionized medium ( i.e. halos ) , traced by x - ray observations @xcite , and dust filaments in the disk - halo interface @xcite .",
    "starburst galaxies and low luminosity seyfert galaxies have been investigated as well with regard to the diffuse emission @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "in general , the spiral galaxies with very high sfr per unit area show a pervasive dig layer ( i.e. a halo ) with a typical vertical extent of @xmath3 2kpc .",
    "individual filaments , occasionally reaching distances of up to 6kpc , are superimposed in a few cases as well @xcite . as there is a variety of morphological features generally discernible even with low spatial resolution ground - based studies ( e.g.,filaments , plumes , bubbles , shells ) , clearly the need for a more magnified view onto the individual sf regions and dig filaments in edge - on spirals",
    "is needed to study the small scale structure and to identify the connection points between the filaments and their origin within the sf regions in the midplane .",
    "only very few previous high spatial resolution investigations were targeted to address these questions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a more thorough overview on the dig topic in general and on phenomena related to these star formation driven gaseous outflows we refer to the older , but still quite relevant , review articles by @xcite and also to the more recent review on galactic winds by @xcite .",

    "the small edge - on galaxy sample presented here is a sub - sample of four galaxies from our previous h@xmath0 survey @xcite .",
    "the basic properties of these galaxies are listed in table  [ t : obs ] .",
    "the galaxies were selected to be observed with _",
    "hst_/acs , because they have very different levels of energy input into their disk ism ( expressed as @xmath4 and listed with other properties in table  [ t : prop ] ) .",
    "all four targets have edig detections @xcite , but ground - based imagery suggests different halo morphologies that can be further studied at the highest possible resolution only by means of _",
    "hst_/acs h@xmath0 imagery .",
    "galaxies with different energy input rates were chosen to study a possible dependence of the halo morphology on the level of star formation in the underlying disks . naively , one might expect galaxies with energy input levels near the threshold for the creation of halos ( see figure  [ f : dddhst ] ) to exhibit only individual , possibly filamentary extraplanar structures . on the other hand , galaxies with widespread",
    ", high - level star formation are expected to have a multitude of filaments , if they are associated with individual sites of star formation in the underlying disks .",
    "we avoided galaxies with prominent dust lanes and those at low galactic latitudes so as to have low foreground opacities for studies of the optical emission line gas .",
    "we note here that two galaxies in the present sub - sample , ngc4634 and ngc5775 , have close interaction partners ( within two holmberg radii ) , while the remaining two , ngc4700 and ngc7090 , do nt .",
    "the observations of the four actively star forming spirals were carried out between june 23 and august 21 2005 with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) onboard _ hst _",
    "( go#10416 ; pi : j.  rossa ) .",
    "all observations were carried out using the wide field channel ( wfc ) , which yields a @xmath5 field of view .",
    "this is achieved by employing two site 2048@xmath64096 pixel ccds with a pixel scale of 005 per pixel . for more details",
    "we refer to the acs instrument handbook @xcite .",
    "the narrowband observations using the f658n filter were acquired in three _ hst _ orbits for each galaxy , and the broadband images ( to be used for continuum subtraction and to study the dust morphology in the galaxies ) were obtained with the f625w filter in one _ hst _ orbit each . in total , 16 _ hst _ orbits were allocated to obtain deep continuum subtracted h@xmath0 images of the four target galaxies .",
    "the observational details , including observation dates , integration times , and filter characteristics , are listed in table  [ t : exp ] .",
    "the individual exposures were taken in dither mode , to allow for good cosmic ray removal and to fill in the ccd gaps .",
    "we have used a different dither pattern for the broadband and narrowband observations . for the narrowband ( f658n ) observations",
    "we have used a 3-point dither pattern with a 4-point sub - pattern , spread over three _ hst _",
    "orbits for each galaxy .",
    "the broadband ( f625w ) observations were obtained in a 2-point dither with a 2-point sub - pattern .",
    "the first pattern in each configuration applies a jump over the ccd gaps , and the secondary pattern is applied to allow for good cosmic ray and hot pixel removal .",
    "the _ hst_/acs data were calibrated using the _ calacs _ and _ multidrizzle _ packages .",
    "the former removes the various instrumental signatures , including bias correction and flat - fielding .",
    "the latter is used to correct for the geometric distortion of the acs camera and also performs cosmic ray rejection and finally combines the images , obtained in the specific dither pattern . for further details",
    "we refer to the acs data handbook @xcite and to @xcite for a description of multidrizzle .",
    "there are a few detector artifacts visible at very low intensities . among them",
    "are some faint stripes along ccd columns visible across the images .",
    "these are charge transfer trails of hot pixels , cosmic rays , and other sources .",
    "however , these cte losses are well defined features , which are located at a constant position , and whose pattern is repeated with a constant distance and position angle . on very faint levels , when viewing the entire frame in low resolution on a computer screen , effects of cross talk are discovered .",
    "they have their origin in the four ccd quadrants corresponding to the four amplifiers of the detector array .",
    "the features though look somewhat different from the usual cross talk features seen in @xcite .",
    "the features in our images are not inverted in intensity and thus can easily be mistaken for faint diffuse emission .",
    "however , the distance and position angle of this feature in the continuum subtracted h@xmath0 image of ngc4634 mimics the shape of the galaxy at a very faint level , and its endpoint coincides with the one end of the galaxy , at a position that has an offset and inverted position . as an almost identical feature was detected in the image of ngc5775 as well , which looked very reminiscent , we conclude , that this is indeed related to the detector , and not a real feature of the diffuse emission . at higher contrast",
    "the structure resolves and is barely visible at all .",
    "the broadband ( f625w ) images of our target galaxies were obtained for two purposes .",
    "the primary aim was to subtract the continuum from the on - band ( f658n ) images , which contain some continuum flux .",
    "secondly , they allow a detailed comparison of extraplanar dust features with the dig morphology , which are best seen in unsharp - masked versions of the broadband images .",
    "these two physically distinct ism phases ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be studied in detail to search for possible correlations between the two extraplanar ism constituents on small scales . to enhance the contrast between the dust structures and the background light from the galaxy more easily ,",
    "we have constructed unsharp - masked versions of our broadband f625w ( sdss @xmath7 ) images .",
    "these were obtained by dividing the f625w images by a smoothed version of the same images .",
    "the latter ones were created by using a gaussian filtering technique with a kernel size adopted to account for the difference in distance among the sample galaxies .      in order to calibrate the narrowband images the broadband and narrowband images",
    "were first aligned by measuring the positions of stars in the field of view .",
    "after alignment the shifted broadband images were checked by blinking them on a computer screen against the narrowband images . in order to obtain a continuum - free h@xmath0 image , we scaled and subtracted each combined broadband f625w image from the respective narrowband f658n image .",
    "this was done in a similar fashion as it was applied in our previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the use of individual foreground stars instead proved difficult , as there were only limited suitable stars in the given aperture visible .",
    "more importantly , they also showed too much color variation so that the scaling factor could not be determined very accurately .",
    "therefore , we chose selected reference regions within the galaxy that were not affected by emission . for this purpose",
    "we closely compared the f625w and f658n images to determine suitable regions within the disk , and also relied on previous ground - based images .",
    "several of the continuum subtracted images show black - white point source pairs which are due to slight imperfections in alignment and differences in the psf .",
    "however , they do not affect our discussion and understanding of the extended emission . due to the given fwhm of the used narrowband filter",
    ", it should be noted that emission from the adjacent [ ] doublet is included in the f658n filter passband . for simplicity , however , we refer for the remainder of the paper to an h@xmath0 image , whenever we speak of a continuum subtracted f658n filter image .",
    "in this section we describe in detail the morphology of the four edge - on spirals as revealed from both the broadband and narrowband images .",
    "specifically , we describe the dig morphology visible in the emission line images",
    ". we also comment on the dust features visible in the broadband images and on a newly detected dwarf irregular galaxy in the halo of ngc4634 .    the layout of the images is as follows . in ",

    "this was already stated earlier @xcite , based on groundbased observations .      with our high spatial resolution _",
    "hst_/acs observations , we are able to re - investigate the extraplanar blob , detected by us in the halo of ngc4634 , which was named patch1 @xcite . we had concluded from our previous ground - based observations that this patch may either be an extraplanar sf region or a dwarf galaxy in the halo of ngc4634 , given that the fwhm of the used filter excluded the possibility of a foreground or background object .",
    "hst_/acs broadband and narrowband observations",
    "now clearly indicate that this patch is a galaxy .",
    "the narrowband f658n observations reveal a complex system composed of several knots associated with gas , reminiscent of a dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxy ( see figure  [ f : dirr ] ) .",
    "the broadband image reveals several individual star associations that are resolved in this dirr galaxy , and the major morphology looks reminiscent of a satellite merger galaxy , showing hints of tidal streams owing to the gravitational attraction from ngc4634 .",
    "given the peculiar morphology , this dirr galaxy is possibly already in the early process of producing a minor merger with its parent galaxy ( ngc4634 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the broadband image shows a very thick stellar disk of ngc4634 , unlike any of the other studied edge - on galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with scenarios in which disk thickening is the result of a previous interaction , possibly previous minor mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "augmented longslit spectra ( r .- j .",
    "dettmar et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) seem to strengthen this interpretation of patch1 being a dirr galaxy , which is deficient in [ ] and [ ] , based on emission line diagnostics . henceforth , we label this galaxy as @xmath14 + 141751.83 , which refers to the coordinates of the brightest h@xmath0 emission region in its central part . we will report on the physical properties and stellar populations of this interesting dirr galaxy in detail in a future paper .",
    "hst_/acs data presented above were obtained as part of a multi - wavelength observing campaign .",
    "for the galaxies presented here we have other , independent measurements of various phases of the ism in their halos published by us previously , including x - ray data ( * ? ? ? * ehle et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) and radio - continuum data @xcite .",
    "a correlation study of the acs data with other tracers of extraplanar gas in this sample galaxies will be presented separately , as some of the observations are still pending .",
    "over roughly the past decade and a half evidence has been mounting that extended gaseous halos around late - type spiral galaxies are formed as a consequence of the star formation activity in the underlying disks . a high iras @xmath8 integral flux ratio @xmath15 , which is a measure of a high mean dust temperature in galaxies ,",
    "was identified as a very reliable indicator of massive star formation @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , emission features in gaseous halos are expected to be closely tied to the energy input rate , which is required to exceed a threshold to drive outflows perpendicular to the disk plane in the first place .",
    "this was first addressed by @xcite for radio data and later derived from optical narrowband imagery @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that there is a correlation of the existence of galaxy halos ( detected in radio continuum and h@xmath0 observations ) not only with the global energy injection rate , but also with the _ local _ energy input level in a galaxy and , in addition , with its mass density .",
    "we will investigate in the following whether the edig properties of the galaxies in the present sample can be explained in this context .",
    "the two galaxies with filamentary edig structures are ngc4700 and ngc7090 .",
    "as tabulated in table  [ t : prop ] , these are the two galaxies at the lower end of the energy input range ( @xmath16 ) . on the other hand , ngc4634 and",
    "ngc5775 display only unresolved extraplanar h@xmath0 emission .",
    "these two galaxies have higher energy input rates from massive star formation in their disks .",
    "accordingly , one might expect them to have a larger number of individual sites of star formation and thus also a larger amount of associated halo emission .",
    "one might naively expect this difference to be an observational artifact , based on the assumption that physically larger and more massive galaxies just have more of everything . more star formation regions lead to more filaments emanating from the disks , potentially leading to a quasi - diffuse edig structure caused by the superposition of many individual filaments . however , there are no indications of filaments being detected in the more massive galaxies of the present sample ( ngc4634 and ngc5775 ) and also other galaxies studied previously , in areas where the spatial density of star - forming regions decreases , e.g. , near the radial edges of their disks .",
    "the difference in edig morphologies is equally unlikely to be caused by a distance bias , because ngc4700 ( with a filamentary edig ) and ngc5775 ( with a diffuse edig ) are at roughly equal distances ( see table  [ t : obs ] ) .",
    "again , this makes it unlikely that the diffuse edig is the result of an unresolved superposition of many filaments .    a first indication at what might cause this difference can be gleaned by studying various properties of the sample galaxies .",
    "ngc4634 and ngc5775 are the two galaxies with diffuse edig , one of them is also the most massive galaxy in the present sample ( see table  [ t : prop ] ) . from the width of the emission line",
    "we derive an estimated total mass for ngc5775 of about @xmath17 .",
    "interestingly though , in contrast , the mass of ngc4634 is almost a factor of two below that of ngc7090 .",
    "so this complicates the interpretation that the mass alone is a sensitive indicator for the morphology of edig .",
    "the general trend and the earlier work by @xcite indicate that the mass ( or mass density ) of a galaxy is an important control parameter for the morphology of the edig .",
    "low mass galaxies such as the dwarf ngc55 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ngc2188 @xcite and the blue compact dwarf galaxy izw18 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show filamentary structure , whereas the more massive galaxies ( with widespread star formation , not the powerful nucleated starbursts ; e.g. , ngc891 @xcite ) tend to have relatively smooth layers of edig .",
    "an explanation for this could be the fact that the gas can overcome the gravitational potential wells of the galaxies more easily .",
    "the range of masses spanned by our sample is rather small ( see table  [ t : prop ] ) , so it may not be surprising that any trends with mass are less clear in our sample than those observed in samples that contains both dwarf and giant galaxies .    of our targets only ngc7090 and , to a lesser degree , ngc4700 ,",
    "contain bubbles , shells or supershells . in ngc7090 a large number of such features , of various sizes , are found . also , the sf regions in this galaxy are loosely scattered within the disk , and the major outflows are confined to only one side above the disk ( see descriptions of the edig morphology in the individual regions within each galaxy listed in table  [ t : morph ] ) .    among our studied sample ,",
    "the resolved small - scale dig halo morphology is showing a clear dependence on the star formation rate per unit area @xmath18 .",
    "that is , galaxies with @xmath19 ( in units of @xmath20 ) , show a smooth , diffuse dig halo , as opposed to the galaxies with values @xmath21 , which show primarily filamentary dig .",
    "the studied galaxies thus can be arranged into a _ sequence _ of edig diffuseness as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "more generally speaking , there is a morphological dig sequence among sf galaxies observed evolving from galaxies which reveal mostly bubbles and supershells to galaxies which show filamentary emission and to cases which have smooth edig layers ( i.e. halos ) . where there are bubbles ( i.e. enclosed structures ) the breakout condition can not have been met yet .",
    "although it has been established that edig originates from the sf regions within the disk , the galactic environment in which the individual galaxies reside , is of course of importance , too .",
    "it may , e.g. , contribute to the extent of the emission that is detected .",
    "of the four galaxies studied here , two ( ngc4634 and ngc5775 ) have nearby companion galaxies ( i.e. they form galaxy pairs ) . ngc4700 and ngc7090 , in contrast ,",
    "are rather isolated spirals .",
    "our current sample is not large enough to draw any statistical conclusions .",
    "but since one galaxy from each category has a filamentary and the other a diffuse edig morphology , the presence of a nearby companion does not appear to dominate the edig properties in these cases .",
    "however , significant exceptions may be expected in dense group environments , where galaxies experience effects such as ram pressure stripping ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to ask whether or not there seems to be a more global connection between the various ism constituents that are responsible for driving a kiloparsec outflow or wind .",
    "obviously , there is a connection linking the various ism phases as described for modest galaxy samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the details are far from being well understood .    from the sample of @xcite , it was concluded that the presence of a diffuse ionized gas halo was always accompanied by a grand scale x - ray halo , which generally revealed that the hot tenuous gas is far more extended than the dig . in those cases also a cosmic ray halo , traced by radio - continuum observations , was discovered . linking the cosmic - ray halo to the dig halo , showed clear evidence that the mass surface density was a good proxy for the presence of a gaseous halo .",
    "the mass of the stellar disk ( @xmath22 ) , derived from k - band observations , is divided by the area of the optical disk ( @xmath23 ) , which yields the mass surface density .",
    "for ngc4700 a value of @xmath24 was determined @xcite . despite having higher values than the more quiescent galaxies",
    ", this is a rather modest number compared to local starburst galaxies which can have mass surface densities of up to eight times as high .",
    "however , does the mass density critically control whether a galaxy has a kiloparsec outflow or rather a more filament - driven dig morphology ?",
    "our present sample is certainly too small to answer this question unambiguously , as two galaxies each fall into the category of either having a filamentary dig morphology , or showing a more smooth dig layer .",
    "one of the greatest challenges any theoretical concept poses is how accurately it can reflect or predict the observational details . in terms of the chimney model @xcite , past observations from different wavebands , both in galactic and extragalactic studies , have failed to reveal many of these structures that were predicted .",
    "more specifically , the number of predicted chimneys is of the order of several hundred in a galaxy of modest sf activity . yet",
    ", only very few chimneys have been detected , if any at all .",
    "so the prediction falls short by at least two orders of magnitudes .",
    "previous reports include a galactic chimney in the perseus arm @xcite and the galactic chimney gsh@xmath25 @xcite as well as evidence for a chimney breakout in the galactic supershell gsh@xmath26 @xcite .",
    "extragalactic chimneys or structures identified as such so far have been observed only in the starburst galaxy m82 @xcite .",
    "but we have to carefully consider whether this is due to an observational bias or attributed to certain physical contraints .",
    "previously , ngc891 was imaged in h@xmath0 @xcite , where no evidence was found for the chimney mode . however , the situation in ngc891 is complicated by the fact that it has a very prominent dust layer , which possibly could have obscured any chimney structures ( i.e. chimney walls ) in the lower disk - halo interface ( @xmath27pc ) .",
    "therefore , those structures could have gone undetected even if they existed .",
    "our currently studied galaxies by and large have a much less dusty galactic midplane , so the effects of dust obscuration should be considerably mitigated .",
    "however , from our imaging studies it is obvious that there are no clear indications for the chimney mode in these actively star forming galaxies . in ngc4634 and ngc5775",
    "there are no such structures observed in h@xmath0 .",
    "are there indications of other related phenomena ?",
    "evidently , there are several features ( e.g. , curved filaments ) visible whose morphology show an almost closed loop , indicative of the galactic fountain scenario . however , without detailed knowledge of the kinematics ( e.g.,mapping of the velocity field ) we can not say what parts of the looped filament are still moving upward and what parts possibly are already descending . furthermore , multiple episodes of sf driven outflows may have altered the geometry of the outflows along the line of sight . hence the chimney structures may look like sheets , or picked up more complex structures generated by overlapping filaments .",
    "nonetheless , it seems obvious that these features are associated with an sf driven outflow .",
    "recent models by @xcite simulated the star formation in galactic disks involving feedback by sne .",
    "the density , temperature , and pressure maps ( see their figure  6 ) show copious amounts of warm and hot gas being driven into the halo regions , extending out to a few kiloparsecs .",
    "in particular , those simulations look very reminiscent to the morphology seen in our h@xmath0 image of ngc4700 on a global scale .",
    "more recent models of a galactic wind as seen in starburst galaxies @xcite replicate very detailed structures including the filamentary morphology seen as for instance in m82 . while considerable progress has been achieved in modeling even small scale structures in a magnetized ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more refined simulations are necessary in order to compare them to the high spatial resolution multi - structured edig observations , as those presented in this study .",
    "we have observed four edge - on spiral galaxies with different levels of star formation in h@xmath0 with the _ hst_/acs to study the morphology of their extraplanar dig ( edig ) .",
    "the distribution of the edig is very different among the sample galaxies . while the edig is very filamentary in ngc4700 and in ngc7090 , the distribution of the edig in ngc4634 and ngc5775 is remarkably smooth .",
    "the latter two galaxies have the highest sf rate per unit area in our sample and ngc5775 is also the most massive galaxy in the sample .    based on our current and earlier results , we conclude that the observed differences are probably a consequence of their different levels of sf activity _ and _ their total masses and/or mass densities .",
    "whereas the sf rate per unit area controls the presence ( e.g. , the radial extent ) , shape and amount of edig in a galaxy s halo , the total mass or mass density seems to be at least in part responsible for the actual shape of the edig .",
    "this is corroborated by a comparison of the morphology of the lower - mass galaxies to those of sf dwarf galaxies such as ngc55 or the blue compact dwarf izw18 .",
    "the more massive galaxies with active sf seem to expell their gaseous outflows more globally and diffusively .",
    "the studied galaxies can be arranged into a _ sequence _ of edig diffuseness as a function of star formation activity per unit area .",
    "more generally speaking , there is a morphological dig sequence among sf galaxies , which evolves from galaxies which reveal mostly bubbles and supershells to galaxies which show filamentary emission to cases of intense sf which reveal smooth edig layers ( i.e. halos ) .",

    "<S> this is in contrast to the more massive galaxies , which show smooth edig layers , unless they are powered by a superwind , as in the case of nucleated starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the simplistic chimney scenario is not confirmed from our observations , and future models need to take into account the detailed physics of feedback , star formation and magnetic fields . </S>"
