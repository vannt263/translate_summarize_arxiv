    "dielectronic recombination ( dr ) is an electron - ion collision process which is well known to be important in astrophysical and fusion plasmas@xcite . in dr the initially free electron",
    "is transferred to a bound state of the ion via a doubly excited intermediate state which is formed by an excitation of the core and a simultaneous attachment of the incident electron .",
    "this two step process @xmath14^ { * * } \\to a^{(q-1)+}+ h\\nu \\label{eq : dr}\\ ] ] involves dielectronic capture ( time - inverse auger process ) as the first step with a subsequent stabilization of the lowered charge state by radiative decay to a state below the ionization limit .",
    "this second step competes with autoionization which would transfer the ion back into its initial charge state @xmath15 with the net effect being resonant elastic or inelastic electron scattering .",
    "another recombination process , which in contrast to dr is non - resonant , is radiative recombination ( rr ) @xmath16 where the initially free electron is transferred to a bound state of the ion and a photon is emitted simultaneously .",
    "the cross section for rr diverges at zero electron energy and decreases rapidly towards higher energies . in the present investigation",
    "we regard rr as a continuous background on top of which dr resonances are emerging .    in the case of narrow",
    "non - overlapping dr resonances the dr cross section due to an intermediate state labelled @xmath17 can be well approximated by@xcite @xmath18 with the electron - ion center - of - mass ( c.  m. ) frame energy @xmath19 , the lorentzian line shape @xmath20 normalized to @xmath21 and the resonance strength @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the resonance energy , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the statistical weights of the initial ionic core @xmath26 and the doubly excited intermediate state @xmath17 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the rate for an autoionizing transition from @xmath17 to @xmath26 and the rate for a radiative transition from @xmath17 to states @xmath29 below the first ionization limit , respectively .",
    "the summation indices @xmath30 and @xmath31 run over all states which from @xmath17 can either be reached by autoionization or by radiative transitions , respectively .",
    "soon after the establishment of dr as an important process governing the charge state balance of ions in the solar corona@xcite , burgess and summers@xcite and jacobs et al.@xcite realized that dr cross sections should be sensitive to external electric fields present in virtually any plasma environment . the electric field enhancement of dr rates was subsequently reproduced in a number of theoretical calculations@xcite .",
    "briefly , the effect arises from the stark mixing of @xmath32 states and the resulting influence on the autoionization rates which , by detailed balancing , determine the capture of the free electron .",
    "autoionization rates strongly decrease with increasing @xmath32 and , therefore , only low @xmath32 states significantly contribute to dr .",
    "electric fields mix low and high @xmath32 states and thereby increase the autoionization rates of the high @xmath32 states and consequently also the contribution of high rydberg states to dr .",
    "the control of external fields in experiments using intense ion and electron beams is a challenge .",
    "results from early recombination experiments@xcite could only be brought in agreement with theory under the assumption that external electric fields had been present in the interaction region .",
    "the first experiment where external fields were applied under well controlled conditions was performed by mller and coworkers@xcite who investigated dr in the presence of external fields ( drf ) of singly charged mg@xmath33 ions .",
    "they observed an increase of the measured dr cross section by a factor of about 1.5 when increasing the motional @xmath34 electric field from 7.2 to 23.5 v / cm .",
    "the agreement of these results with theoretical predictions@xcite was at the 20% level .",
    "further drf experiments with multiply charged c@xmath35 ions also revealed drastic dr rate enhancements by electric fields@xcite ; however , the large uncertainties of these measurements left ambiguities .",
    "the first drf experiment using highly charged ions at a storage ring was carried out with si@xmath10 ions by bartsch et al.@xcite .",
    "it produced results with an unprecedented accuracy , enabling a detailed comparison with theory . whereas the overall agreement between experiment and theory for the magnitude of the effect ( up to a factor of 3 when increasing the field from 0 v / cm to 183 v / cm ) was fair , discrepancies remained in the functional dependence of the rate enhancement on the electric field strength .",
    "this finding stimulated theoretical investigations of the role of the additional magnetic field which is always present in storage ring dr experiments , since it is needed to guide and confine the electron beam within the electron cooler .",
    "in a model calculation robicheaux and pindzola@xcite found that in a configuration of crossed @xmath36 and @xmath37 fields indeed the magnetic field influences through the mixing of @xmath38 levels the rate enhancement generated by the electric field .",
    "more detailed calculations@xcite confirmed these results .",
    "it should be noted that in theoretical calculations by huber and bottcher@xcite no influence of a pure magnetic field of at least up to 5 t on dr was found .    inspired by these predictions we previously performed storage ring drf experiments using li - like cl@xmath11@xcite and ti@xmath12@xcite ions and crossed @xmath36 and @xmath37 fields where we clearly discovered a distinct effect of the magnetic field strength on the magnitude of the dr rate enhancement .",
    "the electric field effect decreased monotonically with the @xmath37 field increasing from 30  mt to 80  mt .",
    "a decrease of the electric field enhancement by a crossed magnetic field is also predicted by the model calculation of robicheaux and pindzola@xcite for magnetic fields larger than approximately 20 mt where , due to a dominance of the magnetic over the electric interaction energy , the @xmath32-mixing weakens and consequently the number of states participating in dr decreases . at lower magnetic fields @xmath38-mixing yields",
    "an increase of the dr rate with increasing @xmath37 field .",
    "a corresponding experimental observation has been made recently by klimenko and coworkers@xcite who studied recombination of ba@xmath33 ions from a continuum of finite bandwidth which they had prepared by laser excitation of neutral ba atoms .",
    "for a given electric field strength of 0.5 v / cm , they find that the recombination rate is increasingly enhanced by crossed magnetic fields up to about 20 mt . however , there is no effect of the magnetic field when it is directed parallel to the electric field vector . for the @xmath38-mixing to occur the crossed @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath37 arrangement is essential . in the case of",
    "parallel @xmath37 and @xmath36 fields @xmath38 remains a good quantum number and no influence of the magnetic field is expected .",
    "the aim of the present investigation with li - like ni@xmath0 is to extend the previous studies to an ion with even higher nuclear charge @xmath39 .",
    "because of the @xmath40 scaling of radiative rates it is expected that with higher @xmath39 less @xmath32 states of a given rydberg @xmath41 level take part in dr and therefore the sensitivity to @xmath32-mixing decreases@xcite .",
    "results of griffin and pindzola@xcite who calculated decreasing dr rate enhancements for increasing charge states of iron ions point into the same direction .",
    "another aspect of going to higher @xmath39 is that even high lying @xmath42 rydberg resonances are more separated in energy and therefore easier to resolve .",
    "this has been demonstrated by brandau et al .  who resolved @xmath43 dr resonances up to @xmath44 in the recombination spectrum of li - like au@xmath45 ions@xcite . when choosing ni@xmath0 we hoped to be able to study the field enhancement effect on a single @xmath46 resonance",
    "this would enable a quantitative comparison with theory which at present is limited to a single low value of @xmath41@xcite when explicitly treating all @xmath47 levels required for a realistic description of dr in crossed @xmath36 and @xmath37 fields .",
    "in our drf studies we have chosen li - like ions as test systems since on the one hand their electronic structure is simple enough to be treated theoretically on a high level of sophistication and on the other hand provides strong dr channels connected to the @xmath48 core excitations .",
    "the measurements have been performed at the heavy ion storage ring tsr@xcite of the max - planck - institut fr kernphysik in heidelberg . for a general account of experimental techniques at",

    "detailed descriptions of the experimental procedure for field free dr measurements have been given by kilgus et al.@xcite and more recently by lampert et al.@xcite .",

    "using multiturn injection and e - cool stacking@xcite ion currents of up to 3300 @xmath50a were stored in the tsr . at these high ion currents , however , intra beam scattering heated the ion beam during dr measurements resulting in a considerable loss of energy resolution . to avoid this and to limit the recombination count rate to below 1 mhz , i.  e.  to below a count rate where dead time effects are still negligible , we kept ion currents below 1 ma during all dr measurements . in the storage ring",

    "the electron cooler voltage was stepped through a preset range of values different from the cooling voltage , thus introducing non - zero mean relative velocities between ions and electrons .",

    "the cooler voltage was first set back to the cooling value in order to maintain the ion beam quality and then set to a reference value which is chosen to lead to a relative velocity where the electron - ion recombination signal is very small , favourably being only due to a negligible rr contribution ( reference relative energy @xmath73 ) . under this condition",
    "the recombination rate measured at the reference point monitors the background signal due to electron capture from residual gas molecules . choosing short time intervals of the order of only 10  ms for dwelling on the measurement , cooling and reference voltages ensured that the experimental environment did not change significantly between the signal and the background measurements .",

    "the fact that the increase of the integrated recombination rate coefficient is independent of the sign of the electric field vector is expected from the cylindrical symmetry of the merged beams arrangement in the electron cooler . however , for the entire experimental setup this symmetry is broken by the charge analyzing dipole magnet with an electric field vector lying in the bending plane ( the @xmath102-@xmath103 plane of the coordinate frame defined in the interaction region ) .",

    "is steeper for the @xmath193 series of rydberg resonances than that for the @xmath43 series .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the multiplicity of states and consequently the number of states which can be mixed is two times higher for @xmath222 than for @xmath221 .",
    "following this argument one would expect a ratio of 2 for the respective incremental integrated recombination rates @xmath255 . from our measurements we find lower values scattering around 1.5 indicating a somewhat reduced number of states available for field mixing within the series of ni@xmath198 dr resonances . in calculations for li - like si@xmath10 and c@xmath35 ions ratios , even less than 1 have been found@xcite .",
    "this has been attributed to the electrostatic quadrupole - quadrupole interaction between the @xmath256 and the @xmath154 rydberg electron in the intermediate doubly excited state , which more effectively lifts the degeneracy between the @xmath193 than between the @xmath257 levels .",
    "another reason for the reduced number of @xmath193 states participating in drf might be the existence of additional coster - kronig decay channels for these resonances with @xmath258 to ni@xmath259 ( cf .  section [ sec : resdr0 ] ) .",

    "the present results are compared with these previous data in fig .",
    "[ fig : allslopes ] .",
    "it should be noted that the comparison is only semi - quantitative , because the choice of integration ranges for the calculation of the integrated recombination coefficients is somewhat arbitrary and different cut - off quantum numbers @xmath169 exist for the different ions ( cf.table  [ tab : allions ] ) .",
    "clearly , the relative enhancement for a given electric field strength is much lower for ni@xmath0 than for the lighter ions studied so far , with the reduction for the step from lithium - like titanium ( @xmath260 ) to nickel ( @xmath261 ) apparently much larger than the step from , e.  g. , chlorine ( @xmath262 ) to @xmath260 . as a general trend with increasing @xmath39 , the radiative decay rates @xmath263 decrease @xmath264 for type i transitions ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : drlilike ] ) ) and @xmath265 for type ii transitions , while the autoionization rates are rather independent of @xmath39 .",
    "this shifts the range where the low-@xmath32 autoionization rates are larger than the radiative stabilization rates ( the condition for dr enhancement by @xmath32-mixing to occur @xcite ) down to states of lower principal quantum number @xmath41 for increasing @xmath39 .",
    "for ni@xmath0 the degree of mixing reached by the typical experimental field strengths appears to be much reduced as compared to lighter ions . in addition , a clear dependence of the electric field enhancement on the the magnetic field strength is no longer observed for ni@xmath0 . to clarify the reason for the strong reduction of both the electric and the additional magnetic field effect in the heavy system studied here , detailed quantitative calculations are desirable .",
    "external electric and magnetic fields are ubiquitous in astrophysical or fusion plasmas .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to look into the implications of the field enhancement effect for the ni@xmath0 @xmath202 dr rate coefficient in a plasma .",
    "as an example we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] the ratio of rate coefficients derived from two measurements with and without external electric field . as compared to zero electric field , the recombination coefficient at our highest experimental electric field strength ( @xmath266  v / cm at @xmath243  mt ) is enhanced by up to 11@xmath214 .",
    "this value only represents a lower limit for the enhancement at the given field strength , as we observe dr resonances due to ni@xmath267 intermediate states only up to @xmath268 .",
    "it should also be noted that in our experiments we did not reach the electric field strength where the dr rate enhancement saturates .",
    "the recombination of lithium - like ni@xmath0 ions has been experimentally studied in detail .",
    "spectroscopic information on individual dr resonances associated with ni@xmath269 intermediate states , which have been experimentally resolved up to @xmath270 , has been extracted and the @xmath202 dr plasma rate coefficient has been derived .",

    "results of detailed theoretical calculations are available@xcite which agree well with the experiment . at lower temperatures , where ni@xmath0 ions may exist in photoionized plasmas ,",
    "no data for the dr rate coefficient have been previously available .    in the presence of external electric fields up to 300  v / cm",
    ", the measured dr resonance strength is enhanced by a factor 1.5 ; a rather weak effect in comparison with previous measurements at @xmath271 , 17 and 22 . due to the overall weakness of the field effect for ni@xmath0 ions , a marked dependence of the dr rate enhancement on the strength of a crossed magnetic field",
    "as observed for cl@xmath11 and ti@xmath12 ions has not been detectable in the present investigation .",
    "experimental limitations prevented us from obtaining an energy resolution in our drf measurements comparable to that achieved in the field - free measurement .",
    "consequently , we could not resolve a ni@xmath269 dr resonance with @xmath41 high enough to exhibit a field effect .",
    "such an observation would have facilitated a direct comparison with _ ab initio _ calculations , which due to the large number of @xmath47 states to be considered , presently can only treat a single @xmath41 manifold of rydberg states in the presence of crossed @xmath36 and @xmath37 fields@xcite .",
    "improvements of this situation can be expected in the near future from the steady increase of computing power on the theoretical side , and on the experimental side from a dedicated electron target which is presently being installed at the tsr . with the electron target and the electron cooler operating at the same time we will be able to perform drf measurements with continuously cooled ion beams , yielding drf spectra with increased resolution .",
