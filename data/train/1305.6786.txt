    "plasma enhanced surface modification employs the energy of plasma - generated particles . for the technology computer - aided design of such processes ,",
    "the calculation of the flux , energy distribution , and angular distribution of the surface - incident particles is therefore of great importance @xcite . in theory , this poses no problems , as the foundation of plasma simulation is sound @xcite .",
    "all species of a discharge  electrons , ions , neutrals  can be described kinetically , i.e. by time evolution equations for the six - dimensional distribution functions @xmath0 in the domain @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is the spatial domain , i.e. the discharge chamber ; @xmath3 is the set of all velocities , and @xmath4 is a species index ) .    in practice , however , the problems are considerable .",
    "the numerical effort of directly solving kinetic plasma models is definitely deterring , at least for the foreseeable future .",
    "mathematical simplifications must be employed , and , therefore , compromises made .",
    "one option is to reduce the spatial dimension of the problem by assuming a planar or axisymmetric discharge geometry .",
    "stochastic solutions of the kinetic equations , based on the particle - in - cell approach with monte carlo collisions ( pic / mcc ) , are then feasible and indeed yield a lot of insight @xcite",
    ". however , this approach can not capture the often complicated geometries of real discharges .    if the latter requirement is an issue , alternatives to kinetic models must be sought .",
    "one possibility is the fluid approach where particles are not represented by distribution functions but only by fluid variables  typically by the number density and the flux , and , in the case of the electrons , the temperature .",
    "however , often kinetic aspects of the problem are significant and must be retained .",
    "this is the realm of  hybrid schemes  which combine fluid and kinetic arguments in some clever way , with the intent to achieve physically sound kinetic information without paying the price of a full kinetic simulation .",
    "however , the validity of such approaches is always an issue @xcite .",
    "our study is motivated by a particular type of hybrid scheme , namely one that couples a fluid description of the plasma bulk with a kinetic model of the plasma sheath . from the following ordering which is typical for processing ( where @xmath5 is the discharge size",
    ", @xmath6 is the ionization length , @xmath7 is the elastic ion mean free path , and @xmath4 is the sheath thickness ) , one can infer that it is solely the plasma bulk which determines the fluxes of the energetic species to the wall ( fluid quantities ) , while it is solely the sheath that determines the energy and angular distribution functions at the surface ( kinetic quantities ) : @xmath8    to determine the energy and angular distribution of the surface - incident particles , such a hybrid scheme should , thus , suffice .",
    "most simply , it may be implemented as follows : a fluid code ( which may be a hybrid code in other respects ) is run to its convergence .",
    "the fields of the final state ( or , in the rf case , of the final period ) are transferred to a monte - carlo module , which simulates the trajectories of a sufficiently large set of test particles and calculates the normalized distribution functions at the selected surface .",
    "the absolute distribution functions are finally found as products of the normalized functions with the respective fluxes ( to be determined from the fluid code ) .",
    "this approach has been implemented into many simulation codes , for example into the codes hpem and nonpdpsim by kushner @xcite and co - workers or the commercial codes comsol and cfd - ace @xcite .",
    "the scheme has , however , one essential drawback : it is not self - consistent on the kinetic level . to correct this deficiency",
    ", we have recently proposed the novel scheme , _ ensemble - in - spacetime _ ( est ) , which constructs a uniform solution of the kinetic equations for the particles and poisson s equation for the field , i.e. , provides a fully self - consistent kinetic simulation of the sheath .",
    "its input parameters are still fluid - dynamic : the fluxes of the energetic species , the voltage across the sheath , the electron temperature , and the composition of the neutral background @xcite .",
    "of course , this raises a question : how does est compare to a full kinetic scheme ? is the energy distribution of the ions incident on the surface given by the est scheme the same as the one calculated from a complete pic approach ?",
    "we will show that the answer to this question is positive . as a test ground",
    ", we will study the sheath dynamics in the regime where kinetic effects are most pronounced , namely in the intermediate regime where the applied radio frequency @xmath9 is comparable to the ion plasma frequency @xmath10 and the inverse ion sheath transit time @xmath11 . here",
    ", the ions can only partially respond to the time varying field in the sheath , and interesting effects can be observed like temporal asymmetries and phase shifts between applied voltage and ion energy @xcite .",
    "the set - up of our study is shown in .",
    "it is a single frequency capacitively coupled plasma driven at a voltage of @xmath12 and an rf frequency of @xmath13 .",
    "the electrode gap is @xmath14 , the gas is argon at a pressure of @xmath15 and a fixed temperature of @xmath16 .",
    "all particles that impact the two electrodes are absorbed , the emission of secondary electrons is neglected .",
    "a particular feature of the model is an additional ionization source @xmath17 assumed in the plasma bulk .",
    "the need for this additional source is purely technical : single - frequency ccps with gaps in the cm range can not be sustained at the assumed pressure and frequency .",
    "an alternative would have been to simulate a double frequency ccp or other hybrid discharge , but this would have made our results below more difficult to interpret .",
    "the first scheme used in this study is a benchmarked realization of pic / mcc @xcite .",
    "it is a one - dimensional planar ( 1d3v ) bounded implementation , which incorporates a monte carlo treatment of collision processes with the cross sections taken from @xcite.the additional bulk ionization source @xmath17 is modeled by electron - ion pair creation in a gaussian - shaped @xmath18-wide region in the center of the discharge ; the average energy of the new electrons is @xmath19",
    ". displays the obtained time averaged density profiles .",
    "shows the time resolved electrical potential .",
    "all expected features are visible , in particular the emergence of a quasineutral bulk with a relatively weak electrical field and of electron - depleted sheaths with much higher voltage drop .",
    "the plasma bulk has a positive potential relative to the electrodes , except for brief moments in the rf cycle , where electrons can reach the electrodes to balance the ion flux @xcite .",
    "the second algorithm studied in this manuscript , the _ ensemble - in - spacetime _",
    "( est ) , was designed as a tool for technology - oriented computer aided design ( tcad ) .",
    "it  provides a fast , kinetically self - consistent simulation of a dc or rf plasma boundary sheath and the resulting ion energy distribution .",
    "est differs from pic in several aspects.it does not simulate an entire discharge but only the sheath ; the  operation parameters ",
    " sheath voltage , ion fluxes , electron temperature  must be provided as an input . in our example , the sheath voltage is deduced from the potential as shown in , the ion flux is @xmath20 , and the electron temperature is @xmath21 . like pic",
    ", est has kinetic equations for the ions which are solved in a stochastic sense .",
    "however , the electrons are not treated kinetically but assumed to follow a boltzmann relation with given temperature , @xmath22 .",
    "finally , est has a different solution strategy than pic .",
    "it does not follow the transient evolution until it reaches a  converged  (= periodic ) state , but rather seeks within the space of all periodic sheath states for a solution of the equations of motion .",
    "the central structure of the algorithm is the name - giving _ spacetime _ , a discretized ( grid ) representation of the domain @xmath23\\times [ 0,\\tau_{\\rm rf}]$ ] . here",
    ", @xmath24 is the location of the electrode , @xmath25 is an arbitrary point deep in the plasma bulk , and @xmath26 is the rf period .",
    "the algorithm starts by assigning to each node @xmath27 of the spacetime a potential @xmath28 ; calculated with a fluid sheath model @xcite .",
    "then , three modules are iterated :    1 .",
    "a monte carlo module finds the trajectories of the _ ensemble _ , a large set of test ions .",
    "the ions are started at @xmath25 with their drift speed and uniform distribution in phase and are followed until they leave the system at @xmath24 .",
    "elastic collisions with isotropic and backscattering components with a spatial uniform background gas are performed in the same way as in the pic code .",
    "the set of all trajectories  illustrated in below",
    " represents the response of the ions to the field .",
    "a harmonic analysis module reconstructs from the calculated trajectories and from the prescribed flux the ion density @xmath29 for each node @xmath27 of the spacetime grid . by construction",
    ", it is a periodic quantity .",
    "3 .   a field module solves for each phase point @xmath30 the boltzmann - poisson equation with the calculated ion densities to update the potential .",
    "the electron density is obtained by boltzmann s relation , with the electron temperature as specified ; the boundary condition is derived from the prescribed sheath voltage .",
    "the iteration is terminated when the updates of the potential are sufficiently small .",
    "owing to the stochastic nature of the monte carlo module , the algorithm exhibits no convergence in the strict sense , but reasonable accuracy ( on the @xmath31 level ) can typically be achieved in less than five iterations .",
    "in spite of their different mathematical structure , both models yield very similar results . in the following",
    ", we will compare several quantities and comment on the likely causes of the remaining differences between est and pic .",
    "our first comparison  see  is between the phase averaged ion densities . the largest deviation can be seen in the bulk , increasing towards the discharge center .",
    "we believe that this deviation is due to the relatively low pressure , and it provides in fact an opportunity to illustrate one of the limitations of est : for argon at @xmath32 , the ion mean free path is @xmath33 .",
    "the pic ions , which are mostly born cold in the shaded ionization zone , travel only the same distance to the sheath edge .",
    "this does not suffice to establish drift equilibrium .",
    "the est ions , on the other hand , are started at @xmath25already with drift speed  in the logic of est , more specific (= non - fluiddynamic ) information is not available . in other words : for @xmath34 where ( 1 ) is marginally violated , also the bulk exhibits kinetic effects which are not captured by est .    in the sheath itself ,",
    "however , the named effect does not play a role , as the potential differences are much larger and both pic and est ions are far from drift equilibrium .",
    "the initial conditions matter less , and the agreement of the ion densities is much better .",
    "any remaining discrepancies are probably due to small differences in the treatment of collisions , and due to the fact that the est scheme assumes the electrons to be in boltzmann equilibrium , while the pic method treats them kinetically .",
    "( there may be a third possible cause for differences : est uses a noise - reducing fourier scheme to reconstruct the ion densities from the trajectories through the whole space - time , while pic has only access to the instantaneous state and can not remove any noise .",
    "however , this effect is not very influential . )",
    "the good agreement carries over to other sheath quantities : shows the ion energy distributions at the electrode , the phase resolved sheath thickness @xmath35 , calculated using the definition of @xcite , and the charge - voltage characteristics .",
    "the results of est ( solid line ) and of pic / mcc ( dotted line ) are nearly identical .    as discussed in the introduction",
    ", it is in particular the faithful representation of the ion energy distribution at the electrode that legitimates est as a post - processor .",
    "physically , however , the charge voltage characteristics of and its hysteresis is even more interesting : it demonstrates that both models capture kinetic effects correctly . to understand the argument ,",
    "consider the space - time trajectories of an ensemble of ions as displayed in . here , for simplicity , thermal spread  ion temperature  is neglected and ion - neutral collisions are turned off .",
    "the ions enter the depicted interval with bohm speed and with a uniform phase distribution . as long as they are outside the sheath , they experience no electric field and are not accelerated .",
    "this motion translates into a temporally constant ion density , see .",
    "however , once the ions cross the momentaneous sheath edge @xmath35 , they get accelerated and quickly drawn to the electrode . for @xmath36 ,",
    "this is clearly not a temporally symmetric effect , as more ions are collected when the sheath expands , as when it retracts .",
    "the ion flux in the sheath is thus temporally modulated , and so is the ion density @xmath37 see .",
    "the resulting global effect is the phase shift between the the sheath voltage @xmath38 and the sheath charge @xmath39 that was depicted in .",
    "clearly , the effect vanishes both for @xmath40 and @xmath41 : in the first case , the sheath expansion is slow compared to the ion speed and the sheath - entering flux is independent of phase . in the second regime ,",
    "the field changes too quickly for the ions to follow , and only the phase - averaged field determines the motion .",
    "the temporal asymmetry of the sheath charge - voltage relation surely impacts the overall behavior of a discharge",
    ". it will be interesting to reconsider the studies on the plasma series resonance @xcite and stochastic heating @xcite in the regime @xmath36 where a full @xmath42-@xmath43-hysteresis is present .",
    "two kinetic models have been compared in the intermediate radio frequency regime , particle - in - cell / monte carlo collisions ( pic / mcc ) and ensemble - in - spacetime ( est ) .",
    "the est model , resolving the sheath alone , yields ion energy distributions and charge - voltage - relations close to those obtained by the fully kinetic pic / mcc simulations , provided that the flux of the ions into the sheath , the sheath voltage , and the average electron temperature are known .",
    "it can , therefore , be used as a post - processor to restore kinetic information from the limited information provided by fluid plasma models .",
    "the gain in efficiency is considerable .",
    "however , the pic / mcc method remains the standard against which all other schemes must be compared .",
