    "following the work of fontana and srivastava @xcite , agarwal @xcite , cardimona , raymer , and stroud @xcite , and zhu and scully @xcite , a number of articles have appeared containing proposals for suppressing spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the suppression of spontaneous emission that one can achieve by placing an atom in a cavity whose radiation modes differ from those of free space , it is suggested in these articles that spontaneous emission in free space can be suppressed by applying an external radiation field to an atom having a specified level scheme .",
    "this is a rather remarkable result , since one might imagine that , owing to the very short correlation time of the vacuum field , such modification of spontaneous emission rates would be strictly forbidden .",
    "a prototypical level scheme that leads to suppression of spontaneous emission is that of zhu and scully @xcite ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "two excited states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are separated in frequency by @xmath2 .",
    "these states decay to the ground state @xmath3 with rates @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "what makes the decay scheme somewhat unusual is that states @xmath6 and @xmath1 are _ coupled directly by the vacuum field_. an external radiation field couples an auxiliary , _ metastable _",
    "state @xmath7 to both states @xmath6 and @xmath8 for certain values of the field strength and atom - field detunings , it is found that one can have a nonvanishing , significant , steady state probability for the atom to be in states @xmath9 or @xmath1 . as such , spontaneous emission from these levels",
    "is suppressed by the presence of the driving field .",
    "_ @xcite claim to have observed this effect in an experiment on sodium dimers .",
    "= 8 cm = 8 cm    the suppression of spontaneous emission has been explained in terms of a dressed state of the atom - field system that is decoupled from the vacuum radiation field @xcite .",
    "how is this decoupling accomplished ?",
    "is there any underlying structure in the proposed level schemes that can help one to understand this most surprising result ?",
    "it is the purpose of this article to address these questions . by considering a model problem",
    ", i will show that states @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be viewed as superpositions of two states , _ one of which is metastable_. it is this metastable state that is necessary for the total suppression of spontaneous emission .",
    "moreover , the decay dynamics required for total suppression of spontaneous emission implies that the level scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is isomorphic to a three - level lambda system .",
    "the lower two levels of the lambda system are _ both _ metastable , and each is coupled to the decaying state . as such , the total suppression of spontaneous emission can be explained in terms of conventional dark states and coherent population trapping @xcite .",
    "the experiment of xia et al @xcite will also be discussed .",
    "while the level scheme they study is relevant to this class of problems , the results they obtained can not be classified as a suppression of spontaneous emission .",
    "in the absence of the driving field , the equations for the evolution of the state amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 given by zhu and scully @xcite are    [ 1 ] @xmath13 where    @xmath14    the first question we must ask is whether or not these equations correctly describe the interaction of an atom with the vacuum radiation field .",
    "the answer to this question is not obvious . if we consider the energy levels shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] to be those of an isolated atom in free space , we immediately run into some problems . from the dipole selection rules , it is easy to show that the vacuum coupling from state @xmath9 to state @xmath1 must conserve orbital , spin - orbit , and total angular momenta @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , as well as the z - component of total angular momentum . as a consequence , states @xmath6 and @xmath1 _ must belong to different electronic state manifolds_@xmath18 this , in turn , implies that @xmath2 corresponds to a frequency that is orders of magnitude larger than the decay rates @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the rapid oscillation of state amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath12 with frequency @xmath2 brings into question the validity of the weisskopf - wigner approximation used for the derivation of eqs .",
    ". there is , perhaps , a more subtle point involved . starting from state @xmath9 , one can emit a photon taking the atom to state @xmath19 reabsorb this photon taking the atom to _ virtual state _",
    "@xmath20 reemit a photon taking the atom to state @xmath21 and reabsorb this photon returning the atom to state @xmath9 .",
    "this overall process constitutes an @xmath22rydberg ) contribution to the lamb shift of state @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , if the atomic states are renormalized to include the lamb shift , it is questionable as to whether the vacuum coupling in between states @xmath9 and @xmath1 should be included in eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "it thus appears unlikely that one can achieve the vacuum coupling indicated in eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) if these states correspond to eigenstates of a free , isolated atom , dressed by the vacuum field . on the other hand",
    ", it _ is _ possible to achieve this vacuum coupling if states @xmath9 and @xmath1 correspond to eigenstates of an atom plus some external field or , in some cases , to the states of a molecule @xcite .",
    "the most obvious atom candidate is a hydrogen atom in a static electric field @xcite .",
    "states @xmath9 and @xmath1 could then be chosen as linear combinations of the 2s and 3p states of hydrogen . the idea of using a hydrogen atom in a static electric field to modify the spontaneous emission spectrum is not new .",
    "zhu and scully mention it in their 1996 article @xcite , and fontana and srivastava gave a detailed analysis of the decay in their 1973 article @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could use a level scheme similar to that used by xia _",
    "@xcite , in which states @xmath9 and @xmath10 are superposition of singlet and triplet states in a molecule .",
    "i will return to the experiment of xia _ et al .",
    "iii .    in order to gain additional insight into this problem",
    ", i consider the level scheme shown in fig .",
    "states @xmath21 , @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 are eigenstates of an unperturbed hamiltonian . states @xmath24 and @xmath25 have opposite parity and are coupled by a constant potential @xmath27 @xcite . an external radiation field , having frequency @xmath28 couples state @xmath29 , which is assumed to be metastable , to state @xmath30 only .",

    "( note that this level scheme could correspond to hydrogen with state @xmath24 corresponding to @xmath35 , state @xmath25 to @xmath36 , and states @xmath21 , @xmath37 and @xmath7 to @xmath38 @xcite . in this case , @xmath39 for the @xmath40 state@xmath18 ) the goal of this calculation is to show that the level scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , a level scheme exhibiting conventional decay dynamics , can be mapped into that of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , a level scheme exhibiting somewhat unconventional decay dynamics .",
    "thus , the suppression of spontaneous emission can equally well be analyzed using the level schemes of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] or [ fig2 ] .",
    "it will be seen that the suppression of spontaneous emission can be explained in terms of conventional dark states when the level scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is used .",
    "the mapping between the two level schemes is achieved by identifying states @xmath9 and @xmath1 , appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , as eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian associated with fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , plus the potential @xmath41    = 8 cm = 8 cm    in the absence of decay , the effective hamiltonian for the level scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , in the rotating wave approximation , in an interaction representation , and with the energy of level @xmath42 taken equal to zero , can be written as @xcite @xmath43 where the order of the states is ( @xmath7,@xmath30,@xmath44 , @xmath45 is a rabi frequency ( taken to be real ) and @xcite @xmath46 states @xmath21 and @xmath47 have not been included in ( [ 3 ] ) since they are not needed for the present discussion of the decay dynamics of the excited states .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) can be diagonalized without much difficulty ; however , the desired comparison between the level schemes of figs . 1 and 2 is achieved by diagonalizing the @xmath48 subspace only .",
    "the new eigenstates are given by    [ 5 ] @xmath49 where @xmath50    in terms of these eigenstates , the transformed hamiltonian takes the form    @xmath51    where the order of the states is ( @xmath7,@xmath6,@xmath52 and a constant energy @xmath53 has been subtracted from the energy of each state .",
    "the equations of motion for the state amplitudes are    [ 9 ] @xmath54 it is now a simple matter to include decay into these equations .",
    "since spontaneous decay is governed by @xmath55 ; @xmath56 where    @xmath57    and since @xmath58 ; @xmath59 , it follows that eqs .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) , including decay , can be written as    [ 11 ] @xmath60 where    [ 12 ] @xmath61    this form of the equations is _ almost _ identical to that used in theories of suppression of spontaneous decay [ compare with eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ] based on the level scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for the equations to be_identical , _ and for the level schemes of figs . 1 and 2 to be isomorphic",
    ", one must require that    @xmath62    it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) that the only way this equation can be satisfied is to have @xmath63 .",
    "in other words , the form of the vacuum coupling given in eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) for the level scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] in theories of total suppression of spontaneous",
    "_ necessarily implies that state _",
    "@xmath64 _ of the equivalent level scheme _ _ of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] _ _ must be metastable_.    since both states @xmath25 and @xmath7 are metastable and do not undergo spontaneous emission in the isolated atom , it is reasonable to ask whether or not the level scheme of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] legitimately qualifies to be labeled as one in which spontaneous emission has been suppressed . in order to determine",

    "( [ 11 ] ) , one finds that the only steady state solution is @xmath66 any initial state population in states @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays if the driving field is absent .",
    "this is easily understood in terms of the original @xmath24 , @xmath31 basis ; although state @xmath25 is metastable , it is coupled to the decaying state @xmath24 by the potential @xmath41 no matter how weak the coupling strength @xmath67 , any initial population in state @xmath25 eventually leaks out via state @xmath68    does the presence of the driving field suppress this spontaneous emission ?",
    "the answer to this question is affirmative if the initial state is an arbitrary superposition of states @xmath9 and @xmath10 and their remains population trapped in states @xmath6 and @xmath1 as the time approaches infinity .",
    "an initial condition in which the atom is in state @xmath69 corresponding to the initial condition in the experiment of xia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , can not be used directly to establish total suppression of spontaneous emission , but can provide indirect evidence for this effect , as discussed in sec .",
    "iii below .",
    "having established that state @xmath25 must be metastable to satisfy the requirements for spontaneous emission suppression , it is now an easy matter to understand the total suppression of spontaneous emission by returning to the original hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "an inspection of this hamiltonian reveals that it is identical to a hamiltonian , written in a field interaction representation @xcite , that characterizes a three - level atom in a lambda scheme driven by two fields .",
    "the field having rabi frequency @xmath45 and detuning @xmath70 drives the @xmath71-@xmath42 transition and the field having rabi frequency @xmath67 and detuning @xmath72 drives the @xmath42-@xmath73 transition @xcite .",
    "total suppression of spontaneous emission occurs if one can find an eigenstate consisting of a superposition of state amplitudes @xmath74 and @xmath75 which is decoupled from state amplitude @xmath76 .",
    "this _ dark state _",
    "@xcite does not decay since it is a superposition of nondecaying states .",
    "in other words we seek values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 for which the superposition of state amplitudes of the form @xmath79 satisfies the equation of motion @xmath80 from schrdinger s equation with the hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) , it follow that @xmath81 equation ( [ 16 ] ) can be satisfied only if @xmath82 @xmath83 which implies that @xmath84 .",
    "the driving field must be tuned to the frequency that would correspond to a  hole  in the emission spectrum from the 2 - 3 state manifold @xcite .",
    "thus if @xmath85 there always exists a dark state amplitude of the system @xmath86 where @xmath87 which does not decay .",
    "the other eigenstate amplitudes    [ 14 ] @xmath88 where    @xmath89    contain an admixture of state amplitude @xmath76 and decay as @xmath90 . as a consequence , any initial condition for which @xmath91 has a metastable component that does not decay as the time approaches infinity .",
    "it remains only to establish that an initial condition of the form @xmath92 leads to a final state which has some population trapped in states @xmath9 and @xmath1 ( or , equivalently , in state @xmath93 as @xmath90 , the solution for the total dressed state amplitudes @xmath94 is @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 , which , when reexpressed in terms of the bare state initial conditions [ with @xmath98 $ ] is @xmath99 . the final state populations are    [ 21 ] @xmath100    where eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5p ] ) and ( [ 19s ] ) were used .",
    "thus , we see that population is always trapped in states @xmath9 and @xmath101    equations ( [ 21 ] ) for the probabilities @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 can be written in terms of the couplings and detunings in the ( @xmath29,@xmath9,@xmath52 basis . referring to eq .",

    "is tuned to the energy of the metastable level @xmath73 ; that is , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .    as an aside",
    ", i might note that the results can be reinterpreted as a suppression of absorption @xcite if one starts with all population initially in state @xmath7 , for which @xmath114 as @xmath90 . in the absence of the coupling potential @xmath27 ,",
    "the steady state population @xmath115 would vanish , but it does not vanish in the presence of this coupling . in this sense , it is closely related to electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the origin of the suppression of spontaneous emission proposed by zhu and scully @xcite and others @xcite can be traced to a metastable state that is  hidden  in their calculations .",
    "once this hidden state is revealed , the suppression of spontaneous emission can be understood in terms of a conventional dark state and coherent population trapping @xcite that can arise when an atom having a three - level , lambda scheme is driven by two fields . the dark state in this instance is a superposition of two metastable states so is , itself , metastable .",
    "the dynamical suppression of spontaneous emission is a real effect .",
    "if the external driving field @xmath45 were not present , the two state manifold consisting of states @xmath9 and @xmath1 would always decay . in some sense , the driving field allows one to access the metastable level @xmath25 contained in both states @xmath9 and @xmath116 .",
    "this type of dynamical suppression could be used , for example , to reduce spontaneous emission in the @xmath40-@xmath117 manifold of hydrogen resulting from stray fields that couple the @xmath118 state to the @xmath119 state .",
    "it would be necessary to drive the @xmath40-@xmath117 transition using an _ rf _ field and the @xmath120-@xmath117 with a uv field having frequency @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "the use of the equivalent ( @xmath122 basis rather than the ( @xmath123 basis greatly simplifies the interpretation of the results . from the analysis of sec .",
    "ii , it is clear that the final state probabilities depend only on the initial state amplitude @xmath124 /r_{b}$ ] and not on the decay rate if state @xmath24 decays to state @xmath3 only .",
    "if state @xmath24 decays to state @xmath26 as well as to state @xmath21 , or if states @xmath7 and @xmath21 actually correspond to the same state@xmath125 the final state probabilities are modified , but the steady state still corresponds to a dark state for which there is total suppression of absorption . on the other hand , if state @xmath29 is not metastable , there can not be total suppression of spontaneous emission since the dark state amplitude @xmath126 /r_{b}$ ] decays to zero as @xmath90 .",

    "the singlet component of states @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays to state @xmath21 and the triplet component of states @xmath9 and @xmath1 decays to state @xmath47 , while the singlet component of states @xmath9 and @xmath1 is driven by a two - photon transition from the ground state . since _ both _ the singlet and triplet components decay ,",

    "they found that , for a tuning of the incident field midway between levels @xmath9 and @xmath127 , 2@xmath131 , the scattering in the singlet channel was suppressed and that in the triplet channel was enhanced .",
    "this constitutes strong evidence that states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are coupled directly by the vacuum field , and that the singlet and triplet states are degenerate in the absence of the spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath132 @xmath133 ) @xcite .",
    "although this experiment is important insofar as it provides an example of a system in which vacuum coupling of two , distinct excited states occurs , it does not demonstrate suppression of spontaneous emission",
