    "the * h*igh * a*cceptance * d*i-*e*lectron * s*pectrometer ( hades ) @xcite , now becoming operational , allows a new series of measurements being of high relevance for contemporary strong interaction physics . among the problems addressed",
    "are heavy - ion experiments searching for further indications of chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "hades is well - equipped to study also elementary hadron reactions since at gsi , besides heavy - ion beams , proton and pion beams are available , and hydrogen or deuterium targets can be used .",
    "this allows a detailed study of the reactions @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where a subtle @xmath0 interference is expected @xcite . in these reactions",
    "the excitation of intermediate baryon resonances is important .",
    "thus , the baryon resonance dynamics becomes accessible .",
    "we are going to show the sensitivity of various observables on individual resonance properties .",
    "a solid understanding of the excitations of the nucleon , which constitutes the majority of luminous mass in the universe , is still lacking as highlighted by the  missing resonances  predicted by models but not yet identified .",
    "also the link of baryon resonance parameters to qcd lattice results @xcite is still challenging .",
    "coupled channel approaches @xcite are well suited for simultaneously analyzing the wealth of data on hadron induced reactions on the nucleon . since we restrict ourselves to a narrow energy region around thresholds and to the special reaction @xmath1 we resort to a schematic born term model with only @xmath5 and @xmath6 channels .",
    "the heart of the exclusive reaction is the subprocess @xmath7 , @xmath8 with subsequent decay @xmath9 .",
    "we take into account in the isoscalar channel the nucleon and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , while the nucleon and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the four @xmath18 states @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are accounted for in the isovector channel .",
    "the interaction lagrangians and parameters ( cut - offs , couplings , phases etc . )",
    "are listed in @xcite ; the latter ones are from @xcite .",
    "if ones denotes the corresponding amplitude as @xmath23 the isospin rotated amplitude becomes @xmath24 pointing to different interferences in both reactions .",
    "indeed , as exhibited in figure 1 , below the threshold of    -6 mm     and @xmath25 channels .",
    "the polar angle is @xmath26 in the @xmath27 center - of - mass system.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath25 channels .",
    "the polar angle is @xmath26 in the @xmath27 center - of - mass system.,title=\"fig : \" ]        and @xmath25 channels .",
    "the polar angle is @xmath26 in the @xmath27 center - of - mass system.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath25 channels .",
    "the polar angle is @xmath26 in the @xmath27 center - of - mass system.,title=\"fig : \" ]    -12 mm    @xmath28 gev the differential cross sections of both reactions are quite different , while above threshold they are similar . below threshold ,",
    "the destructive interference between the @xmath29 and @xmath25 contributions in the reaction @xmath30 are responsible for this behavior ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the energy dependence of the differential cross sections are displayed in figure 3 at fixed invariant mass of @xmath31 gev . with changing energy also the individual contributions of the baryon resonance change , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "we emphasize that the influence of the baryon resonances changes with the angle of the outgoing @xmath32 pair .",
    "-6 mm     gev , @xmath26).,title=\"fig : \" ]   gev , @xmath26).,title=\"fig : \" ]    -12 mm        gev , @xmath26).,title=\"fig : \" ]   gev , @xmath26).,title=\"fig : \" ]    -12 mm",
    "along the above outlined approach one can also perform a combined study of near - threshold @xmath25 and @xmath33 production . here , the inclusion of the @xmath34 channel with the @xmath29 meson exchange becomes important .",
    "we found @xcite that within the conventional meson - nucleon dynamics the deviation from the standard ozi rule violation in these processes can naturally be explained without invoking any strangeness content in the nucleon when including properly the baryon resonances .",
    "this conclusion is addressed mainly to the ratio of the @xmath35 and @xmath36 coupling constants , because the resonance contributions to the total cross section of the @xmath33 meson production is rather weak .",
    "the status of the ozi rule for @xmath37 and @xmath38 interactions may be checked by considering more sensitive ( spin dependent ) variables and in @xmath25 and @xmath33 photoproduction at large angles @xcite .",
    "an experimental study of the reactions @xmath30 and @xmath39 allows to pin down the isoscalar part of the electromagnetic current and to reveal the role of the subthreshold @xmath40 resonances .",
    "details of the @xmath0 interference depend on the transition couplings nucleon - baryon resonance - meson .",
    "the knowledge of the mentioned reactions is a necessary prerequesit for analyzing forthcoming data of the reaction @xmath41 to be studied at hades .",
