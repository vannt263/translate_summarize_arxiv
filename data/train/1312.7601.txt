    "further theoretical investigation revealed the generic conditions under which conductance quantization appears in systems with constrictions @xcite .",
    "it is predicted that conductance of corbino disks in 2deg is also quantized , yet in odd - integer multiples of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental confirmation of this result is missing so far .    in the case of graphene",
    ", theoretical calculations predict the emergence of conductance quantization in multiples of @xmath0 for nanoribbons ( gnrs ) as well as for systems with modulated width @xcite .",
    "experimental demonstration of these phenomena is challenging , mainly due to the role of disorder and boundary effects @xcite .",
    "these issues encourage us to study other systems exhibiting conductance quantization which may be more resistant to the above - mentioned factors .",
    "transport properties of the full corbino disk in graphene were discussed by numerous authors @xcite .",
    "in contrast to a  similar disk in 2deg @xcite , conductance of the graphene - based system is not quantized . in the case of finite disk sections , systems with wide opening angles",
    "@xmath6 ( see fig.[fig : disk - section ] ) should exhibit a behavior similar to complete disks as currents at the edges play a minor role . on the other hand ,",
    "narrow section strongly resemble gnr , and thus one could raise a question : _ at which opening angle the quantization will emerge ?",
    "_ in this paper we show that conductance steps may appear for disk sections , provided that the ratio of outer to inner radius @xmath7 is large , and the opening angle is narrow .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we discuss solutions of the dirac equation for a system with cylindrical symmetry . following berry and mondragon @xcite , we then impose the so - called infinite - mass boundary conditions @xcite . in sec .",

    "as the wavefunctions should in general posses cylindrical symmetry , we start from the analysis of the full disk .",
