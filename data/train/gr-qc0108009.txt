    "in this paper we will examine the thin string limit of solutions of the field equations for an infinite length straight cosmic string [ described by a complex scalar field coupled to a @xmath0 gauge field ] coupled to gravity .",
    "the thin string limit has been examined by a number of authors [ 14 ] and it is generally agreed that in the thin string limit the metric describing an infinite length static cosmic string becomes that of a conical spacetime @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the usual @xmath3-periodic coordinate of cylindrical polar coordinates .",
    "if one changes to a new angular variable @xmath4 , where @xmath5 $ ] , the metric becomes that of minkowski space so we see that ( 1 ) represents a conical metric with angular deficit @xmath6 .",
    "if one also makes the weak - field approximation then one can also show ( see e.g. vilenkin @xcite ) that the angular deficit @xmath7 is related to the mass per unit length @xmath8 of the the string in a simple way : @xmath9 ( where we are using units in which @xmath10 ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the study of `` simple line sources '' in general relativity made by israel @xcite .",
    "he showed that if one has a 1-parameter family of spacetimes with the matter tending to a simple line source in the limit then , providing the radial stress becomes negligible compared to the mass density , the energy - momentum tensor becomes that of an infinitely thin wire with distributional stress energy .",
    "this analysis was applied by linet @xcite to a critically coupled cosmic string ( i.e. a string for which the scalar and vector fields have equal masses ) who showed that equation ( 2 ) is satisfied in this case .",
    "however as pointed out by garfinkle @xcite , in the non - critical case israel s condition is violated and there fails to be a simple relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the thin string limit .",
    "futamase and garfinkle @xcite argue that because the relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath8 depends upon the nature of the matter which makes up the string there is in general no well defined thin string limit for cosmic strings in general relativity .",
    "this interpretation agrees with the analysis of conical spacetimes by geroch and traschen , who showed that different 1-parameter families of spacetime with a conical spacetime as the limit could have different limiting mass per unit length .",
    "note however that if one puts certain additional conditions on the 1-parameter families of spacetime then one _ does _ recover formula ( 2 ) ( see for example wilson @xcite and clarke @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulty of having a well defined thin string limit in general relativity comes from the non - linear nature of the field equations . for a linear theory such as electromagnetism a consistent framework for describing concentrated sources",
    "is provided by schwartz s theory of distributions .",
    "this is for two reasons .",
    "firstly the equations are linear with respect to sources and fields so the field equations are well defined for distributional sources .",
    "secondly for smooth sources close to a point charge ( in the topology on the space of distributions ) the field produced is close to that produced by a point charge .",
    "it is this second feature which means that in electromagnetism the detailed internal structure of a concentrated source is unimportant and only the distributional charge density that it defines in the limit is significant .    in this paper we will consider the thin string limit of cosmic strings by making use of generalised functions belonging to the simplified colombeau algebra @xmath11 .",
    "the construction of the simplified colombeau algebra is outlined in section 2 but the key point to note here is that it provides a consistent setting which allows one to multiply distributions in a non - linear theory such as general relativity .",
    "furthermore if two generalised sources are close ( in the appropriate topology ) then the corresponding metrics ( satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions ) are also close .",
    "although @xmath11 contains distributions @xmath12 as a vector subspace , the algebra has a much richer structure because it is able to encode non - linear information .",
    "thus one can use these algebras to model the thin string limit of a cosmic string coupled to gravity because one is able to retain certain features of the source in the limit .",
    "this explains why one can use them to define the thin string limit even in case when there is not a simple relationship between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline the construction of the simplified colombeau algebra . in section 3",
    "we illustrate the ideas by considering the thin string limit of a static cosmic string in minkowski space . in section 4",
    "we consider the thin string limit of a static cosmic string coupled to the gravitational field and in section 5 examine the relationship between the angular deficit and mass per unit length . in section 6",
    "we introduce the conical approximation and in section 7 we briefly consider the case of a dynamic cosmic string coupled to gravity .",
    "in this section we give a brief introduction to the colombeau algebras . for more details see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to consider generalised functions as 1-parameter families of smooth functions @xmath13 .",
    "our basic space will thus be @xmath14 we may represent a smooth function by the constant family @xmath15 , but for a function of finite differentiability we may obtain a family of smooth functions by taking the convolution with a suitable smoothing kernel or molifier @xmath16 @xmath17 however for the case of a smooth function we would like both representations to be equivalent . using a taylor series expansion to compare the difference between these expressions we are lead to define two representations to be equivalent if they differ by a ` negligible function ' which is defined as a 1-parameter family of functions which on any compact set vanishes faster than any given positive power of @xmath18 . since we are trying to construct a _ differential algebra _ we also require the derivatives of @xmath19 to satisfy this property and the resulting set @xmath20 to be an ideal .",
    "unfortunately @xmath20 is not an ideal in @xmath21 , but by restricting the space to ` moderate functions ' @xmath22 which grow no faster than some inverse power of @xmath18 , one does have an ideal and we may define the differential algebra @xmath11 as the quotient .    *",
    "definition * ( moderate functions ) @xmath23 note @xmath24 indicates that @xmath25 is _ compact _ and we have also employed the standard multi - index notation for @xmath26 .",
    "* definition * ( negligible functions ) @xmath27 * definition * ( simplified algebra ) @xmath28 thus a non - linear generalised function is represented by a moderate sequence of smooth functions modulo a negligible sequence .",
    "the space @xmath22 is a differential algebra with pointwise operations and since the space of negligible functions is a differential ideal , @xmath29 is also a commutative differential algebra . as remarked earlier",
    "one of the advantages of the colombeau approach is that one may frequently interpret the results in terms of distributions using the concept of association or weak equivalence .",
    "an element @xmath30 $ ] of @xmath29 is said to be associated to a distribution @xmath31 if a representative @xmath32 in @xmath33 satisfies @xmath34 and we then write @xmath30 \\approx t$ ] .",
    "note that not all elements of @xmath29 are associated to distributions .    more generally we say @xmath30 \\approx [ g_\\epsilon]$ ] if @xmath35 association is an equivalence relation which respects addition and differentiation",
    ". it also respects multiplication by _ smooth _ functions but by the schwartz impossibility results can not respect multiplication in general .",
    "the algebra presented above is the simplest of the colombeau algebras .",
    "furthermore the notion of smooth function and the growth conditions in the definitions of moderate and negligible functions only depend upon the differential structure .",
    "this allows the simplified algebra to be readily generalised to arbitrary manifolds .",
    "however it does suffer from the disadvantage that the embedding of @xmath36 functions and distributions is not canonical .",
    "thus one has to appeal to mathematical or physical arguments outside the theory to justify a particular representation of a non - smooth function .",
    "for the case of the field equations for a cosmic string coupled to gravity , we will see in the next section that there is a natural scaling of the coupling constants which can be used as the colombeau parameter .",
    "in other cases one can embed by taking the convolution with an element of some special function space and only use general properties of elements of the space in proving results .",
    "however this is not always satisfactory and in certain situations the full colombeau algebra is preferable .",
    "this involves enlarging the algebra substantially by making the generalised functions depend upon the molifier .",
    "this allows one to construct a canonical embedding of distributions but at the expense of problems with coordinate invariance . a manifestly coordinate independent construction of the full algebra",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "we consider cosmic strings which are described by a complex scalar field @xmath16 which is coupled to a vector field @xmath37 .",
    "the equations of motion for these fields may be derived from the lagrangian @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gauge covariant derivative with coupling constant @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we write @xmath16 in the form @xmath42 and consider the case of a potential given by @xmath43 .",
    "then the lagrangian becomes @xmath44 here @xmath45 is a coupling constant and @xmath46 is twice the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field . for the above lagrangian",
    "the mass term for the scalar field is given by @xmath47 while that for the vector field is given by @xmath48 so that the mass terms are equal and the string is critically coupled when @xmath49 .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor corresponding to the lagrangian ( [ s1 ] ) is given by @xmath50 we now look for solutions describing an infinite length static cylindrically symmetric cosmic string in minkowski space . following garfinkle",
    "@xcite we therefore assume that the scalar and gauge fields have the form @xmath51\\nabla_{\\mu}\\phi \\label{s6b }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 are the usual cylindrical polar coordinates for minkowski space .",
    "the number @xmath53 is the winding number for the string which for simplicity we will take to be one in the remainder of the paper . with this choice",
    "the equations of motion are given by @xmath54 \\label{s7}\\\\ \\rho\\frac{d}{d\\rho}\\biggl(\\rho^{-1}\\frac{dp}{d\\rho}\\biggr )   = e^2s^2p .",
    "\\label{s8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the requirement that the solution has finite energy implies that @xmath55 on the other hand at the centre the solution must smoothly attain the symmetric state which requires @xmath56 the fields describing the cosmic string are therefore solutions of ( [ s7 ] ) , ( [ s8 ] ) satisfying ( [ b1])([b4 ] ) .    with the fields taking the form ( [ s6a ] ) , ( [ s6b ] ) the energy - momentum tensor is diagonal and is given in terms of @xmath57 and @xmath58 by @xmath59 where @xmath60 \\label{sigma } \\\\      p_\\rho = \\half\\biggl[\\biggl(\\frac{ds}{d\\rho}\\biggr)^2   - \\frac{s^2p^2}{\\rho^2 } - 2\\lambda(s^2-\\eta^2)^2 +   \\frac{1}{e^2\\rho^2}\\biggl(\\frac{dp}{d\\rho}\\biggr)^2\\biggr ] \\label{prho}\\\\      p_\\phi = \\half\\biggl[-\\biggl(\\frac{ds}{d\\rho}\\biggr)^2 +   \\frac{s^2p^2}{\\rho^2 } - 2\\lambda(s^2-\\eta^2)^2   + \\frac{1}{e^2\\rho^2}\\biggl(\\frac{dp}{d\\rho}\\biggr)^2\\biggr ] .",
    "\\label{pphi }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mass per unit length in minkowski space is therefore given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is given by ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "although the fields extend to infinity , they decay exponentially fast . for large @xmath63 the asymptotic behaviour",
    "is given by @xmath64 so that @xmath62 also decays exponentially fast .",
    "we therefore define an `` effective radius '' @xmath65 for the cosmic string by requiring that 90% of the total mass per unit length is within this radius and hence @xmath66 note that the effective radius is roughly the compton wavelength of the scalar field which for typical values of the coupling constants is of the order of 300 planck lengths .",
    "if we define @xmath67 , then numerical investigations show that @xmath68 is very close to 1 as @xmath40 , @xmath45 and @xmath69 vary over several orders of magnitude .",
    "thus in practice most of the matter is highly concentrated on the axis of the string .",
    "for this reason it is natural to try and model a cosmic string by taking a thin string limit in which all the matter is concentrated on the axis .",
    "however as noted by a number of authors ( see eg @xcite ) there are problems in simply using a @xmath70-function to model the source .",
    "the approach adopted in this paper is to allow @xmath40 @xmath45 and @xmath69 to depend upon a parameter @xmath18 so that @xmath71 with the physical values given by @xmath72 and the thin string limit given by letting @xmath18 tend to zero .",
    "we then consider the corresponding 1-parameter family of solutions @xmath73 and @xmath74 of ( [ s7])([b4 ] ) which we regard as elements of @xmath33 , whose equivalence classes @xmath75 $ ] and @xmath76 $ ] are elements of @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath11 is a differential algebra we may compute the energy - momentum tensor ( and other physically interesting quantities ) within @xmath11 . whether these quantities have",
    "an interpretation in terms of the usual theory of distributions will depend upon whether they are associated to a conventional distribution .",
    "we now consider the properties we require of the thin string limit in order that it retains the important features of the the physics . in order that @xmath77 represents the thin string limit we require that the effective radius @xmath78 defined by ( [ effective ] ) scales linearly with @xmath18 , while the mass per unit length @xmath79 is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "we also require that the relative strength of the coupling between the scalar and vector field given by @xmath80 compared to the self - coupling of the scalar field given by @xmath81 is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "we therefore try and choose the scaling for @xmath82 , @xmath81 and @xmath83 so that @xmath84 in fact conditions ( [ i])([iii ] ) uniquely determine the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath82 , @xmath81 and @xmath83 to be given by @xmath85 to see this we start by observing that after a suitable rescaling the only significant parameter in ( [ s7 ] ) and ( [ s8 ] ) is the ratio of the coupling given by @xmath86 .",
    "thus a solution to ( [ s7 ] ) and ( [ s8 ] ) satisfying ( [ b1])([b4 ] ) is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are solutions of @xmath90 \\label{7}\\\\      r\\frac{d}{dr}\\biggl(r^{-1}\\frac{dy}{dr}\\biggr ) = \\alpha x^2y \\label{8 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath91 substituting for @xmath92 and @xmath93 using ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) in the expression ( [ sigma ] ) for @xmath62 we find that @xmath94 where @xmath95 ^ 2+\\frac{1}{r^2}x^2(r)y^2(r)+2[x^2(r)-1]^2+\\frac{1}{\\alpha r^2}[y'(r)]^2\\biggr\\}.\\ ] ] the corresponding mass per unit length is then given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 since @xmath98 is independent of @xmath18 we see that for the mass per unit length to be independent of @xmath18 we also require that @xmath83 is independent of @xmath18 so that @xmath99 we next introduce a scaling factor @xmath100 defined by @xmath101 then in order to make @xmath102 independent of @xmath18 we see that @xmath81 must scale according to @xmath103 we now calculate how the effective radius depends upon @xmath100 .",
    "we first let @xmath104 be the total mass per unit length within a radius @xmath63 so that @xmath105 where @xmath106 is given by @xmath107 now when @xmath108 we require @xmath109 so that we want @xmath110 but by requirement ( [ i ] ) @xmath111 so that we need @xmath112 which implies that @xmath113 is constant ( since h is increasing ) and since we require @xmath114 we must have @xmath115 we have therefore established the following proposition .",

    "we next calculate the corresponding value of the energy density @xmath118 . substituting ( [ c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) into the expression for @xmath62 ( [ sigma ] ) we find @xmath119",

    "we therefore transform to minkowski coordinates @xmath133 and find that the corresponding distributional energy - momentum tensor @xmath134 is given in these coordinates by @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "we note that @xmath138 and @xmath139 are bounded but have a directional dependent limit .",
    "indeed the functions @xmath140 and @xmath141 are precisely the directional dependent functions that appear in the conical metric when written in cartesian coordinates ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "more importantly in the classical theory of distributions one can only multiply elements of @xmath12 by _ smooth _ functions so that the entries in the second matrix in ( [ cart ] ) do not define elements of @xmath12 .",
    "it is not hard to extend the notion of multiplication in @xmath12 in some ad hoc way to allow these sort of products ( see for example oberguggenberger @xcite ) but instead we prefer to calculate the energy - momentum tensor within @xmath11 . to do this we _",
    "first _ calculate the ( @xmath18-dependent ) energy - momentum tensor in minkowski coordinates for the 1-parameter family of solutions given by ( [ c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) .",
    "this tensor is regular ( even on the axis ) and the components define elements of @xmath33 whose equivalence classes define elements of @xmath11 . thus @xmath142 $ ] for @xmath143 is a well defined element of @xmath11 .",
    "one can then show , for example that @xmath144 \\approx   \\big[\\frac{2dxy}{x^2+y^2}\\delta^{(2)}(x , y)\\big]\\ ] ] where the product on the right hand side is within @xmath11 ( and hence well defined ) .",
    "an important special case of the field equations occurs for critical coupling , where the masses of the scalar and vector fields are equal . with our choice of numerical factors in the definition of the fields and coupling constants ,",
    "critical coupling occurs when @xmath49 ( or @xmath145 ) . in this case",
    "one can show that the field equations reduce to the bogomolnyi equations @xcite which in cylindrical symmetry are given by @xmath146 substitution into ( [ prho ] ) and ( [ pphi ] ) shows that for the case of critical coupling @xmath147 and thus @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and hence @xmath150 and @xmath151 vanish .",
    "furthermore in the case of critical coupling one may integrate ( [ sigma ] ) by parts and use ( [ e ] ) and ( [ f ] ) to show that for winding number @xmath53 the mass per unit length is given by @xmath152 which leads to @xmath153 \\approx \\mu\\delta^{(2)}(x , y)\\hbox{diag}(1,0,0,1).\\ ] ] thus in the case of critical coupling the distributional energy - momentum tensor takes the form that is usually used in the thin string limit . as we have seen above this is a valid choice for a critically coupled cosmic string where @xmath129 and @xmath130 vanish and for such strings it is reasonable to describe the energy - momentum tensor using conventional @xmath70-functions which do not model any internal structure .",
    "however for _ non - critical _ coupling the energy - momentum tensor is more complicated and can not be modeled adequately using conventional distributions but can be described using non - linear functions belonging to the simplified colombeau algebra . because of the ` micro - local ' structure of elements of this algebra one can take the thin string limit but still retain some features of the internal structure of the source in the limiting energy - momentum tensor .",
    "in this section we examine the physically more important case of a cosmic string coupled to gravity .",
    "we again consider the case of an infinite length static cosmic string , so the lagrangian is still given by ( [ s1 ] ) , with @xmath16 and @xmath37 taking the form given by ( [ s6a ] ) and ( [ s6b ] ) , but with the indices in the lagrangian raised using a general static cylindrically symmetric metric rather than that of minkowski space used in the previous section .",
    "such a metric may be written in the form @xmath154 this is a special case of the generalised jordan , ehlers , kundt and kompaneets metric ( with the twist @xmath155 ) used by sj \" odin @xcite in analysing dynamic cosmic strings .",
