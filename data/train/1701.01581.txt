    "general relativity has been lately more successful than ever , see for instance the recent direct observation of gravitational waves @xcite by the ligo collaboration . however , we still cryingly lack a satisfactory explanation for numerous holes in our understanding of the universe",
    ". one of these holes is the accelerated expansion of the universe which , in the standard lore , can be accounted by a bare cosmological constant .",
    "this current view is probably just a temporary placeholder for a more fundamental explanation ; it is for instance still unclear how and whether vacuum energy is to be taken into account , considering the relatively small value of the acceleration or cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the accelerated expansion is a large distance phenomenon . a direct way to tackle",
    "the problem is thus to depart from general relativity in the ir , for instance , by adding a small mass to the graviton .",
    "were the resulting models to conclude in favour of an expendable bare cosmological constant , or a screening of a large  natural  cosmological constant , we would indeed have found an appreciable solution to the puzzle @xcite .",
    "more generally , the possibility of the graviton having a mass , or any other modification in the ir , changes the rules of late time cosmology , thus potentially offering new paths to a better understanding of late - time accelerated expansion .",
    "in addition to the phenomenological applications of considering alternatives to general relativity , the quest for a viable theory of massive gravity is also of theoretical interest , as it has proved since its early years to be a challenging task . fierz and pauli were the first , in 1939 , to propose a theory for a massive spin-2 field on a minkowski background @xcite .",
    "many decades later , theories of massive gravity were shown however not to coincide with general relativity in their massless limit @xcite , issue known as the vdvz discontinuity , and to be accompanied by a ghost @xcite , the boulware - deser ghost .",
    "although the first problem was quickly recognised by vainshtein to be an artifact of the linearity of the theory @xcite , the second had to wait until the ghost - free massive gravity model @xcite by de rham , gabadadze , and tolley ( drgt ) , in 2010 , to be cured .",
    "it was then quickly shown that viable cosmology remained difficult - even in the at the time newly found drgt model @xcite .",
    "several routes have been since explored such as further modification of the original theory @xcite or breaking either homogeneity or isotropy of the solution at the background level @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we combine two ideas of modification of the original drgt model .",
    "the first of these two ideas was introduced in an intent to add a scalar field to the drgt theory @xcite .",
    "the form of the action is restricted by a scaling - type global symmetry and the additional scalar field resembles a dilaton scalar field to some extent .",
    "for this reason the added scalar field is often called the quasidilaton .",
    "although it was eventually recognized that the self - accelerating cosmological solutions were in general unstable in the original quasidilaton theory @xcite , these were later cured by further extensions @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for a possible new type of solutions in the decoupling limit . ) in particular the extended quasidilaton massive gravity has proved to be well - behaved in the presence of matter @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for previous studies of the extended quasidilaton with matter . )",
    "the second of the two ideas is to remove the problematic degrees of freedom by imposing adequate constraints and to obtain a theory of massive gravity with , as in general relativity , two tensor modes only @xcite .",
    "the theory constructed in this way is thus called the minimal theory of massive gravity ( mtmg ) and provides a nonlinear completion of the self - accelerating solution  @xcite found in the original drgt theory .    by combining the aforementioned two approaches we obtain a theory with three degrees of freedom , one scalar due to the quasidilaton extension , supplemented by the remaining two tensor modes of the mtmg .",
    "we thus call this theory the _ minimal quasidilaton_. the theory of minimal quasidilaton that we shall develop in the present paper allows for a self - accelerating de sitter solution with stable dynamics of perturbations , in a wide region of the parameter space .",
    "we illustrate this by presenting in detail the allowed parameter space in some chosen cases .",
    "while the mtmg @xcite , the extended quasidilaton @xcite and the new quasidilaton @xcite themselves provide stable cosmological solutions with self - acceleration , the minimal quasidilaton theory possesses its own advantages . from the viewpoint of extending the quasidilaton theory",
    ", the minimal quasidilaton theory has a smaller number of propagating degrees of freedom and thus the stability is easier to establish compared to other extensions . from the viewpoint of extending the mtmg ,",
    "the choice of the fiducial metric / vielbein in the minimal quasidilaton theory is simpler than the original theory .",
    "these advantages make it worthwhile investigating the theory of minimal quasidilaton in detail .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : precursor ] , we start by presenting a short review of the original precursor theory that was introduced in @xcite to construct the mtmg , in its unitary gauge formulation . we then proceed to establish its covariant formulation via the introduction of stckelberg fields .",
    "the extension with the quasidilaton scalar field and the associated global symmetry is presented in section [ sec : quasidilaton - precursor ] .",
    "we next recover the unitary gauge formulation of the new precursor theory with a quasidilaton field , by fixing the stckelberg fields . a hamiltonian analysis",
    "is then performed , which allows us , in section [ sec : hamiltonian ] , to promote the precursor theory to the minimal theory by adding two constraints to the precursor hamiltonian . in section",
    "[ sec : lagrangian ] , we return to the the lagrangian picture via a legendre transformation , and write down the action for the minimal quasidilaton theory both in the vielbein and in the metric formalisms .",
    "we then finally explore the behaviour of the theory in de sitter backgrounds ( section [ sec : desitter ] ) and their minkowski limit ( section [ sec : minkowski ] )",
    ". the action for the minimal quasidilaton theory , as well as the analysis of background and linear perturbations in the self - accelerating de sitter solution and its minkowski limit , are the principal results of the paper .",
    "we review here the construction of the precursor theory for the mtmg in the unitary gauge , presented in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to this reference for more details .",
    "the theory uses as basic ingredients the lapse function @xmath0 , the shift vector @xmath1 , the spatial vielbein @xmath2 , and the corresponding fiducial quantities @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . one also defines the dual basis @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , of both sets of vielbeins so that @xmath8 in addition to these quantities , it is useful to introduce the two spatial metrics  physical and fiducial  and the combinations @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , defined by @xmath13 and @xmath14 we denote the inverses of @xmath9 and @xmath10 as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",

    "inclusion of matter in the cosmological context is also an important issue since the evolution of cosmological perturbations is expected to be different from general relativity . in the mtmg without the quasidilaton , it is known that there are two distinct branches of cosmological solutions . in the so called self - accelerating branch of the mtmg ,",
    "the evolution of scalar- and vector - type linear perturbations as well as the flrw background is exactly the same as that in @xmath329-cdm . in the other branch of the mtmg , on the other hand , while the vector - type linear perturbations are absent as in the @xmath329-cdm , the scalar - type linear perturbations tend to show a weaker gravity at late time in accord with some of recent observations @xcite . it would be interesting to study how the scalar - type cosmological perturbations behave in the minimal quasidilaton with matter .",
    "while the recent direct detection of gravitational waves by aligo put an upper bound on the mass of gravitational waves as @xmath330 @xcite , in the context of the self - accelerating solution of the mtmg and the minimal quasidilaton the current acceleration of the cosmic expansion suggests even lower value of order @xmath331 .",
    "therefore it is certainly important to push forward the observational upper bound as much as we can . from the theoretical point of view , it is also important to investigate whether a small graviton mass is technically natural in the context of the mtmg and the minimal quasidilaton , as in the drgt theory @xcite .",

    "for the general flrw ansatz ( [ eqn : flrwansatz ] ) , we show in this appendix that combining equations of motion and time derivatives of some of them , we can obtain an algebraic equation for @xmath176 of the form @xmath332 where @xmath333 is a linear polynomial of @xmath176 whose coefficients depend on @xmath137 , @xmath218 , @xmath334 but do not depend on @xmath335 , @xmath336 , @xmath337 etc .",
