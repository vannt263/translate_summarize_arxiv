    "at what epoch did the first generation of galaxies and quasars form",
    "? how was the universe re - ionized , ending the `` dark ages '' ( @xcite ) ?",
    "these fundamental questions can only be answered with studies of high - redshift objects .",
    "the last few years have witnessed the first direct observations of galaxies at redshift higher than five ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , see also the review by @xcite ) , while detailed studies of the ensemble properties and large scale distribution of galaxies at @xmath17 have begun ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "several quasars have been found at @xmath18 ( fan et al .  1999 , 2000a , @xcite ) , including a low - luminosity quasar at @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "studies of high - redshift quasars provide important probes of this critical epoch in cosmic evolution .",
    "the lack of the gunn - peterson ( 1965 ) effect in the absorption spectrum of a @xmath20 quasar ( @xcite ) indicates that the universe is already highly ionized at that redshift .",
    "the exact epoch of re - ionization could be determined from the absorption spectra of quasars at even higher redshift ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the study of the luminosity function of high - redshift quasars will constrain models of quasar and galaxy evolution ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and determine whether it was uv radiation from agns or from young massive stars that re - ionized the universe , ending the `` dark ages '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "measurements of the chemical abundance in the quasar environment will reveal the metal production process at the very early stage of galaxy evolution ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , luminous high - redshift quasars represent high peaks of density fields , and may be the markers of large scale structure at these early epochs ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) is using a dedicated 2.5 m telescope and a large format ccd camera ( @xcite ) at the apache point observatory in new mexico to obtain images in five broad bands ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath1 and @xmath24 , centered at 3540 , 4770 , 6230 , 7630 and 9130  , respectively ; @xcite ) over 10,000 deg@xmath16 of high galactic latitude sky .",
    "the multicolor data from sdss have proven to be very effective in selecting high - redshift quasars : more than 50 quasars at @xmath25 have been discovered to date from about 600 deg@xmath16 of imaging data ( fan et al .",
    "1999 , 2000a , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the inclusion of the reddest band , @xmath24 , in principle enables the detection of quasars up to @xmath26 in sdss data .    in this paper , we report the discovery of sdssp j104433.04012502.2 ( the name reflecting its j2000 coordinates from the preliminary sdss astrometry , accurate to @xmath27 in each coordinate ) , a very luminous , `` @xmath1-dropout '' quasar at @xmath0 , selected by its very red @xmath28 color . in a @xmath29-dominated flat universe (",
    "@xmath30 = 65 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , referred to as the @xmath29-model in this paper , @xcite , @xcite ) , @xmath0 corresponds to an age of 0.9 gyr in an universe 13.9 gyr old , or a look - back time of 93.2% of the age of the universe .",
    "similarly , the universe was 0.7 gyr old at @xmath0 in a universe 13.0 gyr old at present for a model with @xmath33 and @xmath30 = 50 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , which we refer to as the @xmath33 model in this paper .",
    "we present the photometric observations and target selection in  2 , and the spectroscopic observations in  3 . in  4 , we discuss the cosmological implications , including the constraints on the gunn - peterson effect , quasar evolution models , and black hole formation .",
    "the object sdssp j104433.04012502.2 ( hereafter sdss 10440125 for brevity ) was selected from the sdss imaging data based on its extremely red @xmath34 color .",
    "the photometry of this object is summarized in table 1 .",
    "the photometric observations of this region were obtained by the sdss imaging camera on 2000 march 4 during the sdss commissioning phase . for off - equator scans ,",
    "the telescope moves along a great circle , with the photometric camera drift - scanning at the sidereal rate .",
    "the effective exposure time is 54.1 seconds in each band .",
    "the seeing in the @xmath1 and @xmath24 bands was about @xmath35 .",
    "the photometric calibration is provided by an auxiliary 20-inch telescope at the same site ( uomoto et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "the photometric zeropoint is accurate to about 7% in @xmath21 and @xmath24 and 2% in @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath1 . because the definition of the photometric system is not yet finalized , we quote measured magnitudes using asterisks ( e.g. , @xmath36 ) to represent preliminary photometry , while referring to the filters with primes ( e.g. , @xmath1 ) .",
    "sdss 10440125 is undetected in @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the object is detected at the 5-@xmath37 level in the @xmath1 band .",
    "the @xmath24 detection is of very high significance , with @xmath38 .",
    "data are quoted as asinh magnitudes ( @xcite ) and are on the ab magnitude system ( @xcite ) .",
    "finding charts for sdss 10440125 in the @xmath1 and @xmath24 bands are shown in figure  1 .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the colors of high - redshift quasars are strong functions of redshift in the sdss filter system , as first the ly@xmath8 forest and then the lyman limit systems move through the filter system . at @xmath39 , quasars become very red in @xmath40 while remaining blue in @xmath41 , and can be readily distinguished from stars based on these colors . at @xmath42 , quasars become very red in @xmath41 .",
    "they are easily distinguished from red stars in the @xmath41 vs. @xmath28 color - color diagram ( fan et al .  1999 , 2000a ) .",
    "quasars at @xmath43 have very similar @xmath41 and @xmath28 colors to those of late m stars .",
    "finally , at @xmath44 , the ly@xmath8 emission line begins to move out of the sdss @xmath1 filter . with a predicted @xmath45 ,",
    "quasars at such redshifts become @xmath1-band dropout objects . however , unlike the lower - redshift @xmath22 and @xmath23-dropout quasars , these quasars have only one measurable optical color , as they will be completely undetected in @xmath23",
    ". the sdss alone can not provide a constraint on the quasar s continuum shape redward of the ly@xmath8 emission .",
    "it is thus difficult to distinguish them from other classes of red objects without additional information , such as near - infrared photometry ( see also zheng et al .",
    "2000 ) or detection in the radio or x - ray .",
    "in fact , the only other known class of stellar objects with such red colors ( @xmath45 ) are the extremely cool stars / substellar objects with spectral type l or t ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most of these objects are brown dwarfs with mass below the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "although l and t dwarfs are very rare on the sky ( the density for l dwarfs is 1 per @xmath46 deg@xmath16 for @xmath47 , @xcite ) , they are still more numerous than are @xmath48 quasars , and are the major contaminants of searches for @xmath1-dropout quasars . near infrared photometry",
    "can be used to separate high - redshift quasar candidates from these cool dwarfs : the continuum shape of quasars is relatively flat towards near - ir bands , while the flux of l dwarfs continues to rise sharply towards longer wavelengths .",
    "we have selected @xmath1-dropout candidates with @xmath45 and @xmath49 from about 600 deg@xmath16 of sdss imaging data .",
    "these 600 deg@xmath16 overlap the publicly released area of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) .",
    "sdss 10440125 is the only @xmath1-dropout source in the 2mass covered area that is _ not detected _ at the 7-@xmath37 level in any band in the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "all other sources are detected in at least one band at more than 10 @xmath37 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "is the non - detection in 2mass sufficient to rule out the possibility that sdss 10440125 is a brown dwarf ? in this area of the sky , the 2mass point source catalog has 7-@xmath37 limiting magnitudes of roughly @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this indicates a 7-@xmath37 upper limit on the optical - ir colors of sdss 10440125 : @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "there are three l dwarfs in fan et al .",
    "( 2000b ) that have @xmath56 : sdss 03300025 ( @xmath57 , spectral type l2 ) , sdss 05390059 ( @xmath58 , l5 ) and sdss 13260038 ( @xmath59 , l8 ) .",
    "they all have @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( see tables 2 and 5 in @xcite ) .",
    "although the current l dwarf sample is small , the @xmath34 and the @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) colors seem to be reasonable indicators of the spectral type for l dwarfs ( @xcite , @xcite ) therefore , if sdss 10440125 ( @xmath66 ) had been an l dwarf , we would expect it to have been detected by 2mass with high significance .",
    "thus the non - detection in the 2mass passbands indicates that sdss 10440125 is unlikely to be a l dwarf , but is rather a source with a much flatter ir continuum , such as a quasar at @xmath67 or a compact galaxy at @xmath68 .",
    "a @xmath69-band image of sdss 1044 - 0125 was obtained on the night of 2000 april 17 , using the near infrared camera ( nirc , matthews & soifer 1994 ) on the keck  i telescope under photometric skies and good seeing .",
    "the observations consisted of a nine - point dither pattern , integrating for 3 @xmath70 10s coadds at each location .",
    "the data were flattened , sky - subtracted , shifted , and stacked using the dimsum package in iraf .",
    "the images show sdss 1044 - 0125 to be an unresolved point source with fwhm = @xmath71 .",
    "photometry through a 2  radius aperture yields @xmath72 , referenced to the standards of persson et al .",
    "there are no companions or associated structure within 20  of the quasar to a @xmath73 point source limiting magnitude of @xmath74 .",
    "low and high dispersion spectra of sdss 10440125 were obtained with the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ; @xcite ) on the keck ii telescope on the night of 2000 april 6 .",
    "the night was photometric with @xmath75 seeing .",
    "a 1200 second exposure was taken through a @xmath76 slit in the low - dispersion mode of esi . in this mode ,",
    "a prism is used for dispersion .",
    "the spectrum covers 3900   to about 10000  .",
    "the dispersion varies roughly linearly with wavelength from 0.8  / pixel at 3900   to 10  / pixel at 10000  .",
    "in addition , two 1200 second high resolution spectra were taken through a @xmath77 slit in the echellette mode of esi . in this mode , the spectral range of 3900   to 11000   is covered in ten spectral orders with a constant dispersion of 11.4 km s@xmath6 pixel@xmath6 .",
    "wavelength calibrations were performed with observations of hg - ne - xe lamps in the low - dispersion prism mode , and a cu - ar lamp in the echellette mode .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard g191-b2b ( @xcite , @xcite ) was observed for flux calibration .",
    "all observations were carried out at the parallactic angle .",
    "the data were reduced with standard iraf routines .",
    "figure 2 shows the final spectrum combining the low and high dispersion observations ( total exposure time of 3600s ) , over a wavelength range of 4500 - 10000  , and binned to 4  / pixel .",
    "the telluric absorption bands were removed using the standard star spectrum .",
    "the absolute flux scale of the spectrum is adjusted so that it reproduces the sdss @xmath78 magnitude .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio at @xmath79   is 15  20 per pixel .",
    "the spectrum of sdss 10440125 shows the unambiguous signature of a very high redshift quasar : the broad and strong ly@xmath8+nv emission line at @xmath80 with a sharp discontinuity to the blue side , due to the onset of very strong ly@xmath8 forest absorption .",
    "the flux level drops by a factor of @xmath81 from the red side to the blue side of the ly@xmath8+nv emission .",
    "a ly@xmath82+ovi emission line is detected at @xmath83 7000  , with an additional flux decrement due to the onset of ly@xmath82 forest absorption lines .",
    "the spectrum shows no detectable flux at @xmath84 because of the presence of a lyman limit system ( see  4 ) .",
    "redward of ly@xmath8 , two additional emission lines , oi+siii@xmath85 and siiv+oiv]@xmath86 are also clearly visible .",
    "the synthetic @xmath28 color calculated from the spectrum in figure 2 is 2.5 , consistent with the sdss measurement .",
    "the redshift determination of such an object is not straightforward .",
    "the ly@xmath8 emission line is severely affected by the strong ly@xmath8 forest lines ( as well as by possible internal absorption lines ) . for @xmath87 quasars , schneider , schmidt & gunn ( 1991 ) show that the peak of the ly@xmath8 emission line is typically at rest - frame 1219  , but with a large scatter .",
    "another strong line , civ@xmath88 1549 , is out of the range of our spectrum . oi+siii@xmath85 and siiv+oiv]@xmath86 are relatively weak .",
    "we use the central wavelengths of these two blends from @xcite .",
    "gaussian fits of these two lines are listed in table 2 .",
    "based on these fits , we adopt a redshift of 5.80 @xmath89 0.02 for sdss 10440125 .",
    "objective measurement of the equivalent width of the ly@xmath8 line is difficult ( see the discussion by schneider , schmidt & gunn 1991 ) . using the continuum level determined from the red side of ly@xmath8 emission , we find the rest - frame equivalent width of ly@xmath8 + nv is @xmath90  . however , this number is clearly an underestimate due to the extreme ly@xmath8 absorption , maybe by a factor of two .",
    "figure 2 indicates that the expected line center of ly@xmath8 at @xmath0 is severely absorbed , and that the blue wing of the line has almost completely disappeared .",
    "the measurement of the ly@xmath82+ovi line is difficult as well .",
    "we smooth the spectrum of figure 2 to estimate the continuum level , and find an equivalent width of @xmath91 .",
    "this value is also highly uncertain due to the difficulty in defining a `` continuum '' in the ly@xmath8 forest region .",
    "it is interesting to note that the strengths of the oi+siii@xmath85 and siiv+oiv]@xmath86 line blends are comparable to those at much lower redshift : the average rest frame equivalent widths of these two lines are @xmath92   and @xmath93   in the sample of 30 quasars at @xmath94 in schneider , schmidt & gunn ( 1991 ) , compared to 3.4 and 7.0   in the case of sdss 10440125 .",
    "previous studies have shown that quasar environments at @xmath94 have roughly solar or higher metallicities ( @xcite ) .",
    "although we can not derive the metallicity of sdss 10440125 based on these emission line measurements , the existence of strong lines suggests that in this system , the metallicity is already quite high at this redshift . assuming the metals were produced in stellar evolution , the initial starburst and chemical enrichment of the quasar environment must have happened at a very early epoch .    from the spectrum in figure 2 ,",
    "we derive its continuum ab magnitude at rest frame 1280  , @xmath95 , after correcting for interstellar extinction ( @xmath96 , from the map of @xcite ) . in the @xmath29-model ( see  1 ) , sdss 10440125 has an absolute magnitude @xmath97 . assuming a power law continuum with @xmath98 we find @xmath99 and @xmath100 . in the @xmath33 model (  1 )",
    "it has @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 . in this cosmology",
    ", the nearby luminous quasar 3c273 has @xmath104 .",
    "sdss 10440125 is a very luminous quasar , about twice as luminous as 3c 273 ( assuming that it is not amplified by lensing or beaming ) .",
    "sdss 10440125 is detected neither in the first radio survey ( @xcite ) at the 1mjy level at 20 cm wavelength , nor in the rosat all sky survey ( @xcite ) , implying a 3-@xmath37 upper limit of @xmath105 ergs @xmath106 s@xmath6 in the 0.1  2.4 kev band .",
    "these result is not unexpected ; only a few @xmath107 quasars have observed x - ray or radio fluxes above this value ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a deep exposure with chandra or xmm is needed to determine its x - ray properties .",
    "the high luminosity of sdss 10440125 makes it an ideal object for high signal - to - noise ratio observations to study the intergalactic medium at high redshift . in order to detect continuum break caused by the lyman limit system ,",
    "an edge filter with width of 40   was convolved with the low resolution spectrum in figure 2 .",
    "a strong peak at 6131   is detected in the convolved spectrum , indicating the existence of a lyman limit system at @xmath108 .",
    "no flux is detected blueward of this break .",
    "a lyman limit system is usually detected within 0.1 of the emission redshift in essentially all quasars at @xmath107 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the most striking feature of the spectrum of sdss 10440125 is the very strong absorption caused by ly@xmath8 forest lines .",
    "however , the flux level in the ly@xmath8 forest region never reaches zero .",
    "it lacks the gunn - peterson ( 1965 ) trough that would exist in the spectrum of a quasar at redshift higher than the re - ionization redshift ( @xcite ) , indicating that the intergalactic medium is already highly ionized at @xmath12 .",
    "we estimate the average continuum decrements as : @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the observed and the unabsorbed continuum fluxes of the quasar , and @xmath112 and @xmath113 measure the decrements in the region between rest - frame ly@xmath8 and ly@xmath82 ( @xmath114  ) and between ly@xmath82 and the lyman limit ( @xmath115  ) , respectively ( @xcite ) .",
    "the measurements of @xmath112 and @xmath113 require knowledge of the continuum shape redward of ly@xmath8 .",
    "however , with @xmath112 approaching unity , the effect of different slopes is quite small . assuming a power law continuum @xmath116 with @xmath117 , as indicated in figure 3 , we obtain @xmath9 and @xmath113 = 0.94 . using a slope of 1.0 only changes the @xmath112 and @xmath113 values to 0.92 and 0.96 , respectively .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "these values are in close accordance with those from quasar rd j030117 + 002025 ( @xmath19 , @xcite ) and from distant galaxies in the hubble deep field ( @xcite ) , and are much higher than that of the @xmath120 quasar sdssp j033829.31 + 002156.3 ( @xmath121 , @xcite ) , suggesting that the strong evolution of the strength of the ly@xmath8 forest at @xmath122 , @xmath123 , measured at redshifts below five continues to a redshift of nearly six . assuming this number density evolution , @xcite and @xcite show that at @xmath124 , the expected average @xmath112 ranges from 0.8 to 0.9 .",
    "we further derive an upper limit on the gunn - peterson optical depth following songaila et al .",
    "figure 3 shows the high - resolution echellette spectrum of sdss 10440125 in the ly@xmath8 forest region ( binned to 2  / pixel ) .",
    "the continuum level is approximated by a @xmath125 power law as above .",
    "even the most transparent part of the forest does not return close to the continuum level at this resolution .",
    "it is evident that the ly@xmath8 forest is much stronger in sdss 10440125 than in sdssp j033829.31 + 002156.3 ( figure 2 of @xcite ) , where a fraction of the forest has flux comparable to the extrapolated continuum . in the region between 7926",
    "  and 7929  , sdss 10440125 has an optical depth @xmath126 , where the error bar only reflects the statistical noise in the spectrum ( note the noise level indicated in the figure ) .",
    "this value changes to 0.40 and 0.31 for power law slopes of 0.0 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we adopt a conservative limit of @xmath13 at this redshift of 5.52 . with higher resolution and signal - to - noise ratio , we might be able to select regions even less affected by the ly@xmath8 forest lines .",
    "therefore , it is only an upper limit . for comparison , songaila et al .",
    "derived @xmath128 for @xmath129 with similar resolution .",
    "the gunn - peterson effect analysis above is based on an attempt to measure the amount of flux between ly@xmath8 forest lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at redshift",
    "higher than five , even with a moderately high resolution spectrum , these forest lines overlap , making it impossible to find a truly `` line - free '' region . modern hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic models show that under the influence of gravity , the intergalactic medium becomes clumpy , and the gunn - peterson optical depth should vary even in the lowest column density regions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the minimum absorption regions in the forest merely represent regions that are most underdense in this fluctuating gunn - peterson effect .",
    "an accurate measurement of the gunn - peterson effect and the ionizing background from the high resolution spectrum of sdss 10440125 requires detailed comparison with cosmological simulations ; this is beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "figure 2 also shows the detection of an intervening mgii absorption system .",
    "the mgii doublet @xmath130 is detected at wavelengths 9166.7   and 9190.3   in the high - resolution spectrum ; the redshift of this system is @xmath131 . the rest frame equivalent widths of the doublet lines are 2.43 and 1.90  , respectively .",
    "this system is very similar to the one detected in sdssp j033829.31 + 002156.3 ( @xmath132 , @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that sdss 10440125 is amplified by lensing from this intervening absorber .",
    "however , we saw in ",
    "2 that this object is _ unresolved _ under @xmath133 seeing in the k band .",
    "the total area of sdss imaging data that we have searched for high - redshift quasars thus far is of order 600 deg@xmath16 .",
    "all that satisfy @xmath134 and @xmath135 in this 600 deg@xmath16 region have been observed spectroscopically .",
    "only sdss 10440125 is identified as a high - redshift quasar ; the remaining objects are l and t dwarfs . using the luminosity function and redshift dependence of @xcite ( for the @xmath33 model ) , extrapolating it to higher redshifts and assuming @xmath98",
    ", we predict that in a total area of 600 deg@xmath16 , for @xmath136 ( @xmath1-dropout objects ) , there should be 1.5 quasars with @xmath137 and 1.1 quasars with @xmath138 . for @xmath139 ,",
    "the extrapolation predicts 1.1 and 0.8 quasars for @xmath137 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "this assumes that our selection efficiency is 100% .",
    "the schmidt - schneider - gunn luminosity function is derived using objects with @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "although it is difficult to draw any reliable conclusion from the observation of a single high - redshift quasar , the discovery of sdss 10440025 is consistent with the expectations from this rather large extrapolation from lower redshift results .",
    "assuming that the same luminosity function holds at even higher redshift , the sdss will be able to discover one quasar at @xmath143 , @xmath144 in every 1500 deg@xmath16 of the survey .",
    "sdss 1044 - 0125 is a very luminous quasar . assuming that ( 1 ) its bolometric luminosity equals the eddington luminosity , @xmath145 ; ( 2 ) its intrinsic continuum spectrum is the same as the mean spectral template of @xcite , and ( 3 ) neither beaming nor lensing affects the observed flux , we find a black hole mass of @xmath146 in the @xmath29model , or @xmath147 in the @xmath33 model . in either case , the implied black hole mass is quite large , similar to that of the black hole at the center of the nearby giant elliptical galaxy m87 ( harms et al .",
    "1994 , macchetto et al .",
    "if the quasar were radiating below the eddington limit , the inferred black hole mass would be even higher . in the @xcite template , @xmath148 of the bolometric luminosity",
    "is emitted in the observed @xmath149 band .",
    "if this fraction is larger for sdss 1044 - 0125 , the implied black hole mass would be reduced .",
    "note that the universe was less than 1 gyr old at this redshift , while the eddington time scale , the @xmath150-folding time for the growing of a black hole shining at the eddington luminosity , is @xmath151 yr , where @xmath152 is the radiative efficiency for the accretion .",
    "if the black hole started accreting with an initial mass of @xmath153 with 10% efficiency , the seed black hole would have to form and begin accreting at redshift well beyond 10 in order to grow to @xmath154 at @xmath0 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "forming such a massive black hole in such a short time is a remarkable feat .",
    "the observations of high - redshift quasars can be used to constrain the formation epoch of the first star clusters and the fueling process of early black holes .",
    "how likely is it to find a quasar like sdss 1044 - 0125 in popular cold dark matter cosmological models ?",
    "we use the following simple model to estimate the abundance of high - redshift quasars ( see also @xcite ) : @xcite have found a correlation between central black hole mass and bulge mass , @xmath155 in nearby galaxies . if this correlation holds at high redshift , this would imply a bulge mass of @xmath156 ( @xmath29-model ) or @xmath157 ( @xmath33 ) for the host galaxy of sdss 1044 - 0125 , and a lower limit of @xmath158 ( @xmath29-model ) or @xmath159 ( @xmath33 ) for its dark halo , assuming @xmath160 .",
    "the comoving abundance of dark matter halos at this epoch is very sensitive to this halo mass , and can be estimated by means of the @xcite formalism . in a @xmath29-cdm model , assuming @xmath161 and an untilted primordial power spectrum , for parent halo masses of @xmath162 m@xmath163 , @xmath164 m@xmath163 , and @xmath165 m@xmath163 , we expect 50,000 , 60 , and 4 candidate halos respectively within the survey volume in a redshift window @xmath166",
    ". the duty cycle of quasar activity is poorly known , but is certainly much less than unity ( @xcite ) .",
    "given these uncertainties , this model is not contradictory to our discovery of a single quasar like sdss 1044 - 0125 in the 600 deg@xmath16 survey area .",
    "note that this model does not address the physical process by which the massive black hole formed .",
    "the assumptions we made about @xmath167 and the lifetime of the quasars are completely untested at high redshift . indeed , rix et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argue that the host galaxies of @xmath168 quasars are appreciably less luminous than the universal @xmath169 hypothesis would imply . because of its high luminosity , sdss 1044 - 0125 likely probes the exponential , high  mass tail of the underlying dark halo distribution , making predictions of the expected number counts also sensitive to cosmological parameters , especially the normalization of the power spectrum ( i.e. @xmath170 ) . in principle , the sdss survey will be able to probe quasars @xmath171 mag fainter than sdss 1044 - 0125 , and could reveal tens of additional sources at @xmath172 .",
    "the detection of these objects will yield strong constraints on cosmological models for the formation and evolution of quasars at very high redshifts .",
