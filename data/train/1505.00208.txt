    "this work suggested the presence of a bistability of activity states in the system , with the moving lines representing boundaries between sets of cells in different activity regimes .",

    ", neurons could fire on even or odd cycles of the stimulus , resulting in an intrinsic bistability for the forced system .",
    "sufficiently strong coupling , even if directionally unbiased , elicited unidirectional traveling waves in which cells were recruited to switch phase .",
    "large amplitude forcing of an excitable system is a difficult problem to tackle analytically . in view of that difficulty",
    ", the more recent analysis of  @xcite assumed that each neuron is intrinsically oscillatory and characterized by a state evolving at half the frequency of an applied forcing signal . using multiple time scale expansion and the fredholm alternative",
    ", the authors of  @xcite derived a more analytically tractable _ effective model _ for the time evolution of the neurons phases .",
    "this reduced model , which is quite general and particularly interesting in its own right , will be the focus of the present work .    in  @xcite , a detailed numerical existence and stability analysis was done using xppaut  @xcite for a finite chain of coupled phase oscillators .",
    "certain interesting bifurcation phenomena were identified including saddle - node and pitchfork bifurcations in a two - dimensional parameter space characterizing the strength and asymmetry of coupling between nearest - neighbor oscillators . beyond the critical points involved in these bifurcations , direct numerical simulations identified traveling waves that are strongly reminiscent of the `` recruitment waves '' obtained in the original chain of forced neural oscillators .",
    "it is exactly these traveling waves that we systematically obtain and analyze in the present manuscript , by a combination of numerical and , whenever possible , semi - analytical techniques .",
    "specifically , we consider the exact traveling wave problem , which takes the form of an advance - delay differential ordinary equation in the co - traveling frame of such waves and which we introduce along with the mathematical formulation of the problem in section 2 . in section 3 , we proceed to solve this problem numerically , identifying exact ( up to numerical error ) traveling and standing ( zero - speed ) waves within the full two - dimensional parameter space used in  @xcite .",
    "we explore the stability of these waves in two complementary ways .",
    "on the one hand , we consider the traveling waves as steady states of the associated advance - delay partial differential equation ( pde ) . on the other hand , we examine them via direct numerical simulations of the original system of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the coupled oscillators with the initial condition `` distilled '' on the lattice from the obtained traveling wave solution . in  @xcite",
    ", this problem was studied in a limited range for the parameter @xmath1 measuring the asymmetry of the nearest - neighbor coupling function . here , our analysis extends to all values of @xmath1 .",
    "we show that traveling waves are stable in certain parameter regions that are periodic in @xmath1 and are located above a certain curve , below which there exist stable standing waves .",
    "the stability regions alternate along the direction of @xmath1 with regions where the waves are unstable due to the instability of the background state as well as a frontal instability .",
    "simulations of the lattice system initialized by an unstable traveling wave show that the frontal instability results in formation of two fronts that propagate in the opposite directions with the same speed as the initial wave .    in the final part of section 3 , we extend the lattice model to a two - dimensional setting and",
    "show that the planar fronts obtained from the one - dimensional traveling wave are very robust even with a local initial distortion , unlike radial fronts , which are eventually annihilated in the dynamical evolution .",
    "finally , we consider the evolution of two symmetric fronts with initially bulged centers and show that the resulting dynamics is in agreement with carpenter s findings , based on observations of phosphenes , that lines form loops instead of crossing through each other and that a line does not break apart unless it meets another line .",
    "this work adds support to the idea that a phase model may provide a useful framework for studying phosphenes and also raises interesting mathematical issues about the relation between advance - delay pde and lattice ode system solutions , and we conclude with a brief discussion of these points in section 4 .",
