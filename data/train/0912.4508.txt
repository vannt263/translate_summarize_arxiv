    "topological quantum computation ( tqc ) requires the existence of a 2d topologically ordered state whose lowest - energy excitations follow non - abelian statistics @xcite .",
    "if the appropriate many - body ground state wavefunction - e.g. , pfaffian states in fractional quantum hall systems @xcite and chiral @xmath0-wave ( @xmath7 ) superconductor / superfluid @xcite - is a linear combination of states from a degenerate subspace , then a pairwise exchange of the particle coordinates can unitarily rotate the wavefunction in the degenerate subspace .",
    "this exact non - abelian statistical property can be used to perform quantum gate operations , which are , in principle , fault - tolerant @xcite .",
    "more importantly , these non - abelian particles , the majorana fermions , being half - fermions , are new particles in nature distinct from ordinary dirac fermions , which are of obvious intrinsic fundamental interest @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "a key requirement for tqc is that the degenerate ground state subspace must be separated from the other excited states by a non - zero energy gap , so that thermal effects can not hybridize the topological quasiparticle states with the other higher - energy , non - topological , states in the system @xcite . in 2d @xmath7 superconductors ( sc ) , such as possibly @xmath8 , where the zero - energy majorana fermion excitations trapped in the vortex cores are the topological quasiparticle states , this gap is given by the so - called mini - gap , @xmath9 , where @xmath2 is the bulk superconducting gap and @xmath3 is the fermi energy @xcite . since @xmath10 mk is a very small energy scale for typical @xmath0-wave superconductors , the requirement @xmath11 constitutes the real bottle - neck for tqc , even if the best possible 2d @xmath7 superconductor - based platform were realized in the laboratory .",
    "here we show that , in a class of newly - proposed tqc platforms , involving majorana fermions in multilayer structures where @xmath5-wave superconductivity is proximity - induced on a host topological insulator ( ti ) @xcite or a spin - orbit - coupled semiconductor @xcite , the mini - gap can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "given that a strong proximity effect in such superconductor - semiconductor structures has already been experimentally demonstrated @xcite , it is realistic to decrease @xmath12 to satisfy @xmath13 , since @xmath14 can be made as high as 1 k ( i.e. a fraction of order unity of @xmath2 ) , which is the bulk gap in the @xmath5-wave superconductor .",
    "to derive these results , we explicitly analyze the microscopic model of the proximity effect between a ti surface and an @xmath5-wave superconductor by applying the conventional tunneling formalism @xcite .",
    "we find that , in addition to the superconducting gap @xmath2 , the interface transparency ( denoted by @xmath15 below ) given by the inter - layer tunneling amplitude controls the strength of the proximity effect on the ti surface .",
    "our main result is that for barriers with transparency satisfying @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fermi level on the ti surface , the excitation gap above the non - abelian quasiparticle states can be @xmath18 . we show this by applying our central result , eq .",
    "( 13 ) , on the excitation gaps in the two most important structures on a ti surface , a line junction ( eq .  ( 16 ) ) and a vortex ( eq .  ( 19 ) ) , which contain majorana modes .",
    "note that , as discussed earlier @xcite , the majorana modes in a line junction and a vortex are the two most essential elements of a putative tqc architecture on the ti surface .",
    "the dramatic increase of the excitation gap on the ti surface greatly enhances the robustness of the topological quasiparticles to thermal decoherence effects , which may bring non - abelian statistics and tqc to the realm of realistic , achievable , temperature regimes in the laboratory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the microscopic model we consider for the proximity effect at a ti - sc interface . in section iii , we derive the proximity induced effective pair potential with renormalized parameters . in sections",
    "iv and v we described the line - junction geometry that may be used to manipulate superconducting quasiparticles such as majorana fermions at a ti - sc interface . in section",
    "vi , we show that the mini - gap of a vortex formed at a ti - sc interface can be orders of magnitude larger than in a vortex in an intrinsic ( not proximity induced ) superconductor such as @xmath8 .",
    "an interesting property of superconductors is that they can induce superconductivity in a normal metal in contact with the superconductor.@xcite this is referred to as the superconducting proximity effect . as we will show in the rest of the text , the superconducting proximity effect allows a greater degree of control of the superconducting quasiparticle spectrum , than is possible by simply modifying the superconductor , where the superconductivity is intrinsically derived from the quasiparticle spectrum itself .",
    "the superconducting properties of a normal - superconductor ( ns ) interface can be described by the self - consistent bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations at the interface.@xcite    the bdg equations at an ns interface can be written in terms of a nambu spinor wave - function , @xmath19 which is finite on both the superconductor and normal side of the interface . in order to write these equations more compactly",
    "it is convenient to introduce the nambu matrices @xmath20 , which are identical to the pauli spin matrices @xmath21 , except that they operate on the @xmath22 part of the spinor @xmath23 .",

    "this follows from the self - consistency condition in the ti , @xmath60 since the attractive pairing interaction in the ti vanishes @xmath61 .",

    "note that since @xmath66 and @xmath67 are both zero on the ti side of the interface , the ratio can be finite which allows @xmath68 .",
    "however , even though there is no microscopic pair potential on the ti side , the superconducting proximity effect induces an _ effective _ superconducting pair potential . in the next few paragraphs",

    "since the anomalous part of the self - energy is proportional to the anomalous part of the green function , the complex phase of @xmath89 must also equal the complex phase of the superconductor .",

    "( [ vtilde ] ) gives the central results of this paper which can be understood as arising from the virtual propagation of the electron in the superconductor .",
    "this is consistent with the estimate of the fraction of time spent in the ti , which is @xmath123 , since we can estimate life - time of an electron in the ti as @xmath124 and the virtual excitation of an electron in the sc as @xmath125 .",
    "thus , in addition to inducing a pairing potential @xmath118 on the ti surface , the proximity effect also renormalizes the velocity on the surface of the ti to @xmath126 and the background potential to @xmath127 .",
    "one can notice that the ti electron density @xmath128 is proportional to @xmath129 and remains constant as expected . in the weak tunneling regime @xmath130 ,",
    "our tunneling matrix approach to the proximity effect is consistent with previous calculations @xcite for the superconductor - semiconductor system using the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk model @xcite .",
    "since the parameter @xmath15 is determined by purely electronic energy scales , @xmath15 can be larger than @xmath2 and the retardation effects discussed above lead to substantial renormalizations of the original parameters .",
    "the expression for the proximity - induced self - energy , eq .",
    "[ vtilde ] , was derived for a single superconducting island in contact with a ti surface .",
    "the proximity induced pairing was then localized to the region where @xmath131 was non - zero . in the case of different superconducting islands covering different parts of the ti surface , one must add the self - energy contribution from each of the separate islands . the pair - potential @xmath2 is then taken to be a constant for each island , but varies between different islands .",
    "in particular , a region of the ti which is in contact with a superconducting island ( through a non - zero @xmath131 ) inherits a superconducting pairing potential with a phase which has the same value as the island it is in contact with .",
    "futhermore the effective pair potential , vanishes ( since @xmath132 ) if the ti surface is not locally in contact with the superconductor ( for example the ti regions in between two superconducting islands has vanishing pair potential ) .",
    "below we will apply the formulae contained in eq .",
    "( [ vtilde ] ) to estimate the excitation gaps above the majorana topological excitations that have been discussed for the ti surface@xcite .",
    "the proximity effect discussed in the previous sections allows one to induce superconductivity on a semiconducting substrate such as a ti surface state .",
    "this leads to the possibility of manipulating the position and energies of superconducting quasiparticles on such a surface state .",
    "one of the most interesting scenarios that this kind of manipulation of superconducting quasiparticles might lead to is the possibility of creating and braiding majorana fermions at such ti / sc interfaces.@xcite    the trijunction geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trijunction ] provides a way to create and braid a majorana fermions on the ti surface : two tri - junctions ( a and b in fig .",
    "[ fig : trijunction ] ) of superconducting layers with distinct local phases separated by a line junction of length @xmath133 .",
    "the superconducting islands can be considered to have distinct phases for barrier transparencies much less than unity corresponding to @xmath134 .",
    "the line - junction separating the superconducting islands consists of a region of width @xmath135 which is not in direct contact with either of the superconducting islands . therefore the effective pairing potential vanishes in this region and in principle",
    "the line - junction can support multiple low energy transverse modes with energy much less than @xmath2 .",
    "this can be avoided by taking the junction width to satisfy @xmath136 such that the confinement energy @xmath137 creates a sufficiently large energy spacing between the various transverse modes . for the transparencies assumed in the paper @xmath138 , the width @xmath135 , which is required to be smaller than the effective coherence length is much smaller than the coherence length of the superconductor in the clean limit but much larger than the fermi wave - length of the superconductor .",
    "ideally , one should adjust the barrier transparency to set @xmath15 to the lowest value such that the line - junctions width @xmath135 is within the resolution of the fabrication technology .",
    "such a geometry can be used to trap zero - energy majorana fermions on the ti surface at discrete vortices formed by the phase configurations of the superconducting islands either at a or b. by varying the phase differences between the islands it is also possible to move the discrete vortex from a to b and thus transport the bound majorana state .",
    "the phase differences between neighboring superconducting islands is controlled by connecting the islands by superconducting loops with fluxes threaded through them .    .",
    "the values of the fluxes @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 which satisfy @xmath142 control the phases of the superconducting island .",
    "for the given superconducting phase configuration and @xmath143 the structure contains a vortex with a trapped majorana state only on tri - junction a. by changing @xmath144 to @xmath145 , the discrete vortex together with the majorana state is transferred to the tri - junction b. the majorana state is transported from a to b by the delocalized majorana fermion state formed on the @xmath146 line junction ( of length @xmath133 ) connecting a and b in the intermediate stage with @xmath147 . ]    for barrier transparencies between the ti and the sc , such that @xmath148 , but still much less than unity ( which implies @xmath149 ) , the josephson current between the islands mediated by the single channel ti surface state splits up into a small current density in the bulk - like superconducting loops .",
    "this adds only small gradients in phase to the gradient resulting from the vector potential of the magnetic flux .",
    "thus the difference in the phases on the islands are controlled by the applied fluxes according to the equation @xmath150 therefore , for the application of the fluxes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trijunction ] leads to the desired phase configuration on the islands .",
    "the tri - junction set - up discussed in the previous paragraphs operates on the principle that if one considers a single line - junction separating 2 superconductors ( such as the one joining a and b ) with a phase difference of @xmath151 , there are exactly 1 pair of 0 energy and 0 momentum majorana states trapped between the islands . at finite but small momenta , one can use lowest order @xmath152 perturbation theory to check that these modes disperse into a pair of linearly dispersing non - chiral majorana modes with equal and opposite velocities .",
    "off - setting the phase difference from @xmath151 by @xmath153 leads to a mass gap in the linear dirac spectrum of this pair of majorana modes .",
    "thus the effective hamiltonian describing such a line - junction is given by @xmath154 where @xmath155 here is an effective pseudo - spin degree of freedom that keeps track of the mode index.@xcite the term proportional to @xmath156 is an effective phase difference dependent mass term . following the jackiw - rebbi index theorem",
    "@xcite it is clear that a localized zero - energy solution results at any point where the sign of the mass @xmath157 changes sign . such changes in signs can be engineered at the ends @xmath158 and @xmath159 of the line - junction joining @xmath158 and @xmath159 by appropriately tuning the fluxes . as it turns out ,",
    "the appropriate mass changes are generated at the ends @xmath158 and @xmath159 whenever there are discrete vortices in the phases at @xmath158 and @xmath159.@xcite    with the configuration of the phases on the superconducting islands as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trijunction ] , and for @xmath160 , the total phase change around the tri - junction a is @xmath161 .",

    "since this argument applies to any system with weak superconductivity , it also holds for the ti / sc system as verified by our numerics .",
    "thus the staggering difference between the mini - gap estimate in a chiral p - wave superconductor @xmath206 mk and the estimate of @xmath207 k for the proximity induced system arises entirely from our ability to control the fermi energy @xmath3 in the system .",
    "lowering @xmath3 lowers @xmath208 which leads to a lower density of quasi - particle states at the fermi level which in turn reduces the number of mid - gap states in the vortex core .",
    "of course , our analysis of the mini - gap in proximity induced superconductors only accounts for possible quasiparticle states in the vortex core that were localized at the ti surface .",
    "therefore the geometry must ensure that there are no quasiparticles in the superconductor itself .",
