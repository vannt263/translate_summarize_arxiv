    "rational approximations of real or complex functions are used mainly in two kinds of applications .",
    "sometimes they provide compact representations of functions , much more efficient than polynomials for functions with poles or other singularities on or near the domain of approximation or on unbounded domains .",
    "other times , their role is one of extrapolation : the extraction of information about poles or values or other properties of a function in regions of the real line or complex plane beyond where it is known a priori .",
    "for example , standard methods of acceleration of convergence of sequences and series , such as the eta and epsilon algorithms , are based on rational approximations  @xcite . for a general discussion of the uses of rational approximation ,",
    "see chapter  23 of  @xcite , and for theoretical foundations , see  @xcite .    working with rational approximations , however , can be problematic .",
    "there are various challenges here , one of which particularly grabs attention : _ spurious poles , _ also known as _",
    "froissart doublets , _ which can be regarded either as poles with very small residues or as pole - zero pairs so close together as to nearly cancel  @xcite .",
    "froissart doublets arise in the fundamental mathematical problem  i.e. , in `` exact arithmetic ''  and are the reason why theorems on convergence of rational approximations , e.g.  of pad approximants along diagonals of the pad table , typically can not hold without the qualification of convergence in capacity rather than uniform convergence  @xcite . on a computer in floating point arithmetic ,",
    "they arise all the more often ; we speak of _ numerical froissart doublets , _",
    "recognizable by residues on the order of machine precision .",
    "these difficulties are related to the fact that the problem of analytic continuation , for which rational approximation is the most powerful general technique , is ill - posed .",
    "see chapter  26 of  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a _ aaa algorithm _ for rational approximation that offers a speed , flexibility , and robustness we have not seen in other algorithms ; the name stands for `` aggressive antoulas ",
    "anderson '' .",
    "the algorithm combines three ideas .",
    "first , following antoulas and anderson  @xcite ( though their presentation of the mathematics is very different ) , rational functions are represented in barycentric form with interpolation at certain support points selected from a set provided by the user .",
    "( related methods appear in  @xcite and  @xcite . )",
    "second , the algorithm grows the approximation degree one by one , selecting support points in a systematic greedy fashion so as to avoid exponential instabilities .",
    "third , the algebra is set in the mode of linearized least - squares fitting rather than just interpolation , further enhancing robustness and making it extensible to continuous as well as discrete domains .",
    "numerical froissart doublets usually do not appear , and if they do , they can be removed by one further solution of a least - squares problem .",
    "the barycentric formula takes the form of a quotient of two partial fractions , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an integer , @xmath2 are a set of real or complex distinct _ support points , _",
    "@xmath3 are a set of real or complex _ data values , _ and @xmath4 are a set of real or complex _ weights . _",
    "as indicated in the equation , we let @xmath5 and @xmath6 stand for the partial fractions in the numerator and the denominator . when we wish to be explicit about step numbers , we write @xmath7 .    the _ node polynomial _ @xmath8 associated with the set @xmath2 is the monic polynomial of degree @xmath9 with these numbers as roots , @xmath10 if we define @xmath11 then @xmath12 and @xmath13 are each polynomials of degree at most @xmath14 .",
    "thus we have a simple link between the barycentric representation of @xmath15 and its more familiar representation as a quotient of polynomials , @xmath16 this equation tells us that @xmath15 is a rational function of type @xmath17 , where , following standard terminology , we say that a rational function is of _ type @xmath18 _ for integers @xmath19 if it can be written as a quotient of a polynomial of degree at most  @xmath20 and a polynomial of degree at most @xmath21 , not necessarily in lowest terms . for any @xmath22 , but also of type @xmath23 for any @xmath24 . ] the numerator @xmath5 and denominator @xmath6 are each of type @xmath25 , so it is obvious from ( [ bary ] ) that  @xmath15 is of type @xmath26 ; it is the cancellation of the factors @xmath27 top and bottom that makes it actually of type @xmath17 .",
    "this is the paradox of the barycentric formula : it is of a smaller type than it looks , and its poles can be anywhere except where they appear to be .",
    "the paradox goes further in that , given any set of support points @xmath28 , there is a special choice of the weights @xmath29 for which  @xmath15 becomes a polynomial of degree @xmath14 .",
    "this is important in numerical computation , providing a numerically stable method for polynomial interpolation even in thousands of points ; see  @xcite for discussion and references .",
    "however , it is not our subject here .",
    "here we are concerned with the cases where ( [ bary ] ) is truly a rational function , a situation exploited perhaps first by salzer and then by schneider and werner  @xcite and most importantly in subsequent years by berrut and his collaborators  @xcite .",
    "a key aspect of ( [ bary ] ) is its interpolatory property . at each point @xmath30 with @xmath31 ,",
    "the formula is undefined , taking the form @xmath32 ( assuming @xmath33 ) .",
    "however , this is a removable singularity , for @xmath34 exists and is equal to @xmath35 .",
    "thus if the weights  @xmath36 are nonzero , ( [ bary ] ) provides a type @xmath17 _ rational interpolant _ to the data @xmath3 at @xmath2 .",
    "note that such a function has @xmath37 degrees of freedom , so roughly half of these are fixed by the interpolation conditions and the other half are not .",
    "we summarize the properties of barycentric representations developed in the discussion above by the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath38 be an arbitrary set of distinct complex numbers .",
    "as @xmath39 and @xmath40 range over all complex values , the functions described by the formula @xmath41 range over the set of all rational functions of type @xmath17 . if @xmath31 for some  @xmath42 , then @xmath43 .",
    "if the support points @xmath28 have no influence on the set of functions described by ( [ baryagain ] ) , one may wonder , what is the use of barycentric representations ?",
    "the answer is all about numerical quality of the representation .",
    "the barycentric formula is composed from quotients @xmath44 , and for good choices of @xmath45 , these functions are independent enough to make the representation well - conditioned  often far better conditioned , in particular , then one would find with a representation @xmath46 .",
    "the use of localized and sometimes singular basis functions is an established theme in other areas of scientific computing .",
    "_ radial basis functions , _ for example , have excellent conditioning properties when they are composed of pieces that are well separated  @xcite .",
    "similarly the _ method of fundamental solutions , _ which has had great success in solving elliptic pdes such as helmholtz problems , represents its functions as linear combinations of hankel or other functions each localized at a singular point  @xcite .",
    "an aim of the present paper is to bring this kind of thinking to the subject of function theory .",
    "yet another related technique in scientific computing is _ discretizations of the cauchy integral formula , _ for example by the trapezoidal rule on the unit circle , to evaluate analytic functions inside a curve .",
    "the basis functions implicit in such a discretization are singular , introducing poles and hence errors of size @xmath47 at precisely the data points where one might expect the errors to be @xmath48 , but still the approximation may be excellent away from the curve  @xcite .",
    "we begin with a finite _ sample set _ @xmath49 of @xmath50 points .",
    "we assume a function @xmath51 is given that is defined at least for @xmath52 .",
    "this function may have an analytic expression , or it may be just a set of data values .",
    "the aaa algorithm takes the form of an iteration for @xmath53 with @xmath15 represented at each step in the barycentric form ( [ baryagain ] ) . at step @xmath9",
    "we first pick the next support point @xmath54 , and then we compute corresponding weights @xmath55 by solving a linear least - squares problem over the subset of sample points that have not been selected as support points , @xmath56 thus at step @xmath9 , we compute a rational function @xmath15 of type @xmath17 , which generically will interpolate @xmath57 at @xmath2 ( though not always , since one or more weights may turn out to be zero ) .",
    "the least - squares aspect of the algorithm is as follows .",
    "our aim is an approximation @xmath58 which in linearized form becomes @xmath59 note that in going from ( [ oldfit ] ) to ( [ newfit ] ) we have replaced @xmath60 by @xmath61 , because @xmath5 and @xmath6 will generically have poles at @xmath2 , so ( [ newfit ] ) would not make sense over all @xmath52 .",
    "the weights @xmath55 are chosen to solve the least - squares problem @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the discrete 2-norm over @xmath61 and @xmath64 is the discrete 2-norm on @xmath9-vectors . to ensure that this problem makes sense , we assume that @xmath61 has at least @xmath9 points , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "the greedy aspect of the iteration is as follows . at step @xmath9 , the next support point @xmath54 is chosen as a point @xmath66 where the nonlinear residual @xmath67 at step @xmath14 takes its maximum absolute value .",
    "assuming the iteration is successful , it terminates when the nonlinear residual is sufficiently small ; we have found it effective to use a tolerance of @xmath68 relative to the maximum of @xmath69 .",
    "the resulting approximation typically has few or no numerical froissart doublets , and if there are any , they can generally be removed by one further least - squares step to be described in section  [ removing ] .",
    "( if the convergence tolerance is too tight , the approximation will stagnate and many froissart doublets will appear . ) in the core aaa algorithm it is an approximation of type @xmath17 .",
    "it remains to spell out the linear algebra involved in ( [ l2prob ] ) .",
    "let us regard @xmath61 and @xmath70 as column vectors , @xmath71 we seek a normalized column vector @xmath72 that minimizes the 2-norm of the @xmath73-vector @xmath74 that is , @xmath75 this is a matrix problem of the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the @xmath78 _ lwner matrix _",
    "@xcite @xmath79 we will solve ( [ minprob ] ) using the singular value decomposition ( svd ) , taking @xmath80 as the final right singular vector in a reduced svd @xmath81 . along",
    "the way it is convenient to make use of the @xmath78 _ cauchy matrix _ @xmath82 whose columns define the basis in which we approximate .",
    "if we define diagonal left and right scaling matrices by @xmath83 then we can construct @xmath77 from @xmath84 using the identity @xmath85 and once @xmath80 is found with the svd , we can compute @xmath73-vectors @xmath86 and @xmath87 with @xmath88 these correspond to the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 at points @xmath89 .",
    "( since @xmath90 will generally be large , it is important that the sparsity of @xmath91 is exploited in the multiplication of ( [ afromc ] ) . ) finally , to get an @xmath90-vector @xmath92 corresponding to @xmath93 for all @xmath52 , we set @xmath94 and then @xmath95 .",
    "after the aaa algorithm terminates ( assuming @xmath31 for all @xmath42 ) , one has a rational approximation @xmath96 in barycentric form . the zeros of @xmath97 , which are ( generically ) the poles of  @xmath15 , can be computed by solving an @xmath98 generalized eigenvalue problem in arrowhead form  ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.3.3 ) , @xmath99 at least two of the eigenvalues of this problem are infinite , and the remaining @xmath14 are the zeros of @xmath97 .",
    "a similar computation with @xmath36 replaced by @xmath100 gives the zeros of @xmath5 .",
    "the following proposition collects some elementary properties of the core aaa algorithm .",
    "we say `` a '' instead of `` the '' in view of the fact that in cases of ties in the greedy choice at each step , aaa approximants are not unique .",
    "[ prop ] let @xmath93 be a aaa approximant at step @xmath9 of a function @xmath51 on a set @xmath60 ( computed in exact arithmetic ) .",

    "_ monotonicity . _ the linearized residual norm @xmath111 is a nonincreasing function of  @xmath9 .",
    "these properties are straightforward and we do not spell out the arguments except to note that the monotonicity property follows from the fact that @xmath77 is obtained from @xmath112 by deleting one row and appending one column . since the minimum singular vector for @xmath112 ( padded with one more zero ) is also a candidate singular vector of @xmath77 , we must have @xmath113 .    one might ask , must the monotonicity be strict , with @xmath114 if @xmath115 ?",
    "so far as we are aware , the answer is no .",
    "an equality @xmath116 implies @xmath117 , where @xmath54 is the support point selected at step @xmath9 .",
    "this in turn implies @xmath118 , since otherwise we could divide by @xmath119 to find @xmath120 , which would contradict the greedy choice of @xmath54 .",
    "but so far as we know , the possibility @xmath121 is not excluded .",
    "since the aaa algorithm involves svds of dimensions @xmath122 with @xmath123 its complexity is @xmath124 flops .",
    "this is usually modest since in most applications @xmath9 is small .",
    "the matlab code aaa.m , shown in figure  [ codefig ] and available in chebfun  @xcite , is intended to be readable as well as computationally useful and makes the aaa algorithm fully precise .",
    "the code closely follows the algorithm description above , differing in just one detail for programming convenience : instead of working with a subset @xmath61 of size @xmath125 of @xmath60 , we use an index vector @xmath126 that is a subset of size @xmath125 of @xmath127 .",

    "the setting in  @xcite is interpolatory , so weighting of rows is not an issue except perhaps for numerical stability , but such a modification for us would require a decision about how to weight derivative conditions relative to others .",

    "if the aaa algorithm seems very different from other methods for rational approximation that have been proposed , that is not because it is very advanced , but only because rational barycentric representations have been so little explored .",
    "we note that the algorithm makes use of both a linearized residual ( for speed of solving a least - squares problem ) and a nonlinear one ( the measure of ultimate interest in approximation ) , and further improvements may be achieved by coupling the linear and nonlinear parts together more closely .",
    "we finish with one more example .",
    "the following matlab sequence evaluates the riemann zeta function at 100 points on the complex line segment from @xmath338 to @xmath339 , constructs a aaa approximant @xmath15 of type @xmath340 , and evaluates its poles and zeros .",
    "this requires a bit less than a second on our desktop computer :    ....    zeta = @(z ) sum(bsxfun(@power,(1e5:-1:1)',-z ) ) [ r , pol , res , zer ] = aaa(linspace(4 - 40i,4 + 40i),zeta ) ....    the approximation has a pole at @xmath341 with residue @xmath342 and a zero at @xmath343 .",
    "these results match numbers for @xmath344 in each case in all digits but the last two .",
    "we thank anthony austin , silviu filip , and stefan gttel for advice at many stages of this project .",
    "it was gttel who pointed us to ( [ elliptic ] ) ."
