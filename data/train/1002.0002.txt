    "stars of different stellar generations are currently routinely found in all galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "a common misunderstanding is to identify _ multiple sequences _ in the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) as the _ only _ evidence of _ multiple stellar populations _ in gcs , while they are only the tip of the iceberg , observable when differences in chemical composition and/or age are very large .",
    "however , all gcs display large spreads in abundances of light elements .",
    "these are due to the presence of two generations of stars , separated by a small difference in age , not enough to appear as a smearing of the cluster turn - off , but clearly visible as a different chemical signature .",
    "this difference can be uncovered by spectroscopy ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . since its discovery by the lick - texas group ( see the early review by @xcite ) , the na - o anticorrelation in gcs offers a powerful instrument to resolve age differences as small as a few 10@xmath5 yrs ( should very massive stars be involved ) by means of a signal as large as 1 full dex in abundance .",
    "_ whenever the na - o anticorrelation is observed in a gc , multiple stellar generations are present in the cluster_.    the primordial p component of first generation stars , present in almost all galactic gcs surveyed so far , has the high [ o / fe ] and low [ na / fe ] ratios typical of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ii ) nucleosynthesis , characteristic of halo field stars with similar metallicity . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite showed that two other components of second generation stars may be found : one dominant component has intermediate composition ( i ; observed in @xmath6 gc ) , and another has extremely ( e ) modified composition , showing large o - depletion and na ( and al ) enhancements , present only in the most massive clusters .",
    "this general pattern can be qualitatively produced by proton - capture reactions in h - burning at high temperature ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the same na - o and mg - al anticorrelations are found in unevolved stars in several gcs ( @xcite ) tells us that this composition is inherited from the ashes of a previous generation of stars .",
    "while the involved processes have been largely identified , it is still not clear _ where _ these reactions occurred , the favorite sites being either main - sequence core h - burning of fast rotating massive stars ( frms , @xcite ) or the hot bottom of the convective envelope in intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars @xcite .",
    "whichever the sites are , they can not synthesize iron or other elements heavier than al .",
    "indeed , apart from a few notable exceptions ( @xmath4  cen , see reference in @xcite ; m  22 , @xcite ; m  54 , @xcite ; terzan  5 , @xcite ; and possibly ngc  1851 , @xcite ) the level in [ fe / h ] or @xmath7 and fe - group elements is very constant in gcs @xcite .",
    "however , a recent work by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* from now l09 ) seems to challenge this consolidated scenario , because in their ca-@xmath8 survey they found a spread in the photometric @xmath2 index ( including ca ii h and k lines ) for several gcs .",
    "they interpret this spread as due to ca abundance variations and claim that this @xmath9element was produced by sn ii in a past phase of the lifetime of gcs . in turn , these should be assumed to be initially much more massive than at present , else the highly energetic sne winds would have been lost from the potential well .",
    "moreover , they find that the ca - strong group in gcs with evidence of multiple stellar populations from spectroscopy is associated to the population of stars with lower o and higher na values , and vice versa concerning the ca - weak stars .",
    "the need of massive proto - clusters is common to most scenarios of chemical evolution of gcs , including one proposed by us @xcite . however",
    "a correlation between ca and light elements would imply that the second generation stars were formed from material enriched not only by frms or agb stars , but also by sn ii events , which is a substantial modification of the current scenario .",
    "in the present letter we exploit the large wealth of data from our ongoing project  na - o anticorrelation and hb \" @xcite and from other extensive spectroscopic surveys to compare [ ca / h ] ratios obtained from high resolution spectroscopy with the abundance distribution of o , na , al in a sample of several hundred red giant branch ( rgb ) stars in 17 gcs .",
    "this allows to shed light on the rle of ca in the chemical evolution of gcs ; from our extensive spectroscopic database , we seek to confirm whether the spread in the photometric @xmath2 index is driven by a real spread in ca abundance .",
    "the full description of the analysis is given in @xcite ; here we present only the abundances of ca , which are based on a large number of lines ( typically 10 - 12 in the most metal - poor clusters like m  15 and almost 20 in metal - rich gcs like 47  tuc ) .",
    "the [ ca / fe ] ratios with the number of lines and the line - to - line r.m.s .",
    "scatter for each star are listed in table [ cah ] ( completely available on line only ) . in table 2",
    "we report the number of stars in each cluster , the average [ ca / fe ] and [ ca / h ] values and the 1  @xmath10 scatter of the mean .",
    "the rms scatters in [ ca / fe ] are smaller than in [ ca / h ] because the sensitivity of ca and fe lines to atmospheric parameters is quite similar .",
    "five of the clusters listed in table 1 are included in the sample by l09 , who claim significant spread in ca for four of them .",
    "the values listed in table  2 indicate that the mean level of ca is highly homogeneous in each gcs .",
    "the average r.m.s .",
    "star - to - star scatter for [ ca / fe ] is 0.03  dex from 17 gcs , to be compared with average scatter of 0.18 dex , 0.22 dex , 0.07 dex and 0.25 dex for o , na , mg , and al respectively .",
    "note that the mean scatter in mg , produced by core collapse sne but also involved in proton - capture reactions , is more than _ twice _ that of ca , which does not participate in any h - burning .",
    "since we have only about 10 stars per cluster observed with uves , we combined the 17 gcs , separating first generation ( p ) stars from second generation ( i+e ) stars . for direct comparison with l09 , we used [ ca / h ] instead of [ ca / fe ] , after normalizing the individual values to the mean of each cluster . in figure 1",
    "we show the histogram in [ ca / h ] for p and i+e stars , with average values , errors , and rms .",
    "about two thirds of stars belong to the second generation , and the average normalized [ ca / h ] values do not differ from those of first generation ( at about 1@xmath10 ) .",
    "a further check comes from the cumulative distributions , shown in figure 2 ( upper panel ) , from which we excluded the 12 stars of ngc  2808 , the gc in our sample showing the most extreme variations in he ( @xcite , and below in this letter ) .",
    "the two distributions can not be distinguished .",
    "note that if we include also ngc  2808 , the probability of the kolmogorov - smirnov drops to 0.07 , still compatible with no significant difference , but possibly indicating some actual variations in this particular cluster .",
    "however , when we show in the three lower panels of figure 2 the cumulative distributions for [ o / fe ] , [ na / fe ] , and [ al / fe ] , all elements involved in the ( anti)correlations in gcs , we clearly see a striking difference ( compare e.g. to supplementary fig.14 of l09 ) .",
    "our sample of 200 stars comes from 17 different gcs , but there is already available in literature a sample of similar size for a single gc , m  4 , for which @xcite analyzed high resolution uves spectra of 105 rgb stars .",
    "this cluster is also in the l09 sample ; from their supplementary fig.14 ( panel i ) we see that almost all stars defined ca - strong are na - rich ( in our interpretation , second generation i , e ) and vice versa for the ca - weak . however , when we divide the stars in the marino et al . sample in p and i+e ( using their same separation at [ na / fe]=0.2 ) and compare the histograms and the means of the two populations ( see figure 3 , left panel ) , they look very similar .",
    "this is supported by the cumulative distributions ( figure 3 , right panel ) : they are indistinguishable , according to the ks test .",
    "a further check was done considering only stars in the two extreme quartiles in na abundance : the average ca values in the more na - poor and in the more na - rich stars perfectly agree with the ones in figure 3 for the i+e and p stars , respectively .    _",
    "the stars called ca - weak ( ca - strong ) on the basis of their @xmath2  index do not seem to have lower ( higher ) [ ca / h ] values from direct analysis of high resolution spectra ; this demonstrates that the differences in the @xmath2  index must be produced by something other than ca variations . _",
    "it is important to stress that the observational effect at the basis of the l09 claim corresponds to 1@xmath10 spreads in [ ca / h ] of about 0.03 dex in the most extreme cases ( ngc  1851 , ngc  2808 , excluding the special cases of @xmath4 cen and m  22 where the presence of a significant spread in iron has already been established with high resolution spectroscopy ) and of about 0.02 dex for typical cases ( like m  4 , m  5 , and ngc  6752 , see table 2 ) assuming a gaussian distribution , and further converted to scatter in [ ca / h ] and [ fe / h ] using the sensitivity of ca on the variation in @xmath2 ( suppl . sect .",
    "4 ) and the relations in sect .",
    "3 . ] . in our view",
    ", these numbers call for two basic considerations :    1 .",
    "such tiny spreads are similar in amplitude to several uncertainties that are known to affect the abundance analysis ( like e , g , variations in the he content ) ; they are usually neglected since the overall uncertainty on single measures is typically larger than this .",
    "we do not exclude that there might be dispersions at these very low levels , but presently they can not be separated from the intrinsic errors .",
    "2 .   even if we regard these very small variations as _",
    "real _ , some basic algebra indicates that , assuming a mass of @xmath11 and a metallicity of @xmath12 for the gas cloud that gave origin to the cluster , a single sn ii event would be sufficient to produce the required amount of ca ( and fe ) .",
    "if the tiny variations detected in most gcs are not measuring intrinsic scatter in ca , what might be the cause for the variations in the @xmath2 index ?",
    "l09 discussed several issues to show that the only way to affect the @xmath2 index is a change in ca .",
    "specifically , they made a strong case for ngc  1851 , where the few  ca - strong \" stars ( with abundances from high resolution spectroscopy by @xcite are segregated to the reddest positions in the @xmath3 cmd . in a recent paper , @xcite presented a split of the rgb in this cluster in the @xmath13 plane , where the redder sequence is populated by ca - strong stars .",
    "we simply note the striking similarity between the cmd by han et al . with the @xmath14 cmd for m  4 by @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the rgb is clearly split into two distinct sequences .",
    "however , the same dichotomy of rgb sequences in m  4 is explained by @xcite as the n enhancement affecting the @xmath15 colors ( through the cn and nh molecular bands within the @xmath1 filter ) , so that na - rich ( and likely n rich ) stars are separated from na - poor ( and n - poor ) stars in the cmds . since we demonstrated in figure  3 that in m  4 the [ ca / h ] ratio is identical for the na - poor and na - rich stars , the same conclusion might be valid for ngc  1851 .",
    "a further piece of the puzzle comes from @xcite , who confirmed results by @xcite in ngc  6752 : na - poor stars define a narrow n - poor sequence all confined to the bluest part of the rgb in ngc  6752 , whereas the na - rich ( n - enhanced ) stars are spread out to the red part of the rgb , reaching large n abundances .",
    "now , regardless of the nature of the polluters , the ejected matter is always enriched in the main outcome of h - burning , he .",
    "* in preparation ) used a large sample ( about 1400 rgb stars in 19 gcs ) to show that stars with higher he content should have on average slightly larger [ fe / h ] values the difference between the e and p stars being 0.027 dex in [ fe / h ] , even if there is no difference in the overall metal content z.    these findings suggest that the correlation observed by l09 between the ( small ) dispersion in [ ca / h ] and the ( large ) spread in @xmath2 may be related to variations in he and light elements only , with no fresh production of fe and ca .",
    "the sizable effect on the kolmogorov - smirnov test of the inclusion of ngc  2808 in the sample ( sect .",
    "3 ) lends further support to this scenario , as this cluster seems to display especially large variations in he abundance @xcite .",
    "hence , while it is quite possible that in ngc  1851 some small intrinsic scatter in iron does actually exist @xcite , our results do not support the idea that core collapse sne contributed to the enrichment of second generation stars in most gcs , and indicate that the production of the proton - capture elements occurred in sites not able to synthesize ca and fe - peak elements .",
    "lee and coworkers devised a scenario for chemical enrichment in clusters with multiple populations .",
    "it includes two - phases .",
    "first , core collapse sne from first generation stars inject in the intra - cluster medium material enriched with fe and @xmath9elements ; at least part of this material is not lost by the gcs owing to their larger mass at early epochs .",
    "second generation stars form from this enriched material , incorporating the ejecta of intermediate - mass agb stars with longer evolutionary times .",
    "the second generation stars are then produced from matter enriched both in heavy and light elements .",
    "* since there is clear evidence of multiple populations from spectroscopy in _ all _ gcs , except perhaps a few small ones with only a handful of stars analyzed ( e.g. pal 12 , @xcite ; ter  7 , @xcite ; both belonging to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ) , any proposed scenario must account for the formation of the generality of gcs . *",
    "while a single core collapse sn might be enough to produce the claimed scatter in [ ca / h ] , thousands ( or even more ) frms or massive agb stars are required to produce the observed pattern for elements involved in proton - capture processes .",
    "the impact of these two mechanisms can not be the same .",
    "* core collapse sne should produce a ( variable ) enhancement in the mean abundances for other @xmath9elements .",
    "no significant variation has been observed for mg and si ( apart from those explained by the mg - al cycle ; see fig . 3 in @xcite ) , or ti @xcite .",
    "* in gcs like m  4 , a split in @xmath2 of 45@xmath16 ( measurement errors for the populations , l09 , supplementary fig .",
    "10 ) between two populations translates in virtually no difference in the [ ca / h ] ratios obtained from a homogeneous large sample of stars with high resolution spectra . * if frms are the polluters , the whole model would fail , since these stars release the polluted matter in very short time , while still in ms .",
    "hence , the timescale is even shorter than that for production of core collapse sne . * the model by l09 , adapted to explain the double rgb seen in ngc  1851 , results in a number ratio of first - to second generation stars equal to 3 ( 75%/25% ) . from spectroscopy",
    ", on the other hand , it was found that the bulk of stars in gcs belong to the second generation @xcite , with a number ratio typically of about 0.5 ( 0.33/0.66 ) .",
    "we stress that this feature is @xmath17 a prerogative of mono - metallic gcs , the same value for the primordial fraction is also found in @xmath4 cen and m  54 @xcite , the two most massive clusters in the galaxy , both showing actual ( large ) dispersion in [ fe / h ] : this finding demonstrates that the relative fractions of first and second generation stars are not related to the enrichment of heavy elements .",
    "* the @xmath18process element europium , whose main production site is expected to be core - collapse sne , is fairly constant within all the studied globular clusters @xcite .",
    "* finally , one of the strongest objection to the l09 model comes from the run of al . with its yield extremely dependent on the neutron excess ( metallicity ) , any variations in the content of fe ( or heavy element produced in sn ii , like ca ) should be accompanied by clear changes in the primordial al abundance . as shown by @xcite",
    "this is not always seen , in particular in clusters like m  4 where a bimodal distribution is claimed in the @xmath2 distribution .",
    "the al distribution is far from being bimodal in m  4 , on the contrary [ al / fe ] is quite constant and does not vary between first and second generation stars .",
    "this is clearly seen also in other gcs like ngc  6171 , ngc  288 , and ngc  6838 from our own data @xcite as well in the larger sample by @xcite .",
    "this constancy , due to the secondary ( metallicity - dependent ) production of al in sne strongly precludes that any significant difference in heavy metal - content is provided by sne to stars in different stellar generations in gcs .",
    "we conclude that ( i ) the spreads in [ ca / h ] are very small ; ( ii ) different distributions in o , na , al are clearly seen between first and second generation stars in @xmath19 gcs analyzed so far , on the contrary no statistically significant difference is found regarding ca abundances from high resolution spectroscopy ; ( iii ) the small difference in ca observed in some cases might be well explained with systematic second - order effects due to the fact that second generation stars are he - enhanced , and appear more metal - rich and hotter when analyzed with high resolution spectroscopy .",
