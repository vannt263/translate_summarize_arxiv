    "the nature of the @xmath0 resonance is an important issue particularly to understand @xmath5-nucleus interactions .",
    "being located just below the threshold of @xmath1 , the @xmath0 is a key resonance for the study of subthreshold kaons in nuclei . due to the decay of the @xmath0 to @xmath6 , for the structure of the @xmath0 , both @xmath6 and @xmath1 dynamics are essential .",
    "the @xmath0 has been a historical example of a dynamically generated resonance in meson - baryon coupled - channels dynamics with @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "modern treatments based on chiral dynamics with a unitary framework , reproduce well the observed spectrum of the @xmath0 together with cross sections of @xmath8 to various channels  @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the chiral perturbation theory of an effective theory of qcd at low energies giving fundamental interaction of meson and baryon , and scattering theory , such as the @xmath9 method , to guarantee unitarity on the scattering amplitudes .",
    "analyticity of the scattering amplitude is also essentially important to obtain subthreshold amplitudes and to investigate resonance properties in the complex energy plane .",
    "the obtained amplitude reproduces the meson - baryon scattering well and provides @xmath0 as a dynamically generated resonance in @xmath10-wave meson - baryon scattering .    on the success of the theoretical description of the @xmath0 ,",
    "it it worth noting the following facts ; 1 ) the available experimental data to constrain theoretical descriptions of the scattering amplitude with @xmath7 around the @xmath0 energies are the @xmath1 scattering and kaonic hydrogen data .",
    "thus , the present theoretical description lacks experimental information of @xmath11 , which may be important to study @xmath5 in few - body nuclear systems .",
    "2 ) the famous @xmath0 spectrum given in ref .",
    "@xcite is a @xmath12 invariant mass observed in the @xmath13 decay .",
    "therefore , the initial channel to produce @xmath0 is not clear . as seen below ,",
    "since the @xmath0 spectrum shape depends on the production channel , it is extremely important to control the initial channel experimentally and to investigate the production mechanism theoretically for the good understanding of the nature of @xmath0 .",
    "in this section , we explain the findings about the nature of @xmath0 obtained by the chiral unitary approach .      resonances are expressed as poles of the scattering amplitude in the complex energy plane . in the chiral unitary approach for the meson - baryon system developed by ref .",
    "@xcite , the scattering amplitude is obtained in an analytic form , so that one can easily perform analytic continuation of the scattering amplitude to the complex energy plane . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the @xmath0 seen in the @xmath6 invariant mass spectra consists of two resonance poles located at the @xmath0 energies , and these two state have different coupling properties to the meson - baryon states ; one is located at @xmath14 mev ( pole 1 ) with a larger width having strong coupling to the @xmath6 state , ant the other pole is at higher energy @xmath15 ( pole 2 ) mev with a narrower width and dominantly couples to the @xmath1 state . because these two states closely appear with the large widths , one can not observe these states separately in the @xmath6 invariant mass spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : msi0](b ) ) .",
    "what we can see is a single peak structure provided by the interference of these two states , that is the @xmath0 spectrum observed in experiments .",
    "the reason that there exist two poles around the @xmath0 energies is that there are two attractive channels with @xmath7 and @xmath16 in @xmath10-wave at these energies  @xcite , @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "these two attractive channels provide the two resonance states .",
    "it is also found in a recent work  @xcite that the @xmath0 can be described essentially by two coupled channels of @xmath1 and @xmath2 rather than a complete su(3 ) configuration by four channels , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , without the channel couplings between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one has a bound state in the @xmath1 channel below the @xmath19 threshold and a resonance in the @xmath6 channel above the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "these two states appear very close to the original states obtained in coupled channels .",
    "therefore , the essential ingredients of @xmath0 is the @xmath1 bound state and @xmath6 resonant correlation .",
    "this is the reason for the double pole structure of @xmath0 and the different coupling nature of the two states .",
    "the presence of the two poles having different coupling properties results in initial channel dependence of the @xmath0 peak position in the @xmath2 invariant spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : msi0](a ) , we show the @xmath6 invariant mass spectra with @xmath16 initiated by two different channels , @xmath1 and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the figure shows that the @xmath0 peak is seen in the different energies ; for the @xmath6 initiated spectrum , the resonance peak appears at around 1405 mev , whereas in the @xmath20 channel , the peak position is located higher at around 1420 mev instead of 1405 mev .",
    "this is because , for the @xmath2 channel , both of the lower and higher poles contribute to the spectrum , while the @xmath1 system selectively couples to the higher pole , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : msi0](b ) and  [ fig : msi0](c ) , where we show decomposition of the @xmath0 spectrum into each pole contribution .",
    "the decomposition is performed by the model calculation in which the amplitudes are given by breit - wigner terms for pole 1 and 2 together with the resonance parameters , such as mass , width and couplings , determined by the chiral unitary model  @xcite . in this way , the resonance position in the @xmath6 invariant mass depends on the channels to produce the @xmath0 . particularly , the finding that the @xmath0 resonance appears at 1420 mev in the @xmath1 initiated channel is important for kaon - nucleus systems , since the resonance appearing in the @xmath1 channel is the one relevant for the kaon - nucleon interaction .",

    "the dashed ( dotted ) line denotes the spectrum only with pole 1 ( pole 2 ) term , while the solid line shows the spectrum calculated by coherent sum of pole 1 and 2 .",
    "the breit - wigner parameters are determined by the chiral unitary model . for the details , see ref .",
    "[ fig : msi0],width=510 ]    one of the experimental confirmation of the double pole nature of the @xmath0 is to compare the @xmath0 spectra in different channels .",
    "especially , as we already discussed above , one of the important consequences is that the resonance in the spectrum initiated by the @xmath1 channel appears at 1420 mev .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to see the resonance position in the @xmath0 production initiated by @xmath1 .",
    "however , direct production @xmath23 is kinematically forbidden , since the @xmath0 resonance appears below the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "this fact leads us to indirect productions of @xmath0 .",
    "but , in the indirect production , it is necessary to investigate the @xmath0 production mechanism theoretically to recognize the initial channels of the @xmath0 production .       reaction .",

    "thus , it is important noting that , in this reaction , the @xmath0 is produced selectively by the @xmath1 channel .",
    "this is because the strangeness is brought into the system by the initial kaon .",

    "diagrams 2 and 3 are for two - step processes with @xmath5 exchange . for the energetic incident @xmath28 with several hundreds mev / c momentum in the lab .",
    "frame , the contribution of diagram 1 ( direct production ) is expected to be very small , since the @xmath0 is produced by a far off - shell nucleon and the deuteron wavefunction has tiny component of such a nucleon .",
    "in contrast to the direct production , in the double scattering diagrams , the large energy of the incident @xmath28 is carried away by the final neutron and the exchanged kaon can have a suitable energy to create the @xmath0 colliding with the other nucleon in the deuteron .",
    "double scattering diagrams with pion exchanges hardly contribute to the @xmath0 production , since @xmath30 and @xmath31 are emitted separately from the @xmath24 and @xmath25 amplitudes .",

    "it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the position of the higher pole has less model dependence among different calculations based on coupled - channels approach with chiral dynamics , while these calculations predict different positions for the lower pole which couples to @xmath2 strongly ( see fig .  8 in ref .",
    "this is because , in these model calculations , @xmath8 scattering data are used to fix the model parameters and the properties of the @xmath1 interaction are well constrained by exciting data .",
    "it was also pointed out in a different approach  @xcite that a pole appears at around 1420 mev in the @xmath1 scattering amplitude which reproduces the @xmath40 scattering lengths .",
    "contrarily , we have few data available for @xmath41 scattering so far .",
    "the lack of the @xmath2 scattering data makes the properties of the lower pole less controlled in theoretical calculations .",

    "@xmath43 denotes the pole position of the lower resonance .",
    "the right row shows the value of the @xmath2 scattering length calculated under the assumption that there is a virtual state around 10 mev below the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "[ tab : pisigma ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a more interesting question is whether the pole in the @xmath6 is really a resonance or not .",
    "the chiral unitary approach predicts that the @xmath6 strong correlation forms a resonance state found above the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "yet we do not have the experimental confirmation of the @xmath2 resonance pole .",
    "if the @xmath6 interaction were unexpectedly strong enough , there could exist a @xmath6 virtual state below the @xmath6 threshold in stead of the resonance state . in this case , the @xmath0 would be consisted of one single pole .",
    "alternatively , for the @xmath10-wave interaction , energy - independent potentials can provide only virtual states .",
    "thus , in case that the energy - dependence of the @xmath2 interaction would be weak in the @xmath2 threshold energies , the @xmath6 attraction could provide a virtual state .",
    "this sort of meson - baryon amplitude is studied in ref .",
    "the question of either resonance or virtual state in the @xmath2 correlation can be answered by the magnitude of the @xmath6 scattering length .",
    "if the virtual state exists close to the threshold , the scattering length is in order of 5 fm , while , as we already saw , for the resonance case , the scattering length is around 0.5 fm , which is one order of magnitude small .    understanding the @xmath44 scattering properties is important not only for the @xmath0 structure but also for @xmath5 in few - body systems , such as @xmath45  @xcite . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath46 system , if @xmath5 few - body states are weakly bound , the @xmath5 and nucleons are the essential constituents , and @xmath31 and @xmath30 can be regarded as nonactive degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the coupled channels effect of @xmath6 can be incorporated into the effective @xmath1 interaction as done in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the few - body bound state is essentially obtained in the single channel problem .",
    "however , since the @xmath2 threshold is located 100 mev below the threshold of the @xmath1 , if the @xmath5 few - body systems turn out to be bound with a large binding energy , inclusion of the @xmath2 coupled channel effect to theoretical calculations are unavoidable  @xcite , and there in - vacuum @xmath44 scattering data are necessary as a fundamental input .",
    "the third consequence of the chiral unitary model is that @xmath0 is almost purely a quasibound state of the meson and baryon , and quark components are much less important .",
    "a recent analysis  @xcite have shown that , although in the chiral unitary approach only the dynamics of meson and baryon is considered , the formulation implicitly involves some other components than the meson and baryon considered in the model space of the framework .",
    "the work  @xcite also discussed how to exclude the implicit components in theoretical description of scattering amplitudes , and compared the pole positions of the @xmath0 in the theoretical amplitude with those of the scattering amplitude obtained phenomenologically so as to reproduce the observed @xmath1 scattering .",
    "they find that these two descriptions provide very similar pole positions of @xmath0 and conclude that the @xmath0 is predominantly described by the meson - baryon component .",
    "owing to the meson - baryon quasibound structure , the @xmath0 has a different nature than typical baryon resonances which may have largely three - quark components .",
    "for instance , as a theoretical analysis , the behavior with the number of colors ( @xmath47 ) of the @xmath0 has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it has been found that the @xmath47 behavior of the decay widths is different from the general counting rule for a @xmath48 state .",
    "another example is the size of the @xmath0 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the electromagnetic mean squared radii of the @xmath0 were calculated .",
    "they found that the electric radius of the @xmath0 is about three times larger than that of the neutron .",
    "this is a consequence of the small binding energy ( @xmath49 mev ) , in which the constituent kaon in the @xmath0 is an almost real particle surrounding around the nucleon .",
    "the @xmath0 can be an building - block of @xmath5 nuclear few - body systems , since one of the pole in the @xmath0 is a quasibound state of @xmath1 .",
    "it is quite interesting that the @xmath0 can be reproduced by nonrelativisitic potential models for the @xmath1 system  @xcite .",
    "this is because the binding energy ( @xmath49 mev ) is not so large in comparison with typical hadron energy scale .",
    "( in other words , the kaon kinetic energy in the @xmath1 bound system is much smaller than the kaon mass ) .",
    "thus , if the few - body systems also have not so large binding energies , the single channel potential model is one of the reasonable approached for the kaonic few - body systems , as done in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath50 .",
    "this picture will be broken down if the binding energy is so large that the other channels become active .",
    "in such a case , the coupled channels effects should be properly treated in theoretical calculations , as done in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath50 .    here",
    "we would like to present other kaonic few - body systems , @xmath4 and @xmath51 systems with @xmath52 and @xmath53 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , these systems were investigated in a nonrelativistic three - body potential model under the assumption that the @xmath0 resonance and the scalar mesons , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , are reproduced as quasibound states of @xmath1 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the effective two - body interactions are described by complex - valued functions representing the open channels , ( @xmath57 , @xmath6 ) for @xmath19 and ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) for @xmath60 .",
    "they found a quasibound state of the @xmath4 system around 1910 mev below all of the meson - baryon decay threshold energies of the @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 states , which means that the obtained bound state is stable against breaking up to the subsystems .",
    "this quasibound state was also confirmed later by a more sophisticated calculation using a relativistic faddeev approach  @xcite . for the @xmath51 system ,",
    "the binding energy from the @xmath64 threshold was found to be as small as a few mev due to the strong repulsion @xmath65 with @xmath66  @xcite .    for the structure of the @xmath67 system , it was found that the @xmath1 and @xmath60 subsystems are dominated by @xmath16 and @xmath66 , respectively , and that these subsystems have very similar properties with those in the isolated two - particle systems .",
    "this leads to the picture that the @xmath46 system can be interpreted as coexistence state of @xmath0 and @xmath55 clusters , and @xmath5 is a constituent of both @xmath0 and @xmath55 at the same time , as seen in the @xmath50 sysytem  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the binding energy and width of the @xmath67 state is almost the sum of those in @xmath0 and @xmath55 .",
    "it is also found that the inter - hadron distances in the @xmath67 state are larger than 2 fm , which is comparable to typical nucleon - nucleon distances in nuclei .",
    "therefore , the @xmath67 system more spatially extends than typical baryons described by quark models .",
    "these features are caused by weak binding of the three hadrons , for which the @xmath68 repulsion plays an essential role .",
    "the finding that the @xmath0 keeps its properties in few - body systems motivates that picture that the @xmath0 resonance can be a doorway state of @xmath5 absorption to nuclear systems  @xcite . especially the coupling strengths of the @xmath0 to @xmath1 and @xmath2 are important parameters to understand the non - mesonic transitions @xmath69 ( @xmath70 or @xmath30 ) , which may be dominant processes of the nonmesonic @xmath5 absorption in nuclei .",
    "the @xmath0 is the `` gift '' of the meson - baryon dynamics . due to the strong attractions in the @xmath1 and @xmath6 channels ,",
    "there exists two resonance poles around the @xmath0 energies .",
    "one is essentially a @xmath1 quasibound state just below the @xmath1 threshold , the other is a @xmath6 resonance having a wide width and strong couping to the @xmath6 state .",
    "the interference of these two states forms a single resonance peak in the @xmath6 invariant mass spectra .",
    "therefore the @xmath6 invariant mass spectra depend on the initial channel for the @xmath0 production .",
    "the @xmath0 produced by the @xmath1 channel can be observed by @xmath71 . for better understanding of the @xmath0 structure and @xmath5 nuclear few - body systems ,",
    "any experimental information of the @xmath72 scattering are desired , especially the @xmath2 scattering length can fix the lower pole position of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath67 can be another example of the @xmath5 nuclear few - body systems .",
    "it is found that the @xmath46 quasi - bound system is interpreted as coexistence state of @xmath0 and @xmath55 clusters and @xmath5 is a constituent of both @xmath0 and @xmath55 at the same time .",
