    "the processes thought to eject matter away from the thin disks of spiral galaxies will act upon both gas _ and _ dust .",
    "what is the fate of dust grains participating in various types of ejection processes ? are the ejection processes violent enough to completely destroy the grains or is the destruction only partial ?",
    "conversely , does the presence of dust in galaxy halos provide important information about the nature of the ejection processes ? are the heavy elements in halo matter mostly found in dust grain cores and thus unavailable for important atomic radiative processes ?",
    "does the pressure of radiation acting on interstellar dust help support material in galaxy halos ?",
    "do `` galactic chimneys '' expel clean gas or gas containing dust ?",
    "very few of these questions can currently be answered because very little is known about the existence of dust in galaxy halos .",
    "though interstellar dust grains may play a significant role in the evolution of material undergoing circulation between the disks and halos of spiral galaxies , this role has not received much attention from an observational point of view , and is only beginning to be addressed theoretically .",
    "sofue and his coworkers have suggested that dust filaments they identify in inclined galaxies may be the results of magnetic phenomena or at least may be tracing the magnetic fields in these galaxies ( sofue 1987 ; sofue et al .",
    "1994 ) . the sofue et al .",
    "( 1994 ) paper discusses the appearence of the dust features in ngc 253 and suggests various models for the range of dust structure morphologies observed .",
    "they argue that the loops and filaments seen in this galaxy are associated with magnetic fields and may be caused by `` magnetic inflation '' or by radiatively driving dust along magnetic field lines .",
    "unfortunately , the true @xmath9-extents of the dust features identified by sofue et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in ngc 253 are rather uncertain because the galaxy is inclined @xmath13 from edge - on orientation .    in an interesting series of theoretical papers , ferrara et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , franco et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and ferrara ( 1993 ) have recently re - investigated the effects of radiation pressure on dust grains , including the possibility of radiatively driving dust grains to large @xmath9-distances in spiral galaxies .",
    "their work suggests that radiation pressure on grains can have a significant effect on the kinematics of low - halo clouds of material and may be the dominant factor in determining the dust distribution in hot halos of galaxies .",
    "though these workers have begun to address the problem , it is still not clear , theoretically or observationally , what role dust plays in the large - scale circulations that may occur between the disks and low - halos of spiral galaxies .    with this paper",
    "we begin a project to study off - plane dust structures in highly - inclined galaxies , the goal of which is to learn more about the interstellar disk - halo interface in galaxies by studying extraplanar interstellar dust . in this first paper we present images of ngc 891 taken with the 3.5-m wiyn telescope under excellent seeing conditions ( 0.6 - 0.65  fwhm ) .",
    "the images show a wealth of dust structures beyond the thin disk of the galaxy , some stretching to @xmath14 kpc .",
    "several of these absorbing structures have been mentioned by previous workers , though no in - depth discussion of their properties or discussion of their role in the disk - halo interface exists . while in many ways",
    "ngc 891 is not typical of all galaxies , the images presented herein unequivocally state the case for the presence of dust beyond the thin disk of at least one spiral galaxy .",

    "ngc 891 is a well studied sb galaxy seen near edge - on ( @xmath15 , rupen 1991 ) .",
    "it has been extensively observed over most of the electromagnetic spectrum and has been particularly important for the study of extraplanar gas .",
    "the properties of the diffuse extraplanar h@xmath16 emission in this galaxy have been discussed by numerous workers ( dettmar 1990 ; rand et al .",
    "1990 ; keppel et al .",
    "1991 ; pildis et al .",
    "these studies find diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) extending to at least 40  from the midplane of the galaxy , or @xmath17=2 kpc assuming a distance of 9.5 mpc ( van der kruit & searle 1981 ; keppel et al .",
    "1991 ) , with some studies finding evidence for dig extending further than @xmath17=5.5 kpc ( rand 1997 ) .",
    "the recent rand ( 1997 ) study suggests the ionizing spectrum responsible for this gas is significantly harder than that of the local milky way thick disk dig , based upon a comparison of the /h@xmath16  line ratio in this gas to the upper limit for milky way gas derived by reynolds & tufte ( 1995 ) .",
    "the inferred gas temperature from his observations is @xmath1810,000 - 13,000 k.    radio continuum studies of ngc 891 have similarly revealed an extended cosmic - ray halo which is generally correlated with the h@xmath16 emission ( dahlem , dettmar & hummel 1994 ) . the h@xmath16  and radio continuum observations suggest a position dependent scale height of @xmath19 kpc [ rand ( 1997 ) also finds a second component with scale height @xmath115 - 6 kpc ] and show a strong asymmetry , with the ne side of the galaxy having enhanced emission ( dahlem et al .",
    "the radio data show significant polarization , with the orientation of the polarization vectors suggesting the large - scale magnetic field structure is parallel to the plane through most of the low - halo , though there may be slight deviations toward more vertically oriented fields further from the center of the galaxy ( dumke et al .",
    "1995 ; sukumar & allen 1991 ) . the patterns of polarization in optical and infrared polarization maps have been interpreted as evidence for vertically oriented or non - toroidal magnetic fields through most of the galaxy ( scarrott & draper 1996 ; fendt et al .",
    "1996 ; jones 1997 ; wood & jones 1997 ) .",
    "the difference in the suggested orientations for the magnetic field may , in part , be due to the differing resolutions of the two data sets , or possibly to optical depth effects in the visible / ir data . though the ionized halo of ngc 891 is thick enough to provide significant faraday rotation at longer radio wavelengths , the observations by dumke et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and sukumar & allen ( 1991 ) at 2.8 and 6 cm , respectively , should be relatively free from the effects of faraday rotation and provide an accurate measure of the orientation of the magnetic field .",

    "indeed , handa et al .",
    "( 1992 ) also find evidence for co away from the midplane in the form of a `` molecular spur '' that stretches @xmath11520 pc into the halo ; they do not discuss the existence of an extended thick disk .",
    "scoville et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have presented aperture - synthesis data for the co @xmath22=1 - 0 transition .",
    "they find no evidence for the extended component of garca - burillo et al .",
    ", though their data are only sensitive to variations on spatial scales @xmath2330(@xmath231.4 kpc ) .",
    "the extended component may show evidence for a higher co ( @xmath22=2 - 1)/(@xmath22=1 - 0 ) ratio than the disk material ( garca - burillo et al .",
    "if this is indeed true , the higher-@xmath9 material may be warmer than the disk gas ; scoville et al . point out that their observations , made only in the @xmath22=1 - 0 transition , could possibly have missed an extended warm component .",
    "both the co and  ( rupen 1991 ; sancisi & allen 1979 ) observations suggest that ngc 891 lacks an appreciable warp .",

    "( 1995 , 1997 ) have reported on new , very sensitive observations of ngc 891 .",
    "the new data , and their modelling of these data , suggest that a more appropriate model for the velocity structure and vertical distribution of  in ngc 891 is a composite model having both a thin and a thick disk , with the latter lagging the former by @xmath1125 km s@xmath26 ( swaters et al .",
    "1997 ; see also van der hulst 1996 ) .",
    "these new data also exhibit  extending to @xmath27 kpc and may show enhanced @xmath9-structure in the regions of the disk that have enhanced h@xmath16  and radio continuum emission ( van der hulst 1996 ) .",
    "bregman & pildis ( 1994 ) and more recently bregman & houck ( 1997 ) have observed a diffuse x - ray halo surrounding ngc 891 with the rosat observatory .",
    "this halo has a vertical surface brightness hwhm of @xmath112 kpc ; fits to the data suggest a vertical gaussian density scale - height of @xmath113.5 kpc and t@xmath28 k ( bregman & houck 1997 ) .",
    "they calculate the mass of the x - ray emitting gas to be @xmath29 m@xmath4 ; the mid - plane density and pressure best - fit values are 0.026 @xmath30 and 10@xmath31 k @xmath30 , respectively ( for filling factors of unity ; see bregman & houck 1997 ) .",
    "much of the observed emission from the halo of ngc 891 has been interpreted ( bregman & pildis 1994 ; pildis et al .",
    "1994a ; rand et al . 1990",
    "; dettmar 1990 ) as being at least consistent with the galactic fountain model of disk - halo circulation ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ) or the chimney - dominated model of norman & ikeuchi ( 1989 ) .",
    "if the hot material traced by the x - ray emission is indeed participating in a fountain flow , bregman & houck predict gas is cooling at a rate of 0.09 m@xmath4 yr@xmath26 .",
    "the primary observations presented herein were taken on the night of 3 december 1996 with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",

    "the standard deviation of the individual measurements about the mean for a given feature is generally @xmath1110% .",
    "the systematic affect of the photon noise is minor compared to the other uncertainties involved in our measurement scheme .",

    "if we define @xmath63 as the fraction of galactic light in a given waveband emitted in front of the dust features , we may follow gallagher & hunter ( 1981 ) and knapen et al .",
    "( 1991 ) by writing @xmath64 the quantity @xmath65 is assumed to roughly approximate the extinction optical depth through the cloud at wavelength @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath65 contains contributions from pure absorption plus scattering out of the line of sight . with this formulation",
    "it is important to note that equation ( [ eqn : xtau ] ) neglects the effects of light scattered off of dust into the line of sight . the scattering phase function for interstellar dust is very forward - throwing .",
    "this implies that most of the light scattered from large angles to our sightline will not enter our beam ; the fraction that does is likely balanced by scattering of background stellar light out of the beam , implying that @xmath65 is not precisely equivalent to the true absorption plus scattering optical depth . in our application of this equation",

    "however , the derivation of the thick disk dust scale height is rife with difficulties , and hence we have not attempted it in this first paper on the extraplanar dust of ngc 891 .",
    "the derivation of such a scale height is heavily dependent upon a correct model for the distribution of stellar light in the galaxy , particularly for the presence of a stellar thick disk ( see morrison et al .",

    "some of the features show more filamentary edges and overall structure in the hst image .",
    "there are a few instances of features that are washed out by the seeing at wiyn but are detected in the hst image . however , there are also low - contrast features at high @xmath9 that are detected in the wiyn images but not the hst image .",
    "the hst image more clearly resolves into individual features some of the absorbing material that lies further along the line of sight into the galaxy . as discussed above , there still exists a tangle of overlapping features that can be picked out , but not distinguished , in the hst image .    to more clearly show the difference between the wiyn and hst views of ngc 891 , we present close - up views of the wiyn b - band and hst images for features 1 and 2 in figure [ fig : feat1 ] and for features 3 and 4 in figure [ fig : feat4 ] .",
    "the hst images do show that there are structures on finer scales than can be detected with wiyn ; however , the bulk of the structure seems to be apparent in the wiyn images .",
    "though the hst image provides a factor of six better resolution , the larger features identified in the wiyn images do not break down into separate structures in the hst image . while they may still be superpositions of several clouds along the line of sight , few if any of the structures that seem to be connected in the wiyn images are separable into distinct structures at the resolution of the hst image .",
    "feature 4 is an example of this ( see figure [ fig : feat4 ] ) . in the wiyn image",

    "this is not particularly surprising since , although the f606w filter extends much further into the red than does the v - band filter , the extinction over this bandpass is dominated by the short - wavelength end ( at least for a flat - spectrum source ) .",
    "we have measured the apparent extinctions of many of the features common to both the wiyn v - band and hst f606w images as prescribed in the last subsection , though we have used 10 pixel wide cuts for the hst image to account for the difference in pixel size .    as discussed above , the result is a spatial average of the apparent extinction for a given feature . using the standard deviation of the individual cuts about the mean for a feature as an estimate of the error",

    "there are , however , a few features for which this is not the case . these are typically characterized by having a `` core / halo '' structure , i.e. , a central very opaque feature surrounded by a less - absorbing region .",
    "the discrepancy in apparent extinction arises because we adopt the minimum brightness ratio , @xmath134 , as representative of the whole . when deriving the brightnesses from the wiyn images , our individual measurements have a similar resolution in both dimensions , using cuts with widths of 5 pixels combined with a seeing - limited resolution of 3 - 4 pixels in the perpendicular dimension .",
    "the hst measurements are less likely to be an average in both directions , having cuts of 0.1@xmath351.0  through each feature . measurements of features in the hst image , given our technique , sample the most opaque regions of these `` core / halo '' structures and are less an average of the cloud as a whole . though our measurements of apparent extinctions for various features show some discrepancies , we believe the method generally gives information appropriate for deriving the spatially - averaged properties of the absorbing structures .",
    "from the images presented herein it is immediately clear that clouds of dust , if not dust and gas , exist at large distances from the midplane of the spiral galaxy ngc 891 .",
    "it is not known how common these extraplanar dust clouds are in spiral galaxies , nor is it clear that the absorbing structures seen in this galaxy are all caused by the same phenomenon ; even given these uncertainties , it is important to begin a discussion of mechanisms that may be responsible for the features we see in the wiyn and hst images of ngc 891 . although small quantities of dust at large distances from the planes of galaxies can be produced by direct injection from evolved stars and supernovae , it appears for galaxies like ngc 891 , with extensive dust structures at large @xmath9 , that some type of ejection process from the reservoir of material in the disk is required to produce the amount of high-@xmath9 material seen .",
    "further , the complex morphologies of the structures seen in our data strongly suggest mechanisms other than direct injection for producing these absorbing features . in",
    "the following we discuss four types of ejection processes : 1 .",
    "hydrodynamical phenomena , including fountain flows .",
    "2 . expulsion by radiation pressure on dust .",
    "3 . the effects of magnetic fields , and 4 .",
    "ejection mechanisms involving dynamical instabilities .",
    "it may be possible to transport dust from the thin disks of spiral galaxies via hydrodynamical phenomena such as `` galactic fountain '' flows ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ; houck & bregman 1990 ) or `` galactic bores '' ( martos et al .",
    "1996 , cf .",
    "suchkov & shchekinov 1975 ) .",
    "the expulsion of dust in these scenarios would seem to depend sensitively upon the physical conditions at the sights of expulsion , e.g. , supershells for the fountain model . in the fountain model",
    "there are two possibilities for lifting dust beyond the thin disks of spirals .",
    "the first relies upon the upwelling hot gas to carry the dust .",
    "this mechanism seems unlikely to be able to transport a large amount of dust , either by entrainment of material as the hot gas escapes the disk or by feeding the dust into the hot interiors of supershells prior to the expulsion of the hot material , due to the extremely low density of the hot gas and the harsh conditions within this hot medium .",
    "ferrara et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , in their numerical models of dust behavior when immersed in a hot coronal halo , find that the dust is able to move relatively unimpeded in such conditions . the inverse is likely also true : when the hot gas is expanding out of the disk of the galaxy , it may not offer much lift to the dust .",
    "possibly more likely is the transport of dusty material from the thin disk within the dense walls of supershells . while the initial expansion of a supernova remnant or superbubble ( snr ) may cause strong shocks , through most of their evolution snrs expand at relatively low velocities",
    ". in this slowly moving phase a remnant sweeps up considerable mass which does not experience shocks with large velocity jumps .",
    "thus the dust swept up in this phase of snr evolution may remain relatively intact , i.e. , the shocks dust may encounter in this phase are not sufficiently strong to destroy large fractions of the grains . as a superbubble expands into the halo",
    ", it transports this undestroyed dust upwards within its walls .",
    "the chimney model of norman & ikeuchi ( 1989 ) suggests that if the supershells are able to break out they will leave remnant , kiloparsec - scale vertically - oriented walls , which may be dust - laden .",
    "indeed , koo et al .",
    "( 1992 ) have identified many candidate galactic `` worms '' in both  and iras 100 @xmath33 m emission that may be such remnants or the walls of supershells themselves .",
    "the absorbing features seen in our images may be pronounced examples of these dusty worms , particularly the features found in the ne section of the disk .",
    "feature 11 , for example , seems to be the dusty wall of a known h@xmath16  supershell .",
    "dense knots of material which follow ballistic trajectories may also be expelled from the disk by superbubbles .",
    "knots formed by rayleigh - taylor instabilities as a superbubble breaks through the disk material and begins to accelerate into the halo follow ballistic trajectories away from the disk , as they have significantly higher column densities than the halo material ( cioffi 1986 ) .",
    "these knots of material may lead to relatively disconnected clouds of dense material in the low - halo of spiral galaxies .",
    "if dust survives in these fragments of the evolved superbubble , the ejected clouds may provide a source of halo dust grains .",
    "greater knowledge of the degree to which dust can survive in the walls of supershells is needed to assess the role these structures may play in lifting dust beyond the thin disk of spirals .",
    "models which predict upwelling gas trajectories as material `` falls '' into the enhanced gravitational potential of a spiral arm , such as the `` galactic bore '' model of martos et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , may also exhibit a sensitive dependence upon the prevailing local conditions .",
    "the depth of the gravitational potential well into which the material falls and the velocity with which gas encounters the spiral density wave would both be a determining factor in the resulting temperature of the gas ( kovalenko & levy 1992 ) .",
    "thus the prevailing physical conditions where the upwelling gas is expected to be produced would depend upon the location of the gas with respect to the corotation radius , since the velocity with which gas enters the density wave depends upon its location relative to corotation , and the amplitude of the density wave .",
    "dust grains in material that encounters too strong a shock as it falls into the enhanced gravitational potential of a spiral arm may be too efficiently destroyed to produce substantial high-@xmath9 opacity , even if the gas - dust drag were sufficient to lift the grains as the heated gas expands upwards into the low halo .",
    "the literature on the effects of either model ( fountain vs. bore ) on dust grains and their distribution is quite sparse .",
    "much work needs to be done , both observationally and theoretically , before a reasonable discrimination can be made between these types of models and those that rely on other processes to lift grains from galactic thin disks .",
    "ferrara et al . ( 1991 ) , franco et al . ( 1991 ) and ferrara ( 1993 ) have suggested that radiation pressure on dust grains can play a significant role in the kinematics of both the gas and dust in spiral galaxies .",
    "franco et al . ( 1991 ) investigated the effects of radiation pressure on dusty clouds in the thick interstellar disk of the milky way , and by extension other spirals .",
    "their results suggest that interstellar clouds having gas - to - dust ratios typical for milky way clouds can be `` photolevitated '' to a few hundred parsecs above the midplane of the galaxy .",
    "clouds directly above luminous star clusters or near spiral arms may be lifted to even greater heights .",
    "ferrara ( 1993 ) , extending this work , suggested the vertical support of the neutral interstellar thick disk of the milky way ( lockman 1984 ) could be provided by turbulence when including the stellar radiation field , which lowers effective gravitational potential of the dusty material .",
    "in contrast to the studies above , which discuss the distribution of clouds near the midplane , the calculations of ferrara et al .",
    "( 1991 ) follow the trajectories of dust grains immersed in a hot hydrostatic galactic corona .",
    "they find that dust can be expelled from a model milky way disk to quite large distances ( @xmath135 kpc ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that they include no diffuse clouds beyond the @xmath136 pc initial position of the grains .",
    "diffuse clouds above the plane , even if they fill a small fraction of the grains trajectories through the halo , could cause significantly more drag than the models of ferrara et al .",
    "warm neutral clouds are known to exist at large @xmath9-heights in our galaxy .",
    "the thick disk of neutral material or `` lockman layer '' discussed above extends to @xmath9-heights in excess of 500 pc ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , while intermediate velocity clouds may lie significantly higher ( e.g. , wakker et al .",
    "however , the influence of magnetic fields may be the most significant modifier to the dust trajectories of the ferrara et al .",
    "models ( see below ) .",
    "more recently ferrara & shull ( as discussed in ferrara 1997 ) have begun modelling the time evolution of the dust distribution in the immediate vicinity of ob associations via monte carlo models .",
    "their models account for the more extended @xmath9-component of  and for the evolution of the radiation field of the ob association .",
    "they find that dust can be expelled well beyond the thin interstellar disk of their model galaxy and predict a relatively flat distribution of dust grains above these collections of stars .",
    "the models further predict that small grains tend to be expelled to greater distances than large grains . in the early evolution of their `` dusty chimneys , ''",
    "the distribution of dust in their simulations is roughly conical , with the base of the cone pointing away from the midplane ; this morphology is not unlike that of feature 10 .",
    "this work seems quite promising , for it includes the influence of the interstellar thick disk and makes predictions that should be testable with high spatial resolution infrared images of edge - on galaxies ( e.g. , with sirtf or sofia , which could be used to search for evidence for a varying degree of dust destruction or changing gas - to - dust ratios with @xmath9 ) .",
    "a concern with models that rely upon radiation pressure to expel material from the disk of a galaxy is the relatively large optical depths we have derived for the high-@xmath9 features identified in figures [ fig : wiyncenter ] and [ fig : wiynne ] .",
    "dust clouds that are self - shielding would seem to be difficult to drive radiatively and may be subject to radiation - induced instabilities . indeed , franco et al .",
    "( 1991 ) argue that clouds having @xmath137 @xmath2 or @xmath138 , assuming milky way gas - to - dust ratios , are unable to be driven effectively .",
    "this is at least a factor of two below our lowest column density / extinction estimates given in table [ table : derived ] .",
    "those features that stretch as `` columns '' vertically away from the plane may have even larger column densities and optical depths when viewed from the disk of ngc 891 ( e.g. , features 1 and 4 ) .",
    "in general radiative expulsion models predict lesser amounts of grain destruction than those methods that rely upon violent means , such as the fountain - type models , though little work has been done theoretically to describe the extent to which dust is transported or destroyed in supershells .",
    "ferrara et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have calculated that bare silicate grains lose some 20% of their mass in their @xmath139 yr trip through a model galactic corona , with graphite grains losing even less ; this time scale is similar to that of total destruction for grains in the disk of a galaxy which are exposed to the passage of multiple supernova shocks ( jones et al . 1994 ) .",
    "jones et al . ( 1994 ) calculate the fraction of grains destroyed in the passage through a strong shock is @xmath1400.29 and @xmath1400.45 for graphite and silicate grains , respectively .",
    "if grains pass through a strong shock and find themselves in the harsh hot interior of a supershell , the fraction of grain destruction may be greater than this value .",
    "a further difference between the ferrara et al .",
    "( 1991 ) predictions for the destruction of grains in a hot halo , and for the destruction one might envision in a fountain - like scenario , is that the destruction of grains in the radiatively driven scenario primarily occurs far from the disk of the galaxy . in a supernova - driven expulsion scenario ,",
    "the bulk of the dust destruction should occur within the first kpc .",
    "a clear examination of the distribution of elemental depletions with distance above the plane of our own galaxy may help to distinguish between these two types of models .",
    "abundance studies with hst ( sembach & savage 1996 ) reveal that grain cores survive the processes that lift matter to @xmath9 distances ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 kpc in the halo of the milky way .",
    "indeed , our wiyn images of ngc 891 provide the same information for an external galaxy : grains survive the trip from the galactic plane to the low - halo , by whatever means they are expelled .",
    "these observations imply that the cores of dust grains are very resilient and survive while being pushed into the halo by violent processes , or reach high-@xmath9 by less extreme means , such as via radiation pressure .",
    "knowledge of the dust properties of supershells in the milky way and in other galaxies may constrain the amount of dust that is destroyed in these structures and help determine whether they are able to expel dust from the thin disks of spirals .",
    "it may be possible to search for evidence of grain destruction in the dust features we have discussed here using emission line imaging or spectroscopy of the near - infrared [ ] and pa@xmath141 lines . the [ ] /pa@xmath141 ratio is known to be enhanced in regions of supernova activity as the dust is destroyed , freeing fe from the solid phase ( greenhouse et al .",
    "the presence of enhanced [ ] emission ( over typical regions , say ) would be an indicator of dust destruction and likely supernova activity .",
    "high - resolution images would be required to search for emission from specific features ; hst , with the newly installed nicmos instrument , might be useful for doing exactly this .",
    "recent radio continuum observations at 2.8 cm ( dumke et al .",
    "1995 ; see also sukumar & allen 1991 ) , where the effects of faraday depolarization are likely very minor , suggest that the magnetic field geometry in ngc 891 is predominantly parallel to the plane , on the large scale .",
    "the orientation of visible and near - infrared polarization vectors in ngc 891 suggest , however , a vertical magnetic field if the polarization is due to aligned grains ( scarrott & draper 1996 ; wood & jones 1997 ) . again",
    ", this discrepancy may be due to the differing resolutions of the two datasets or to optical depth effects in the optical / ir region .",
    "the presence of magnetic fields , particularly parallel to the plane , may significantly affect the processes that cycle material between the disks and halos of spiral galaxies , though we have thus far neglected the role of magnetic fields in our discussion .",
    "the addition of magnetic pressure in the calculated evolution of snrs generally leads to smaller remnants , at least in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic fields ( cf . , slavin & cox 1992 ) .",
    "magnetic fields oriented parallel to the plane of a spiral galaxy provide a tension that could confine the @xmath9-expansion of superbubbles .",
    "this tension makes it more difficult for large superbubbles to break out of the thin interstellar disk of a galaxy ; all of which would seem to suggest that the presence of magnetic fields might quench disk - halo circulation in disk galaxies if of sufficient strength and the correct orientation .",
    "on the other hand , a configuration wherein horizontal magnetic fields provide partial support against a vertical gravitational field is subject to the parker instability ( parker 1966 ) . as a supershell or",
    "other disturbance pushes the field upward in a small region , matter slides down the field lines , which reduces the weight providing confinement of the magnetic field .",
    "the field continues its expansion to higher @xmath9 , given that less material is holding it down , forming an @xmath103-shaped structure as matter continues to slide down the now - vertical sides of the magnetic arch .",
    "this process , known as the parker instability , may play an important role in the dynamics of interstellar material ( basu et al .",
    "1997 ; matsumoto et al .",
    "1990 ) . though magnetic fields are generally thought to impede the blow - out of superbubbles into the halo , the existence of a parker - unstable region of a spiral may in fact aid in the lifting of material beyond the thin disk ( kamaya et al .",
    "the parker instability may be excited variously by supernovae - driven phenomena ( kamaya et al .",
    "1996 ) or by inflation of relativistically hot cosmic - ray gas ( parker 1992 ) .",
    "indeed , a subset of the absorbing structures seen in ngc 891 is reminiscent of magnetically shaped phenomena .",
    "further , the parker instability predicts that matter will flow down the sides of the arched magnetic field .",
    "the material that has fallen down either side of the field structure will appear as a vertically - oriented `` column . ''",
    "structures such as feature 4 could represent the end result of this type of magnetic field evolution .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field could also significantly affect the expulsion of dusty material via radiation pressure from galactic starlight .",
    "if the magnetic fields are predominantly parallel to the plane of a galaxy , it would seem difficult to radiatively expel grains from the thin disk , assuming the grains are charged and would thus be coupled to the magnetic field . in regions where the magnetic field runs perpendicular to the disk , this would be less significant a problem .",
    "sofue et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have suggested that the absorbing structures seen in ngc 253 may be caused by radiation driving along vertical magnetic fields .",
    "they argue that magnetic fields should be invoked because of the general morphologies of their features , particularly given the coherency exhibited by their features over lengths of a kpc or more .",
    "though the radio observations suggest that the large scale field lies generally parallel to the disk , there may be small - scale variations in the magnetic field geometries along which dust could be driven .",
    "the fact that vertical fields do not dominate the radio continuum observations suggests , however , that coherent vertically - oriented fields stretching for large distances are not likely ; thus it would be difficult to drive grains to the very large @xmath9-heights suggested by the ferrara et al .",
    "( 1991 ) models .",
    "however , for the structures apparent in the wiyn images , it may be the case that the local fields run perpendicular for long enough distances to allow radiation pressure expulsion of grains to the requisite heights",
    ".      it may be possible to lift material from the thin disk via dynamical instabilities .",
    "binney ( 1981 ) and mulder & hooimeyer ( 1984 ) have studied resonant excitation of @xmath9-directed instabilities in the collisionless motions of stars , concluding that stars in flattened potentials may be driven in the @xmath9-direction via resonant coupling of @xmath9-oscillations and changes in the radial component of the force .",
    "the coupling requires highly eccentric orbits or non - axisymmetric potentials , i.e. , bars . for disk galaxies",
    "this coupling occurs in only relatively thin annuli at specific radii .",
    "more recently erwin & sparke ( 1997 , in preparation ) have investigated models of pre - main sequence gaseous circumbinary accretion disks by following the orbits of particles which have a fixed artificial viscosity ; they similarly find that material may be excited to highly inclined orbits via dynamical instabilities and resonances .",
    "all of these models rely upon resonances of particle orbits with non - axisymmetric or bar - like potentials to excite the vertical motions .",
    "though there may be evidence for a central bar in ngc 891 ( garca - burillo & gulin 1995 ) , there still exists the problem of energy dissipation in self- or disk - crossing orbits .",
    "these investigations have all studied _ collisionless _ orbits , while for the present problem of gaseous material , orbits that are self - crossing or disk plane - crossing may lead to significant energy loss and possibly shocks .",
    "it has yet to be seen whether gaseous material can fully participate in these trajectories given its collisional nature",
    ". it may be the case that parcels of the ism can be thrown out of the plane of a barred galaxy , but that the trajectory may be significantly altered as it nears the plane by the material s interaction with disk gas .",
    "also the orbits described by binney ( 1981 ) and mulder & hooimeyer ( 1984 ) rely upon resonance effects which , for a characteristic @xmath9-oscillation frequency , occur in thin annuli at specific distances . thus if the dust seen away from the plane of ngc 891",
    "were expelled via this type of resonant coupling , we would expect to find no high-@xmath9 material beyond a cut - off point at some projected distance from the center of the galaxy , which is not seen .",
    "dynamical instabilities as a whole can probably not be rejected at this time , though it is not clear that they are capable of producing the wide - spread extraplanar dust seen in ngc 891 .",
    "it is not the case that all galaxies show an extensive network of extraplanar dust structures like that seen in ngc 891 .",
    "a counter example to this phenomenon is the sb galaxy ngc 4565 , also at a distance of @xmath1110 mpc ; initial wiyn images of this galaxy at 0.75  resolution show a few very localized examples of dust stretching away from the midplane to high @xmath9 , but nothing like the pervasive extraplanar dust found in ngc 891 .",
    "while it is too early to definitively declare causes for the phenomenon of extraplanar dust in ngc 891 , it is important to point out that ngc 891 is not typical of most galaxies in various respects , extraplanar dust structures possibly being one .",
    "the radio continuum and h@xmath16  halos found in ngc 891 are not common .",
    "hummel et al . (",
    "1991 ) , in a search for extended radio continuum halos around edge - on galaxies , found only 10% of the galaxies show any extended-@xmath9 emission ; only 5% of these were thought to be good candidates for the further study of extraplanar emission .",
    "further , it is becoming increasingly clear that extraplanar h@xmath16emitting material is not common among galaxies , particularly relatively smoothly distributed , wide - spread emission as seen about ngc 891 ( rand 1996 ; pildis et al .",
    "1994b ; dettmar 1992 ) .",
    "several galaxies show filamentary extensions ( e.g. , ngc 5775 ) , while some exhibit a patchy distribution of ionized material ( e.g. , ngc 4217 ) .",
    "the few galaxies that seem to show evidence for smoothly distributed or wide - spread extraplanar dig generally have relatively high far - infrared luminosities and surface brightnesses , which may indicate that the existence and appearance of extraplanar h@xmath16  emission from galaxies depends on the star formation rate or star formation rate per unit area of the underlying disk ( rand 1996 ) .",
    "the extraplanar dig in ngc 891 is significantly brighter than that from most other galaxies .",
    "the ionizing spectrum required to produce the observed emission line ratios from the ionized halo of ngc 891 is likewise quite extreme , though the only point of comparison currently available is the dig of the milky way .",
    "the very deep spectrum of the extraplanar dig obtained by rand ( 1997 ) suggests that nearly 70% of the he in this diffuse layer may be singly - ionized .",
    "this conclusion is based upon the ratio of the 5876   line to h@xmath16 ; the input spectrum required to provide this level of ionization is significantly harder than that required by the reynolds & tufte ( 1995 ) result for dig in the milky way .",
    "if the strength of the extraplanar dig and radio continuum emission in ngc 891 is indeed related to vigorous star formation in the underlying disk , the spectacular extraplanar dust features seen in our wiyn images may also be a result of the enhanced energy input associated with high levels of star formation .",
    "if these dust structures are the result of a very high star formation rate within the disk of ngc 891 , they may be shaped by the hydrodynamical afterlives of massive stars or the enhanced radiative driving force on dusty clouds due to the greater number of these stars , or perhaps by the combination of the two mechanisms .",
    "we emphasize once again that the potential energies derived in sect .",
    "[ subsec : derived ] are very much lower limits to the input energies required to lift the observed dust structures from the midplane . in models involving explosively - driven expulsion , the consideration of radiative losses and conversion of kinetic into thermal energy may require as much as an order of magnitude greater energy input in order to lift the clouds to their current positions than those given in table [ table : derived ] .",
    "thus , if the structures we see in ngc 891 are shaped primarily by the effects of multiple supernovae , the energy input of several thousand such explosions may be required to explain the @xmath9-heights of several of these absorbing features .",
    "this is a great deal of energy , though not outside the realm of possibility for the larger ob associations .",
    "rand ( 1996 ) has found that several galaxies show quite localized patches of extraplanar dig ( e.g. , ngc 4217 and ngc 5023 ) .",
    "if these cases of localized dig are due to very locally enhanced star formation rate , we might expect to find extraplanar dust filaments only in these regions of the galaxies ; for ngc 891 , or other galaxies with wide - spread h@xmath16  emission , there may be high levels of star formation activity throughout the disk , and thus also wide - spread extraplanar dust features , if the dust structures are driven by star formation .",
    "the dust features seen in ngc 891 may very well represent extragalactic examples of the dusty `` worms '' of koo et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , particularly as seen in their iras 100 @xmath33 m images , or the walls of the `` chimneys '' postulated by norman & ikeuchi ( 1989 ) .",
    "we note that the star formation rate of ngc 4565 , which does not show widespread extraplanar dust features , is significantly lower than that of ngc 891 ( as traced by the far - infrared luminosity , which is 20% of that found from ngc 891 ) .",
    "for now we can only speculate that the existence of the dust structures discussed in this paper _ may _ be associated with the relatively high star formation rate of ngc 891 .",
    "the discussion in sect .",
    "[ subsec : thickdisk ] regarding pure number counts , while obviously incomplete , shows that @xmath142 m@xmath4 of gas may exist well beyond the thin disk of ngc 891 .",
    "garca - burillo et al . (",
    "1992 ) comment that their extended component of co emission might have a total mass in the range @xmath143 m@xmath4 .",
    "while this is not conclusive evidence , there may be a connection between the dust seen in our wiyn images and the high-@xmath9 co emission reported by garca - burillo et al .",
    "also , the dusty features seen here may be connected with high - velocity cloud populations observed in spiral galaxies .",
    "schulman et al . ( 1994 ) find several galaxies with high - velocity wings that may represent a population of high - velocity clouds .",
    "they derive gas masses for this component in the range @xmath144 to @xmath145 m@xmath4 , 4 - 14% of the total estimated  mass of the galaxies in question .",
    "the fractional and total masses of this material are not unlike our estimates for the dust - containing features above the plane of ngc 891 , possibly also suggesting a connection between these components .",
    "the masses of individual extraplanar dust features are similar to those of the galactic giant molecular clouds .",
    "might these dust features be high-@xmath9 examples of such clouds ?",
    "if the masses derived here are correct , or lower limits given our neglect of scattering , the possibility exists that star formation may be occuring well away from the plane of ngc 891 in some of these structures . particularly for the most opaque structures , such as feature 1 . a careful search for young extraplanar star clusters and possible",
    "associated h@xmath16  emission will be a goal for our next investigation of ngc 891 .",
    "we present high - resolution ( 0.60 - 0.65 ) optical bvr images of the edge - on sb galaxy ngc 891 obtained with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope .",
    "the images reveal a wealth of halo absorbing dust structures viewed against the background stellar light of the galaxy .",
    "a study of these structures leads us to the following conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "the wiyn images reveal hundreds of dust absorption structures in the disk - halo boundary of ngc 891 .",
    "the structures have a wide range of often complex morphologies and are found up to @xmath111.5 kpc from the mid - plane of the galaxy .",
    "the dust features can not be attributed to a warp because they extend to both sides of the mid - plane of ngc 891 .",
    "the features are not likely to be associated with a flared gas layer at large galactocentric distances because the wiyn data reveal evidence for foreground stellar light and some of the features appear to be associated with star formation events in the disk .",
    "we attribute the dust structures to inner galaxy ( r@xmath14610 kpc ) high-@xmath9 features .",
    "the dust features provide important information about the processes that eject gas and dust into galaxy halos .",
    "twelve dust structures identified for detailed study are typically hundreds of pc in length and 50 to 100 pc in width . assuming a milky way hydrogen to dust extinction ratio , the inferred total hydrogen column densities in these features range from @xmath111 to 4@xmath3510@xmath147 @xmath2 , and their masses range from @xmath112 to 50@xmath3510@xmath31 m@xmath4 .",
    "the gravitational potential energies of the dust structures are greater than 20 to @xmath11200@xmath3510@xmath148 ergs .",

    "the higher - resolution hst image discussed herein shows the structures to be filamentary on a scale even finer than that seen in the wiyn images . some of the observed complexity may be due to overlapping clouds along the line of sight .",
    "we estimate at least 120 dust features exist at @xmath149 pc with @xmath150 mag . assuming galactic gas to dust ratios",
    ", the total implied mass of gas associated with these dust structures exceeds @xmath10 m@xmath4 , or approximately 2% of the total neutral gas mass of ngc 891 .",
    "there may be a significantly greater number of structures than our counts suggest due to confusion along the line of sight and our inability to pick out structures deep into the galaxy because of foreground stellar light contamination .",
    "several dust structures are clearly associated with h@xmath16  emission structures that extend from regions of very active star formation in the disk towards the halo .",
    "the most pronounced examples are bubble- and cone - shaped .",
    "the off - plane dust structures have apparent extinction properties best characterized by @xmath151 , where @xmath73  is the ratio of v - band selective to total extinction .",
    "this value is roughly consistent with the typical @xmath73  for galactic diffuse clouds .",
    "the effects of large amounts of extinction , due to the presence of extensive quantities of dust at large @xmath9-distances from the plane of ngc 891 , must be allowed for when attempting to interpret other data relating to off - plane stellar and interstellar emission from ngc 891 .",
    "the high values of @xmath91  and large inferred masses for the more prominent halo dust structures raises the possibility that much of the hydrogen in these features is molecular and that some of the clouds may be sites for current or future star formation .",
    "we have reviewed a number of expulsion mechanisms that might explain the existence of extraplanar gas and dust in the halos of spiral galaxies .",
    "in several cases the dust features we observe have shapes and energy requirements suggestive of ejection phenomena driven by multiple supernova , such as galactic chimney and fountain processes .",
    "others have appearances open to a wide range of possible explanations .",
    "\\11 . the processes that lift gas and dust into galaxy halos evidently are not violent enough to completely destroy the dust grains .",
    "important non - destructive processes worthy of detailed study include low - temperature galactic fountains , the radiative expulsion of grains and various magnetic and dynamical processes .",

    "<S> the dust structures have a wide range of morphologies and are clearly visible to @xmath0 kpc from the mid - plane . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the general characteristics of the population of absorbing structures , as well as physical properties of 12 individual features . </S>",
    "<S> these 12 structures are characterised by @xmath1 @xmath2 , with masses estimated to be more than @xmath3 m@xmath4 , assuming galactic gas - to - dust relationships . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational potential energies of the individual dust structures , given their observed heights and derived masses , lie in the range of @xmath5 ergs , which represents the energy input of at least tens to hundreds of supernovae . </S>",

    "<S> if these have similar properties to those structures studied in detail , the mass of high-@xmath9 gas associated with extraplanar dust in ngc 891 likely exceeds @xmath10 m@xmath4 , which is @xmath112% of the total neutral ism mass of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the absorbing properties of extraplanar dust structures in ngc 891 are best fit with @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the new wiyn images with an archival hubble space telescope image of the central region of ngc 891 suggests that the quantities we measure for the extraplanar dust features are not seriously affected by atmospheric blurring in the wiyn images .    </S>",
    "<S> some of the dust features seen in ngc 891 suggest supernova - driven galactic fountain or chimney phenomena are responsible for their production and are clearly associated with ionized gas structures thought to be tracing the violent disk - halo interface of this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> however , other structures are not so readily associated with these energetic processes . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss several mechanisms which may produce high-@xmath9 dust structures such as those seen in the wiyn and hst images presented here . </S>",
    "<S> it is , however , less than clear which of these mechanisms are primarily responsible for the extensive extraplanar dust structures seen in our images . </S>",
