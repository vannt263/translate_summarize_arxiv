    "the optical properties and optical dynamics of molecular aggregates with a cylindrical geometry currently draw considerable attention .",
    "both natural and synthetic forms of such molecular nanotubes are investigated . among the natural systems ,",
    "the rod shaped light - harvesting complexes in the chlorosomes of green bacteria are well - known examples.@xcite the chlorosomes of _ chloroflexus aurantiacus _ contain tens of thousands of bacteriochlorophyll molecules self - assembled in cylindrical structures with a monolayer wall of roughly @xmath0 nm diameter and a length of hundreds of nanometers.@xcite the light - harvesting system of the bacterium _ chlorobium tepidum _ also contains cylindrical aggregates , with a bilayer wall and a diameter of roughly @xmath1nm.@xcite these natural systems should be referred to as j aggregates , as the absorption spectrum is red - shifted relative to the transition frequency of a single bacteriochlorophyll molecule .",
    "j aggregates with a cylindrical geometry have recently also been prepared via synthetic routes . in particular a class of substituted 5,5,6,6-tetrachlorobenzimidacarbocyanine dyes has been created that forms such aggregates ; the cylindrical geometry was revealed using cryo - tem.@xcite it has been demonstrated that the precise morphology as well as the details of the optical properties depends on the nature of the substituents and the solvent.@xcite these synthetic cylinders usually have bilayer walls with an outer diameter of about @xmath2 nm and a wall thickness of @xmath3 nm . the cylinder length extends to several hundreds of nanometers .",
    "recently , the ( helical ) arrangement of the molecules inside the bilayer wall of such aggregates has been determined for the first time .",
    "this was done for the aggregates of the dye 3,3-bis(3-sulfopropyl)-5,5,6,6-tetrachloro-1,1-dioctylbenzimidacarbocyanine ( c8s3 ) , by modeling the data from cryo - tem , absorption and linear dichroism measurements.@xcite a frenkel exciton model based on two weakly interacting bricklayer monolayers wrapped on cylindrical surfaces of appropriate diameter gave a good fit to experiment .",
    "very recently , it has been discovered that bilayer molecular nanotubes ( diameter 14 nm ) may also be formed through self - assembly of amphiphilic hexi-_peri-_hexabenzocoronene molecules.@xcite another class of synthetic cylindrical aggregates are those formed through self - assembly of the dye meso - tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin ( ttps@xmath4 ) in acidic aqueous solution.@xcite from small angle x - ray scattering ( saxs)@xcite and atomic force microscopy ( afm)@xcite it has been concluded that these aggregates are hollow monolayer tubes with a diameter of about 20 nm .",
    "finally , it has been shown that under the influence of tetrahedral chemical defects conjugated polymers may also adopt ordered cylindrical conformations.@xcite    in previous model studies of cylindrical aggregates , we have mainly restricted ourselves to homogeneous aggregates , i.e. , we have ignored the role of disorder on the frenkel exciton states that determine the optical response.@xcite an important simplification occurs in this case , as the cylindrical symmetry may then be used to distinguish excitons in classes ( bands ) of different transverse quantum number @xmath5 , which describes the bloch nature of the exciton wave function in the direction along the circumference of the cylinder.@xcite the exciton eigenstates may then be determined from a set of one - dimensional effective hamiltonians for each value of @xmath5 .",
    "importantly , the introduction of the transverse quantum number dictates simple selection rules , which state that only states with @xmath6 or @xmath7 can be observed in linear optics .",
    "states in the @xmath6 band give rise to absorption polarized along the cylinder s axis , while states with @xmath8 yield a polarization perpendicular to this axis .",
    "for each of these three bands only a few strongly allowed ( superradiant ) exciton states occur.@xcite    in spite of the fact that usually appreciable energetic or interaction disorder occur in self - assembled molecular aggregates , it turns out that a homogeneous aggregate model , with the simple selection rules discussed above , does describe the salient features of experimentally observed spectra .",
    "for instance , using this model , the experimentally observed variation in the cd spectra of the chlorosomes of _ chloroflexus aurantiacus _ was explained.@xcite similarly , the polarization dependent spectra of the bilayer c8s3 cylinders are rather well described neglecting the role of disorder.@xcite we have shown , however , that the inclusion of static energy disorder does improve the comparison to experiment for the latter case.@xcite similarly , model results for chlorosomes that do account for disorder also show a better quantitative comparison to experiment.@xcite    the aim of this paper is to systematically study the effect of static diagonal disorder on the optical spectra of cylindrical molecular aggregates and to study the exciton localization properties caused by the presence of disorder . while the formalism used applies to general cylindrical aggregates , we will in explicit calculations restrict ourselves to cylinders of the structure of chlorosomes of _ chloroflexus aurantiacus_. as observable quantities , we will focus on the absorption , linear dichroism ( ld ) , and circular dichroism ( cd ) spectra .",
    "the disorder averages of these specta are calculated using numerical simulations as well as a modified version of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) that accounts for finite - size effects .",
    "localization properties have been extensively studied for frenkel excitons in linear @xcite and circular @xcite aggregates . for the higher dimensional cylindrical aggregates ,",
    "such studies have not been performed yet .",
    "we will fill this gap by investigating the inverse participation ratio and an autocorrelation function of the wave function .",
    "using the latter , we will show a strong anisotropy in the localization properties of the excitons , which may be traced back to the recently discovered chiral behavior of the exciton wave functions on finite homogeneous cylindrical aggregates,@xcite dictated by the behavior of the dipolar excitation exchange interactions in the system .",
    "we will also demonstrate that the cd spectrum may exhibit a dependence on the cylinder s length , even when the excitons are localized on regions small compared to the its size .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "this is common practice . for higher - dimensional aggregates , however , such as planes or cylinders",
    ", this method may be quite demanding , due to the large number of molecules involved in these systems and the tendency for the collective excitations to be more delocalized in higher dimensions .",

    "in contrast to the homogeneous case , however , to calculate the cpa spectra we still need the eigenenergies of all states in all @xmath5 bands .",
    "the reason is that these energies occur in the quantity @xmath128 ( eq .  ( [ approximation ] ) ) , which is needed to solve for the self - energy .",

    "( [ tmatrix ] ) to be site - independent .",

    "conversely , if in eq .",
    "( [ gnn ] ) we would boldly substitute the solution for the homogeneous solution with open boundary conditions applied along the @xmath17 direction , we would obtain a site - dependent ( @xmath17 dependent ) self - energy , which would be inconsistent in the context of the cpa .",

    "it is clear from fig .  2 that the cpa with periodic boundary conditions yields spectra that differ notably from the exact ones , both in the position and shape of spectral features .",
    "the agreement is especially bad for short cylinders , where finite - size effects are most prominent . at all sizes",
    "considered ( even for @xmath152 ) the modified cpa constitutes a better approximation than the one with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we note that the spectra obtained by using periodic boundary conditions are always red - shifted relative to the exact and the modified - cpa spectra .",
    "this results from the fact that for periodic boundary conditions every molecule interacts with other molecules that are at most half a cylinder length away , while using the correct open boundary conditions , the molecules near one edge of the cylinder ( @xmath17 small ) have much weaker interactions with the molecules at the other edge ( @xmath153 ) . thus , using periodic boundary conditions , one overestimates the effect of the interactions , which shifts the spectrum too far away from the monomer transition .    as final issue , we discuss the comparison between the exact spectra and the experimental ones . in our previous work@xcite",
    "we made this comparison neglecting the effects of disorder in the model .",
    "one may consider those previous results as one extreme case , where all spectral broadening is assumed to arise from homogeneous broadening , while the current spectra constitute the other extreme situation , where the widths are assumed to purely result from inhomogeneity .",
    "like in the homogeneous case reported in ref .  , we see that in particular the cd spectra exhibit a strong dependence on the length @xmath9 of the cylinder .",
    "this length dependence , specifically the change of the cd line shape around @xmath154 , was an important point in our previous work , as it suggests that the strong variation in the reported cd spectra of chlorosomes@xcite results from the fact that different samples contain chlorosomes of different length .",
    "apparently this conclusion survives the incorporation of disorder and the concomitant localization of the exciton states .",
    "we stress that at the disorder value considered the typical exciton localization size in the region of the absorption band is several tens of molecules ( sec .",
    "[ results2 ] ) .",
    "thus , one would expect the spectra to be size - saturated at cylinder lengths of at most several tens of rings .",
    "for the absorption and ld spectra , this indeed is the case , except that small shifts of the entire line shape still occur for longer cylinders as a result of the long - range dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "the slower size saturation for the cd spectrum results from two aspects .",
    "first , the presence of the intermolecular distances in the expression for the rotational strengths ( cf .",
    "( [ xcd ] ) ) contribute to a prolonged size dependence .",
    "second , being a difference spectrum , the cd spectrum is much more sensitive to the already mentioned small shifts in the exciton energies that result from the long - range interactions .",
    "the fact that for clorosomes the length dependence of the cd spectrum survives the inclusion of disorder was also suggested by prokhorenko et al.@xcite they based this conclusion on a study of the so - called cdm - matrix over a limited length interval , rather than a direct study of the spectrum .    while the spectra for the model with disorder follow the same general trends as those without disorder , the more detailed comparison to experiment is better for the case with disorder .",
    "first , in the presence of disorder the high - energy dip in the cd spectra for @xmath155 is seen to have a smaller amplitude than the low - energy dip , while this ratio is opposite for the homogeneous case.@xcite in experiment , the type of cd spectra with two negative dips indeed always have a smaller amplitude for the high - energy dip .",
    "the effect of disorder is to smear out the high - energy dip , giving it a smaller amplitude .",
    "second , the presence of disorder gives the absorption and ld spectra a more pronounced high - energy tail than is obtained for the homogeneous model .",
    "indeed , these tails , quite typical for disordered j aggregates , are observed in experiment .",
    "to finish this section , we present in fig .  3 the density of states for the disordered model ( solid line , obtained from simulations ) and the homogeneous one ( dotted line ) , both for @xmath152 .",
    "as above , the disorder was taken to be @xmath149 @xmath150 ; the sticks in the density of states for the homogeneous case were convoluted with lorentzian curves of fwhm@xmath156@xmath150 .",
    "the disorder clearly smears the discrete peaks still visible for the homogeneous case and leads to one broad feature that peaks somewhere in the middle of the exciton band .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the frequently studied one - dimensional aggregates , where the density of states , even in the presence of disorder , peaks at the band edges .",
    "so , even while the cylinder constitutes a strongly anisotropic system , its density of states deviates from a simple one - dimensional picture .",
    "we now turn in more detail to the localization of the exciton wave functions . as a first step",
    ", we consider the participation ratio @xmath157 . in fig .  4 , we have plotted @xmath158 for chlorosomes within the homogeneous model ( fig .",
    "4(a ) , @xmath152 ) and the disordered model ( fig .",
    "4(b ) , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 ) . in the homogeneous model we replaced the delta functions in eq .",
    "( [ parratio ] ) and the density of states by lorentzians with a fwhm of @xmath163@xmath150 , while in the disordered case ( disorder strength @xmath149 @xmath150 , as in the previous section ) , we used the smoothening technique@xcite to reduce the noise in the simulations .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath164 was introduced to guarantee that for the homogeneous case we recover the total number of molecules @xmath48 in the cylinder , see discussion below eq .",
    "( [ parratio ] ) .",
    "this is clear from fig .",
    "4(a ) , where , indeed , inside the exciton band @xmath158 obtains an almost constant value of 1500 molecules , the total number of molecules in a cylinder of 250 rings .    in fig .",
    "4(b ) we see that the disorder strength of @xmath165@xmath150 leads to clear localization of the exciton states at all energies , even in the centre of the band , where the robustness against localization always is strongest .",
    "the fact that the band edge states are rather strongly localized is not surprising : the ratio of the disorder strength @xmath45 and the total exciton bandwidth is approximately @xmath166 . in the spectral region where the absorption band occurs",
    "( @xmath167 nm ) , the participation ratio yields a number of several tens of molecules over which the exciton states are delocalized .",
    "we emphasize that this number varies substantially ( by a factor of @xmath168 ) over the width of the absorption band . on the other hand",
    ", it is seen that in this energy region , the participation ratio hardly depends on the cylinder length anymore , which is in accordance with the fact that the exciton states are localized on a region of the cylinder that is much smaller than its total size . at the peak of the absorption spectrum ( about @xmath169 nm ) , the calculated participation ratio implies that the excitons are shared coherently by about @xmath170 molecules ( the autocorrelation function yields @xmath171 molecules , see below ) .",
    "this value may be compared with the number of @xmath172 obtained from measuring the bleaching ratio in absorption difference experiments.@xcite given the large variation in the localization size over the absorption band , the arbitrariness and uncertainty present in any definition of a localization size , and the nonlinear nature of the absorption difference experiments , the agreement between our simulations and these experimental data is good .",
    "our localization size is considerably smaller than the @xmath173 molecules obtained in the simulations of prokhorenko et al.@xcite still , for the same reasons as stressed above already , considerable room exists for deviations in the values reported from different model studies .    to obtain insight into the possible anisotropy of the localization properties",
    ", we also studied the autocorrelation function @xmath88 defined in eq .",
    "( [ coh ] ) .",
    "we note that this anisotropy may also be studied by plotting individual wave functions , as we did in fig .",
    "10 of ref .  , but such plots",
    "have the drawback that they represent arbitrarily picked and _ hopefully _ typical states , while the correlation function gives statistical information . in fig .",
    "5 we present three - dimensional plots ( ( a)-(c ) ) as well as contour plots ( ( d)-(f ) ) of @xmath174 for frequencies corresponding to wavelengths of , respectively , @xmath175 nm , @xmath169 nm , and @xmath176 nm for a cylinder of length @xmath152 and a disorder strength of @xmath149 @xmath150 . to make these plots , the cylinder was cut along a line parallel to the @xmath23 axis ( the @xmath17 axis in the plots ) and unwrapped .    several observations can immediately be made from fig .",
    "first , with increasing energy the wave functions clearly get more extended , which is in agreement with fig .",
    "in fact , if we calculate @xmath92 ( defined at the end of section  [ model ] ) from @xmath88 , we find for @xmath152 the values @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 .",
    "these values are in reasonably good agreement with those obtained from the participation ratio : @xmath180 , @xmath181 , and @xmath182 .",
    "we also note that the values for @xmath92 ( and the plots for @xmath88 ) at 740 and 780 nm do not depend on the cylinder length anymore at @xmath152 .",
    "second , as is most clearly visible in the contour plots , at the short length scale the wave functions exhibit a clear anisotropy along a direction that is neither given by @xmath17=constant , nor by @xmath18=constant , i.e. , neither in the ring direction , nor in the direction of the helices drawn as dashed line in fig .  1 .",
    "in fact , the slanting direction of the contours relative to the vertical axis observed in fig .  5 ( which varies slightly with varying energy ) , closely resembles the slanting of the equal - phase lines of the wave functions in the @xmath7 bands of the homogeneous cylinder discovered in ref .  .",
    "in the remainder of this section , we will explain this behavior , starting with a perturbative picture in which weak disorder mixes exciton states within and between the @xmath5 bands that exist for homogeneous cylinders .    in ref .",
    ", we have shown that the optically dominant exciton states in the @xmath6 and @xmath8 bands of the homogeneous cylinder are well approximated by analytical expressions of the form eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) with the ansatz @xmath183 here , @xmath55 is a positive integer , small compared to @xmath9 for the states of interest , @xmath184 , @xmath14 is the helical angle of the cylinder ( see fig .  1 ) , and @xmath185 is a phase angle that is used to optimize the quality of the ansatz for the complex effective one - dimensional hamiltonian of the band with wave number @xmath5.@xcite the ansatz eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) is exact if transfer interactions only occur between molecules on nearest - neighbor rings ; in that case , the total angle @xmath186 is the phase of the effective nearest - ring interaction . optimizing @xmath185 approximately accounts for mixing of the wave functions eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) by non - nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "the angle @xmath185 was found to be responsible for the slanting of equal - phase lines of the wave functions in the @xmath8 band of the homogeneous cylinder ( chirality of the wave functions ) relative to the vertical axis , which seems essential to understand the behavior of @xmath88 observed in fig .",
    "5(d)-(f ) .",
    "we therefore reconsider the ansatz solutions eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) , with a special focus on @xmath185 and extending the treatment to the bottom regions of all @xmath5 bands .    _ the @xmath6 band . _",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath6 band is real , implying that also the wave functions can be chosen real .",
    "hence , we have @xmath187 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "that the bottom state of this band ( the @xmath188 state , which carries @xmath189 of the oscillator strength in this band ) is well described by the ansatz . for this band ,",
    "the wave function has equal amplitude on all molecules of a certain ring , while the quantum number @xmath55 gives the number of maxima along the @xmath23 axis of the cylinder .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "6(a ) , where we plotted the amplitude squared of the exact wave function ( obtained by numerical diagonalization ) of the lowest state in the @xmath6 band of the homogeneous cylinder .    _",
    "the @xmath8 bands . _",
    "the effective hamiltonian for these two degenerate bands is essentially complex and the phase factor in eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) is needed . in ref .",
    "we have shown that the superradiant states ( three in each band ) all occur near @xmath190}$ ] ( nint denoting the nearest integer function ) , which is a finite energy above the bottom of the @xmath191 bands .",
    "excellent agreement was found between the ansatz wave functions and those for the superradiant states of the homogeneous cylinder obtained by numerical diagonalization for the optimized value of @xmath192.@xcite presently , we are not only interested in the superradiant states , but even more so in the states near the bottom of the @xmath8 bands ( @xmath55 in the order of unity ) , because these states are closest to the bottom of the @xmath6 band and should be expected to mix with those states in the presence of ( weak ) disorder .",
    "we may apply the same approach as followed in ref .   for the superradiant states to the states near the band bottom .",
    "thus , we fix @xmath193 such that the mixing between the bottom states in the @xmath8 bands resulting from the long - range interactions does not diverge .",
    "this eventually yields @xmath194 ( for @xmath152 ) , which only slightly differs from the phase angle in the superradiant region .    if we plot the amplitude squared of the exciton wave function on the unwrapped cylinder , a state of the form eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) gives lines of equal intensity that are dictated by lines of equal phase @xmath195 .",
    "the angle @xmath196 of these lines with the @xmath23 axis is easily derived to obey @xmath197 this implies that the wave function rotates around the cylinder over a number rings given by @xmath198 from this we find that in @xmath8 bands @xmath199 for the wave functions of the superradiant states and @xmath200 for the bottom states . in fig .",
    "6(b ) we show the amplitude squared for the bottom state of the @xmath201 band obtained by numerical diagonalization .",
    "of course , on every ring we find a modulation with two maxima , as is appropriate for this band .",
    "more importantly , we find good agreement between the value of @xmath202 that may be obtained from this plot and the above estimate obtained from the ansatz wave function .    _ the @xmath203 bands .",
    "_ these bands , which contain no oscillator strength in the homogeneous limit , were not considered in ref .  .",
    "they may be treated in a way similar to the @xmath8 bands .",
    "if we focus on optimizing the ansatz at the bottom of the bands , we find @xmath204 for @xmath152 and that for this value the ansatz eq .",
    "( [ ansatz ] ) for @xmath188 indeed gives a good description of the numerically obtained lowest state . from eq .",
    "( [ complete_rotation ] ) and @xmath204 a value of @xmath205 can be estimated , which is seen to be in good agreement with the exact wave function plotted in fig .",
    "of course , the states in the @xmath203 bands exhibit a modulation of squared amplitudes inside each ring with four maxima .    _ the @xmath206 band .",
    "_ this band , too , has no oscillator strength . like the @xmath6 band ,",
    "the @xmath206 band is nondegenerate and is governed by a real hamiltonian .",
    "thus , @xmath207 and , like for the @xmath6 case , no optimization condition for @xmath208 has to be solved .",
    "figure 6(d ) gives the amplitude squared of the numerically obtained lowest state in this band , which exhibits no modulation inside rings ( the bloch factor is @xmath209 which gives unity upon taking the square ) .",
    "one does observe a vertical modulation with a high periodicity , which is due to the fact that for this band the lowest state is not the @xmath188 state , but rather a state that corresponds to a high value of @xmath55 .",
    "this is due to the fact that for this band the effective hamiltonian has dominant positive in stead of negative interactions .",
    "the important conclusion of the above analysis is that the bottom states in the @xmath6 and @xmath206 bands exhibit no chiral behavior ( no equal - intensity lines slanted relative to the @xmath23 axis ) , while the bottom states of the @xmath8 and the @xmath203 bands do show a chirality which , moreover , is very similar in magnitude as estimated by the number @xmath202 .",
    "if we now allow for weak disorder , mixing of the @xmath134 states within and between bands will occur .",
    "focusing on the bottom region of the density of states , we thus find that the wave functions in the homogeneous @xmath6 and @xmath206 bands will ( perturbatively ) acquire a slanted contribution as well . in view of the fact that the slant angle varies little inside as well as between the @xmath8 and @xmath203 bands ,",
    "we thus expect a similar slanting for all low - energy states at weak disorder .",
    "this is clearly confirmed by fig .  7 , where we presented the bottom states of the @xmath6 , 1 , 2 , and 3 bands weakly perturbed by the presence of a very small disorder strength of @xmath210 @xmath150 .",
    "if we further increase the disorder strength , the mixing will become nonperturbative and will also involve higher - lying states , described by different @xmath196 values and a different number of nodes in the vertical direction .",
    "these are the ingredients for the localization visible in fig .  5 ; however , the slanting of the autocorrelation function still clearly reflects the fact that locally the wave functions have a chirality that derives from the homogeneous states .",
    "the reason is that this chirality is mainly driven by the dominant transfer interactions , which occur over a few rings .",
    "in this paper we have theoretically investigated the effects of disorder on the linear optical properties and the localization behavior of the exciton states of cylindrical molecular aggregates . as specific example",
    ", we have used the structure for the cylindrical aggregates found in the light harvesting systems ( chlorosomes ) of green bacteria .",
    "we have calculated the absorption , ld , and cd spectra for various cylinder lengths in the presence of gaussian diagonal disorder , using both numerical simulations and the cpa . to this end",
    ", we modified the usual implementation of the cpa to account for finite - size effects ( open boundary conditions ) . by comparison to the simulation results",
    ", we have shown that this new implementation yields an excellent approximation , in fact significantly better than the usual cpa , which starts from periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we have shown that for the chlorosomes the inclusion of disorder improves the comparison to experiment in several respects .",
    "most importantly , however , the inclusion of disorder does not affect the main conclusion of ref .   that the cd spectrum has a strong size dependence up to cylinders of hundreds of rings long .",
    "we demonstrated and discussed that this effect occurs in spite of the fact that the exciton localization size is far smaller than the cylinder size .",
    "the localization behavior of the excitons was studied by examining two quantities : the participation ratio and an autocorrelation function of the exciton wave functions . while the former only yields an approximate measure for the number of molecules participating in the excitation , the latter gives additional information about the direction of localization on the cylinder . in the case of chlorosomes",
    ", we found that the excitons that dominate the optical properties ( the ones near the band bottom ) have a strongly anisotropic localization behavior , being extended mainly along helices , whose direction is dictated by the interplay of the various intermolecular excitation transfer interactions in the cylinder .",
    "as we have demonstrated , this chiral behavior finds its roots in the chirality of the fully extended exciton states for the homogeneous cylinder .",
    "both the participation ratio and the autocorrelation function show that , starting from the bottom of the exciton band , the exciton states become more extended with increasing energy ( both quantities give comparable values for the energy dependent localization size ) .",
    "also the chirality of the wave functions is energy dependent , but this effect is small .",
    "it is of interest to speculate whether the chiral nature of the wave functions could be detected in terms of a rotating polarization of the light emitted by an exciton while propagating .",
    "this would require single - aggregate experiments with high spatial resolution and a time - resolved detection.@xcite",
