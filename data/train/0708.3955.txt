    "<S> we report measurements of the evolution of lines , planes , and volumes in an intensely turbulent laboratory flow using high - speed particle tracking . we find that the classical characteristic time scale of an eddy at the initial scale of the object considered is the natural time scale for the subsequent evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the initial separation may only be neglected if this time scale is much smaller than the largest turbulence time scale , implying extremely high turbulence levels .    </S>",
    "<S> the transport of material by a carrier fluid is ubiquitous in both the natural world and in engineering applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the carrier flow is turbulent , the dispersion of the transported substance can be very rapid . </S>",
    "<S> turbulent flows are also extremely efficient at mixing @xcite , since their nonequilibrium nature drives the production of small scales and sharp gradients where diffusion can occur rapidly . to study both transport and mixing , </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to work in the lagrangian framework where the fundamental objects are the trajectories of individual fluid elements @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the trajectory of a single lagrangian particle is , in general , not sufficient for characterizing turbulent transport . instead , </S>",
    "<S> knowledge of the collective motion of groups of particles is required @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest such multiparticle quantity is the growth of the relative distance between a pair of particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have previously measured this relative dispersion @xcite , finding excellent agreement with batchelor s theoretical predictions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> geometrically , the two particles in relative dispersion define a line , and therefore a particle pair only gives one - dimensional information about turbulent dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> an even deeper understanding of turbulent transport requires the study of higher - dimensional structures : groups of three particles , which define a plane , and of four particles , which define a volume . </S>",
    "<S> while such structures have been considered before in models and numerical simulations @xcite and in low - reynolds - number experiments @xcite , they have not been investigated at the high reynolds numbers that are common in nature .    here , we present measurements of the shape dynamics of collections of lagrangian particles in an intensely turbulent laboratory water flow . </S>",
    "<S> we consider lines ( two particles ) , planes ( three particles ) , and volumes ( four particles ) . in all of these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the initial size of the object plays a strong role : the time scale determined by this initial size , which we denote by @xmath0 , characterizes the experimentally observed evolution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that two particles separate superdiffusively , as is well - known in turbulence , but that @xmath0 divides two types of separation behavior . </S>",
    "<S> triangles formed from three particles and volumes spanned by four particles also grow in time , but assume stationary shapes after @xmath0 , with triangles evolving to a preferred set of internal angles and volumes flattening into nearly planar structures .    </S>",
    "<S> our measurements are made using optical particle tracking @xcite in a swirling water flow between counter - rotating baffled disks , as described in detail elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the strength of the turbulence with the taylor - microscale reynolds number @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the root - mean - square velocity , @xmath3 is the correlation length of the velocity field , and @xmath4 is the kinematic viscosity ; here , we report measurements for @xmath5 as high as 815 . </S>",
    "<S> our polystyrene tracer particles are smaller than or comparable to the smallest scale of the turbulence , the kolmogorov length scale @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean rate of energy dissipation per unit mass , for all reynolds numbers studied , and faithfully follow the flow  @xcite . by modifying our tracking algorithms , </S>",
    "<S> we have been able to increase the lengths of measured trajectories significantly , allowing for the study of longer - time statistics @xcite .    , with a kolmogorov scale of @xmath8 @xmath9 m . </S>",
    "<S> we observe similar behavior at other reynolds numbers . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the change of @xmath10 with @xmath11 , shown for three reynolds numbers . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ] , with a kolmogorov scale of @xmath8 @xmath9 m . </S>",
    "<S> we observe similar behavior at other reynolds numbers . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the change of @xmath10 with @xmath11 , shown for three reynolds numbers . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig : \" ]    let us first consider one - dimensional shape changes by measuring the growth of the separation @xmath12 between two particles . for this case , </S>",
    "<S> the well - known richardson - obukhov law  @xcite predicts that @xmath13 in the inertial range , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the large - eddy turnover time . in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless coefficient @xmath17 , known as the richardson constant , is expected to be universal and independent of initial separation @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been notoriously difficult , however , to observe conclusive evidence of this @xmath19 scaling experimentally @xcite . in our previous measurements of relative dispersion @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we instead found that the initial separation of the pair @xmath18 plays an important role , as first suggested by batchelor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> he predicted that @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the scaling constant for the second - order eulerian velocity structure function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> batchelor additionally predicted that this scaling law should hold for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 may be regarded as the lifetime of an eddy of scale @xmath18 .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that the failure to observe the richardson - obukhov law is due to the influence of particle pairs that separate anomalously slowly or quickly , so that they bring in non - inertial - range effects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this will occur unless the inertial range is sufficiently wide and the effects of both the dissipation and integral scales are negligible , requiring very large reynolds numbers . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the finite measurement volume in experiments may introduce a bias against quickly separating particle pairs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore also measured @xmath25 , which is less affected by the finite - volume bias and may display scaling behavior at reynolds numbers accessible in current experiments  @xcite . if the richardson - obukhov law holds , then @xmath26 where @xmath10 should be a constant related to the richardson constant @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the compensated plot @xmath27 should collapse to a plateau in the inertial range , independent of initial separation @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : line](a ) , plateaus , though short , do exist for @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we find , however , that the initial separation @xmath18 again plays a role : @xmath0 is the time scale of the transition to the @xmath29 scaling and the plateau values depend on @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> these observations support our earlier argument that a very large separation between @xmath30 and @xmath0 ( corresponding to a very large reynolds number ) is required to observe @xmath18-independent richardson - obukhov scaling  @xcite , which is also supported by recent work using a stochastic model  @xcite . to quantify the effect , we plot in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : line](b ) the change of @xmath10 with @xmath31 at three different reynolds numbers , where @xmath10 is measured from the peak value in the plateau region of the compensated curves . </S>",
    "<S> the largest @xmath31 in this plot are taken from @xmath32 , the lower bound of the inertial range  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the measurements from three different reynolds numbers collapse very well , and that the @xmath18-independent region is not reached even at @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> the absence of richardson universal scaling law even at @xmath34 may be better understood from the evolution of @xmath35 , the relative velocity between fluid particles pairs . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : energy](a ) shows the change of the energy of relative motion , @xmath36 , following the pairs . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : energy](b ) shows the rate of the change , @xmath37 , following the pairs , where @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the energy of relative motion decreases initially before the final increase . as initial separation increases , </S>",
    "<S> the return to @xmath39 takes longer time . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are in good agreement with results numerical simulations  @xcite , where the same change of the energy of relative motion was found for a `` cloud '' of tracer particles . </S>",
    "<S> this initial decrease of relative motion energy can be linked to the large correlation length of forcing in three - dimensional turbulence  @xcite . in light of figure  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : energy ] , the relative motion between a pair of particles is first slowed down and it takes a time comparable to @xmath0 for the relative motion to accelerate again . the further apart the particles </S>",
    "<S> the longer the relative period of slow down is . only after the initial decreasing period </S>",
    "<S> , the richardson regime can possibly be observed .    </S>",
    "<S> while studying the two - particle case tells us how particles separate along lines in turbulence , groups of three particles can show richer dynamics since they form two - dimensional objects . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore measured the shape statistics of triangles formed from three particles . here </S>",
    "<S> we report only the statistics of triangles that were initially nearly equilateral . </S>",
    "<S> we then measured the growth of the sides the triangles , analogous to the evolution of the mean - squared separation of two particles considered above , and the distortion of the triangles , information that is unavailable from pair separation measurements .     </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath40 @xmath9 m ) , characterized by ( a ) the mean - squared lengths of the triangle edges and ( b ) the mean triangle angles . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 , the initial edge length , varies from 4 mm to 6 mm . as in the two - particle case , </S>",
    "<S> the data for different initial sizes collapse when time is scaled by @xmath0.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( @xmath40 @xmath9 m ) , characterized by ( a ) the mean - squared lengths of the triangle edges and ( b ) the mean triangle angles . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 , the initial edge length , varies from 4 mm to 6 mm . as in the two - particle case , </S>",
    "<S> the data for different initial sizes collapse when time is scaled by @xmath0.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure  [ fig : tri](a ) shows the evolution of the mean - squared lengths of the triangles @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) for three different initial triangle sizes . when time is scaled by @xmath0 , defined now with the side length of the initially equilateral triangles , the data collapse for different initial sizes . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , scaling in this fashion collapses data taken at different reynolds numbers ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that unlike the monotonic increase of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , there is initially a slight decrease in @xmath45 , an effect that is absent in the statistics of particle pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this result shows the importance of studying higher - dimensional structures in three - dimensional turbulence . we shall discuss this initial decrease in more detail when considering four - particle statistics below .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to a mean growth , three particles can assume nontrivial 2d configurations . to quantify these shapes </S>",
    "<S> , we show the evolution of the means of the three triangle angles @xmath46 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tri](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> just as for the edge lengths , the angle data collapse when time is scaled by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that our initially equilateral triangles become distorted over a time of order @xmath0 to stationary , obtuse shapes , with angles of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> these values appear to be independent of reynolds number : indeed , our observations are in agreement with earlier results from 3d numerical simulations @xcite and 2d experiments @xcite , even though they were performed at significantly lower reynolds number .     </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath8 @xmath9 m ) , characterized by ( a ) the mean eigenvalues of the inertia tensor scaled by the initial tetrad size and ( b ) the mean normalized eigenvalues for initial sizes ranging from 10 mm to 20 mm . </S>",
    "<S> once again , the data for different initial sizes collapse when time is scaled by @xmath0.,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( @xmath8 @xmath9 m ) , characterized by ( a ) the mean eigenvalues of the inertia tensor scaled by the initial tetrad size and ( b ) the mean normalized eigenvalues for initial sizes ranging from 10 mm to 20 mm . once again </S>",
    "<S> , the data for different initial sizes collapse when time is scaled by @xmath0.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the evolution of triangles has given us more insight into transport than the two - particle case , but for 3d turbulence , we must consider volumes for a full characterization . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore consider groups of four particles , the minimum number of points required to define a volume . such groups form `` tetrads , '' which have previously been used to construct a stochastic model of the coarse - grained velocity gradient tensor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following chertkov _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we characterize the spatial arrangement of the particles with the eigenvalues @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 ) of the `` inertia '' tensor @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the column vectors of the tensor @xmath53 are defined based on the relative separation between the four points : @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the position of the @xmath57 lagrangian particle . </S>",
    "<S> the volume of the tetrad is given by @xmath58 , and its radius of gyration is @xmath59 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also define normalized eigenvalues @xmath60 to describe the tetrad shape : @xmath61 defines an isotropic tetrad , @xmath62 means that the four points are coplanar , and @xmath63 means that they are collinear . as with the triangles studied above , we considered only tetrads that were initially nearly isotropic , with the length of all edges within 10% of a nominal size @xmath18 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tetrad](a ) , we show the evolution of the tetrad eigenvalues scaled by the initial tetrad size . </S>",
    "<S> data for different initial sizes collapse when time is scaled by @xmath0 , as it would for different reynolds numbers . here , it is clear that while the two larger eigenvalues increase monotonically , the smallest eigenvalue decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this observation provides direct experimental evidence for earlier theoretical and numerical work  @xcite that in 3d turbulence the large - scale , coarse grained strain - rate tensor has , on average , two positive eigenvalues and one negative eigenvalue . </S>",
    "<S> the negative eigenvalue causes the initial compression in one direction , and consequently the decrease in @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized eigenvalues , shown in fig .  [ fig : tetrad](b ) , also collapse for different sizes when scaled by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the tetrads develop towards a nearly planar configuration after a time of order @xmath0 . within the experimental resolution </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the stationary values of the normalized eigenvalues to be @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( note that @xmath67 ) , similar to our earlier results where we did not select only the initially nearly isotropic tetrads @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that we did not observe a richardson - like @xmath68 for any reynolds number or initial size accessible .    </S>",
    "<S> our results are qualitatively similar to the recent numerical simulations of lagrangian tetrads in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , performed at @xmath69 , where stationary values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 were reported , indicating an even stronger tendency towards planar tetrads than in our data . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : shapepdf ] , we show the evolution of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the smallest shape factor @xmath72 following lagrangian tetrads . </S>",
    "<S> again , the evolution of the pdfs are consistent with simulation results in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for tetrads with initial separation in the dissipative range . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that after @xmath73 ( or approximately @xmath0 ) , the pdfs are still slowly evolving . beyond that time </S>",
    "<S> , the tetrads , on average , have been swept away from their initial positions by half of the size of the measurement volume and disappear from our observation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our measurement of @xmath74 might be affected by the finite measurement volume . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , it is more probable for a vertex of an extremely deformed tetrad to move out of the finite measurement volume . </S>",
    "<S> there is hence a potential bias towards smaller deformation in our experiments .    a possible reason for the slight difference between the simulation and experimental results could be the higher potentiality for a vertex of an extremely deformed tetrad to move out of the finite measurement volume of our experiments , at which point the tetrad would no longer be detectable . </S>",
    "<S> there is therefore a potential bias towards smaller deformation in our experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the initial size of the tetrads studied in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are in the dissipation range ( @xmath75 ) , whereas our smallest initial separation was @xmath76 , well into the inertial range . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the initial decrease in @xmath77 , similar to that shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tetrad](a ) , was attributed to dissipative effects , which were also presumed to be responsible for the lack of observed richardson scaling . </S>",
    "<S> since we observed very similar behavior with @xmath18 well in the inertial range , however , we attribute the lack of @xmath19 scaling to a small separation between @xmath0 and @xmath30 , just as for the case of pair separation . </S>",
    "<S> the correspondence between our inertial - range results and the smaller - scale numerical results suggests additionally that the statistics of the coarse - grained velocity gradient tensor @xcite may be very similar to those of the true velocity gradient . </S>",
    "<S> further study of these similarities will be an excellent opportunity to bring together complementary experiments and numerical simulations .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : volume ] shows the change of averaged volume following the tetrads with different sizes . the tetrads volume remains constant initially for time @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> then decreases in volume before the final increase . </S>",
    "<S> this decrease was not observed in previous numerical work  @xcite and experimental measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a possible reason is that the tetrad sizes are large enough to feel the effect of the mean strain .    in summary , we have measured multiparticle lagrangian statistics in an intensely turbulent laboratory flow . </S>",
    "<S> we studied the evolution of lines , planes , and volumes , each parameterized by the minimum number of lagrangian points . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in three - dimensional turbulence , material volumes tend to flatten into planar shapes , in agreement with previous numerical and experimental studies at much lower reynolds numbers . </S>",
    "<S> our results clearly indicate that the initial particle separation is an important parameter in each of these cases and must be included in models . only when the ratio of the largest turbulence time scale and the time scale based on the initial size of the object is very large , implying a very large reynolds number , may the initial size be safely neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank l.  collins , g.  falkovich , z.  warhaft , and in particular a.  pumir for many helpful discussions and suggestions . </S>",
