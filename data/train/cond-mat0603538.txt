    "the effects of time - modulated fields on the quantum transport have been of continued interest in the recent past .",
    "these time - modulated fields can be transversely polarized@xcite , longitudinally polarized@xcite , or represented by time - modulated potentials , with no polarization@xcite .",
    "the systems recently considered are mostly mesoscopic systems , such as the narrow constrictions@xcite . for the case",
    "when a constriction is acted upon by an incident electromagnetic wave , the time - modulated field has a polarization .",
    "this situation can be realized experimentally , as is demonstrated by two latest experiments@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the time - modulated potentials are expected to be realized in gate - voltage configurations@xcite , which is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the presence of the time - modulated fields , with or without polarizations , gives rise to coherent inelastic scatterings .",
    "these inelastic scatterings do not conserve the longitudinal momentum along the transport direction , as long as the time - modulated fields have finite longitudinal ranges .",
    "the reason being that the finiteness in the range of the fields breaks the translational invariance @xcite . furthermore , the inelastic scattering processes induced by these time - modulated fields depend also on the polarization of the fields . in an adiabatically varying constriction , the inelastic scattering processes involve inter - subband transitions , when the time - modulated fields are transversely polarized , but involve only intra - subband transitions , when the fields do not have polarizations , such as those arise from time - modulated gate - voltages",
    ". the detail transport characteristics of the constriction hence depend on the polarization of the time - modulated fields .    in this work we focus on the case of a time - modulated potential .",
    "the effect of such a potential on the transport properties of one dimensional systems have been investigated in many previous works@xcite .",
    "however , the possible manifestation of quasi - bound - state ( qbs ) features has not been widely recognized , except for the work of bagwell and lake @xcite , who have considered a time - dependent potential that has a delta profile .",
    "the energy of this qbs is below , but close to , the band bottom of the one dimensional system .",
    "the transport exhibits qbs feature when the conducting electrons can make transitions via inelastic processes to the qbs .",
    "we expect this qbs feature to be more significant in a narrow constriction than in a one dimensional system , because there are , in a constriction , more subbands and hence more qbs s .",
    "furthermore , the tunability of the subband structures and the chemical potential together provide greater feasability for probing the qbs feature in narrow constrictions .    in an earlier work@xcite",
    ", the present authors have investigated the effect of a time - dependent gate potential acting upon the uniform - width region of a narrow constriction . for those electrons that manage to enter the narrow channel region from the two end - electrodes",
    ", they have perfect transmission , and the time - modulated potential can not further increase the dc conductance . instead , the potential causes backscattering , and leads to lower dc conductances .",
    "hence it is not unexpected that the dc conductance is found to exhibit only gate - voltage - suppressed and not gate - voltage - assisted feature@xcite . as the chemical potential @xmath3 increases ,",
    "the suppressed feature in the dc conductance is characterized by dip structures at which @xmath3 is @xmath4 above the threshold energy of a subband .",
    "these dip structures are associated with the formation of qbs at a subband bottom in the narrow channel due partly to the singular density of states ( dos ) .",
    "it is interesting to see whether such qbs feature persists in systems that have large but not singular dos , and to explore cases that may have gate - voltage - assisted feature .",
    "these questions motivate us to study a saddle - point constriction in the presence of a time - modulated gate - voltage .",
    "a few interesting issues are addressed .",
    "first of all , the effective dos in a saddle - point constriction is not singular .",
    "this is because the singularity in the dos of a narrow channel comes from both the one - dimensionality and the sharp threshold energy of each subband . in a saddle - point constriction ,",
    "the threshold energy of each subband is not sharp but is smeared by tunneling processes that occur near the threshold .",
    "the robustness of the qbs feature against the absence of a singular dos is explored .",
    "second , the gate - voltage covers regions in which the effective width of the constriction is varying .",
    "the gate - voltage - assisted processes become possible , which should be sensitive to the range of the gate - voltage .",
    "these range - dependent characteristics are studied .",
    "third , the system can easily be configured into an asymmetric situation by shifting the center of the gate - voltage away from the symmetric center of the saddle - point constriction .",
    "the effect of this asymmetry is studied .    in sec .",
    "ii we present our method . in sec .",
    "iii we present some numerical examples .",
    "a conclusion is presented in sec .",
    "choosing the energy unit @xmath5 , the length unit @xmath6 , the time unit @xmath7 , and @xmath8 in units of @xmath9 , the dimensionless schrdinger equation for such saddle - point constriction becomes @xmath10\\,\\psi(\\vec{x},t).\\ ] ] here @xmath11 is a typical fermi wave vector of the reservoir and @xmath12 is the effective mass .",
    "the transverse energy levels @xmath13 are quantized , with @xmath14 being the corresponding wave functions . the time - modulated gate - voltage @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 where the interaction region is centered at @xmath17 and with a longitudinal range @xmath18 . even though the saddle - point constriction is symmetric",
    ", the transport characteristics could become asymmetric if the interaction region were not centered at the symmetric center of the constriction .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath15 we considered is uniform in the transverse direction and it does not induce intersubband transitions .",
    "thus for a @xmath19th subband electron , and with energy @xmath3 , incident along @xmath20 , the subband index @xmath19 remains unchanged and the scattering wave function can be written in the form @xmath21 .    the wave function @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of the unperturbed wave functions @xmath23 which satisfy the schrdinger equation @xmath24\\psi(x,\\mu_{n})=\\mu_{n}\\psi(x,\\mu_{n}),\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the energy for the motion along @xmath20 .",

    "rather , the electron suffers additional reflection from the gate - voltage after tunneling through the constriction .",
    "however , for an electron incident from the right hand side , it can receive assistance from the gate - voltage when passing through the constriction .",
    "of course , the electron might be reflected by this gate - voltage as well .",
    "but in the opening up of a new gate - voltage - assisted transmission channel , when the electron , after absorbing @xmath4 , can propagate , rather than tunneling , through the constriction , the assisted feature dominates .",
    "this example , though not a generic one , illustrates that the difference between the current transmission coefficients originates from the different extent the time - modulated gate - voltage involves in assisting the transmitting electrons .",

    ", @xmath0 increases gradually , rather than abruptly , when a channel , after picking up an energy @xmath2 , becomes propagating .",
    "this is because the range of the interacting region does not cover far enough so that the electron , though having the right energy , has to tunnel to the interacting region first before being assisted .",
