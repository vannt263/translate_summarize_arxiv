    "the riemann hypothesis is considered the most important problem in analytic number theory @xcite .",

    "hilbert and plya suggested long ago that the rh can be proved if one finds a self - adjoint linear operator whose eigenvalues are the riemann zeros @xcite .",
    "the first indication of the adecuacy of this conjecture was probably the work by selberg in the 1950s , who found a remarkable duality between the eigenvalues of the laplacian acting on riemann surfaces of constant negative curvature and the length spectrum of their geodesics @xcite .",
    "selberg trace formula , which establishes that link , strongly resembles riemann explicit formula .",
    "another important hint came in 1973 from montgomery s work who , assuming the rh , showed that the riemann zeros are distributed according to the gaussian unitary ensemble statistics of random matrix models @xcite .",
    "montgomery s results , were confirmed by the impressive numerical findings obtained by odlyzko in the 1980 s @xcite .",
    "the next step in this direction was put forward by berry who proposed the quantum chaos conjecture , according to which the riemann zeros are the spectrum of a hamiltonian obtained by quantization of a classical chaotic hamiltonian , whose periodic orbits are labelled by the prime numbers @xcite .",
    "this suggestion was based on analogies between fluctuation formulae in number theory and quantum chaos @xcite .",

    "berry and keating suggested in 1999 that the 1d classical hamiltonian @xmath0 is related to the riemann zeros @xcite .",
    "this suggestion was based on a heuristic and semiclassical analysis which yields , rather surprisingly , the average number of riemann zeros up to a given height .",
    "unfortunately , this encouraging result does not have a quantum counterpart .",
    "more explicitely , it is not known a quantization of @xmath0 yielding the average , or exact , position of the riemann zeros as eigenvalues .",
    "the berry - keating papers were inspired by an earlier one from connes who tried to prove the rh in terms of the mathematical structures known as adeles and p - adic numbers @xcite . in order to illustrate the adelic approach ,",
    "connes introduced the hamiltonian @xmath3 , using a different semiclassical regularization . in connes",
    "s approach the riemann zeros appear as missing spectral lines in a continuum , which does not conform to the berry - keating s approach where the riemann zeros appear as discrete spectra .",
    "both approaches are heuristic and semiclassical , therefore the apparent contradiction between them can not be resolved until one derives a consistent quantum theory of @xmath0 , and its possible extensions .    in reference @xcite we proposed a quantization of @xmath0 using an unexpected connection of this model to the one - body version of the so called russian doll bcs model of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the latter model was , in turn , motivated by previous papers on the renormalization group with limit cycles @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath0 and the russian doll ( rd ) model is as follows .",
    "an eigenstate , with energy @xmath4 , of a quantum version of the classical hamiltonian @xmath0 , corresponds to a zero energy eigenstate of the rd hamiltonian , where @xmath4 becomes a coupling constant .",
    "since the rd model is exactly solvable @xcite , so it is the @xmath0 model .",
    "the spectrum obtained in this way was shown to agree with connes s picture of a continuum of eigenstates @xcite .",
    "we also obtained the smooth part of the riemann formula for the zeros , however this fact can not be interpreted as missing states but rather as a blueshift of energy levels .",
    "a point like spectrum associated to the riemann zeros was completely absent in this quantization of @xmath0 .",
    "the final conclusion of @xcite was the necessity to go beyond the @xmath0 model , in order to realize an spectral interpretation of the riemann zeros .",
    "some proposals were already made in that reference but the corresponding models could not be solved exactly .",
    "the cyclic renormalization group , and its realization in the field theory models of references @xcite , is at the origin of leclair s approach to the rh @xcite . in this reference",
    "the zeta function on the critical strip is related to the quantum statistical mechanics of non - relativistic , interacting fermionic gases in 1d with a quasi - periodic two - body potential .",
    "this quasi - periodicity is reminiscent of the zero temperature cyclic rg of the quantum mechanical hamiltonian of @xcite , but the general framework of both works is different .",
    "the cyclic rg underlies several of the results of the present paper , but we shall not deal with it in the rest of the paper .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section",

    "in this paper we have proposed a possible realization of the hilbert - plya conjecture in terms of a hamiltonian given by a perturbation of @xmath3 , or rather its inverse @xmath268 , by means of an antisymmetric matrix parameterize by two potentials @xmath41 and @xmath48 .",
    "the schrdinger equation can be reduced to a first order differential equation , suplemented with boundary conditions , which are exactly solvable in terms of a jost function . in this respect ,",
    "our approach is essentially different from the second order approaches to the rh based on standard qm .",
    "the generic spectrum consists in a continuum of eigenenergies which may contain a point like spectra embbeded in it .",
    "we have studied a variety of examples showing that the existence of a point like spectrum depends `` critically '' on the values of the coupling constants of the model .",
    "we have found the potentials whose resonances approach the smooth riemann zeros asymptotically . in the classical limit these potentials reproduce the berry - keating semiclassical regularization of @xmath0 . implementing a discrete dilation symmetry on the previous potentials , we have obtained a jost function which , in the asymptotic limit , resembles the two - variable euler - zagier zeta function @xmath254 with @xmath259 .",
    "the real part of this jost function vanishes at the riemann zeros but not necessarily its imaginary part .",
    "these results were derived from a trivial potential @xmath269 , and they suggest that a non trivial choice of @xmath48 , could yield a jost function directly related to the zeta function .",
    "a natural candidate is @xmath270 , with @xmath271 , which has the correct analiticity properties .",
    "if these potentials do exist , then the riemann zeros would become bound states of the model and the rh would follow automatically .",
    "this is how the hilbert - plya conjecture would come true in our approach .",
