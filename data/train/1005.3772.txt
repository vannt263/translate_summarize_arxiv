    "therefore , a direct application of the modern pdf sets @xcite to the lhc processes is not well justified .",
    "this problem is really important , because the larger uncertainties for many processes at the lhc originate mainly from our restricted knowledge of the parton distributions ( see , for example , the recent paper @xcite and references therein ) .    in the present paper",
    "we propose an idea to overcome this problem .",
    "our solution consists of the two basic steps .",
    "firstly , we find asymptotics of solutions of the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equations @xcite for the parton densities at low and large @xmath1 values of the bjorken variable and , at the next step , we approach a combination of the two solutions for the full range of @xmath1 .    in a sense , this is not a new idea .",
    "a similar approach had been given by the spanish group ( see book @xcite and references therein ) about 40 years ago .",
    "however , in the present paper the parametrization will be constructed in a rather different way .",
    "in particular , it includes an important subasymptotic term which is fixed exactly by the sum rules .",
    "the results of the present paper are restricted by the leading order ( lo ) of the perturbation expansion , what is reasonable @xcite , since for many processes at the lhc the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) corrections are not known so far . moreover , in the present study we limit ourselves to the valence quarks , whose evolution does not contain contributions from the gluons .",
