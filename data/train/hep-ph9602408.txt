    "recent studies in quenched lattice qcd @xcite have led to a considerable advance in our understanding of meson wave functions - in particular , of the relation between the bethe - salpeter wavefunction of a heavy - light meson in coulomb gauge qcd and the wavefunctions obtained from a spinless relativistic quark model ( srqm ) defined by a hamiltonian of the form @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a constituent quark mass , and @xmath2 the confining potential ( determined by monte carlo measurements of wilson line correlations of static color sources ) .",
    "wave functions obtained from ( [ eq : h1 ] ) have proved to be enormously useful in constructing appropriately smeared lattice operators for heavy - light mesons [ 1 ] , leading to accurate lattice calculations of b - meson properties .",
    "they have also been recently applied to the extraction of the isgur - wise function @xcite .",
    "relativistic potential models have also been used to estimate pseudoscalar meson decay constants @xcite    despite the fact that srqm wavefunctions give a vastly better fit than nonrelativistic ones to the meson wavefunctions measured in monte carlo calculations , some persistent discrepancies in simultaneously describing the asymptotic ( large distance ) behavior as well as the wavefunction at the origin suggest that the model defined by eq([eq : h1 ] ) is not capturing all of the essential physics , even at the level of a valence quark description .",
    "recall that the srqm of ( [ eq : h1 ] ) has only a single free parameter , the constituent quark mass @xmath1 , as the potential @xmath2 is determined by monte carlo measurements for each lattice studied .",
    "these discrepancies are not very important in constructing smeared operators for the ground state meson in each angular momentum channel , but become very troublesome when one tries to extract excited state properties using the multistate formalism of ref@xcite , where admixtures of the ground state should be kept to a minimum .",
    "our objective in this paper is not only to construct an improved version of the srqm which does a better job in fitting the global behavior of meson wavefunctions for different angular momenta and for small as well as large distance , but also to provide a clear explanation of the approximations being done and the relation of the resulting model with a hypothetical full qcd solution of the problem .    the resulting model extracts , we believe , the full content of the physical picture provided by the valence quark description and consistent with qcd .",
    "the accurate predictions for the wave functions as compared to monte carlo simulations ( see section 3.1 ) indicates that heavy - light mesons can be represented reasonably well in terms of this picture .",
    "the two main effects which emerge from the more complete treatment given in sections 2 and 3 below of the lattice qcd coulomb gauge hamiltonian , and which are found to improve considerably the agreement of the model with the measured monte carlo wavefunctions are    1 .",
    "a renormalization of the wilson r - parameter away from the bare value ( r=1 ) used in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the sign of this lattice effect can be understood already from the one - loop seagull correction ( see section 2.1 ) , although the magnitude ( as in the case of the quark mass correction renormalizing @xmath3 ) seems to involve a large nonperturbative piece .",
    "this is reasonable , since a renormalization of r is an effect involving _ all _ momenta , in particular low momenta where we know perturbation theory fails .",
    "also , one must keep in mind that a one - loop calculation in the 4-dimensional euclidean theory ( with @xmath4 ) , will not necessarily give the correct quantitative shift of the spatial r - parameter in the hamiltonian formulation ( where a continuum limit @xmath5 has implicitly been taken ) . + this effect , which should became irrelevant in the continuum limit , plays however an important quantitative role improving the agreement between model and data for the lattice sizes tested so far ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "2 .   some of the observed discrepancies between model @xmath6 and the monte carlo simulations persist , even after the corrections implied in point 1 .",
    "these remaining discrepancies are considerably reduced when the correct relativistic treatment of the heavy - light system is performed .",
    "a detailed analysis of the differences between this correct treatment and the previous models give rise to a beautiful explanation of this new corrections .",
    "they turn out to be due to the delocalization of the light quark known as zitterbewegung , that , as is well known , arise from the inability to localize a relativistic particle in a local unitary theory . to my knowledge , these effects are seen for the first time in monte carlo measured wave functions .    in section 2 ,",
    "we construct a model that correctly takes into account the wilson lattice fermionic kinetic energy @xcite used in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "this model however does not represent an improvement over @xmath6 .",
    "the reason for that is analyzed and as a result a new model arises , incorporating the renormalization of the wilson @xmath7-parameter , that does represent an improvement over ( [ eq : h1 ] ) . in section 2.2 we compare this new model and @xmath6 with the monte carlo data . in section 3",
    "we carry out a fully relativistic treatment of the problem . in section 3.1 this model",
    "is compared with the monte carlo data . in section 4",
    "we compare the physical content of the three models and interpret the differences . in section 5",
    "we present the conclusions and discuss upcoming studies .",
    "as was shown in refs . @xcite , the hamiltonian given by equation ( [ eq : h1 ] ) describes very well the results of monte carlo calculations of the coulomb gauge wave functions of a heavy - light meson in quenched approximation .",
    "in addition to practical implications for lattice studies , this model provides a surprisingly simple physical picture for the heavy - light mesons , namely , the heavy quark acting as a source of the confining coulomb potential and the light quark moving relativistically in this confining field ( the relativistic nature of the kinetic energy was essential @xcite in reproducing the large distance behavior of the wave function ) .",
    "the real gluons are completely decoupled from the quarks except for their role renormalizing the mass .    in this paper",
    ", we will carry the physical picture implied by a valence quark model to its limits .",
    "the resulting model highly improves the one given by eq.([eq : h1 ] ) both conceptually and in its predictive power while keeping the underlying simplicity .      a first , perhaps obvious modification to @xmath6 amounts to replacing the kinetic energy by the lattice wilson dispersion relation @xcite taking correctly into account the specific lattice formulation employed in the simulations .",
    "it is important in assessing the quantitative validity of the relativistic quark model that systematic effects due to lattice discretization be dealt with consistently both in the model and in the monte carlo simulations so that deviations between the two may be properly attributed to important physical effects rather than lattice artifacts which will eventually disappear in the continuum limit .",
    "the monte carlo calculations @xcite that constitute the ` experimental ' data were done with a wilson @xmath7 parameter equal to one .",
    "so our new hamiltonian becomes : @xmath8 where @xmath9    although this model is closer to lattice qcd since it contains the correct dispersion relation , the corresponding wave functions _ do not _ represent an improvement with respect to model ( [ eq : h1 ] ) .",
    "actually , they magnify the discrepancies between model @xmath6 and monte carlo data .",
    "this is at first sight very surprising because , as already said , eq([eq : hr1 ] ) is closer to lattice qcd in its treatment of the fermionic kinematics than @xmath6 .",
    "the solution to this puzzle comes from a detailed analysis of the renormalization of the parameters of the theory _ on the lattice_.    more specifically , consider the one loop contribution to the quark self energy . on the lattice",
    "we have _ two _ graphs rather than one ( as a consequence of the compact representation of the gauge field ) :    to    corresponding to : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "graph ( b ) also appears in the continuum while graph ( a ) is present only on the lattice in a compact formulation of the gauge theory .",
    "it is precisely graph ( a ) that will provide in the cleanest way the solution to our puzzle , as its contribution to the self energy in coulomb gauge is : @xmath13   ( r \\cos{p_0 } - i \\gamma_0 \\bar{p}_0 )   + \\\\ \\label{gluons }   & & g^2 { ( n^2 - 1)\\over 4n } \\sum_{i = 1}^3 \\left [ { 1\\over\\omega }   \\sum_k   { 1\\over   \\hat{k}_{\\mu}^2 }   ( 1 - { \\hat{k}_i^2",
    "\\over | \\hat{k}_j^2| } ) \\right ] ( r \\cos{p_i } - i \\gamma_i \\bar{p}_i ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , greek indices run from 1 to 4 and roman indices from 1 to 3 ( this convention applies in all equations in this paper ) .",
    "eq([coulomb])contains the contribution from the coulombic instantaneous interaction while eq([gluons ] ) contains the contributions from the real gluons .",
    "writing @xmath15 as @xmath16 , the inverse free propagator becomes @xmath17 and we immediately realize that the part of @xmath18 proportional to the identity matrix ( in the dirac indices ) explicitly renormalizes the wilson @xmath7 parameter . specifically :    @xmath19   \\right\\ }   \\\\ \\label{rspace } r_{{\\rm space } } & \\rightarrow   & r   \\left\\ { 1 -   g^2 { ( n^2 - 1)\\over 4n }   \\left [ { 1\\over\\omega }   \\sum_k   { 1\\over   \\hat{k}_{\\mu}^2 }   ( 1 - { \\hat{k}_i^2 \\over | \\hat{k}_j^2| } )   \\right ]   \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for our lattice size , the perturbative @xmath7 renormalization due to graph ( a ) are , in coulomb gauge : @xmath20    we shall be comparing rqm models with montecarlo data generated on a 12@xmath21x24 lattice at @xmath225.7 , corresponding to a naive bare lattice coupling @xmath23 1.05 .",
    "the hopping parameter was @xmath24 0.168 .",
    "nonperturbative effects may partially be included by using instead the tadpole - improved @xcite definition of the coupling , which gives for the @xmath25 value considered a value closer to 2.9 for @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this is the value used in eqs([deltartime],[deltarspace ] ) .    in our hamiltonian models we consider of course only @xmath27 .",
    "this value , as we will see in the next subsection correctly predict the sign of the change in @xmath7 although the magnitude seems to have big nonperturbative contributions .",
    "graph ( b ) also contributes _ effectively _ to the @xmath7 renormalization , but not in an explicit way as in the case of the first one .",
    "however , in this case the numerical contribution is much smaller ( as in the case of the mass shift ) .",
    "of course the mass is also renormalized as is well known , and also by an amount which is quite a bit larger than the perturbative one - loop shift ( even with tadpole improved couplings ) .",
    "the important point of this calculation is to realize that _ not only the mass but also the wilson @xmath7 parameter should be considered as free parameters , since both of them are dynamically modified , in a nonperturbative way_.    including this effect , the model acquires the same form as in eq([eq : hr1 ] ) @xmath28 but with @xmath29 we have now therefore _ two _ adjustable parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath7 .",
    "this new model , with correctly chosen values for the parameters , represents a substantial quantitative improvement over model ( [ eq : h1 ] ) as will be shown in the next section .",
    "we also understand now why eq.([eq : hr1 ] ) actually works worse than eq([eq : h1 ] ) , as @xmath6 is _ effectively _ close ( in the sense that the fermionic kinetic dispersion relation is close to the bosonic one over most lattice momenta ) to one particular case of the model @xmath30 . in fact , it corresponds , for fixed @xmath1 , to @xmath31 as can be seen simply by plotting the corresponding dispersion relations .",
    "this value , although not optimal , is closer to the optimal choice for model ( [ eq : h2 ] ) ( see section 2.2 ) than the naive unrenormalized choice @xmath32 .",
    "the improvement obtained with eq ( [ eq : h2 ] ) , although very significant from a quantitative point of view for the lattice sizes tested so far , should nevertheless become irrelevant in the continuum limit , although it is certainly relevant in providing accurately smeared meson operators for multistate montecarlo studies @xcite .    in any case , we have now not only a better model but one that has a closer connection to qcd since it contains the actual _ dynamical _ qcd fermionic kinetic energy .",
    "we shall see in the next section that the modification in the dispersion formula greatly improves the fit to the measured wavefunctions at shorter distance ( and in particular at the origin ) once the @xmath1 and @xmath7 parameters are chosen to optimize the fit at medium and large distances .",
    "a fuller description , starting with the bethe - salpeter equation ( which for a light quark propagating in the color field of a static source reduces to a dirac equation ) will lead in section ( 3 ) to a model giving similar wavefunctions , agreeing even more closely with the measured ones .",
    "such a model represents a valence quark description of the heavy - light meson that is as close to qcd as possible without leaving the physical picture outlined in the introduction .      in order to actually solve for the wave functions of the model",
    ", we used the same method as in refs @xcite .",
    "we briefly explain it here for completeness .",
    "the procedure used in a multistate smearing calculation of heavy - light meson properties @xcite for generating lattice smearing functions from the rqm is as follows .",
    "one obtains orthonormal lattice wavefunctions , which are eigenstates of a lattice rqm hamiltonian defined on a @xmath33 lattice ( with @xmath34 lattice sites ) :    @xmath35    the eigenstates in a channel of given orbital quantum numbers ( s , p , d etc ) are obtained by applying the resolvent operator @xmath36 to a source wavefunctions of the same orbital symmetry .",
    "the model at this stage is spinless ( the measured wavefunctions represent spin - averages of the top two dirac components of the light quark field ) so issues of spin - orbit coupling do not yet arise ( they will be dealt with properly in the full dirac formalism of section 3 ) .    in the resolvent approach ,",
    "s - states are generated by applying the resolvent kernel to a monopole localized at the origin , p - states with a source dipole , and so on . at each trial value of the energy @xmath37",
    ", the norm of the resulting state @xmath38 is evaluated .",
    "obviously @xmath39 when @xmath40 .",
    "typically , wavefunctions accurate to 4 - 5 significant figures are obtained by stopping once this norm exceeds 3000 . at this point a smearing eigenstate @xmath41 is extracted by renormalizing the vector @xmath38 to unit norm .",
    "the inversion of @xmath42 is performed by the conjugate gradient algorithm , with the multiplication of the kinetic term done in momentum space using a fast fourier transform .    in the following figures we present the results of our new model as compared with the old one .",
    "as was already mentioned in the previous section , the montecarlo data presented in the foolowing figures was generated on a 12@xmath21x24 lattice at @xmath225.7 , and the hopping parameter was @xmath24 0.168 .    in fig[[fig :",
    "s1l12 ] ] we compare the ground state wave functions for the @xmath43 case .",
    "the values chosen for the constituent mass and @xmath7 parameters are chosen to maximize the agreement ( in a mean square sense ) between data and the respective models _ in the ground state_. as it turned out , the optimum constituent masses are very similar to one another and the wave functions very insensitive to small changes around the optimum value .",
    "we present here the results for the same values of the constituent mass .",
    "this choice , while essentially identical to the optimum cases , helps to appreciate the effect of the r renormalization .",
    "the case of @xmath30 with @xmath44 is also included to emphasize the effect of the @xmath7 renormalization . as we can see , the agreement with the monte carlo data was already very good for @xmath6 and is further improved , specially at the origin by @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath45    but the most important reason for which model @xmath30 was introduced , was to capture the lattice artifacts unavoidably present in the monte carlo data . only after these artifacts are",
    "well under our control can we hope to find some physics in the data beyond the one provided by @xmath6 . in this sense",
    "the improvement at the origin is due to the @xmath7 renormalization as can be seen by comparing with the unrenormalized case denoted @xmath30 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 also we present in fig[[fig : s1l12detail ] ] a detail of fig[[fig : s1l12 ] ] corresponding to the region of distances between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "specifically , as can be seen in fig[[fig : s1l12 ] ] , at points corresponding to distances @xmath50",
    "( this corresponds to the lattice points @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 ( corresponding to the point @xmath53 and the points generated by cyclic permutation of the coordinates ) , there is a pronounced ` discontinuity ' in the monte carlo data that should of course disappear in the continuum limit . on a finite lattice and still not very close to the continuum",
    "this discontinuity is easy to understand qualitatively : it is due to the fact that under these conditions the system responds more naturally in terms of a metric notion of distance between two points on a lattice given by some function of the number of links between these points ( notice that @xmath54 is at 3 links away from the origin while @xmath55 is only at 2 , in contradistinction with their euclidean distance ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : s1l12detail ] we see how model @xmath6 completely ignores this lattice artifact , @xmath30 with @xmath56 is slightly closer , while @xmath30 with @xmath57 follows almost perfectly the discontinuity .",
    "@xmath58    in fig[[fig : s1l12larger ] ] we can better appreciate the large distance region .",
    "@xmath59    in fig[[fig : logs1l12 ] ] , we show the same information as in fig[[fig : s1l12 ] ] but in logarithmic scale to appreciate the asymptotic region . as we see , both , @xmath6 and @xmath30 with renormalized @xmath7 do a very good job in this region .",
    "@xmath60    so , as we have seen , as far as the ground state is concerned , @xmath30 not only shows an improvement over @xmath30 specially visible at the origin , but it also proved capable of capturing very pronounced lattice artifacts .",
    "both effects clearly show the relevance of taking into account the @xmath7 renormalization .",
    "once the values of @xmath1 and @xmath7 are specified to reproduce as accurately as possible the ground state , we compare now the results for the 1p state . in this case , we divide the respective wave functions by @xmath61 to show only the radial dependence . as we can see in fig[[fig : p1l12 ] ] , the model @xmath30 does again a better job than @xmath6 , although there is still room to improve .",
    "the case of @xmath30 with @xmath56 is not shown since it was in the previous figures only to see the effect of renormalizing @xmath7 . in any case , it again performs worse than @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath62    so we conclude that , although the modifications leading to @xmath30 are only due to lattice artifacts , the quantitative improvement is significant , so the value of @xmath30 resides in the fact that it captures a very important lattice discretization effect .",
    "nevertheless the improved model is still conceptually and quantitatively inadequate .",
    "the conceptual inadequacy stems from the fact that the relation between the eigenstates of @xmath30 and the spin - averaged bethe - salpeter wavefunctions in coulomb gauge is unclear ( e.g. the potential model ignores antiquarks whereas there are coupled upper and lower components in a dirac formalism ) .",
    "quantitatively , we shall see that use of a full dirac formalism which is closely related to the bethe - salpeter wavefunction also further improves the agreement with the monte carlo results . in this full formalism",
    ", it will still be important however to include the @xmath7-renormalization discussed above .",
    "as we have seen , the agreement between the wavefunctions derived from the hamiltonian @xmath30 and the monte carlo data is quite remarkable ; however , not only is there still room for further quantitative improvement but from a conceptual point of view the connection between these simple models and a full hypothetical qcd solution of the meson coulomb gauge wave functions is not completely clear . in another words , it would be nice to have a model that works as well as the previous one and in which the nature of the approximations being done is completely transparent . in this subsection",
    "we will construct this model and as a bonus the resulting one will show an additional quantitative improvement over @xmath30 with a very nice physical interpretation .",
    "we shall assume that : + ( a ) transverse gluon interactions with the quarks act primarily to renormalize the mass and r parameters in the quark kinetic term .",
    "fock states involving real gluons in addition to the valence quarks are neglected .",
    "+ ( b ) the net effect of coulomb gluon exchange between the light and static quarks can be expressed by the potential acting between two infinitely heavy color sources .",
    "more qualitatively , the picture in the back of our mind , supported by the comparison with data as will be seen in section ( 3.1 ) , consists of the light quark moving fast enough for relativistic effects to be important , but on the other hand not so fast that the interaction with the static quark can not be accurately described by the energy which would obtain if the light quark were held fixed .",
    "alternatively , one might assume that the time scales over which the string connecting the quark to the static source responds to changes in the light quark position are small compared with the time scales relevant for the light quark motion .",
    "before we proceed with the derivation of our new model , it will be useful to present a brief description of what was actually measured in the monte carlo simulations of ref@xcite that constitutes our data .",
    "even though this work used a sophisticated multistate smearing method , for our purposes it suffices to know that the basic information was extracted from the measurement , in quenched lattice qcd , of the green function : @xmath63 in the limit were the b - quark is taken to be infinitely massive . in this limit , the heavy quark propagator is simply proportional to @xmath64 , therefore @xmath65 becomes proportional to the average of the upper two components of the light quark propagator in the presence of a color source . from the calculation of this object , using the above mentioned multistate smearing method ( i.e. smearing the source point @xmath66 of the light quark with ansatz meson wavefunctions derived from @xmath6 ) the upper two components of the meson wave function were extracted and spin averaged .",
    "the result of this operation constitutes the data against which we compare our models .    taking this into account",
    "we will now construct a model that represents as closely as possible the quantities measured in the monte carlo simulations realizing at the same time the physical ideas presented above .    in a full qcd treatement of the problem at hand",
    ", the relevant bethe - salpeter wavefunction would be @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the vacuum , @xmath69 is the meson state ( in the center of mass frame with energy @xmath70 ) , and @xmath71 are the light and heavy heisenberg fields .    in the infinitely massive heavy quark limit , but otherwise still in full qcd , eq.([eq : fullbs ] )",
    "is best written as , @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "this notation emphasizes the fact that in the above limit , the heavy quark field is not dynamical .    as we see",
    ", if we were able to calculate exactly eq.([eq : bsheavym ] ) in the context of heavy quark limit quenched lattice qcd , we would be reproducing every detail of the results of the monte carlo simulations , since that is precisely the quantity being measured .    in our physical picture however , as stated above the transverse gluon interactions with the quarks act primarily to renormalize the mass ( and in the lattice also the wilson @xmath7 parameter ) in the quark kinetic term and the net effect of coulomb gluon exchange between the light and static quarks can be expressed by the potential acting between two infinitely heavy color sources . under these conditions",
    "the equation satisfied by @xmath74 reduces to : @xmath75 that together with the heisenberg equation @xmath76}$ ] ( in euclidean space ) and the relation @xmath77|p * \\rangle = -e_{bs}\\langle0|q_h|p * \\rangle$ ] , give rise to the eigenvalue equation @xmath78 which is nothing but the dirac equation for the light quark in the presence of the confining external field .",
    "this equation corresponds , on the lattice , ( with the renormalization of the wilson @xmath7 parameter also taken into account ) to an effective lattice hamiltonian given by the usual wilson fermion action : @xmath79    \\nonumber   \\\\   &    &   - \\frac{r}{2 }     \\sum_{k=1}^{3 } [ \\chi^{+ } ( { \\bf x } + \\hat{\\bf k } )    \\ ; \\beta \\ ; \\chi ( { \\bf x } ) + \\chi^{+}({\\bf x } ) \\ ; \\beta \\ ; \\chi ( { \\bf x } + \\hat{\\bf k } ) ]   \\nonumber    \\\\    &    &   +   \\chi^{+ } ( { \\bf x})\\ ; v({\\bf x } ) \\ ; \\chi ( { \\bf x } ) \\ } \\label{eq : h3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 represents a point in the three dimensional lattice of size @xmath81 , @xmath25 and @xmath82 are just the dirac matrices , @xmath83 is the 4-component wave function , and @xmath84 is the confining potential determined by monte carlo measurements of wilson line correlations of static color sources @xcite .",
    "the constituent mass @xmath1 and the wilson @xmath7 parameters are free parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath85 defines our new model . from the above discussion",
    "we realize it represents the closest possible model to qcd consistent with the valence quark picture whose validity in the heavy - light meson system we want to check .    as will be shown in section ( 3.1 ) this new model represents a further improvement in the prediction of the correct wave functions , that by now are , within the errors of the monte carlo calculations , essentially fully reproduced , indicating the validity of the valence quark model to describe heavy - light mesons .",
    "given the necessary assumptions to generate this picture from qcd ( stated above ) , the strong coupling nature of the confining mechanisms , and the lightness of one of the quarks clearly reflected in the necessity of a fully relativistic kinetic energy , the success of the model can hardly be expected a priori , and constitutes a strong statement about qcd dynamics .      to find numerically the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath85 , although we followed in general the same procedure outlined in section(2.2 ) , some features of @xmath85 had to be taken into account .",
    "for example , due to the non - positivity of the spectrum , the inversion of @xmath86 was performed with a generalization of the conjugate gradient algorithm , the so called _ minimum residual algorithm _",
    "@xcite , that takes care of symmetric but non - positive definite matrices ( one may replace the @xmath87 complex hermitian @xmath85 with a real symmetric @xmath88 version , which is however non - positive - definite ) . to locate the correct region of the spectrum we started in the large mass regime where",
    "the wavefunctions are well understood and gradually reduced the mass while tracking the resulting eigenstates .    in the following figures we present the results of our new model and compare them with the monte carlo data and the predictions of @xmath30 .",
    "the values of the parameters are chosen again to reproduce as well as possible the ground state of the system .",
    "following as closely as possible what was done in the monte carlo simulations , ( briefly described in section 3 ) , the results of @xmath85 presented in the figures , constitute the average of the two upper components of the corresponding four - component eigenvectors .",
    "@xmath89    in fig[[fig:1sl12mcvsdvsrqm ] ] we see that our new model performs as well as @xmath30 for the ground state , where there was essentially no room for further improvement .",
    "we should however note that while the optimum value for @xmath7 in @xmath85 suffers only a small change with respect to the one in @xmath30 , the optimum mass becomes considerably heavier .",
    "once the parameters have been fixed to reproduce as well as possible the ground state of the system , we may compare the 1p state .",
    "again , as in the previous figures for 1p wave functions , we divide them by @xmath61 and present only the radial part . in this case",
    "we clearly see the quantitative superiority of @xmath85 over the previous models .",
    "near the origin @xmath85 falls much closer to the data than @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath90    we see then that choosing the optimal parameters for the respective models , a full dirac model based on the operator @xmath85 ( that , as we have seen in section 3 is conceptually as close to lattice qcd as possible within the valence quark model ) , outperforms all the other models and within monte carlo errors essentially fully reproduces the data .",
    "we had also available the energies of the 1s and 2s states for the monte carlo data , obtained from the multistate smearing analysis of @xcite .",
    "the only meaningful comparison is between energy differences since there is an arbitrary choice in deciding the zero energy of the potential @xmath2 .",
    "the respective energy differences between 1s and 2s states are presented in table 1 .",
    "[ tab : scales ]    [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the next section we will discuss the nature of the improvement of @xmath85 with respect to the previous models .",
    "in order to fully appreciate the nature of the quantitative improvement given by our new model , we will now compare it with the previous ones .",
    "an obvious difference between the model given by eq.([eq : h3 ] ) and those described by equations ( 1 ) and ( [ eq : h2 ] ) is that the former takes into account spin effects .",
    "the monte carlo wavefunctions with which we have tested the model were in fact spin - averaged , but @xmath85 contains in principle a full description of spin - orbit effects .",
    "what follows is a comparison of the models at the spin - averaged level .",
    "the montecarlo wavefunctions obtained in heavy - light simulations are typically obtained by averaging the two upper components of the light quark propagator on the final time slice .",
    "that is why we have performed the same averaging when computing a meson wavefunction from the new rqm .    expressing the kinetic part of the hamiltonian @xmath85 in momentum space",
    ", we get , @xmath91 with @xmath92    observing eq.([eq : h3kin ] ) and eq.([eq : h2 ] ) , we realize that a meaningful comparison requires expressing the dirac - wilson hamiltonian of eq.([eq : h3 ] ) in a representation in which the kinetic energy acquires the form of the kinetic energy piece of eq.([eq : h2 ] ) . in the continuum",
    "this representation exists and is given by the well known free foldy - wouthuysen ( fw ) transformation @xcite . by this we mean a transformation where the dirac field is rotated by the unitary transformation which decouples upper and lower components in the _ absence _ of interactions .",
    "of course , the full foldy - wouthuysen transformation performs this decoupling including the interaction with the external field order by order in the inverse quark mass .",
    "however , we wish to avoid a large mass expansion for light quarks , and an  all - orders \" version of the fw transformation is not known explicitly .",
    "nevertheless , the relation between models @xmath30 and @xmath85 can still be clarified by a partial fw transformation in which upper and lower components are decoupled in the kinetic term only . on the lattice",
    "the corresponding representation goes along the same lines as in the continuum .",
    "we then write    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is a unitary ( but nonlocal ) operator . in momentum space , if we choose @xmath94 according to ( see [ 4 ] )    @xmath95\\ ] ]    where @xmath96 is given by eq.([eq : h3kinq ] ) , @xmath97 are the dirac gamma matrices , and @xmath98 after this transformation , the kinetic part of @xmath85 becomes @xmath99 where @xmath100 , with @xmath101 and @xmath102 given by ( [ eq : h3kinmass ] ) and ( [ eq : h3kinq ] ) , and @xmath103 . in ref @xcite , a lattice foldy - wouthuysen transformation is also being considered .",
    "so now , both models have the same kinetic part and the difference between them becomes completely transparent .",
    "namely , while the model of eq.([eq : h2 ] ) has ( in coordinate space ) a potential energy of the form :    @xmath104    the potential energy of the model @xmath85 becomes after the foldy - wouthuysen transformation of eqs ( [ eq : h3prime]-[eq : sineteta ] ) :    @xmath105 [   \\cos \\theta _ { \\bf p } - { \\vec{\\gamma } \\cdot \\vec{p } \\over |\\vec{p}| }   \\sin \\theta_{\\bf p } ] \\ }     \\psi(\\vec{y } )    \\label{eq : h3primepot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as can be seen simply by expressing the fields @xmath106 and @xmath107 in terms of @xmath108 and @xmath109 through @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "comparing eqs ( [ eq : h2pot ] ) and ( [ eq : h3primepot ] ) and taking into account the definitions of @xmath112 and @xmath113 given by eqs ( [ eq : costeta ] ) and ( [ eq : sineteta ] ) , we see that ( [ eq : h3primepot ] ) reduces to ( [ eq : h2pot ] ) in the @xmath114 limit , in which @xmath115 and @xmath116 and therefore @xmath117    it is worth looking at the above limit in more detail . expanding the product between brackets in eq([eq : h3primepot ] ) and remembering that @xmath118 , we obtain @xmath119 \\ }     \\psi(\\vec{y } )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath120    to interpret these terms it is convenient to consider their continuum limit . in this limit ,",
    "eq([eq : costeta ] ) and ( [ eq : sineteta ] ) become : @xmath121 and the interactions corresponding to the three terms above become :    @xmath122 \\ }     \\psi(\\vec{y } )      \\\\ \\label{eq : coulomb } & = &   \\int_{\\vec{x } }   \\psi^+ ( \\vec{x } ) v(\\vec{x } ) \\psi(\\vec{x } )      \\\\ \\label{eq : darwin } & + &   \\frac{1}{8 m^2 } \\int_{\\vec{x } }   \\psi^+ ( \\vec{x } ) \\nabla^2 v(\\vec{x } ) \\psi(\\vec{x } )    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    term ( [ eq : coulomb ] ) represents the electrostatic energy of a point - like particle and is the one present in models @xmath6 and @xmath30",
    ". more interestingly , term ( [ eq : darwin ] ) corresponds to exactly the darwin term .",
    "it arises because of zitterbewegung , as can be seen from the smearing of the potential ( see eqs([eq : h3primepotf123 ] ) and ( [ eq : f1 ] ) ) .",
    "@xmath123 \\ }    \\psi(\\vec{y } )      \\\\ & = & \\int_{\\vec{z } }    \\psi^+ ( \\vec{z } ) \\",
    "{    \\int_{\\vec{x},\\vec{y } } \\int_{\\vec{p } , \\vec{q } }   e^{i \\vec{q } ( \\vec{z } - \\vec{x } ) } e^{i \\vec{p } ( \\vec{x } - \\vec{y } ) }   v(\\vec{x } )    \\nonumber \\\\ &    & \\mbox { }    [   i   \\epsilon_{ijk }   \\pmatrix { \\sigma^k & 0 \\cr 0 & \\sigma^k \\cr } \\frac { { \\bf q}_i   { \\bf p}_j } { 4 m^2 }     ] \\ }    \\psi(\\vec{y } )      \\\\ \\label{eq : spinorbit } & = &   - \\frac{i}{4 m^2 } \\int_{\\vec x }   \\psi^+ ( \\vec{x } )   \\epsilon_{ijk }   { \\partial \\over \\partial x_i}\\{{{v({\\vec x } ) } } \\pmatrix { \\sigma^k & 0 \\cr 0 & \\sigma^k \\cr }   { \\partial \\over \\partial x_j } \\psi(\\vec{x } ) \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have used the identity @xmath124 , where the @xmath125 are the pauli matrices .",
    "clearly eq([eq : spinorbit ] ) represents the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "finally we have :    @xmath126   \\ }    \\psi(\\vec{y } )    \\\\ \\label{eq : partantipart } & = &   \\frac{i}{2 m }   \\int_{\\vec{x } }   \\psi^+ ( \\vec{x } ) \\ { { \\partial \\over \\partial x^i}{v(\\vec{x } ) }   \\gamma^i \\ }   \\psi(\\vec{x})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    representing interactions between upper and lower components of the dirac spinor . in a large mass expansion ( the usual fw transformation )",
    "this term is removed by a unitary rotation at order @xmath127 .",
    "it is perhaps worth mentioning that ignoring this term completely ( clearly valid for large masses only ! ) but _ not making the large mass expansion _ in ( [ eq : h3primef1 ] , [ eq : h3primef2 ] ) and spin - averaging the resulting hamiltonian , yields a modified potential model which we have studied and which yields wavefunctions very close to the full dirac formalism .",
    "this approximation is not very well motivated however , as it seems to involve a rather inconsistent treatment in terms of a @xmath128 development .",
    "in retrospect we realize that potential model descriptions based on @xmath6 and @xmath30 are somewhat inconsistent since , as we have just seen , they effectively take the limit @xmath129 in the potential part while keeping a finite mass in the kinetic part ( as first shown in ref @xcite , the full relativistic kinetic energy is essential in reproducing the data ) . the reasonably good agreement between @xmath6 , @xmath30 and the monte carlo data ,",
    "together with the inconsistency pointed out above , deserves some comments .",
    "the validity of @xmath85 , as clearly stated in section 3 , is based on the assumption that , even though the light quark moves fast enough for relativistic effects to be important , the time scales over which , the string connecting the quark to the static source responds to changes in the light quark position , are small compared with the time scales relevant for the light quark motion .",
    "this makes the interaction between the light and the static quark well described by the energy which would obtain if the light quark were held fixed .",
    "models @xmath6 and @xmath30 , effectively taking the limit @xmath129 in the potential part and keeping a finite mass in the kinetic part , are simply making the further assumption that the confining potential is essentially constant over regions of size of the order of the light quark compton wave - length . to see this implication we just have to remember that a dirac particle does not move along a straight line with constant velocity but instead carries out an oscillatory motion ( zitterbewegung ) with the speed of light ( see @xcite ) centered on a point which does move uniformly .",
    "this oscillatory motion is of the order of the compton wavelength of the particle . as our light quark moves though the confining potential ,",
    "its color charge explores then the field over a region of the order of its compton wavelength and this explains the appearance of the darwin term and all higher order terms familiar from the f - w transformation .",
    "however if over regions of the order of the compton wavelength the field is slowly varying , it may be reasonable to ignore the smearing effects ( formally higher order in @xmath128 ) while maintaining the relativistic kinematics in the kinetic term .",
    "this seems to be the case in our situation in which , as can be seen from the reasonable success of models @xmath6 and @xmath30 , taking the @xmath129 limit in the potential part seems not to be a very bad thing to do ( for example , at larger light quark masses than those studied here , the agreement between the wavefunctions generated from @xmath30 and @xmath85 is closer ) .",
    "however were we going to do the same in the kinetic part , we would get a non - relativistic model that does a very bad job at reproducing the wave functions @xcite .    in any case",
    ", the most important lesson that we learn from the discussion above is that the differences that we saw in the previous section between the wave functions of model 2 and those of model 3 are , as we have just seen , the result of well known effects that arise when one combines quantum mechanics and relativity , which model 3 captures ( to the extent that the dirac equation captures them ) , but are ignored in models 1 and 2 .",
    "these effects are to our knowledge visible for the first time in the context of quantitatively measured ( in quenched lattice qcd ) strong interaction wavefunctions .",
    "we have presented the results for the 1s and 1p wave functions and energy differences between the 1s and 2s states of a fully relativistic lattice model of heavy - light mesons .",
    "these results were compared with monte carlo measurements of the corresponding quantities and with previous models .",
    "the results of the comparison validated the valence quark model as a good representation of heavy - light mesons , at least for the lattice sizes tested so far .",
    "in particular our fully relativistic model proved quantitatively as well as qualitatively superior to previous models .",
    "the quantitative improvement represented by our model arose simply by comparison with the data .",
    "the qualitative one came not only from the relative transparency of the approximations being done , clearly stated in the derivation of the model ; a comparison of the physical content of the different models revealed that the previous ones were somewhat inconsistent in their relative treatment of the potential and kinetic terms .",
    "it is precisely this comparison that allows a physical interpretation of the quantitative improvements of the fully relativistic models . as it turned out they",
    "can be thought of as due to darwin and higher order effects ( in the language of a foldy - wouthuysen treatment ) arising from the quantum - relativistic delocalization of the light quark due to zitterbewegung .",
    "it is remarkable that the monte carlo simulations of ref @xcite are now accurate enough to capture this phenomenon .",
    "we expect to be able to extend the above results to much larger lattices .",
    "we are currently generalizing this work to treat mesons with two finite mass quarks .",
    "if the fully relativistic model continues to be as quantitatively accurate as the results obtained here suggest it may turn out to be a very useful tool in the study of the spectrum and static properties of charmonium and charmed and b - mesons .",
