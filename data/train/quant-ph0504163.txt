    "the concept of _ entanglement _ has played a crucial role in the development of quantum physics . in the early days entanglement",
    "was mainly perceived as the qualitative feature of quantum theory that most strikingly distinguishes it from our classical intuition .",
    "the subsequent development of bell s inequalities has made this distinction quantitative , and therefore rendered the non - local features of quantum theory accessible to experimental verification @xcite .",
    "bell s inequalities may indeed be viewed as an early attempt to quantify the quantum correlations that are responsible for the counterintuitive features of quantum mechanically entangled states . at the time it was almost unimaginable that such quantum correlations could be created in well controlled environments between distinct quantum systems .",
    "however , the technological progress of the last few decades means that we are now able to coherently prepare , manipulate , and measure individual quantum systems , as well as create controllable quantum correlations . in parallel with these developments ,",
    "quantum correlations have come to be recognized as a novel resource that may be used to perform tasks that are either impossible or very inefficient in the classical realm .",
    "these developments have provided the seed for the development of modern quantum information science .",
    "given the new found status of entanglement as a resource it is quite natural and important to discover the mathematical structures underlying its theoretical description .",
    "we will see that such a description aims to provide answers to three questions about entanglement , namely ( 1 ) its characterisation , ( 2 ) its manipulation and , ( 3 ) its quantification .    in the following we aim to provide a tutorial overview summarizing results that have been obtained in connection with these three questions .",
    "we will place particular emphasis on developments concerning the _ quantification _ of entanglement , which is essentially the theory of _ entanglement measures_. we will discuss the motivation for studying entanglement measures , and present their implications for the study of quantum information science .",
    "we present the basic principles underlying the theory and main results including many useful entanglement monotones and measures as well as explicit useful formulae .",
    "we do not , however , present detailed technical derivations .",
    "the majority of our review will be concerned with entanglement in bipartite systems with finite and infinite dimensional constituents , for which the most complete understanding has been obtained so far .",
    "the multi - party setting will be discussed in less detail as our understanding of this area is still far from satisfactory .",
    "it is our hope that this work will give the reader a good first impression of the subject , and will enable them to tackle the extensive literature on this topic .",
    "we have endeavoured to be as comprehensive as possible in both covering known results and also in providing extensive references .",
    "of course , as in any such work , it is inevitable that we will have made several oversights in this process , and so we encourage the interested reader to study various other interesting review articles ( e.g. @xcite ) and of course the original literature .",
    "* _ what is entanglement ?",
    " _ * any study of entanglement measures must begin with a discussion of what entanglement _ is _ , and how we actually _ use _ it . in the following",
    "we will adopt a highly operational point of view .",
    "then the usefulness of entanglement emerges because it allows us to overcome a particular constraint that we will call the _ locc constraint _ - a term that we will shortly explain .",
    "this restriction has both technological and fundamental motivations , and arises naturally in many explicit physical settings involving quantum communication across a distance .",
    "we will consider these motivations in some detail , starting with the technological ones . in any quantum communication experiment",
    "we would like to be able to distribute quantum particles across distantly separated laboratories .",
    "perfect quantum communication is essentially equivalent to perfect entanglement distribution .",
    "if we can transport a qubit without any decoherence , then any entanglement shared by that qubit will also be distributed perfectly .",
    "conversely , if we can distribute entangled states perfectly then with a small amount of classical communication we may use teleportation @xcite to perfectly transmit quantum states . however , in any forseeable experiment involving these processes , the effects of noise will inevitably impair our ability to send quantum states over long distances .",
    "one way of trying to overcome this problem is to distribute quantum states by using the noisy quantum channels that are available , but then to try and combat the effects of this noise using higher quality local quantum processes in the distantly separated labs .",
    "such local quantum operations ( ` lo ' ) will be much closer to ideal , as they can be performed in well - controlled environments without the decoherence induced by communication over long - distances .",
    "however , there is no reason to make the operations of separated labs totally independent .",
    "classical communication ( ` cc ' ) can essentially be performed perfectly using standard telecom technologies , and so we may also use such communication to coordinate the quantum actions of the different labs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the ability to perform classical communication is vital for many quantum information protocols - a prominent example being teleportation .",
    "these considerations are the technological reasons for the key status of the _ local operations and classical communication _ ` locc ' paradigm , and are a major motivation for their study .     in a standard quantum communication setting two parties",
    "alice and bob may perform any generalized measurement that is localized to their laboratory and communicate classically .",
    "the brick wall indicates that no quantum particles may be exchanged coherently between alice and bob .",
    "this set of operations is generally referred to as locc.,width=302 ]    however , for the purposes of this article , the fundamental motivations of the locc paradigm are perhaps more important than these technological considerations .",
    "we have loosely described entanglement as the _ quantum correlations _ that can occur in many - party quantum states .",
    "this leads to the question - how do we define quantum correlations , and what differentiates them from _ classical correlations _ ?",
    "the distinction between ` quantum ' effects and ` classical ' effects is frequently a cause of heated debate .",
    "however , in the context of quantum information a precise way to define classical correlations is via locc operations .",
    "classical correlations can be defined as those that can be generated by locc operations .",
    "if we observe a quantum system and find correlations that can not be simulated classically , then we usually attribute them to quantum effects , and hence label them _ quantum correlations _",
    "so suppose that we have a noisy quantum state , and we process it using locc operations . if in this process we obtain a state that can be used for some task that can not be simulated by classical correlations , such as violating a bell inequality , then we must not attribute these effects to the locc processing that we have performed , but to quantum correlations that were _ already present _ in the initial state , even if the initial state was quite noisy .",
    "this is an extremely important point that is at the heart of the study of entanglement .",
    "it is the constraint to locc - operations that elevates entanglement to the status of a resource . using locc - operations as the only other tool",
    ", the inherent quantum correlations of entanglement are required to implement general , and therefore nonlocal , quantum operations on two or more parties @xcite . as locc - operations alone are insufficient to achieve these transformations , we conclude that entanglement may be defined as the sort of correlations that may not be created by locc alone .",
    "allowing classical communication in the set of locc operations means that they are not completely local , and can actually have quite a complicated structure . in order to understand this structure more fully , we must first take a closer look at the notion of general quantum operations and their formal description .    * _ quantum operations  _ * in quantum information science much use is made of so - called ` generalised measurements ' ( see @xcite for a more detailed account of the following basic principles ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that such generalised measurements do not go beyond standard quantum mechanics . in the usual approach to quantum evolution ,",
    "a system is evolved according to unitary operators , or through collapse caused by projective measurements .",
    "however , one may consider a more general setting where a system evolves through interactions with other quantum particles in a sequence of three steps : ( 1 ) first we first add ancilla particles , ( 2 ) then we perform joint unitaries and measurements on both the system and ancillae , and finally ( 3 ) we discard some particles on the basis of the measurement outcomes .",
    "if the ancillae used in this process are originally uncorrelated with the system , then the evolution can be described by so - called _",
    "kraus operators_. if one retains total knowledge of the outcomes obtained during any measurements , then the state corresponding to measurement outcomes @xmath0 occurs with probability @xmath1 and is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the initial state and the @xmath4 are matrices known as _",
    "operators ( see part ( a ) of fig . [ fig1 ] for illustration ) .",
    "the normalisation of probabilities implies that kraus operators must satisfy @xmath5 . in some situations , for example when a system is interacting with an environment , all or part of the measurement outcomes might not be accessible . in the most extreme case this corresponds to the situation where the ancilla particles are being traced out .",
    "then the map is given by @xmath6 which is illustrated in part ( b ) of fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) .     schematic picture of the action of quantum operations with and without sub - selection ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) respectively ) shown in part ( a ) and part ( b ) respectively . , width=283 ]    such a map is often referred to as a _ trace preserving _ quantum operation , whereas operations in which measurement outcomes are retained are sometimes referred to as _ measuring",
    "_ quantum operations ( or sometimes also _ selective _ quantum operations , or _ stochastic _ quantum operations , depending upon the context ) .",
    "conversely , it can be shown ( see e.g. @xcite ) that for _ any _ set of linear operators @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8 we can find a process , composed of the addition of ancillae , joint unitary evolution , and von - neumann measurements , that leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . in trace",
    "preserving operations the @xmath7 should strictly all be matrices of the same dimensions , however , if knowledge of outcomes is retained , then different @xmath7 may have different dimensions .",
    "having summarized the basic ingredients of generalised quantum operations , we are in a position to consider approaches that may be taken to determine which operations are implementable by locc . the locc constraint is illustrated in figure [ fig2 ] . in general this set of operations is quite complicated .",
    "alice and bob may communicate classically before or after any given round of local actions , and hence in any given round their actions may depend upon the outcomes of previous measuring operations . as a consequence of this complexity ,",
    "there is no known simple characterisation of the locc operations .",
    "this has motivated the development of larger classes of operations that can be more easily characterised , while still retaining a considerable element of locc - ality .",
    "one of the most important such classes is the set of _",
    "separable operations_. these are the operations that can be written in terms of kraus operators with a _ product _",
    "decomposition : @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "clearly , any locc operation can be cast in the form of separable operation , as the local kraus operators corresponding to the individual actions of alice and bob can be joined into product kraus operators .",
    "however , it is remarkable that the converse is _ not _ true .",
    "this was first demonstrated in @xcite , where an example task of a separable operation is presented that can not be implemented using locc actions - the example presented there requires a finite amount of quantum communication to implement it , even though the operation is itself separable .",
    "it is nevertheless convenient from a mathematical point of view to work with separable operations , as optimising a given task using separable operations provides strong bounds on what may be achieved using locc .",
    "sometimes this process can even lead to tight results - one may try to show whether the optimal separable operation may in fact be also implemented using locc , and this can often , but not always , be guaranteed in the presence of symmetries ( see e.g. @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "even more general classes of operations such as positive partial transpose preserving operations ( ppt ) such that @xmath11 is also completely positive , where @xmath12 corresponds to transposition of _ all _ of bob s particles , including ancillas .",
    "one can also consider transposition only of those particles belonging to bob that undergo the operation @xmath13 .",
    "however , we believe that this does not affect the definition .",
    "it is also irrelevant whether the transposition is taken over alice or bob , and so one may simply assert that @xmath14 must be completely positive , where @xmath15 is the transposition of one party .",
    "it can be shown that the ppt operations are precisely those operations that preserve the set of ppt states .",
    "hence the set of non - ppt operations includes any operation that creates a free ( non - bound ) entangled state out of one that is ppt .",
    "hence ppt operations correspond to some notion of locality , and in contrast to separable operations it is relatively easy to check whether a quantum operation is ppt @xcite . ]",
    "may also be used in the study of entanglement as they have the advantage of a very compact mathematical characterization @xcite .",
    "after this initial discussion of quantum operations and the locc constraint we are now in a position to consider in more detail the basic properties of entanglement .",
    "* _ basic properties of entanglement  _ * following our discussion of quantum operations and their natural constraint to local operations and classical communication , we are now in a position to establish some basic facts and definitions regarding entangled states . given the wide range of tasks that exploit entanglement one might try to define entanglement as ` that property which is exploited in such protocols ' .",
    "however , there is a whole range of such tasks , with a whole range of possible measures of success .",
    "this means that situations will almost certainly arise where a state @xmath16 is better than another state @xmath17 for achieving one task , but for achieving a different task @xmath17 is better than @xmath16 .",
    "consequently using a task - based approach to quantifying entanglement will certainly not lead to a single unified perspective .",
    "however , despite this problem , it is possible to assert some general statements which are valid regardless of what your favourite use of entanglement is , as long as the key set of ` allowed ' operations is the locc class .",
    "this will serve us a guide as to how to approach the quantification of entanglement , and so we will discuss some of these statements in detail :    @xmath18 _ separable states contain no entanglement . _",
    "a state @xmath19 of many parties @xmath20 is said to be _ separable _",
    "@xcite , if it can be written in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a probability distribution",
    ". these states can trivially be created by locc - alice samples from the distribution @xmath22 , informs all other parties of the outcome @xmath0 , and then each party @xmath23 locally creates @xmath24 and discards the information about the outcome @xmath0 .",
    "as these states can be created from scratch by locc they trivially satisfy a local hidden variables model and all their correlations can be described classically .",
    "hence , it is quite reasonable to state that separable states contain no entanglement .",
    "@xmath18 _ all non - separable states allow some tasks to be achieved better than by locc alone , hence all non - separable states are entangled . _",
    "for a long time the quantum information community has used a ` negative ' characterization of the term entanglement essentially defining entangled states as those that can not be created by locc alone . on the other hand",
    ", it can be shown that a quantum state @xmath25 may be generated perfectly using locc if and only if it is separable .",
    "of course this is a task that becomes trivially possible by locc when the state @xmath25 has been provided as a non - local resource in the first place .",
    "more interestingly , it has been shown recently that for any non - separable state @xmath25 , one can find another state @xmath26 whose teleportation fidelity may be enhanced if @xmath25 is also present @xcite .",
    "this is interesting as it allows us to positively characterize non - separable states as those possessing a useful resource that is not present in separable states .",
    "this hence justifies the synonymous use of the terms _ non - separable _ and _",
    "entangled_.    @xmath18 _ the entanglement of states does not increase under locc transformations .",
    "_    given that by locc we can only create separable , ie non - entangled states , this immediately implies the statement that locc can not create entanglement from an unentangled state .",
    "indeed , we even have the following stronger fact .",
    "suppose that we know that a quantum state @xmath25 can be transformed with certainty to another quantum state @xmath26 using locc operations .",
    "then anything that we can do with @xmath26 and locc operations we can also achieve with @xmath25 and locc operations . hence the utility of quantum states can not increase under locc operations @xcite , and one can rightfully state that @xmath25 is at least as entangled as @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath18 _ entanglement does not change under local unitary operations .",
    "_    this property follows from the previous one because local unitaries can be inverted by local unitaries .",
    "hence , by the non - increase of entanglement under locc , two states related by local unitaries have an equal amount of entanglement .",
    "@xmath18 _ there are maximally entangled states . _    now we have a notion of which states are entangled and are also able , in some cases , to assert that one state is more entangled than another .",
    "this naturally raises the question whether there is a _ maximally entangled state _",
    ", i.e. one that is more entangled than all others . indeed , at least in two - party systems consisting of two fixed @xmath27-dimensional sub - systems ( sometimes called qudits ) ,",
    "such states exist .",
    "it turns out that any pure state that is local unitarily equivalent to @xmath28 is maximally entangled .",
    "this is well justified , because as we shall see in the next subsection , any pure or mixed state of two @xmath27-dimensional systems can be prepared from such states with certainty using only locc operations .",
    "we shall later also see that the non - existence of an equivalent statement in multi - particle systems is one of the reasons for the difficulty in establishing a theory of multi - particle entanglement .",
    "+    the above considerations have given us the extremes of entanglement - as long as we consider locc as our set of available operations , separable states contain zero entanglement , and we can identify certain states that have maximal entanglement .",
    "they also suggest that we can impose some form of ordering - we may say that state @xmath25 is more entangled than a state @xmath26 if we can perform the transformation @xmath29 using locc operations .",
    "a key question is whether this method of ordering gives a partial or total order ? to answer this question we must try and find out when one quantum state may be transformed to another using locc operations .",
    "before we move on to the discussion of entanglement measures we will consider this question in more detail in the next part .",
    "note that the notion that ` _ entanglement does not increase under locc _ ' is implicitly related to our restriction of quantum operations to locc operations - if other restrictions apply , weaker or stronger , then our notion of ` more entangled ' is likely to also change .",
    "_ * manipulation of single bi - partite states  * _ in the previous section we indicated that for bi - partite systems there is a notion of maximally entangled states that is independent of the specific quantification of entanglement .",
    "this is so because there are so - called _ maximally entangled states _ from which all others can be created by locc only ( at least for bipartite systems of fixed maximal dimension ) .",
    "we we will show this explicitly here for the case of two qubits and leave the generalization as an exercise to the reader . in the case of two qubits , we will see that the maximally entangled states are those that are local - unitarily equivalent to the state @xmath30 our aim is now to justify this statement by showing that for any bipartite pure state written in a schmidt decomposed form ( see discussion around equation ( [ schmidt ] ) for an explanation of the schmidt decomposition ) : @xmath31 we can find a locc map that takes @xmath32 to @xmath33 with certainty . to this end we simply need to write down the kraus operators ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) of a valid quantum operation .",
    "it is easy to show that the kraus operators defined by @xmath34 satisfy @xmath35 and @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 .",
    "it is instructive to see how one can construct this operation physically using only locc transformations .",
    "let us first add an ancilla in state @xmath38 to alice which results in the state @xmath39 if we then perform the local unitary operation @xmath40 on alice s two particles , we arrive at @xmath41 finally , a local measurement on alice s ancilla particle now yields two outcomes . if alice finds @xmath38 then bob is informed and does not need to carry out any further operation",
    "; if alice finds @xmath42 then bob needs to apply a @xmath43 operation to his particle . in both cases",
    "this results in the desired state @xmath44 .",
    "given that we can obtain with certainty any arbitrary pure state starting from @xmath32 , we can also obtain any mixed state @xmath25 .",
    "this is because any mixed state @xmath25 can always be written in terms of its eigenvectors as @xmath45 for some set of unitaries @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( this in turn is simply a consequence of the schmidt decomposition ) .",
    "it is an easy exercise , left to the reader , to construct the operation that takes @xmath32 to @xmath25 .",
    "a natural generalisation of this observation would be to consider locc transformations between general pure states of two parties @xcite .",
    "although this question is a little more difficult , a complete solution has been developed using the mathematical framework of the theory of _",
    "majorization_. the results that have been obtained not only provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the possibility of the locc interconversion between two pure states , they are also constructive as they lead to explicit protocols that achieve the task @xcite .",
    "these conditions may be expressed most naturally in terms of the _ schmidt coefficients _ @xcite of the states involved .",
    "it is a useful fact that any bi - partite pure quantum state @xmath48 may be written in the form @xmath49 where the positive real numbers @xmath50 are the _ schmidt - coefficients _ of the state @xmath48 .. the amplitudes @xmath51 can be considered as the matrix elements of a matrix @xmath52 .",
    "this matrix hence completely represents the state ( as long as a local basis is specified ) .",
    "if we perform the local unitary transformation @xmath53 then the matrix @xmath52 gets transformed as @xmath54 .",
    "it is a well established result of matrix analysis - the _ singular value decomposition _",
    "@xcite - that any matrix @xmath52 can be _ diagonalised _ into the form @xmath55 by a suitable choice of ( @xmath56 ) , even if @xmath52 is not square .",
    "the coefficients @xmath57 are the so - called _ singular values _ of @xmath52 , and correspond to the schmidt coefficients . ]",
    "the local unitaries do not affect the entanglement properties , which is why we now write the initial state vector @xmath58 and final state vector @xmath59 in their schmidt - bases , @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the dimension of each of the quantum systems .",
    "we can take the schmidt coefficients to be given in decreasing order , i.e. , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the question of the interconvertibility between the states can then be decided from the knowledge of the real schmidt coefficients only , as any two pure states with the same schmidt coefficients may be interconverted straightforwardly by local unitary operations .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that a locc transformation converting @xmath64 to @xmath65 with unit probability exists if and only if the @xmath66 are _ majorized _ by @xmath67 , i.e. if for all @xmath68 we have that @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath61 denotes the number of nonzero schmidt - coefficients @xcite .",
    "various refinements of this result have been found that provide the largest success probabilities for the interconversion between two states by locc , together with the optimal protocol ( according to certain figures of merit ) where such a deterministic interconversion is not possible @xcite .",
    "these results allow us in principle to decide any question concerning the locc interconversion of pure states by employing techniques from linear programming @xcite .",
    "it is a direct consequence of the above structures that there are _ incomparable _ states , i.e. pairs of states such that neither can be converted into the other with certainty .",
    "these states are called incomparable as neither can be viewed as more entangled than the other .",
    "note that borrowed entanglement can make some pairs of incomparable states comparable again .",
    "indeed , there are known examples where the locc transformation of @xmath71 is not possible with probability one , but where given a suitable entangled state @xmath72 the locc transformation of @xmath73 is possible with certainty @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is now called _ entanglement catalysis _ , as the state @xmath72 is returned unchanged after the transformation , and acts much like a catalyst .",
    "the majorization condition also reveals another disadvantageous feature of the single copy setting - there can be _",
    "discontinuities_. for instance , it can be shown that the maximal probability of success for the locc transformation from @xmath74 to @xmath75 is unity , while the probability for the transformation @xmath74 to @xmath76 , i.e. even if the target states in the two examples are arbitrarily close . that the probability of success for the later transformation is zero",
    "can also be concluded easily from the fact that the schmidt - number , i.e. the number of non - vanishing schmidt - coefficients , can not be increased in an locc protocol , even probabilistically .",
    "the key problem is that we are being too restrictive in asking for _ exact _ state transformations .",
    "physically , we should be perfectly happy if we can come very close to a desired state .",
    "indeed , admitting a small but finite value of @xmath77 there will be a finite probability to achieve the transformation .",
    "this removes the above discontinuity @xcite , but the success probability will now depend on the size of the imprecision that we allow .",
    "the following subsection will serve to overcome this problem for pure states by presenting a natural definition of interconvertibility in the presence of vanishing imprecisions , a definition that will constitute our first entanglement measure .",
    "_ * state manipulation in the asymptotic limit ",
    "* _ the study of the locc transformation of pure states has so far enabled us to justify the concept of maximally entangled states and has also permitted us , in some cases , to assert that one state is more entangled than another .",
    "however , we know that exact locc transformations can only induce a partial order on the set of quantum states .",
    "the situation is even more complex for _ mixed _ states , where even the question of when it is possible to locc transform one state into another is a difficult problem with no transparent solution at the time of writing .",
    "all this means that if we want to give a definite answer as to whether one state is more entangled than another for any pair of states , it will be necessary to consider a more general setting . in this context",
    "a very natural way to compare and quantify entanglement is to study locc transformations of states in the so called _",
    "asymptotic regime_. instead of asking whether for a single pair of particles the initial state @xmath25 may be transformed to a final state @xmath26 by locc operations , we may ask whether for some large integers @xmath78 we can implement the ` wholesale ' transformation @xmath79 .",
    "the largest ratio @xmath80 for which one may achieve this would then indicate the relative entanglement content of these two states . considering the many - copy setting",
    "allows each party to perform collective operations on ( their shares of ) many copies of the states in question .",
    "such a many copy regime provides many more degrees of freedom , and in fact paves part of the way to a full classification of pure entangled states . to pave the rest of the route we will also need to discuss",
    "what kind of approximations we might admit for the output of the transformations .",
    "there are two basic approaches to this problem - we can consider either _ exact _ or _ asymptotically exact _ transformations .",
    "the distinction between these two approaches is important , as they lead to different scenarios that yield different answers . in the _ exact _ regime",
    "we allow no errors at all - we must determine whether the transformation @xmath79 can be achieved perfectly and with @xmath81 success probability for a given value of @xmath82 and @xmath61 .",
    "the supremum of all achievable rates @xmath83 is denoted by @xmath84 , and carries significance as a measure of the exact locc ` exchange rate ' between states @xmath85 .",
    "this quantity may be explored and gives some interesting results @xcite . however , from a physical point of view one may feel that the restriction to exact transformations is too stringent .",
    "after all , it should be quite acceptable to consider approximate transformations @xcite that become arbitrarily precise when going to the asymptotic limit .",
    "asymptotically vanishing imperfections , as quantified by the trace norm ( i.e. tr@xmath86 ) , will lead to vanishingly small changes in measurements of bounded observables on the output .",
    "this leads to the second approach to approximate state transformations , namely that of _ asymptotically exact _ state transformations , and this is the setting that we will consider for the remainder of this work . in this",
    "setting we consider imperfect transformations between large blocks of states , such that in the limit of large block sizes the imperfections vanish .",
    "for example , for a large number @xmath61 of copies of @xmath25 , one transforms @xmath87 to an output state @xmath88 that approximates @xmath89 very well for some large @xmath82 .",
    "if , in the limit of @xmath90 and for fixed @xmath83 , the approximation of @xmath89 by @xmath88 becomes arbitrarily good , then the rate @xmath91 is said to be _",
    "achievable_. one can use the optimal ( supremal ) achievable rate @xmath92 as a measure of the relative entanglement content of @xmath85 in the asymptotic setting .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of shannon compression in classical information theory - where the compression process loses all imperfections in the limit of infinite block sizes as long as the compression rate is below a threshold @xcite .",
    "clearly the asymptotically exact regime is less strongly constrained than the exact regime , so that @xmath93 . given that we are considering two limiting processes it is not clear whether the two quantities are actually equal and it can be rigorously demonstrated that they are different in general , see e.g. @xcite .    such an asymptotic approach will alleviate some of the problems that we encountered in the previous section .",
    "it turns out that the asymptotic setting yields a unique total order on bi - partite pure states , and as a consequence , leads to a very natural measure of entanglement that is essentially unique . to this end",
    "let us start by defining our first entanglement measure , which happens also to be one of the most important measures - the _ entanglement cost _",

    "hence we will fix the trace norm distance , i.e. @xmath101 , as our canonical choice of distance function .",
    "it may trouble the reader that in the definition of @xmath102 we have not actually taken input states that are blocks of @xmath103 copies of 2-qubit maximally entangled states , but instead have chosen as inputs single maximally entangled states between subsystems of increasing dimensions @xmath104 .",
    "however , these two approaches are equivalent because ( for integral @xmath103 ) @xmath105 is local unitarily equivalent to @xmath106 .",
    "the entanglement cost is an important measure because it quantifies a wholesale ` exchange rate ' for converting maximally entangled states to @xmath25 by locc alone .",
    "maximally entangled states are in essence the ` gold standard currency ' with which one would like to compare all quantum states .",
    "although computing @xmath102 is extremely difficult , we will later discuss its important implications for the study of channel capacities , in particular via another important and closely related entanglement measure known as the _ entanglement of formation _",
    ", @xmath107 .",
    "just as @xmath102 measures how many maximally entangled states are required to create copies of @xmath25 by locc alone , we can ask about the reverse process : at what rate may we obtain maximally entangled states ( of two qubits ) from an input supply of states of the form @xmath25 .",
    "this process is known in the literature either as _ entanglement distillation _ , or as _ entanglement concentration _",

    "so @xmath108 tells us the rate at which noisy mixed states may be converted back into the ` gold standard ' singlet state by locc . in defining @xmath108",
    "we have ignored a couple of important issues .",
    "firstly , our locc protocols are always taken to be trace preserving .",
    "however , one could conceivably allow probabilistic protocols that have varying degrees of success depending upon various measurement outcomes .",
    "fortunately , a thorough analysis by rains @xcite shows that taking into account a wide diversity of possible success measures still leads to the same notion of distillable entanglement .",
    "secondly , we have always used 2-qubit maximally entangled states as our ` gold standard ' .",
    "if we use other entangled _ pure _ states , perhaps even on higher dimensional hilbert spaces , do we arrive at significantly altered definitions ?",
    "we will very shortly see that this is not the case so there is no loss of generality in taking singlet states as our target .",
    "given these two entanglement measures it is natural to ask whether @xmath111 , i.e. whether entanglement transformations become _ reversible _ in the asymptotic limit .",
    "this is indeed the case for pure state transformations where @xmath108 and @xmath102 are identical and equal to the _ entropy of entanglement _ @xcite .",
    "the entropy of entanglement for a pure state @xmath48 is defined as @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the von - neumann entropy @xmath114 $ ] , and @xmath115 denotes the partial trace over subsystem b. this reversibility means that in the asymptotic regime we may immediately write down the optimal rate of transformation between _ any _ two pure states @xmath58 and @xmath59 . given a large number @xmath116 of copies of @xmath117 , we can first distill @xmath118 singlet states and then create from those singlets @xmath119 copies of @xmath120 . in the infinite limit these approximations become exact , and as a consequence @xmath121 is the optimal asymptotic conversion rate from @xmath122 to @xmath123 .",
    "it is the reversibility of pure state transformations that enables us to define @xmath108 and @xmath102 in terms of transformations to or from singlet states - the use of any other entangled pure state ( in any other dimensions ) simply leads to a constant factor multiplied in front of these quantities .    following these basic considerations we are now in a position to formulate a more rigorous and axiomatic approach to entanglement measures that captures the lessons",
    "that have been learned in the previous sections . in the final section",
    "we will then review several entanglement measures , presenting useful formulae and results and discuss the significance of these measures for various topics in quantum information .",
    "in the previous section we considered the quantification of entanglement from the perspective of locc transformations in the asymptotic limit . this approach is interesting because it can be solved completely for pure states .",
    "it demonstrates that locc entanglement manipulation is reversible in this setting , therefore imposing a unique order on pure entangled states via the entropy of entanglement .",
    "however , for mixed states and locc operations the situation is more complicated and reversibility is lost @xcite .",
    "the concomitant loss of a total ordering of quantum states ( in terms of rates of locc entanglement interconversions ) implies that in general an locc based classification of entanglement would be extremely complicated .",
    "however , one can try to salvage the situation by taking a more axiomatic approach .",
    "one can _ define _ real valued functions that satisfy the basic properties of entanglement that we outlined earlier , and use these functions to attempt to _ quantify _ the amount of entanglement in a given quantum state .",
    "this is essentially the process that is followed in the definition of most entanglement measures .",
    "various such quantities have been proposed over the years , such as the entanglement of distillation @xcite , the entanglement cost @xcite , the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite and the squashed entanglement @xcite .",
    "some of these measures have direct physical significance , whereas others are purely axiomatic .",
    "initially these measures were used to give a physically motivated classification of entanglement that is simple to understand , and can even be used to assess the quality of entangled states produced in experiments .",
    "however , subsequently they have also been developed into powerful mathematical tools , with great significance for open questions such as the additivity of quantum channel capacities @xcite , quantifying quantum correlations in quantum - many - body systems @xcite , and bounding quantum computing fault tolerance thresholds @xcite to name a few .    in this section",
    "we will now discuss and present a few basic axioms that any measure of entanglement should satisfy .",
    "this will allow us to define further quantities that go beyond the two important mixed state measures ( @xmath102 and @xmath124 ) that we have already introduced .",
    "so what exactly are the properties that a good entanglement measure should possess ?",
    "an entanglement measure is a mathematical quantity that should capture the essential features that we associate with entanglement , and ideally should be related to some operational procedure . depending upon your aims , this can lead to a variety of possible desirable properties .",
    "the following is a list of possible postulates for entanglement measures , some of which are not satisfied by all proposed quantities @xcite :    1 .",
    "a _ bipartite _ entanglement measure @xmath125 is a mapping from density matrices into positive real numbers : @xmath126 defined for states of arbitrary bipartite systems .",
    "a normalisation factor is also usually included such that the maximally entangled state @xmath127 of two qudits has @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath129 if the state @xmath25 is separable .",
    "@xmath130 does not increase on average under locc , i.e. , @xmath131 where the @xmath7 are the kraus operators describing some locc protocol and the probability of obtaining outcome @xmath0 is given by @xmath132 ( see fig [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "4 .   for pure state @xmath133",
    "the measure reduces to the entropy of entanglement @xmath134    we will call any function @xmath130 satisfying the first three conditions an _ entanglement monotone_. the term _ entanglement measure _ will be used for any quantity that satisfies axioms 1,2 and 4 , and also does not increase under _ deterministic _ locc transformations . in the literature these terms are often used interchangeably .",
    "note that the conditions ( 1)-(4 ) may be replaced by an equivalent set of slightly more abstract conditions which will be explained below eq .",
    "( [ continuity20 ] ) . frequently , some authors also impose additional requirements for entanglement measures :    @xmath18 _ convexity  _ one common example for an additional property required from an entanglement measure is the concept of convexity which means that we require @xmath135 requiring this mathematically very convenient property is sometimes justified as capturing the notion of the loss of information , i.e. describing the process of going from a selection of identifiable states @xmath136 that appear with rates @xmath22 to a mixture of these states of the form @xmath137 .",
    "we would like to stress , however , that some care has to be taken in this context .",
    "indeed , in the first situation , when the states are locally identifiable , the whole ensemble can be described by the quantum state @xmath138 where the @xmath139 denote some orthonormal basis for a particle belonging to one of the two parties . clearly",
    "a measurement of the marker particle @xmath140 reveals the identity of the state of parties @xmath52 and @xmath141 . losing the association between @xmath142 and state @xmath143",
    "then correctly describes the process of the forgetting , a process which is then described by tracing out the marker particle @xmath140 to obtain @xmath137 @xcite . as this is a local operation we may then require that @xmath144 , which is , of course , already required by condition 3 above .",
    "hence there is no strict need to require convexity , except for the mathematical simplicity that it might bring .",
    "a compelling example of the technical simplicity that convexity can bring is the very simple test for entanglement monotonicity of a convex function @xmath145 .",
    "indeed , a convex function @xmath145 does not increase under locc if and only if it satisfies ( i ) @xmath146 for all local unitary @xmath147 and ( ii ) @xmath148 and @xmath149 form local , orthogonal bases @xcite .",
    "@xmath18 _ additivity  _ given an entanglement measure and a state @xmath26 one may ask for the condition @xmath150 to be satisfied for all integer @xmath61 . a measure satisfying this property",
    "is said to be _",
    "additive_. unfortunately , there are some significant entanglement measures that do not satisfy this condition , and for this reason we have not included additivity as a basic postulate . however , given any measure @xmath130 that is not additive there is a straightforward way of removing this deficiency .",
    "we may define the _",
    "regularized _ , or _",
    "asymptotic _ version : @xmath151 which is a measure that then automatically satisfies additivity .",
    "a much stronger requirement could be to demand _ full additivity _ , by which we mean that for any pair of states @xmath26 and @xmath25 we have @xmath152 .",
    "this is a very strong requirement and in fact it may be too strong to be satisfied by all quantities that otherwise satisfy the four basic properties stated above . indeed , even such basic measures as the distillable entanglement may not satisfy this property @xcite .",
    "for these reason we have not included the full additivity in our set of properties",
    ". however , additivity can be a very useful mathematical property , and we will discuss it further in the context of specific measures .",
    "@xmath18 _ continuity  _ conditions ( 1 - 3 ) listed above seem quite natural - the first two conditions are little more than setting the scale , and the third condition is a generalisation of the idea that entanglement can only decrease under locc operations to incorporate probabilistic transformations .",
    "the fourth condition appears considerably stronger and perhaps arbitrary at first sight .",
    "however , it turns out that it is also quite a natural condition to impose .",
    "in fact we know that @xmath153 represents the reversible rate of conversion between pure states in the asymptotic regime which strongly suggests that it is the appropriate measure of entanglement for pure states .",
    "this is reinforced by the following nontrivial observation : it turns out that _ any _ entanglement monotone that is ( a ) additive on pure states , and ( b ) `` sufficiently continuous '' must _ equal _",
    "@xmath153 on all pure states .",
    "before we see what sufficiently continuous means we present a very rough argument for this statement .",
    "we know from the asymptotic pure state distillation protocol that from @xmath61 copies of a pure state @xmath33 we can obtain a state @xmath154 that closely approximates the state @xmath155 to within @xmath77 , where @xmath156 is the entropy of entanglement of @xmath33 .",
    "suppose therefore that we have an entanglement monotone @xmath157 that is _ additive _ on pure states . then we may write @xmath158 where the inequality is due to condition 3 for entanglement monotones",
    ". if the monotone @xmath157 is `` sufficiently continuous '' , then @xmath159 , where @xmath160 will be small",
    ". then we obtain : @xmath161 if the function @xmath157 is sufficiently continuous as the dimension increases , i.e. @xmath162 when @xmath90 , then we obtain @xmath163 .",
    "invoking the fact that the entanglement cost for pure states is also given by the entropy of entanglement gives the reverse inequality @xmath164 using similar arguments .",
    "hence sufficiently continuous monotones that are additive on pure states will naturally satisfy @xmath165 .",
    "of course these arguments are not rigorous , as we have not undertaken a detailed analysis of how @xmath166 or @xmath77 grow with @xmath61 .",
    "a rigorous analysis is presented in @xcite , where it is also shown that our assumptions may be slightly relaxed .",
    "the result of this rigorous analysis is that a function is equivalent to the entropy of entanglement on pure states _ if and only if _ it is ( a ) normalised on the singlet state , ( b ) additive on pure states , ( c ) non - increasing on _ deterministic _ pure state to pure state locc transformations , and ( d ) _ asymptotically continuous _ on pure states .",
    "the term _ asymptotically continuous _ is defined as the property @xmath167 whenever the trace norm @xmath168 on a sequence of hilbert spaces @xmath169 tends to 0 as @xmath170 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that these constraints only concern pure state properties of @xmath157 , and that they are _ necessary and sufficient_. as a consequence of the above discussion we can conclude that we could have redefined the set of axiomatic requirements ( 1)-(4 ) , without changing the set of admissible measures .",
    "we could have replaced axiom ( 4 ) with two separate requirements of ( 4a ) additivity on pure states and ( 4b ) asymptotic continuity on pure states . together with axiom ( 3 )",
    "this would automatically force any entanglement measure to coincide with the entropy of entanglement on pure states .",
    "it is furthermore interesting to note that the failure of an entanglement measure to satisfy asymptotic continuity is strongly related to the counterintuitive effect of _ lockability _ @xcite .",
    "the basic question behind lockability is : how much can entanglement of any bi- or multipartite system change when one qubit is discarded ?",
    "a measure of entanglement is said to be _",
    "lockable _ if the removal of a single qubit from a system can reduce the entanglement by an arbitrarily large amount .",
    "this qubit hence acts as a ` key ' which once removed ` locks ' the remaining entanglement .",
    "so which entanglement measures are lockable ?",
    "the remarkable answer is this effect can occur for several entanglement measures , including the entanglement cost . on the other hand another class of measures that will be described later , _ relative entropies of entanglement _ ,",
    "are not lockable @xcite .",
    "it can also be proven that any measure that is convex and is _ not _ asymptotically continuous is lockable @xcite .",
    "_ extremal entanglement measures _ in the discussions so far we have formulated several requirements on entanglement measures and suggested that various measures exist that satisfy those criteria .",
    "it is now interesting to bound the range of such entanglement measures .",
    "one may in fact show that the entanglement cost @xmath102 and the distillable entanglement @xmath108 are in some sense _ extremal _ measures @xcite , in that they are upper and lower bounds for many ` _ wholesale _ ' entanglement measures . to be precise , suppose that we have a quantity @xmath171 satisfying conditions ( 1 ) - ( 3 ) above , that is also asymptotically continuous on mixed states , and also has a _ regularisation _ @xmath172",
    "then it can be shown that @xmath173 in fact the conditions under which this statement is true are slightly more general than the ones that we have listed - for more details see @xcite .",
    "_ entanglement ordering _ the above considerations have allowed us to impose quite a great deal of structure on entangled states and the next section will make this even more clear .",
    "it should be noted however that the axioms 1 - 4 as formulated above are _ not _ sufficient to give a _ unique _ total ordering in terms of the entanglement of the set of states .",
    "one can show that any two entanglement measures satisfying axiom 4 can only impose the same ordering on the set of entangled states if they are actually exactly the same .",
    "more precisely , if for two measures @xmath174 and @xmath175 and _ any _ pair of states @xmath176 and @xmath177 we have that @xmath178 implies @xmath179 , then if both measures satisfy axiom 4 it must be the case that @xmath180 @xcite ( see @xcite for ordering results for other entanglement quantities ) .",
    "given that the entanglement cost and the distillable entanglement are strictly different on all entangled mixed states @xcite this implies that there is not a unique order , in terms of entanglement , on the set of entangled states .",
    "this suggests one of several viewpoints .",
    "we may for example have neglected to take account of the resources in entanglement manipulation with sufficient care , and doing so might lead to the notion of a unique total order and therefore a unique entanglement measure @xcite . alternatively , it may be possible that the setting of locc operations is too restrictive , and a unique total order and entanglement measure might emerge when considering more general sets of operations @xcite .",
    "both approaches have received some attention but neither has succeeded completely at the time of writing this article .    in the following",
    "we will simply accept the non - uniqueness of entanglement measures as an expression of the fact that they correspond to different operational tasks under which different forms of entanglement may have different degrees of usefulness .",
    "in this section we discuss a variety of bipartite entanglement measures and monotones that have been proposed in the literature .",
    "all the following quantities are entanglement _ monotones _ , in that they can not increase under locc . hence when they can be calculated they can be used to determine whether certain ( finite or asymptotic ) locc transformations are possible .",

    "this result suggests that as opposed to the bi - partite setting there is not such a simple and unique concept of a maximally entangled state in the multi - partite setting .",
    "one may however try and and make progress by generalizing the idea of a single entangled state from which all other states can be obtained reversibly in the asymptotic setting .",
    "instead one may consider a set of states from which all other state may be obtained asymptotically reversibly .",

    "therefore may call this tri - partite state 2-entangled .",
    "one may now try and generalize this idea to mixed states .",
    "for example we could define as the set of 2-entangled states any @xmath25 that may be written in the form @xmath445 with positive @xmath446 and @xmath447 .",
    "then , for @xmath116 parties one may then define k - entangled states as a natural generalization of the above 3-party definition . while this definition appears natural it encounters problems when we consider several identical copies of states of the form given above . in that case one can obtain a 3-entangled state by locc acting on two copies of the above 2-entangled state .",
    "as a simple example consider a three party state where alice has two qubits and bob and charlie each hold one .",

    "she can then use these epr pairs and teleportation to distribute any three party entangled state she chooses .",
    "states of three qubits displaying a similar phenomenon can also be constructed .",

    "however , there are states with genuine three party entanglement for which the residual tangle can be zero ( the w - state serves as an example @xcite )",
    ". however , the residual tangle can only be non - zero if there is genuine tripartite entanglement , and hence can be used as a indicator of three party entanglement .",
    "another way to construct multiparty entanglement measures for multi - qubit _ pure _ systems is simply to single out one qubit , compute the entanglement between that qubit and the rest of the system , and then average over all possible choices of the singled out qubit . as any _ pure _ bipartite system of dimensions",
    "@xmath476 can be written in terms of two schmidt coefficients , one can apply all the formalism of two - qubit entanglement .",
    "this approach has been taken , for example , in the paper by meyer and wallach @xcite . that the quantity proposed in @xcite is essentially only a measure of the bipartite entanglement across various splittings was shown by brennen @xcite .",
    "extensions of this approach are presented in @xcite .",
    "_ local unitary invariants : _ the residual tangle is only one of many _ local _ unitary invariants that have been developed for multiparty systems .",
    "such local invariants are very important for understanding the structure of entanglement , and have also been used to construct prototype entanglement measures .",
    "examples of local invariants that we have already mentioned are the schmidt coefficients and the geometric measure . in the multiparty case",
    "we may define the _ local _ invariants as those functions that are invariant under a _ local _ group transformation of fixed dimensions .",
    "if each particle is assumed for simplicity to have the same dimension @xmath27 , then these local groups are of the form @xmath477 where @xmath443 are taken from a particular @xmath27-dimensional group representation such as the unitary group @xmath478 or the group of invertible matrices @xmath479 .",
    "the physical significance of the local @xmath479 invariants is that if two states have different values for such an invariant then they can not even be inter - converted probabilistically using stochastic locc ( ` slocc ' ) operations . in the case of local unitary groups",
    "one typically only need consider invariants that are _ polynomial _ functions of the density matrix elements - this is because it can be shown that two states are related by a local unitary iff they have the same values on the set of polynomial invariants @xcite .",
    "for more general groups a complete set of polynomial invariants can not always be constructed , and one must also consider local invariants that are not polynomial functions of states - one example is a local @xmath480 invariant called the ` schmidt rank ' , which is the minimal number of product state - vector terms in which a given multiparty pure state may be coherently expanded . it can be shown that one can construct an entanglement monotone ( the ` schmidt measure ' ) as the convex - roof of the logarithm of this quantity @xcite .    finding non - trivial local invariants is quite challenging in general and can require some sophisticated mathematics . however , for pure states of some dimensions it is possible to use such invariants to construct a variety of entanglement quantifiers in a similar fashion to the tangle .",
    "these quantifiers are useful for identifying different types of multiparty entanglement .",
    "we refer the reader to articles @xcite and references therein for further details .",
    "quantum entanglement is a rich field of research . in recent years considerable effort",
    "has been expended on the characterization , manipulation and quantification of entanglement . the results and techniques that have been obtained in this research",
    "are now being applied not only to the quantification of entanglement in experiments but also , for example , for the assessment of the role of entanglement in quantum many body systems and lattice field theories . in this article",
    "we have surveyed many results from entanglement theory with an emphasis on the quantification of entanglement and basic theoretical tools and concepts .",
    "proofs have been omitted but useful results and formulae have been provided in the hope that they prove useful for researchers in the quantum information community and beyond . it is the hope that this article will be useful for future research in quantum information processing , entanglement theory and its implications for other areas such as statistical physics .      _ multiparty entanglement : _ the general characterisation of multiparty entanglement is a major open problem , and yet it is particularly significant for the study of quantum computation and the links between quantum information and many - body physics .",
    "particular unresolved questions include :    * _ finiteness of mregs for three qubit states  _ in an attempt to achieve a notion of reversibility in the multi - partite setting , the concept of mregs was introduced @xcite .",
    "this was a set of n - partite states for fixed local dimension from which all other such states may be obtained asymptotically reversibly .",
    "it was hoped for that such a set may contain only a finite number of states",
    ". however , there are suggestions @xcite that this may not the case . * _ distillation results for specific target states  _ in the bi - partite setting the uniqueness of maximally entangled states led to clear definitions for the distillable entanglement .",
    "as outlined above this is not so in the multi - party setting .",
    "given a specific interesting multiparty target state ( e.g. ghz states , cluster states etc . ) , or set of multiparty target states , what are the best possible distillation protocols that we can construct ?",
    "are there good bounds that can be derived using multiparty entanglement measures ?",
    "some specific examples have been considered @xcite but more general results are still missing .",
    "_ additivity questions : _ of all additivity problems , deciding whether the entanglement of formation @xmath202 is additive is perhaps the most important unresolved question .",
    "if @xmath202 is additive this would greatly simplify the evaluation of the entanglement cost .",
    "it would furthermore imply the additivity of the classical capacity of a quantum channel @xcite .",
    "related to the additivity question is the question of the monotonicity of the entanglement cost under general locc .",
    "this may be proven reasonably straightforwardly if the entanglement cost itself is fully additive . however , without this assumption no proof is known to the authors , and in fact a recent argument seems to show that full additivity of the entanglement cost is equivalent to its monotonicity @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath202 , there are many other measures for which additivity is unknown .",
    "examples include the distillable entanglement and the distillable key .    _ distillable entanglement  _ distillable entanglement is a well motivated entanglement measure of significant importance .",
    "its computation is however supremely difficult in general and even the determination of the distillability of a state is difficult . indeed ,",
    "good techniques or algorithms for deciding whether a bipartite state is distillable or not , and for bounding the distillable entanglement , are still largely missing .",
    "* _ are there npt bound entangled states ?  _ in the bi - partite setting there are currently three known distinct classes of states in terms of their entanglement properties under locc .",
    "these are the separable states , the non - separable states with positive partial transpose ( which are also non - distillable ) , and finally the distillable states .",
    "some evidence exists that there is another class of states that do not possess a positive partial transpose but are nevertheless non - distillable @xcite . *",
    "_ bounds on the distillable entanglement . _",
    "any entanglement measure provides an upper bound on the distillable entanglement .",
    "various bounds have been provided such as the squashed entanglement @xcite , the rains bound @xcite and asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the last two of these coincide for werner states @xcite and it is an open question whether they always coincide , and whether they are larger or smaller than the squashed entanglement .    _ entanglement measures  _ the present article has presented a host of entanglement measures .",
    "many of their properties are known but crucial issues remain to be resolved . amongst these are the following .    * _ operational interpretation of the relative entropy of entanglement  _ while the entanglement cost and the distillable entanglement possess evident operational interpretations no such clear interpretation is known for the relative entropy of entanglement .",
    "a possible interpretation in terms of the distillation of local information has been conjectured and partially proven in @xcite . *",
    "_ calculation of various entanglement measures  _ there are very few measures of entanglement that can be computed exactly and possess or are expected to possess an operational interpretation . a notable exception is the entanglement of formation for which a formula exists for the two qubit case @xcite . is it possible to compute , or at least derive better bounds , for the other variational entanglement measures ?",
    "one interesting possibility is the 2-qubit case - in analogy to @xmath202 , is there a closed form for the relative entropy of entanglement or the squashed entanglement ? * _ squashed entanglement  _ as an additive , convex , and asymptotically continuous entanglement monotone the squashed entanglement is known to possess almost all potentially desirable properties as an entanglement measure .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of open interesting questions - in particular : ( 1 ) is the squashed entanglement strictly non - zero on inseparable states , and ( 2 ) can the squashed entanglement be formulated as a finite dimensional optimisation problem ( with eve s system of bounded dimension ) ? * _ asymptotic continuity and lockability questions ",
    "_ it is unknown whether measures such as the distillable key , the distillable entanglement , and the entanglement cost are asymptotically continuous , and it is unknown whether the distillable entanglement or distillable key are lockable @xcite .",
    "this is important to know as lockability quantifies ` continuity under tensor products ' , and so is a physically important property - if a system is susceptible to loss of particles , then any characteristic quantified by a lockable measure will tend to be very fragile in the presence of such noise .    _",
    "entanglement manipulation  _ entanglement can be manipulated under various sets of operations , including locc and ppt operations .",
    "while some understanding of what is possible and impossible has been obtained , a complete understanding has not been reached yet .",
    "* _ characterization of entanglement catalysis  _ for a single copy of bi - partite pure state entanglement the locc transformations are fully characterized by the theory of majorization @xcite .",
    "it was discovered that there are transformations @xmath481 such that its success probability under locc is @xmath482 but for which an entangled state @xmath72 exists such that @xmath483 can be achieved with certainty under locc @xcite .",
    "a complete characterization for states admitting entanglement catalysis is currently not known . * _ other classes of non - global operation .",
    "reversibility under ppt operations ",
    "_ it is well established that even in the asymptotic limit locc entanglement transformations of mixed states are irreversible .",
    "however in @xcite it was shown that that the antisymmetric werner state may be reversibly interconverted into singlet states under ppt operations @xcite .",
    "it is an open question whether this result may be extended to all werner states or even to all possible states .",
    "in addition to questions concerning ppt operations , are there other classed of non - global operation that can be useful ? if reversibility under ppt operations does not hold , do any other classes of non - global operations exhibit reversibility ?    more open problems in quantum information science can be found in the braunschweig webpage of open problems @xcite . we hope that this list will stimulate some of the readers of this article into attacking some of these open problems and perhaps report solutions , even partial ones .    _",

    "the no - go theorem for gaussian entanglement distillation is actually quite subtle , as even defining gaussian distillation is non - trivial .",
    "consider for example the version of the no - go theorem proven in @xcite - there entanglement distillation is defined as a process which allows you to reach a two - mode squeezed state with arbirarily high squeezing .",
    "although @xcite show that this is not possible , from an operational perspective one can use gaussian operations to improve the quality of the entanglement present . for instance , consider a bi - partite four - mode state @xmath25 which consists of a two - mode highly entangled state tensored with a product pure state . given two copies of @xmath25 , alice and bob",
    "can merely throw away the product components and are left with a single four - mode state that possesses greater utility for quantum information processing .",
    "hence according to an operational definition of entanglement distillation ( say improvement of teleportation fidelity ) , it is possible to distill gaussian entanglement using gaussian operations from gaussian states of 2 @xmath484 2 modes .",
    "this apparent contradiction arises because there are different ways in which one can quantify the increase of entanglement of quantum states - in principle this subtle distinction may also be an issue in the finite dimensional regime .",
