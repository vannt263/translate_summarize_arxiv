    "coloring of graphs embedded in surfaces , in the plane in particular , attracts a lot of attention of researchers in graph theory .",
    "the famous four color theorem  @xcite asserts that every graph that can be drawn in the plane with no crossings is @xmath1-colorable .",
    "it is natural to ask what number of colors is needed to color graphs that can be embedded in the plane with a restricted number of crossings .",
    "if every edge is crossed by at most one edge ( such graphs are called @xmath2-embeddable and we restrict our attention solely to such graphs throughout this paper ) , ringel  @xcite conjectured that six colors suffice .",
    "this conjecture was answered in affirmative by borodin  @xcite .",
    "albertson  @xcite considered graphs with even more restricted structure of crossings .",
    "two distinct crossings are independent if the end - vertices of the crossed pair of edges are mutually different . in particular , if all crossings are independent , then each edge is crossed by at most one other edge .",
    "albertson showed that every graph drawn in the plane with at most 3 crossings is @xmath0-colorable ( note that the complete graph of order five can be drawn in the plane with a single crossing ) and conjectured  @xcite that every graph that can be drawn in the plane with all its crossings independent is @xmath0-colorable . in this paper , we prove his conjecture .    the coloring problem that we study is closely related to the notion of cyclic coloring .",
    "a coloring of vertices of an embedded graph is _ cyclic _ if any two vertices incident with the same face receive distinct colors .",
    "let us show how the original problem can be expressed using this notion .",
    "let @xmath3 be a plane graph with all its crossings independent .",
    "we can assume ( by adding edges if necessary ) that all faces of @xmath3 that do not contain a crossing have size three and those that contain a crossing have size four .",
    "remove now all edges that are crossed by another edge .",
    "clearly , a cyclic coloring of the obtained graph @xmath4 is a proper coloring of the original graph @xmath3 and vice versa .",
    "the assumption that all crossings of @xmath3 are independent translates to the fact that all faces of @xmath4 with size four are vertex disjoint .",
    "hence , our main result can be stated as follows :    [ thm - main ] let @xmath3 be a plane graph with faces of size three and four only . if all the faces of size four are vertex - disjoint , then @xmath3 is cyclically @xmath0-colorable .",
    "before we proceed with proving theorem  [ thm - main ] , let us survey known results on cyclic colorings of plane graphs . since the maximum face size is a lower bound on the number of colors needed in a cyclic coloring , it is natural to study the number of colors needed to cyclically color a plane graph as a function of its maximum face size @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath6 , then the graph is a triangulation and the optimal number of colors is four by the four color theorem . if @xmath7 , then the optimal number of colors six by results of borodin  @xcite ; the optimality is witnessed by the prism over @xmath8 . for larger values of @xmath5 , the cyclic coloring conjecture of ore and plummer",
    "@xcite asserts that the optimal number of colors is equal to @xmath9 ( the optimality is witnessed by a drawing of @xmath10 with subdivided edges ) .",
    "after a series of papers  @xcite on this problem , the best general bound of @xmath11 has been obtained by sanders and zhao  @xcite .",
    "amini , esperet and van den heuvel  @xcite cleverly used a result by havet , van den heuvel , mcdiarmid and reed  @xcite on coloring squares of planar graphs and showed that the cyclic coloring conjecture is asymptotically true in the following sense : for every @xmath12 , there exists @xmath13 such that every plane graph of maximum face size @xmath14 admits a cyclic coloring with at most @xmath15 colors .",
    "there are two other conjectures related to the cyclic coloring conjecture of ore and plummer .",
    "a conjecture of plummer and toft  @xcite asserts that every @xmath16-connected plane graph is cyclically @xmath17-colorable .",
    "this conjecture is known to be true for @xmath18 and @xmath19 , see  @xcite .",
    "the restriction of the problems to plane graphs with a bounded maximum face size is removed in the facial coloring conjecture  @xcite that asserts that vertices of every plane graph can be colored with at most @xmath20 colors in such a way that every two vertices joined by a facial walk of length at most @xmath21 receive distinct colors .",
    "this conjecture would imply the cyclic coloring conjecture for odd values of @xmath5 .",
    "partial results towards proving this conjecture can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm - main ] is divided into several steps .",
    "we first identify configurations that can not appear in a counterexample with the smallest number of vertices .",
    "later , using a discharging argument , we show that a plane graph avoiding all these configurations can not exist .",
    "in particular , vertices and faces of a counterexample are assigned charge whose total sum is negative and which is redistributed preserving its total sum .",
    "lemmas  [ lm - f55][lm - v6 ] claim that the final amount of charge of every vertex and every face is non - negative which excludes the existence of a counterexample and yields a proof of theorem  [ thm - main ] .",

    "if @xmath3 is a plane graph with faces of size three only , then four color theorem implies that @xmath3 is cyclically @xmath1-colorable .",
    "our theorem asserts that every plane graph with faces of size three and four such that all faces of size four are vertex - disjoint is cyclically @xmath0-colorable .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the following might be true :      let us remark that it is quite easy to see that such graphs @xmath3 are @xmath158-colorable . indeed , adding a clique to every face of size four or more results in a graph with average degree less than @xmath159 . after removing a vertex from @xmath3 that has degree less than @xmath159 in the modified graph and adding edges to @xmath3 in such a way that big faces are still vertex - disjoint and all vertices lying on a common face in @xmath3 lie on a common face in the new graph , induction can be applied to the new graph which yields the proof of the claimed bound .",
