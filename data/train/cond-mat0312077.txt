    "it is known that the general trends of the behavior of a dynamical system can be captured , in some cases of interest , by the so  called amplitude equations @xcite , describing the slow dynamics of the envelope of the trajectories .",
    "one of the most interesting features of amplitude equations is their universality : many systems can share the same amplitude equation depending only on general symmetry considerations .",
    "another advantage of using the amplitude equations is that they allow numerical integration with a bigger integration step .",
    "a very successful technique , amongst others , for the derivation of amplitude equations is that of the multiple scales method .",
    "this technique has been extensively applied , for instance , to both unforced and periodically forced nonlinear oscillators @xcite . however , for more general , e.g. non periodic , forcing terms there is no systematic derivation of the amplitude equation . in this paper",
    "we develop a possible extension of the multiple scales method to obtain amplitude equations for dynamical systems forced with general functions . as an application",
    ", we consider oscillators which are randomly forced either by additive noise @xcite or by multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "the derivation of amplitude equations for randomly forced dynamical systems has been previously considered in the literature . in some works ,",
    "dynamical systems are treated in a probabilistic way and noise effects on bifurcations are studied @xcite .",
    "a different approach has been used in references @xcite where the authors derive a stochastic landau form as the amplitude equation for the stochastic swift ",
    "hohenberg model and use it to describe the dynamics of the bifurcating solutions .",
    "a simplifying feature of this case is that the swift  hohenberg equation has only first order derivatives in time .",
    "second order equations have been studied in @xcite at the level of probability distribution functions .",
    "our method , being an straightforward extension of the multiple scales method , can be easily applied to dynamical systems including second order time derivatives .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec1 ] , the general theory is presented using the van der pol  duffing oscillator with an arbitrary forcing term as an example . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "the same oscillator is considered under the influence of an additive noise forcing term . in section [ sec3 ] , we present the results for the multiplicative noise case .",
    "finally , the main conclusions of this paper are reviewed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "although we believe our method to be quite general , for the sake of concreteness , in this section we study an oscillatory system , namely a van der pol  duffing oscillator , with a general additive forcing term , as defined by the following equation for the variable @xmath0 : @xmath1 ~+ \\epsilon ~f(t ) , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] being @xmath2 any time dependent function and @xmath3 is considered as a small parameter .",

    "the evolution can be written as @xmath11 , being @xmath12 the slowly varying complex amplitude ( @xmath13 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath14 ) .",
    "we extend the method of multiple scales in order to be able to consider equation ( [ eq1 ] ) for a general function @xmath2 .",
    "let us briefly review the method of multiple scales@xcite . in this method ,",
    "one looks for a series expansion of the time dependent variable , @xmath0 , of the form : @xmath15 the main point is to consider different time scales : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , ... , with @xmath19 as independent variables and hence any function of time becomes a function of the @xmath20 s : @xmath21 the time derivative is transformed according to @xmath22 where @xmath23 . by substituting this expansion into ( [ eq1 ] ) and equating coefficients up to order @xmath24 , one obtains : @xmath25    the solution of ( [ eq3 ] ) is @xmath26 where it has been assumed that the amplitude @xmath27 of the sinusoidal solution depends only on the slow time variable @xmath17 instead of all the sequence @xmath28 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath29 . replacing this solution in ( [ eq4 ] ) , we get : @xmath30 e^{i t_0 } \\label{eq6}\\nonumber\\\\\\nonumber   & & + [ -i k_1 \\bar{a } ( 1 - |a|^2 ) + 2 i \\bar{a}'-3 k_2   a |a|^2 ] e^{-i t_0 }   \\\\\\nonumber   & &   - i a^3 e^{3 i t_0 } +",

    "the amplitude equation is obtained by avoiding resonant terms with the frequency of the l.h.s of the equation , @xmath33 with the scalar product for the @xmath16 variable defined as @xmath34 and the result @xmath35 . by using ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] )",

    "the resulting _ amplitude equation _ is : @xmath42 it is clear that the proper time scale for the variation of the amplitude @xmath14 is given by @xmath17 .",
    "for any other function @xmath2 the splitting of the time @xmath43 in terms of slow , @xmath16 , and fast , @xmath17 , variables might not be so straightforward .",
    "in general we will have to compute expressions of the form : @xmath44 our proposal is to make the following decomposition : @xmath45 which has the property that the contribution to the scalar product ( [ eq10 ] ) is different from zero : @xmath46 this simple substitution rule has to be applied with the necessary values of @xmath47 as demanded in each case . notice that this decomposition gives always a non vanishing contribution to the scalar product",
    "this is particularly interesting in the case of nearly constant functions @xmath2 for which the spectrum has a peak at @xmath48 , far from the main peaks at @xmath49 . in the white noise case , our proposal is able to extract a suitable contribution from the flat spectrum .",
