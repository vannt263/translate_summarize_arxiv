    "solitons play an important role in many areas of physics . as classical solutions of non - linear field theories",
    ", they are localized structures with finite energy , which are globally regular . in general",
    ", one can distinguish between topological and non - topological solitons .",
    "while topological solitons @xcite possess a conserved quantity , the topological charge , that stems ( in most cases ) from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the theory , non - topological solitons @xcite have a conserved noether charge that results from a symmetry of the lagrangian .",
    "the standard example of non - topological solitons are @xmath0-balls @xcite , which are solutions of theories with self - interacting complex scalar fields .",
    "these objects are stationary with an explicitly time - dependent phase . the conserved noether charge @xmath0 is then related to the global phase invariance of the theory and is directly proportional to the frequency .",
    "@xmath0 can e.g. be interpreted as particle number @xcite .",
    "while in standard scalar field theories , it was shown that a non - normalizable @xmath1-potential is necessary @xcite , supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) also possess @xmath0-ball solutions @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "several scalar fields interact via complicated potentials .",
    "it was shown that cubic interaction terms that result from yukawa couplings in the superpotential and supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking terms lead to the existence of @xmath0-balls with non - vanishing baryon or lepton number or electric charge .",
    "these supersymmetric @xmath0-balls have been considered as possible candidates for baryonic dark matter @xcite and their astrophysical implications have been discussed @xcite . in @xcite , these objects have been constructed numerically using the exact form of a scalar potential that results from gauge - mediated susy breaking . however , this potential is non - differentiable at the susy breaking scale . in @xcite a differentiable approximation of this potential",
    "was suggested and the properties of the corresponding @xmath0-balls have been investigated .",
    "@xmath0-ball solutions in @xmath2 dimensions have been studied in detail in @xcite using a @xmath1-potential .",
    "it was realized that next to non - spinning @xmath0-balls , which are spherically symmetric , spinning solutions exist .",
    "these are axially symmetric with energy density of toroidal shape and angular momentum @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is the noether charge of the solution and @xmath4 corresponds to the winding around the @xmath5-axis . approximated solutions of the non - linear partial differential equations were constructed in @xcite by means of a truncated series in the spherical harmonics to describe the angular part of the solutions .",
    "the full partial differential equation was solved numerically in @xcite .",
    "it was also realized in @xcite that in each @xmath6-sector , parity - even ( @xmath7 ) and parity - odd ( @xmath8 ) solutions exist .",
    "parity - even and parity - odd refers to the fact that the solution is symmetric and anti - symmetric , respectively with respect to a reflection through the @xmath9-@xmath10-plane , i.e. under @xmath11 .",
    "complex scalar field models coupled to gravity possess so - called `` boson star '' solutions @xcite . in @xcite boson stars have been considered that have flat space - time limits in the form of @xmath0-balls .",
    "these boson stars are hence self - gravitating @xmath0-balls .",
    "the gravity  gauge theory duality @xcite has attracted a lot of attention in the past years .",
    "the most famous example is the ads / cft correspondence @xcite which states that a gravity theory in a @xmath12-dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) space  time is equivalent to a conformal field theory ( cft ) on the @xmath13-dimensional boundary of ads . recently",
    ", this theory has been used to describe so - called holographic conductor / superconductor phase transitions with the help of black holes in higher dimensional space ",
    "time @xcite .",
    "close to the horizon of the black hole the effective mass of the scalar field can become negative with masses below the breitenlohner ",
    "freedman bound @xcite such that the scalar field becomes unstable and possesses a non  vanishing value on and close to the horizon of the black hole .",
    "interestingly , the model used to describe conductor / superconductor phase transitions by using black holes in higher - dimensional ads can be modified to describe insulator / superconductor phase transitions by considering soliton solutions in higher - dimensional ads .",
    "this was done in @xcite and @xcite in ( 4 + 1)-dimensional ads in the probe limit and taking backreaction into account , respectively as well as in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional ads in @xcite .",
    "the ads soliton is related to the black hole by a double wick rotation .",
    "moreover , one of the coordinates is compactified to a circle .",
    "the ads soliton has been used before in the context of the description of a confining vacuum in the dual gauge theory @xcite since it possesses a mass gap .",
    "while for spherically symmetric black holes in ads there is the hawking - page phase transition from the ads black hole to global ads space - time when lowering the temperature @xcite , this is different for ads black holes with ricci - flat horizons used in the description of holographic superconductors . in that case",
    ", there is a phase transition between the ads black hole and the ads soliton @xcite which was interpreted as a confining / deconfining phase transition in the dual gauge theory . now taking the viewpoint of condensed matter this phase transition describes a 1st order insulator / conductor phase transition . to complete the picture it was realized in @xcite that one can add a chemical potential to the ads soliton .",
    "increasing the chemical potential @xmath14 the ads soliton becomes unstable to the formation of scalar hair above some critical value @xmath15 .",
    "this was interpreted as a 2nd order insulator / superconductor phase transition that is possible even at zero temperature .",
    "the study done in the probe limit in @xcite was extended to take backreaction into account @xcite .",
    "phase diagrams were constructed and it was shown that there is a new type of phase transition from a superconductor to an insulator for sufficiently strong backreaction .",
    "qualitatively similar results exist when describing insulator / superfluid phase transitions with non - vanishing superfluid velocity @xcite .",
    "charged solitons in global ads have also recently been studied in 4 dimensions @xcite as well as in 5 dimensions @xcite .",
    "the limit of vanishing gauge coupling has also been studied in @xcite . in that case",
    ", the soliton solutions correspond to planar boson stars in ads space - time .",
    "since the scalar field is uncharged the interpretation in terms of insulators / superconductors is difficult in this case .",
    "however , since the ads / cft correspondence connects strongly coupled cfts to weakly coupled gravity theories the prototype example of a strongly coupled field theory comes to mind - quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "as such the planar boson stars in ads have been interpreted as bose - einstein condensates of glueballs .",
    "glueballs are color - neutral bound states of gluons predicted by qcd and the scalar glueball ( which is also the lightest possible glueball ) is predicted to have a mass of 1 - 2 gev ( see e.g. @xcite for an overview on experimental results ) .",
    "since these glueballs appear due to non - linear interactions and as such can not be described by a perturbative approach it is very difficult to make predictions within the framework of quantum field theory .",
    "however , holographic methods have been applied to make predictions about glueball spectra ( see e.g. @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "the spherically symmetric counterparts of boson stars in ads space - time have been studied before using a massive scalar field without self - interaction @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will extend the results of @xcite by including a self - interaction potential of exponential form motivated from supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the study in @xcite our solutions exist also in the limit of vanishing gravitational coupling and correspond to @xmath0-balls in an ads background .",
    "moreover , in @xcite the frequency appearing in the periodic time - dependence of the solutions has been scaled to unity . in this paper , we will explicitly keep this parameter .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we give the model , the ansatz and the equations of motion . in section 3 and 4 ,",
    "respectively , we discuss @xmath0-balls in an ads background and boson stars in ads space - time . in section 5 ,",
    "we give the holographic interpretation of our solutions , while we conclude in section 6 .",
    "the existence of @xmath0-balls in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model has been suggested some time ago . in @xcite these @xmath0-balls",
    "have been constructed using the following potential @xmath16 where @xmath17 corresponds to the scale below which supersymmetry is broken and is roughly @xmath18 tev , while @xmath6 denotes the scalar boson mass .",
    "this potential is not differentiable at @xmath19 .",
    "this is why the following approximation of the above potential has been suggested @xcite @xmath20 in the following we will study non - spinning @xmath0-balls and boson stars in a model containing this potential in asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) space - time .",

    "the coupled system of ordinary differential equations is then given by the einstein equations @xmath47 with @xmath48 given by ( [ em ] ) and the klein - gordon equation @xmath49 in order to be able to use dimensionless quantities we introduce the following rescalings @xmath50 and find that the equations depend only on the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the planck mass .",

    "we hence require @xmath63 while we choose @xmath64 ( any other choice would just result in a rescaling of the time coordinate ) .",
    "moreover , while the scalar field function falls of exponentially for @xmath65 with @xmath66 it falls of power - law for @xmath67 with @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a constant that has to be determined numerically and which can be interpreted via ads / cft as the value of the condensate of glueballs in the dual theory living on the boundary of global ads .",

    "our numerical results suggest that the larger the absolute value of @xmath25 the smaller in the value of @xmath119 at which the condensate reaches its maximum . however , the corresponding values of the mass and charge at which the maximal condensate appears are significantly larger than the values of the mass and charge necessary to form a condensate in the first place .    we have also studied the value of the condensate for the radially excited @xmath0-ball solutions mentioned above .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[holo_ex1 ] , where we present @xmath145 in dependence on @xmath119 ( a ) , in dependence on the charge @xmath0 ( b ) and in dependence on the mass @xmath72 ( c ) , respectively , in an ads background with @xmath146 and for the fundamental solution without nodes ( @xmath137 ) and for the radially excited solutions with @xmath139 nodes .",
    "it is apparent that the value of the condensate increases with increasing node number for fixed @xmath119 , @xmath72 or @xmath0 .",
    "hence , larger condensates can built up in the presence of radially excited @xmath0-ball solutions . however , since we expect these radially excited solutions to be unstable to decay to the fundamental solution , these condensates are very likely unstable .",
    "it would have to be computed explicitely how long - lived these excited solutions are - and hence of how much physical relevance these condensates are .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath71 .",
    "our results for fixed @xmath146 and different values of the backreaction are shown in fig.[holo2 ] .",
    "plotting the condensate as function of @xmath119 ( see fig.[holo2_1 ] ) we find that a value of @xmath147 exists at which the condensate has a maximal value .",
    "this was also observed for planar boson stars in @xcite .",
    "we find that the larger the backreaction , i.e. the larger @xmath53 the smaller is @xmath148 .",
    "moreover , at a critical value of @xmath149 , the condensate tends to zero again .",
    "hence , glueball condensates are only possible in a finite range of the parameter @xmath119 .",
    "the interval of @xmath119 on which glueball condensates exist decreases when increasing the backreaction .",
    "when plotting the condensate as function of the charge @xmath0 and the mass @xmath72 ( see fig.[holo2_2 ] and fig.[holo2_3 ] , respectively ) we find that glueball condensates exist only up to a maximal finite mass of the charge and mass .",
    "moreover , the value of the condensate increases for fixed @xmath0 or @xmath72 when increasing the backreaction . this is a standard observation in applications of the ads / cft correspondence applied to strongly coupled qfts ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "interestingly , we observe that in a small interval close to the maximal charge @xmath0 ( respectively maximal mass @xmath72 ) two different values of the condensate are possible for a fixed @xmath72 and @xmath0 .",
    "one of the branches corresponds to a stable boson star , while the other would probably be unstable . for the unstable boson star ,",
    "the condensate can be larger .",
    "however , it would likely be much shorter lived than that building up for a stable boson star . in order to decide",
    "how short - lived this is , one would probably have to simulate the dynamical decay of the unstable boson star to the stable one .",
    "this is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "we have also studied the condensate building up on radially excited boson stars in ads space - time .",
    "our results for @xmath150 and @xmath105 are given in fig.[holo2ex ] .",
    "we show the condensate for the fundamental solution ( @xmath137 ) as well as for the two radially excited solutions with @xmath139 .",
    "it is apparent that the values of the condensate can be much higher in the space - time of radially excited boson stars .",
    "this is similar to what we have observed for the @xmath0-balls in an ads background ( see above ) .",
    "we find that the difference of the condensate on the first and second branch of solutions increases with increasing node number .",
    "while the difference between the two branches for @xmath137 is quite small , it is already quite big for @xmath151 .",
    "again , we expect these solutions to be unstable and hence the condensates to decay .",
    "in this paper , we have studied ads @xmath0-balls and boson stars that arise in a complex scalar field model with exponential potential .",
    "this potential appears in gauge - mediated susy breaking in the mssm .",
    "we find that the qualitative features in the case of an asymptotically flat space - time are similar to those observed for other potentials .",
    "when choosing a non - vanishing cosmological constant the qualitative features change .",
    "a study on boson stars in ads already exists for a massive scalar field without self - interaction @xcite , however , in this latter paper the frequency has been scaled to one . in the present paper , we have kept the frequency as a parameter and have studied the dependence of the mass and charge of the solutions on this parameter .",
    "we observe that @xmath0-balls in an ads background exist for arbitrary values of the charge and mass and that only one branch of solutions exists .",
    "moreover , we find that radially excited solutions exist both for a minkowski as well as for an ads background . when including backreaction of the space - time , we find that boson stars exist only up to a maximal value of the mass and charge and that at the minimal value of the frequency a spiraling behaviour appears .",
    "plotting the value of the scalar field on the ads boundary and interpreting our solutions as holographic duals of bose - einstein condensates of scalar glueballs , we find that a maximal value of the condensate exists in the probe limit as well as in the backreacted case .",
    "moreover , for fixed values of the charge and mass of the solutions , we find that more than one value of the condensate is possible .",
    "however , the condensate with the larger value is ( likely ) associated to an unstable solution and would hence decay .    in this paper",
    ", we have only studied non - spinning @xmath0-balls and boson stars .",
    "it would be interesting to extend our results to the case of rotation .",
    "these solutions have already been studied for a @xmath100-potential in asymptotically flat space - time @xcite and we would expect that they also exist in asymptotically ads and with an exponential potential .",
    "the question is then whether the boundary theory would also possess rotation and if one could hence describe rotating bose - einstein condensates of glueballs with our model .",
    "this is currently under investigation .",
