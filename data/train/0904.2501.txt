    "hematopoiesis is the process by which erythrocytes ( red blood cells ) , leukocytes ( white blood cells ) and thrombocytes ( platelets ) are produced and regulated .",
    "these cells perform a variety of vital functions such as transporting oxygen , repairing lesions , and fighting infections .",
    "therefore , the body must carefully regulate their production .",
    "for example , there are @xmath2 erythrocytes for each kilogram of body weight , so almost @xmath3 of the body mass is red blood cells .",
    "the turnover rate is about @xmath4 erythrocytes / kg of body weight each day , which must be carefully regulated by several @xmath5 sensitive receptors and a collection of growth factors and hormones .",
    "although understanding of blood production process evolves constantly , the main outlines are clear",
    ".    blood cells , that can be observed in blood vessels , are originated from a pool of hematopoietic pluripotent stem cells , located in the bone marrow of most of human bones .",
    "hematopoietic pluripotent stem cells , which are undifferentiated cells with a high self - renewal and differentiation capacity , give rise to committed stem cells , which form bands of cells called colony forming units ( cfu ) .",
    "these committed stem cells are specialized in the sense that they can only produce one of the three blood cell types : red blood cells , white cells or platelets .",
    "colony forming units differentiate in precursor cells , which are not stem cells anymore , because they have lost their self - renewal capacity .",
    "these cells eventually give birth to mature blood cells which enter the bloodstream .",
    "one can see that the hematopoiesis process is formed by a succession of complex differentiations from hematopoietic pluripotent stem cells to precursors .",
    "these different differentiations , occurring in the bone marrow , are mainly mediated by growth factors .",
    "they are proteins acting , in some way , like hormones playing an activator / inhibitor role .",
    "each type of blood cell is the result of specific growth factors acting at a specific moment during the hematopoiesis process .    the red blood cells production , for example , called erythropoiesis , is mainly mediated by erythropoietin ( epo ) , a growth factor produced at 90% by the kidneys .",
    "erythropoietin is released in the bloodstream due to tissue hypoxia .",
    "it stimulates the erythropoiesis in the bone marrow , causing an increase in circulating red blood cells , and consequently an increase in the tissue p@xmath5 levels .",
    "then the release of erythropoietin decreases and a regulation of the process is observed : there is a feedback control from the blood to the bone marrow . in extreme situations , like bleeding or moving to high altitudes , where needs in oxygen are important , erythropoiesis is accelerated .",
    "white blood cells are produced during leukopoiesis and the main growth factors acting on their regulation are granulocyte - csf ( colony stimulating factor ) , macrophage - csf , granulocyte - macrophage - csf , and different interleukins ( il-1 , il-2 , il-6 , il-8 , etc . ) .",
    "platelets are mainly regulated by thrombopoietin ( tpo ) , which acts similarly to erythropoietin .",
    "the hematopoiesis process sometimes exhibits abnormalities in blood cells production , causing the so - called dynamical hematological diseases .",
    "most of these diseases seem to be due to a destabilization of the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell compartment caused by the action of one or more growth factors . for erythropoiesis , abnormalities in the feedback between erythropoietin and the bone marrow production",
    "are suspected to cause periodic hematological disorders , such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia .",
    "cyclic neutropenia , one of the most intensively studied periodic hematological diseases characterized by a fall of neutrophils ( white blood cells ) counts every three weeks , is now known to be due to a destabilization of the apoptotic ( mortality ) rate during the proliferating phase of the cell cycle .",
    "mathematical models of hematopoiesis have been intensively studied since the end of the 1970s .",
    "to our knowledge , mackey @xcite proposed the first model of hematopoiesis in 1978 and 1979 .",
    "this model takes the form of a delay differential equation . since then it has been modified and studied by many authors , including mackey .",
    "the works of mackey and rudnicki @xcite and mackey and rey @xcite deal with age - maturity structured models of hematopoiesis based on the model of mackey @xcite .",
    "recently , pujo - menjouet _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have studied the model of mackey @xcite and obtained the existence of periodic solutions , with long periods comparing to the cell cycle duration , describing phenomena observed during some periodic hematological diseases .",
    "however , the influence of growth factors has never been explicitly incorporated in these models .    in 1995 and 1998 ,",
    "belair _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and mahaffy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered a mathematical model for erythropoiesis .",
    "the model is a system of age and maturity structured equations , which can be reduced to a system of delay differential equations .",
    "they showed that their model fitted well with experimental observations in normal erythropoiesis but they stressed some difficulties to reproduce pathological behavior observed for periodic hematological diseases .    in this paper we consider a system of differential equations modelling the evolution of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow , of mature blood cells in the bloodstream and of the concentration of some growth factors acting on the stem cell population .",
    "a delay naturally appears in the model , describing the cell cycle duration .",
    "this approach is based on the early work of mackey @xcite and the recent work of belait _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and mahaffy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite dealing with erythropoiesis .",
    "our aim is to show that oscillations in such models are mainly due to the destabilization of the feedback loop between blood cells and growth factors , causing periodic hematological diseases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the biological background leading to the mathematical model . after showing the existence of a positive equilibrium , we analyze its local asymptotic stability .",
    "this analysis is performed through the study of a characteristic equation which takes the form of a third degree exponential polynomial with delay - dependent coefficients .",
    "using the approach of beretta and kuang @xcite , we show that the positive steady - state can be destabilized through a hopf bifurcation and stability switches can occur .",
    "we illustrate our results with numerical simulations and show that long period oscillations can be observed in this model , as it can be observed in patients with some periodic hematological diseases .",
    "in the bone marrow , hematopoietic stem cells are divided in two groups : proliferating and non - proliferating , or quiescent , cells .",
    "the existence of a quiescent phase , also called @xmath6 phase , in the cell cycle has been proved , for example , by burns and tannock @xcite .",
    "quiescent cells represent the major part of hematopoietic stem cells , that is about 90% of the hematopoietic stem cell population .",
    "proliferating cells are cells actually in cycle : they are committed to divide during mitosis after , in particularly , having synthesized dna . immediately after division , proliferating cells enter the @xmath6 phase where they can stay their entire life .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 and @xmath8 the quiescent and proliferating cell populations at time @xmath9 respectively . in the proliferating phase , apoptosis , which is a programmed cell death ,",
    "controls the cell population and eliminates deficient cells .",
    "we assume that the apoptosis rate , denoted by @xmath10 , is constant and nonnegative . in the @xmath6 phase ,",
    "cells can disappear , by natural death , with a rate @xmath11 .",
    "they also differentiate in mature blood cells with a rate @xmath12 , where the function @xmath13 is assumed to be nonnegative with @xmath14 , because no cell can become mature when there is no hematopoietic stem cell , and continuously differentiable .",
    "moreover , we assume that the function @xmath15 is nondecreasing for @xmath16 , which is equivalent to @xmath17 it follows , in particularly , that @xmath13 is nondecreasing and @xmath18 .",
    "quiescent cells can also be introduced in the proliferating phase during their life in order to ensure the population renewal , at a nonconstant rate @xmath19 .",
    "it is generally accepted that @xmath19 depends on the total population of non - proliferating cells @xcite .",
    "however , the production of mature blood cells is also mediated by growth factors through the stem cell population : growth factors induce differentiation and maturation of hematopoietic cells via the stem cell compartment .",
    "thus , the dependence of @xmath19 on growth factors must be represented .",
    "we assume that @xmath19 is continuously differentiable .",
    "moreover , in the particular case of erythropoiesis , @xmath19 is an increasing function of the erythropoietin concentration , because a release of erythropoietin increases the production of red blood cells .",
    "hence , we assume that @xmath19 is an increasing function of the growth factor concentration , with @xmath20 , and a nonincreasing function of the @xmath6 phase population @xcite .",
    "thus , the equations modelling the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow are @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the growth factor concentration at time @xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 denotes the average time needed by a proliferating cell to divide , that is , @xmath25 is an average cell cycle duration .",
    "the last term in equation ( [ q ] ) represents the amount of cells coming from the proliferating phase at division .",
    "they are in fact quiescent cells introduced in the proliferating phase one generation earlier .",
    "the factor 2 represents the division of each proliferating cell in two daughter cells .    at the end of their development",
    ", precursors give birth to mature blood cells , which are introduced in the bloodstream .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the population of circulating mature blood cells .",
    "these cells only proceed from @xmath6 cells at the rate @xmath27 .",
    "mature blood cells are degraded , in the bloodstream , at a rate @xmath28 .",
    "red blood cells usually live an average of 120 days , whereas platelets live about one week and white blood cells only few hours .",
    "mature blood cell population satisfies the differential equation @xmath29    the growth factor concentration is governed by a differential equation with an explicit negative feedback .",
    "this feedback describes the control of the bone marrow production on the growth factor production , explained in the previous section .",
    "this control acts by the mean of circulating blood cells : the more circulating blood cells the less growth factor produced .",
    "we denote by @xmath30 the feedback control .",
    "the function @xmath30 depends on the population of circulating cells @xmath31 and is positive , decreasing and continuously differentiable .",
    "then @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the disappearance rate of the growth factor .",
    "in fact , the action of the mature blood cell population on the production of growth factor is not immediate : it is slightly delayed , but this delay is negligible in front of the cell cycle duration , so we do not mention it .    at this point , one can notice that system ( [ q])([p ] ) is not coupled : the population in the proliferating phase is not needed in the description of the hematopoiesis process , since circulating blood cells only come from quiescent cells . from a mathematical point of view , the solution of ( [ q ] ) does not depend on the solution of ( [ p ] ) whereas the converse is not true .",
    "consequently , we concentrate on the system of delay differential equations @xmath34    first , one can notice that the solutions @xmath7 , @xmath26 and @xmath22 of system ( [ system ] ) are nonnegative .",
    "let us suppose , by contradiction , that there exists @xmath35 and @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 . then , since @xmath14 , @xmath42 this yields a contradiction .",
    "hence @xmath7 is nonnegative .",
    "since the functions @xmath13 and @xmath30 are nonnegative , we similarly obtain that @xmath26 and @xmath22 are nonnegative .",
    "secondly , one can notice that the solutions of ( [ system ] ) are bounded when @xmath43 .",
    "we first concentrate on the solution @xmath22 . using a classical variation of constant formula ,",
    "we obtain , for @xmath44 , @xmath45 since the function @xmath30 is decreasing and bounded , we have @xmath46 this yields that , if @xmath47 , then @xmath48 and , if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 .",
    "consequently , @xmath22 is bounded .",
    "now we focus on the solution @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath51 is bounded then the mapping @xmath52 is bounded so we will obtain that @xmath26 is bounded using similar arguments than for the above case .",
    "let @xmath53 be a bound of @xmath54 and assume that @xmath55 , for all @xmath56 , and that @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath57 , then , since the mapping @xmath58 is decreasing and tends to zero at infinity , there exists @xmath59 such that @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 . if @xmath63 then this result holds for @xmath64 .",
    "we then set @xmath65 let @xmath66 be fixed and let @xmath67 . if @xmath68 , then @xmath69 on the other hand , if @xmath70 , then @xmath71 thus , @xmath72 we assume now , by contradiction , that @xmath73 .",
    "then there exists @xmath74 such that @xmath75 , \\quad \\textrm { and } \\quad q(t_0)>q_1.\\ ] ] since the function @xmath76 is increasing , we deduce , from ( [ propg ] ) , that @xmath77 we obtain a contradiction so @xmath51 is bounded .",
    "these results are stated in the following proposition .",

    "then the solutions of system ( [ system ] ) are bounded .",
    "a solution @xmath78 of ( [ system ] ) is a steady - state or equilibrium if @xmath79 that is @xmath80 we make some remarks .",
    "it would be nonsense to suppose that the rates @xmath81 and @xmath82 may vanish , because we can not allow the blood cell population to grow indefinitely and growth factor is necessarily degraded while in blood .",

    "the above proposition indicates that system ( [ system ] ) undergoes a transcritical bifurcation when @xmath110 . since the trivial steady - state @xmath85 corresponds , biologically , to the extinction of the cell population and a saturation of the growth factor concentration , it is not the more interesting equilibrium .",
