    "in a seminal paper published in 1990 , datta and das @xcite proposed a gate controlled electron spin interferometer which is an analog of the standard electro - optic light modulator .",
    "their device ( later dubbed `` spin field effect transistor '' or spinfet ) consists of a one - dimensional semiconductor channel with ferromagnetic source and drain contacts ( fig .",
    "[ structure](a ) ) .",
    "electrons are injected into the channel from the ferromagnetic source with a definite spin orientation , which is then controllably precessed in the channel with a gate - controlled rashba interaction @xcite , and finally sensed at the drain . at the drain end ,",
    "the electron s transmission probability depends on the relative alignment of its spin with the drain s ( fixed ) magnetization . by controlling the angle of spin precession in the channel with a gate voltage",
    ", one can modulate the relative spin alignment at the drain end , and hence control the source - to - drain current ( or conductance ) .",
    "this is the principle of the spinfet .",
    "is the exchange splitting energy in the contacts .",
    "@xmath0 is the height of the potential barrier between the energy band bottoms of the semiconductor and the ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "@xmath0 takes into account the effects of the quantum confinement in the y- and z - directions .",
    "also shown as dashed lines are the resonant energy states above @xmath0 .",
    "peaks in the conductance of the electron spin interferometer are expected when the fermi level in the contacts lines up with the resonant states .",
    "the barriers at the ferromagnet / semiconductor interface are modeled as simple one - dimensional delta - potentials.,width=240 ]    there have been some studies of spin transport in such a device .",
    "mireles and kirczenow @xcite carried out a study of _ ballistic _ spin transport , but they overlooked two crucial features that are always present in a real device structure .",
    "first , there is an axial magnetic field along the channel caused by the ferromagnetic source and drain contacts which are magnetized in the same direction",
    ". this field can be quite strong ( @xmath1 1 tesla ) @xcite and dramatically alters the dispersion relations of the subbands in the channel , causes spin mixing , and has a serious effect on spin transport .",
    "second , there will always be a few impurities in the channel ( even if they are remote impurities ) associated with channel doping or unintentional defects .",
    "we show that even a single ( non - magnetic ) impurity can cause spin relaxation in the presence of the axial magnetic field .",
    "we first consider the quasi one - dimensional semiconductor channel of a spinfet in the absence of any impurities .",
    "the channel is along the x - axis ( fig .",
    "[ structure](a ) ) and the gate electric field is applied along the y - direction to induce a rashba spin - orbit coupling in the channel .",
    "this system is described by the single particle effective - mass hamiltonian @xcite @xmath2 \\label{hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the unit vector along the y - direction in fig .",
    "[ structure](a ) and @xmath4 is the vector potential due to the axial magnetic field @xmath5 along the channel ( x - direction ) caused by the ferromagnetic contacts . in ( 1 ) , @xmath6 is the bohr magneton ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 is the effective land g - factor of the electron in the channel .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 is the rashba spin - orbit coupling strength which can be varied with the gate potential .",
    "the confining potentials along the y- and z - directions are denoted by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with the latter being parabolic in space .    in ( 1 )",
    ", @xmath12 represents an interfacial potential barrier between the ferromagnetic contacts and the semiconducting channel .",
    "if the contact neighborhood consists of heavily doped semiconductor material in close proximity to a metallic ferromagnet , the schottky barriers at the interface will be very narrow and electrons from the contacts can tunnel fairly easily into semiconducting channel resulting in a nearly - ohmic contact .",
    "we model these ultra - narrow schottky barriers as delta - barriers given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are assumed equal ( @xmath16 = @xmath17 = @xmath18 ) . in practice , the strength of the barrier depends on the ferromagnetic materials and also on the doping level in the channel .",
    "these barriers have a beneficial effect ; they can facilitate coherent spin injection across a metallic ferromagnet and a semiconducting paramagnet interface @xcite which is crucial for the spinfet .    in ( 1 )",
    ", we have neglected a few effects for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we have neglected the normal elliott - yafet interaction @xcite because it is weak in quasi one - dimensional structures ( where elastic scattering is strongly suppressed ) .",
    "we have also neglected the dresselhaus interaction @xcite since it does not relax spin when the initial spin polarization is along the axis of the wire @xcite .",
    "the dresselhaus interaction can however be easily included in the hamiltonian and is left for future work .",
    "the choice of the landau gauge @xmath4 = ( 0 , -bz , 0 ) allows us to decouple the y - component of the hamiltonian in ( 1 ) from the x - z component .",
    "furthermore , in the absence of any impurity scattering potential ( @xmath19 ) , the hamiltonian in the semiconducting channel is translationally invariant in the x - direction and the wavevector @xmath20 is a good quantum number .",
    "the eigenstates of the system can then be determined using plane waves traveling in the x - direction @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional hamiltonian in the plane of the channel ( x - z plane ) is therefore given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the curvature of the confining potential in the z - direction , @xmath23 , and @xmath0 is the potential barrier between the ferromagnet and semiconductor .",
    "we assume that @xmath0 includes the effects of the quantum confinement in the y - direction ( fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "to model localized non - magnetic impurities ( i.e. , which do not by themselves flip the spin ) we use a standard model of delta - scatterers @xmath24 for an impurity located at a distance @xmath25 from the left ferromagnet / semiconductor interface with scattering strength @xmath26 ( assumed to be spin independent ) . in our numerical examples",
    ", we consider the case of both attractive ( @xmath26 negative ) and repulsive ( @xmath26 positive ) impurities . while ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) represent a ballistic channel with no scattering , addition of the scattering potential in ( 4 ) to ( 1 ) or ( 3 ) will result in a hamiltonian describing a weakly disordered channel in which impurity scattering takes place .",
    "the eigenstates of this ( spin - dependent ) hamiltonian can then be found using a transfer matrix technique to extract the electron wavefunction . from this wavefunction",
    ", we can calculate the ( spin - dependent ) transmission probability through the channel and ultimately the ( spin - dependent ) channel conductance .",
    "the details of the calculations have been presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the linear response conductance of the spin interferometer ( for injection from either the + x or -x polarized bands in the left contact ) is found from the landauer formula .",
    "we model the ferromagnetic contacts by the stoner - wohlfarth model ( fig.1.(b ) ) .",
    "the + x - polarized spin ( majority carrier ) and -x - polarized spin ( minority carrier ) band bottoms are offset by an exchange splitting energy @xmath27 .",
    "the solutions of the schrdinger equation for injection from minority and majority spins from the left magnetic contact then be written throughout the entire device leading to the corresponding transmission probabilities and the conductance of the interferometer based on the landauer formula ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the strength of the barrier at the ferromagnet / semiconductor interface is characterized by the following parameter @xmath28 typical values of @xmath29 vary in the range of 0 to 2 @xcite . using @xmath30 and @xmath31 = 1.05x@xmath32 @xmath33 , we get a barrier strength @xmath18 = 16 ev@xmath34 for z = 2 .",
    "we consider a spin interferometer consisting of a quasi one - dimensional inas channel between two ferromagnetic contacts .",
    "the electrostatic potential in the z - direction is assumed to be harmonic ( with @xmath35 = 10 mev in ( 3 ) .",
    "a zeeman splitting energy of 0.34 mev is used in the semiconductor channel assuming a magnetic field b = 1 tesla along the channel .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath36 factor of 3 and an electron effective mass @xmath37 which is typical of inas - based channels @xcite .",
    "the fermi level @xmath38 and the exchange splitting energy @xmath39 in the ferromagnetic contacts are set equal to 4.2 and 3.46 ev , respectively @xcite .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath40 is typically derived from low - temperature magnetoresistance measurements ( shubnikov - de haas oscillations ) in 2deg created at the interface of semiconductor heterostructures @xcite . to date , the largest reported experimental values of the rashba spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath40 has been found in inas - based semiconductor heterojunctions . for a normal hemt @xmath41 heterojunction , sato et al .",
    "have reported variation of @xmath40 from 30- to 15 @xmath42 ev - m when the external gate voltage is swept from 0 to -6 v ( the total electron concentration in the 2deg is found to be reduced from 5- to 4.5@xmath43 over the same range of bias ) .",
    "tuning the gate voltage varies both the potential energy barrier @xmath0 and the rashba spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath9 . both of these variations lead to distinct types of conductance oscillations .",
    "the variation of @xmath0 causes the fermi - level in the channel to sweep through the resonant energies in the channel , causing the conductance to oscillate .",
    "these are known as ramsauer oscillations and have been examined by us in detail in @xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath9 , on the other hand , causes spin precession in the channel leading to the type of conductance oscillation which is the basis of the spin interferometer , as originally visualized by datta and das @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we found that the ramsauer oscillations are much stronger and can mask the oscillations due to spin precession , unless the structure is designed with particular care to eliminate ( or reduce ) the ramsauer oscillations .    in the numerical examples below",
    ", we assumed that the rashba spin - orbit coupling strength @xmath40 is constant ( i.e. , independent of the gate potential ) and equal to the maximum reported value of 30 @xmath42 ev - m ( best case scenario ) .",
    "we also used a value of z = 0.25 corresponding to a value of @xmath14 and @xmath17 in ( 2 ) equal to 2 ev-@xmath34 .",
    "the scattering strength of the single impurity in the channel was set equal to @xmath44 = @xmath45 0.25 ev-@xmath34 ( the plus and minus sign corresponding to repulsive and attractive impurity , respectively ) .",
    "first , we consider the case of a single repulsive scatterer ( impurity ) whose location is varied from the left to the rigth side of the channel in steps of 10 @xmath34 .",
    "figure 2 shows that variation of the conductance with the impurity location for three different values of @xmath46 in the channel , i.e , gate potential on the spinfet .",
    "it is seen that the condutance of the interferometer is a strong function of the impurity location .",
    "figure 2 shows that the condutance modulation ( difference between maximum and minimum conductance values ) of the interferometer is about 0.9 , 0.21 , and 0.2 @xmath47 , for @xmath0 equal to 4.191 , 4.188 , and 4.185 ev , respectively .",
    "the same calculation were repeated for the case of an attractive impurity with the same magnitude of the scattering strength and the conductance modulation as a function of the impurity location are shown in fig.3 . in this case , the condutance modulation ( difference between maximum and minimum conductance values ) of the interferometer is about 0.76 , 0.16 , and 0.17@xmath47 , for @xmath0 equal to 4.191 , 4.188 , and 4.185 ev , respectively .",
    "in this paper , we have shown how the conductance of gate controlled spin interferometers proposed in @xcite is strongly dependent on the location of a single impurity in the semiconducting channel ( figs . 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the extreme sensitivity of the amplitude and phase of conductance oscillations of a spinfet to impurity location is reminiscent of the phenomenon of universal conductance fluctuations of mesoscopic samples @xcite .",
    "this will hinder practical applications of electron spin interferometers since it will lead to such problems as large threshold variability , random device characteristics , and general irreproducibility .",
