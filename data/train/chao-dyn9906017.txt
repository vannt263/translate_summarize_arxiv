    "[ omino ]    playing on a rectangular billiard with just one ball can be a boring experience , in particular when the ball is represented by a point : given any starting position , the corresponding orbit is dense on the billiard for almost all directions , whereas for a countable set of initial angles all orbits are periodic .",
    "we can make the game a little more interesting if we use a generic polygonal billiard .    in more generality ,",
    "billiards are dynamical systems defined by the uniform motion of a point inside a piecewise - differentiable planar domain _ ( the table ) _ , with elastic reflections at the boundary .",
    "this means that the tangential component of the velocity remains constant and the normal component changes sign @xcite .",
    "a polygonal table is called _ rational _ when the angles between the sides are all of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are integers .",
    "these billiards have the nice property that any orbit will have only a finite number of different angles of reflection @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", there is a natural _ unfolding _ procedure @xcite which allows one to map any given trajectory on the table to an orbit of a vector field over a surface having a certain genus .",
    "[ remark2 ] usually one assumes that the magnitude of the particle s velocity equals one , and that the   which hits a vertex stops there . for our model ,",
    "though , we will slightly modify this second assumption , since it is possible to continue uniquely every trajectory for all values of @xmath9 ( see later ) .",
    "either way , the set of initial conditions whose s do not contain any vertices is always a set of full measure  in the phase space .",
    "the aforementioned rational condition implies in particular a decomposition of the phase space in a family of flow - invariant surfaces @xmath10 . excluding the special cases @xmath11",
    ", it is known that the billiard  flow restricted to any of the @xmath12 is essentially equivalent to a geodesic flow @xmath13 on a closed oriented surface @xmath14 , endowed with a flat riemannian metric with _ conical _ singularities @xcite .",
    "based on this fundamental idea , many important and deep results have been proven , with the crucial aid of some highly non - trivial mathematical techniques . in particular , the theory of quadratic differentials over riemann surfaces , the theory of interval exchange transformations ( using the induced map on the boundary ) and the method of approximating irrational billiards with rational ones , have altogether turned out to be very effective to understand the dynamics of polygonal billiards .",
    "references @xcite give a complete account of the state - of - the - art in this field , and @xcite , of which this paper is a follow - up , contains a compact reference list .",
    "here we limit ourselves to recall only those results that will be of immediate use in the rest of the paper :    * @xcite the lebesgue measure  in a ( finite ) rational polygon is the unique ergodic measure  for the billiard  flow , for ( lebesgue-)almost all directions .",
    "moreover , for all but countably many directions , a rational polygonal billiard  is _ minimal _",
    "( i.e. , all infinite semi - s are dense ) .",
    "in particular , for _ almost integrable _ billiards , `` minimal directions '' and `` ergodic directions '' coincide @xcite .",
    "( roughly , an almost integrable billiard  is a billiardwhose table is a finite connected union of pieces belonging to a tiling of the plane by reflection , e.g , a rectangular tiling , or a tiling by equilateral triangles , etc.see @xcite for more precise statements . ) * @xcite for every @xmath15 , in the space of @xmath15-gons there is a dense @xmath16-subset of ergodic  tables . * @xcite for any given polygon , the metric entropy with respect to any flow - invariant measure is zero .",
    "furthermore , the topological entropy is also zero . *",
    "@xcite given an arbitrary polygon and an  , either the   is periodic or its closure contains at least one vertex .",
    "all of these results , however , fail to hold when we introduce further complications : an infinite number of sides ( an interesting example is the `` staircase '' compact billiard  briefly mentioned in @xcite , while the inspiring paper by troubetzkoy @xcite discusses the general case ) , or non - compact tables ( one might take a look at @xcite , although they are not about flat polygonal billiards ) .",
    "in @xcite we introduced a family of ( seemingly ) simple models that have both properties : the _ infinite step billiards _",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]    for them , it turns out that one of the first non - obvious questions to treat is exactly what our friend that likes playing pool more than handling groups of automorphisms would like to know : depending on how i initially hit the ball , can i be sure it will come back at all ?",
    "in other words , since the system is _ open _ it makes sense to ask how many s actually keep returning to the `` bulk '' of the systems rather than _",
    "escaping_. as a matter of fact this was one of our main motivations in @xcite . in the one example we treated in detail there , we found that the fact that there is a unique escape orbit  for a.a .",
    "directions has very interesting implications for the dynamics of the entire billiard : specifically , this   is somehow an `` attractor '' for the system .",
    "we will re - state this more precisely in section [ result - top - dyn ] .",
    "here we consider the whole class of infinite step billiards and we will see that playing on these tables can be rather challenging , even if we pay the price that sometimes we have to wait a _",
    "little bit _ before our ball comes back .",
    "it turns out that the above result on the uniqueness of the escape orbit  can be extended  together with its corollaries  to a wide set of billiards in our class .",
    "for these tables , the typical situation is that the ball keeps returning to the leftmost wall , although each time it might stretch arbitrarily far to the right , following the unique , ill - behaved , escaping trajectory .",
    "this is basically what theorem [ thm - unique ] and related statements assert  see in particular proposition [ prop - from - ddl ] .",
    "( incidentally , we are pleased to attest that further work in this direction is in progress @xcite . )    more theoretically , one would like to know better about the ergodic properties of these systems ( at least of many of them ) .",
    "recently troubetzkoy @xcite treated the case of an arbitrary polygon with an infinite number of sides , proving interesting results regarding both the topological structure ( e.g. , poincar recurrence theorem and existence of periodic trajectories ) and the ergodicity .",
    "in particular , he showed that the _ typical _ bounded infinite polygon has ergodic directional flows for almost all angles .",
    "the notion of typicality as first used by @xcite is now customary ( see also @xcite ) : in a certain topological ( usually metric ) space there exists a dense @xmath17-set of billiards with that property .",
    "the metric used in @xcite requires several conditions to be verified before two polygons can be considered close : their shapes are to be very similar , of course , but also the two flows are to keep close for a long time , for many initial conditions .",
    "( not that one could do much better .",
    "in fact , it is not hard to imagine two infinite polygons that look alike but have completely different dynamics  which is exactly the point in @xcite when the staircase model is presented . )",
    "the other results in this paper apply the ideas of @xcite .",
    "we show that generic ergodicity holds for the family of _ unbounded _ , finite - volume , billiards in our class ( theorem [ gigitheorem ] ) .",
    "the metric we employ , however , is very simple and can be expressed in terms of `` easily measurable '' quantities .",
    "also , we prove that the entropy of the billiard  is zero w.r.t .",
    "any invariant ergodic  measure  that verifies a cartain finiteness condition ( proposition [ entropy ] ) .",
    "the topological entropy , too , is probably zero ( at least for many of these systems ) but , due to the non - compactness of the table , the usual variational principle can not be applied directly and one must check some additional conditions @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the basic notation ( referring the reader to @xcite for a more detailed presentation of the systems in question ) , we give some quick proofs , and we present the precise statements of our results . the main proofs",
    "are then distributed in the following sections .",

    "in this paper we are interested in a class of rational billiards , the _ infinite step billiards _ , defined as follows : let @xmath18 be a monotonically vanishing sequence of non - negative numbers , with @xmath19 ( we will later relax this inessential last condition ) .",
    "we denote @xmath20 \\times [ 0,p_{n}]$ ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) and we call @xmath21 the two coordinates on it .    a point particle can travel within @xmath22 only in four directions ( two if the motion is vertical or horizontal  cases which we disregard ) .",
    "one of these directions lies in the first quadrant . for @xmath230,\\pi/2[$ ] , the invariant surface associated to the billiard flow is labeled by @xmath24 ( or just by @xmath12 , when there is no means of confusion ) . this manifold is built via the usual unfolding procedure with four copies of @xmath22 .",

    "@xmath24 can be considered a non - compact , finite - area surface of infinite genus .",
    "in @xcite we used @xmath32 to denote the invariant surface for a given @xmath33 .",
    "more importantly , we measured the directions w.r.t .  the lebesgue measure  for @xmath340,+\\infty[$ ] .",
    "however , this is equivalent to the normalized lebesgue measure  for @xmath350,\\pi/2[$ ] . in this paper",
    "we use angles except in section [ escape ] , where it is convenient to do otherwise",

    "the corresponding invariant surface , of genus @xmath15 , will be denoted by @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "some statements about @xmath36 have immediate consequences for the infinite table @xmath22 .",
    "for instance :     for the truncated billiard.,width=384 ]    [ fig3 ]    in an infinite step billiard  @xmath22 , for almost all @xmath8 , all semi - s are unbounded , whereas periodic and unbounded trajectories can coexist for a zero - measure  set of directions .",

    "hence @xmath48 ( the superscript @xmath49 denoting the complementary set w.r.t .  a certain space ) .",
    "we found that we had one or two escape orbits for every angle .",
    "so , for some _ rational directions _ ( @xmath50 ) , periodic s coexisted with escape orbits , which are obviously unbounded .",
    "less trivially , given any arbitrary rational direction , we showed ( in sec .",
    "1.2 ) how to construct a table with @xmath51 and with at least one _ oscillating _ trajectory ( this means unbounded and non - escaping , according to the terminology of @xcite ) .",
    "playing with that example , it is not hard to show that we can indeed find a billiard  with at least one periodic and one oscillating  .",
