    "the double - exchange ( de ) model has been studied intensively to explain ferromagnetic transition in colossal - magnetoresistance manganites .",
    "@xcite the origin of the metallic ferromagnetism in these materials is well explained by the de mechanism .",
    "@xcite recently , numerical calculations have demonstrated that fluctuations through the strong interplay between spin and charge degrees of freedom play a crucial role in this system . @xcite through precise calculations of the ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath1 , the de model is shown to give a quantitative description of the ferromagnetic transition in the typical material la@xmath2sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 near @xmath5 .",
    "this provides a well - established starting point toward comprehensive understanding of rich variety of physics in the manganites through quantitative comparisons between experiments and theories .    to this canonical de",
    "ferromagnetic state , there are various perturbations in experiments , for instance , control of chemical compositions , external pressure and magnetic field .",
    "@xcite it is important to clarify these effects theoretically in order to understand experiments where the perturbations may be entangled and act on in a complicated manner . among them , we study effects of the randomness in this paper . since mixed - valence manganites are synthesized as solid solutions , randomness is inevitably contained in these compounds .",
    "we discuss how the ferromagnetic transition is affected by the randomness .",
    "the randomness effect for @xmath1 in the de system has been studied theoretically .",
    "stability of the ferromagnetic state is studied by the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) , and a decrease of @xmath1 due to the randomness is predicted .",
    "@xcite in this work , we go beyond the approximation and use a numerical technique which is essentially exact . spatial random distribution of impurities is taken into account properly in this method . since the spatial fluctuations which are neglected in the cpa are known to be important in the case without disorder , @xcite the unbiased calculations are necessary also for the systems with disorder to discuss the quantitative change of @xmath1 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section [ sec : model ] introduces the de model with disorder and describes the numerical methods briefly . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the results for the approximately - estimated critical temperature are discussed for the cases with randomness in comparison with the results for the pure system . sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to summary and concluding remarks .",
    "in this work , we consider a simple model with a diagonal disorder in the framework of the de model . the hamiltonian is explicitly given by @xmath6 where the first term denotes the nearest - neighbor hopping on the cubic lattice and the second term is for the hunds - rule coupling .",
    "the last term denotes the on - site randomness which modifies the one - body potential energy in each site .",
    "the potential @xmath7 takes @xmath8 in equal probability in each site .",
    "the physical quantities are calculated by the random average for the quenched disorder . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the limits of @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the quarter - filled case which shows a maximum of @xmath1 in the pure case .",
    "we apply the monte carlo ( mc ) method to the model ( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "@xcite in this method , the mc weight to update a configuration of the localized moments are calculated quantum - mechanically by integrating out the fermion degrees of freedom . for large - size clusters ,",
    "the difficulty of a rapid increase of the computational time has been solved by using the moment - expansion mc method .",
    "@xcite the moment expansion as well as the random average is performed quite efficiently on parallel computer systems .    in the following , we use an energy unit @xmath11 which is the half bandwidth for the pure system . for a given configuration of disorder , we have typically run @xmath12 mc samplings for measurements after @xmath12 mc steps for thermalization .",
    "the random average is taken for @xmath13 random configurations .",
    "before going to the cases with randomness , we review and discuss the ferromagnetic transition in the pure case ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "@xcite figure  [ fig : mvst , pure ] shows the results for the temperature dependence of the magnetization for @xmath15 .",
    "we present the data for finite - size clusters and those for the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the latter is obtained by the finite - size scaling analysis . from the onset of the magnetization in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath1 is estimated as @xmath16 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mvst , pure ] indicates that in order to obtain the precise estimate of @xmath1 , a systematic study of the finite - size effects is crucial , which needs much computational effort .",
    "we note , however , that it is possible to define a characteristic temperature even for a fixed - size cluster .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetization for each finite - size cluster is a monotonic function and has an inflection point .",
    "we adopt this inflection point as the characteristic temperature @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : inflection ] , we plot the system - size dependence of @xmath0 which is obtained from the numerical differentiation of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvst , pure ] . within the error bars",
    ", @xmath0 is almost independent of the system size and agrees with @xmath1 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , @xmath0 for a finite - size cluster is expected to give a good approximation for @xmath1 in this pure case .",
    "we expect that this observation holds also for the systems with randomness below",
    ". note that at least , since @xmath0 must be an independent parameter to characterize the temperature scale for the ferromagnetic transition , it should be justified to discuss the stability of the ferromagnetism by @xmath0 .",
    "now we discuss the randomness effect .",
    "figure  [ fig : mvst , disorder ] shows the magnetization curve for the system size of @xmath17 sites when we change the value of @xmath18 .",
    "the magnetization decreases as the disorder strength @xmath18 increases .",
    "this indicates that the ferromagnetism is suppressed by the randomness .",
    "the decrease is the most significant near @xmath19 .",
    "this is probably because near the critical point , the fluctuations are dominant and the coherence of the itinerant electrons becomes very sensitive to the randomness .",
    "based on the discussion in the pure case , we examine the stability of the ferromagnetism in the systems with randomness by @xmath0 . figure  [ fig : tc , disorder ] shows @xmath0 as a function of @xmath18 which is estimated from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvst , disorder ] . as the critical temperature in the previous cpa results , @xcite the approximated critical temperature @xmath0 decreases as @xmath18 increases .",
    "our mc data , however , show larger decrease in comparison with the cpa results : for instance , for @xmath20 , our data show about @xmath21% decrease , while the cpa results show less than @xmath22% decrease .",
    "the cpa takes account of the randomness in an averaged way through the change of the density of states . in our mc study",
    ", the spatial distribution of the randomness as well as its effect on the coherence of electrons is included properly .",
    "our data suggest that the spatial fluctuations are important and the suppression of @xmath1 is stronger than expected from the band renormalization in the cpa .",
    "we have investigated the randomness effect on the ferromagnetic transition in the double - exchange model .",
    "we consider the model with on - site diagonal disorder .",
    "the spatial distribution of the randomness and large fluctuations inherent in this strongly - correlated system are taken into account properly by using the monte carlo method .",
    "the randomness suppresses the ferromagnetism of the double - exchange origin by reducing the coherence of the electron motion .",
    "our results indicate that the suppression is significant in the critical region where the fluctuations are dominant .",
    "we have examined the characteristic temperature scale which is expected to give a good approximation for the critical temperature .",
    "the approximated critical temperature tends to be suppressed by the randomness as predicted by the coherent - potential approximation .",
    "our monte carlo results , however , show a more rapid decrease than the previous results .",
    "this may be attributed to the spatial fluctuations by the randomness distribution which is included only in an averaged manner in the previous approximations .",
    "the randomness effects are studied only for a small - size cluster in this paper .",
    "the estimated temperature @xmath0 is an approximation for @xmath1 .",
    "calculations for larger - size systems and more precise determination of the critical temperature including the finite - size scaling are under investigation .",
    "different distribution of the randomness is also examined and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the authors thank h. nakata for helpful support in developing parallel - processing systems .",
    "the computations have been performed mainly using the facilities in the aoyama+ project ( http://www.phys.aoyama.ac.jp/~aoyama+ ) and in the supercomputer center , institute for solid state physics , university of tokyo .",
