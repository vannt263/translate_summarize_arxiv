    "a great deal of attention has been devoted to the analysis of possible effects of the spacetime anisotropy @xcite . in the context of quantum field theory ( qft ) , this possibility appears as a tool to study nonrenormalizable theories since it improves the ultraviolet behavior of the perturbative series , in spite of violating the lorentz symmetry which in its turn has been considered in several situations @xcite .    the different behavior between space and time coordinates @xmath0 , @xmath1  @xcite , ameliorates the ultraviolet behavior and",
    "it has been argued that four - dimensional gravity becomes renormalizable when @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , the implementation of this kind of anisotropy introduces unusual aspects and therefore it is important to carefully investigate the consequences of this new approach @xcite .",
    "one special situation concerns the chern - simons ( cs ) term @xcite : when it is added to quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) lagrangian , the generation of mass for the gauge field happens without gauge symmetry breaking and it naturally emerges from quantum corrections to the gauge field propagator @xcite . beyond that , applications have been devised into diverse areas @xcite . therefore , the study of the spacetime anisotropy on the theories involving the cs term is certainly relevant .    in this work",
    "we will analyze the new contributions to the self - energy of the gauge field in the @xmath3 case up to one loop order in the small momenta regime .",
    "in particular , corrections to the cs term will be studied . on general grounds",
    "we expect that the leading cs corrections have following form : @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the laplacian . in an interesting work @xcite where the isotropic spacetime was considered , a cs term with structure similar to ( [ csexpec ] )",
    "was employed . there , the laplacian was replaced by a dalambertian and @xmath6 , so that the gauge propagator shows two massive excitations , one of them being a ghost like .    by starting from ( [ csexpec ] ) with @xmath7 , so that there is at most one time derivative , and adding the maxwell term , @xmath8 we obtain the propagator @xmath9}\\left(g^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac{k^\\mu k^\\nu}{k^2}-\\frac{i(a - b\\vec{k}^2)\\epsilon^{\\mu\\rho\\nu}k_\\rho}{k^2}\\right)+\\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{ik^\\mu k^\\nu}{\\lambda k^2[k^2-(a - b\\vec{k}^2)^2 ] } + \\frac{i(a - b\\vec{k}^2)^2 k^\\mu k^\\nu}{\\lambda k^2[k^2-(a - b\\vec{k}^2)^2]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which does not contain particle like poles and , for small momenta , indicates disturbances propagating with squared velocity @xmath10 . in this work",
    "we will also check the consistency with respect to the gauge symmetry of these corrections through the verification of the transversality of the self - energy contributions to the gauge field propagator .",
    "our calculations show that , analogously to the relativistic situation , although finite the coefficient @xmath11 is regularization dependent .",
    "actually , if dimensional reduction ( see appendix [ appendixb ] ) is employed , the constant @xmath11 turns out to be equal to zero whereas in the relativistic situation it is nonvanishing .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ anisotropic ] we introduce high derivative terms in the dirac and maxwell lagrangians and analyze the cs generation and the characteristics of the self - energy of the gauge field .",
    "for simplicity , our calculations will be restricted to small momenta regime . in sec .",
    "[ current ] we discuss the transversality of the corrections to the gauge field propagator .",
    "[ remarks ] presents some concluding remarks .",
    "two appendices are dedicated to detail some aspects of the calculations .",
    "the modified dirac lagrangian , containing a high spatial derivative of second order is @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 is the covariant derivative and @xmath16 indicates a @xmath17 representation of the dirac gamma matrices . to obtain the qed lagrangian we add to ( [ lda ] ) the maxwell term with high derivatives : @xmath18 in which @xmath19 .",
    "the above contribution exhibits a mixture among space and time components , which may cause complications on the calculations involving the gauge field propagator .",
    "it is possible to avoid the mixed propagators by conveniently choosing the gauge fixing  @xcite . as the gauge field propagator",
    "does not appear in our calculations we will keep an inespecific gauge fixing , @xmath20 . despite of the mixing terms or gauge choice , notice that the determination of the transversal and longitudinal parts of the gauge field propagator is highly non trivial in anisotropic theory , thus we will dedicate a section to an analyses of the transversality of the corrections to the gauge field propagator .",
    "we can rewrite ( [ lda ] ) and define the dirac anisotropic lagrangian @xmath21 and , up to irrelevant surface terms , the interaction lagrangian @xmath22 such that the total lagrangian is @xmath23 . in",
    "( [ lag - anisoi ] ) we introduced a notation for the vertices where , @xmath24 , etc .",
    "these vertices , fixed by @xmath25 , are graphically represented in fig.([vertices ] ) . for the free fermion propagator",
    "we obtain @xmath26 where the hat and the bar denotes the time and space components , respectively , i.e. , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( we will also use the notations @xmath30 and @xmath31 , thus @xmath32 ) .     and @xmath33 components , respectively . the diagram ( a ) is the trilinear vertex with two fermion fields and the @xmath34 component .",
    "figure ( b ) is the vertex with two fermion fields and the @xmath33 component ; besides that , it may contain a spatial derivative .",
    "graph ( c ) is the quadrilinear vertex with two fermion fields and two @xmath33 components .",
    ", height=132 ]    , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the diagram ( d ) contains the quadrilinear vertex with @xmath36 external fields.,height=188 ]    the corrections to the gauge field propagator at one loop , are represented in fig.([2pts ] ) whose analytical expressions are @xmath37,\\\\ \\pi_{5}^{ij}=    c_5\\int d^z\\hat{k}d^d\\bar{k}tr[\\gamma^i\\gamma^js(k)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the time or spatial component @xmath39 associated to the vertices defined as in  ( [ lag - anisoi ] ) , thus @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the momentum independent coefficient correspondent to each amplitude .",
    "the development of these expressions are discussed in appendices [ appendixb ] and [ appendixa ] .    by power",
    "counting we find : the diagram ( [ 2pts]_c _ ) is linearly or logarithmically divergent if the vertex attached to the wavy line has or does not have a derivative ; the divergences of the diagram ( [ 2pts]_b _ ) are quadratic if both vertices have one derivative , linear when one vertex has a derivative and none in the other and finally logarithmic when none derivative appears in the vertices just like in the fig .",
    "( [ 2pts]_a _ ) , which is composed by two external @xmath42 components .    in the sequel we will consider the small momenta regime and taylor expand the self - energy corrections . the usual cs term ( i.e. the first term in ( [ csexpec ] ) ) is obtained from the first order terms on the taylor derivative expansion while the extended cs term ( which have a form like the second and third terms in ( [ csexpec ] ) ) is given by the third order terms .",
    "considering that the highest divergence is quadratic , the extended cs contributions , which are of third order on taylor expansion , are of course finite .",
    "differently , for the usual cs terms , the algebra reduces the degree of divergence of some diagrams only to logarithmic so that they requires the introduction of a regularization scheme . similarly to the relativistic theory , in the sense that there is a regularization dependence , there is an ambiguity on the induced cs term .    for the even terms in the momentum expansion , which do not contribute to the cs terms",
    ", the integration on momenta furnishes hypergeometric functions , as indicated in the appendix [ appendixb ] . in this case , the divergences are characterized by the schwinger parameter , @xmath43 , which receives contributions from the hypergeometric and from the coefficients associated to them ( see eq .",
    "[ hypergeo ] ) . to integrate on the @xmath43 parameter",
    ", we will power expand the hypergeometric for small @xmath43 and @xmath44 , until its exponent becomes nonnegative .",
    "observe that , here the isotropic limit , @xmath45 , can not be taken singly because it is inconsistent with the small @xmath43 expansion . however , although the divergent terms individually exhibit poles for @xmath44 , they are canceled when summed to produce the total self - energy correction , allowing for a smooth isotropic limit .",
    "the conservation of the noether s current @xmath46 @xmath47+eb_2\\left[\\bar\\psi\\gamma^i\\gamma^k\\psi+\\bar\\psi\\gamma^k\\gamma^i\\psi\\right]a_i\\;.\\ ] ] allows us to prove the transversality of the self - energy corrections . indeed ,",
    "we may write the @xmath48 in terms of the above current @xmath49,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the first term , the argument of the current @xmath50 must be taken equal to zero .",
    "now , in computing of the self - energy contributions notice that it is equal to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the interaction action ; ( [ cucons ] ) must be transversal due to the conservation of the current .",
    "in this work we studied the effects of the anisotropy of the spacetime on the generation of the cs term and on the self - energy correction to the gauge field propagator .",
    "we proved that this correction is transversal by constructing the conserved noether s current which interacts with the gauge field .",
    "some interesting aspects of the calculation are related to the structure of the divergences . for the even part of the gauge field self - energy ,",
    "there are seven amplitudes involving the new vertices which are divergent and their pole terms break gauge invariance .",
    "nevertheless , a contribution coming from the usual vertices cancel these divergences .",
    "there are two types of cs terms that may be induced by the radiative corrections , the usual cs term which contains just one derivative and the extended cs term with three derivatives .",
    "whereas the second type of cs term is always finite , the usual one presents results which are divergent but these divergences notabily cancel among themselves when the total contribution is considered .",
    "furthermore , the coefficient of the usual cs term is regularization dependent and vanishes if dimensional reduction is adopted . in this situation ,",
    "one is forced to consider the extended cs term which constitute then the dominant contribution .    by referring to the usual cs terms , notice that the contributions coming from the usual vertices are finite , therefore free from ambiguities caused by the regularization .",
    "on the other hand , the contributions coming from the new vertices are regularization dependent . besides that",
    ", the explicit @xmath53 factor from that vertices is canceled because it is multiplied by amplitudes which diverge as @xmath54 , this furnishes non zero contributions when the isotropic limit is considered . consequently , the regularization dependence is restored and in the isotropic limit unexpected results , as the just mentioned vanishing of the usual cs term if dimensional reduction is employed , are obtained .    considering the extended cs , all amplitudes associated to it are finite even if @xmath54 .",
    "the isotropic limit for these terms is smooth remaining only the contributions coming from the usual vertices .    by considering the eqs .",
    "( [ geralij ] ) and ( [ geral0i ] ) , the induced cs terms can be written as @xmath55e^2b_1 ^ 2\\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho}p_{\\rho}}{48\\pi m^2(b_1 ^ 2 + 4mb_2)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in accord with our proposal ( [ csexpec ] ) .",
    "notice that the breaking of the lorentz invariance is a very simple function of @xmath56 and @xmath53 and that in the isotropic limit with @xmath57 the lorenz symmetry is restored .",

    "in this appendix we will describe the procedure employed to calculate the feynman diagrams . as an example",
    ", we will consider the amplitude given by the vertices @xmath58 and @xmath59 which leads us to : @xmath60.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to solve ( [ exemp ] ) we adopt the dimensional reduction scheme , in which all the algebra of the gamma matrices are done in @xmath44 and afterwards the integral is promoted to @xmath61 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the leading term in the taylor expansion , i.e. the term with @xmath62 is @xmath63}{(\\hat{k}^2-\\textbf{k}^2(b_1 ^ 2 + 2mb_2)-\\textbf{k}^4b_2 ^ 2-m^2)^2}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to perform the above integral , we use the schwinger s representation and integrate on the momenta .",
    "the result is very extensive , therefore we will consider just one of the terms which leads to a divergent result : @xmath64 where @xmath43 is the schwinger parameter and @xmath65 denotes the hypergeometric function . note that this function is divergent in the limit @xmath66 , so we will taylor expand it , up to a nonnegative power of @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath67 the final result is obtained by integrating on @xmath43 and expanding the result around @xmath44 , such that the general results for this amplitude is given by @xmath68 notice that this divergence is absent in the relativistic theory because it clearly comes from modifications introduced by the anisotropy .",
    "observe also that from the argument of the hypergeometric function in ( [ hypergeo ] ) that the isotropic limit , @xmath69 , is incompatible with the adopted expansion for @xmath66 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the subleading term in the taylor expansion , responsible for the usual cs term , i.e. @xmath70 , the result is @xmath71.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to compute the above integral , which is finite by power counting , we simply take @xmath44 and integrate on the momenta .",
    "in this appendix we will present the one loop contributions , for small momenta , to the self - energy of the gauge field . from the interaction lagrangian we observe that we have a total of 12 different amplitudes coming from the wick s contractions of the vertices .",
    "the sum of all contributions gives ( further details will be presented elsewhere ) : @xmath72e^2b_1 ^ 2\\epsilon^{ij0}\\hat{p}_0}{48\\pi m^2(b_1 ^ 2 + 4mb_2)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath73e^2b_1 ^ 2\\epsilon^{0ia}\\bar{p}_a}{48\\pi m^2(b_1 ^ 2 + 4mb_2)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are constant parameters introduced in ( [ geralij ] ) and ( [ geral0i ] ) , respectively , to denote the ambiguity coming from the regularization scheme .",
    "we may note that there is a cancellation of the usual cs term , remaining only regularization dependent terms .",
    "this occurs due to the contributions of the new vertices introduced by the anisotropy and by the fact that their @xmath53 vertex factor is eliminated after performing the momenta integrals .    in the isotropic limit @xmath45 of ( [ geralij ] ) and ( [ geral0i ] )",
    "all the extended cs terms coming from the new vertices contributions are cancelled and we get @xmath76 and @xmath77 by taken @xmath57 we obtain an expression similar to that one introduced in @xcite .",
