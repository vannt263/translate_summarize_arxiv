    "in recent years the power supply network is changing its role from a network used solely for energy distribution into a dual - purpose network which simultaneously supports both communications as well as power distribution . generally speaking , power line communication ( plc )",
    "can be classified into two types , according to its frequency band  @xcite .",
    "the first type is communication which utilizes low to medium frequencies ( up to 500 khz ) , this type is referred to as _",
    "narrowband plc_. such systems are used for applications of automation and control , including power management , smart homes , and automatic meter reading systems .",
    "the second type of communication uses the frequency band of 2mhz to 100mhz and possibly beyond  @xcite .",
    "this type is referred to as _ broadband plc _ , and is used for high - speed data communications including fast internet access and implementation of small lans .",
    "power line communications differs considerably in topology and physical properties from conventional wired communication media such as twisted pair , coaxial , or fiber - optic cables .",
    "one of the major differences is the characteristics of interference and noise which are much more dominant in plc than in other media  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the statistical properties of the additive power line noise are considerably different than the conventionally used additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) model  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "as detailed in  @xcite and further developed in  @xcite and  @xcite , power line noise can be modeled as a superposition of several noise sources :    * colored background noise : this is a low power noise whose power spectral density ( psd ) decreases with frequency .",
    "this noise results mainly from the summation of harmonics of the mains cycle . *",
    "narrowband noise : this noise consists of sinusoidal signals with modulated amplitudes , and is due to the operation of electrical appliances connected to the network ( e.g. , television related disturbances at high harmonics of the horizontal retrace frequency  @xcite ) . * impulsive noise : this noise consists of impulses of varying duration , and is generated mostly by power supplies in electrical appliances .",
    "there are three types of impulsive noise : ( 1 ) _ periodic impulsive noise synchronous with the ac cycle _ : this noise is caused by the rectifier diodes used in power supplies which operate synchronously with the mains cycle .",
    "the impulses are of short duration ( several microseconds ) and their power decreases with frequency .",
    "( 2 ) _ periodic impulsive noise asynchronous with the ac cycle _ :",
    "this noise is generated by switched - mode power supplies and ac / dc power converters , and has a cycle frequency that can vary between 50 to 200 khz .",
    "( 3 ) _ non - periodic impulsive noise _ :",
    "this noise is caused by switching transients . and has no periodic properties .",
    "the impulsive noise components are the most harmful for broadband plc  @xcite . for narrowband plc ,",
    "the colored background noise , the narrowband noise and the periodic impulsive noise synchronous with the ac frequency are the dominant noise components  @xcite ,  @xcite . due to the relatively long symbol duration in narrowband plc transmission",
    ", the periodic properties of the noise can not be ignored .",
    "one of the common models for the narrowband plc noise is based on the work of middleton in  @xcite , which models the noise probability density function ( pdf ) as a sum of gaussian pdfs of different variances , allowing to express several classes of impulsive noise by a simple function .",
    "this results in a non - gaussian noise model .",
    "the drawback of the middleton model is that it does not include time - domain features .",
    "this issue has been addressed in the work of katayama et al .",
    "@xcite , which proposed a time - domain cyclostationary noise model for the narrowband plc noise . a recent work  @xcite suggests an alternative cyclostationary noise model , obtained by applying a linear periodic time varying ( lptv ) system to a stationary gaussian stochastic process .",
    "both works model the noise as an additive cyclostationary gaussian noise ( acgn ) with a period of half the mains period .",
    "finally , we note that due to the relatively high power of the power line noise , narrowband plc typically operates at very low snrs  @xcite .    in the past several years",
    ", orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has been adopted for plc schemes in order to achieve high bandwidth efficiency .",
    "ofdm is particularly suitable for coping with the frequency selectivity of the power - line channel  @xcite .",
    "an ofdm plc modem structure was proposed as early as 1999  @xcite .",
    "the technology has been adopted by recent narrowband plc standardization efforts , ieee p1901.2  @xcite and itu - t g.9903/4  @xcite . however , due to the severe plc noise , narrowband ofdm plc is still limited to very low rates .",
    "clearly , the implementation of smart grids poses significant data transfer requirements . therefore , the design of algorithms for handling the severe noise conditions in narrowband plc is essential for the widespread implementation and realization of smart grids .      in the present paper",
    "we propose a receiver algorithm , based on the time - averaged mean squared error ( ta - mse ) criterion , for recovery of ofdm signals received over the narrowband plc channel .",
    "the receiver uses a cyclic version of the wiener filter , called frequency shift ( fresh ) filter , for exploiting the cyclostationary properties of the received signal .",
    "specifically , we present the _ first _ receiver designed for plc which takes advantage of the cyclostationary properties of _ both _ the _ noise _ , as well as the _ information signal_. the novel idea is to utilize the cyclostationary properties of the noise to achieve noise reduction .",
    "this is generally _ not possible _ when the noise is _ not cyclostationary _",
    "( e.g. , for awgn ) . the processing is specifically designed for low snrs which characterize narrowband plc . by exploiting the cyclostationary properties of both the ofdm signal and the noise , we achieve a substantial snr gain compared to the receiver proposed in  @xcite , which used only the cyclostationarity of the ofdm signal .",
    "this is achieved without changing anything at the transmitter , thereby maintaining the spectral efficiency of the ofdm signal .",
    "the method proposed for cyclostationary noise reduction can be applied in both coded and uncoded narrowband plc systems .",
    "we also show that the method is beneficial irrespective of the particular model of the cyclostationary noise , as long as cyclostationarity is maintained .",
    "it is well known that wiener filtering suffers from scaling of the signal at the output of the filter  ( * ? ? ?",
    "12.7 ) which degrades the ber performance . in this work",
    "we derive analytically the scaling factor , which helps in estimating the actual snr gain .",
    "we also discuss the application of the proposed receiver to channels with inter - symbol interference ( isi ) . finally , we consider an adaptive implementation of the proposed algorithm and analyze the relationship between ber and ta - mse .",
    "this indicates to the strength of the error correcting codes needed to obtain improved performance at different snrs .",
    "our results show the benefits of noise cancellation based on the noise properties , which should be considered in the design of future receivers for plc .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : preliminaries ] we briefly recall the relevant aspects of cyclostationarity to be used in this work .",
    "the cyclostationary properties of both the narrowband plc noise and the ofdm signal are presented and the frequency shift filter is reviewed . in section [ sec : model ] , the novel receiver algorithm is developed and its theoretical performance characteristics are obtained ; and in section [ sec : adaptive ] an adaptive implementation of the new receiver is discussed .",
    "we note that the design steps and algorithms used in the present work hold for both models  @xcite and  @xcite and the adaptive filter we propose works optimally for both models . in section [ sec : simulations ] simulation results are presented together with a discussion .",
