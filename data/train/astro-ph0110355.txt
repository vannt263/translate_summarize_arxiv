    "it was once thought that forming galaxies could be strong emission - line sources because a large number of massive stars cause the ionization of gas clouds in the forming galaxies ( partridge & peebles 1967 ) .",
    "motivated by this idea , many attempts have been made to search for such very strong emission - line sources at high redshift , but most these searches failed ( pritchet 1994 ; pahre & djorgovski 1995 ; thompson , mannucci , & beckwith 1996 ) .",
    "however , for these past several years , ly@xmath0 emitters have been found around known high-@xmath2 objects such as quasars ( hu & mcmahon 1996 ; hu , mcmahon , & egami 1996 ; petitjean et al . 1996 ; hu , mcmahon , & cowie 1999 ) .",
    "further , a number of high-@xmath2 ly@xmath0 emitters have also been found in several blank sky areas ( pascarelle et al .",
    "1996 ; cowie & hu 1998 ; keel et al . 1999 ; steidel et al .",
    "these recent surveys have reinforced the potential importance of search for high-@xmath2 ly@xmath0 emitters .",
    "it is remarkable that two ly@xmath0 emitters found in steidel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) are observed to be very extended spatially , e.g. , @xmath3 100 kpc ; we call these ly@xmath0 blobs lab1 and lab2 .",
    "these two labs are found at redshift @xmath4 and show no evidence for the association with agns blobs have been also found by pascarelle et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and keel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . however , since the three labs found in k99 ( 53w 002 , p96a object 18 , and p96a object 19 ) are all strong c iv emitters ( pascarelle et al .",
    "1996 ) , it seems natural to conclude that they are photoionized by the central engine of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "indeed , some powerful radio galaxies at high redshift have giant ly@xmath0 nebulae ( chambers , miley , & van bruegel 1990 ; van ojik et al .",
    "1996 ) . we do not discuss these agn - related ly@xmath0 blobs in this letter . ] .",
    "their observational properties are summarized as below ( in this letter , we adopt an einstein - de sitter cosmology with a hubble constant @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) ; 1 ) the observed ly@xmath0 luminosities are @xmath7 ergs s@xmath6 , 2 ) they appear elongated morphologically , 3 ) their sizes amount to @xmath3 100 @xmath8 kpc , 4 ) the observed line widths amount to @xmath9 km s@xmath6 , and 5 ) they are not associated with strong radio - continuum sources such as powerful radio galaxies .    as for the origin of the labs ,",
    "two alternative ideas have been proposed .",
    "one is that these labs are superwinds driven by the initial starburst in galaxies because all the above properties as well as the observed frequency of labs can be explained in terms of the superwind model ( taniguchi & shioya 2000 ) .",
    "taniguchi & shioya ( 2000 ) also discussed the evolutionary link from dust - enshrouded ( or dusty ) submillimeter sources ( hereafter dsss ) to labs because the central starburst region in a forming elliptical galaxy could be enshrouded by a lot of gas with dust grains .",
    "their scenario is summarized as follows ; step i : the initial starburst occurs in the center of pregalactic gas cloud .",
    "step ii : this galaxy may be hidden by surrounding gas clouds for the first several times @xmath10 years ( i.e. , the dss phase ) .",
    "step iii : the superwind blows and thus the dss phase ceases .",
    "the superwind leads to the formation of extended emission - line regions around the galaxy ( i.e. , the lab phase ) .",
    "this lasts for a duration of @xmath11 years . and ,",
    "step iv : the galaxy evolves to an ordinary elliptical galaxy @xmath12 years after the formation .",
    "this superwind model predicts that the labs are bright at rest - frame far - infrared if they are high - redshift , luminous analogue of nearby superwind galaxies like arp 220 .",
    "the other idea is that labs are cooling radiation from proto - galaxies or dark matter halos ( haiman , spaans , & quataert 2000 ; fardal et al .",
    "2001 ; fabian et al . 1986 ; hu 1992 ) .",
    "standard cold dark matter models predict that a large number of dark matter halos collapse at high redshift and they can emit significant ly@xmath0 fluxes through collisional excitation of hydrogen .",
    "these ly@xmath0 emitting halos are also consistent with the observed linear sizes , velocity widths , and ly@xmath0 fluxes of the labs .",
    "however , it is uncertain how much far infrared and submillimeter continuum emission can be emitted because little is known about the dust content and its spatial distribution in such dark matter halos .",
    "very recently lab1 has been detected at submillimeter wavelengths ( 450 and 850 @xmath1 m : chapman et al .",
    "2001 ) ; @xmath13(850 @xmath1 m ) = 20.1 @xmath14 3.3 mjy and @xmath13(450 @xmath1 m ) = 76 @xmath14 24 mjy . at the position of lab1 , one lyman break galaxy denoted as c11",
    "is found in the @xmath15 band image .",
    "a near - infrared ( nir ) source is also found close to the center of lab1 in the @xmath16 band image ( steidel et al .",
    "2000 ) ( hereafter the source k ) .",
    "if we adopt the superwind model of taniguchi & shioya ( 2000 ) , the source k is the most probable host galaxy giving rise to lab1 as the relic of its superwind .",
    "in figure 1 , we show the observed sed of lab1 . in this figure , we show the optical and nir photometric data for both the source k and c11 are shown .",
    "the submillimeter source detected at lab1 appears indeed coincident with the central ly@xmath0 knot of lab1 and this ly@xmath0 peak has the @xmath16-band counterpart , the source k ( chapman et al .",
    "therefore , the source k is the most likely host galaxy of the submillimeter sources rather than c11 .    for comparison ,",
    "we show seds of arp 220 , ngc 6240 , and smm 02399@xmath170136 , all of which are corrected as observed at @xmath2 = 3.1 .",
    "arp 220 is one of typical superwind galaxies in the local universe ( heckman , armus , & miley 1987 , 1990 ) and its infrared luminosity ( @xmath18 ) exceeds @xmath19 ; i.e. , a ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulig : sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ) ; @xmath20(arp 220 ) = @xmath21 with a friedman universe with a hubble constant of @xmath22 = 75 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "ngc 6240 is a luminous infrared galaxy in the local universe with evidence for an agn ( iwasawa 1999 ) .",
    "smm 02399@xmath170136 is a hyperluminous infrared galaxy with evidence for an agn at @xmath23 ( ivison et al .",
    "the observed sed of lab1 is quite similar to that of arp 220 although lab1 is more luminous by a factor of 30 than arp 220 = 70 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , lab1 is more luminous by a factor of 20 than arp 220 . ] .",
    "the seds of both ngc 6240 and smm 02399@xmath170136 appear different from that of lab1 in that they are brighter than lab1 at rest - frame uv and optical ranges .",
    "the observed @xmath13(450 @xmath1m)/@xmath13(850 @xmath1 m ) ratio ( 3.8 @xmath14 1.2 ) implies that the dust temperature is @xmath26 40 k if the source is located at @xmath27 ( chapman et al .",
    "2001 ; blain 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , scoville et al .",
    "( 1991 ) estimated @xmath26 47 k for arp 220 , being consistent with the above prediction .",
    "the comparison of seds shown in figure 1 suggests strongly that lab1 is a very bright infrared galaxy . since",
    "its infrared luminosity is higher by a factor of 30 than that of arp 220 , we obtain @xmath20(lab1 ) @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , lab1 can be regarded as a hyperluminous infrared galaxy or a hyperwind galaxy at @xmath29 .",
    "here we consider why lab1 is so luminous at submillimeter wavelengths when compared to arp 220 .",
    "although arp 220 shows evidence for the superwind activity , it is considered that ultraluminous starbursts have been going on for @xmath30 yr ( e.g. , taniguchi , trentham , & shioya 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath3 50% of the bolometric luminosity is hidden by a large amount of dust grains ( shioya , trentham , & taniguchi 2001 ) .",
    "this implies that the majority of the central energy sources are still covered by a cocoon of dust grains and thus arp 220 is a ulig with evidence for the superwind activity .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that intense star formation is still in progress in the heart of lab1 , although massive stars formed in earlier evolutionary phases have already exploded as type ii supernovae , giving rise to the formation of the observed extended ly@xmath0 nebula of lab1 .",
    "if the origin of lab1 is attributed to the cooling radiation from proto - galaxies or dark matter halos , dust grains would be associated with distributed star formation and thus the sed of lab1 can not be similar to that of arp 220 .",
    "it is known that arp 220 has a lot of molecular gas of @xmath31 ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; scoville et al . 1991",
    "; scoville , yun , & bryant 1997 ) .",
    "since lab1 appears to be a scaled - up version of arp 220 , it is expected that the gas mass of lab1 may exceed @xmath32 , being higher than that of a quasar host of br 1202@xmath170725 at @xmath33 ( ohta et al .",
    "1996 ; omont et al .",
    "the submillimeter detection of lab1 implies that a large amount of dust grains are already present in this source and thus significant flux from co molecules will be detected in the existing millimetric radio telescope facilities .",
    "the superwind model for lab1 suggests that lab1 is a weak x - ray emitter .",
    "scaling the x - ray data of arp 220 ( iwasawa 1999 ) , we estimate a rest - frame 2 - 10 kev flux of lab1 ( 0.49 - 2.44 kev in the observed frame ) as @xmath34 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath35 for a friedman cosmology with @xmath22 = 75 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 or @xmath36 ergs s@xmath6 @xmath35 for a cosmology with @xmath22 = 70 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "if this is the case , lab1 will not be detected in the x - ray even using _ chandra _",

    "1998 ; barger et al . 1998 ; eales et al . 1999 ) , it is known that submillimeter sources at high redshift are heterogeneous ( ivison et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , if we miss a number of hyperwind galaxies such as lab1 in the previous surveys , we could underestimate the star - formation rate at high redshift . in order to elucidate the cosmic star - formation history unambiguously ( hughes et al .",
