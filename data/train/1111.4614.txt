    "the charge current operator is proportional to the spin operator .",
    "the optical conductivity for the surface states , which is defined in terms of the current - current correlation function , is correspondingly directly related to the dynamical spin susceptibility.@xcite but for a topological insulator ribbon , in which two pairs of lateral surfaces are present , the relationship between the optical conductivity and the dynamical spin susceptibility would in general be more complicated .",
    "however , the results always depend uniquely on the characters of the model used , which also determine the properties of the surface states .",
    "the study of these responses may thus give some criteria to discriminate among available models for the topological insulator bi@xmath0se@xmath1 .",
    "in a previous work , two different models used in former works for bi@xmath0se@xmath1 were pointed out.@xcite here , we propose that the more adequate model for the material could be identified by measuring the dynamical spin susceptibility of a bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ribbon . while optical conductivities are identical , the dynamical spin susceptibilities show clear qualitative differences between results obtained from the two models .",
    "the results are explained in terms of selection rule analysis based on direct numerical calculations . for optical conductivity ,",
    "qualitatively different selection rules are in effect between transitions along the ribbon axis ( @xmath7 direction in this work ) and transitions along other directions .",
    "since we are interested mainly in the dynamical responses related to the topological surface states , it is reasonable to start from the continuum model for a topological insulator describing low energy states close to the @xmath8 point of the brillouin zone ( bz).@xcite    formerly , we recognized two different kinds of models that exist in the literature for bulk bi@xmath0x@xmath1 ( x is se or te ) materials.@xcite close to the @xmath8 point , the two models could both be written compactly in terms of the dirac matrices as@xcite @xmath9 every unit cell contains two spin and two orbital degrees of freedom . the model is hence written in terms of 4 by 4 matrices .",
    "the two orbitals concentrate mainly on the top and bottom ( looking along the @xmath10 direction ) se layer of the various bi@xmath0se@xmath1 quintuple units , and are labeled as 1 and 2.@xcite the basis is taken as @xmath11=[@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15@xmath16 , for a certain wave vector in the three dimensional bz . since the first term proportional to the unit matrix is nonessential to topological properties of the system , it is ignored in the following analysis .",
    "the remaining model is particle hole symmetric .",
    "close to the @xmath8 point , the four remaining coefficient functions are @xmath17=@xmath18 , in which @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 is half of the bulk band gap).@xcite in terms of pauli matrices @xmath23",

    "the surface states are described by different effective models .",
    "take for example the surface states for a sample occupying the lower half @xmath36 space , the effective model for it was solved to be@xcite @xmath37 for model i. the charge current matrix is thus @xmath38 . where the pauli matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 are in terms of the two basis @xmath41=@xmath42 and @xmath43=@xmath44 .",

    "differences between @xmath116 and optical conductivities along the other two directions arise from selection rules with respect to @xmath104 in the optical transitions .",
    "numerically , only transitions between pairs of sub - bands labeled by @xmath104 and @xmath122 are allowed for optical transitions along the @xmath7 direction .",
    "while for optical transitions along @xmath67 and @xmath36 , the transitions involving sub - band @xmath104 is largest with respect to @xmath123 .",
    "so , while for @xmath116 a series of peaks below 2@xmath22 are expected corresponding to transitions between @xmath104 and @xmath122 sub - bands , @xmath120 and @xmath121 only have low frequency peaks corresponding to transitions between adjacent sub - bands . for nonzero @xmath114 , the low frequency ( @xmath124 ) optical transitions contributing to @xmath116",
    "are strictly forbidden since the involved sub - band pairs are all occupied .",
    "thus the corresponding low frequency part of @xmath116 is depleted .",
    "but for @xmath120 and @xmath121 , the number of states that could contribute to low frequency optical absorptions continuously increases , resulting in a monotonic enhancement of the low frequency ( @xmath124 ) peaks with increasing @xmath115 .",
    "this nicely explains the evolution of the low frequency optical conductivities in fig .",
    "3 .    we now proceed to calculate the dynamical spin susceptibilities . in accordance with the optical conductivity , we focus on the imaginary part of the dynamical spin susceptibilities . only the longitudinal components would be analyzed here . for an ideal @xmath55 surface ,",
    "the optical conductivity is identical to the dynamical spin susceptibility . in the presence of @xmath107 surface , another correspondence between optical conductivity and spin susceptibility specific to the @xmath107 surface states mixes in . in fig .",
    "4 we show the imaginary parts of the longitudinal dynamical spin susceptibilities normalized by the frequency . in agreement with expectation based on the different spin distributions of the surface sub - bands ,",

    "@xmath87=0.01.,width=340,height=302 ]    though the two types of surfaces are coupled together , some qualitative correspondences between the optical conductivity and the dynamical spin susceptibility could still be identified.@xcite in particular , for an infinite @xmath55 surface , the @xmath7 component of the optical conductivity is proportional to the @xmath7 component of the dynamical spin susceptibility for model i while it is proportional to the @xmath67 component of the dynamical spin susceptibility for model ii .",
    "qualitatively similar correspondence could be identified from comparing fig .",
    "4 with fig .",
    "the @xmath67 and @xmath36 components of the optical conductivity suffer stronger influences from the lateral constriction and the induced surface states hybridization , the correspondences to the dynamical spin susceptibilities are also not very straightforward . note that , despite the similarity with the @xmath7 component of the optical conductivity , a subtle difference is that the first peak of the dynamical spin susceptibility occurs at a frequency which is twice that of the first peak in @xmath125 .",
    "this reflects a general difference between selection rules for electronic dipolar transitions ( contributing to @xmath126 ) and magnetic dipolar transitions ( contributing to @xmath127 ) , which coincides only very rarely for a state such as the surface state on the @xmath55 surface .",
    "explicitly , the matrix elements for the spin operators are nonzero only for transitions connecting second neighbor sub - bands , that is between @xmath104 with @xmath128 , profoundly different from the above - mentioned selection rules for the optical conductivity .",
    "we would like to point out an intricate point on identifying the right microscopic model for bi@xmath2se@xmath3 .",
    "experimentally , the spin polarization of the @xmath55 surface states was found to be perpendicular to the 2d wave vector.@xcite though model ii gives naturally the right spin polarization , it could not directly be chosen as the right model . changing the spin - orbital coupling in the @xmath55 plane from @xmath6 to @xmath5 in the bulk model , the same spin polarization as observed in experiment",
    "is realized also for model i.@xcite since this substitution amounts to a simple redefinition of the spin axes in the @xmath55 plane , @xmath129 and @xmath130 simply exchange with each other and thus similar distinction between the two models by the dynamical spin susceptibilities is still feasible .",
    "finally , we mention the experimental measurements of the dynamical spin susceptibilities",
    ". the electron magnetic resonance ( emr ) could approach @xmath1313 thz which amounts to approximately 12 mev.@xcite for a ribbon with much larger cross - section than considered above but similar to experiment,@xcite the sub - bands inside of the bulk band gap would be much denser than for @xmath132 .",
    "the corresponding low frequency peaks in the dynamical spin susceptibility would also within the reach of emr.@xcite another technique is the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) .",
    "though it is usually hard to see surface effects in terms of ins , when the chemical potential is tuned close to the dirac point inside of the bulk band gap , the surface would possibly give the dominant signal .",
    "at last , the spin flip surface raman scattering could be another possible way to measure the dynamical spin susceptibility.@xcite",
    "we have calculated the charge and spin distributions and the corresponding dynamical spin and charge responses of a topological insulator ribbon .",
    "two models giving different surface states are analyzed as a comparison .",
    "constriction along two lateral directions change the gapless dirac cone like surface states into sub - bands inside of the bulk band gap .",
    "the corresponding charge distributions of the sub - band states resulting from hybridization of four different surface states are identical for the two models , giving rise to identical optical conductivities for the two different models .",
    "the spin distributions of the surface states are however quite different between the two models .",
