    "in particular , we should see less dispersion in @xmath3 at @xmath211 , in the context of a scenario where x - rays at these lower eddington ratios originate from inverse compton scattering of disk uv photons off a hot corona that is energetically coupled to a thin disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . for @xmath211 ,",
    "the higher uv flux from the thin disk would increase the number of inverse compton scatterings , thereby cooling the corona and also producing mildly steeper x - ray spectra on average ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a systematic change in the x - ray properties , as described above , is not observed among the mbh  sample . however , when comparing @xmath116 estimates from different methods in table  [ tab : lledd ] , we can not exclude the possibility that the eddington ratios adopted for both the low- and high-@xmath4  mbh  samples are systematically underestimated , by perhaps up to an order of magnitude . if so , then nearly all of the high-@xmath4  sample would be in the super - eddington regime , and several of the lower-@xmath4 objects would fall close to the proposed `` slim disk '' transition .",
    "furthermore , we could also be systematically underestimating @xmath4 for our _ chandra _ targets if their virial - based @xmath158 estimates happen to be too large .",
    "thus , we can not exclude the possibility that the entire mbh  agn sample could feasibly be more rapidly accreting than they appear to be in figure  [ fig : aox ] , in which case wlqs may provide useful insight into understanding accretion onto the mbh  sample considered here .",
    "we note that limited information on eddington ratios for wlqs seems to point toward @xmath212 ; @xcite ) .",
    "our x - ray stacking analysis of the x - ray non - detected mbhs yields a relatively hard x - ray spectrum ( @xmath213 ) .",
    "for the objects with small @xmath3 , the inner edge of the slim disk modifies the `` intrinsic '' x - rays associated with the agn corona , and any observed x - rays are likely dominated by reflection / scattering , such that a hard x - ray spectrum is expected . among wlqs",
    ", an x - ray stacking analysis of the subpopulation of x - ray weak objects reveals a hard x - ray spectrum as well ( @xmath214 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also see @xcite ) .",
    "the similarly hard ( average ) spectra of the subsets of x - ray weak mbh  agn and x - ray weak wlqs may futher support a wlq analogy . of course , the error bars on @xmath81 for our stacked mbhs are large ( see table  [ tab : xstack ] ) .",
    "still , we find this to be an intriguing result , motivating a need for tighter x - ray spectral constraints for a sample of mbh  agn spanning both high- and low- @xmath3 , in order to rigorously compare @xmath81 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "if the wlq analogy holds , then we require samples of mbhs  that are accreting even more weakly than our low-@xmath4 sample , in order to search for a slim - to - thin disk transition by searching for systematic changes in the x - ray properties described earlier ( i.e. , less dispersion in @xmath3 and steeper @xmath81 at lower eddington ratios in the thin disk regime ) .",
    "the prototype mbh  ngc  4395 @xcite has a well - determined bolometric luminosity @xmath215 from a highly sampled broadband spectrum @xcite , providing @xmath216 for @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , ngc  4395 is not only accreting below the expected slim - to - thin disk transition at 0.10.3 @xmath4 , but it is also near / below another critical accretion regime at @xmath80.01@xmath218 where the disk is expected to switch from a thin disk to a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) , ) and low - accretion rate riafs ( @xmath219 ) are both radiatively inefficient , the physical reasons for their radiative inefficiencies are quite different .",
    "slim disks are radiatively inefficient largely because of photon trapping effects at near - eddington luminosities ; in most low - accretion rate riaf models , the low radiative efficiency is mainly due to weak coulomb coupling in the accretion flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for other variants of riafs at low - accretion rates , also see , e.g .. @xcite . ] as described below .    for agn fed by a thin disk , the x - ray photon index @xmath81 is correlated with eddington ratio when @xmath220 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "below @xmath80.01 @xmath218 , @xmath81 and @xmath4 are anti - correlated , so that agn show the hardest x - ray spectra around @xmath221 , which may indicate a transition from a thin disk to a riaf around 1% @xmath218 ( e.g. , @xcite ; note that @xmath81 eventually plateaus to @xmath222 at the lowest eddington ratios , e.g. , @xcite ) . this x - ray spectral behavior is observed for stellar mass black holes in x - ray binary systems as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that it is a universal feature of black hole accretion , regardless of black hole mass .",
    "ngc  4395 supports this trend for mbhs , as it displays a hard photon index @xmath223 at @xmath224 @xcite .",
    "we have no reason to suspect that the bolometric luminosity of ngc  4395 could be biased in the same manner as for the other mbhs ( since its @xmath174 is calculated from an observed broadband spectrum of the nucleus ) .",
    "the physical mechanism for the small @xmath81 for ngc  4395 is therefore different than the small @xmath81 discussed earlier in the context of a slim disk .",
    "this intriguing trend is of course far from robust being based on a single source , and it further motivates a need for high signal - to - noise x - ray spectra for mbhs across a wide range of @xmath4 .",
    "a sizeable population of lower-@xmath4 mbh  agn is unlikely accessible from optical - selection techniques , however , and recovering such objects will require complementary multiwavelength searches . high - spatial resolution x - ray surveys ( especially when combined with the radio ) are a promising avenue for revealing weakly accreting black holes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also note galaxies 53  and 56  in the current work that show x - ray signatures of an agn , but lack optical photoionization signatures of activity . ) .",
    "success has also been achieved through infrared surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as fast variability @xcite .",
    "we stress that it is unclear if the optically - based @xmath4 measurements are indeed systematically underestimated , and the above wlq analogy is only meant to represent one possibility .",
    "if the adopted @xmath4 estimates are accurate , then there does not appear to be a distinct eddington ratio that marks a transition in radiative efficiency .",
    "in that case , a range of accretion disk / corona properties may contribute to the dispersion in @xmath3 , which may include a substantial number of intrinsically x - ray weak agn . to confirm or refute current @xmath4 estimates , broadband spectral energy distributions for a substantially larger number of mbhs",
    "are required to properly constrain the bolometric corrections for this population .",
    "such a project will require high - resolution imaging across the entire electromagnetic spectrum to separate the agn from the host galaxy ( see for further discussion , as well as , e.g. , @xcite , for examples of well - sampled broadband spectra ) .",
    "we find no evidence for a difference in the x - ray properties of mbhs from @xmath225 .",
    "we argue that either ( 1 ) optically - based @xmath4 estimates are systematically underestimated and nearly all mbhs accrete from a geometrically thick , radiatively inefficient slim disk ; or ( 2 ) there is variety in the accretion details among individual objects , but there is no evidence for a systematic change in accretion properties at a specific eddington ratio .",
    "if mbhs indeed accrete from a slim disk , then super - eddington accretion could provide a mechanism for growing smbhs in the early universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , @xcite recently showed that a faint high - redshift agn population could produce enough flux to account for the epoch of reionization , provided that agn x - ray - to - uv luminosity ratios in the early universe are not too hard ( @xcite explicitly adopt @xmath226 ) . from an empirical perspective",
    "( and regardless of the accretion mode ) , the observed flattening of the @xmath227 relation at low luminosities implies that accretion onto mbhs produces a broadband continuum in line with requirements for agn driven reioniziation .",
