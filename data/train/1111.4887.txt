[ fig_best_worst]a ) and the case in which also the three nearest neighbors are between substrate atoms ( low probability , fig .  [ fig_best_worst]b ) .",

    "the hydrogenation model described above produces clusters inside which only one graphene sublattice is hydrogenated .",
    "this leads to the formation of midgap states in the electronic structure , associated with dangling bonds .",
    "however , these states are believed to be an artefact of the tb model , due to the fact that bond relaxation is neglected . to avoid this , after hydrogen atoms are generated according to the method described above , a final step is introduced : additional hydrogen atoms are placed on top of the carbon atoms that have at least two nearest neighbors being hydrogenated .",

    "nevertheless , we propose here an alternative method based on green s functions .",
    "although in the case considered here our method does not improve the computational time with respect to the diagonalization technique , because almost all the off - diagonal of the spectral function in real space need to be calculated , the method could be interesting in other situations , such as for the calculation of the local density of states in real space , where only few elements of the spectral function are needed .",
