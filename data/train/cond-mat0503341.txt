    "recent intensive investigations of electron transport through quantum dot ( qd ) systems have uncovered novel correlation effects in nanoscale systems .",
    "in particular , the observation @xcite of the kondo effect in qd systems @xcite opened a new path for the investigation of strongly correlated electrons , which has stimulated further experimental and theoretical studies in this field @xcite .",
    "more recently , a variety of qd systems , such as an aharonov - bohm ring with qd , double quantum dot ( dqd ) systems , etc , have been fabricated .",
    "an interesting new feature in these systems is the interference effects induced via multiple paths of electron propagation @xcite .",
    "for example , such interference effects have been clearly observed in the aharonov - bohm ring with qd @xcite .",
    "when electron correlations due to the kondo effect are affected by such interference , transport properties exhibit remarkable properties .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical works on dqd systems in this context .",
    "for example , it was pointed out that the dqd system shows the dramatic suppression of the kondo - assisted transport due to the interference when the dqd is arranged in the parallel geometry @xcite , whereas such interference effects do not appear in the serial dqd @xcite .",
    "more recently , slightly different dqd systems with the parallel geometry , where the two dots are connected via the exchange coupling @xcite or the tunneling @xcite , have been studied .",
    "it has been pointed out that the kondo - assisted transport in these cases exhibits different properties from the above simple dqd case without the inter - dot coupling .",
    "the t - shaped dqd @xcite is another prototype of such correlated systems , for which the special arrangement of the dqd provides an additional path of electron propagation , giving rise to the interference effects .",
    "this system also shows somewhat different transport properties from the parallel dqd case , but the detailed analysis has not been done systematically . in any case , the interplay of the kondo effect and the interference provides intriguing phenomena due to electron correlations in the dqd systems .",
    "it is thus interesting to systematically study how the interference together with the kondo effect affects characteristic transport properties in a variety of dqd systems .    motivated by the above hot topics , we investigate kondo - assisted transport properties in dqd systems , when the geometry of the system is systematically changed among the serial , parallel and t - shaped dqd .",
    "we pay our particular attention to the kondo effect under the influence of the interference due to different paths .",
    "we also discuss the dqd systems with ferromagnetic ( fm ) leads .",
    "this is stimulated by the recent extensive study of spin - dependent transport through a qd coupled to fm leads in the context of spintronics @xcite . since the kondo effect is sensitive to the internal spin degrees of freedom , notable phenomena caused by the fm leads",
    "are expected to appear in transport properties .",

    "this tendency results from the fact that the bonding state is almost decoupled from the leads while the anti - bonding state is still tightly connected to the leads as @xmath74 . as a result ,",

    "this change in the dos can be interpreted as follows .",
    "when @xmath98 ( close to the parallel geometry ) the two resonances are composed of the bonding and anti - bonding kondo states . on the other hand , for @xmath99 ( t - shaped geometry ) , they are composed of the kondo states at the dot-1 and the dot-2 , where the former ( latter ) has a broad ( sharp ) resonance @xcite . as @xmath96 decreases , the double - peak structure of the kondo resonances gradually changes its properties between the two limits mentioned above .",
    "it should be noticed that in the t - shaped case , the dos of the dot-1 itself develops a dip structure by interference effects with the dot-2 @xcite , in contrast to the case of the parallel geometry .",

    "it has been shown that the gate - voltage control causes two main effects via the change of the dot - levels : the increase of the dot - level induces charge fluctuations and also causes the renormalization of the effective inter - dot coupling .",

    "in particular , it has been demonstrated in the t - shaped case that the gate - voltage ( i.e. dot - level ) control leads to a tendency contrary to the single - dot case : the conductance increases with the increase of the bare level of the dot , reflecting the kondo effect influenced by the interference effect .",
    "we have also discussed the impact of the fm leads on transport properties .",

    "<S> we systematically investigate electron transport through double quantum dots with particular emphasis on interference induced via multiple paths of electron propagation . by means of the slave - boson mean - field approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the conductance , the local density of states , the transmission probability in the kondo regime at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> it is clarified how the kondo - assisted transport changes its properties when the system is continuously changed among the serial , parallel and t - shaped double dots . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results for the conductance are explained in terms of the kondo resonances influenced by interference effects . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the impacts due to the spin - polarization of ferromagnetic leads . </S>"
