    "very little is known about the mass function of nuclear black holes ( bhs ) with mass below @xmath10 @xmath11 . until recently there were only two secure candidates of intermediate - mass bhs in galactic nuclei : ngc 4395 ( filippenko & ho 2003 ) and pox 52 ( barth et al.2004 ) . the tight correlation between host bulge velocity dispersion and bh mass ( the @xmath12  relation ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) suggests that bhs play an essential role in the evolution of galaxies , and yet we know next to nothing empirical about the starting conditions , or seeds , of supermassive bhs .",
    "an understanding of the low - mass end of the bh mass function may provide one of the few observational constraints on seed bhs , at least prior to the _ laser interferometry space antenna _ ( _ lisa _ ; hughes 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , it remains unclear whether small galaxies , without classical bulges , may host central bhs , and whether they obey the same @xmath12  relation .",
    "for these reasons , greene & ho ( 2004 ) performed a systematic search for such a population of intermediate - mass bhs .",
    "they used the first data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss;york et al .",
    "2000 ; abazajian et al .  2003 ) to select a sample of broad - line active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with virial mass estimates  emission line ( see , e.g. ,   greene & ho 2005 ) .",

    "this sample of 19 galaxies represents the only uniformly selected sample of intermediate - mass bhs in active galaxies . remarkably , these objects appear to obey the same @xmath12  relation as that established for high - mass systems ( barth et al . 2005 ) , suggesting that a single physical mechanism operates over nearly 5 orders of magnitude to maintain the observed relation .",
    "this sample provides the opportunity to examine the broad spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of bhs in a new mass regime . as discussed by greene & ho ( 2004 ) , the eddington ratios [ @xmath8 , where @xmath18  ( @xmath15/@xmath11 ) ergs s@xmath1 ] of the sample are all close to unity .",
    "to begin to characterize the seds of this unique sample , we obtained high - resolution 6  cm continuum observations using the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "our sample probes a poorly explored region of parameter space , in terms of bh mass and eddington ratio , and so may provide new insights into the physical drivers of radio properties in agns .",
    "throughout we assume the following cosmological parameters to calculate distances : @xmath20  km  s@xmath1  mpc@xmath1 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( spergel et al .",
    "all observations were taken over 22.5 hours on 9 october 2004 , when the vla was in a configuration ( thompson et al .",
    "1980 ) . during the observations",
    "only two antennas were excluded from the array , and the weather conditions were good .",
    "we observed at 4.860 ghz ( 6  cm ; c band ) with a bandwidth of -6 mm 50 mhz for each of two intermediate frequencies separated by 50 mhz .",
    "integration times ranged from 10 minutes to 2 hours , depending on the [ ]  @xmath23 line luminosity of the sources given in greene & ho ( 2004 ) .",
    "using the relation between @xmath24}}$ ]  and radio power for radio - quiet agns from ho & peng ( 2001 ; shown in fig .",
    "1 ) , we predicted a radio power for each source , and thus the integration time required to reach a @xmath25 detection threshold ( see table 1 ) , although we observed no source for less than 10 minutes or longer than 2 hours . for purposes of phase calibration , observations of the target",
    "were alternated every 35 minutes with observations of a nearby ( usually within @xmath26 degrees ) , bright radio source .",
    "our flux scale is tied to 3c 48 , with an assumed flux density of 5.4 jy .",
    "flux - scale uncertainties are dominated by uncertainties in the absolute flux of the phase calibrators computed based on 3c 48 and are conservatively estimated to be @xmath27 .",
    "initial flux and phase calibration was performed within aips ( greisen 2003 ) on the observed visibilities , after removal of corrupted records .",
    "the visibilities were then fourier transformed to create an image of intensity on the sky .",
    "confusing sidelobes were removed using the deconvolution algorithm clean ( hgbom 1974 ) as modified by clark ( 1980 ) .",
    "since this is a detection experiment , we use `` natural '' weighting to maximize our sensitivity .",
    "the resulting maps have a pixel scale of @xmath28 and a typical synthesized beam of @xmath29 . the half power beam width ( primary beam ) of the individual antennas",
    "is @xmath30 , so we constructed images of this size to search for confusing sources in the field , which we found in only two cases ( gh07 and gh14 ) .",
    "the theoretical noise ranges from 0.02 to 0.06 mjy beam@xmath1 . since clean can change the noise statistics in a source - free image , aside from the three objects with flux in the maps ( gh07 , gh10 , and gh14 ) , we performed subsequent analysis directly on the `` dirty '' maps . in all cases we were able    -8 mm + 3 mm to achieve the theoretical noise limit",
    "( see table 1 ) .",
    "in the three cases where clean was required , we iterated until the `` clean components '' reached a limiting flux of @xmath31  rms , where rms is the theoretical noise limit , and in the case of gh07 and gh14 , clean boxes were placed around the distant confusing sources",
    ". finally , to investigate the possible presence of more extended emission , we also constructed images with a gaussian tapering function that fell to 30% power at 200 k@xmath32 , which resulted in a typical synthesized beam of @xmath33 .",
    "we note that our minimum spacing is @xmath34  k@xmath32 , corresponding to a maximum angular scale of @xmath35 .",

    "three samples were included , to span the maximum range in optical nuclear luminosity ( @xmath38 mag ) .",
    "the highest - luminosity sources are the 87 palomar - green ( pg ) quasars with @xmath39 ( schmidt & green 1983 ) , while low - luminosity seyfert galaxies are drawn from the palomar spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies ( ho et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) , supplemented at intermediate luminosity by the sample of seyferts selected from the cfa redshift rurvey ( huchra & burg 1992 ) . the radio observations for the cfa seyferts are presented in kukula et al.(1995 ) , those for the palomar seyferts are from ho & ulvestad ( 2001 ) and ulvestad & ho ( 2001a ) , and the pg quasars were observed by kellermann et al .",

    "they are more consistent with the distribution of radio powers of the seyfert nuclei ( @xmath44 to @xmath45 w  hz@xmath1 ) .",
    "radio powers alone , however , are somewhat misleading , since bhs of different mass have different ( limiting ) eddington luminosities .",

    "the radio - loud fraction is @xmath48 for the pg sample and @xmath49 for the lbqs sample .",
    "in contrast , @xmath50 of the ho & peng seyfert sample are radio - loud , once the nuclear emission is properly isolated .",
    "now we investigate possible reasons that the ho & peng @xmath24}}$]-@xmath37  relation might overpredict the radio power of our sources .",
    "the relation was fit to the radio - quiet points only , and since our entire sample is radio - quiet ( gh10 has _",
    "r _  = 2.8 , while the mean _ r _  for the rest is @xmath6 2.3 ) , the discrepancy can not be explained by our choice of the optical - radio relation .",
    "however , very few of the radio - quiet objects from ho & peng have [ ]  luminosities less than @xmath51 ergs  s@xmath1 , while the majority of our objects do .",

    "actual detections of a sample such as that presented here are required to distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "gh10 is the only object in the sample detected by the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm survey ( first ; becker et al .",
    "1995 ) and is the only object detected here . because of the relatively large beam ( @xmath52 5 ) of first and the low radio power of gh10 ( @xmath53 w  hz@xmath1 )",
    ", greene & ho ( 2004 ) argue that the 20  cm emission from gh10 may originate from the host galaxy rather than the agn .",
    "given the much superior angular resolution of our current image ( @xmath54 ) , most of the radio emission probably originates from the agn itself ( see fig .",
    "using the task jmfit within aips , we find that the image is marginally resolved , with a deconvolved size of @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , a position angle of @xmath57 , and a total flux density of @xmath58 mjy .",
    "since the source is slightly resolved , there is most likely some host galaxy contribution , and so the peak flux density may give a better measure of the unresolved agn emission .",
    "the peak flux density of @xmath59 mjy corresponds to a radio power of @xmath60  w  hz@xmath1 . using the 4400   flux density from table 1",
    ", we find an @xmath61 value of 2.8 for this source .",
    "since the source was also detected with first , we can estimate a crude spectral index @xmath62 , where @xmath63 .",
    "this calculation is problematic because the observations were nonsimultaneous and made with very different resolutions . in order to minimize the uncertainties resulting from differing + 1 mm resolutions , we use the first peak flux density , 1.2 mjy beam@xmath1 , to find @xmath62 = 0.62 .",
    "we emphasize that this is a very uncertain value .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we omit gh10 from the following discussion .",
    "given that all but one of the objects in our sample were nondetections , we have devoted some care to deriving the most stringent possible upper limits on the radio emission from these sources .",
    "we derive rms values from our final images within a box enclosing the inner quarter of the image , and our nominal upper limits are simply 3 times this measured rms . at worst , the instrumental and atmospheric phase for each antenna on a given calibrator vary by no more than @xmath64 over a 5-minute period .",
    "there are no substantial phase changes even between calibrators in very different regions of the sky ; over the course of 18 hours of our 24-hour observation , the phase calibration remained stable within @xmath65 for each antenna .",
    "this implies a coherence loss of less than @xmath66 for our target objects , independent of the angular separation between calibrator and target , leading to the conclusion that our cited upper limits are accurate and quite robust .",
    "while we were unable to detect any of our objects individually , we can construct a single , deep image by coadding all the observations .",
    "this approach has been applied successfully with nondetections in first of sdss ( glikman et al .",
    "2004 ) and 2qz ( wals et al .",
    "2005 ) agns .",
    "stacking is performed in the image plane .",
    "since the first observations have uniform sensitivity , they can be summed directly . in our case , because exposure times varied between observations , we give additional weight to those with the highest sensitivity .",
    "we compute a weighted - average image using the task comb within aips , where the weights are simply @xmath67 and the images are aligned to their central pixel .",
    "we expect all the sources to lie within the central @xmath68 , since our positions depend on sdss astrometry , which has an accurary of @xmath69 ( stoughton et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the astrometric accuracy of the vla phase calibrators is also @xmath69 ( wilkinson et al .  1998 ; vla calibrator manual ) .",
    "the individual maps used in the stacking analysis were thus constructed with @xmath68 pixels .",
    "the effective rms of our stacked image is 0.0069 mjy beam@xmath1 , which is approximately one - third of our best rms for a single exposure .",
    "this is roughly as expected , since we have increased the on - source exposure time from a maximum of 2 hours to 16 hours .",
    "we take our upper limit as @xmath31rms and an average @xmath70 = 0.077 mjy ( from the values published in greene & ho 2004 ; see table 1 ) to find an effective limit on the @xmath61 parameter of 0.27 .",
    "we are therefore able to place a far more stringent upper limit for the sample ensemble than for any individual source .    for completeness",
    ", we also derived upper limits on extended emission from the host galaxies themselves , using lower - resolution , tapered images with a synthesized beam @xmath71 = 1 .",
    "our upper limits correspond to an average 6  cm radio power of @xmath72  w  hz@xmath1 , which is roughly similar to the 1.4 ghz power of normal ( inactive ) @xmath73 galaxies ( condon 1992 ) .",
    "given that the galaxies in this sample are relatively faint , @xmath33  mag fainter than @xmath73 ( greene & ho 2004 ) , this is not a very strong limit , but it does indicate that the hosts are not experiencing any vigorous starburst activity . assuming a radio spectral index of @xmath74 ,",
    "the inferred average 20  cm radio power of @xmath75  w  hz@xmath1 translates into an approximate star formation rate of @xmath76 @xmath77 ( yun et al . 2001 ) .      a natural comparison may be drawn between our sample and ngc 4395 , the prototypical agn with an intermediate - mass bh .",
    "ngc 4395 has been imaged in the radio with the vla ( moran et al .",
    "1999 ; ho & ulvestad 2001 ) and the very long baseline array ( vlba ; wrobel et al .",

    "the 20  cm vlba image has a diameter less than 11  mas and a total power of @xmath81  w  hz@xmath1 , implying that some of the flux has been resolved by the vlba .",

    "r _  @xmath82 2.0 .",
    "more generally , the objects presented here technically belong to the subclass of agns known as narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) .",
    "formally , these are broad - line agns with fwhm @xmath83  km  s@xmath1  for the h@xmath84  line . they also tend to have low [ ] /h@xmath84  ratios , high /h@xmath84  ratios , and prominent soft x - ray excesses ( e.g. ,  boller et al . 1996 ; but see williams et al .",

    "a possibly more pertinent comparison with our sample comes from the pg survey , since it has available sensitive , high - resolution radio observations ( kellermann et al .",

    "2003 ; fender & belloni 2004 ) . at higher x - ray luminosities ( 0.01 @xmath80.3 ) ,",
    "a conventional optically thick , geometrically thin disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) produces a spectrum dominated by thermal , soft x - ray emission ( the `` high / soft '' state ) , during which the radio emission is quenched ( tananbaum et al .  1972",
    "; fender et al.1999 , 2004 ; gallo et al .",
    "2003 ; tigelaar et al .",
    "finally , for systems with the highest luminosities ( @xmath80.3 ) , in which the accretion flow might take the form of a radiation pressure - dominated slim disk ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ) , the x - ray spectrum can be dominated by a very steep power - law component ( the `` very - high '' or `` spl '' state ) .",
    "the very - high state itself is radio - quiet , but transitions from the very - high to the high state may be accompanied by optically thin ejection events in the radio ( e.g. ,  corbel et al .  2001 ; hannikainen et al .",
    "2001 ; fender et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "since jet physics is basically scale - free ( heinz & sunyaev 2003 ) , a number of authors have drawn a direct analogy between the spectral states of xrbs and agns ( e.g. ,  meier 2001 ; maccarone et al .",
    "2003 ; merloni et al .",
    "2003 ; falcke et al .",
    "2004 ; jester 2005 ) .",
    "the most thorough comparison has been made for low - luminosity agns , whose characteristic radio - loudness , hard x - ray spectra , and radiative inefficiency bear close resemblance to the properties of xrbs in their low / hard state ( ho 2005 ) .",
    "the riaf at low accretion rates may be particularly conducive to jet production because its vertical thickness supports a strong poloidal magnetic field ( meier 2001 ) , in addition to providing a population of weakly bound or unbound particles that are unstable toward outflow ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) .    extending the comparison to the high and very - high states",
    ", however , presents a greater challenge .",
    "this is in part due to the somewhat nebulous luminosity criterion various authors use to differentiate the high state from the very - high state , and to the fact that the current estimates of bolometric luminosities and bh masses in agns are still rather uncertain .",
    "nls1s , with their characteristically soft x - ray spectra , are often thought to be the direct analog of xrbs in the high state ( pounds et al .",
    "1995 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "many nls1s ( e.g. , collin & kawaguchi 2004 ) , though certainly not all ( e.g. , ngc 4395 ) , evidently have eddington ratios  when taken at face value  that exceed 0.3 , the formal upper limit for the stability of a shakura & sunyaev disk .",
    "if we take this theoretically motivated criterion as a definition for the very - high state , then most well - studied nls1s , including the sample of greene & ho ( 2004 ) highlighted here , would technically qualify as being in the very - high state , rather than in the high state .",
    "regardless of which choice one adopts for nls1s , our study emphasizes a distinctive feature of nls1s as a class : they appear to be abnormally radio - quiet .",
    "if the currently estimated bolometric luminosities and bh masses are robust , the implication is that jet production in agns is suppressed when their eddington ratios approach or exceed 1 .",
    "this empirical result for nls1s is consistent with the tendency for radio emission to be quenched in xrbs in their high and very - high states .",
    "the quenching of radio emission in the high state may be related to the weakness of the poloidal component of the magnetic field , central to driving a jet , in a geometrically thin disk ( livio et al .",
    "1999 ; meier 2001 ) .",
    "as mentioned above , xrbs undergoing very - high state transitions often exhibit rapid radio flares , perhaps generated from the relativistic ejection of the corona as the optically thick accretion disk moves inward ( fender et al .",
    "since the general quasar population is thought to radiate at high @xmath8 , it has been suggested that the radio - loud quasar population consists of objects that have recently undergone a state transition involving a relativistic ejection event ( marscher et al.2002 ; gallo et al .",
    "2003 ; jester 2005 ) . in that case , it is puzzling that nls1s have such a low fraction ( 0%6% ) of radio - loud objects as compared to quasars ( 10%20% ) .",
    "bal quasars are similar in this respect ( e.g. ,  stocke et al .",
    "1992 ) . apparently at the highest accretion rates , even relativistic ejection events are uncommon .",
    "this result warrants further theoretical exploration .",
    "we present a high - resolution study of radio emission from a well - defined sample of low - mass active galaxies radiating at a high fraction of their eddington luminosity ( @xmath8 ) . only a single object ( gh10 ) in our sample of 19 is detected , with a radio power of 8.5 @xmath0 w  hz@xmath1 , while we place @xmath3 upper limits of @xmath102 to @xmath5 w  hz@xmath1  for the nondetections .",
    "all the objects have very low ratios of radio to optical flux ( _ r _ ) .",
    "gh10 has an _",
    "r _  of 2.8 , and a stacked image of the remaining observations provides an upper limit of _ r _  @xmath103 .",
    "while this study represents one of the few deep , high - resolution radio surveys of a uniform sample of narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) , a review of the literature reveals that nls1s are generically radio - quiet .",
    "in contrast , low-@xmath8  sources are ubiquitously radio - loud .",
    "therefore , our observations provide renewed support for an inverse relation between @xmath8  and radio - loudness . further support for this picture is provided by black holes in x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) , whose radio emission is quenched when they radiate at high ( @xmath104 ) fractions of their eddington luminosity .",
    "this same analogy has been used to suggest that radio - loud quasars may be undergoing a relativistic ejection event similar to those observed when xrbs transition from the very - high state . in that case , it is quite intriguing that objects at the highest accretion rates , namely nls1s and bal quasars , have abnormally low radio - loud fractions , a finding for which we currently have no clear explanation .",
