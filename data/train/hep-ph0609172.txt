    "the advent of collider energies to heavy  ion physics is leading to a profound change in the field .",
    "the new tools available , specially the access to the large transverse momentum part of the spectrum , allow for an unprecedented characterization of the high  density state created in such collisions .",
    "accordingly , the traditional goal of producing a _ quark - gluon plasma _ , the deconfined state of quarks and gluons predicted from qcd , has been enlarged to the study of several other mechanisms as thermalization , parton distribution functions at very small-@xmath0 or in  medium evolution of parton showers . in general words ,",
    "a new line is emerging which attempt to study how the collective properties of the fundamental interactions appear .",
    "for that end , large energy densities in _ extended _ regions need to be produced in contrast with the traditional direction in high  energy physics which attempt to create the largest possible energy scales in well localized spacial regions for new physics to become observable",
    ".    the relevant questions which can be addressed in experiments of heavy ion collisions can be ( artificially ) classified depending on the time scale of the relevant phenomena : i ) before the collision , the structure of the two lorenz - contracted nuclei is rather different from a typical hadron at the same energy and collective phenomena , nowadays generically known under the name of color glass condensate , appear ; ii ) once the high - density state is created , the relevant question is how thermalization and other collective mechanisms , as a possible hydrodynamical behavior , appear ; iii ) finally , the properties of the eventually equilibrated medium need to be studied by means of some indirect signals .",
    "the lhc is in an excellent position to address these questions @xcite .",
    "reaching collider energies provides the additional tool of the hard part of the spectrum , characterized by large virtualities , to be used for these studies .",
    "a typical hard cross section can be written in the form @xmath1 with a factorization between the short - distance perturbative cross section @xmath2 , computable in powers of @xmath3 and two long - distance terms , the proton / nuclear parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , @xmath4 , encoding the partonic structure of the colliding objects , and the fragmentation functions ( ff ) , @xmath5 , describing the hadronization of the parton @xmath6 into a final hadron @xmath7 .",
    "these long - distance terms are non - perturbative objects , but whose evolution can be computed in perturbative qcd .",
    "these are precisely the objects which will be modified in the case that the _ extension _ of the colliding system interferes with the dynamics , while the short - distance part is expected to remain unchanged if the virtuality is large enough .",
    "this interference between geometry and dynamics makes hard probes perfect tools to characterize the medium properties through the modification of the long - distance terms in ( [ eqhard ] ) .",
    "a conceptually simple example is the case of the @xmath8 whose production cross section is , schematically , @xmath9}(x_1,x_2,q^2 )   \\langle { \\cal o}([c\\bar c]\\to j/\\psi)\\rangle\\ , , \\ ] ] where now @xmath10\\to j/\\psi)\\rangle$ ] describes the hadronization of a @xmath11 pair in a given state ( for example a color octet ) into a final @xmath8 .",
    "this long - distance part is expected to be modified in a medium at finite temperature in which the deconfinement avoids the bound states to exist @xcite .",
    "however , this modification , being non - perturbative , lacks of good theoretical control and the real situation about the @xmath8-suppression is complicated @xcite .    from the computational point of view",
    ", a theoretically simpler case involves the modification of the _ evolution _ of both the parton distribution and the fragmentation functions in a dense or finite  temperature medium .",
    "this needs of large scales @xmath12 in order for the strong coupling to be small and perturbative methods to apply . in general , the presence of a dense medium is translated into non - linear terms in the evolution equations .",
    "the study of the modifications of the nuclear partonic distributions is nowadays known under the generic name of _ color glass condensate_. in its original formulation @xcite it provides a general framework for the whole collision , based on an effective theory separating the fast modes in the nuclear wave function from the _ generated _ slow modes , associated to small-@xmath0 gluons .",
    "this small-@xmath0 gluons have parametrically large ( @xmath13 ) densities and can be treated as classical fields .",
    "the quantum evolution equation of this setup is known and , remarkably , can be written in a rather simple form in the large-@xmath14 limit @xcite .",
    "a sophisticated technology has been developed in the last decade in this framework which , in addition to describe the structure of the incoming wave functions , aims to provide the link to the subsequent evolution into a thermal system @xcite . from a phenomenological point of view , the most successful applications of these formalism are the description of the multiplicities measured at rhic @xcite ; the possible presence of the predicted geometric scaling in lepton - hadron data @xcite ; and the suppression of inclusive particles at forward rapidities at rhic @xcite , which has been predicted as a result of small-@xmath0 quantum evolution @xcite . a particularly economic description is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . here",
    ", the saturation scale is obtained from lepton - proton and lepton - nucleus data as @xmath15 with fitted parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "[ fig1 ] left shows the quality of the geometric scaling in lepton - proton @xcite and lepton - nucleus @xcite data . assuming the same scaling to hold in aa collisions , the multiplicity in the central rapidity can be written as @xcite @xmath18 where only a total normalization factor @xmath19 is needed once the energy and centrality dependences are fixed by lepton - proton and lepton - nucleus data respectively .",

    "a perturbative modification of the fragmentation of the highly virtual produced partons , has been proposed as a tool to characterize the medium produced in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "these effects on high-@xmath20 particles , generically known as _ jet quenching _ , constitute one of the main experimental observations at rhic so far @xcite . in the near future",
    ", the lhc will extend the range in transverse momentum for at least one order of magnitude @xcite . in the vacuum ,",
    "a perturbatively produced high-@xmath20 parton with virtuality @xmath21 develops a parton shower by radiating other partons ( mainly gluons ) with decreasing virtuality .",
    "this shower stops when a typical hadronic scale @xmath22gev@xmath23 is reached .",
    "the resulting jet is an extended object in which the collinear and soft emitted gluons are emitted inside a cone around the original parton direction .",
    "when the high-@xmath20 particle is produced in the medium created after a heavy ion collision , this parton shower is modified .",
    "the jets , being extended structures , provide an excellent tool to characterize the medium properties at different scales .    at high enough parton energies , the main mechanism driving the modifications of high-@xmath20 evolution is the medium - induced gluon radiation . as in general high - energy processes , the propagation of the partons through the medium can be described in terms of wilson lines averaged in the allowed configuration of a medium .",
    "several prescriptions exist for these averages and in the multiple soft scattering limit , the saddle point approximation of the wilson lines define a single parameter of the medium , the transport coefficient , @xmath24 , given by the average transverse momentum squared acquired by the gluon per mean free path .",
    "the typical energy spectrum of radiated gluons is softer than in the vacuum although formation time effects provide a typical scale @xmath25 under which the radiation is suppressed . in the same way ,",
    "the angular distribution is regulated at angles smaller than @xmath26 . as a result of formation time effects ( or coherence effects )",
    "the medium - induced gluon radiation is , hence , finite in the infrared or collinear limits .",
    "the two main predictions are the suppression of high-@xmath20 yields due to additional in - medium energy loss and the associated broadening of the jet structures .",
    "although the degree of theoretical refinement of the jet quenching formalisms is still not completely satisfactory , it provides a good description of experimental data with the medium - modified fragmentation function computed as @xmath27 here , @xmath28 gives the probability of an additional in - medium energy loss and is normally computed by assuming a simple poisson distribution with the medium - induced gluon radiation as input @xcite .",
    "once the geometry of the system is correctly taken into account , a fit to rhic data ( see fig .",
    "[ figraa ] ) gives the value of the time - averaged transport coefficient @xmath29 gev@xmath30/fm .",
    "this large value and the corresponding uncertainty is a direct consequence of the surface trigger bias effect in inclusive particle suppression measurements @xcite .",
    "this is an intrinsic limitation of inclusive measurements on the characterization of the medium and on the study of the dynamics underlying the propagation of highly energetic partons through a dense medium .",
    "further constraints can be found by i ) measuring different particles species , and in particular heavy quarks , as the formalism predicts the hierarchy @xmath31 ; ii ) by directly measuring the induced radiation , i.e. by reconstructing the jet structure in a heavy ion collision .",
    "new data from rhic on non - photonic electrons @xcite attempt to answer the question on heavy quark in - medium energy loss .",
    "these electrons are expected to come from the decays of charm and beauty quarks . the perturbative description of the relative contribution of both quarks to the electron yield is , however , not under good control and the @xmath32 crossing point can be as low as 2 gev or as large as 10 gev when the usual mass and scale uncertainties are taken into account in the approximation .",
    "this translates into a large uncertainty in the ratio @xmath33 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fighq ] @xcite .",
    "the description of the experimental data is reasonable within the error bars , although not completely satisfactory .",
    "a clear distinction between heavy mass effects in medium - modified gluon radiation seems only possible with a better identification of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 contributions and , ideally , by a direct measurement of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 mesons .",
    "the modification of the jet properties is thought to be the most powerful tool to investigate the medium properties as well as the dynamics underlying jet - quenching .",
    "from an experimental point of view , the callibration uncertainty of true jets in the large background environment of a heavy  ion collision is the main issue to overcome @xcite .",
    "the identification of observables with small sensitivity to background subtractions is of primary importance @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , studying medium  modification of jet shapes in the most general case is complicated and likely would need a full monte carlo implementation of a in - medium parton shower process , which is not yet available . here , we quote a simplified study @xcite which provides a quite good phenomenological understanding of the surprising non - gaussian shape found in two particle correlations at rhic @xcite .",
    "the main observation is that for energies smaller than @xmath38 the typical medium - induced radiation angle reaches its maximum value @xmath39 . in this conditions ,",
    "the medium - induced gluon radiation spectrum has the simple form @xcite @xmath40 taking a typical value @xmath41 gev@xmath30/fm , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cohspec ] ) is valid for @xmath42 3 gev .",
    "compared to the corresponding spectrum in the vacuum , @xmath43 the one in ( [ eq : cohspec ] ) is softer and the typical emission angles larger , producing a broadening of the jet signals .    for practical applications , exclusive distributions , giving the probability of one , two ... emissions are needed . how to construct such probabilities , using sudakov form factors @xmath44 , \\label{eqsudak}\\ ] ] is a well known procedure in the vacuum . in @xcite",
    "it is proposed to generalize this procedure by defining eq .",
    "( [ eqsudak ] ) for the medium by just changing @xmath45 to @xmath46 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cohspec ] ) .",
    "there are convincing motivations to make this _ ansatz _ : ( i ) it provides a clear probabilistic interpretation with the right limit to the most used `` quenching weights '' @xcite when the virtuality is ignored ; ( ii ) the evolution equations in the case of nuclear fragmentation functions in dis can be written as usual dglap equations with medium - modified splitting functions @xmath47 @xcite . in our case",
    "( [ eq : cohspec ] ) would correspond to @xmath48 with the appropriate factors .",
    "two extreme cases were studied in @xcite : ( 1 ) one of the particles takes most of the incoming energy @xmath49 and , hence , @xmath50  `` j - configuration '' ; ( 2 ) the two particles share equally the available energy , @xmath51 and @xmath52  `` y - configuration '' .",
    "_ case ( 1)_. the splitting probability in the laboratory variables @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 presents a non - trivial angular dependence , which we stress has been found by the same perturbative mechanism and parameters describing the inclusive particle suppression .",
    "the distribution found has two maxima whose positions are determined by : @xmath56    the angular shape in ( [ eq : splitlab ] ) is very similar to the one found experimentally . in @xcite a simple model is proposed to take into account the different smearing effects from the experimental triggering conditions .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndist ] for three different medium lengths and @xmath57 gev . to compare with the measured centrality dependence on the position of the maxima @xcite @xmath58 was taken and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndist ]  see @xcite for details .",
    "the above explanation for the non - gaussian shapes found experimentally at rhic has the appeal of presenting a unified description of all high-@xmath20 effects in heavy ",
    "ion collisions measured at rhic .",
    "this effects could be further amplified for jets developing in a flowing medium @xcite .",
    "however , other mechanisms lead to similar away  side correlations . in the most popular one , these angular structures correspond to the shock waves produced by the highly energetic particle traversing the medium @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "a large amount of the energy lost must be transferred to the medium almost instantaneously and take part in the hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "in general the released energy excites both sound and dispersive modes , and only the first ones produce the desired cone  signal ( in the dispersive mode , the energy travels basically collinear with the jet ) .",
    "the energy deposition needed for the sound modes to become visible in the spectrum has been found to be quite large @xcite . to our knowledge , no attempt has been made so far to describe the centrality dependence of the shape of the azimuthal correlations in this approach .",
    "given the fact that the two formalisms rely on completely different hypotheses , finding experimental observables which could distinguish between them is certainly an issue which deserves further investigation .",
    "together with the high-@xmath20 , the most relevant data from rhic so far is the measurement of azimuthal anisotropies in the momentum distributions , which is considered as the main check of themalization in the medium .",
    "as originally proposed @xcite the hydrodynamical evolution of initial spacial anisotropies lead to momentum anisotropies due to the presence of pressure gradients .",
    "although not perfectly , the experimental data from rhic at low and moderate-@xmath20 can be consistently described by considering the formation of a thermalized medium at the very early stages of the collision @xmath59 fm , which evolves as a perfect fluid @xcite  i.e. follows a hydrodynamical evolution with negligible viscosity .",
    "this observation has lead to the developing paradigm of an ideal fluid being created at rhic @xcite .",
    "this state would be a strongly coupled quark gluon plasma , with properties far from those of the asymptotic case of a gas of free quarks and gluons . whether this interpretation is correct or not is a matter of debate at present .",
    "very interesting effects appear in the intermediate region of @xmath60 gev / c .",
    "the most spectacular of them is the appearance of valence quark number scaling laws for baryons and mesons : ( i ) @xmath61 seems to depend only on the valence number of the produced particle ; ( ii ) the elliptic flow parameter @xmath62 is universal when plotted as @xmath63 , @xmath64 being the number of valence quarks .",
    "the most successful model to describe these features is a two component soft+hard model . in this model",
