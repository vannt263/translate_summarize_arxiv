    "free probability theory @xcite originated from questions about the structure of von neumann algebras related to free groups , but has evolved into a subject with links to many other , a priori quite unrelated , fields : most notably random matrices , but also combinatorics , representation theory of large groups , mathematical physics , or as applied fields as financial correlations and wireless communications .",
    "the central notion in the theory is the one of `` free independence '' or `` freeness '' .",
    "this replaces in the context of non - commuting variables the classical notion of independence .",
    "whereas the latter is based on tensor products , free independence is modelled according to free products .",
    "the relation between free probability theory and random matrices relies on the fundamental insight of voiculescu @xcite that typical independent random matrices become asymptotically free in the large @xmath8 limit .",
    "this triggered a surge of new results on operator algebras as well as on random matrices .",
    "based on this , free probability techniques have become prominent in wireless communications @xcite or in computational methods for random matrices @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will provide a solution to the following basic problem in free probability theory .",
    "let @xmath9 be selfadjoint elements which are freely independent .",
    "consider a selfadjoint polynomial @xmath3 in @xmath4 non - commuting variables and let @xmath10 be the element @xmath11 .",
    "how can we calculate the distribution of @xmath10 out of the distributions of @xmath12 ?    by voiculescu s asymptotic freeness results typical random matrices ( like deterministic and independent wigner , wishart , or haar unitary matrices ) become asymptotically free in the large @xmath8 limit .",
    "this means that the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of a random matrix , which is given as some polynomial in such asymptotically free random matrices , is given by the distribution of the corresponding polynomial in free variables .",
    "thus , if we can deal with polynomials in free random variables we can deal with any random matrix of this type .",
    "hence our result yields as a direct consequence also a solution to the following random matrix problem .",
    "let @xmath0 be selfadjoint @xmath1 random matrices which are , for @xmath2 , asymptotically free . consider a selfadjoint polynomial @xmath3 in @xmath4 non - commuting variables and let @xmath5 be the element @xmath6 .",
    "how can we calculate the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of @xmath5 out of the asymptotic eigenvalue distributions of @xmath7 ?    for both problems 1 and 2 there is a long list of contributions which provide solutions for special choices of the polynomial @xmath3 . in the context of free probability , voiculescu solved in @xcite and @xcite problem 1 for the cases of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( corresponding to the additive and multiplicative free convolution ) with the introduction of the @xmath15- and @xmath16-transform , respectively .",
    "nica and speicher could give in @xcite a solution for the problem of the free commutator , @xmath17 .",
    "in the random matrix context , problem 2 was addressed for various polynomials - and usually , also for specific choices of the distributions of the @xmath18 - in work of : marchenko - pastur @xcite , girko @xcite , bai and silverstein @xcite ; tulino and verdu @xcite ; mller @xcite ; moustakis and simon @xcite ; hechem , loubaton , and najim @xcite ; couillet and debbah @xcite ; and many more . for a more extensive list of contributions in this context",
    "we refer to the books @xcite .",
    "some of those situations were also treated by operator - valued free probability tools , see in particular @xcite . the general case for the anti - commutator in the random matrix context , @xmath19 , was treated by vasilchuk @xcite .",
    "all those investigations where specific for the considered polynomial and up to now there has not existed a master algorithm which would work for all polynomials .",
    "we will provide here such a general algorithm .",
    "our solution will rely on a combination of the so - called linearization trick with new advances on the analytic theory of operator - valued convolutions ; from a technical point of view the latter is the main contribution of the present work .",
    "the general philosophy of the linearization trick is that a complicated scalar - valued problem can be transformed into a simpler operator - valued problem .",
    "this idea can be traced back to the early papers @xcite of voiculescu , but has become quite prominent in the seminal paper @xcite of haagerup and thorbjrnsen .",
    "more precisely , the linearization trick from @xcite says that for understanding properties of a polynomial @xmath20 in some ( in general , non - commuting ) variables @xmath12 it suffices to consider a linear polynomial @xmath21 .",
    "the price to pay for this transition from a general to a linear polynomial is that the linear polynomial @xmath22 has operator - valued coefficients ( i.e. , the @xmath23 are matrices , of suitably chosen size , depending on the polynomial @xmath3 , but not on the variables @xmath12 )",
    ". we will be mainly interested in selfadjoint polynomials @xmath3 .",
    "the original approach of haagerup and thorbjrnsen has the drawback that it does not preserve selfadjointness .",
    "recently anderson @xcite refined the linearization trick in that respect , i.e. , he showed that the coefficients @xmath24 can actually be chosen in such a way that @xmath22 is also selfadjoint .",
    "so the linearization trick gives that in order to understand the distribution of @xmath20 it suffices to understand the operator - valued distribution of @xmath22 .",
    "however , @xmath22 is now an operator - valued linear combination of @xmath12 . since basic properties of freeness",
    "imply that the freeness of @xmath12 implies the operator - valued freeness of @xmath25 we get in our situation that the distribution of @xmath22 is given by the operator - valued free convolution of its summands ; the operator - valued distribution of @xmath26 , however , is determined by the distribution of @xmath27 .",
    "so we have reduced our original non - linear problem to a linear one about operator - valued convolution .",
    "there exists already a theory by voiculescu for dealing with such operator - valued convolutions , relying on the so - called operator - valued @xmath15-transform . up to now , this theory has essentially been developed on the level of formal power series , see @xcite .",
    "it has , however , to be remarked that we need a good analytic description of the operator - valued convolution in order to arrive at a useful description of the solution of our problem .",
    "since there is rarely a situation where explicit solutions of those equations are available ( and that holds true for both the scalar - valued and the operator - valued case ) , it is important that the equations are given in a form which are analytically controllable and numerically implementable . in the scalar - valued case is has become more and more apparent in the last years ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that using a subordination approach to free convolution ( which , as also noted  and for the first time explicitly formulated  in @xcite , is equivalent to the @xmath15-transform approach , but has better analytic properties ) is more suited for analytic questions .",
    "the subordination property ( see statements ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) of theorem [ main2 ] below ) has first been proved in @xcite by voiculescu for scalar - valued free additive convolution , with the purpose of investigating @xmath28-regularity of convolution measures in the context of free entropy . in the operator - valued case there",
    "exist also already subordination results , by biane @xcite and voiculescu @xcite , based on a power - series description of the functions involved and algebraic properties of freeness with amalgamation . our main contribution in this article to the question of subordination will be to develop a general analytic theory of subordination for general operator - valued convolutions and to show that the fixed point equations arising from this subordination formulation are indeed analytically controllable and numerically easily implementable .",
    "we also want to point out that the previous works of biane and voiculescu were restricted to a tracial frame ; in our general analytic approach , however , we dot need to assume that our conditional expectation is given with respect to a tracial state , or for that matter that such a state at all exists on the given algebra .",
    "having reduced the problem of polynomials in free variables to operator - valued free additive convolution it is conceivable that further progress on analytic properties of operator - valued convolution will result in understanding qualitative properties of arbitrary selfadjoint polynomials in free variables .",
    "this will be pursued in future investigations . in this context",
    "we want to point out that the absence of atoms for the distribution of selfadjoint polynomials in free semicirculars ( or more generally , in free variables without atoms ) has been established recently by shlyakhtenko and skoufranis @xcite , by quite different methods .",
    "another direction for future work is the extension of the present approach to general , not necessarily selfadjoint polynomials ( where the eigenvalue distribution will be replaced by the brown measure ) .",
    "this will be pursued in @xcite .",
    "the content of the article is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we develop the analytic subordination description of operator - valued convolutions .",
    "theorem [ main2 ] is the main result about this . in section 3",
    ", we will recall the linearization trick , in the form as given by anderson , and streamlined to our needs .",
    "in section 4 , we will combine the linearization trick with our description of operator - valued convolution and show how to solve problem 1 ( and thus also problem 2 ) for general selfadjoint polynomials @xmath3 . in section 5",
    ", we will present some examples , by applying our algorithm to special polynomials and also compare this with numerical simulations of eigenvalue distributions for corresponding random matrices .",

    "it is known @xcite that @xmath61 is commutative and associative .",
    "a very powerful tool for the study of operator - valued distributions is the generalized cauchy - stieltjes transform and its fully matricial extension @xcite : for a fixed @xmath36 , we define @xmath62 $ ] for all @xmath63 for which @xmath64 is invertible in @xmath30 .",

    "note that @xmath422 becomes a @xmath473-algebra by anti - linear extension of @xmath474    [ linearization - existence ] let @xmath405 be a selfadjoint polynomial .",

    "we conclude with the following corollary , which will enable us to shift @xmath446 for @xmath481 to a point @xmath482 lying inside the domain @xmath483 in order to get access to all analytic tools that are available there .",

    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the subordination result for the operator - valued free additive convolution stated in section 2 provides in combination with anderson s version of the linearization trick presented in section 3 an algorithm to calculate the distribution of any selfadjoint polynomial in selfadjoint elements which are freely independent .",

    "only the two statements in step 2 might require an explanation .",
    "firstly , the fact that scalar - valued freeness between the entries of matrices @xmath515 implies freeness over @xmath497 of the matrices themselves is a direct consequence of the definition of freeness .",
    "secondly , the validity of the formula for the operator - valued cauchy transform of @xmath516 in terms of the scalar valued cauchy transform of @xmath508 can be seen as follows : let @xmath517 be the distribution of @xmath518 .",
