    "an important issue in relativistic astrophysics and gravitation theory today has been to rule out the existence of nss in gravitational collapse of massive matter clouds . alternatively",
    ", if nss do exist , even in theory , as endstates of massive stars collapsing under self - gravity towards the end of their life - cycles , the important physical question would then be , how can one decide whether a particular astrophysical compact object is a bh or a ns .",
    "this is a key issue , really at the heart of making physical predictions about very strong gravity regions in the universe , which major astrophysical missions are probing currently @xcite .    in this connection , it is important to examine , in some detail , the kerr geometry configurations and find physical quantities that can be used to differentiate bh from ns .",
    "the kerr spacetime describes either a rotating black hole or a naked singularity , based on the kerr spin parameter @xmath7 , which is the specific angular momentum ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "every compact rotating object has an ergosphere or an ergoregion located outside it .",
    "this region derives its name from the greek word ergon ,  which means work ,   to indicate that it is possible to extract energy from this region .",
    "the ergosphere has an oblate spheroidal shape and touches the event horizon at the pole .",
    "as one moves from the pole to equator , the radius of this region increases and reaches its maximum . in general",
    ", a bh possesses two event horizons and two ergoregions which are the outer and inner event horizons and outer and inner ergoregions .",
    "the region between the outer event horizon and outer ergoradius is called the outer ergoregion or simply the ergoregion . in this paper , we will be primarily concerned with this region .",
    "similarly , the region between the inner event horizon and the inner ergoregion is called the inner ergoregion .",
    "the inner ergoregion is often dismissed as being unphysical since we do nt really know reliably what happens behind the outer event horizon of a rotating bh .",
    "the rotational energy of the bh can be extracted by a particle from the outer ergoregion ( henceforth , just ergoregion ) and this is called penrose process .",
    "the ergoregion is responsible for several interesting phenomena .",
    "one of these has been recently discussed in ref.@xcite where the exact lense - thirring ( lt ) precession frequency of a test gyroscope in kerr spacetime has been derived and shown that the lt precession frequency diverges on the boundary of the ergoregion ( henceforth , ergosurface ) of a bh ( dimensionless kerr parameter @xmath9 ) . in another work @xcite , the spin precession frequency has been discussed in detail in the case of ns ( @xmath10 ) . in the case of the ns , the region between the inner and outer ergo radii",
    "is defined to be the ergoregion .",
    "it has been discussed there that the drastic change in geometry of the ergoregion for @xmath10 , as opposed to @xmath11 , could allow for a differentiation of the two space - times using a physical quantity , which in this case was the precession frequency of gyroscopes placed around these compact objects .",
    "specifically , for the ns configuration , along the pole a finite angle opens up where the ergoregion is absent and @xmath12 can be accessible via this region without passing through the ergoregion .",
    "this region broadens with increasing the value of @xmath13 beyond @xmath14 and the ergoregion shrinks toward the equator .",
    "it was discussed that the precession frequency always diverges on the ergosurface .",
    "since the ergoregion completely bounds a bh , on approaching  it in any direction , one would find a divergence .",
    "whereas , in the case of a ns , the frequency remains finite and regular in the opening angle  due to the absence of the ergoregion .",
    "we find this to be a possible experiment to distinguish the two qualitatively distinct kerr configurations .",
    "previously , it has been discussed in ref.@xcite how a non - rotating black hole can be distinguished from a naked singularity . in this article , we discuss how one can distinguish a bh from a ns using the behavior of the precession frequency of the spin of a test gyro which moves along a non - geodetic orbit around such a kerr compact object . in this regard ,",
    "we find it useful to mention that recently bini et al .",
    "have analyzed the precession of a test gyroscope along bound @xcite and unbound @xcite equatorial plane geodesic orbits around a bh with respect to a static reference frame whose axes point towards fixed stars.it is well known that the paths followed by spinning test particles are not , in general , geodesics @xcite . in our present article , we discuss the precession of a gyroscope both outside and inside the ergoregion of a bh and ns .",
    "we find that the divergence of the spin precession frequency on the ergosurface reported in ref.@xcite can be avoided if the test gyro moves with a non - zero angular velocity @xmath15 . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the motivation was to study the precession of spins of gyroscopes attached to stationary observers , that is , to answer physical questions like how will the gyroscope of an astronaut holding his spaceship at a constant distance from a kerr compact object behave?the four - velocity @xmath16 of stationary gyros  on the ergosurface satisfies @xmath17 , that is , it becomes null .",
    "however , if one introduces an azimuthal component to the four - velocity , the norm can be made non - zero and also time - like .",
    "now , we can describe the behavior of a gyro inside the ergoregion .",
    "we find that the precession frequency of the gyro behaves differently inside the ergoregion of a bh versus that of a ns , due to the presence of the event horizon , therefore rendering it a viable physical quantity that can be used to distinguish a bh from a ns .",
    "later , we examine and investigate the lense - thirring precession frequency and the fundamental frequencies of an accretion disk around a kerr compact object .",
    "stable circular orbits in the equatorial plane for both the bh and ns cases are investigated , and we show that there are important characteristic differences which can be used to distinguish the bh and ns configurations from each other .    specifically , we find that the features of stable circular orbits in the equatorial plane for both the bh and ns cases are noted .",
    "we also show here that the radial and epicyclic frequencies show rather distinct features in the bh and ns cases .",
    "further , in observed qpos from accretion disks , if one finds a clear peak at some radius , then the existence of nss could possibly be established .",
    "observers can remain stationary in a rotating spactime with respect to infinity , only outside the ergoregion .",
    "once inside , it is impossible to remain stationary without changing all three spatial coordinates ( say , @xmath18 ) of their world lines with time . using large amounts of rocket power or some other source of thrust",
    ", an observer can hover very close to the horizon of a schwarzschild bh",
    ". however , this is not possible in the case of a bh since its event horizon lies inside its ergosphere .",
    "however , it is possible to remain fixed at a particular @xmath19 and @xmath20 by rotating with respect to infinity .",
    "thus , the four - velocity of a stationary observer inside the ergoregion can be expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the time coordinate and @xmath15 is the angular velocity of the observer .",
    "@xmath15 has a certain range for which the above velocity describes a time - like observer inside the ergoregion .",
    "the range of @xmath15 can be determined using the condition that @xmath23 should be timelike at each point ( @xmath24 ) of the ergoregion . outside the ergosphere ,",
    "an observer can remain stationary , with zero angular velocity , and their four - velocity given as @xmath25 also , an observer outside the ergoregion can have any angular velocity , that is they can take the form of the velocity mentioned in eq.([ui ] ) with no restriction on @xmath15 .",
    "the spin precession frequency of a test gyro in any stationary spacetime can be expressed in the notation of ref . @xcite as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the timelike killing vector field and @xmath28 is the spin precession frequency in coordinate basis . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the one - forms of @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively and @xmath31 represents the hodge star operator or hodge dual . in any stationary spacetime , @xmath27 can be chosen to be @xmath32 for which eq.([b ] ) becomes the lense - thirring ( lt ) precession frequency ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath34 .",
    "\\label{bs}\\ ] ] in a static spacetime , lt precession vanishes since @xmath35 . on the other hand ,",
    "it does not vanish in a stationary spacetime .",
    "moreover , due to the presence of @xmath36 in the denominator , eq.([b ] ) and eq.([bs ] ) diverge if @xmath37 vanishes . in a stationary and axisymmetric spacetime",
    ", this happens only on the ergosurface , which makes @xmath27 a null vector there . inside the ergoregion",
    ", @xmath27 is no longer timelike but becomes spacelike .",
    "thus , eq.([bs ] ) is invalid inside the ergoregion as well as on its boundary .    to find how precession behavior is modified on entering the ergoregion",
    ", one can introduce an azimuthal component to the four - velocity , as mentioned in sec.[s2 ] and choose @xmath38 inside the ergoregion for which @xmath39 is non - zero on the ergosurface , that is we can choose @xmath40 such that it is timelike on and inside the ergosurface .",
    "we can write this timelike killing vector @xmath40 inside the ergoregion as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a spacelike killing vector in that stationary and axisymmetric spacetime .",
    "this means that this particular spacetime is independent of @xmath43 and @xmath44 coordinates .",
    "therefore , the corresponding co - vector of @xmath40 can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 in 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "separating space and time components we can write @xmath47 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 . since we are mainly interested in the ergoregion of a stationary and axisymmetric spacetime , we can abolish @xmath50 and @xmath51 terms .",

    "the reason behind stopping at @xmath12 is that it is fairly widely accepted that quantum gravity will resolve the singularity resulting in a compact overspinning object with boundary at a positive value of @xmath19 , which is referred to as superspinar  @xcite .",

    "now , if we set @xmath123 , the kerr spacetime reduces to the schwarzschild spacetime , which is _ non - rotating_. substituting @xmath123 in eq.([genex ] ) , we obtain @xmath124 where @xmath15 can take any value ( provided @xmath23 should be timelike ) and always be timelike . since the schwarzschild spacetime is spherically symmetric , we can write eq.([sc ] ) for @xmath81 as @xmath125 this implies that a gyro which is moving in spherically symmetric spacetime , will in fact precess .",
    "if the gyro moves along a circular geodesic @xmath15 should be the kepler frequency , i.e. , @xmath126 .",
    "therefore , eq.([sce ] ) reduces to @xmath127 the expression above which gives the precession frequency is expressed in the copernican frame and is the rate which is computed with respect to the proper time @xmath128 .",
    "the proper time @xmath128 measured in the copernican frame is related to the coordinate time @xmath22 via @xmath129 .",
    "thus the precession frequency @xmath130 in the coordinate basis is given by @xmath131 now , we ask what the frequency associated with the change in the angle of the spin vector over , say , one complete revolution around the central object is . as mentioned above @xmath132 .",
    "this becomes one purely of kinematics and using the formalism outlined in @xcite , one can then write down the frequency of precession , which is actually just the geodetic precession frequency ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "this frequency turns out simply to be the difference between the kepler frequency and rotation frequency and is given by , @xmath134 this agrees with the results quoted in the literature @xcite .",
    "in this section , we point out the characteristic differences in the behavior of the spin precession frequency ( @xmath56 ) of test gyroscopes for bhs and nss .",
    "we show that the value of @xmath56 diverges for gyroscopes with @xmath135 in the case of a bh , for all values of @xmath94 except @xmath136 . whereas , for a ns , @xmath56 always remains finite upto @xmath12 .",
    "we obtain distinguishing characteristic features in the radial profile of @xmath56 for both bh and ns cases , which we will discuss as we proceed .",
    "moreover , we also obtain features in the radial profile of @xmath56 that could help distinguish near - extremal ns from higher spin nss ( for eg , near extremal nss have more than one local maxima and/or local minima and/or plateaus between @xmath137 ) .",
    "we explore the details of such features and argue that they provide us with a possible distinguishing criterion to separate out near - extremal ns ( @xmath138 ) from those with higher spins ( @xmath139 ) ( sec.[nens ] ) .",
    "now , substituting the value of @xmath15 for different @xmath94 ( see eq.[q ] ) in eq.([genex ] ) and eq.([ab ] ) , we can obtain the final expression ( eq.([gnx ] ) ) of @xmath93 and plot the gyro precession frequency .",
    "for bhs , we can see from all the panels ( a)-(i ) of fig.[plbh ] that the precession frequency diverges close to the horizon in all directions for all values of @xmath13 and for all values of @xmath94 except @xmath136 . for @xmath140 ( panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) ,",
    "the nature of the plots are almost same but for @xmath141 , a ` kink ' appears at some intermediate angles .",
    "for very low values of @xmath13 , the ` kink ' starts to appear close to the equatorial plane and if the value of @xmath13 is increased the kink starts to appear at a lower angular value . as an example , for @xmath142 , the kink starts to appear at @xmath143 ( panel(e ) ) and it is very prominent at @xmath144 ( panel(f ) ) whereas for @xmath87 , kink starts to appear at @xmath145 ( panel(h ) ) and it is more prominent than the previous case at @xmath143 ( panel(i ) ) .",
    "thus , we can state that the spin precession frequency is finite both inside and outside of the ergoregion and there is no discontinuity at all but it diverges near the horizon .",
    "remarkably , for @xmath136 , the precession frequency remains finite ( see panel(c ) and ( d ) of fig.[plbh ] ) for gyros orbiting close to the horizon , with the velocity of the gyro proportional to @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is obtained from eq.([ch ] ) .",
    "for all other choices of @xmath94 in the allowed range , the precession frequency shows a divergence for gyros with @xmath135 .    we have plotted the spin precession frequencies in panels ( a)-(g ) of fig.[plns ] for the ns case @xmath148 .",
    "as can be seen from these plots , the spin precession frequencies do not diverge like the bh case but remain finite and regular even as one approaches @xmath149 for all angles @xmath150 , irrespective of the presence of the ergoregion , as opposed to @xcite , where it was shown that the spin precession frequency diverges on the ergosurface for nss . at @xmath151 ,",
    "the precession frequency diverges because of the presence of the ring singularity .",
    "this is also in stark contrast to the bh case in the present paper , for which a divergence is exhibited by the precession frequency close to the event horizon , as discussed earlier .",
    "one also finds that a local minima and a local maxima appear for @xmath152 in some intermediate angles . as an example , for @xmath136 , local minima appears very close to the pole ( @xmath153 ) and disappears at @xmath154 whereas for @xmath155 local maxima - minima starts to appear at @xmath156 and disappears @xmath157 .",
    "thus , for higher @xmath94 value local maxima - minima lasts for shorter angular range .",
    "the above mentioned characteristics is not only applicable for @xmath92 but also applicable for all the ns cases of @xmath158 .",
    "we now detail our experiment to distinguish a ns from a bh .",
    "we study the precession of spins of gyros attached to observers with a non - zero azimuthal component ( @xmath159 ) to their four - velocities , that is @xmath160 .",
    "these are observers moving along circles at constant @xmath19 and @xmath161 .",
    "as discussed earlier , there are no restrictions on @xmath0 outside the ergoregion .",
    "however , not all values of @xmath0 are allowed inside the ergoregion since we want the four - velocities @xmath40 to be time - like . for every curve with fixed @xmath162 inside the ergoregion , we can find the range of allowed @xmath163 by finding @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "one characteristic feature of the ergoregion is that as one allows @xmath0 to approach the bounding values , @xmath166 , the precession frequency @xmath167 exhibits a sharp rise .",
    "now , we consider a set of observers ( say , at different @xmath19 ) , equipped with gyroscopes , moving on constant @xmath168 curves around an unknown rotating compact astrophysical object .",
    "there are two possible observations one can make when one measures the precession frequency of the spins of gyroscopes attached to such observers , with progressively decreasing @xmath19 : ( i ) @xmath169 continually increases ( we may also see features like those in panels ( f ) and ( i ) of fig.[plbh ] ) and after crossing a certain distance it diverges eventually ; or ( ii ) it increases and after crossing a certain distance it decreases continuously and remains finite throughout ( we may also see features like those in panels ( c ) and ( f ) of fig.[plns ] )",
    ". then we can conclude that in a kerr spacetime , case ( i ) signals that the spacetimes is that of a bh whereas , case ( ii ) implies that we have a ns instead .",
    "a near - extremal ns ( @xmath172 ) exhibits characteristically different features as compared to nss with higher spins , that is we do not observe trends like those in fig.[plns ] for near - extremal nss . moreover , observed features are extremely dependent on @xmath94 values .",
    "two minima occur for intermediate values of @xmath20 when spin parameter is close to one and @xmath94 close to @xmath170 .",
    "we can see from fig.[q.47 ] that two minima occur at the angle @xmath173 ( panel(b ) and panel(d ) ) and its nearby angles for @xmath174 .",
    "one minima disappears around @xmath175 and another one still remains ( panel(c ) ) .",
    "these all ` peculiarities ' go away when we increase the spin parameter further , i.e. , @xmath139 .",

    "the above expressions simplify greatly for the equitorial plane @xmath192 as @xmath193 and a simple but qualitative analytic treatment of the problem is admitted .",
    "we can then discuss the number of poles and peaks of the spin precession frequency of near extremal superspinars inside the ergoregion , confining ourselves to the equatorial plane .    from the above expressions it is clear that the radial part of this frequency vanishes everywhere in the equatorial plane of the ergoregion except at the ring singularity , for all allowed frequencies @xmath0 .",

    "many interesting physical processes occur in near - extremal kerr geometry at @xmath179 .",
    "these processes include ultra - high energy particle collisions and collisional penrose process with extremely large efficiency of energy extraction .    in @xcite , we considered two particles which follow geodesic motion on the equatorial plane of overspinning kerr geometry starting from rest at infinity and undergo a collision at @xmath179 .",
    "one of the particles that is initially ingoing , turns back at radial coordinate @xmath196 and appears at @xmath179 as an outgoing particle , while the second particle is ingoing .",
    "we showed that the center of mass energy of collision between the radially ingoing and outgoing particles shows divergence in the near - extremal limit where kerr spin parameter transcends the extremal value by an infinitesimal amount , i.e. , @xmath197 with @xmath198 .",
    "this process overcomes many limitations and finetunings involved in an analogous high - energy collision process between the two ingoing particles which occurs close to the event horizon of the maximally spinning bh @xcite .",
    "we further showed that the particles which are produced in the ultra - high energy particle collisions in the overspinning kerr spacetime can escape to infinity with divergent energies @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the collisional penrose process which allows us to extract rotational energy from the ergoregion of the kerr spacetime .",
    "the efficiency of the collisional penrose shows divergence in the near - extremal limit for the collisions which occur at @xmath179 , making it possible to extract large amount of energy from the overspinning kerr geometry .",
    "this is in the stark contrast with the bh case where efficiency is shown to be always finite with an upper bound of @xmath199 @xcite .",
    "thus near - extremal ns spacetime can possibly be the source of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos .",
    "interestingly , as we showed earlier in this section , gyro precession frequency shows a sharp increase or decline close to @xmath179 in near - extremal overspinning kerr spacetime as we decrease its radial coordinate along the constant value of @xmath161 .",
    "this is precisely the location where ultra - high energy collisions and collisional penrose process with divergent efficiency occurs .",
    "thus a thought experiment to lower gyro which we described in this paper kills two birds with the same bullet .",
    "firstly it allows us to identify the spacetime geometry which is conducive to the high - energy processes as it can tell us whether the geometry is overspinning and near - extremal . secondly it also helps us to locate region in space which can host high - energy processes as gyro frequency exhibits peculiar trend exactly at this location .",
    "this coincidence is quite remarkable .",
    "in order to study the accretion disk around a spinning bh , one needs to study the stable circular orbits in the kerr space - time .",
    "the last or innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) marks the inner boundary of this disk .",
    "the isco radius depends on the kerr parameter @xmath13 , as shown in fig .",
    "this is a key underlying physical feature that can distinguish bhs from nss , as we will see in this section .",
    "the three fundamental frequencies for the accretion disk , namely the keplerian frequency @xmath200 , vertical epicyclic frequency @xmath201 , and the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath202 are derived for the kerr metric @xcite ( in geometrized units ) as , @xmath203 where the upper sign is applicable for direct orbit and the lower one for retrograde orbit .",
    "these frequencies are related to the precession of the orbit and orbital plane .",
    "precession of the orbit is measured by the periastron precession frequency @xmath204 , and orbital plane precession is measured by the nodal plane precession or lense - thirring precession frequency @xmath205 @xcite .",
    "these two frequencies are defined as @xcite @xmath206    orbital plane precession arises only due to the rotation of the spacetime . in a non - rotating spacetime , @xmath200 is always equal to @xmath201 , and hence the lense - thirring precession is entirely absent .",
    "however , periastron precession occurs both in rotating and non - rotating spacetimes .",
    "we note that the square of the radial epicyclic frequency @xmath207 vanishes at the isco , and is negative for smaller radii , which shows a radial instability for such orbits . outside the isco",
    ", @xmath207 is always positive and @xmath208 is always non - zero and positive in a rotating spacetime .",
    "the same can not be said about @xmath209 .",
    "for example , the lt precession frequency ( eq.([no ] ) ) can be zero at @xmath210 given by , @xmath211 since @xmath4 is always less than @xmath212 ( @xmath213 @xcite ) and even inside the event horizon for a bh ( @xmath214 ) , the lt precession frequency never becomes zero for a bh spacetime .",
    "we now discuss the location of the isco in a ns spacetime and argue that its relation with @xmath4 has implications for distinguishing bh and ns spacetimes .",
    "three radial quantities ( in units of @xmath215 ) for prograde orbits , namely the isco radius ( black ) , the ergoradius ( dashed gray ) , and the radius ( @xmath4 ) at which the precession frequency ( @xmath209 ) vanishes ( blue ) , plotted as functions of the dimensionless kerr parameter @xmath216 .",
    "the isco radius lies outside the ergoregion for all @xmath13 except @xmath217 .",
    "@xmath4 meets the isco radius at @xmath2 .",
    "this has the implication that for smaller values of @xmath13 , the lt frequency is always positive and does not vanish for any radius . for larger values",
    ", there is a domain of @xmath19 for which this frequency becomes negative , signifying that the lt effect switches sign . since this feature is exhibited for @xmath218 , the lt frequency in a bh spacetime never vanishes .",
    "we point out that nss with @xmath219 also do not display vanishing lt frequency . ]",
    "[ isco ] shows that the isco radius decreases with increasing @xmath13 for prograde orbits for both bhs and nss up to @xmath220 , and then increases @xcite .",
    "therefore , the minimum isco radius , having the value @xmath221 , occurs for @xmath2 . as seen from fig .",
    "[ isco ] , the isco lies on or inside the ergosurface for @xmath217 . for each @xmath13 value",
    ", there exists a radius ( @xmath4 ) at which there is no frame - dragging effect , and hence the lt precession vanishes .",
    "this radius is less than the isco radius for @xmath219 ( fig .",
    "[ isco ] ) , but this may not be observationally important , as the accretion disk extends up to @xmath212 .",
    "[ isco ] also shows that @xmath4 equals @xmath212 for @xmath222 @xcite , and is greater than @xmath212 for @xmath223 .",

    "but for nss , the lt frequency attains a maximum at @xmath225 which occurs always at @xmath226 ( see table [ table_1 ] ) , and then decreases as @xmath19 decreases ( fig .",

    "[ or ] shows that a small additional peak appears in the plot of @xmath202 profile for the near extremal value of @xmath13 in the case of a ns .",
    "such a peak appears at small radius values , where an accretion disk can not exist in case of a bh .",

    "sometimes two hf qpos are seen together .",
    "their frequencies are observed to be in the range of several tens to several hundreds of hz .",
    "for example , while xte 1650500 has shown hf qpos in the range of @xmath254 hz , 4u 1630 - 47 has shown such qpos in @xmath255 hz @xcite .",

    "following this idea , frequencies of the c - type lf qpo , the lower frequency hf qpo and the higher frequency hf qpo of bhxbs are identified with @xmath209 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 respectively @xcite .",
    "this can be useful to measure both the mass ( @xmath215 ) and @xmath13 of the compact object , as demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "table  [ table_1 ] shows that the observed lf qpos could be identified with @xmath209 only for @xmath259 and @xmath260 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath209 could have a much higher value for @xmath13 closer to 1 for both bh and ns , and it could be possible to identify an hf qpo with @xmath209 ( table  [ table_1 ] ) . if @xmath13 is very close to @xmath14",
    ", @xmath209 value is quite high ( table  [ table_1 ] ) , and such high frequency qpos could be detected in future for bh and ns with @xmath261 .",
    "while there are uncertainties in the specific identifications of observed frequencies with the theoretical ones , the recent discovery of the c - type quasi - periodic variation of the broad relativistic iron line energy from the bhxb h1743322 strongly suggests that the inner accretion disk of this source is indeed tilted and precessing @xcite .",
    "therefore , the theoretical dependencies of various frequencies on @xmath13 , as discussed in this section , have potential to distinguish between a bh and a ns .",
    "how could this be done ?",
    "here we give some examples .",
    "note that most of the bhxbs are transient sources , and an accretion disk is formed only during an outburst . even for the persistent bhxbs , source state often changes , which implies changes in accretion components .",
    "so it is expected that the accretion disk of a given bhxb sometimes advances towards the central object , and sometimes recedes , depending on the source intensity and spectral states .",
    "if qpos are connected to the natural frequencies mentioned above , then such a dynamics of the disk would mean changes in qpo frequencies , as these frequencies depend on the radial distance .",
    "and we do observe evolution of qpo frequencies .",
    "as a bh and a ns have significantly different theoretical radial profiles of frequencies , it could be , in principle , possible to distinguish them by tracking the evolution of qpo frequencies as the disk advances or recedes .",
    "for example , @xmath209 for a bh will monotonically increase , and will attain the maximum value , if the disk advances up to the isco radius .",
    "but @xmath209 for a ns will first increase , will attain the maximum value , and then will decrease , as the disk advances up to @xmath232 , which can be quite different from the @xmath232 of bhs .",
    "in fact , in case of a ns , the absolute value of @xmath209 can become zero and then increase again . whether this will happen , and radial locations of the maximum and zero values of @xmath209 depend on @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the lense - thirring precession can provide a way to distinguish between a bh and a ns .",
    "similarly , the maximum possible value of @xmath234 depends on @xmath13 .",
    "finally , according to the above mentioned model , @xmath202 is interpreted as the separation between two hf qpo frequencies .",
    "therefore , the qualitatively different @xmath202 radial profiles for nss with @xmath262 can be useful to distinguish them from bhs .",
    "the spin precession precession frequency of test gyros , in the bh case , are finite inside and outside of the ergoregion but diverge as one considers a gyro close to the horizon , @xmath263 , for any direction ( @xmath264 ) . this feature can also help us to detect the horizon of a bh . in case of the ns , spin precession frequency of gyros remain finite and regular even if one considers gyros close to @xmath104 , for all @xmath20 in the range : @xmath265 , with a suitable value of @xmath15 .",
    "maxima / minima in the radial profile of the precession frequency ( for eg .",
    ", two local maxima or two local minima or two peaks or three peaks with a plateau ) would indicate a near - extremal ns  with @xmath266 since such features are completely absent in a bh or a ns with higher angular momentum @xmath267 .    in case of the nodal plane precession , related to the accretion disc",
    ", we can summarize here the distinctive features of the lt frequency in both bh and ns spacetimes , using which one can make a conclusive statement regarding the existence of a ns :          \\(iv ) additionally , @xmath268 shows an adverse  effect : @xmath272 ( where @xmath273 , see fig.[nod ] ) in the region @xmath274 . this curve does not follow the inverse cube law of distance like other astrophysical objects .",
    "all these features are completely absent in the case of bh and this would be reflected in the observation of frequencies of qpos .",
    "+ finally , it can be seen from fig.[or ] and fig.[oth ] that @xmath275 and @xmath276 also have some characteristic differences in the cases of bh and ns by which it may be possible to detect a ns if @xmath275 and @xmath276 are the observationally measurable quantities .",

    "<S> we then investigate the lense - thirring ( lt ) precession or nodal plane precession frequency , and other fundamental frequencies , for the accretion disk around a bh and ns to show that clear distinctions exist for bh and ns configurations in terms of radial variation features . </S>",
    "<S> the lt precession in equatorial circular orbits increases closer to bh , but for ns it increases , attains a peak and then decreases . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for @xmath2 , it decreases to reach @xmath3 for certain @xmath4 , and acquires negative values for @xmath5 . for @xmath6 , </S>",
    "<S> a peak appears , but vanishing or negative lt frequency   are avoided . </S>",
    "<S> hence there are important differences in accretion disk lt frequencies for bh and ns . </S>",
    "<S> as lt frequencies are intimately related to and can cause the observed qpos , this may allow to determine whether a given astrophysical object is bh or ns . </S>"
