    "mutual interactions between galaxies are probably one of the main processes leading to the formation of presently observed galaxies . the discovery of shells and ripples around elliptical galaxies ( kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ; tal et al .  2009 ) and of extended stellar tidal features around normal disc galaxies ( martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2010 ) are among the most compelling evidence for this scenario . in more extreme and rare cases the remnants of the interacting galaxies",
    "are not mixed in one smooth object , but some of the material settles quasi - statically into the equatorial plane of the main body , forming a polar - ring galaxy ( prg ; whitmore et al .  1990 ) .",
    "alternatively , simulations show that the polar structure can form as the result of a `` secondary event '' during the evolution of the galaxy , involving the accretion of gas from a close , gas - rich dwarf companion ( reshetnikov & sotnikova 1997 ) .    however , both formation scenarios are difficult to validate observationally since they predict the formation of a polar ring on short time scales of less than 1 - 2 gyr ( bekki 1998 ; bournaud & combes 2003 ) . since only about 0.5 per cent of all early - type galaxies have observable polar rings ( whitmore et al",
    ".  1990 ) , on - going galaxy interactions that form a prg are probably extremely rare events .",
    "a galaxy tidally disrupted while still in orbit around a much more luminous and massive companion should leave distinctive tidal stellar features before merging with the central galaxy or mixing into a seemingly smooth component .",
    "these stellar debris can extend well beyond the central galaxy and mostly occur at a very low surface brightness level , making it difficult to detect in sky survey images .",
    "in this paper we present an interpretation of existing observational data of the object sdss j132533.22 + 272246.7 ( hereafter referred to as rg ) identified as a ring galaxy during a supernova survey in the subaru deep field ( sdf ; graur et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the object is centred at @xmath2 ( j2000 ) at a redshift of @xmath3 , which puts it at a distance of about 250 mpc , assuming @xmath4 km sec@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ obs ] gives a description of the observations and data reduction ; in section [ results ] we present the observational results along with our interpretation of the object and the main conclusions are summarized in section [ conc ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      prgs are believed to form as a result of a dissipative galaxy merger between two disc galaxies , or by the accretion of gas from a small gas - rich companion by a pre - existing s0 galaxy ( see bekki 1998 ; bournaud & combes 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "distinguishing between these two kinds of scenarios can be addressed by examining their morphology and by observing polar - ring formation in action in the local universe .",
    "prgs are typically divided into two groups : ( 1 ) galaxies with an unusually compact and faint bulge and an extended disc - like ring with the central region cut out ; ( 2 ) galaxies with a dominant bulge and a narrow ring which is not extended in radius ( whitmore 1991 ; reshetnikov & sotnikova 1997 ) .",
    "rg seems to fit into the second category . among known prgs , rg resembles eso 415-g26 by its faint narrow ring ( see e.g.  fig .  2 of iodice et al .",
    "2002a ) , central body morphology , red colours and the presence of tidal features extending beyond the host ( e.g.  loops and debris , see whitmore et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "the morphology of a prg formed in a merger event depends not only on the orbital parameters , but also on the initial mass ratio of the two disc galaxies .",
    "for instance , a mass ratio larger than @xmath6 can reproduce both the central discy s0 host and the inclined narrow ring of eso 415-g26 ( bekki 1998 ) .",
    "in this view , the diffusely dispersed material around rg can be explained as stars pushed out from the victim galaxy during a head - on collision with a larger , more massive galaxy .",
    "the faint stellar features around rg are due to polar material oscillating at large and small radii before gathering in the ring , and the interacting companion is expected to eventually merge with the central object ( bournaud & combes 2003 ) .",
    "this scenario , previously proposed by whitmore , mcelroy & schweizer ( 1987 ) for eso 415-g26 , places strong constraints on the age of the system . considering the off - centre position of the ring and the distinctive structural features surrounding the main body ,",
    "we conclude that rg is only a few dynamical periods old and is still developing ( see also schweizer , whitmore & rubin 1983 ) .",
    "a scenario in which gas was accreted from a gas - rich companion onto rg can be safely ruled out .",
    "in such a scenario , no clear sign relating the ring and the accreted companion is expected to be left even 1 or 2 gyr after the ring has formed .",
    "the accreted matter , including only few stars , falls directly into a polar orbit and therefore a stellar halo around the polar ring is not expected , contrary to the merging scenario ( bournaud & combes 2003 ) .",
    "understanding the role played by different mechanisms in prg formation requires a deep photometric study of a large sample of such objects at various redshifts .",
    "the redshift of rg places it between the high-@xmath7 prg - candidates found in _",
    "hst _ observations ( reshetnikov 1997 ; lavery et al .  2004 ; reshetnikov & dettmar 2007 ) and the low-@xmath7 prgs published and studied by whitmore et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and others . however , observed prgs that could bridge the distance gap are very rare since they are difficult to detect by large and shallow surveys such as the sdss ( see brosch et al .",
    "in particular , detecting tidal features or merger remnants in such systems often requires exquisite surface brightness sensitivity ( tal et al .",
    "2009 ; smirnova , moiseev & afanasiev 2010 ; martnez - delgado et al .",
    "rg is an excellent example , since the polar ring and the complex stellar halo structure could probably not have been detected by a cursory examination of sky survey images .",
    "we present a photometric study of a candidate prg in the sdf .",
    "the object has a complex structure consisting of : + 1 . a central host",
    "which we identify as a @xmath0 gyr old early - type galaxy with an exponential bulge and a nearly edge - on disc ; + 2 . a faint off - centre narrow ring at a @xmath1 angle to the polar axis of the host ; + 3 .",
    "a low surface brightness stellar halo extending asymmetrically on both sides of the ring ; + 4 .",
    "at least two disrupted stellar debris in intermediate position angles between the ring and the polar axis of the host ; + 5 .",
    "two outer loops on both sides in the direction of the stellar debris . +",
    "our morphological study suggests that this galaxy belongs to the group of bulge - dominated prgs and that the ring was probably formed around the pre - existing host during a merger with a gas - rich dwarf companion .",
    "this event probably took place less than 1 - 2 gyr ago , since it appears that the captured material has not yet fully dispersed into the halo or settled into the polar structure .",
    "the authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
    "we are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain .",
    "this publication makes use of data products from the two micron all sky survey , which is a joint project of the university of massachusetts and the infrared processing and analysis center / california institute of technology , funded by the national aeronautics and space administration and the national science foundation .",
