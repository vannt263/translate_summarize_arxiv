    "dimer - based antiferromagnets ( dafs ) under a magnetic field are promising candidates for displaying new phases of bosonic matter.@xcite magnetic excitations in such systems , termed _ triplons _ , are well described by lattice models of interacting bosons , whose density can be finely tuned by varying the magnitude of the applied field.@xcite experimentally , field - induced bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of triplons has been observed in a number of dafs ( see the review ref .  ) and , remarkably , exotic quantum criticality has been detected in the spin - dimer compound @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the presence of magnetic frustration further adds to the rich phenomenology of these systems by enhancing repulsive interactions between triplons , something that may eventually stabilize incompressible phases that break the lattice s translational symmetry.@xcite such _ crystalline _ phases are for instance realized in the shastry - sutherland material @xmath1,@xcite where they are signaled by a series of magnetization plateaux at unconventional fillings stabilized by complex triplon interactions .",

    "indeed , insofar as more exotic possibilities are excluded,@xcite according to the ginzburg - landau - wilson paradigm a continuous transition between phases breaking different symmetries ( as it is the case with bec and crystalline phases ) is precluded and we are therefore left with two possibilities : ( i ) a first - order transition or ( ii ) the appearance of an intermediate phase , where both order parameters coexist , termed spin - supersolid ( spin - ss ) in the present context .",

    "more recently,@xcite state - of - the - art techniques have been employed in deriving effective models that improve upon the third - order effective hamiltonian of ref .  .",
    "unfortunately , the reliability of these methods is still limited to inter - dimer couplings equal to , at most , one - half of the intra - dimer coupling , and in that parameter range the different plateaux seem to be separated by first - order transitions without any convincing evidence of spin - ss phases.@xcite    the situation is much clearer for the daf investigated in ref .   where repulsion among triplons are enhanced due to the strong ising - like character of the inter - dimer exchange [ see eq .",
