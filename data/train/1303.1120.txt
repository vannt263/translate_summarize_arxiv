    "this paper completes the study of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to the production of massive vector color - octet bosons at the lhc and tevatron begun in @xcite . in this analysis",
    ", we use the generic name `` colorons '' to refer to massive color - octet vector bosons , regardless of the details of their couplings to fermions .",
    "colorons are a feature of a variety of models , including axigluon models @xcite , topcolor models @xcite , technicolor models with colored technifermions @xcite , flavor - universal @xcite and chiral @xcite coloron models , and extra - dimensional models with kk gluons @xcite .",
    "the tree - level hadron - collider phenomenology of colorons has been discussed extensively in various experimental and theoretical contexts , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "searches for resonances in the dijet mass spectrum at the lhc are now , depending on the details of how the coloron couples , sensitive up to coloron masses of order 4 - 5 tev @xcite .",
    "if there are color - octet vector bosons associated with the electroweak symmetry breaking sector , as suggested by several of the models mentioned above , their presence should be uncovered by the lhc .",
    "in particular , in this paper we provide a complete and consistent calculation of the gluon fusion contribution to coloron production .",
    "this amplitude vanishes at tree level @xcite , and therefore occurs initially at one - loop and is finite . despite the large gluon parton luminosity at the tevatron and the lhc ,",
    "we show that the gluon - fusion contribution to coloron production is typically four orders of magnitude smaller than the contribution from quark annihilation .. ] coloron production via gluon fusion is therefore only relevant if the colorons are ( nearly ) fermiophobic , with quark couplings of order @xmath0 or smaller .",
    "we also update previous results on the nlo k - factor for coloron production using more modern structure functions ( ct10 @xcite ) and present extensive plots and tables of our results for nlo coloron production at the tevatron and at the lhc for energies of @xmath1 , 8 , and 14 tev .",
    "following @xcite , we compute the gauge- , quark- , and self - couplings of the coloron from a theory with an extended @xmath2 gauge structure , where @xmath3 is identified with qcd . as noted there , the self - couplings of kk gluons in extra - dimensional models , or of colored technivector mesons in technicolor models , will not precisely follow this pattern .",
    "our calculations continue to apply approximately to these cases , however , to the extent that the @xmath4 model is a good low - energy effective theory for the extra dimensional model ( a  two - site \" approximation in the language of deconstruction @xcite ) or for the technicolor theory ( a hidden local symmetry approximation for the effective technivector meson sector @xcite ) .",
    "our calculation of the gluon fusion contribution to coloron production uses the  pinch \" technique @xcite to simplify the calculation and demonstrate the gauge - invariance of our result .",
    "previous considerations of this process were either incomplete @xcite , ignoring the contribution from vector - boson loops , or assumed color gauge - invariance without explicitly checking the consistency of the calculation @xcite . while our results confirm that the contribution of gluon fusion to coloron production is small , we find that the contribution is typically an order of magnitude smaller than reported in @xcite",

    "the quark couplings to the coloron , on the other hand , may be chosen to be chiral , and is in general parametrized by the @xmath36 and @xmath37 couplings , representing respectively the couplings of the left- and right - handed quarks to the coloron .",
    "these couplings depend on how one decides to charge the quarks under the original extended gauge group .",
    "in general , each of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 parameters in any specific model can take on the values and @xmath37 should be matrices in flavor space . for simplicity , in what follows , we assume that the coloron couplings are flavor - universal  the generalization to the flavor - dependent case is straightforward .",
    "flavor - changing couplings are , however , strongly constrained @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath38 for example , if both left - handed and right - handed quarks are only charged under @xmath39 , then @xmath40 , resulting in a vector - like theory . a chiral example would be the axigluon ( with the maximal mixing , @xmath41 ) @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath42 . for later convenience ,",
    "we introduce the coefficients @xmath43 the interaction vertices and the corresponding feynman rules are presented in the appendix  [ fr ] .",
    "gluon - initiated production of colorons can not proceed at tree - level , as there are no gauge - invariant dimension - four operators accommodating such interaction ( see the feynman rules in the appendix  [ fr ] ) : in general , there are no dimension - four terms with two gauge bosons of an unbroken symmetry and a vector field charged under the same symmetry . at one - loop ,",
    "however , a coloron can be produced by fusing two initial - state gluons .",
    "naively , one might expect the cross section of this process to be negligible as compared with the tree - level quark - initiated production channel and its higher - order contributions .",
    "however , at a high - cm energy hadron collider , such as the lhc , there are many more gluons available to facilitate this fusion process .",
    "it is , therefore , important to investigate the rate of this production channel , and draw quantitative comparisons with the tree - level induced process which proceeds via the quark - antiquark pair annihilation .    in this section , we compute the leading order amplitude for coloron production via gluon fusion , which is induced at one - loop .",
    "we employ the narrow - width approximation for the coloron , take all the external gauge bosons to be on - shell , and set the quark masses to zero : given the current tev lower bounds on the coloron mass @xcite these approximations are justified even for the top - quark .",

    "these pinched structures , possessing a different topology than their primitive diagrams , may then be removed from the original calculation and reassigned to the computation of diagrams elsewhere in the theory that share the same topology .",
    "this leaves behind only the gauge - invariant unpinched contribution in the original calculation . as such",
    ", employing the pinch technique allows one to exhibit the consistent renormalization and gauge - invariance of the one - loop amplitude in a non - abelian theory , by recovering qed - like ward identities through a systematic reshuffling of different terms within the amplitude . throughout the paper ,",
    "we denote the unpinched and pinched diagrams symbolically by inserting a black disk over their relevant vertices , in order to distinguish them from their primitive diagrams .      the gluon fusion to coloron process facilitated by the vacuum polarization amplitudes that mix colorons with gluons ( henceforth called mixed - vpa ) is shown in fig .",

    "<S> this paper completes the study of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to massive color - octet vector boson production at the lhc and tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> the massive color - octet vector bosons are generically referred to as colorons . building on our previous calculation of quark - initiated coloron production at nlo , we use the pinch technique to investigate coloron production via gluon fusion . we demonstrate that this one - loop production amplitude is finite , and find that its numerical contribution to coloron production is typically four orders of magnitude smaller than the contribution from quark annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> coloron production via gluon fusion is therefore only relevant if the colorons are ( nearly ) fermiophobic . </S>",
    "<S> we then present extensive plots and tables of our full results for nlo coloron production at the tevatron and the lhc . </S>"
