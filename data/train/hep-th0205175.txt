    "note that the operators @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be chosen as a basis for a realization of the @xmath56 lie algebra .",
    "when projected the @xmath57 operators in the even sector we obtain that @xmath58 and together with @xmath59 generate once again the lie algebra @xmath60    consequently , for calogero interaction the resultanting lie algebra is @xmath61    @xmath62_-=ik_2 , \\quad   [ k_1 , k_2]_-=-ik_0 , \\quad [ k_2 , k_0]_-=-ik_1.\\ ] ]    indeed , from ( [ ich ] ) , ( [ b- ] ) and ( [ b+ ] ) we obtain @xmath63 and @xmath64 therefore one can generate the generalized coherent states according to perelomov @xcite .",

    "however , one obtain this properties from our operators deduced via the super - realization of the r - deformed heisenberg .",
    "let us begin by making some remarks about the ccs and the minimum uncertainty coherent states ( mucs ) of wigner oscillator .",
    "the ccs of wigner annihilation operator which satisfies the r - deformed heisenberg algebra are defined by    @xmath83    and can be written in terms of the wigner oscillator eigenstates    @xmath84    where the eigenvalue @xmath85 can be any complex number .    from the definition of the position @xmath86 and momentum @xmath87 quantum operators given by eqs .",
    "( [ loa ] ) and ( [ e8 ] ) we have the following commutation relation    @xmath88_- = i [ 1 + 2(\\lambda+1)\\sigma_3].\\ ] ]    thus , there is a generalised uncertainty relation for @xmath86 and @xmath89 given by    @xmath90    we show that the product of uncertainties of the wigner oscillator position @xmath86 and momentum @xmath87 in the ccs becomes minimal among those values which are permissible by quantum mechanics , viz . , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the average value in the wigner oscillator ccs .",
    "for instance note that when @xmath93 the unidimensional oscillator mucs is re - obtained .",
    "a detailed analysis of wigner oscillator coherent states is in preparation .    to complete our analysis on coherent states for the calogero interaction , we trace below the construction of minimum uncertainty coherent states .",
    "now let us consider new definitions of the position @xmath94 and momentum @xmath95 so that    @xmath96    which leads us to the following commutation relation    @xmath97=4ih_-.\\ ] ]    in this case the minimum uncertainty states @xmath98 with equal dispersions for @xmath94 and @xmath99 are given by    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is an eigenstate particular set of @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , using the two identities    @xmath103    we obtain the following expectation values in the ccs :    @xmath104 ^ 2 + 2<h_- >   \\nonumber\\\\ < { \\hat p}^2>&&=2[im(\\alpha)]^2 + 2<h_->,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where",
    "@xmath105    the variances of position operator @xmath106 and momentum operator @xmath107 on the coherent states @xmath108 are identical .",

    "( [ ebe ] ) , for @xmath110 is given by    @xmath111    thus , from eq .",
    "( [ evxp ] ) the minimum uncertainty relation for @xmath112 @xmath113 and @xmath114 respectively , becomes    @xmath115    indeed , we find that the variances in new position and momentum satisfy    @xmath116    therefore , we show that a calogero interaction in ccs leads us to minimum uncertainty relation . in figures",
    "i , ii and iii we plot @xmath117 and @xmath118 for two particular values of @xmath119",
    "we have presented the canonical coherent states ( ccs ) associated with the unidimensional harmonic oscillator plus a centripetal barrier ( a calogero interaction @xcite with two particles for the relative coordinate @xmath120 or isotonic oscillator @xcite ) , which preserve the property of non - orthogonality .",
    "these ccs were deduced via r - deformed heisenberg ( or wigner - heisenberg ) algebra in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "although we have mainly treated the calogero interaction ccs , similar results can be adequately extracted for any physical d - dimensional radial oscillator system by the hermitian replacement of @xmath121 and the wigner deformation parameter @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the d - dimensional oscillator angular momentum . in tridimensional space",
    "this hermitian replacement left us exactly to the potential first investigated by davidson in the beginning of thirties @xcite .",
    "therefore we can construct new spherical coherent states for diatomic molecules with davidson interaction @xcite , so that complete diatomic molecule energy spectra and eigenfunctions can be deduced algebraically via r - deformed heisenberg algebra or wigner - heisenberg factorization method @xcite .",
    "we also consider a succinct anylis of the construction of minimum uncertainty coherent states ( mucs ) for the wigner oscillator position @xmath124 and momentum @xmath87 and a detailed anylis of minimum uncertainty coherent states for the calogero interaction .",
    "let us point out that a ccs @xmath125 is an eigenstate of the wigner annihilation operator according to eq .",
    "( [ wcs ] ) , it is possible to show that the analogous of so called even and odd ccs @xmath126 , which appear in the coherent states for the usual harmonic oscillator and quantum optics for uncharged quanta@xcite and charge quanta @xcite , are eigenstates of the operator @xmath127 ( but not of @xmath128 a detailed analysis of the generation of even and odd canonical coherent states via r - deformed heisenberg algebra will be published elsewhere .",
    "recently alexanian _",
    "et al . _ have built a star product associated with an arbitrary two - dimensional poisson structure using generalized coherent states on the complex plane @xcite .",
    "the coherent states for the isotonic oscillator has been considered in the coordinate representation by bagchi and bhaumik @xcite .",
    "the correspondence between eigenvalue eqs .",
    "( 26 ) in ref . @xcite and our eq .",
    "( [ eea ] ) provided us @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the eigenvalue in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "@xmath132 thus , following @xcite , under the context of mesoscopic physics , in the case of @xmath4-boson or fermion hamiltonian we can obtain the relation between the brownian motion and calogero model .",
    "for instance in our case with two particles the choice @xmath133 gives us @xmath134 belonging to the even sector of @xmath135 these aspects will be considered elsewhere in construction of the supercoherent states @xcite for diatomic molecules @xcite .",
    "however , note that in this work the @xmath136 operators become      therefore , the present work opens a new route for future investigations on the calogero interaction coherent states , for instance let us point out that the r - deformed heisenberg ( or wigner - heisenberg ) algebra can be applied for a complete spectral resolution of the complex calogero model with real energies @xcite , too .",
    "finally , let us point out that one can consider an analysis of the calogero interaction coherent states as reported in the works of references @xcite .",
