    "the kinetics of the growth of ordered phases after a quench from a disordered state continues to provide interesting physical questions . while the process is reasonably well understood for the case of binary mixtures , where dynamical scaling occurs and domains grow with power - law behavior @xcite , basic questions remain to be clarified for more complex systems @xcite . in this letter",
    "we consider the case of fluid mixtures where , due to competing interactions , the system would arrange itself in stripes .",
    "examples are di - block copolymer melts , where chains of type a and b , covalently bonded end - to - end in pairs , segregate at low temperatures in regions separated by a stack of lamellae @xcite , or ternary mixtures where surfactant form interfaces between oil and water @xcite . other systems with lamellar order are smectic liquid crystals @xcite , dipolar @xcite and supercooled liquids @xcite , chemically reactive binary mixtures @xcite .",
    "lamellar patterns are also observed in raleigh - bnard cells above the convective threshold @xcite .",
    "the ordering of lamellar systems is characterized by the presence of frustration on large scales .",
    "this affects the late time evolution which , as discussed below , can be very slow or also frozen .",
    "relations with the dynamics of structural glasses have been also considered in recent literature @xcite .",
    "one can expect that in real systems the effects of the velocity field , inducing motion around local or extended defects , can be relevant .",
    "our purpose here is to analyze the process of lamellar ordering taking into account the effects of hydrodynamics .",
    "we consider a model based on a ginzburg - landau free - energy , where dynamics is described by convection - diffusion and navier - stokes equations @xcite .",
    "our results for two - dimensional systems show that , when hydrodynamical modes are effective ( at sufficiently low viscosities ) , dynamical scaling holds with a complex dependence of characteristic lengths on time , analogous to that of systems with quenched disorder @xcite not present here .",
    "an intermediate faster growth is followed by a slower logarithmic evolution at later times .",
    "the slowing - down of the dynamics is attributed to the formation of extended defects between domains of lamellae with different orientation , almost perpendicular each other .",
    "our simulations show that the same phenomenon occurs in three - dimensional systems .",
    "these results are not expected to depend on the specific model considered and could be relevant for a broad class of systems with lamellar order .",
    "we also verified that applied shear flows alleviate frustration giving power - law growth at all times .",
    "we consider the free - energy model @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the order parameter field representing the local concentration difference between the two components of the mixture .",
    "the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 have to be positive in order to ensure stability . for @xmath8 and @xmath9 the two homogeneous phases with @xmath10 coexist .",
    "a negative @xmath11 favors the presence of interfaces and a transition into a lamellar phase can occur . in single mode approximation , assuming a profile like @xmath12 for the direction transversal to the lamellae , one finds the transition ( @xmath13 ) at @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the expression ( 1 ) can be also written for negative @xmath11 as @xmath17\\}$ ] , @xmath18 , and in this form is generally used to describe di - block copolymers in the weak segregation limit@xcite .",
    "the dynamical equations are @xcite @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the components of the velocity field , @xmath22 is the total density of the mixture and the incompressibility condition @xmath23 is considered .",
    "@xmath24 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath25 is a mobility coefficient .",
    "the pressure tensor is the sum of the usual hydrodynamical part and of a tensor @xmath26 depending on @xmath27 , with a functional form obtainable from the free energy containing off - diagonal terms , whose expression can be found in @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath28 implies @xmath29 .",
    "the laplacian in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ motion2 ] ) ensures the conservation of the order parameter .",
    "we will simulate these equations by using a finite difference scheme for the convection - diffusion equation and a lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) for the navier - stokes equation .",
    "advantages of this method @xcite with respect to other lbm schemes for fluid mixtures are that spurious terms appearing in eq.(3 ) @xcite are avoided and the numerical efficiency is increased . in @xmath30",
    "we used a parallel version of the lbm code which _ fuses _ the streaming and the collision processes to reduce bandwidth requirements @xcite .",
    "1fig .  2    -0.5 cm    we can summarize now what is known on the ordering properties of lamellar fluids .",
    "previous two - dimensional studies of the full model ( 1 - 3 ) @xcite , without quantitative analysis due to the small size of the lattice considered ( @xmath31 ) , showed the relevance of hydrodynamics for obtaining well ordered domains on the scale of the system simulated .",
    "more results exist for variants of the model ( 1 ) with long - range interactions , without hydrodynamics @xcite or neglecting the inertial terms of the l.h.s . of eq.(2 )",
    "eq.(3 ) without advection and with non - conserved order parameter , corresponding to the swift - hohenberg model for raleigh - bnard convection @xcite , has been also largely studied .",
    "regimes with dynamical scaling have been found with the order parameter structure factor behaving as @xmath32 $ ] with different values for the exponent @xmath33 , @xmath34 being the fourier transform of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "slower evolution with frozen states and grain boundary pinning has been also observed @xcite for very deep quenches . in @xmath30",
    "the few existing simulations have not considered dynamical scaling @xcite .",
    "we run our two - dimensional simulations on a @xmath36 lattice starting from disordered configurations .",
    "we fixed @xmath37 so that the minimum of the potential part of the free - energy is at @xmath38 .",
    "we checked on small systems ( @xmath31 ) for different @xmath39 in the lamellar phase that the expected equilibrium state was reached .",
    "the value of @xmath40 was fixed in such a way that the period is about 10 times the lattice spacing and @xmath41 for the cases presented .",
    "details on the lbm part of the code can be found in @xcite .",
    "after the quench , lamellae start to form evolving until the equilibrium wavelength is locally reached .",
    "this part of the ordering process does not depend on the value of viscosity .",
    "later , however , the system continues to order only at sufficiently low viscosities ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "otherwise , local defects dominate @xcite and , at times of order @xmath43 , the system results frozen in tangled configurations .",
    "an example of evolution at low viscosity ( @xmath44 ) is shown in fig.1 .",
    "different kinds of defects can be observed .",
    "the annihilation of a couple of dislocations is put in evidence .",
    "we have measured the relative velocity of the dislocations and we found it constant . at the last time of the figure",
    "the system can be observed to be ordered on larger scales .",
    "a quantitative description of the ordering process comes from the analysis of the structure factor @xmath45 . after",
    "spherical average we plotted @xmath46 at different times . in the early regime , with @xmath47",
    ", @xmath46 develops a maximum at a momentum @xmath2 which decreases with time until the equilibrium value @xmath48 is reached .",
    "then the peak of @xmath46 , remaining at @xmath48 , continues to grow while the width decreases indicating an increase of order in the system .",
    "a characteristic length @xmath3 for this process can be extracted from the structure factor in the usual way by measuring the full width @xmath49 of @xmath1 at half maximum and defining @xmath50 . in the inset of fig.2 we plotted @xmath51 on log - log scale , calculated by averaging over 5 different runs . for more than one decade",
    "a behavior consistent with the power - law @xmath52 can be observed with @xmath53 . the growth becomes slower at later times and we find @xmath54 as the straight line in the main frame of fig.2 suggests .",
    "we checked that the slowing down can not be attributed to finite size effects ( at the latest times considered , @xmath51 is less than 1/10 of the size of the system ) .",
    "4    -0.5 cm    the behavior of @xmath3 can be related to the role played in late time dynamics by extended defects ( grain boundaries ) between domains of differently oriented lamellae .",
    "a decrease in the growing rate of @xmath3 was observed at times @xmath55 when the average value of the angle between the normals of neighboring domains becomes close to @xmath56 .",
    "isolated grain boundaries can be shown to be stable defects in lamellar systems described by eq.([eqn1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "a quantitative description of ordering in lamellar systems can be obtained by considering the evolution equation for a single defect .",
    "the position @xmath57 of the grain boundary evolves according to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the curvature of lamellae parallel to the boundary and @xmath60 are model - dependent parameters @xcite .",
    "if one assumes that dynamical scaling is verified , a typical length can be defined as the inverse of curvature , and the previous equation implies a growth like @xmath61 until a critical value for curvature is reached .",
    "this analysis , elaborated for one single defect , suggests that in the ordering of a large system , in absence of other processes and without hydrodynamics , defects will become pinned at a certain time with the system frozen in a configuration with many grain boundaries . in our case the velocity field helps the system in continuing the ordering process also at very late times but slower . we measured @xmath62 which is the growth expected for systems with metastable states .",
    "an extension of the analytical arguments of @xcite in presence of hydrodynamics is not available .",
    "however , it is interesting to observe that our simulations suggest an intermediate regime with a power law consistent with that of @xcite followed by a logarithmic asymptotic growth , both results explainable as due to grain boundary dynamics .",
    "we also considered three dimensional systems .",
    "simulations ranging from @xmath63 to @xmath64 lattices were performed : the largest grid asked for about 20 days of sustained computations , using a 8-cpu vector machine nec sx6 and more than 32 gb of memory . while complete order was reached on @xmath63 lattices , larger systems confirm the role of grain boundaries in lamellar ordering .",
    "an example is given in fig.3 where a single grain boundary is shown : after @xmath65 no clear 2d ordering was observed .",
    "on the @xmath64 lattice we studied the behavior of @xmath51 , defined as in @xmath66 .",
    "after the formation of lamellae , the intermediate and late time regimes were found shorter and it was not possible to deduce quantitative behaviors",
    ". however , the role of grain boundaries can be appreciated looking for example at the configurations of fig.4 . here",
    "the central horizontal sections of the system at @xmath67 and @xmath68 are shown .",
    "many grain boundaries with three main orientations can be seen .",
    "after @xmath69 , in correspondence of a sudden decrease observed in the growing rate of @xmath51 , the further evolution of the system proceeds through the distortion of the grain boundaries existing at that time . this can be seen for example in the central bottom part of the configuration at @xmath68 .",
    "different domains , trying to increase their size , push themselves reciprocally , helped by the velocity field .",
    "this gives an unexpected late - time increase of curvature , also observed in @xmath66 .",
    "the role of hydrodynamics is important in this process : the system can reach a higher degree of order only by developing a strong velocity field which bends the existing flat grain boundaries .",
    "this will eventually bring later to a configuration with less defects .",
    "this picture is confirmed by the increase of kinetic energy observed at @xmath70 .",
    "in order to analyze dynamical scaling , together with @xmath51 , we also considered the behavior of the peak @xmath71 of the structure factor . in two - dimensional simulations , from fig.2 , one sees that @xmath72 grows similarly to @xmath51 but with a different rate .",
    "this suggests to consider scaling behavior in the general form @xmath73 $ ] @xcite .",
    "this differs from the usual expression considered in lamellar ordering ( @xmath74 $ ] ) for the introduction of @xmath75 and the use of @xmath3 even if not given by a power law .",
    "as illustrated in the inset of fig.5 , we evaluated @xmath76 .",
    "then , by using this value , we found , as shown in fig.5 , that rescaled structure factors overlap _ at all times _ after @xmath77 on a single curve , confirming our scaling assumption and suggesting an analogy with kinetic behavior in systems with quenched disorder . in random field ising models",
    "( rfim ) , for example , diffusive growth changes over to logarithmic behavior but dynamical scaling holds at all times with the same scaling function as in standard ising model @xcite . here",
    "a similar scenario occurs but without quenched disorder .",
    "this is interesting also in relation with the existence of an equilibrium glass transition in systems with lamellar order @xcite .",
    "5fig .  6    -0.5",
    "cm    concerning the exponent @xmath75 , its value is related to the compactness of domains and is @xmath78 in asymptotic growth of binary mixtures , @xmath79 in early time regime when interfaces are forming @xcite .",
    "our results with @xmath80 show that the argument for @xmath81 based on the existence of one scaling dimension for @xmath82 lamellar systems @xcite does not hold in presence of hydrodynamics .",
    "we found dynamical scaling also in 3d simulations but for a shorter time interval .",
    "we also studied lamellar ordering in presence of shear flow .",
    "shear was applied with bounce - back conditions on rigid walls moving with velocity @xmath83 at the top and bottom of the simulation volume @xcite .",
    "ordering is favored since interfaces want to orientate with the flow @xcite .",
    "breaking and recombination of domains , induced by shear , makes the elimination of topological defects faster @xcite . as a result ,",
    "logarithmic growth disappears and ordering occurs also asymptotically with power - law behavior even in cases , at high viscosity , where without shear freezing would have been observed .",
    "an example of this behavior ( @xmath84 ) is shown in fig.6 .",
    "growth was measured by the quantities @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "@xmath87 grows with exponent @xmath88 while @xmath89 relaxes to the equilibrium value .",
    "similar results were found for other values of @xmath24 ; a detailed exposition of our results with shear will appear elsewhere .",
    "to conclude , we have studied lamellar ordering in fluid mixtures with competitive interactions . at low viscosities ,",
    "when hydrodynamic modes are effective , dynamical scaling holds in the form @xmath90 $ ] where @xmath3 is a characteristic length with complex behavior and logarithmic growth at late times .",
    "this scaling , similar to that found in systems with quenched disorder , is shown here for the first time in 2d systems with lamellar order .",
    "3d simulations also show the relevance of grain boundaries defects for this dynamics .",
    "shear flow removes extended defects giving power - law behavior at all times .",
