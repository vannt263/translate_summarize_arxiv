    "the model emerges from the reduction of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum hall ( qh ) system to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain , with @xmath6 as the quasi - momentum transverse to the chain.@xcite when the potential is made @xmath7 by setting @xmath8 to an irrational number , the model has a localization transition @xcite : all bulk eigenstates are extended for @xmath9 , and localized for @xmath10 .",
    "the relationship between quasiperiodicity and localization has been explored in many subsequent variants of the model .",
    "typically , altering the potential modulation leads to starkly different behaviors ; some models exhibit mobility edges @xcite , while others lack any localization transition.@xcite one important variant , which preserves the critical properties of the original aah model , involves incommensurate modulations in the off - diagonal hopping coefficients.@xcite in this case , all states are localized for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the amplitude of the off - diagonal modulation.@xcite    recently , the aah model has attracted renewed attention @xcite , due to the realization that it can be implemented experimentally and used to study the topological properties of 2d bandstructures . in a pioneering paper , kraus _",
    "et al . _  demonstrated that an array of coupled optical waveguides can be used to realize a quasiperiodic aah model with purely off - diagonal couplings , and that it is possible to implement a `` topological pump '' which adiabatically transfers boundary states across the array by winding the phase of the coupling modulations.@xcite interestingly , it has been shown that aah models with on - site and/or off - diagonal modulation can be regarded as topologically equivalent to fibonacci lattices of the same quasiperiodicity.@xcite madsen _ et al .",
    "_  have pointed out , however , that the boundary states occurring in these 1d lattices are not limited to the quasiperiodic case ; they also appear in commensurate aah models , and in both cases they can be explained by dimensional reduction from a topologically non - trivial 2d system.@xcite for example , similar boundary states occur in the period-3 aah model @xcite , and in the period-2 model the boundary states have majorana - like characteristics.@xcite however , incommensurate and commensurate aah models do significantly differ in their localization properties .",
    "this paper describes a generalization of the aah model containing a tunable phase difference @xmath13 between the on - site and off - diagonal modulations .",

    "as we shall see , the generalized aah model has several new and interesting behaviors which have not previously been explored .",
    "firstly , in incommensurate lattices , a transition between purely extended and purely localized bulk states can be induced by varying @xmath13 , keeping the modulation amplitudes fixed . by contrast , in the original aah model , localization can only be induced by varying the modulation amplitudes . using a gauge argument",

    "however , when we use the _ relative _ phase @xmath13 as the pumping parameter , both types of bandgap can be observed for different parameter regimes .",
    "this allows us to propose a scheme for observing topological `` phase transitions '' using a family of 1d aah models .",
