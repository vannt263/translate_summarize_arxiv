    "low - lying quadrupole oscillations in nuclei have been studied extensively with all kinds of nuclear structure models . among the more popular are the geometrical model@xcite and the interacting boson model ( ibm)@xcite .",
    "although rather different in their microscopic interpretation and formulation , both of them have been extremely successful in describing low - lying energy levels associated to quadrupole oscillations . in three different situations",
    "both models provide analytical results that can be identified in the geometrical model as those corresponding to spherical@xcite , well quadrupole deformed @xcite and deformed @xmath0-unstable shapes@xcite .",
    "the corresponding situations occur in ibm for the u(5)@xcite , su(3)@xcite and o(6)@xcite limits respectively .",
    "connection between both models has been established by exploring the geometrical content of the ibm by using coherent states @xcite .",
    "high - lying dipole states are studied in the context of the geometrical model by using the dynamic collective model within the hydrodynamical approach@xcite . in the ibm context",
    "these states can be studied with the so called dipole boson model @xcite , which includes a dipole @xmath1 boson into the usual ibm space ( quadrupole @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons ) .",
    "the connection between both approaches , especially for the case of well deformed nuclei , has already been discussed@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in studying the coupling of the dipole mode to a @xmath0-unstable quadrupole form .",
    "the results of the geometrical model will be presented and the study within the dipole boson model will be performed both in the laboratory frame and in the intrinsic frame projecting afterwards onto the laboratory frame .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "the coupling of the dipole mode to a @xmath0-unstable rotor is analysed within the geometrical model . in section 3 the coupling of the dipole mode to an o(6 ) quadrupole deformed nuclei is investigated in the interacting boson model .",
    "this is done in two steps , first we study the problem in the intrinsic frame and then the projection to the laboratory frame is performed .",
    "comparisons of exact results and those obtained in the intrinsic frame plus projection for different sets of parameters are presented and discussed . in section 4",
    "examples of calculations for photonuclear cross - section are presented , and the different approximations compared .",
    "finally , in section 5 the paper is summarised and the main conclusions assessed .",
    "the interaction between dipole and quadrupole oscillations has been studied in the geometrical model .",
    "the coupling to the quadrupole degree of freedom splits the energy of the dipole mode , and within the linear coupling in the quadrupole amplitude@xcite the energies of the three resulting dipole resonances as seen from the intrinsic frame are @xmath4~~ ; ~~\\mu=-1,0,1~~,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the unperturbed dipole energy , @xmath6 is the restoring force parameter , and @xmath7 is the dipole  quadrupole coupling coefficient . a plot of these energies with respect to the unperturbed value @xmath5 is given in fig .",
    "1 as a function of the asymmetry parameter @xmath0 , for a fixed value of the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath8    a detailed structure of the dipole absorption line can be obtained from a numerical diagonalization of the coupled dipole ",
    "quadrupole hamiltonian . a simple model in the strong coupling approximation for extracting the dipole strength distribution from the intrinsic values is provided by the procedure of averaging the three contributions over the different quadrupole @xmath8 and @xmath0 deformations , according to the ground state distribution .",
    "the relative strength of the dipole transition probability @xmath9 per unit of energy is in this way proportional to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the wave function of the ground state resulting from the quadrupole energy surface .",
    "the specific case of @xmath0-unstable rotor occurs when the intrinsic energy surface is isotropic in the @xmath0 variable , while displaying a sharp minimum for deformation @xmath12 . assuming the extreme situation of a very sharp minimum",
    ", we can in first approximation keep fixed the value of @xmath12 and only average over the @xmath0 variable . in this adiabatic picture",
    "one obtains the probability distribution shown in fig .",
    "2 . the distribution is symmetric around @xmath5 , with three maxima , two at the edges ( at energies @xmath13 ) and one in the center ( at energy @xmath5 ) , with @xmath14 and with zeros occurring at energies @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting total splitting @xmath16 is therefore directly proportional to the quadrupole deformation @xmath12 , as in the case of a static quadrupole deformation .",
    "note that although the probability at the edges is 3 times the one at the center , the total probability is anyway exactly equally divided into the three bumps .",
    "it may be worth noticing that , aside from the broadening of the three peaks , the predicted situation in the @xmath0-unstable case is actually rather similar to the prediction associated with a static quadrupole deformed system with @xmath0 equal to 30 degrees .",
    "this similarity of the two situations is a feature that also appears for other observables and has been discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "to include the dipole degrees of freedom in the usual ibm , one negative parity dipole @xmath1boson ( @xmath17 ) has to be included in addition to the positive parity quadrupole @xmath2 ( @xmath18 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath19 ) bosons . for a boson system with @xmath20 quadrupole bosons plus @xmath21 dipole boson ,",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the usual ibm hamiltonian for quadrupole degrees of freedom , @xmath24 is the dipole hamiltonian given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the interaction between quadrupole and dipole degrees of freedom .",
    "the operator @xmath27 is the @xmath1-boson number operator , which in this case is @xmath28 or @xmath21 , and @xmath5 is the unperturbed dipole energy . for the interaction a simple quadrupole - quadrupole form",
    "is assumed @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the usual ibm quadrupole operator @xmath31 and @xmath32 the operators @xmath33 ( where @xmath0 stands for @xmath2 , @xmath3 or @xmath1 bosons ) are introduced so as to have operators with the appropriate properties under spatial rotations .",
    "the simplest form for the dipole operator is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an overall normalization parameter , which will be assumed equal to unity in the applications .",
    "first the laboratory ibm calculation is presented .",
    "the quadrupole @xmath36 hamiltonian for the o(6 ) limit can be written in the form @xmath37= b ~ c_2[o(5 ) ] + c ~ c_2[o(3 ) ] + d ~ c_2[o(6 ) ] \\label{hamo6}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 stands for the quadratic casimir operator of the indicated algebra as defined in ref .",
    "energies associated with this @xmath36 hamiltonian can be obtained analytically to be @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the labels of the irreducible representations of the algebras o(6 ) , o(5 ) and o(3 ) respectively .",
    "the coupling to the dipole oscillations and the calculation of transition probabilities is done numerically by using the computer codes gdr and gdrt , respectively @xcite .",
    "the states belonging to the @xmath43 representation are favoured in energy and the relative position of the states belonging to other representations is governed by the parameter @xmath3 . in the o(6 ) limit these representations are not connected by the quadrupole @xmath44 operator if @xmath45 is taken in eq .",
    "( [ quadrb ] ) , and they therefore remain unmixed ( and characterized by a good value of @xmath40 ) also with the inclusion of the dipole - quadrupole coupling . consequently the dipole operator will only connect the ground state with states of the @xmath43 representation , which will therefore be the only ones contributing to the @xmath46 distribution .",
    "this implies that , as far as the dipole distribution is concerned , the calculation is completely insensitive to the value of the parameter @xmath3 . for the other parameters , in order to favour the comparison with preceding results obtained within the simple scheme based on the geometrical model , the parameter @xmath47 has been put equal to zero in order to minimize the splitting due to the angular momentum , a feature not accounted for by the unprojected intrinsic state .",
    "the results obtained for the energies of dipole states and the corresponding @xmath46 are shown in fig .",
    "3 ( left panels ) for different values of the parameter @xmath48 in front of the o(5 ) casimir operator . at variance with the previous distribution displayed in fig .",
    "2 we have now a discrete distribution due to the finite number of bosons and consequently finite number of states .",
    "note that the pure su(3 ) limit with @xmath49 gives a dipole strength distribution with only two lines , since only two @xmath50 states can be obtained by coupling the dipole boson with the ground state rotational band . in the o(6 ) limit there are instead @xmath51 @xmath50 states connected to the ground state by the dipole operator , namely all those originated by the @xmath52 and @xmath53 states appearing in the @xmath54 band .",
    "we can however compare the envelope of this discrete distribution with the continuous distribution given by the geometrical model in its simplest adiabatic version . in order to facilitate comparisons an appropriate discretization of fig . 2 for the case of n=15 bosons , an unperturbed dipole energy @xmath5 = 15 mev , and a dipole - quadrupole coupling @xmath55=0.2 mev ( same parameters as in fig .",
    "3 ) is presented in fig .",
    "4 . in the limit of very small values of @xmath48 , namely in strong - coupling situations ,",
    "the splitting due to the different values of @xmath41 within each o(6 ) representation is small compared to the coupling . as a consequence the patterns obtained in figs .",
    "3 and 4 are similar , since the mixing between the different states induced by the quadrupole - dipole interaction is large . at the other extreme",
    ", for values of @xmath48 large with respect to the dipole - quadrupole coupling the pattern observed in fig .",
    "3 becomes very asymmetric , tending to concentrate the transition strength onto the lowest state , washing out any resemblance with the one obtained in the geometrical model , fig .",
    "4 , and giving rise to a situation close to the pure spherical case .",
    "in fact in this weak - coupling limit , because of the large @xmath41 splitting , only the lowest @xmath50 states have large overlaps with the initial s  d ground state .    for a better understanding of the situation we will study next the problem within the intrinsic frame in the ibm .",
    "let us now study the problem of the coupling of quadrupole and dipole degrees of freedom in the intrinsic frame , within the ibm description .",
    "the basic idea of the intrinsic - frame formalism in this case is to consider that the pure quadrupole states of the ground `` band '' are globally described by a boson condensate of the form @xmath56 where the basic boson is given by @xmath57~~ , \\label{ground2}\\ ] ] @xmath8 and @xmath0 being obtained by minimizing the energy surface . in the case of su(3 ) one has @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and the intrinsic state is fully representative of the ground - state rotational band . in the case of o(6 ) , instead , one has @xmath60 , and the intrinsic state , which gives rise to a @xmath0-independent energy surface , is associated with all states of the `` band '' corresponding to the @xmath43 representation . for the dipole part , the corresponding building blocks are @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the three states @xmath64 provide with an intrinsic basis where the dipole - quadrupole states can be studied . in this basis , the pure @xmath44 and @xmath1 parts of the hamiltonian are diagonal and the only non - diagonal contributions come from the interaction term .",
    "the matrix elements needed in order @xmath65 are @xmath66 where @xmath67 have already been calculated @xcite , @xmath68~ , \\label{qsd1}\\ ] ] @xmath69~~. \\label{qsd2}\\ ] ] the @xmath30 matrix elements not specified are zero .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath70 can be easily computed to be @xmath71 all the remaining relevant matrix elements for our study are zero .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 is the structure constant in the quadrupole operator @xmath30 .",
    "the su(3 ) case ( studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is obtained for @xmath73 and the o(6 ) limit corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "the dipole energies are obtained by diagonalising the interaction @xmath26 in the basis @xmath64 .",

    ", corresponding to the su(3 ) limit , eqs .",
    "( [ enerp1 ] ) become equivalent to eqs .",
    "( 9b ) in ref .",
    "@xcite with terms linear and quadratic in @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding energies are shown in fig .",
    "the o(6 ) limit corresponds instead to @xmath45 . in this case",
    "( [ enerp1 ] ) have only a linear term in @xmath8 , and the corresponding energies are shown in fig .",
    "these latter energies are equal to those obtained in the preceding section for the geometrical model , once the correspondence is made between deformation parameters and coupling strengths in the two models , such that    @xmath76    as in the case of the geometrical model , a simple way of obtaining the dipole strength distribution from the ibm intrinsic state is to average the intrinsic energies over @xmath0 . in analogy to the intrinsic energies , the resulting distribution will show , _ mutatis mutandis _",
    ", a pattern identical to the one shown in fig . 2 for the geometrical model .",
    "we have seen so far that the straightforward use of the intrinsic state in the ibm without any projection technique gives results similar to the ones obtained in the geometrical model .",
    "these results are consistent with those obtained in the laboratory frame only for boson hamiltonians that give rise to splittings in the elements of each o(6 ) multiplet which are much smaller than the splitting due to the dipole - quadrupole coupling . in all other more general cases , the effect of the breaking of degeneracy of each multiplet is essential , and proper treatment of the projection to the laboratory system from the intrinsic state is needed .    in this subsection",
    "it is therefore shown how to project the intrinsic state for the ground - state representation @xmath43 into the @xmath41 component . with this",
    "we would like to show that the calculations in the intrinsic frame , after projecting after on @xmath41 , reproduce the laboratory results .",
    "in the o(6 ) case the projector is known @xcite , and the important feature is that it produces exactly the laboratory states @xmath77 , belonging to the representation @xmath43 .",
    "we have considered states of the form @xmath77 coupled to @xmath78 to total @xmath79 .",
    "the states @xmath77 are obtained by applying the projector @xmath80 ( bs functions @xcite ) to the intrinsic ground state @xmath81 as given in eqs .",
    "( [ ground1],[ground2 ] ) . for each value of @xmath41",
    "there is only one state ( either @xmath82 or @xmath83 ) to be considered .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath20 there will be @xmath84 dipole states .    in order to diagonalize the hamiltonian in the @xmath79 subspace",
    ", we have included diagonal ( trivial ) and non  diagonal terms .",
    "for the latter ones we have used the results of the matrix elements of the interaction @xmath85 in the intrinsic frame ( [ qqdef]-[qp ] ) and made the appropriate integrations on @xmath0 and the euler angles @xmath86 to go from the intrinsic to the laboratory frame .",
    "the resulting matrix to be diagonalized in the lab connects states of the same @xmath41 ( diagonal terms ) and states of @xmath41 with @xmath87 as known .",
    "we have done full calculations up to @xmath88 for the case @xmath45 and found simple expressions for the non - diagonal matrix elements that allow calculations for any value of @xmath20 .",
    "these expressions are ( we will use the notation @xmath89 for the states , with the selection rule @xmath90  =  @xmath91 )    @xmath92    @xmath93    where @xmath94 .",
    "we have checked that these expressions coincide , in leading order in 1/n , with those associated with the corresponding `` exact '' states for @xmath95 and @xmath96 . with these matrix elements",
    "we have done a series of calculations and the resulting dipole @xmath97 distributions are compared in fig .",
    "3 ( right panels ) with the exact results in the laboratory frame for different values of @xmath48 . in fig .",
    "4 the corresponding distribution obtained from the unprojected intrinsic state ( equal for all values of @xmath48 ) is plotted for comparison . in all the cases",
    "we have fixed the number of bosons to 15 and the intensity of the quadrupole ( @xmath44)-quadrupole ( @xmath1 ) interaction to the value @xmath98 mev .",
    "we have changed the intensity of the @xmath99 term by acting on the @xmath48 term in eq .",

    "* \\i ) @xmath100 mev .",
    "this gives an excitation energy of the @xmath101 of 0.0012 mev , almost degenerate case .",
    "the pattern of the @xmath102 in the exact calculation @xcite ( left lowest panel ) is as mentioned before ( three maxima , two at the edges with @xmath102 about 3 times the value of the maximum at the center ) . in our projected calculation",
    "( right lowest panel ) we obtain similar pattern with three bumps but now the maxima at the edges are lower than in the full lab calculation and the maximum at the center is higher than the one in the exact calculation . in this way",
    "we obtain three maxima of roughly the same height .",
    "the two minima are more or less in the same places in both calculations .",
    "it is remarkable that the number of states in the projected calculation close to the edges is larger than in the full lab calculation and the number of states close to the center is smaller . in that way the summed @xmath102 values in each of the three bumps",
    "is the same in both calculations .",
    "the energy separation between edges is also about the same in both calculations . *",
    "\\ii ) @xmath103 mev .",
    "this gives an excitation energy of the @xmath101 of 0.012 mev .",
    "now the patterns are more similar in both calculations , the population of the lowest part being favoured in both cases .",
    "the results start to deviate appreciably from the unprojected ones .",
    "* \\iii ) @xmath104 mev .",
    "this gives an excitation energy of the @xmath101 of 0.120 mev .",
    "now the patterns of the laboratory and the projected intrinsic state are very close , with strong deviation from the pure results of the intrinsic state .",
    "* \\iv ) @xmath105 mev .",
    "this gives an excitation energy of the @xmath101 of 1.2 mev .",
    "now only the 3 - 4 lowest states are populated and energies and @xmath102 s are practically identical in both calculations .    from this comparison we conclude that our intrinsic calculation followed by projection on @xmath41 gives a good approximation to the laboratory results .",
    "it is worth noticing that in all cases the agreement is excellent except for the almost degenerate case , which is surprising since in that case the intrinsic state is expected to be a good approximation ( see fig .",
    "3 lowest left panel and fig .",
    "4 ) . this can be due either to the projection method or to the intrinsic trial wave function . in this case",
    "the projection method is known to be exact for the large @xmath20 limit , thus the problem must come from the trial wave function . as mentioned above , in the limit of very small values of @xmath48 ( strong - coupling situations )",
    "the splitting of the different values of @xmath41 within each o(6 ) representation is small compared to the coupling .",
    "consequently , the trial wave function proposed as @xmath64 with @xmath81 given by eqs .",
    "( [ ground1],[ground2 ] ) could be not completely appropriate in this case .",
    "the coupling to the additional dipole boson has in fact destroyed the full @xmath0-unstability of the system ( cf .",
    "5 ) , leading to an additional variation of the order of 1/@xmath20 in the basic boson of the condensate .",
    "the situation is similar to that obtained , for example , in the coupling of an odd particle to a su(3 ) boson core , where the additional particle slightly shiftes the position of the minimum of the energy surface in the @xmath8-@xmath0 plane .",
    "it should be noted that realistic cases of o(6 ) nuclei correspond to values of @xmath48 around @xmath106 mev , far from degeneration in @xmath41 . we have checked this by making a set of calculations for a fixed and reasonable value of @xmath48 and changing the interaction @xmath55 . in those cases agreement between laboratory calculations and intrinsic plus",
    "projection is fine for any reasonable value of @xmath55 . only for extremely large and unphysical values of @xmath55",
    "some discrepancies between both calculations start to appear .    once the energy spectra and the dipole transition strengths",
    "have been discussed we present in the next section the cross sections for absorption of unpolarized @xmath0 radiation in the gdr region .",
    "dipole strength distributions are traditionally measured in photoabsorption processes .",
    "although photoabsorption cross - sections directly reflect the dipole strength , some of the features associated with this strength may disappear , be masked or modified by the effect of the finite widths .",
    "for this reason , once the distribution of the individual dipole states has been analyzed in the preceding section , we prefer in this section to compare results obtained within the ibm dipole model in the laboratory frame , unprojected and projected intrinsic frame directly for photoabsorption cross - sections .",
    "the cross section for photoabsorption is in fact given by @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 are the widths of the dipole states at energy @xmath109 .",
    "the dipole widths are either taken as a constant or assumed to have a power law dependence on the energy , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the energy of the unperturbed dipole state and @xmath112 its width .",
    "both @xmath112 and @xmath113 are used as adjustable parameters when one is fitting experimental data .    in fig . 6",
    "we present the cross - sections obtained for the two extreme ( @xmath48=0.00015 mev and @xmath48=0.15 mev ) dipole strength distributions corresponding to fig .",
    "full lines give the results for the case @xmath48=0.00015 mev ( almost @xmath41-degenerate case ) while dashed lines are for @xmath48=0.15 mev . in both cases @xmath114 mev and the intensity of the quadrupole ( sd)-quadrupole ( p ) interaction ( @xmath55 ) is 0.2 mev .",
    "left panels give the laboratory results and right panels the intrinsic plus projection on @xmath41 results .",
    "we have done two sets of calculations which select different widths for the dipole states .",
    "upper panels correspond to the case in which the dipole widths are assumed to have a power law dependence on the energy .",
    "since we are not working with an specific nucleus , we have taken @xmath112= 0.026 @xmath115 ( mev ) and @xmath113=1.91 .",
    "these values come from one global parametrization of experimental photoabsorption cross sections for @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "that implies widths ranging from about 3.5 to 6.0 mev for @xmath109 ranging from 13 to 17 mev , respectively .",
    "lower panels represent equivalent cases but taking the dipole widths as a constant equal to 2.5 mev .",
    "first of all we should realize that the actual shape of the photoabsorption cross - section is very much dependent on the widths assumed .",
    "the dashed lines ( case with @xmath48=0.15 mev ) in all panels still reflect contributions from the two lower states since they are separated by about 3 mev .",
    "by contrast , all the states contribute to the almost @xmath41 degenerate case ( full lines , @xmath48=0.00015 mev ) since now the states differ by less than 0.5 mev .",
    "thus the image on the photoabsorption cross - section of the shape of the dipole strength distribution in fig .",
    "3 is diluted , even showing a plateau when we use the biggest widths ( upper panels ) .    in all the cases , independently of the election of @xmath48 and the dipole widths assumed ( either constant or energy dependent ) , a good agreement between the laboratory and @xmath41-projected intrinsic frame calculations",
    "is observed when comparing left and right panels , although as in fig . 3 as the absolute value of the ratio b/@xmath55 decreases its quality becomes a bit worse .",
    "it is worth noticing that the calculations for the case of unprojected geometrical adiabatic situation given in fig .",
    "4 are indistinguishable from those plotted with full line on the right - hand - side panels ( @xmath48=0.00015 mev ) as expected .",
    "we have studied the problem of the coupling of the quadrupole and dipole oscillations in @xmath0-unstable nuclei in the framework of the ibm . we have obtained and explained the results in the laboratory by studying the problem in the intrinsic frame taking at higher order the non - degeneracy in @xmath41 .    in the @xmath41-degenerate limit the dipole mode total splitting ( 2@xmath117 ) turns out to be proportional to the dipole - quadrupole coupling strength , the number of sd bosons considered , n , and the quadrupole deformation .",
    "furthermore , the dipole mode splits in n+1 lines and its distribution is symmetric around the unperturbed dipole energy .",
    "this symmetry is destroyed as soon as we allow non - degeneracy in @xmath41 , giving rise to a very asymmetric distribution . in the weak coupling limit",
    "the transition strength is concentrated onto the lowest states .",
    "since this limit seems to correspond to the actual situation in typical o(6 ) nuclei , @xmath118pt or @xmath119ba for instance , the explicit treatment of the non - degeneracy in @xmath41 is crucial . in this case",
    "the results from the geometrical model in the adiabatic limit are quite different from the dipole boson model ones . in this sense , the o(6 )",
    "limit is different to the su(3 ) case in which the rotational excitation energy is low and can be ignored in first approximation and , consequently , the geometrical model in the adiabatic limit gives an appropriate description .",
    "calculations of photoabsorption cross - sections using the intrinsic state in the ibm followed by projection on @xmath41 give a good approximation to the laboratory results .",
    "no experimental data on o(6 ) nuclei are available and they could be valuable to elucidate whether the dipole strength distribution in actual o(6 ) nuclei is in agreement with the @xmath41-projected dipole boson model results presented here .",
