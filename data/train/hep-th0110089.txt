    "recent cosmological observations based on the study of supernova @xcite and of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite suggest that soon after the big bang our universe experienced a stage of a very rapid accelerated expansion ( inflation ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , observations indicate that few billion years after the big bang the universe entered a second stage of accelerated expansion .",
    "the rate of acceleration now is many orders of magnitude smaller than during the stage of inflation in the early universe . for a discussion of the recent cosmological observations and their theoretical interpretation see e.g. @xcite .",
    "most of the inflationary models are based on the assumption that the energy - momentum tensor during inflation is dominated by potential energy density of a scalar field , @xmath7 with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this means , in particular , that @xmath9 .",
    "the limiting case @xmath10 corresponds to de sitter space with a positive cosmological constant .",
    "the current cosmological acceleration can be explained either by a positive vacuum energy @xmath0 ( cosmological constant ) or by a slowly rolling scalar field in a near de sitter background with @xmath9 ( quintessence ) @xcite .",
    "much of the recent progress in theory of all fundamental interactions is related to supersymmetry",
    ". therefore it would be very desirable to find de sitter or near - de sitter solutions in supersymmetric theories .",
    "in n=1 theories many choices are available and therefore the motivation for a particular choice has to come from a more fundamental theory , either directly from m / string theory in 11/10 dimensions or perhaps from an effective 4d theory with higher supersymmetry .",
    "this was recently discussed in the context of 4d n=2 supersymmetry in @xcite where a hybrid hypersymmetric model of inflation / acceleration was proposed . on the other hand",
    ", it may be difficult to obtain 4d de sitter space directly from m / string theory .",
    "the problems have been recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the basic problem seems to originate from the compactification of m / string theory on internal space with the finite volume .",
    "however , some 4d n=8,4,2 gauged supergravity theories are known to have de sitter solutions with spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry @xcite-@xcite",
    ". these versions of 4d supergravity are related to 11d supergravity with a non - compact internal 7d space @xcite .",
    "m - theory has some solutions with warped products of de sitter space with hyperbolic spaces and generalized cylinders , @xmath11 . for conceptual problems associated with non - compact internal space and attempts to overcome them we refer to @xcite and references therein .    here",
    "we will take a simple attitude to potentials of gauged supergravities : we will consider only 4d theories where all kinetic terms have correct sign and therefore these theories from the 4d perspective do not have any conceptual problems whatsoever .",
    "we will study the properties of their potentials with regard to cosmology .",
    "if we find any potentials interesting for cosmology , we may come back to the problems of accommodating these 4d supergravity models in the framework of m - theory with non - compact internal space .",
    "the physical motivation for our study of potentials of supergravity originates in cosmology . a standard _ slow - roll inflation _ resulting in many e - foldings and scale independence of the spectrum will be reviewed .",
    "a new concept of _ fast - roll inflation _ will be proposed .",
    "it is partially motivated by the properties of supergravity potentials and also by the present epoch acceleration with small number of e - foldings .",
    "we start with reminding some well known facts about the relation between de sitter space and expanding universe in section [ ds ] .",
    "section [ fast ] explains a standard _ slow - roll inflation _ and introduces a new concept of a _ fast - roll inflation_. this defines the properties of the potentials interesting for cosmology .",
    "in sections [ n=8 ] and [ n=4 ] we study the potentials of n=8 and n=4 , 2 gauged supergravities . in section [ flat ]",
    "we discuss some potentials of n=8 supergravity which have interesting minkowski vacua with flat directions .",
    "we discuss the main results and perspectives in conclusions .",
    "anti de sitter space was at full attention of high - energy physics community for the last 10 years from the time when it was realized that near horizon the geometry of stringy bps black holes and branes tends to anti de sitter space .",
    "it was known also for a very long time that the potentials of gauged supergravities have anti de sitter critical points which are at the top of the inverted potentials and correspond to the maximum of these potentials and the tachyons are present .",
    "still when the negative ( mass)@xmath12 is limited in a certain way corresponding to breitenlohner - freedman bound , the anti de sitter solution is stable . for @xmath13",
    "the bound is @xmath14 where @xmath15 defines the radius of the throat of the hyperboloid in the flat 5d space @xmath16 the hyperboloid in the 5d flat space defining de sitter space @xmath17 is x^2_0 -x^2_1-x^2_2 -x^2_3- x^2_4 = -h^-2  .",
    "[ desitter ] the difference between the two hyperboloids is that the right hand side has an opposite sign . besides , the @xmath18 hyperboloid has two ` time directions ' whereas @xmath19 one has only one ` time direction ' .",
    "the symmetry group for the @xmath18 hyperboloid is @xmath20 whereas for the @xmath19 hyperboloid it is @xmath21 .    to explain shortly the relation of de sitter space to cosmology we will first present here the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric describing the expanding friedmann universe : ds^2= dt^2- a^2(t ) , where @xmath22 for a closed , open or flat expanding friedmann universe , respectively . here",
    "@xmath23 is the time - dependent scale factor . for a spatially flat universe with @xmath24",
    "the metric can be represented in a form ds^2= dt^2- a^2(t)dx^2   .",
    "closed friedmann universe with @xmath25 can be represented in the form ds^2=",

    "finally , an open friedmann universe with @xmath26 can be represented in the form ds^2=",
    "dt^2- a^2(t )  , 0  .",
    "the relation between the metric of expanding universe and de sitter space is the following .",
    "first , one can consider the hyperboloid ( [ desitter ] ) in a coordinate system which spans the half of the hyperboloid with @xmath27 .",
    "the choice @xmath28 leads to the metric ds^2= dt^2- e^2htdx^2  .",
    "this is a frw spatially flat metric with the exponential scale factor @xmath29 .",
    "we may choose the coordinates which span the entire hyperboloid : @xmath30 @xmath31 which results in the metric ds^2= dt^2- h^-2 ^2 ht  , 02  .",
    "this is a frw metric of the closed friedmann universe with the exponential scale factor @xmath32 .",
    "an open friedmann universe appears from de sitter space if the coordinate system is chosen as follows : @xmath33 @xmath34 these coordinates do not cover the entire hyperboloid .",
    "the metric is ds^2= dt^2- h^-2 ^2",
    "ht  , 0  .",
    "this is a frw metric of the open friedmann universe with the exponential scale factor @xmath35 .",
    "de sitter space has a direct relation to inflationary cosmology @xcite , which we will briefly describe now .",
    "consider a theory of a scalar field @xmath36 with potential @xmath37 .",
    "the friedmann equation for the scale factor of the universe looks as follows : [ freed ] ( aa)^2 + ka^2 = ( ) 3 in units @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 for a closed , open or flat universe correspondingly , @xmath40 is the energy density of the scalar field .",
    "let us assume first that @xmath41 , and the field @xmath36 is constant and homogeneous , @xmath42",
    ". then ( aa)^2 + ka^2 = v3 .",
    "the solutions of this equation describe de sitter space with h = . note that at very large times @xmath43 all 3 types of de sitter metric for the flat , closed and open universe lead to the same exponential scale factor e^ht  , ht e^ht   , ht e^ht  . therefore we will concentrate on the simplest case of the flat universe with @xmath44 .",
    "flatness of the universe is a standard prediction of most of the inflationary models , where typically the term @xmath45 can be neglected as compared with @xmath46 after inflation @xcite .",
    "this means that inflationary theory predicts that our universe at present can not be in the anti - de sitter regime , because eq . ( [ freed ] )",
    "does not have any solutions for @xmath47 in the flat universe .",
    "de sitter space can describe late stages of the evolution of our universe if the universe has nonvanishing vacuum energy @xmath48 .",
    "however , in order to use de sitter - like stages for a description of inflation in the early universe one should find how de sitter stage ends and the usual hot friedmann universe emerges .",
    "one possibility is to study models where the potential @xmath37 has a very flat maximum , as in the new inflation scenario @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , the model where @xmath37 has a maximum at @xmath49 , such that in the vicinity of the maximum v ( ) = v_0 - m^2 ^ 22  .",
    "suppose that initially the field @xmath50 was homogeneous , small , and had small velocity , so that @xmath51",
    ". then the hubble constant @xmath52 practically did not change until the field rolled down to the point with @xmath53",
    ". therefore the universe continues expanding as @xmath54 until the field @xmath36 rolls from @xmath55 to _ 1 ~/m  .",
    "the motion of a homogeneous field @xmath36 is described by equation [ genequation ] + 3h= - v = m^2  .",
    "now let us assume that @xmath56 . in this case one can show that the field moves very slowly , so that one can neglect @xmath57 as compared to @xmath58 , and the growing solution for the field @xmath36 is given by @xmath59 this is the standard slow - roll solution for the scalar field during inflation .",
    "the slow - roll regime continues at least until the field rolls down below @xmath60 , i.e. during the time t = 3h m^2 .",
    "this leads to inflation by a factor of e^ht ~ ( _ 1_0)^3h^2/m^2 ~(_1_0)^v/|v|  .",
    "thus one can obtain an exponentially large degree of inflation for    conditions : @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the last condition is automatically satisfied at the top of the effective potential .",
    "the slow - roll conditions serve two purposes : they make the total expansion of the universe during the stage of inflation very large , @xmath63 , and they ensure that the spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations produced during inflation is almost scale - independent . these density perturbations are produced due to quantum effects during inflation @xcite ; they are playing a critical role in the subsequent process of formation of the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite . the deviation from scale - independence ( flatness ) of the spectrum",
    "is characterized by the factor @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "recent observations of anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation suggest that @xmath65 @xcite , which implies that |v|0.05 v  . if the perturbations that we observe were produced during inflation when the field @xmath36 was near the top of the potential .",
    "the slow - roll condition @xmath66 implies that @xmath67 , and , consequently , _ 1 1   in planck units ( i.e. @xmath68 ) .",
    "this is very similar to the standard requirement that appears in the simplest models of chaotic inflation with @xmath69 @xcite . to avoid this requirement and",
    "still have slow - roll inflation one would need to make the potential very flat at the top , and very curved near the minimum of the potential , as in the original version of the new inflation scenario @xcite , or as in the hybrid inflation scenario @xcite .",
    "one of the results of our paper is that the slow - roll condition @xmath70 is not satisfied near any of the extrema of the potentials with @xmath8 in n=8 gauged supergravity that have been studied in the literature .",
    "as we will show , in all of the models of n=8 gauged supergravity studied so far one has @xmath71 .",
    "thus , in all known cases these models do not support slow - roll i nflation near the extrema of the corresponding potentials .",
    "is it possible to have a _ fast - roll inflation _ with @xmath72 ? in our investigation of this question we have found , much to our own surprise , that the answer to this question is positive .    for simplicity we will consider first the limiting case @xmath73 . in this case",
    "one can neglect the term @xmath58 in the equation for the field @xmath36 .",
    "then the growing solution becomes = _ 0",
    "the duration of rolling from @xmath55 to @xmath60 is given by t = m^-1 .",
    "until the field rolls down to @xmath60 the energy density remains dominated by @xmath74 .",
    "this leads to inflation by a factor of [ expansion ] e^ht ~(_1_0)^h / m  . usually one does not expect the ratio @xmath75 to be exponentially large , and therefore one could think that for @xmath76 the duration of inflation of this kind must be rather insignificant .",
    "also , no long - wavelength perturbations of metric are generated in the regime @xmath77 by the standard inflationary mechanism .",
    "that is why the possibility of a fast - roll inflation with @xmath78 has not been thoroughly studied in the literature .",
    "meanwhile fast - roll inflation can be quite interesting , at least for a marginally fast - rolling regime with @xmath79 ( i.e. @xmath80 ) .",
    "this is the regime that we will often encounter in our investigation of extrema of the potentials in n=8 gauged supergravity .",
    "first of all , let us note that the initial value of the field @xmath36 can be quite small . formally , one may have @xmath81 . in this case the factor @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) can be indefinitely large . in reality , @xmath55 in this equation can not be taken much smaller than the level of quantum fluctuations with momenta @xmath82 , since such fluctuations also experience exponential growth , even in the absence of a homogeneous field @xmath55 : @xmath83 .",
    "a typical initial amplitude of all quantum fluctuations with @xmath84 participating in the exponential growth of the field @xmath36 can be estimated by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "a typical time it takes for this field to grow up to @xmath60 is given by @xcite [ constc ] t ~m^-1 .",
    "this leads to inflation by a factor of [ smallm1 ] e^ht ~(10_1m)^h / m  .    now that we have studied two limiting case , let us study a more general regime where @xmath3 and @xmath87 can be of the same order . to study this problem one should look for solutions of eq .",
    "( [ genequation ] ) in the form @xmath88 .",
    "this yields = i ( 3h2 ) .",
    "the solution with the sign - corresponds to the exponentially growing solution = _ 0 , where f(m^2/h^2 ) = - 32  .",
    "this immediately gives us the general result for the total expansion of the universe during inflation near the maximum of the potential : e^ht ~ ( _ 1_0)^1/f .",
    "one can easily check that this result coincides with our previously obtained results in the limiting cases @xmath89 and @xmath90 .    as an example , consider first the potentials with @xmath91 . in this case one",
    "has @xmath92 . in the theories with @xmath79",
    "one has @xmath93 , so for @xmath94 ( i.e. for the initial value of the field provided by quantum fluctuations @xcite ) one has [ smallm ] e^ht ~(10m_pm)^3.3  .",
    "clearly , this number can be quite significant .    to be more specific ,",
    "consider the possibility that such models can be responsible for the present stage of accelerated expansion of the universe with the hubble constant @xmath95 .",
    "then inflation in an unstable state close to the maximum of the potential in such a theory can lead to expansion of the universe by a factor that can be as large as e^ht ~(10 ^ 61)^3.3 ~10 ^ 200 ~e^460  .",
    "this is more than sufficient to explain the observed single e - folding of accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch .    meanwhile if one takes @xmath96 gev @xmath97 , which corresponds to the electroweak scale , one can obtain fast - roll inflation by a factor of e^ht ~(10 ^ 17)^3.3 ~10 ^ 56~e^130  .",
    "efficiency of fast - roll inflation rapidly decreases once one considers the regime with @xmath98 .",
    "an interesting example is provided by gauged n=8 supergravity , where , as we will see later , @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 . in terms of our potential @xmath101",
    "this implies that the point @xmath60 , which corresponds to @xmath102 , is given by @xmath103 . in dimensional units",
    "this is equivalent to having @xmath104 gev . in this model",
    "one has @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "then , for @xmath107 one finds e^ht ~(5   10 ^ 60)^0.73 ~10 ^ 44 ~e^100  .",
    "thus , fast - roll inflation in n=8 gauged supergravity may be responsible for up to 100 e - folds of exponential expansion of the universe with the hubble constant similar to its present value @xmath108 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath109 gev one has e^ht ~10 ^ 13 ~e^28  .    to give a different example , one may consider a simplest model of spontaneous symmetry breaking with the potential v ( ) = 4 ( ^2-v^2)^2 = -12 m^2 ^ 2 + m^2 4 v^2 ^4 + 14 m^2 v^2  , where @xmath110 , and @xmath111 corresponds to the minimum of @xmath37 with symmetry breaking .",
    "the hubble constant at @xmath49 in this model is given by @xmath112 , so that @xmath113 .",
    "fast - roll inflation in this model occurs for @xmath114 .",
    "assuming , e.g. , @xmath115 and @xmath116 gev , one finds @xmath117 , and e^ht ~(10 ^ 17)^1/f ~10 ^ 7  , whereas for @xmath118 , as in polonyi model , one has e^ht ~10",
    "^ 5  .    thus ,",
    "if in a certain class of theories one has @xmath119 , one should not immediately discard such theories as candidates for the description of an accelerated ( inflationary ) stage of the evolution of the universe .",
    "such theories can describe a prolonged stage of fast roll inflation if @xmath120 in planck units , see eqs .",
    "( [ smallm1 ] ) , ( [ smallm ] ) . for @xmath119 , the requirement",
    "@xmath121 is equivalent to the requirement that the extremum of the effective potential corresponds to the energy density much smaller than the planck density , @xmath122 .    a more detailed discussion of the fast - roll inflation will be contained in a separate publication @xcite .",

    "( [ phiphi ] ) we will get kinetic terms at the critical point : ^a _ a = - xx - yy . thus @xmath196 and @xmath197 are the fields over which we have to differentiate the potential .",
    "we find : m^2_xx & = & -4|g_1g_2    m^2_yy&=&-(g_1 ^ 2+g_2 ^ 2 + 2|g_1g_2 | ) .",
    "thus we see ( with account of normalization @xmath198 in @xcite ) that the tachyonic mass in the @xmath199 direction compares with the potential as in all previous cases : -m^2_p v_cr^= 2 v_cr  , m^2_tach= -12|r|  .",
    "however , the potential in @xmath200 direction has a tachyonic mass which looks quite independent of the value of the potential at the critical point .",

    "this is still puzzling , however here we have to remember that without looking at kinetic terms for vector fields , one can not make a definite judgement about the relation between @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "but this analysis was performed by zwiebach in @xcite and he concluded that effectively one has to consider only the case of @xmath202 for the de sitter solution .",
    "this case gives us @xmath203 .",
    "in fact the potential depends only on the combination @xmath204 and there is only one tachyon excitation and a flat direction .",
    "thus suggests that if we would perform the analysis of the kinetic terms for vector fields for the theory with @xmath205 we would find again that for canonical kinetic terms we do not have an extra tachyon field .",
    "another form of potential of n=4 theory was given in @xcite and has been recently discussed in @xcite : v = - ( 4g_1g_2 + ( g_1 ^ 2+g_2 ^ 2 ) + ( g_1 ^ 2-g_2 ^ 2 ) ) with @xmath206 for @xmath202 we get the potential discussed in @xcite @xmath207 with @xmath208 the critical point is @xmath209 and @xmath210 the presence of the parameter @xmath211 will not affect the properties of the system even though it seems that in this case @xmath212 and for very small @xmath211 it is possible to get @xmath213 the properties of the potential are related to canonical kinetic terms and the rescaling of the scalar field @xmath214 in the potential will also lead to the rescaling of the kinetic terms therefore we conclude that there is no free adjustable parameter which can be used for a slow - roll condition .",
    "the @xmath215 gauging of n=4 supergravity can be easily reduced to n=2 gauged supergravity with one vector multiplet gauging @xcite . in this case @xmath202 and the potential has a form : v=2g_1 ^ 2 - 4g_1 ^ 2  .",
    "the critical point corresponds to @xmath216 and @xmath217 again in this case we find that the tachyon mass is related to the potential as @xmath218 .",
    "to summarize , in all cases of n=4 and n=2 gauged supergravities which we looked at , we find tachyons with relation to the curvature of the de sitter space of the form @xmath219 .",
    "the situation for gauged n=2 supergravities may be more complicated in general and required additional consideration .",
    "there is another class of potentials which should not be overlooked in our search for de sitter solutions . for certain values of parameters",
    "the potentials have flat directions corresponding to minkowski space with @xmath220 .",
    "existence of minkowski or near - minkowski ground state is a pre - requisite of a successful inflationary cosmology , so even though at the classical level such potentials do not have any de sitter solutions , their existence is rather intriguing .",
    "several examples of such models have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding results can be summarized by the following table .     &",
    "v(s_cr , t_cr ) & m^2_1 & m^2_2 + 1 & 1 & 6 & 1 & 0 & 0 & any & 14 & 0 & 2e^-6t_cr & 0 + 2 & 1 & 5 & & & & & & & 0 & 0 + 2 & 2 & 4 & & & & & & & 0 & 0 + 2 & 3 & 3 & 0 & 1,0,-1 & any&any&14 & 0&0&0 + 2 & 4 & 2 & & & & & & & 0 & 0 + 2 & 5 & 1 & & & & & & & 0 & 0 +    the class of theories in this table has a possibility to be related to m - theory avoiding the non - compactness problem . in all cases here @xmath221 , thus there is no negative components of the metric on the hypersurface ( [ hypersurf ] ) .",
    "instead , there are some non - compact @xmath222 directions , for example , in @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 case the internal space is @xmath228 and the symmetry is @xmath229 .",

    "@xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 the potential of the scalar fields @xmath145 and @xmath146 looks as follows : @xmath232    this potential blows up at large negative @xmath146 and at large @xmath233 , it is even with respect to @xmath145 , and it vanishes for all @xmath146 along the valley @xmath234 , see fig . [ valley ] .",
    "its curvature is positive in all directions , no tachyons are present .",
    "this potential is not of inflationary type , at least at the classical level . indeed",
    ", there is no slow - roll regime of inflationary type in the theories with exponential potentials of type @xmath235 with @xmath236 ; such potentials are too steep . meanwhile , the potential along the valley vanishes , so inflation does not appear for the fields moving along this valley as well",
    ". one could hope that the regime of acceleration may emerge when the fields oscillate in the valley and slowly drift towards positive @xmath146 .",
    "however , the energy density of the oscillating field rapidly drops down .",
    "we have checked numerically , for various initial conditions for @xmath145 and @xmath146 , that the cosmological evolution in the theory with this potential is not inflationary .",
    "a similar situation appears in the model with @xmath237 , described in the lower part of the table . in this model",
    "the potential vanishes ( i.e. the cosmological constant is equal to zero ) for all @xmath145 and @xmath146 . once again",
    ", in this case one does not have an inflationary regime .",
    "however , it might happen that the flat directions can be lifted due to quantum effects .",
    "note that in these models supersymmetry is broken along the flat directions , so it does not protect the effective potential against radiative corrections .    in this respect",
    "it is instructive to remember the recent example related to p - term inflation in n=2 @xcite , as well as very similar examples of d - term inflation @xcite and f - term inflation in n=1 @xcite .",
    "the effective potential in p - term inflation at the classical level has several minkowski flat directions with unbroken supersymmetry .",
    "perturbative effects can not lift up these flat directions and give rise to inflation .",
    "however , once one takes into account possible fi terms , these flat directions are lifted up to a state with @xmath8 .",
    "they still remain flat , but they correspond to de sitter vacuum with broken supersymmetry .",
    "then the radiative corrections , which appear because of the supersymmetry breaking , make the effective potential @xmath0 slightly tilted .",
    "this leads to a realization of the hybrid inflation scenario in n=2 .",
    "we do not know whether anything like that will happen in n=8 , but this is a very interesting possibility that deserves separate investigation .",
    "one should note also that in this paper we concentrated on the investigation of potentials with extrema at finite values of the scalar fields .",
    "however , one may also look for possible classical potentials that may have flat directions approaching de sitter state with @xmath8 or minkowski state with @xmath238 _ only asymptotically_. from the point of view of cosmology such potentials are very interesting : they can describe inflation at large @xmath37 and quintessence at small @xmath37 .",
    "in this paper we investigated the possibility to have de sitter - like solutions describing inflation / accelerated expansion of the universe in some n=8,4 , 2 gauged supergravities . in each model that we have studied",
    "we have found that de sitter state corresponds to a single unstable extremum of the scalar potential @xmath0 .",
    "the ( negative ) curvature of the potential in the direction of the fastest descent in all of these models obeys the simple rule : @xmath99 in units @xmath38 .",
    "( note that throughout the paper we are using the following definition of the planck mass : @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is the gravitational coupling constant . )",
    "this relation can be represented in the following way : @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the tachyonic mass corresponding to the excitation in the direction of the fastest descent , and @xmath4 is the curvature scalar , @xmath243 .",
    "it would be very interesting to find a simple geometric explanation of this relation .",
    "more general relations between tachyonic @xmath244 and a potential may be possible , particularly in @xmath245 theories @xcite . in this paper we concentrated on the derivation of this relation for a large class of models , and on investigation of its consequences .",
    "one of the consequences is that the slow - roll inflationary regime is impossible near the extrema of the scalar potential in such models .",
    "note , however , that this conclusion may change when one takes into account more scalar fields and more general gaugings . in n=2",
    "gauged supergravities with vector and hypermultiplets one may expect some new results .",
    "we have studied only those models of n=8,4,2 supergravities for which an explicit expression for the potential was known . in these models",
    "the potential depends only on one or two scalar fields .",
    "thus it may happen that some of our conclusions are not generic .",
    "it would be interesting , in particular , to look for potentials that have flat directions with @xmath246 asymptotically approaching minkowski vacuum with @xmath247 or de sitter vacuum with @xmath248 , which would correspond to the present state of the universe .",
    "if such a regime is possible , one may start looking for it already at the classical level .",
    "one may also try to find out whether the flat directions with @xmath238 , which are present in some versions of @xmath249 gauged supergravity , can be lifted up by quantum effects , and can be used for implementation of inflation .",
    "an example of how this possibility could be realized in n= 2 have been recently given in @xcite ; see also examples in n= 1 given in @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one is only interested in describing the present stage of quasi - exponential expansion of the universe in a state with @xmath250 , the danger of the vacuum instability can be removed to a very distant future , hundreds of billions of years from the present epoch : the universe with @xmath251 may experience more than 100 e - folds of fast - roll inflation , which is more than sufficient to explain the present stage of accelerated expansion .",
    "of course , such models require rather extreme values of parameters , but it is still interesting that such a regime is possible despite the expected strong instability of de sitter space with @xmath99 .",

    "<S> this is equivalent to the relation @xmath2 for the tachyonic mass @xmath3 , the curvature scalar @xmath4 , and the hubble constant h. this prevents the use of de sitter extrema for slow - roll inflation in the early universe , which would require @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> barring the question how realistic such models could be , one can use them for the description of the accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to a novel possibility of the fast - roll inflation with @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we also display some potentials that have flat directions with vanishing cosmological constant , and discuss their possible cosmological implications . </S>"
