    "as originally formulated by kontsevich @xcite , homological mirror symmetry ( from now on , hms ) relates the derived category of coherent sheaves on a calabi - yau variety @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the fukaya category of a symplectic manifold @xmath4 , by stating that if @xmath2 and @xmath4 are mirror partners , then @xmath5 . since its proposal ,",
    "much work has been done towards establishing kontsevich s conjecture in important classes of examples , see @xcite , and references therein .",
    "one of the main obstacles for tackling kontsevich s conjecture is gaining a sufficient understanding of the fukaya category . starting in 2009 , in various talks , kontsevich has argued @xcite that the fukaya category of a stein manifold should have good local - to - global properties , and therefore conjecturally could be recovered as the global sections of a suitable sheaf of dg categories .",
    "this is in keeping with previous work of nadler and zaslow who , in @xcite and @xcite , establish an equivalence between the fukaya category of exact lagrangians in a cotangent bundle @xmath6 , and the dg category of complexes of cohomologically constructible sheaves over @xmath2 , @xmath7 . simply as ` constructible sheaves . ' for a comprehensive introduction to the subject we refer the reader to @xcite . ]",
    "following kontsevich s insight , in @xcite , joint with treumann and zaslow , we equip the lagrangian skeleton of a punctured riemann surface @xmath8 with a sheaf of dg categories , called @xmath9 , stands for ` constructible plumbing model , ' as this framework can be applied more generally to investigate the fukaya category of a plumbing of cotangent bundles , for which see also @xcite . ]",
    "such that its local behavior is dictated by nadler and zaslow s work on cotangent bundles , while its global sections are conjecturally quasi - equivalent to the fukaya category of compact exact lagrangians in @xmath8 , @xmath10 .",
    "further , in @xcite , using this model as a stand in for the fukaya category , we prove a version of hms which pairs suitable stacky , degenerate elliptic curves , called _ tcnc _ curves ( see section [ sec : tcnc ] ) , and punctured symplectic tori .    in the first part of this paper ,",
    "we give a quick review of the results contained in @xcite , with a special emphasis on motivations and examples . in section [ sec : cpm ] , after introducing the necessary background , we define @xmath9 as a sheaf of dg categories on a suitable grothendieck site of decorated ribbon graphs , and open inclusions . the applications to mirror symmetry",
    "are explained in section [ sec : hms ] . given a tcnc curve @xmath11 , we explain how to construct a ribbon graph @xmath12 , which arises as the skeleton of a punctured symplectic torus @xmath13 , and we prove that there is an equivalence @xmath14 . granting the conjectural equivalence @xmath15 , we obtain a hms statement relating @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "the hms statement proved in @xcite can be used to explore the algebraic geometry of tcnc curves . in section [ sec : deq ] we prove that , up to derived equivalence , tcnc curves are classified by the sum of the orders of the isotropy groups at the nodes .",
    "this generalizes work of mukai on derived auto - equivalences of smooth elliptic curves @xcite , and of burban and kreussler who considered the case of the nodal @xmath16 @xcite . from the standpoint of mirror symmetry",
    ", this result corresponds to the simple fact that the fukaya category of a punctured riemann surface depends exclusively on genus , and number of punctures .",
    "* acknowledgments : * i wish to thank the organizers of `` mirror symmetry and tropical geometry '' for making possible this very stimulating event .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank david treumann and eric zaslow for numerous conversations about the results described here , and for our collaboration @xcite , which is the starting point of this project .",
    "in this section we review the construction of @xmath9 . we will follow closely the exposition of @xcite , but we shall gloss over many technical aspects of the theory , for which we refer the reader to the original paper .",
    "section [ sec : mic ] contains a brief overview of definitions and results from microlocal sheaf theory which will be needed later , and a preliminary , ` local , ' definition of @xmath9 .",
    "section [ sec : quiv ] discusses a useful dictionary between category of sheaves , and categories of quiver representations . in section [ sec : chord ] we introduce the notion of _ chordal _ ribbon graph , and give the full definition of @xmath9 , as a sheaf of dg categories over the grothendieck site of chordal ribbon graphs .    before proceeding , it is convenient to clarify what we mean by sheaf of dg categories .",
    "recall that , following tabuada @xcite , we can equip the category of small dg categories , @xmath17 , with a model structure . for us , a sheaf on a site @xmath18 with values in a model category @xmath19 is a pre - sheaf @xmath20 , such that , whenever @xmath21 is a covering sieve for @xmath22 , the diagram @xmath23\\ ] ] is a _ homotopy _ limit in @xmath19 . the sheaf property can be verified in practice quite easily , using the following description of equalizers in @xmath17 .",

    "we have signaled the zero section by drawing it with a thicker line.,height=192 ]    dualizable ribbon graphs are constructed by adjoining together wheels as in the two examples above , it is important to point out that , as shown in figure [ fig : dual ] , in a dualizable ribbon graph the strands joining together the components of the zero section can not be ( non - trivially ) ` braided . '",
    "this can be translated in appropriate conditions of coherency on the maps @xmath248 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further details . ] and are therefore completely determined up to isomorphism by their genus , which is equal to @xmath176 or @xmath0 , can be described geometrically as the genus of any surface in which @xmath149 can be embedded , in a way compatible with the ribbon structure , as a deformation retract .",
    "thus @xmath242 in example [ ex : dual ] ( 1 ) has genus @xmath176 , while @xmath246 in example [ ex : dual ] ( 2 ) , has genus @xmath0 . for a formal , combinatorial definition of the genus of a ribbon graph ,",
    "see @xcite . ] and by a tuple of positive integers recording the number of edges connecting the different components of the chordal zero section , @xmath159 .",
    "this is entirely analogus to the case of tcnc curves , which was discussed in section [ sec : tcnc ] .",
    "let @xmath204 , and let @xmath249 be a tuple of positive integers , and denote @xmath250 the dualizable ribbon graph identified , in the manner explained above , by the pair of @xmath88 and @xmath251 .",
    "[ thm : hms ] there is an equivalence of dg categories @xmath252    there is a covering of @xmath250 given by wheels @xmath253 .",
    "then , by the sheaf property of @xmath141 we have an equalizer diagram @xmath254 the theorem then follows immediately from theorem [ thm : wheels ] ( and remark [ rem : stalk ] ) , and theorem [ thm : perf ] .",
    "as discussed above , dualizable ribbon graphs @xmath250 arise as skeleta of punctured curves of genus @xmath88 with appropriate stein structure . granting conjecture [ conj ] , theorem [ thm : hms ]",
    "can therefore be interpreted as a hms statement , relating punctured symplectic surfaces , and degenerate , nodal algebraic curves , having equal genus @xmath204 . in particular",
    ", this confirms the well known mirror symmetry heuristics according to which the mirror of a symplectic torus with @xmath110 punctures should be a a cycle of @xmath110 rational curves .",
    "is also treated in @xcite . ]",
    "the fukaya category of a punctured riemann surface @xmath8 should depend solely on the symplectic geometry of @xmath8 , which is encoded in its genus , and in the number of punctures . in view of conjecture [ conj ] , this suggests that if @xmath149 and @xmath255 are ( chordal ) ribbon graphs arising as skeleta of a unique punctured surface @xmath8 equipped with two different stein structures , there should be an equivalence @xmath256 .",
    "in this section we sketch a proof that this is indeed the case for dualizable ribbon graphs , by introducing a simple graphical calculus which will enable us to construct this equivalence in a step - by - step fashion",
    ". a precise statement of our theorem is collected below .",
    "if @xmath257 , we denote @xmath258 the @xmath110-tuple filled with @xmath0-s . by slight abuse of notation , we shall also denote @xmath259 a tuple of length @xmath260 , of the form @xmath261",
    ".              denote @xmath268 a cycle of rational curves with @xmath110 components .",
    "corollary [ cor : fm ] implies in particular that there is an equivalence @xmath269)$ ] , where @xmath270 is the group of @xmath110-th roots of unity , acting on @xmath271 in the obvious manner , and @xmath272 $ ] is the quotient stack . as we shall explain , this result can be interpreted as a generalization to the singular case of mukai s classic work on derived equivalences of smooth elliptic curves ( and , more generally , of principally polarised abelian varieties ) @xcite .",
    "recall that mukai shows that , if @xmath2 and @xmath273 are dual abelian varieties , there is a non - trivial equivalence @xmath274 , which he defines via a pull - push formalism , by taking as kernel the universal bundle on the product @xmath275 .    as in the smooth case ,",
    "the nodal projective line @xmath271 is isomorphic to its dual @xmath276 , which is the moduli space of rank @xmath0 , degree @xmath176 , torsion - free sheaves over @xmath271 @xcite .",
    "further , one can show that @xmath268 , which is the @xmath110-fold cover of @xmath271 , parametrizes _",
    "@xmath270-equivariant _ sheaves on @xmath271 satisfying the properties just listed .",
    "in this perspective , we can interpret the covering map @xmath277 as induced by ` forgetting the equivariant structure . '",
    "thus , @xmath268 is isomorphic to the moduli space of rank @xmath0 , degree @xmath176 , torsion - free sheaves over the quotient stack @xmath272 $ ] or , in other words , @xmath268 is dual , in the sense discussed above , to @xmath272 $ ] .",
    "the existence of an equivalence @xmath269)$ ] therefore fits well with what we would expect based on the smooth case .",
    "note that the case @xmath278 was also studied by burban and kreussler @xcite , who use the theory of spherical functors to define a non - trivial derived equivalence @xmath279 having the required properties .",
    "punctures on @xmath280 .",
    "the argument we shall describe below can be interpreted , roughly , as defining an action of an appropriate version of the mapping class _ groupoid_. for a definition of spherical functor , see @xcite . ]      in this section we introduce a set of operations , called _ elementary moves _ , which can be used to modify the geometry of chordal ribbon graphs while preserving the global sections of @xmath9 .",
    "first , however , we spell out the behaviour of @xmath9 on some especially simple chordal ribbon graphs , which can be used as building blocks for all trivalent graphs in @xmath162 .",
    "let @xmath281 be a ribbon graph with empty vertex set , and underlying @xmath282 complex homeomorphic to @xmath41 .",
    "we can equip @xmath281 with two distinct chordal structures @xmath283 , by setting either @xmath284 , or @xmath285 .",
    "in both cases , @xmath286 .",
    "thus , if @xmath170 is a chordal ribbon graph , and @xmath287 is the set of edges of @xmath149 , restriction to the edges yields _ stalk _ functors , indexed by @xmath99 , @xmath288 which generalize the ` microlocal stalks ' discussed in section [ sec : mic ] .",
    "it is often convenient to indicate an object @xmath289 by assigning the collection of its stalks @xmath290 , which can be visualized as labels attached to the edges @xmath291 of @xmath149 .",
    "a _ pitchfork _ is a chordal ribbon graph @xmath292 , such that @xmath149 is isomorphic to the union of the real line @xmath41 , and an upward spoke @xmath125 . as shown by figure [ fig : pitch ] above , there are only two possible choices of zero section , which yield inequivalent chordal ribbon graphs @xmath293 , @xmath294 . in either case , using theorem [ thm : quiverquiver ] , we can see that the global sections of @xmath9 are given by @xmath295 .",
    "the edges of the graphs represented in figure [ fig : pitch ] are decorated with labels corresponding to an object @xmath296 .",
    "thus , for instance , the picture indicates that the stalk of @xmath297 on any point lying on the edge @xmath298 , is isomorphic to @xmath299 .",
    "the set of the _ elementary moves _ , or @xmath300-s , which we shall use in the proof of theorem [ thm : move ] , is given in the table below ( figure [ fig : moves ] ) .",
    "note that the ribbon graphs considered in figure [ fig : moves ] are obtained by gluing together pitchforks along common edges , and thus we can easily compute the sections of @xmath9 over them using lemma [ lem : ho eq ] .        for each elementary move @xmath301 ,",
    "let @xmath302 be the graph appearing on the left of the ` @xmath303 ' symbol , and @xmath304 the graph appearing on the right .",
    "@xmath300-s preserve global sections of @xmath9 , and there is a preferred isomorphism @xmath305 .",
    "we have labelled the edges of @xmath302 , and @xmath304 , with the stalks of @xmath306 , and @xmath307 , respectively .",
    "this schematics gives enough information for reconstructing @xmath308 entirely .",
    "below , we shall see how this works in a concrete example .",
    "also , in order to simplify notations , we have indicated the cone of a map @xmath309 simply by @xmath310 .",
    "although @xmath311 can be obtained simply by iterating @xmath312 , we have inserted it in the table given in figure [ fig : moves ] , because in section [ sec : pfmo ] it will be convenient to apply this transformation directly , without factoring it into simpler @xmath300-s .",
    "the proof that elementary transformations do in fact preserve sections of @xmath9 is not hard , and we omit the details .",
    "however , as an example of the kind of arguments involved , it might be useful to discuss briefly the case of @xmath312 .",
    "note that , following the notations of figure [ fig : pitch ] , @xmath313 can be constructed by gluing together edges @xmath298 of @xmath293 , and @xmath314 of @xmath294 .",
    "an object in @xmath315 is given therefore by a triple of the form @xmath316 now , take @xmath317 in @xmath318 .",
    "since @xmath318 is a dg ( pre-)triangulated category , it follows from the _ octahedral axiom _ that there is a map @xmath319 \\rightarrow \\mathsf{c}(g)[-1]$ ] , and a natural isomorphism @xmath320 .",
    "thus we can define @xmath321 on objects by setting @xmath322 \\stackrel{p}{\\rightarrow } \\mathsf{c}(g)[-1 ] , \\mathsf{c}(f ) \\cong \\mathsf{c}(p)),\\ ] ] and the definition on morphisms is obvious .",
    "figure [ fig : blocks ] represents two different kinds of chordal ribbon graphs , which are denoted @xmath323 , and @xmath324 , with @xmath325 .",
    "all tri - valent dualizable ribbon graph can be assembled by gluing along their external edges a certain number of copies of graphs of type @xmath251 and @xmath326 . in order to prove theorem [ thm : move ] , it is therefore enough to show that for every @xmath110 there exists an equivalence @xmath327 , with the property that @xmath328 preserves the stalks on the @xmath158 external edges @xmath291 , and @xmath329 .",
    "are ` non - trivially braided . '",
    "the existence of the equivalence @xmath328 depends , in fact , in a crucial way on the choice of this particular geometry .",
    "note however that the zero section of a dualizable ribbon graph is a union of loops .",
    "considered as edges of the larger graph , the strands in a subgraph of type @xmath251 can therefore be un - braided , cf . also footnote [ foot : braid ] . ] in fact , starting with any dualizable ribbon graph , we can turn it into a dualizable graph having weight vector with entries all equal to @xmath0 by successively replacing its subgraphs of type @xmath251 with subgraphs of type @xmath326 .",
    "the availabilty of the equivalences @xmath328 insures that , while doing so , we are not affecting the sections of @xmath9 ( up to isomorphism ) .      to define the @xmath328-s",
    ", we have to break down the algorithm just described in yet smaller subroutines . for all @xmath325 , we identify suitable subgraphs of @xmath323 isomorphic to the graphs appearing in figure [ fig : moves ] , and we modify their geometry via the appropriate elementary move .",
    "this gives rise to a new graph , which we can manipulate in similar manner , until , after a finite number of steps , we achieve the geometry of @xmath324 .",
    "this procedure involves keeping track of what happens to the stalks across @xmath300-s , to make sure that our operations , which are local in nature , determine equivalences at the level of global sections of @xmath9 .",
    "this can be easily done , using the information on stalks given by figure [ fig : moves ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : move ] can therefore be reduced to a simple graphical calculus , which is illustrated in figures [ fig : n2 ] , and [ fig : n3 ] below , for the cases @xmath330 , and @xmath331 . at each step",
    "we apply an elementary move , which is explicitly indicated over the symbol ` @xmath303 . '",
    "it is important to notice that , is some of these steps , we are simulataneously applying the same elementary move to two distinct subgraphs . the strategy for proving the statement in the general case can be easily extrapolated from here , and therefore we will not discuss it in any further detail ."
