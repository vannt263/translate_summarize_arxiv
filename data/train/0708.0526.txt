    "the absorption of photons in a dielectric solid can lead to delocalized excitations called excitons .",
    "these excitons are essentially of two types : the wannier excitons @xcite and the frenkel excitons @xcite .",
    "wannier excitons are formed in inorganic semiconductors .",
    "the relative motion of the electron and the hole from which the excitons are made , encompasses hundred of unit cells .",
    "this leads to a small binding energy ( @xmath0 mev ) and a large bohr radius ( @xmath0 nm ) . as a consequence ,",
    "wannier excitons start to interact at relatively low densities , giving rise to a large variety of many - body effects associated with optical nonlinearities , which makes these conventional semiconductors used in today s technologies .",
    "the second type of exciton , known as frenkel exciton , is commonly found in organic crystals .",
    "these crystals are of potential importance for future electronic devices , which makes them under current intensive studies 8,9,10,11,12,13 .",
    "frenkel excitons are formed with electron and hole localized on a small scale , of the order of a single molecular block ( @xmath1 nm ) , the typical binding energy being of the order of 1 ev .",
    "due to interactions between blocks ,",
    "these single molecule excitations are transferred from site to site , giving rise to a wave known as frenkel exciton .",
    "these pictures can be qualitatively understood by noting that , in conventional ( inorganic ) semiconductor , the relative dielectric constant is rather large ( @xmath0 ) , which makes the screening of the interaction between carriers quite strong . as a result ,",
    "the attraction between electrons and holes is weak , which explains the large extension of their relative motion wave function . on the opposite",
    ", the small relative dielectric constant of molecular crystals ( @xmath2 ) leads to a strong electron - hole attraction which localizes the pair on a system unit cell .",
    "the separation between wannier and frenkel excitons , of course , is not very sharp .",
    "recent works @xcite have shown the limitations of the simple frenkel picture for excitons in organic semiconductors and the necessity to introduce `` charge - transfer excitons '' in which the electron and the hole are located in different sites , with similarity to wannier excitons for which the distance between electron and hole is large compared to the ion - ion distance . along the same line , recent progresses in device nanofabrication now allow one to obtain organic / inorganic semiconductor structure in which the hybridization between frenkel and wannier excitons can be produced 8,9 .",
    "due to their small exciton bohr radius , interactions between frenkel excitons are expected to occur at a much larger density than the one at which many - body effects between wannier excitons start to be noticeable .",
    "this barely comes from the fact that the dimensionless parameter which controls these many - body effects is@xmath3where @xmath4  is the exciton bohr radius , @xmath5 the sample size , @xmath6 the space dimension , and @xmath7 the exciton number - the exciton density being @xmath8 .",
    "most likely , as for wannier excitons , interactions between frenkel excitons are going to be of importance in electronic devices constructed with organic semiconductors .",
    "this is why a correct treatment of these interactions is highly desirable .",
    "being made of indistinguishable carriers , frenkel excitons , like wannier excitons , are not well defined objects , which makes the interactions _ between _ excitons not possible to identify properly . as a direct consequence , one can not describe these interactions through a potential , as usually done by lack of a correct procedure .    over the last few years",
    ", we have developed a new many - body theory @xcite for wannier excitons , in which the composite nature of the particles is treated exactly .",
    "we have shown that wannier excitons predominantly interact through the pauli exclusion principle which exists between their fermionic components .",
    "this exclusion gives rise to very many carrier exchanges between excitons which are nicely visualized through shiva diagrams @xcite , rather different from feynman diagrams due to the composite character of the particles .",
    "all our works on wannier excitons end with the same conclusion : it is not possible to replace composite excitons by elementary excitons , as commonly done through sophisticated bosonization procedures @xcite ; either one misses terms as large as the ones kept , or , in optical nonlinear effects , one even misses the dominant terms @xcite . this can be readily seen from a dimensional argument : the pauli scatterings associated with carrier exchanges are dimensionless , while the coulomb scatterings are energy - like quantities ; so that they have to appear with an energy denominator , which can only be a photon detuning .",
    "this makes these coulomb terms completely negligible in front of the pure exchange terms - missed with bosonized excitons - when unabsorbed photons have a large detuning .",
    "the development of a similar procedure for frenkel excitons requires to settle a second quantization formalism for these excitons on a clean basis in order to possibly keep their composite boson nature exactly all over the calculations .",
    "in contrast , the works on interacting frenkel excitons , we have up to now seen @xcite , contain a potential written as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 creates an excitation on site @xmath11 .",
    "besides the fact that interactions between excitons can not be written as a potential due to the composite nature of these particles , by writing such a potential in terms of @xmath10 only , one obviously losses the composite electron - hole nature of this excitation which exists in the exact potentials between electrons and holes ( as seen below from eqs .",
    "( 4.6,13 ) .",
    "this is exactly this composite nature that we want to treat properly , since we know its importance in the case of wannier excitons .    in this first work on frenkel excitons",
    ", we propose a microscopic approach to the description of these excitons based on a second quantization formalism , starting from the hamiltonian of free electrons in a periodic lattice . through a grouping of terms different from the one leading to wannier excitons",
    ", we introduce the atomic states as a physically relevant one - electron basis for frenkel excitons and we rewrite the system hamiltonian in terms of electrons and holes localized on atomic sites in order to have a precise description of the interactions .",
    "since we use a second quantization scheme in terms of electrons and holes separately - and not in terms of their product @xmath10 as usually done - our approach automatically takes into account the fermionic composite nature of the particles forming the frenkel excitons .",
    "this is going to be of crucial importance for a proper study of many - body effects involving these excitons .",
    "the present preliminary work actually provides the necessary grounds for further works on frenkel exciton systems . in a forthcoming publication",
    ", we are going to use this second quantization formalism to derive the coulomb and pauli scatterings of two frenkel excitons : these are the elementary scatterings on which all many - body effects dealing with excitons are based .",
    "we will then use these scatterings to calculate the ground state energy of @xmath12 frenkel excitons in the low density limit , a physical quantity of basic relevance .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we start with the first quantization description of a periodic system made of interacting ions and electrons .",
    "we discuss the conceptual difference between wannier and frenkel excitons which leads to a different grouping of terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "we introduce the atomic states as the appropriate one - electron basis for the problem when the tight - binding approximation , which neglect the overlaps between the atomic wave functions for electrons on different sites , is valid .",
    "we also discuss the conceptual difficulty associated to the atomic basis compared to the free electron and hole basis used in the case of wannier excitons . in section iii , we derive the semiconductor hamiltonian appropriate to frenkel excitons in second quantization using this atomic basis . in section iv , we switch to holes and we reduce the hamiltonian to the terms which conserve the number of electron - hole pairs .",
    "we then discuss all these terms with a particular attention to the one responsible for the excitation transfer from site to site . in section",
    "v , we identify the lowest excited states of the hamiltonian in the absence of interactions between sites and we show that they form a degenerate subspace . this degeneracy is split to give rise to frenkel excitons by the intersite interactions .",
    "they are introduced in section vi , which is devoted to the precise derivation of the creation operators for frenkel exciton and the commutation rules which govern these operators .",
    "the precise handling of these commutators are at the basis of the many - body theory we are going to construct .",
    "we show that , like wannier excitons , frenkel excitons are composite bosons , their commutation rules differing from the ones of elementary bosons due to the fermionic nature of the electrons and holes forming these excitons . in section vii",
    ", we collect the main results of this paper and conclude .",
    "let us consider @xmath13 electrons with charge @xmath14 , located at @xmath15 and @xmath13 ions with charge @xmath16 , located at @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and @xmath11 running from 1 to the number of sites @xmath13 .  in this first work on frenkel excitons",
    ", we are going to forget all spin degrees of freedom for the sake of simplicity .",
    "this physically corresponds to have all the electrons with the same spin .",
    "this also means that we drop all degeneracies coming from the orbital part of the electronic levels .",
    "these spin and orbital degrees of freedom generate very interesting polarization effects .",
    "they , however , lead to heavy notations which are wise to avoid in a first work .",
    "the semiconductor hamiltonian can be written as@xmath19the one - body operator @xmath20 describes the electron kinetic energy    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the _ free _ electron mass .",
    "the second term of eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) , which describes the electron - ion coulomb attraction , also is a one - electron operator .",
    "it reads @xmath23    the third operator @xmath24 describes the coulomb repulsion between electrons .",
    "this two - body operator is given by    @xmath25    the last term , @xmath26 , which describes the coulomb interaction between ions , is a constant with respect to the electron motion .",
    "it is however necessary to keep it in order to work with the hamiltonian of a fully neutral system .",
    "this is required for the convergence of the coulomb terms in the large sample limit .",
    "we will see below the importance of this point .",
    "wannier excitons are constructed on delocalized electrons excited from the valence band to the conduction band .",
    "these semiconductor bands result from the periodic ionic structure of the semiconductor lattice .",
    "a simple way to make these bands appearing is to add and substract a one - electron operator    @xmath27    to the semiconductor hamiltonian @xmath28 .  yet arbitrary , @xmath29 physically represents a mean electron - electron interaction .",
    "we will show below the appropriate way to choose it .",
    "this leads us to rewrite the semiconductor hamiltonian @xmath28 , given by eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) , as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , usually called `` semiconductor coulomb interaction '' , corresponds to the difference    @xmath32    the zero order hamiltonian for wannier excitons @xmath33 is a sum of one - electron operators . it can thus be written as    @xmath34    where the one - electron operator @xmath35 is given by@xmath36this one - electron operator has the lattice periodicity if @xmath37  is chosen with such a periodicity .",
    "besides this requirement , we must also enforce @xmath38 to be such that the resulting interaction @xmath39  defined in eq .",
    "( 2.8 ) fulfills    @xmath40    in order for @xmath41 to be the hamiltonian of a fully neutral system .",
    "the simplest choice for @xmath38 is to take it as a constant , through the so - called `` positive jellium '' , namely , @xmath42 .    due to the periodicity of the potential @xmath39 ,",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath41 are made of delocalized states separated by band gaps .",
    "the relevant ones for the physics of wannier excitons belong to the last filled band , called valence band , and the first empty band , called conduction band .",
    "close to these band extrema , the eigenstate energies can be written as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the band gap , while @xmath46  and @xmath47 are the electron masses for the conductance and valence bands dressed by the lattice periodic potential .",
    "note that the effective mass for valence electrons , which are close to a maximum is negative ; so that resulting valence hole mass , defined as @xmath48 , is positive .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath49 of the hamiltonian @xmath41 with @xmath50equal to @xmath51 or @xmath52 for valence and conduction states @xmath53are then used as a one - electron basis , to rewrite the semiconductor hamiltonian @xmath28 in the second quantization .",
    "the situation for frenkel excitons is totally different : while wannier excitons are constructed on delocalized valence and conduction electron states , the physical picture of the semiconductor excitations giving rise to frenkel excitons is a set of electrons tight to their ions , these electrons switching from the atomic ground state to the atomic first excited level .",
    "consequently , the physically relevant one - electron states for frenkel excitons are not the free ( delocalized ) electrons in a periodic lattice , used in the case of wannier excitons , but instead the electron localized atomic states associated to the various ion sites .    in order to make these physically relevant atomic states appearing , we are led to perform a grouping of terms in the semiconductor hamiltonian @xmath28 , given in eq .",
    "( 2.1 ) , different from the one we have done for wannier excitons .",
    "this new grouping of terms is@xmath54the zero order hamiltonian for frenkel excitons @xmath55 still is a one - electron operator , but it now contains the electron kinetic contribution plus the electron - ion potential ; so that it differs from the zero order hamiltonian for wannier excitons @xmath33 .",
    "it precisely reads @xmath56where @xmath57 is now given by @xmath58      we can note that , in the one - electron hamiltonian @xmath57 , enter the interactions of the electron @xmath18 with _ all _ the ions @xmath11 ; so that @xmath59 differs from a simple atomic hamiltonian .",
    "nevertheless , it is rather clear that the physically relevant one - electron states for frenkel excitons are going to be these atomic states , i.e. , the eigenstates of one electron in presence of _ one _ ion .",
    "let us introduce them .",
    "\\(i ) the atomic states @xmath60 for one ion located at @xmath61 , associated to the hamiltonian    @xmath62    are such that    @xmath63    their wave functions being @xmath64 .",

    ".    \\(iii ) if we now turn to the hamiltonian @xmath55 , given in eq .",
    "( 2.13 ) , we see that it differs from a bare sum of atomic hamiltonians , since each electron feels the interaction of all the other ions .",
    "this is a real difficulty : unlike wannier excitons , in which the eigenstates of @xmath77 can be obtained exactly , the diagonalization of the one - body part of @xmath55 for frenkel excitons can only be approximated due to this multiple ion interaction . as shown below , this will force us to make assumption on the atomic wave functions extensions , the frenkel exciton picture being appropriate when the tight - binding approximation is valid .    due to the sum over all ions contained in the one - body hamiltonian @xmath78 given in eq .",
    "( 2.13 ) , it is , on the one hand , clear that the states @xmath79 , for a _ fixed _",
    "@xmath11 ( which form a complete set for one - electron states due to eq .",
    "( 2.19 ) ) can not be a physically relevant basis to describe frenkel excitons made of excitations on all possible ion sites .",
    "on the other hand , it is also clear that if we now leave @xmath11 running over all the ion positions , the states @xmath80 for all @xmath76 and all @xmath11 form an overcomplete set - the states @xmath79 for one particular @xmath11 forming a complete set already . as a bare consequence of this overcompleteness , the states @xmath79 with different @xmath11",
    "are not exactly orthogonal .    however , when the atomic states @xmath76 and @xmath81 are highly localized compared to the ion - ion distance , the wave function overlap between different atoms is essentially zero    @xmath82    whatever @xmath83 is .",
    "consequently , the scalar product of such atomic states reduces to    @xmath84    due to eq .",
    "( 2.16 ) : these states @xmath79 are thus quasi - orthogonal .",
    "\\(iv ) in spite of these difficulties , linked to the overcompleteness of the states @xmath79 with @xmath11 running over all ion sites , the @xmath79  states have to play a role in the frenkel exciton physics .",
    "this is why we are going to use them in the second quantization description of frenkel excitons .    before going further ,",
    "let us add some comments on using these states @xmath85 as a basis for second quantization .",
    "it is clear that eqs .",
    "( 2.20 ) is not valid for atomic extended states , nor even for the highest bound levels .",
    "the states @xmath79 can however be seen as a nice basis for one - electron states if the problem at hand relies on the highly localized ( lowest ) atomic states , for which the overlaps between atomic wave functions for different ions is negligible .",
    "this is actually the case for conventional frenkel excitons , in which the @xmath86 s of interest reduce to the ground state ( @xmath87 ) and the first excited state ( @xmath88 ) .    a somewhat cleaner way to present the use of these overcomplete states",
    "@xmath85 is to say that we can always add to the two sets of atomic states of physical interest , namely , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , other states constructed `` in an appropriate way '' , in order to form a complete orthogonal basis when added to the two states @xmath91 . in problems physically controlled by the two lowest atomic states , these additional `` appropriate states '' are not going to play a role in the final results .",
