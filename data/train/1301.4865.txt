    "the basic model is that of a stationary axisymmetric force - free dipole , where the magnetic and rotational axes are aligned , the electromagnetic forces balanced and the particle inertia is ignored .",
    "the problem lies in guessing a current distribution which makes the self - consistent magnetic field obey the physically meaningful boundary conditions .",
    "such a current function along with the consequent magnetic field structure was first simulated numerically in the pioneering work of ( * ? ? ?",

    "all the subsequent studies confirmed the formal validity of the original simulations of ( * ? ? ? * contopoulos et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ) , however the physical meaning of the current function obtained is still questionable , since it implies that a part of the return current should flow through the polar gap .",
    "we suggest to revise the commonly used set of boundary conditions in the pulsar force - free problem so as to allow for the presence of the plasma - producing gaps . only in this case",

    "we have found ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "at infinity , the field of a force - free dipole is generally believed to be well represented by the classical split monopole scheme . at finite distances , however , the scheme does not allow for the consequences of essentially dipolar features .",
    "the analogy with an offset monopole enables to account for the outer gap in the pulsar magnetosphere . as the outer gap forms at the intersection of the null line with open magnetic field lines and",
    "is expected to lie entirely within the light cylinder , beyond the light cylinder the null line should coincide with a certain magnetic field line . given that the outer gap is the place of passage of the return current , it is the critical field line that coincides with the null line , in which case both go parallel to the equator at a certain altitude above it , similarly to the case of an offset monopole .        .",
    "based on the above considerations , we suggest that beyond the light cylinder the pulsar force - free field is better represented by the split - offset monopole scheme composed of the two symmetrically offset monopoles of opposite polarity ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . with eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])-([eq2 ] ) it is easy to show that the condition @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the magnetic and electric field strengths , respectively ) is fulfilled everywhere and for any pair @xmath12 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the force - free approximation is valid .",
    "furthermore , for the three horizontal lines in fig.[fig1 ] ( i.e. the two null ( critical ) lines and the equator ) the equilibrium condition @xmath13 ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lyubarsky 1990 ) ) is valid for any relevant pair @xmath12 .",
    "correspondingly , the four regions in fig.[fig1 ] bounded by the three above mentioned horizontal lines may have different @xmath12 .    .",
    "in the split - offset monopole scheme , the current circuit may contain from one to three current sheets located along the null ( critical ) lines and the equator . in the simplest case we have @xmath14 in the equatorial region between the lines @xmath15 and @xmath16 between the magnetic axis and these lines . then the symmetric current sheets along the lines @xmath15 close the current circuit in each hemisphere .",
    "if in the equatorial region @xmath16 as well , the regions on both sides of the lines @xmath15 may join without current sheets , and the return current flows in the equatorial current sheet and along the equatorial lines entering the sheet .",

    "based on the split - offset monopole model , the global structure of the pulsar force - free magnetosphere seems to look as follows ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the polar and outer gaps control different bundles of open field lines divided by the critical line , and the two gaps are adjusted by the slot gap located between them .",
