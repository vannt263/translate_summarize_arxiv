    "although the standard model , based on the gauge symmetry su(3)@xmath1su(2)@xmath1u(1 ) , is impressively successful in describing the existing high - energy experimental results , it is expected to be only the low - energy manifestation of a more fundamental theory , involving extended or additional gauge groups .",
    "the additional gauge interactions may arise for example in the framework of grand unified theories @xcite or theories of dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "even if the fundamental gauge symmetry is broken at a scale far beyond the electroweak breaking scale , the breaking to the standard model gauge group may occur in several steps and some subgroups may remain unbroken at a scale not far from the electroweak scale .",
    "therefore it is interesting to study a possible additional neutral gauge boson @xmath2 with mass below 1 tev .",
    "such a new gauge boson with a mass as low as the order of the @xmath3 mass is still in accordance with all experimental bounds if its couplings to the standard model fermions are very weak @xcite .",
    "current limits from searches at the tevatron @xcite exclude a `` sequential @xmath2 boson '' ( i.e. a @xmath2 boson that has the same couplings as the standard model @xmath3 boson ) with mass below 780 gev . for smaller masses , the sensitivity towards smaller couplings increases . for @xmath2 masses as low as 300 gev or less , the tevatron can exclude @xmath2 bosons with production cross - sections that are about 100 times smaller than for a sequential @xmath2 boson",
    ".    the lep experiments could also place limits on neutral gauge bosons , but the lep data has not been analyzed for weakly coupled @xmath2 bosons .",
    "it is expected that the limits obtainable from lep , normalized to a sequential @xmath2 boson , will be slightly better but comparable to the tevatron limits for @xmath2 bosons with masses below @xmath4 gev @xcite .",
    "the searches for a relatively light weakly coupled @xmath2 boson could be improved by a future @xmath0 high - energy linear collider with high luminosity @xcite , if the @xmath2 boson couples to electrons .",
    "this report estimates the reach of a linear collider for @xmath2 masses of the order of 1 tev , focusing on the case that the mass of the @xmath2 boson is below the @xmath0 center - of - mass energy .",
    "the findings are compared to the reach of the lhc for neutral gauge bosons .",
    "in addition to the discovery potential of an @xmath0 collider , the capabilities of determining the couplings of the @xmath2 boson are investigated . for the most part of the analysis ,",
    "no assumptions are made about the specific model structure that gives rise to the @xmath2 boson .",
    "however , as an example , one interesting class of models studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the standard model is extended by only one additional u(1 ) gauge group and no extra fermions , is analyzed in more detail .",
    "in the general setup for this study it is assumed that mixing effects between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 bosons , introduced through off - diagonal entries in the neutral gauge - boson mass matrix , are negligible .",
    "when both the @xmath3 and @xmath2 bosons couple to the standard model fermions , there will also be kinetic mixing generated by loop contributions at higher orders .",
    "these mixing effects , however , can always be rotated away for on - shell momenta of the gauge bosons by diagonalizing the higher - order propagator matrix . for small @xmath3@xmath2 mixing ,",
    "no important bounds on the @xmath2 boson arise from indirect constraints from @xmath3-pole data .    in this case",
    ", the most stringent bounds are obtained from direct @xmath2 production .",
    "if the coupling @xmath5 of the @xmath2 boson to fermions ( or other possible decay products ) is small , it will form a narrow resonance that is hard to discover in the process @xmath6 .",
    "very stringent constraints can be obtained for values of the @xmath2 mass close to the center - of - mass energy , @xmath7 . when the width is smaller than the detector resolution and the beam energy spread , the production cross - section for @xmath8 can be expressed as @xmath9 = \\frac{6\\pi^2{\\mathswitch { \\gamma_{{\\mathswitchr z}'}}}}{{\\mathswitch { m_{{\\mathswitchr z}'}}}^2 } \\ , { \\mathswitchr{br}}(z ' \\to e^+e^- ) \\ , { \\mathswitchr{br}}(z ' \\to f \\bar{f } ) , \\label{eq : onres}\\ ] ] where the integration is performed over one energy bin . for a narrow @xmath2 resonance away from the nominal center - of - mass energy , @xmath10 , the sensitivity of the process @xmath6 quickly decreases .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the most stringent constraints for @xmath11 are obtained from the case where the invariant mass of the @xmath12system is reduced by initial - state radiation , so that the @xmath2 boson can still be produced on - shell , @xmath13 the leading initial - state radiation effects due to large logarithms , @xmath14 , can be included using the structure - function approach @xcite , @xmath15(s ) = \\int_0 ^ 1 { \\rm d}x_+ \\int_0 ^ 1 { \\rm d}x_-    \\ , g_{ee}(x_+,s ) \\ , g_{ee}(x_-,s ) \\ ;    \\sigma[e^+e^- \\to f \\bar{f}](s x_+ x_-),\\ ] ] with the structure functions up to order @xmath16 @xcite , which is however not relevant for the level of precision of this study . ] and including soft - photon exponentiation given by @xcite @xmath17 & - &   \\displaystyle    \\frac{1}{2 } \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha}{2\\pi } \\right)^2 l^2          \\left [ \\frac{1 + 3x^2}{1-x } \\log x + 4(1+x)\\,\\log(1-x ) + 5 + x \\right ] , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the euler constant .",
    "the additional photons usually escape in the direction of the beam pipe and will not be considered for the signal signature .",
    "besides initial - state radiation , beamstrahlung plays an important role for high - luminosity @xmath0 colliders .",
    "it also leads to an effective reduction of the invariant mass of the hard scattering process . in this work",
    "beamstrahlung effects have been included using the program _ circe _",
    "@xcite for tesla design parameters @xcite .",
    "this program provides effective parameterizations of detailed multi - body simulations obtained from the code _ guinea - pig _ @xcite .",
    "both photonic initial - state radiation and beamstrahlung contribute to the effective cross - section for @xmath2 production .",
    "the effect from beamstrahlung becomes particularly important for @xmath2 masses close to the center - of - mass energy , contributing up to about 50% of the cross - section . for smaller values of the ratio @xmath20",
    ", the contribution from beamstrahlung reduces to a few percent compared to initial - state radiation .",
    "the relative importance of beamstrahlung also grows with increasing beam energy . for this study ,",
    "the beamstrahlung effects have been investigated only for the tesla accelerator proposal .",
    "generally speaking , the nlc / jlc @xcite and clic @xcite linear collider designs generate slightly larger beamstrahlung effects than the tesla design , especially towards the lower end of the beam energy spectrum , i.e. for small effective beam energies ( see e.g. @xcite ) . therefore the search prospects for @xmath2 bosons with @xmath21 are slightly better for the nlc / jlc and clic designs as opposed to the tesla design .",
    "however , since in this region the cross - section is dominantly generated by initial - state radiation , the general results of this study remain valid also for these other accelerator designs .",
    "the main background to the signal process ( [ eq : radreturn ] ) arises from fermion pair production through s - channel photon or @xmath3 boson exchange , @xmath22 additional backgrounds arise from processes with higher particle multiplicity in the final state , for example leptons in conjunction with additional neutrinos or four - quark final states from @xmath23-boson or tau pair production .",
    "for a realistic experimental analysis , the four - fermion backgrounds may play a non - negligible role and should be taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , since these backgrounds are sub - dominant with respect to the process ( [ eq : bk ] ) , they will not modify the discovery reach for a @xmath2 boson in a significant way and are thus not included in the present study .",
    "both the signal ( [ eq : radreturn ] ) and background ( [ eq : bk ] ) contributions have been calculated using monte - carlo techniques including the initial - state radiation and beamstrahlung effects .",
    "no detector effects or experimental acceptances are taken into account in this study .",
    "the coverage of the @xmath2 parameter space could be improved by running at different center - of - mass energies . here",
    "the following scenarios are considered : ( i ) near the @xmath23-boson threshold with @xmath24 gev and integrated luminosity @xmath25 @xcite , ( ii ) near the @xmath26-quark threshold with @xmath27 gev and @xmath28 @xcite , ( iii ) a base - line high - energy design with @xmath29 gev and @xmath30 @xcite , and ( iv ) an upgraded high - energy version with @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 .    as a starting point ,",
    "the cleanest decay channel , @xmath33 , will be considered .",
    "the presence of a @xmath2 boson would show up as a resonance peak in the @xmath34-pair invariant mass spectrum .",
    "for the detection of a narrow resonance , a good momentum resolution is therefore important . here",
    "the parameters of the tesla study @xcite are taken , which envisages a momentum resolution of @xmath35 in the central tracker region . for a muon pair",
    ", this number needs to be multiplied by two . due to the boost from the initial - state photon ,",
    "the muons are not always produced back - to - back .",
    "therefore a conservative additional factor of two is included to accommodate for possible topological effects .",
    "considering that the maximum energy of the muons is @xmath36 , one obtains for the resolution of the @xmath34-pair invariant mass : @xmath37 to compute the significance of a possible @xmath2 signal , the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath34 pair is divided into bins of the size given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : muenres ] ) . due to the narrow width of weakly coupled @xmath2 boson",
    ", the signal will appear as an excess in a single bin .",
    "the expected signal cross - sections as a function of the @xmath2 mass are exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fg : xsecm ] for a @xmath2 boson with couplings that are 30 times smaller compared to the standard model @xmath3 boson , @xmath38 . in this case",

    "( [ eq : bk ] ) in the given bin .    with luminosities of a few hundred fb@xmath39",
    "one expects signal rates of 100010000 events for the depicted example , with background levels that are about one order of magnitude larger .",
    "the @xmath2 boson is searched for by counting the events in each invariant mass bin and looking for an excess in one bin while vetoing significant deviations from the background expectation in the other bins . in order to determine the statistical significance that the excess in one bin is not a statistical fluctuation ,",
    "a @xmath40 test over all bins is performed .    for a viable event ,",
    "the two muons are required to be in the main region of the detector , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the polar angle of the @xmath43 .",
    "taking into account these constraints , the projected reach of a linear collider for a @xmath2 boson is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : mumu ] .",
    "the results are presented in terms of the product of production cross - section times branching ratio br@xmath44 , normalized to the case where the @xmath2 couplings are identical to the standard model @xmath3 boson .    as evident from the figure , by combining information from the various collider energies , a @xmath2 boson with a signal rate that is",
    "about three orders of magnitude smaller than for a gauge boson with standard model @xmath3 couplings can be found throughout the range 50 gev @xmath45 1 tev , except near the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "the sensitivity can be increased by including other final - state channels . for the @xmath46 channel , a similar sensitivity as for the @xmath47 channel",
    "is expected .",
    "while the @xmath0 channel is plagued by larger background contributions due to t - channel photon or @xmath3-boson exchange , most of this background is peaked in the forward or backward regions of the detector . by restricting the signal to the central detector region , the background levels for the @xmath0 and @xmath47 channel",

    "depending on the branching ratios of the @xmath2 , the inclusion of the decay channels into hadrons , @xmath50 @xmath51 , can lead to stronger limits than the leptonic decay channels . here",
    "only the decays into the five light quark flavors are considered , which are characterized by a two - jet signature .",
    "due to the different decay signature of the top - quark , its contribution would have to be treated separately .",
    "however , a statistical combination with the light - quark channels is only possible using some assumptions about the underlying @xmath2 model and will not be performed here .",

    "it should be noted that besides the possibility to search for @xmath2 boson in the decay channels into charged leptons and quarks , it is also possible to search for `` invisible '' @xmath2 bosons , which primarily decay into neutrinos or other weakly interacting particles .",
