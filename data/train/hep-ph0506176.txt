    "we now study the search potential of the tevatron for the generalized case in the htm where @xmath277 is included , br@xmath278 and @xmath17 are required to reproduce a phenomenologically acceptable neutrino mass matrix .",

    "there are plans to search for the 3 leptonic decays involving @xmath63 ( @xmath299 ) although the discovery reach in @xmath119 is expected to be inferior to that for the @xmath297 channels . in all figures we take @xmath300 . from the figures it is clear that @xmath301 differ considerably in each of the 7 scenarios .",
    "optimal coverage is for cases dg1 and dg4 , which have @xmath302 fb and @xmath303 fb respectively for @xmath114 gev . for nh , @xmath304 fb for @xmath305 gev but @xmath306 and @xmath307",
    "are both unobservable . taking @xmath308 at its largest",
    "experimentally allowed value results in minor changes to all figures , with the most noticeable effect being a significant reduction of @xmath309 in dg4 .",
    "clearly the tevatron run ii not only has strong search potential for @xmath0 , but is also capable of distinguishing between the various allowed scenarios for the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we have studied the production of doubly charged higgs bosons ( @xmath0 ) at hadron colliders in the higgs triplet model ( htm ) , in which a complex @xmath16 scalar triplet is added to the standard model .",
    "the htm can explain the observed neutrino mass matrix by invoking yukawa couplings @xmath17 of the triplet fields to leptons",
    ". a definitive signal of the htm would be the observation of the decay @xmath3 , which enjoys almost negligible background at hadron colliders , and whose branching ratios are correlated with the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "we studied the production mechanism @xmath2 which can be as large as the mechanism @xmath1 assumed in the current searches at the tevatron . since the present search strategy is sensitive to single production of @xmath0 , we advocated the use of the inclusive single production cross - section ( @xmath34 ) when comparing the experimentally excluded region with the theoretical cross - section .",
    "this leads to a strengthening of the mass bound for @xmath119 which now carries a dependence on @xmath188 , and significantly improves the @xmath0 search potential at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "although we performed our numerical analysis in the htm , we emphasized that the introduction of @xmath34 is also relevant for any model which contains a @xmath16 higgs triplet ( e.g. l - r symmetric models and little higgs models ) .",
    "moreover , we quantified the impact of the decay mode @xmath4 for the case of a hierarchical , inverted hierarchical and degenerate neutrino mass spectrum . on discovering a @xmath0 it would be imperative to measure the absolute value of @xmath17 ( and hence @xmath86 ) in order to reconstruct the low energy higgs triplet lagrangian .",
    "we stressed that an order of magnitude estimate of @xmath17 could be obtained if the channel @xmath4 is observed _ and _ @xmath35 is roughly measured .",
    "we encourage a detailed experimental simulation of this decay mode at both the tevatron and lhc .",
