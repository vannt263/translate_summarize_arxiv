    "this paper examines the question of boundary controllability of the non - isentropic euler equation for polytropic compressible fluids in one space dimension , in both eulerian and lagrangian forms .",
    "the two systems under view are the following hyperbolic @xmath1 systems of conservation laws , which in our problem are considered in a space interval @xmath2 .",
    "first , the usual form of the system , in eulerian coordinates , is as follows : @xmath3 in this system , @xmath4 describes the local density of the fluid at time @xmath5 and position @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the local velocity of the fluid , @xmath8 is the pressure . here",
    "@xmath9 is the adiabatic constant .",
    "these three equations describe respectively the conservation of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "in particular the specific total energy @xmath10 of the system is described as @xmath11 the internal energy @xmath12 being connected to the pressure @xmath13 by @xmath14 in lagrangian coordinates , the system is written as follows : @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the specific volume and @xmath12 is consequently written as @xmath17 . this system is obtained from through the change of variable @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a time - dependent path satisfying @xmath20 regular solutions of and of are equivalent through the above change of coordinates , but this turns out to be true even in the case of weak ( entropy ) solutions ( see wagner @xcite ) that are under view in this paper . however the controllability problems described below are different , since they occur in the fixed space domain @xmath2 , with boundary controls .",
    "this domain is not invariant through the change of variables .    of particular importance in the study of compressible fluids",
    "is the physical entropy function . setting without loss of generality the usual coefficient @xmath21 to @xmath22 ,",
    "this function of state reads : @xmath23 regular solutions of and then satisfy respectively the systems @xmath24 and @xmath25 however , in the context of weak entropy solutions , systems and are no longer equivalent to and .       before describing the problem in details ,",
    "let us specify the type of solutions that we consider .",
    "as is well - known , these two systems belong to the class of nonlinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws @xmath26 satisfying the ( strict ) hyperbolicity condition that at each point @xmath27 has @xmath28 distinct real eigenvalues @xmath29 .",
    "these scalar functions are the characteristic speeds at which the system propagates .",
    "it is classical that in such systems , singularities may appear in finite time even if the initial condition is smooth .",
    "hence it is natural from both mathematical and physical viewpoints to consider weak solutions , in which discontinuities such as shock fronts may appear .",
    "but since uniqueness is in general lost at this level of regularity , one has to consider solutions that satisfy additional _",
    "entropy conditions _ aimed at singling out the physically relevant solution .",
    "this paper focuses on _ entropy solutions with bounded variation_. the initial state will be supposed to have small total variation as in the framework of glimm @xcite .",
    "we investigate these two systems from the point of view of control theory , and more precisely we consider the issue of controllability through boundary controls .",
    "this problem is to determine , given an initial state of the system @xmath30 or @xmath31 , which final states @xmath32 can be reached at some time @xmath33 by choosing relevant boundary conditions at @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( given a notion of such boundary conditions ) .",
    "we emphasize that in our problem , boundary conditions on both sides of the domain can be prescribed .",
    "however the question of determining exactly the set of reachable states seems very difficult , since the nature of the system suggests that one has to require additional conditions on @xmath36 for it to be reachable ( this is in particular connected to an effect of these systems known as the _ decay of positive waves _ , see in particular bressan s monograph @xcite . ) here we will concentrate on the question of _ controllability to constant states_. in other words , we aim at proving that given an initial data @xmath37 in some functional class , it is possible to find a solution bringing the state to a constant .",
    "moreover , we would like to focus on the property that the solution should remain _ of small total variation whenever the initial data is of small variation_.      as mentioned before , we consider in this paper weak entropy solutions , which may present discontinuities , in particular shock waves .",
    "let us describe exactly this type of solutions by recalling the basic definitions",
    ".    it will be useful to work with both conservative variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( respectively for systems and ) and primitive variables @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the solutions that we consider will be of bounded variation in space uniformly in time , that is in the space @xmath42 and will not meet the vacuum in the sense that @xmath43 will be strictly separated from @xmath44 ( and @xmath45 bounded ) .",
    "the regularity will be automatically valid for both conservative and primitive variables since @xmath46 is an algebra . using the equation leads to the fact that these solutions have a time - regularity of class @xmath47 .",
    "we will denote @xmath48 the domain where the solutions live .",
    "it is given by @xmath49 for system  , and by @xmath50 for system  . with a slight abuse of notations",
    ", we will write @xmath51 for the conservative variables as well .",
    "now we can consider weak solutions of in the sense of distributions ; but as mentioned before we have to add _ entropy conditions _ to the solution in order to retrieve the correct solution .",
    "first , recall that an entropy / entropy flux couple for a hyperbolic system of conservation laws is defined as a couple of regular functions @xmath52 satisfying : @xmath53 of course @xmath54 are entropy / entropy flux couples .",
    "then we have the following definition :    [ def : solutionentropie ] a function @xmath55 is called an _ entropy solution _ of when , for any entropy / entropy flux couple @xmath56 , with @xmath57 convex , one has in the sense of measures @xmath58 that is , for all @xmath59 with @xmath60 , @xmath61    now we notice that in definition  [ def : solutionentropie ] , we do not mention boundary conditions , which are however of primary importance since they compose the control in our problem .",
    "boundary conditions for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws are a tedious question , especially when considering entropy solutions .",
    "a precise meaning of such boundary conditions can be given , see in particular dubois - lefloch @xcite , sabl - tougeron @xcite and amadori @xcite .",
    "however in order to avoid this issue , we will rephrase the problem into an equivalent one which does not use boundary conditions explicitly .",
    "we fix an initial condition as above , and consider and as under - determined systems ( without boundary conditions )",
    ". the question is to determine for which states @xmath32 there exists _ a solution _ @xmath40 or @xmath41 in @xmath62 , with initial state @xmath37 and with @xmath32 as final state at time @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding boundary values can then be retrieved by taking the corresponding traces at @xmath34 and @xmath35 . at the level of regularity that we consider ,",
    "this is not problematic .",
    "the two results that we establish in this paper are the following .",
    "we begin with the result concerning the system in eulerian coordinates .",
    "[ thmeu1 ] let @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 .",
    "there exists @xmath67 such that for any @xmath68 such that @xmath69 for any @xmath70 with @xmath71 , there exist @xmath33 and a weak entropy solution of system @xmath72;l^{1}(0,l))$ ] such that @xmath73 and @xmath74    our second result concerns the system with lagrangian coordinates .",
    "this result is different from at least two viewpoints : the range of admissible @xmath75 , and the role played by the physical entropy .",
    "[ thmlu1 ] suppose that @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath77 with @xmath78 and let @xmath79 with @xmath80 , such that @xmath81 there exist @xmath82 and @xmath33 such that for any @xmath83 such that @xmath84 there is a weak entropy solution @xmath72;l^{1}(0,l))$ ] of system such that @xmath85 and @xmath86    since @xmath87 is a convex entropy for in the sense of , associated with the entropy flux @xmath88 , the condition is necessary ( or at least , the non - strict inequality is ) .",
    "[ rem : conjecture ] we conjecture the result to be false for @xmath89 in the same spirit as in bressan and coclite s paper @xcite .",
    "see subsection  [ subsec : previousstudies ] below for a brief description of the result of @xcite .    even in the case where @xmath76 , the controllability of system   is surprising , due to the fact that the second characteristic family of the lagrangian system has constant characteristic speed @xmath44 .",
    "of course , this is the worst case scenario for boundary controllability , since this means that there is no propagation from the boundary to the interior of the domain .",
    "hence one has to rely on the interactions of the other characteristic families to act indirectly on the second one .",
    "note that in the context of regular solutions of class @xmath90 , the equivalent result is false , since one can not modify the physical entropy : see .",
    "it is the only example that we know , where there exists a result of boundary controllability in the context of entropy solutions , while the equivalent fails in the @xmath90 framework .",
    "let us say a few words about previous studies on connected subjects .",
    "questions of boundary controllability of one - dimensional hyperbolic systems of conservation laws have been studied in two different frameworks , which give rather different results .",
    "the first one consists in considering _ classical solutions _ of these systems , by which we mean of class @xmath91 \\times [ 0,l])$ ] .",
    "since such systems develop in general singularities in finite time , the solutions which are considered are in general small perturbations in @xmath90 of a constant state , which ensures a sufficient lifetime of the solution for the controllability property to hold .",
    "results of controllability for one - dimensional systems of conservation laws and more generally quasilinear hyperbolic systems in this framework of classical solutions can be traced back to the the pioneering work of cirin @xcite . many results of very general nature have been obtained in this framework since , see in particular li and rao @xcite for an important work on this problem and the more recent monograph by li @xcite .",
    "this framework allows to work with very general hyperbolic systems ( including those in non - conservative form ) , the main condition being that the characteristic speeds are strictly separated from zero , see again @xcite , @xcite and references therein . a result which considers the case of a possibly vanishing ( but not identically vanishing ) characteristic speed is due to coron , wang and the author @xcite ; as we will see , it can be applied to , but not to ; and it considers regular solutions for which the theory is rather different from the one considered here .",
    "the second framework in which the boundary controllability of one - dimensional hyperbolic systems of conservation laws has been studied is the one of _",
    "entropy solutions_. one has to underline that the situation is very different in both contexts , and not a mere difference of regularity .",
    "one of the reasons for that is that systems cease to be _",
    "reversible _ in the context of entropy solutions .",
    "the reversibility or the irreversibility of a system is of central importance in controllability problems .    concerning weak entropy solutions , the study of controllability problems for conservation laws has been initiated by ancona and marson @xcite , in the case of scalar ( @xmath92 ) convex conservation laws . then horsin @xcite obtained further results on burgers equation , by using the _ return method _ , which was introduced by coron in @xcite ( see also coron s book @xcite ) and which is also an important inspiration here . another result in the scalar case was recently obtained by perrollaz @xcite when an additional control appears in the right hand side .    in the case of systems ( @xmath93 ) ,",
    "controllability issues has been first studied by bressan and coclite @xcite . for general strictly hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with genuinely nonlinear or linearly degenerate characteristic fields and characteristic speeds",
    "strictly separated from zero , it is shown that one can drive a small @xmath46 state to a constant state , asymptotically in time , by an open - loop control .",
    "another result in @xcite , especially important for our study , is a negative controllability result in finite time .",
    "this result concerns a class of @xmath94 systems containing the system below ( which was introduced by di perna @xcite ) , and which is close to isentropic dynamics : @xmath95 the authors prove that there are initial conditions , with arbitrarily small total variation , and for which no entropy solution remaining of small total variation for all @xmath96 , reaches a constant state .",
    "an important property of system to establish this result , is that the interaction of two shocks associated to a characteristic family generates a shock in the other family . in particular",
    "this allows to prove that , starting from some initial data having a dense distribution of shocks , this density propagates over time provided that the total variation of the solution remains small .",
    "consequently , the system can not reach a constant state in this case",
    ". however this property is not shared by the actual isentropic euler equation , and this was used by the author in @xcite in order to establish a result on the controllability of this @xmath94 system .",
    "the present paper can be seen as a sequel to @xcite .",
    "note that this property of two shocks of a family generating a shock in the other family is true for the first and third fields of and when @xmath89 ( at least for weak shocks ) , but when @xmath97 such an interaction generates a rarefaction wave in the other family ( see in particular chen , endres and jenssen @xcite ) , a fact which is crucial in the proof of theorem [ thmlu1 ] .",
    "the behaviour for @xmath89 explains our conjecture of remark  [ rem : conjecture ] .",
    "we were not able to prove estimates of decay of positive waves as precise as in @xcite for @xmath1 systems ; hence a generalization of @xcite to system seems difficult for the moment .",
    "other important results in the field are due to ancona and coclite @xcite , in which they investigate the controllability properties for the temple class systems and to ancona and marson @xcite , in which they consider the time asymptotic problem , controlled from only one side of the interval .      the main part of the proof consists in proving the following weaker statements .    [ thme ]",
    "let @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 .",
    "there exist @xmath67 and @xmath33 such that for any @xmath98 satisfying , there exist a state @xmath99 with @xmath100 and a weak entropy solution @xmath72;l^{1}(0,l))$ ] of system satisfying and .",
    "[ thml ] suppose that @xmath76 .",
    "let @xmath66 and @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",

    "when one has succeeded in reaching one constant state , reaching any constant by remaining of small total variation is simple , especially in the case of system , where this can be seen as an immediate consequence of the results @xcite and @xcite concerning the controllability of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in the framework of regular solutions .",
    "system having a characteristic field with constant zero velocity does not enter this framework though , and the proof needs an additional argument ; in particular this is where intervenes .",
    "precisely , we will show the following two statements .",

    "in both cases , we use an idea that was already present in @xcite , that is to use strong discontinuities . by _ strong _ ,",
    "we mean discontinuities that are not intended to be of small amplitude , or to be more accurate that are not _ seen as _ small .",
    "this may seem strange to introduce such material in view of and in theorems  [ thmeu1 ] and [ thmlu1 ] .",
    "in fact , we will use discontinuities that we will consider large during the main part of the proof ; our analysis relies on interaction estimates due to schochet @xcite . only in a final step",
    ", we will explain why these discontinuities can be taken _ not so large _",
    "after all .    in the case of theorem  [ thme ] ,",
    "the construction relies on a contact discontinuity of the second characteristic family , which crosses the domain .",
    "then we use additional waves and cancellation effects to kill the waves inside the domain along this strong discontinuity , so that in the end the state in the domain is constant .    in the case of theorem  [ thml ] ,",
    "the construction relies on two shocks of the first and third characteristic families , which cross the domain one after another . in the case of system",
    ", the second family can not be used , having identically zero characteristic speed .",
    "the first shock is used to filter some waves , so that along the second one one can get rid of the remaining waves , still relying on cancellation effects .",
    "the method that we employ to construct solutions is an adaptation of the _ wave front tracking algorithm _ , inspired in particular by bressan s version of the method @xcite .",
    "it should be underlined that there are other methods to establish the existence of entropy solutions of conservation laws , in particular glimm s random choice method @xcite and the vanishing viscosity method , see the very general result of bianchini and bressan @xcite .",
    "but we have no idea how to use these approaches in the context of controllability problems for conservation laws .",
    "the random choice method can be seen however as a method to discretize the control in some cases where the limit system is known to be controllable , see coron , ervedoza and the author @xcite . in the same spirit",
    ", the question of being able to pass to the vanishing viscosity limit in controllability problems for conservation laws is an active research field , limited for the moment to cases where the limit equation is known from the beginning to be controllable , see in particular @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "in this section , we recall and introduce some general material for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws which is not specific to systems   and . we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic theory of one - dimensional systems of conservation laws ; we refer to bressan @xcite , dafermos @xcite , lax @xcite , lefloch @xcite , serre @xcite or smoller @xcite .",

    "as we explained , the other two cases ( 2 and 4 ) give an @xmath578 depending linearly of @xmath57 .",
    "now the coefficients of interaction with a strong shock corresponding to @xmath1289 are of two types : either coefficients corresponding to standard interaction coefficients ( these are bounded as @xmath1117 tends to zero ) , and those who correspond to the use of proposition  [ pro : cw3j > ] .",
    "the latter coefficients are not bounded as @xmath1117 tends to zero , but it is not difficult to check from that @xmath1289 is of order @xmath1290 . to make the right hand side of less than @xmath57 , one takes @xmath1117 of order @xmath57 and then @xmath578 such that @xmath1291 .",

    ".      * lagrangian case .",
    "* now , for what concerns the lagrangian case , the coefficients corresponding to the use of the two large shocks are of order @xmath1293 , @xmath356 , see propositions  [ pro : corrwlag ] and [ pro : cw3s ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this case we use interactions _ within a family _ to get correction / cancellation waves .",
    "an important fact is that the fronts that are cancelled along the second shock ( that is , the @xmath369-shock ) , have a total variation or order @xmath1294 , not @xmath1295 .",

    "we conclude with an informal discussion about the time of controllability , in particular for small @xmath57 .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath57 is small , it is costly in terms of time of controllability : think for instance about the case where @xmath1299 .",
    "* lagrangian case . *",
    "we begin with the case of system  . in that case , the time of the first phase ( driving @xmath37 to some constant ) is bounded easily using , , and by : @xmath1300 as @xmath57 tends to zero , one can in fact let the `` @xmath1301 '' be closer to @xmath986 ( see , , and ) , and the characteristic speeds above converge to their values at @xmath985 .",
    "it follows that as @xmath1302 , one can estimate the time of this first phase as @xmath1303 in particular , the time of controllability in this first phase is not affected by @xmath57 .",
    "concerning the second phase , that is , driving the constant state @xmath1288 to the final constant state @xmath99 , there are two parts .",
    "the second one consists in using a @xmath90 solution to drive from @xmath1304 to @xmath99 by using a @xmath90 solution of the isentropic equation .",
    "it is not difficult to see that one needs @xmath1305 steps for this ( for instance , one uses rarefaction waves and regular compression waves ) .",
    "the first part is more expensive . indeed , to go from @xmath1288 to @xmath1304 , one uses @xmath28 steps , with @xmath28 defined in .",
    "but one can see that @xmath1306 while - gives a total variation of order @xmath1307 .",
    "it follows that here @xmath1308 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath1302 , @xmath1288 gets closer to @xmath985 , so one can roughly estimate the cost of this second phase as @xmath1309     * eulerian case .",
    "* in the case covered by ( or its vertically symmetric ) the time of controllability to some constant ( that is , of the first phase ) is estimated by .",
    "then we let @xmath653 go to @xmath44 , and as @xmath1302 , the @xmath1301 gets closer to @xmath986 ( see again the definition of @xmath665 in this case ) ; hence one can estimate the time of controllability in this first phase by @xmath1310 in the symmetric case ( case 3 ) , one replaces @xmath1311 with @xmath1312 and puts absolute values on @xmath1229 . in the supersonic case 2 ( resp .",
    "case  4 ) , it is easy to check that @xmath1313 the critical case 5 is more complex .",
    "one can use a @xmath369-wave to shift the characteristic speed @xmath1229 , but as this wave is of order @xmath57 , the resulting @xmath1229 is of order @xmath57 as well ; it follows that in this case the time of the first phase depends on @xmath57 and can be estimated in the rough form @xmath1314 now , concerning the second phase from @xmath1288 to @xmath99 , reasoning as before , one can see that , if there is no critical state ( making a characteristic speed vanish ) on the way , this second phase needs @xmath1315 steps , so @xmath1316 when at some point a characteristic speed @xmath1317 vanishes , we use waves of the other families to drive the state of the system away from the characteristic manifold @xmath1318 .",
    "this costs a time of order @xmath1319 to obtain @xmath1320 .",
    "then one can move in the direction @xmath120 by letting successively @xmath138-rarefaction waves or @xmath138-compression waves cross the domain .",
    "each step in the direction @xmath120 costs @xmath1321 in time for a displacement of order @xmath57 . hence to obtain a displacement of @xmath1322 in this context",
    ", we use a time of @xmath1323 which indicates that it is favorable to take @xmath1324 , and this gives a cost of order @xmath1325 .",
