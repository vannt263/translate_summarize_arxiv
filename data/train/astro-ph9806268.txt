    "it is now well over a decade since coronagraphic imaging of stellar light scattered by a disk around @xmath7 pictoris provided circumstantial evidence for the presence of an extra - solar planetary system ( smith & terrile 1984 ) .",
    "since then , coronagraphic and adaptive - optics ( ao ) searches have continued the quest for additional examples ( smith , fountain , & terrile 1992 ; kalas & jewitt 1995 ) , but none have been successful at imaging light scattered by dust around similar iras - selected candidates ( see table vii from backman & paresce 1993 , for example ) . this failure was originally interpreted to suggest that the disk around @xmath7 pic is highly unusual ( smith et al .",
    "1992 ) , but subsequent identification of a few other main sequence a stars with fractional infrared excesses of the same magnitude has been used to argue that @xmath820% of all a - type stars pass through an early phase like that of @xmath7 pic ( jura et al .",
    "if true , the failure to image other candidates is likely due to their greater distance ; limitations in current coronagraphic techniques would prevent detection of even @xmath7 pic s disk if it were several times farther away ( cf . kalas & jewitt 1996 ) .",
    "an alternate approach is suggested by successful imaging of the thermal dust emission from the disk around @xmath7 pic at mid - infrared wavelengths ( lagage & pantin 1994 ; pantin , lagage , & artymowicz 1997 ) . as part of an effort to take full advantage of this technique , we present thermal infrared imaging of the circumstellar environment of hr 4796 , a more distant a0 star ( houk 1982 ) thought to have a disk similar to that of @xmath7 pic on the basis of its iras excess ( jura 1991 ; jura et al .  1993 ; 1995 ; 1998 ) .    at a distance of 67@xmath63 pc ( @xmath9 = 14.91@xmath60.75 mas ; hipparcos catalog ) , hr 4796 is three and a half times farther away than @xmath7 pic ( d = 19.3@xmath60.2 pc ; @xmath9 = 51.87@xmath60.51 mas ) , but exhibits a strong iras excess with optical depth estimated to be twice as large ( jura 1991 ) .",
    "an m dwarf companion is detected 7.7@xmath10 ( @xmath8 500 au ) from the star and is believed to be physically bound on the basis of common proper motion ( jura et al .",
    "1993 ) . the age of the system is estimated to be @xmath11 = 10 myr on the basis of isochrone fitting ( stauffer et al .",
    "1995 ; jura et al .",
    "1998 ) , in keeping with its identification as an outlying member of the centaurus - lupus association ( jura et al .  1993 ) with average age @xmath11 = 12 - 15 myr ( de geus , de zeeuw , & lub 1989 ) .",
    "this age is younger than other well - known members of the vega class ( @xmath12 myr ) and suggests that hr 4796 may be somewhat transitional between young stars ( @xmath13 myr ) with optically thick disks ( koerner & sargent 1995 ; mannings , koerner , & sargent 1997 ) and `` vega - type '' stars ( cf .",
    "backman & paresce 1993 ) .",
    "we observed hr 4796 with jpl s mid - infrared camera mirlin at the f/40 bent - cassegrain focus of the keck ii telescope on ut 16 march 1998 .",
    "mirlin employs a boeing 128@xmath14128 pixel , high - flux si : as bib detector with a plate scale at keck ii of 0.14@xmath10 per pixel .",
    "the latter was determined by scanning a star across both mirlin s field of view and that of the keck ii guide camera for which the plate scale has been measured .",
    "the associated field of view was 17.5@xmath10 .",
    "background subtraction was carried out by chopping the secondary mirror at a 4 hz rate with 8@xmath10 throw in the north - south direction and by nodding the telescope a similar distance in the east - west direction after coadding a few hundred chop pairs .",
    "observations were carried out in filters centered at @xmath0 = 12.5 , 20.8 , and 24.5 @xmath1 m with widths 1.2 , 1.7 , and 0.8 @xmath1 m and for on - source integration times 6 , 17 , and 6 minutes respectively .",
    "small dither steps were taken between chop - nod cycles .",
    "source images on the double - differenced frames were shifted and added to make the final 64 @xmath14 64 ( 8.3@xmath10 @xmath14 8.3@xmath10 ) images .",
    "infrared standards @xmath15 sco , @xmath16 sco , and @xmath15 lyr were observed in the same way at similar airmasses .",
    "an additional sequence of images was obtained by alternating rapidly between the 12.5 and 20.8 @xmath1 m filters with no telescope offsets in order to accurately register images at both wavelengths .    a two - color rendition of the emission from hr 4796 at @xmath0 = 12.5 and 20.8 @xmath1 m is displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "the underlying images are shown separately in fig .",
    "2a and 2b .",
    "peak 12.5 @xmath1 m emission is compact and centered on an elongated source at 20.8 @xmath1 m . at @xmath0 = 12.5 @xmath1 m ,",
    "peak flux density of 184@xmath618 mjy comprises nearly all of the point - like emission rising above a low - level plateau .",
    "fainter emission accounts for an additional 40 mjy and is slightly extended to the ne and sw .",
    "we estimate the stellar photospheric emission to be 122 mjy at this wavelength by comparison with flux densities for @xmath15 lyr at @xmath17 = 10 @xmath1 m ( tokunaga 1998 ) and assuming similar temperatures , @xmath18 = 5.80 for hr 4796 , and 0.03 for @xmath15 lyr .",
    "this implies a total excess that is nearly equal to the photospheric emission ; half of this arises from very near the star . in the corresponding image at 20.8 @xmath1 m , emission is elongated @xmath83@xmath10 at pa 30@xmath19 with total flux density 1.88@xmath60.2 jy , consistent with the 20 @xmath1 m bolometer measurement of jura et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ( 1.86 jy ) .",
    "measurements at @xmath0 = 24.5 @xmath1 m look roughly similar and have total flux density 2.27@xmath60.7 jy . surprisingly , the center of the 20.8 @xmath1 m structure is not coincident with the peak emission but lies between bright peaks located at each end .",
    "below , we interpret this morphology as arising from a nearly edge - on circumstellar disk with an inner hole and investigate its properties with the aid of a simple model .",
    "our measured flux densities are listed in table i and plotted in figure 3 together with color - corrected iras measurements and an upper limit obtained with the jcmt at @xmath0 = 800 @xmath1 m by jura et al .",
    "the spectral distribution of the flux densities exhibits a nearly black - body shape which peaks at @xmath0 @xmath20 60 @xmath1 m , well away from the maximum stellar photosphere emission .",
    "it can be reproduced by emission from a model disk with mass approximately 1.0 m@xmath21 which is largely devoid of radiating particles inside a radius of a few times 10 au ( jura et al .  1995 ; 1998 ) .",
    "in order to uniquely constrain the spatial distribution of dust , however , it is desirable to gain the maximum amount of information from images which resolve the circumstellar material .",
    "the optically thin radiation from an annulus of width @xmath22 and radius @xmath23 in a flat dusty circumstellar disk is estimated by backman , gillett , & witteborn ( 1992 ) to be @xmath24 \\biggl ( { 2 \\pi r dr \\over d^2 } sr   \\biggr ) jy,\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the geometrical optical depth perpendicular to the disk plane at a fiducial radius @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the particle temperature , @xmath28 is the particle radiative efficiency relative to a black body , and @xmath29 the 67 pc distance to hr 4796 . for a distribution of grains with effective size , @xmath30",
    ", we assume @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 ( see appendix d of backman et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the relation between @xmath30 and a particle size distribution ) .",
    "the grain temperature is then @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the stellar luminosity in solar units .",
    "hr 4796 has a temperature similar to @xmath15 lyr with @xmath18 = 5.80 at d = 67 pc .",
    "then , assuming l@xmath37 = 54 @xmath38 , @xmath18 = 0.03 , and d = 8.1 pc for @xmath15 lyr , we find @xmath36 = 18.1 @xmath39 for hr 4796 .",
    "parameters which remain to be determined include @xmath30 , power - law index of the optical depth @xmath40 , inner and outer radii @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath25 , inclination angle @xmath2 ( from face on ) , and position angle @xmath43 .",
    "the morphology of the 20.8 @xmath1 m emission in fig .",
    "2b provides a useful constraint on @xmath41 , @xmath2 , @xmath43 , and @xmath25 under the assumption of a single power - law structure to the radial optical depth .",
    "however , it does little to constrain @xmath42 , @xmath40 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the latter can be better determined from fits to the flux density distribution , especially if values of the former can be derived from a fit to the image . in both cases ,",
    "we choose to evaluate the uncertainties in the range of acceptable parameter values by calculating the probability of the models given the data .",
    "we use the above formulation to simulate both the image and the flux density distribution and calculate the reduced @xmath44 over the range of parameter values .",
    "the associated probability of the data given the model is taken to be @xmath45 .",
    "the probability of the model given the data is then estimated by summing and normalizing the probabilities over the whole range of parameter space considered .",
    "for the estimate of @xmath2 , individual probabilities are scaled by cos@xmath46 to account for the _ a priori _ expectation that the system is oriented edge on ( see lay et al .",
    "1997 for a more detailed description of this bayesian approach ) .    to simulate the image of hr 4796 at 20.8 @xmath1 m , we calculated the emission from a thin disk as prescribed above at each point of a finely sampled grid ( @xmath47s = 0.015@xmath10 ) and added a flux density corresponding to the stellar photosphere to the central pixel .",
    "the result was binned to the resolution of the observations and convolved with a normalized image of a standard star obtained at similar air mass and within a short time of the hr 4796 observations .",
    "the model image was subtracted from the data to derive reduced @xmath44 and @xmath48 in the usual way .",
    "initial disk parameter values were estimated from the distribution of flux densities in order to determine orientation parameters @xmath2 and @xmath43 .",
    "the most likely values of these were then taken in a second model fit while varying @xmath41 , @xmath25 , and @xmath40 . assuming the best values from the latter , a repeat fit to @xmath2 and @xmath43",
    "was completed as a check .",
    "the final results for @xmath2 and @xmath43 agreed with the initially derived values @xmath2",
    "= @xmath3 and @xmath43 = @xmath4 .    to test for the presence and size of any clearing in the disk",
    ", we considered a range of values for @xmath40 and @xmath25 , since these also affect the radial intensity of emission .",
    "the value of @xmath40 was varied between 0 and -2.5 ; @xmath25 was considered over the range 10@xmath49 .",
    "the appearance of the 20.8 @xmath1 m emission is not sensitive to increases in the choice of outer radii larger than the boundary of emission in the image , since the temperature rapidly decreases to levels at which emission is negligible at that wavelength ; we adopted @xmath42 = 125 au .",
    "the resulting estimate of @xmath41 is evident in the plot in fig .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the source of emission in fig .",
    "2b can not extend inward to within 20 au of the star as an extrapolation of a single power - law profile to the radial optical depth .",
    "in fact , the inner radius of the disk is estimated to be a good deal larger , @xmath41 = 55@xmath615au .",
    "the most probable model is displayed together with the residuals in fig .",
    "2c and 2d .",
    "it is apparent that , although the presence of a hole leads to a good match with the outer disk , some emission close to the star remains in the residual image .",
    "this emission looks similar to the 12.5 @xmath1 m image in appearance and may have a common origin in a warmer population of dust grains near the star with greatly decreased optical depth relative to that of the outer disk .",
    "the unresolved flux density in excess of the stellar photosphere is 62 mjy at @xmath0 = 12.5 @xmath1 m ; excess residual flux density at @xmath0 = 20.8 @xmath1 m is 96 mjy .",
    "these values suggest mean temperatures of 200 - 300 k and associated distances from the star of 3 - 6 au , depending on whether the grains are the same size as in the outer disk or radiate as black bodies .",
    "it holds in either case that the majority of grains giving rise to the emission lie well interior to the 55-au radius of the hole and in a radial zone which corresponds to that of the zodiacal dust in our own solar system .",
    "the properties of the outer disk are best estimated with measurements of the emission at far infrared and millimeter wavelengths which probe cold dust ( cf .",
    "beckwith et al .",
    "1990 ) . assuming an inner radius derived from our fit to the high - resolution 20.8 @xmath1 m image",
    ", we try to estimate these properties with a model of the spectral distribution of flux densities .",
    "in addition to iras fluxes and an upper limit at @xmath0 = 800 @xmath1 m , our measurements in narrow bands at @xmath0 = 12.5 , 20.8 , and 24.5 @xmath1 m provide new constraints on the distribution of material .",
    "our image at 12.5 @xmath1 m demonstrates further that much of the infrared excess at that wavelength does _ not _ arise from the `` disk '' outside @xmath41 = 55 au .",
    "consequently , we do not attempt to fit either that measurement or the iras 12 @xmath1 m flux density .",
    "we varied four parameters , @xmath50 , @xmath40 , @xmath42 , and @xmath30 , over the ranges , 10@xmath51 , -4.5@xmath52 , 56au@xmath53200au , and 10@xmath1m@xmath54 m in a fit to all flux densities at wavelengths longer than 20 @xmath1 m plotted in fig .",
    "flux from the inner region was derived from a fit to the `` point - source '' flux densities at 12.5 and 20.8 @xmath1 m and subtracted ( 89 , 88 , 23 , and 6 mjy at 24.5 , 25 , 60 , and 100 @xmath1 m ) .",
    "the preferred parameter values are @xmath55 au and @xmath56 m ; @xmath50 and @xmath40 are not well determined within these ranges . unless maintained by some orbiting body , an extremely narrow ring is probably too short - lived to be likely .",
    "consequently , we assume @xmath42 = 80 au for the model plotted in fig .  3 , together with @xmath41 = 55 au , @xmath42 = 80 au , @xmath30 = 30 @xmath1 m , @xmath50 = 0.065 and @xmath40 = -2.0 .",
    "these observations provide direct evidence for the existence of a disk around the young a0 star , hr 4796 , with size and orientation that are corroborated by independent observations taken 2 days later ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "further , the morphology of emission at @xmath0 = 20.8 @xmath1 m reveals an inner hole in the disk with radius 55@xmath615 au .",
    "emission in excess above the photosphere at 12.5 @xmath1 m arises predominantly from a region interior to this radius .",
    "when compared to excess 20.8 @xmath1 m emission at this location , the 12.5 @xmath1 m radiation yields a source temperature of a few hundred k , corresponding to a radial distance of a few au from the central star .",
    "the outer and inner components of the dust distribution are analogous , respectively , to the kuiper belt and zodiacal components of dust within our own solar system ( backman et al .",
    "1997 ) . taken together ,",
    "these properties are startlingly like those believed to have existed in the late bombardment stage of the early solar system , when collisions between cometesimals in the outer solar system and between planetesimals or asteroids in a terrestrial planet - forming zone were likely to have generated a large population of smaller dust grains distributed in much the same way as those around hr  4796 .",
