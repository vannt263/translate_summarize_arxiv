    "in recent years there has been a renewed interest in the study of doped transition metal oxides like @xmath1 .",
    "these materials exhibit interesting phenenoma like the correlation induced metal insulator transition .",
    "although there are several experimental data available right now @xcite it is still quite difficult to tackle these substances theoretically .",
    "realistic models have to take into account several bands and are to be explored at finite doping .    the most promising way towards a theoretical description , perhaps , is the limit of large spatial dimensions @xcite , which defines a dynamical mean field theory for the problem .",
    "this limit can be mapped onto an impurity model together with a selfconsistency condition which is characteristic for the specific model under consideration @xcite .",
    "the mapping allows to apply several numerical and analytical techniques which have been developed to analyse impurity models over the years .",
    "there are different approaches which have been used for this purpose : qualitative analysis of the mean field equations @xcite , quantum montecarlo methods @xcite , iterative perturbation theory ( ipt ) @xcite , exact diagonalization methods @xcite , and the projective self - consistent method , a renormalization techique @xcite",
    ". however , each of these methods has its shortfalls .",
    "while quantum montecarlo calculations are not applicable in the zero temperature limit , the exact diagonalization methods and the the projective self consistent method yield only a discrete number of pols for the density of states . moreover , the computational requirements of the exact diagonalization and the quantum montecarlo methods are such that they can only be implemented for the simplest hamiltonians . to carry out realistic calculations",
    "it is necessary to have an accurate but fast algorithm for solving the impurity model . in this context iterative perturbation theory",
    "has turned out to be a useful and reliable tool for the case of half filling @xcite . however , for finite doping the naive extension of the ipt scheme is known to give unphysical results .",
    "there is still no method which can be applied away from half filling and which at the same time is powerful enough to treat more complicated models envolving several bands .",
    "the aim of this paper is to close this gap by introducing a new iterative perturbation scheme which is applicable at arbitrary filling . for simplicity",
    ", we treat the single band case here .",
    "but we believe that the ideas can be generalized to more complicated models involving several bands .",
    "the ( asymmetric ) anderson impurity model @xmath2 describes an impurity @xmath3 coupled to a bath of conduction electrons @xmath4 .",
    "the hybridization function is given by @xmath5 .",
    "once a solution is known for arbitrary parameters a large number of lattice models can be solved by iteration .",
    "an example is the hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath6 which can actually serve as an effective hamiltonian for the description of doped transition metal oxides @xcite . on a bethe lattice with",
    "infinite coordination number @xmath7 the hubbard model is connected to the impurity model by the following selfconsistency condition : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the mapping requires that the propagator of the lattice problem is given by the impurity green function ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "below we set @xmath11 .    in the next section we will derive the perturbation scheme for the impurity model . afterwards",
    "the scheme is applied to the hubbard model ( section [ su3 ] ) .",
    "some results for the doped system are presented and the accuracy of our scheme is discussed .",
    "we conclude with a summary and an outlook on further extensions ( section [ su4 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we derive the approximation scheme which , given the hybridization function @xmath12 and the impurity level @xmath13 , provides a solution of model ( [ eu1 ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that there is no magnetic symmetry breaking ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we also restrict us to zero temperature .",
    "the procedure is an extension of the ordinary ipt scheme to finite doping .",
    "the success of ipt at half filling can be explained by that it becomes exact not only in the weak but also in the strong coupling limit @xcite .",
    "moreover , this approach captures the right low and high frequency behavior so that we are dealing with an interpolation scheme between correct limits .",
    "the idea of our approach is to construct a self energy expression which retains these features at arbitrary doping and reduces at half filling to the ordinary ipt result .",
    "ordinary ipt approximates the self energy by its second order contribution : @xmath15 where @xmath16 with @xmath17 . here ,",
    "the ( advanced ) green function @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 the parameter @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 .",
    "in particular it vanishes at half filling .",
    "the full green function follows from @xmath22    to ensure the correctness of this approximation scheme in different limits , we modify the self energy functional as well as the definition of the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "we start with an ansatz for the self energy : @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the normal second order contribution defined in equation ( [ eu3 ] ) .",
    "we determine the parameter @xmath25 from the condition that the self energy has the exact behavior at high frequencies .",
    "afterwards , @xmath26 is determined from the atomic limit .",
    "the leading behavior for large @xmath27 can be obtained by expanding the green function into a continuous fraction @xcite : @xmath28 . here , @xmath29",
    "marks the @xmath30th order moment of the density of states .",
    "one can compute these quantities by evaluating a commutator ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we obtain for our model @xmath31 .",
    "the leading term of the self energy is therefore given by @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the physical particle number given by @xmath34 .",
    "( [ eu7 ] ) has to be compared with the large frequency limit of ( [ eu3 ] ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a fictitious particle number determined from @xmath37 ( i.  e.  @xmath38 ) . from ( [ eu6 ] ) ,",
    "( [ eu7 ] ) , and ( [ eu8 ] ) we conclude @xmath39 chosing @xmath25 in this way guaranties that our self energy is correct to order @xmath40 .",
    "it should be noted from the continuous fraction considered above that consequently the moments of the density of states up to second order are reproduced exactly .",
    "next , we have to fix @xmath26 .",
    "the exact impurity green function for @xmath41 is given by @xcite @xmath42 this can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 this expression is to be compared with the atomic limit of our ansatz ( [ eu6 ] ) . since @xmath45 , we obtain @xmath46    thus , the final result for our interpolating self energy is @xmath47    yet , @xmath20 is still a free parameter .",
    "we fix it imposing the friedel sum rule @xcite : @xmath48 this statement , which is equivalent to the luttinger theorem @xcite @xmath49 , should be viewed as a condition on the zero frequency value of the self energy to obtain the correct low energy behavior .",
    "the use of the friedel sum rule is the main difference to an earlier approximation scheme @xcite and is essential to obtain a good agreement with the exact diagonalization method .",
    "so far , we considered three different limits : strong coupling , zero frequency and large frequency .",
    "it remains to check the weak coupling limit .",
    "taking into account that @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 , it follows that ( [ eu12 ] ) is indeed exact to order @xmath53 .",
    "the actual solution of the impurity model is determined by a pair ( @xmath20 , @xmath33 ) which satisfies equations ( [ eu3 ] ) , ( [ eu4 ] ) , ( [ eu5 ] ) , ( [ eu12 ] ) , and ( [ eu13 ] ) .",
    "for the numerical implementation broyden s method @xcite , a generalization of newton s method , has turned out to be very powerful . defining two functions @xmath54(\\omega)$ ] and",
    "@xmath55 $ ] the impurity problem can be solved by searching for the zeros of @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is the particle number determined from the friedel sum rule ) .",
    "the algorithm is very efficient as in most cases a solution is found within 4 to 10 iterations .",
    "after treating the anderson impurity model , we now apply the perturbation scheme to the solution of the hubbard model . starting with a guess for @xmath12 one",
    "can solve the impurity model using the scheme described above .",
    "this yields a propagator @xmath59 , which can be used to determine a new hybridization function @xmath12 according to ( [ ue20 ] ) .",
    "the iteration is continued until convergence is attained .",
    "it is most accurate to perform the calculation first on the imaginary axis .",
    "once the constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the interpolating self energy are determined in this way , they can be used to perform the iteration on the real axis .    in the case of the hubbard model ,",
    "the luttinger theorem takes the simple form @xcite @xmath60 this can be used to simplify the selfconsistency procedure if @xmath20 rather than @xmath61 is fixed . starting with a guess for @xmath62 and @xmath61 , one can compute @xmath37 , @xmath33 , and @xmath36 . afterwards ( [ eu12 ] ) yields @xmath63 and a new @xmath61 is obtained from ( [ ue21 ] ) .    to illustrate the accuracy of our method we compare it with results obtained using the exact diagonalization algorithm of caffarel and krauth @xcite .",
    "both methods are in close agreement when used on the imaginary axis ( see figure [ fig_compi ] ) .",
    "the real advantage of our perturbation scheme compared to the exact diagonalization is disclosed when we display the spectral functions obtained by these two methods on the real axis ( figure  [ fig_comp ] ) .",
    "= 2.8truein    = 2.8truein    it is clear that the exact diagonalization is doing its best in producing the correct spectral distribution .",
    "but it is unable to give a smooth density of states .",
    "instead several sharp structures occur as a consequence of treating only a finite number of orbitals in the anderson model .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the evolution of the spectral density of the doped mott insulator ( @xmath64 ) with increasing hole doping @xmath65 .",
    "the qualitative features are those expected from the spectra of the single impurity @xcite and are in agreement with the quantum montecarlo calculations @xcite . for small doping",
    "there is a clear resonance peak at the fermi level . as @xmath65 is increased , the peak broadens and is shifted through the lower hubbard band . at the same time the weight of the upper band decreases .",
    "the most striking feature of the evolution of the spectral density as a function of doping is the finite shift of the kondo resonance from the insulating band edge as the doping goes to zero .",
    "it was demonstrated analytically that this is a genuine property of the exact solution of the hubbard model in infinite dimensions using the projective self - consistent method @xcite and is one of the most striking properties of the hubbard model in large dimensions .",
    "this feature did not appear in the earlier studies of hubbard model in large dimensions using montecarlo techniques @xcite at higher temperatures , and is also not easily seen in exact diagonalization algorithms @xcite .",
    "in this paper we introduced a new perturbation scheme for the solution of lattice models away from half filling .",
    "the basic idea is to construct an expression for the self energy which interpolates between correct limits . in the weak coupling limit",
    "our approximate self energy is exact to order @xmath53 , and it is also exact in the atomic limit .",
    "the proper low frequency behavior is ensured by the friedel sum rule ( or , equivalently , the luttinger theorem ) .",
    "this is important to obtain the right low energy features in the spectral density .",
    "the overall distribution of the density of states on the other hand is determined by the spectral moments , which are reproduced exactly up to second order by satisfying the proper large frequency behavior . in the light of these features",
    "it might not be too astonishing that we obtain a good agreement with the exact diagonalization method .",
    "since the algorithm decribed here is accurate and very fast ( a typical run to solve the hubbard model takes 60 seconds on a dec alpha station 200 4/233 ) it has a wide range of applications .",
    "two examples that come to mind are the effects of disorder on the hubbard model away from half filling and the study of realistic models with orbital degeneracy .",
    "the latter is very important to make contact with realistic three dimensional transition metal oxides .",
