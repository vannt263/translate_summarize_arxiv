    "one of the hard problems in non - perturbative quantum gravity @xcite is to construct a full set of physically meaningful observable quantities @xcite . in this paper , we point out that there is a natural set of quantities that one can define in quantum general relativity , which are gauge invariant , have a natural physical interpretation , and could play the role played by the @xmath1-point functions in quantum field theory .",
    "we denote these quantity as @xmath0 functions , or @xmath1-net functions . as the @xmath1-point functions in a quantum field theory ,",
    "these quantities are not natural quantities of the corresponding classical field theory , namely in general relativity .",
    "nevertheless , they capture the physical content of the quantum theory and are related to the classical theory .",
    "the @xmath0 functions are strictly related to the three - geometry to three - geometry transition amplitude studied by hawking @xcite .",
    "however , they are not transition amplitudes between states in which the classical three - geometry has an arbitrary sharp value , but rather transition amplitudes between _ eigenstates _ of the three - geometry . in loop",
    "quantum gravity @xcite , these eigenstates are characterized by discretized geometries and are labelled by abstract spin networks @xcite , or @xmath2-knots .",
    "thus the @xmath0 functions are rather transition amplitudes between states with fixed amounts of `` quanta of geometry '' .",
    "this is analogous to the @xmath1-point functions in field theory , which are not transition amplitudes between field configurations , but rather transition amplitudes between states characterized by a fixed number of `` quanta of field ''  that is , particles .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 functions generalize the three - geometry to three - geometry amplitude ( a 2-point function ) to arbitrary @xmath1-point functions ; more precisely , we define the @xmath0 functions as a functional @xmath3 over an _ algebra _",
    "@xmath4 of abstract ( not necessarily connected ) spin networks . in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath0 functions are analogous to the wightman distributions @xcite ( hence the choice of the letter @xmath0 ) .",
    "we start from a general definition of the @xmath0 functions , based on canonical quantum gravity .",
    "we show that the @xmath0 functions are well defined diffeomorphism invariant observable quantities and we clarify their physical interpretation . in this paper",
    "we focus on the case in which the dynamics is `` real '' , in a sense defined below .",
    "the physical meaning of this reality and the extension of the formalism to the general case are discussed at the end of the paper .",
    "a crucial property of the wightman functions is the possibility of reconstructing the quantum field theory from them  a subtle application of the beautiful gelfand - naimark - segel ( gns ) representation theorem in the theory of @xmath5 algebras .",
    "we show here that the @xmath0 functions have the same property : under appropriate conditions in particular , a positivity condition the physical hilbert space of the theory and a suitable operator algebra can can be reconstructed from the @xmath0 functions , using the gns construction . in other words ,",
    "we explore the extension to the generally covariant context of wightman s remarkable intuition that the content of a quantum field theory is coded in its @xmath1-point functions . to this aim",
    ", we need to strip wightman s theory from all the `` details '' that follow from the existence of a background minkowski space ( positivity of the energy , uniqueness of the vacuum , micro - locality  ) and show that the core idea remains valid even in the absence of a background spacetime . for a line of investigation similar in spirit ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "since the diffeomorphism invariant quantum field theory can be characterized by its @xmath0 functions , the way is open for defining a quantum theory of gravity by directly constructing its @xmath0 functions .",
    "remarkably , spin foam models @xcite provide a natural perturbative definition of @xmath0 functions .",
    "in particular , it has been recently shown that general spin foam models can be obtained as the feynman expansion of certain peculiar field theories over a group @xcite .",
    "we show here that the gauge invariant @xmath1-point functions of these field theories are precisely @xmath0 functions .",
    "this construction provides a direct link between the field theoretical formulation of the spin foam models and canonical quantum gravity .",
    "the link is similar in spirit to the link between the operator definition quantum field theory and the construction of its @xmath1-point functions via a functional integral @xcite . in particular , given the field theoretical formulation of a spin foam model , we can construct a quantum gravity physical hilbert space of from its @xmath0 functions . on the one hand , loop quantum gravity provides the general framework and , in particular , the physical interpretation of the @xmath0 functions ; on the other hand , the field theory over the group provides an indirect but complete definition of the dynamics .",
    "this is especially interesting on the light , in particular , of the recent construction of _ lorentzian _ spin foam models @xcite . in turn",
    ", the perturbative expansion of the field theory defines a sum over spinfoams which can be directly interpreted as a sum over 4-geometries formulation of quantum gravity .",
    "a very interesting paper by alexandar mikovic @xcite has recently appeared , in which some of the idea presented here are independently derived .",
    "we present some comments on the relation between the two approaches in the conclusion section .",
    "we give an example of reconstruction in section [ free ] .",
    "we consider a simple `` free '' model , obtained by dropping the interaction term which gives the quantum gravity vertex .",
    "we prove positivity for this case , and thus the existence of a hilbert space of spin networks for this quantum theory .",
    "finally , in section [ openissues ] we discuss the meaning of the reality assumption and the extension to the complex case .",
    "all together , we obtain an attracting unified picture , in which canonical loop quantum gravity , covariant spin foam models , and a family of diffeomorphism invariant physical observables for quantum gravity fit into a unified scheme .",
    "the ideas described in this paper have been first presented in the second conference on quantum gravity in warsaw , in june 1999 .",
    "in loop quantum gravity @xcite , the hilbert space @xmath7 of the states invariant under three - dimensional diffeomorphisms admits a discrete @xcite basis of states @xmath8 , labelled by abstract spin networks ( or @xmath2-knots ) @xmath2 .",
    "an abstract spin network @xmath2 is an abstract graph ( not necessarily connected ) @xmath9 , with links labelled by @xmath10 representations and nodes labelled by @xmath10 intertwiners ( and satisfying suitable conditions @xcite ) .",
    "there is a natural union operation @xmath11 defined on the abstract spin networks : @xmath12 is the spin network defined by the the graph formed by the two disconnected components @xmath9 and @xmath13 .",
    "notice that the relation between @xmath14 and the extended hilbert space @xmath15 formed by the unconstrained states @xcite can be expressed in terms of a  projection \" operator @xmath16 which sends an embedded spin network state of a suitable basis of @xmath15 into a an abstract spin network state , or @xmath2-knot , in @xmath14 @xcite . due to the infinite volume of the group of the diffeomorphisms ( or to the fact that the zero eigenvalue of the diffeomorphism constraint is in the continuum spectrum )",
    "@xmath7 is not a proper subspace of @xmath15 and @xmath17 is not a true projection operator ( hence the quotation marks ) , but many alternative techniques for taking care of these technicalities are known , and the space @xmath14 and the operator @xmath17 are nevertheless well defined .",
    "the states @xmath8 have a straightforward physical interpretation , which follows from the fact that they are projections on @xmath7 of eigenstates of the area and volume operators @xcite .",
    "the interpretation is the following .",
    "a state @xmath8 represents a three - geometry .",
    "a three - geometry is an equivalence class of three - metrics under diffeomorphisms .",
    "the geometry represented by @xmath8 is quantized , in the sense that it is formed by regions and surfaces having quantized values of volume and area .",
    "intuitively , each node of @xmath2 represents a `` chunk '' of space , whose ( quantized ) volume is determined by the intertwiner associated to the node .",
    "two of such chunks of space are adjacent if there is a link between the corresponding nodes .",
    "the ( quantized ) area of the surface that separates them is determined by the representation @xmath18 associated to this link , according to the now well known relation @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the reduced planck constant , the newton constant and the immirzi parameter ( the dimensionless free parameter in the theory ) .",
    "this interpretation of the states @xmath8 follows from the study of the area and volume operator on the hilbert space of the non - diffeomorphism invariant states .",
    "notice that the states @xmath8 are not gauge invariant either , and do not represent physical gauge invariant notions .",
    "the same is true for the corresponding classical notion of three - geometry : a three - geometry is determined by an adm surface , which is a non - gauge - invariant notion in general relativity .",
    "the dynamics of the theory is given by the hamiltonian constraint @xmath21 , which we assume here to be a symmetric operator .",
    "the space of the solutions of this constraint is the physical hilbert space of the theory @xmath22 . instead of using the hamiltonian constraint",
    ", we can work with the linear operator @xmath23 that projects on the kernel of @xmath21 .",
    "( a suitable extension of @xmath24 to its generalized states or any other of the many techniques developed for this purpose should be used in order to take care of the technical complications in defining the hilbert eigenspace corresponding to an eigenvalue in the continuum spectrum . ) for more details on this operator , and , in particular , a more precise definition as a three - diffeomorphism invariant object , see @xcite . instead of worrying about the explicit construction of @xmath25 ,",
    "we assume here that the operator @xmath23 is given , and we consider the quantity @xmath26 we claim that this is a well - defined fully gauge invariant quantity , which represents a physical observable in quantum gravity and has a precise and well - understood physical interpretation .",
    "the gauge invariance of @xmath6 is immediate .",
    "all the objects on the r.h.s.of ( [ eq : w2 ] ) are invariant under three - dimensional diffeomorphisms , therefore we need to check only invariance under time reparametrizations .",
    "an infinitesimal coordinate - time shift is generated by the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "if we gauge transform ( say ) the bra state @xmath27 we obtain @xmath28 because @xmath25 is precisely the projector on the kernel of @xmath29 .",
    "therefore @xmath6 represents a gauge - invariant transition amplitude .",
    "in fact , this is precisely the physical three - geometry to three - geometry physical transition amplitude .    to clarify why the three - geometry to three - geometry transition amplitude is a physical gauge - invariant quantity , consider a simple analogy with a well known system .",
    "consider a free relativistic particle in three spatial dimensions .",
    "its physical description is given by its position @xmath30 at each time @xmath31 .",
    "to have explicit lorentz invariance in the formalism , the dynamics can be represented as a constrained reparametrization invariant dynamical system , by promoting the time variable @xmath31 to the role of dynamical variable @xmath32 , and introducing an unphysical parameter `` time '' @xmath33 .",
    "the dynamics is then entirely determined by the constraints @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding constraints in the quantum theory are the klein gordon equation and the restriction to its positive frequency solutions .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath36 of the unconstrained states is formed by the square integrable functions on minkowski space . the physical hilbert space @xmath37 of the physical states is formed by the positive frequency solutions of the klein gordon equation .",
    "there is a well defined projection operator @xmath25 , which restricts any state in @xmath37 ( more precisely , in the extension of @xmath37 which includes its generalized states ) to its mass shell , positive frequency , component .",
    "now , consider the ( generalized ) state @xmath38 in @xmath39 .",
    "this is the eigenstate of both the position @xmath40 and the time @xmath41 operators , which are well defined self - adjoint operators on @xmath39 .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath38 is clear : it is a particle at the minkowski spacetime point @xmath42 . on the other hand , this is clearly _ not _ a physical state : there is no physical particle that can `` stay '' in a single point of spacetime ( where is it after a second ? ) .",
    "it is a state that does not satisfies the dynamics .",
    "notice also that in @xmath39 two such states at two different points of minkowski space are orthogonal .",
    "however , given the state @xmath43 in @xmath39 , we can project it down to @xmath44 and define the _ physical _ state @xmath45 in momentum space , this amounts to restrict it to its mass shell positive frequency components . in coordinate space , this amount to spread out the delta function to a full solution of the klein gordon equation , which as its happens at time @xmath41 is concentrated around @xmath40 , but at other times is spread around the future and past light cones of @xmath46 . the state @xmath47 is a physical state , and has a physical interpretation consistent with the dynamics : it is a ( heisenberg ) state in which the particle is in @xmath40 at time @xmath41 , and has appropriately moved around in space at other times .",
    "the transition amplitude between two such states is a physically meaningful quantity .",
    "indeed , it is nothing else that the familiar propagator in minkowski space .",
    "but notice that @xmath48 namely the propagator is nothing but the matrix element of the projector operator @xmath25 between the _ unphysical _ states @xmath38 !    it is clear that the structure illustrated is the precisely the same as in quantum gravity .",
    "a classical three - geometry is determined by three degrees of freedom per space point .",
    "two of these correspond to physical degrees of freedom of the gravitational field , in analogy with the dependent variable @xmath40 above .",
    "the third is the independent temporal variable , in analogy with the @xmath41 variable in the example above .",
    "therefore @xmath2 , precisely as @xmath49 includes the dependent as well as the independent ( time ) variables .",
    "the states @xmath8 are quantum states concentrated at a single three - geometry .",
    "precisely as the states @xmath50 , these are unphysical , because spacetime can not be concentrated on a unique three - geometry , in the very same sense in which a particle can not be at a unique point of minkowski space . the projector @xmath25 project a state @xmath8 into a physical state which spreads across three - geometries , and the transition amplitude ( [ eq : w2 ] )",
    "gives the amplitude of measuring the three - geometry corresponding to @xmath2 after we have measured the three geometry corresponding to @xmath51 .",
    "this amplitude is well defined and diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "let us now return to the gravitational theory .",
    "we assume in this section that @xmath25 has the following property , which we call ( for reason that will become clear later on ) `` reality '' @xmath52 the physical meaning of this property , as well as the extension of the formalism to the case in which this property does not hold are discussed in section [ openissues ] .",
    "consider the vector in @xmath53 @xmath54 and , in general , @xmath55 ( see the particle analogy discussed at the end of last section . ) the 2-net function @xmath6 , defined in ( [ eq : w2 ] ) , can then be written also as @xmath56 clearly the states @xmath57 form an overcomplete basis of @xmath53 . in particular , there will be relations between them , of the form @xmath58 for appropriate complex numbers @xmath59 .",
    "notice that ( [ eq : linearrel ] ) is equivalent to @xmath60 , or @xmath61 .",
    "this can also be rewritten as @xmath62 and , because of the reality ( [ eq : reality ] ) of @xmath25 , as @xmath63 .",
    "therefore @xmath64 for all @xmath65 , whenever ( [ eq : linearrel ] ) holds .",
    "using this fact , we define on @xmath53 the operator @xmath66 this definition is well posed , in spite of the overcompleteness of the vectors @xmath67 , because of ( [ eq : linearrel2 ] ) , that is , @xmath68 sends the vanishing linear combinations ( [ eq : linearrel ] ) of states into the linear combinations ( [ eq : linearrel2 ] ) which are still vanishing .",
    "also , notice that @xmath69 is self - adjoint , again because of the reality of @xmath25 @xmath70 and it commutes with itself @xmath71=0 ,      \\label{eq : commutativity}\\ ] ] since @xmath72    the 2-net function @xmath6 , defined in ( [ eq : w2 ] ) , can be written now as @xmath73 more in general , we can define @xmath74 so that @xmath75    now , consider the free linear space @xmath4 formed by the ( formal ) linear combinations of spin networks , with complex coefficients @xmath76 there is a natural product defined on @xmath4 by @xmath77 , and a natural star operation defined by @xmath78 ( here we refer to spin networks labeled by @xmath10 representations and each representation of @xmath10 is conjugate to itself .",
    "when spin networks are labeled by representations of groups which are not self - conjugate the star operation should replaces representations with dual representations . )",
    "we define the norm @xmath79 .",
    "we obtain in this way a @xmath5 algebra structure on @xmath4 .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 , defined in ( [ eq : w ] ) , defines a linear functional on @xmath4 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that the functional is positive @xmath80 we can thus apply the gelfand - naimark - segal construction to the @xmath81algebra @xmath4 and the positive linear functional @xmath0 , obtaining a hilbert space @xmath82 , a `` vacuum '' state @xmath83 and a representation @xmath84 of @xmath4 in the hilbert space , such that @xmath85 but it is clear that in doing so we have simply reconstructed the hilbert space @xmath53 , the `` vacuum '' state @xmath86 and the algebra of the operators @xmath69 . in other words ,",
    "the content of the canonical theory of quantum gravity can be coded , in the spirit of wightman , in the positive linear functional @xmath3 over the algebra @xmath4 of the spin networks .",
    "we can thus determine the dynamics of the theory by giving @xmath3 , instead of explicitly giving the projector @xmath25 , or the hamiltonian constraint , and reconstruct the physical hilbert space from @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , the main physical gauge - invariant observable , namely the three - geometry to three - geometry transition amplitude is simply the value of @xmath3 on the spin networks @xmath2 formed by two disjoint components .",
    "we close this section with a comment about locality .",
    "the sense in which general relativity is a local theory is far more subtle that in ordinary field theory . for a detailed discussion of this issue see for instance @xcite . in particular ,",
    "physical gauge invariant observables are independent from the spacetime coordinates @xmath87 , and therefore they are not localized on the spacetime manifold , which is coordinatized by @xmath87 .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamics of general relativity is still local in an appropriate sense .",
    "this locality should be reflected in a general property of the @xmath0 functions .",
    "roughly , we expect that if a spin network @xmath2 can be cut in two parts ( connected to each each other ) @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and a second spin network @xmath51 can be cut in two parts ( connected to each each other ) @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and if @xmath92 , then @xmath6 should be independent from @xmath88 .",
    "in other words , the local evolution in apart of the spin network should be independent from what happens elsewhere on the spin network . a precisely formulation of this property and its consequences deserve to be studied .",
    "in the last few years , intriguing developments in quantum gravity have been obtained using the spin foam @xcite formalism .",
    "recently , it has been shown that any spin foam model can be derived from an auxiliary field theory over a group manifold @xcite .",
    "several spin foam models defined from auxiliary theories defined over a group have been developed .",
    "they are covariant , have remarkable finiteness properties @xcite , exist in lorentzian form @xcite and represent intriguing covariant models for a quantum theory of the gravitational field . in this section ,",
    "we illustrate the emergence of a @xmath3 functional over @xmath4 in the context of these field theories over a group manifolds . for a similar derivation see @xcite .    for concreteness , and simplicity of the presentation ,",
    "let us consider a specific model .",
    "consider a real field theory for a scalar field defined over a group manifold @xmath93 , where @xmath94 , which we chose for the moment to be a compact lie group @xcite .",
    "the field @xmath95 is defined to be symmetric under permutation of its four arguments and @xmath96 invariant in the sense that it satisfies @xmath97 , where the operator @xmath98 is defined by @xmath99 the dynamics is given by an action @xmath100 $ ] , which we do not specify for the moment .",
    "the @xmath1-point functions of the theory have the form @xmath101\\ \\phi(g^{i_{1}}_{1 } ) , \\ldots , \\phi(g^{i_{n}}_{n})\\ e^{is[\\phi]}.\\ ] ] let us work in momentum space .",
    "using peter - weyl theorem , we expand the field in terms of the matrix elements of the irreducible representations @xmath102 of @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath103 we denote as @xmath104 a normalized basis in the space of the intertwiners between the representations @xmath105 . imposing the @xmath96 invariance of the field on the momentum space components , and using the relation @xmath106",
    "we can write the field as @xmath107 or , defining ( for later convenience ) @xmath108 as @xmath109 we can take the quantities @xmath110 as the independent `` fourier components '' of the field , and therefore write the @xmath0 functions , in momentum space as @xmath111\\ \\phi^{\\alpha^{1}_1\\alpha^{1}_2\\alpha^{1}_3\\alpha^{1}_4}_{{\\scriptscriptstyle}n^{1}_1n^{1}_2n^{1}_3n^{1}_4,\\lambda^{1 } }   \\ldots \\phi^{\\alpha^{n}_1\\alpha^{n}_2\\alpha^{n}_3\\alpha^{n}_4}_{{\\scriptscriptstyle}n^{n}_1n^{n}_2n^{n}_3n^{n}_4,\\lambda^{n } }   \\ \\   e^{is[\\phi]}.\\ ] ] however , the measure and the action are @xmath96 invariant . therefore the only nontrivial independent @xmath0 functions are given by @xmath96 invariant combinations of fields , where @xmath96 acts on each index @xmath112 by the representation @xmath113 .",
    "there is only one way of obtaining @xmath96 singlets : to have the indices @xmath112 all paired with the two indices of the pair sitting in the same representation and to sum over the paired indices .",
    "each independent @xmath0 function is determined by a choice of indices and their pairing .    in order to describe these index choices and pairings ,",
    "let us associate to each field @xmath114 in the integrand a four valent node ; we associate to this node the intertwiner @xmath115 , and to each of its four links a representation @xmath116 .",
    "we then connect the links between two fields with paired indices .",
    "we obtain a graph , with nodes labelled by intertwiners and links labelled by representations ( satisfying clebsch - gordan like relations ) , namely a spin network @xmath2 ( in the group @xmath96 ) .",

    "if @xmath3 is positive , we have then immediately , thanks to the gns theorem , a hilbert space and an algebra of field operators whose vacuum expectation value is @xmath3 . under suitable conditions ,",
    "this could be identified with the physical hilbert space of quantum gravity . for this",
    ", the group @xmath96 has to be @xmath10 , or , alternatively , the representations and the intertwiners should be in correspondence with the ones of @xmath10 .",
    "this is the case in particular for the gravitational @xmath124 and @xmath125 models @xcite in which the dynamics restricts the representations to the simple , or balanced , representations , which can be identified with the irreducible @xmath10 representations .",
    "the relation between the field theory and quantum gravity becomes much more transparent by expressing @xmath3 explicitly as a perturbation expansion .",
    "indeed , as shown in ref.@xcite , the standard field theoretical perturbation expansion of @xmath3 in feynman graphs turns out to be a sum over spin foams . in particular @xmath126",

    "then the reality of @xmath25 is expressed by the equation in figure 3 .",
    "that is , it represents an a priori indistinguibility between past and future boundaries of spacetime .",
    "this property is strictly connected with crossing symmetry @xcite , which is essentially the analogous property at the level of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the property is natural from the perspective of atiyah s topological quantum field theory axiomatic framework @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps natural to expect this property for euclidean quantum gravity .",
    "wether we should expect lorentzian quantum gravity to have the same property , on the other hand , is not clear to us . on the one hand , the causal structure of the lorentzian four - geometries seems to suggest that one should distinguish past and future boundaries .",
    "notice also that ( [ eq : reality ] ) implies that the transition amplitudes @xmath6 are real , because @xmath168 which would prevent quantum mechanical interference between the @xmath169 basis states ( but not between generic states ) . on the other hand , however , temporal relations between boundaries may be induced a posteriori by the dynamics , instead of being a priori given in the structure of the formalism itself .",
    "if we drop the reality condition on @xmath25 , the main difficulty is that the definition ( [ phifull ] ) of the field operator becomes inconsistent .",
    "however , can still retain a ( partial ) characterization of the field operator @xmath68 by requiring only @xmath170 this is certainly consistent .",
    "notice that in general we have then @xmath171 and the 2-net function is now given by @xmath172 that is , we have to add the adjoint operation to equation ( [ nostar ] ) .",
    "the relevant abstract @xmath5-algebra has now a non trivial star operation , different from @xmath78 . if @xmath173 and @xmath174 are independent , the @xmath5-algebra is generated by products of @xmath2 s and @xmath175 s , and @xmath176    starting from the field theory , we may generate a @xmath0 functional on the complex algebra @xmath4 by using a complex field , instead than a real one .",
    "the resulting structure will be explored in detail elsewhere .",
    "a strictly related problem is whether the @xmath1-net @xmath0 functions should be thought as analogous to the wightman distributions ( the vacuum expectation values of products of field operators ) , to the feynman distributions ( the vacuum expectation values of time ordered products of field operators ) or rather to the schwinger functions ( the appropriate analytic continuations of the wightman distributions to imaginary time ) .",
    "we recall that on minkowski space one can directly apply the gns reconstruction theorem to the wightman distributions . on the other hand ,",
    "one obtains directly the feynman distributions as functional integrals of products of fields ( with suitable `` prescriptions '' at the poles ) , while one can obtain the schwinger functions as momenta of a well defined stochastic process @xcite .",
    "the osterwalder - schrader reconstruction theorem @xcite that allows the reconstruction of the wightman distributions from the schwinger functions requires a duality `` star '' operation to be defined , corresponding to the inversion of the time variable . presumably , the distinction between these different families of @xmath1-point functions makes no sense in the generally covariant context .",
    "the peculiar analytic structure of the @xmath1-point functions of field theory on minkowski space is a consequence of the positivity of the energy ( the fourier transform of a function with support on positive numbers is analytic in the upper complex plane . ) , while there is no notion of positivity of the energy in quantum gravity  indeed , there is no notion of energy at all , and one should be careful in trying to generalize standard quantum field theoretical prejudices to the generally covariant context .",
    "we have studied the family of quantities @xmath3 , which we propose as main physical observables of a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "we have proposed a general framework , based on these quantities , that ties the canonical ( loop ) and the covariant ( spin foam ) approaches to quantum gravity .",
    "the connection between the two formalisms is provided by the gns reconstruction theorem , and parallels the connection between the hilbert space and the functional formulations of conventional quantum field theory , which one obtains from the properties of the @xmath1-point functions .",
    "many issues deserve to be clarified . among these",
    "are the reality of @xmath25 and the complex @xmath4 algebra ; the locality property of @xmath3 mentioned at the end of section [ wfunctions ] ; and the connection between @xmath3 and the @xmath177 matrix when spacetime admits asymptotic regions .",
    "an explicit construction of the @xmath81 algebra and the its gns construction in the case of the 2 dimensional theory @xcite would also be of great interest and presumably not too hard to do .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", an independent but related approach has recently appeared in ref .",
    "@xcite by alexandar mikovic .",
    "mikovic studies the field theories of a group , and constructs a the hilbert space of the theory in fact , a fock space directly from the theory s field operators , instead of using the intermediary step of the transition functions as we do here .",
    "he observes , as we do here , that this hilbert space has a natural basis of spin network states , where the spin network correspond to a triangulation of the spacetime boundary , and that in perturbation theory the transition amplitudes between spin network amplitudes are given by the state - sum amplitudes for triangulated manifolds with boundaries .",
    "this structure parallels what is done here",
    ". it may be useful on the other hand , to emphasize a difference in attitude : mikovic sees the discrete aspects of the geometry as a starting postulate ; here , on the contrary , we view them as a result of the canonical quantization of the continuum theory .",
    "in addition , mikovic considers evolution in a fixed number of simplices , and proposes to interpret the number of simplices between two spin networks as a time parameter .",
    "transition amplitudes in this time are then finite . the same idea of fixing the number of planck steps to get a",
    "time variable and finite transition amplitudes has been explored by markopoulou and smolin @xcite , and can be traced to sorkin s suggestion of using the 4d volume as a natural time variable @xcite .",
    "see also teitelboim s @xcite .",
    "the resulting transition amplitudes are analogous to feynman s proper time propagator @xmath178 obtained integrating over all paths in minkowski space that go from @xmath179 to @xmath180 in the proper time @xmath33 .",
    "the physical propagator @xmath181 is obtained from @xmath178 by integrating over @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , it is this integration that amounts to impose the hamiltonian constraint . as far as we understand",
    ", the unintegrated proper time propagator does not have a simple physical interpretation in the context of the dynamics of the particle .",
    "the analogy suggests that in the gravitational context we can not confine ourselves to the transition amplitudes in a fixed number of planck steps , but the issue deserves to better understood .      for an overview of the present approaches to the problem of the description of quantum spacetime , see for instance : c rovelli , _ strings , loops and the others : a critical survey on the present approaches to quantum gravity _ in _ gravitation and relativity : at the turn of the millennium _ , n dadhich j narlikar eds , pg 281 - 331 ( inter - university centre for astronomy and astrophysics , pune 1998 ) ; gr - qc/9803024 .    for a general discussion , see : c rovelli , _ the century of the incomplete revolution : searching for general relativistic quantum field theory _ , j. math .",
