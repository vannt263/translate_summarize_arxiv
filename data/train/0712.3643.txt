    "in this work we wish to understand the black hole information issue @xcite ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an overview ) by probing into one key aspect of it , namely , how information is distributed between the black hole and the quantum field throughout its history .",
    "we are not in a position to unequivocally decide on the end state of a black hole after emitting hawking radiation @xcite  remnants , naked singularity , baby universe formation or complete evaporation .",
    "( see e.g. , @xcite . ) nor are we equipped to enter into the debate in whether there is net information lost in a black hole and , the grander issue of whether unitarity in the laws of physics is violated .    on the specific aspect we are interested in , i.e. ,",
    "where information is registered , stored and transferred , a prevailing thought of the school which upholds the validity of unitarity ( and thus advocates no information loss ) is that information resides in the correlation between the black hole and its hawking radiation which persists down to the very end of evaporation .",
    "here we want to examine with the help of an analog model another contrasting view expressed earlier by one of us @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , assuming no violation of unitarity , namely , that information in the black hole is not lost but transferred and dispersed into the quantum field through hawking radiation , nor does it reside predominantly in the correlations between the black hole and the quantum field .",
    "@xcite proposes to use the correlation functions of an interacting field as registers of information and the dynamics of correlations as a measure of information flow accompanied by a suggested scenario where information in the black hole is transferred to the quantum field .",
    "according to the viewpoint put forth there , the appearance of information loss is primarily owing to the fact that actual physical measurements by a local observer are limited in accuracy , i.e. , one can only access the lowest order correlation functions , beginning with the mean field and the two - point functions .",
    "it also highlights the huge capacity of a quantum field in storing and dispensing information .",
    "we have recently studied an exactly solvable model where an uniformly accelerated detector is linearly coupled to a massless scalar field initially in the minkowski vacuum . based on the results of this study we drew some suggestive implications on the black hole information flow issue by invoking bekenstein s black hole atom analog .",
    "we give a brief description of the black hole atom analog below , followed by the detector - field model we studied .",
    "bekenstein observed that the black hole behaves like an ensemble of quantum mechanical atoms @xcite , whose spontaneous emissions correspond to hawking radiation , and the energy level of the atom is analogous to the area level of a black hole .",
    "when black holes are fed with field quanta , they tend to absorb more than emit energy .",
    "indeed , bekenstein and meisels showed that for black holes the einstein b coefficient for stimulated absorption is greater than the coefficient for stimulated emission @xcite .",
    "following this idea the atom ( or the particle detector considered below ) itself can be treated as an analog of the black hole .",
    "we can learn some physics about the black hole information issue from the ordinary quantum atom - field interacting system .",
    "( note that the theory for black hole atoms does not a priori assume any violation of unitarity and hence no information loss . )    quantum decoherence and recoherence of an inertial detector interacting with a quantum field in the ultraweak coupling regime has been studied before by anglin _",
    "@xcite they claimed that , as soon as the coupling is switched on , the oscillator loses the quantum coherence on a very short decoherence time corresponding to the cut - off time scale .",
    "but almost all the quantum coherence will recover in the end , after a much longer relaxation time .",
    "they then used these findings to draw some implications on the black hole information problem .",
    "please refer to our recent paper @xcite for a comparison of our findings in this more general case with theirs .",
    "let us consider a moving harmonic oscillator with internal degree of freedom @xmath1 ( known as the unruh - dewitt(ud ) detector @xcite ) interacting with a massless quantum scalar field @xmath2 in four - dimensional minkowski space .",
    "the action of the combined particle detector - quantum field system is given by @xcite @xmath3 -\\int d^4 x { 1\\over 2}\\partial_\\mu\\phi      \\partial^\\mu\\phi",
    "+ { \\lambda_0}\\int d\\tau\\int d^4 x q(\\tau)\\phi ( x )    \\delta^4\\left(x^{\\mu}-z^{\\mu}(\\tau)\\right ) , \\label{stot1}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the coupling constant , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the bare mass and natural frequency of the detector , respectively .",
    "we will consider the cases when it is uniformly accelerated along the trajectory @xmath7 with proper acceleration @xmath8 .",
    "for the cases of detectors at rest ( @xmath9 ) , we have learnt in @xcite that the two - point functions of our ud detector theory in ( 3 + 1)d with finite @xmath8 have no singular behavior as @xmath10 .",
    "hence all our results expressed in terms of these two - point functions apply equally well to the case of detectors at rest .",
    "we study the case when the initial state of the combined system is a direct product of a quantum state @xmath11 for the detector @xmath1 and the minkowski vacuum @xmath12 for the field @xmath2 , @xmath13 since the combined system is linear , the operators evolve in the heisenberg picture as linear transformations . when sandwiched by the factorized initial state @xmath14 ,",
    "the two - point functions of the detector and those of the field split into two parts @xcite , e.g. , @xmath15 here @xmath16 depends on the initial state of the detector only , while @xmath17 depends on the initial state of the field , namely the minkowski vacuum .",
    "therefore by studying the correlation functions @xmath18 of the detector and those of the field , one can monitor how the information initially in the detector is flowing into the field .    indeed , from ref .",
    "@xcite , we learned that @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 all decay after the coupling is switched on , and the information about the initial state of the detector is subsumed into the quantum field ( in @xmath22 , etc . )",
    "this view is further supported by the energy conservation law found in @xcite between the internal energy of the detector and the radiated energy of a monopole .",
    "the energy in @xmath23 and @xmath20 will be converted to monopole radiation while the state of the detector at late times is sustained only by the vacuum fluctuations of the field .",
    "for a bipartite system with the combined system in a pure state , such as the unruh - dewitt detector theory with initial state @xmath14 , the purity of each sub - system @xmath24 ^ 2 =   { \\cal p}_\\phi \\equiv tr_\\phi\\left(\\rho^r [ \\phi,\\phi']\\right)^2\\ ] ] is equal to the other and gives a measures of the entanglement between them . on the other hand ,",
    "the purity of a two - level atom is proportional to its polarization , thus providing a measure of quantum coherence in that atom .",
    "here we extend this view to our system and use the value of the purity function as a measure of quantum coherence in the detector and in the field as well .",
    "the behavior of quantum coherence  flow \" is quite different from energy flow . when the coupling is switched on , both the quantum coherence in the detector and the quantum coherence in the field decrease , while the entanglement between them increases .",
    "so quantum coherence does not flow from one subsystem to the other ; it goes into sustaining the entanglement between the two subsystems .",
    "a lower purity means lesser quantum coherence in the detector or the field and stronger entanglement between the detector and the field . to show this one may define the linear entropy in terms of the purity as @xmath25 now the value of @xmath26 is zero for a detector in a pure state and is positive for a detector in a mixed state . by definition",
    "the linear entropy seen by the detector will be equal to the linear entropy seen by the field .",
    "also , the greater the von neumann entropy of the detector , the greater @xmath26 . thus @xmath26 could serve as a measure of entanglement between the detector and the field , just as good as the von neumann entropy , for the bipartite system in a pure state .    as an example , suppose the detector is in a cat state at the initial moment @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the ground state and the first excited state of the free detector , @xmath31 is the mixing angle and @xmath32 is a constant phase .",
    "the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) of the detector for this initial state reads @xmath33",
    "\\right\\ } , \\label{rdmd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 , @xmath35 . the coefficients @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 could be expressed in terms of the two - point correlation functions of the detector .",
    "explicit expressions of the two - point functions needed here have been listed in appendix a of ref .",
    "actually all @xmath37 and @xmath38 will vanish at late times ( @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) when the rdm of all choices of @xmath32 and @xmath31 for initial states become a universal one , @xmath44 hence the purity ( or the linear entropy ) goes to a universal value at late times .",
    "of @xmath45 in detector s proper time . here",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51(left ) and @xmath52(right ) .",
    "the three curves from top to bottom in each plot ( the bottom one in the left plot is very close to the @xmath53 axis , while the three curves are indistinguishable in the right plot ) have @xmath54 , respectively . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]   of @xmath45 in detector s proper time . here",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51(left ) and @xmath52(right ) .",
    "the three curves from top to bottom in each plot ( the bottom one in the left plot is very close to the @xmath53 axis , while the three curves are indistinguishable in the right plot ) have @xmath54 , respectively . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]      the linear entropies of the rdm @xmath55 with different parameters are illustrated in figure [ sl2 ] . in the ultraweak coupling regime ( @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a large constant corresponding to the time - resolution or the frequency cut - off of this theory , @xmath58 with @xmath59 the renormalized natural frequency of the detector ) @xcite , for @xmath60 sufficiently small , one has @xmath61 one can see that in this regime @xmath62 is very close to unity at late times , when each subsystem re - gains almost all quantum coherence and turns into a nearly pure state .",
    "indeed , observing the left plot of figure [ sl2 ] , the linear entropy @xmath26 in the detector increases from zero right after the coupling is switched on , reaches a maximum @xmath63 at @xmath64 , then decays to a small common value that detectors with all other initial states will asymptopte to .",
    "this decay of the degree of entanglement or the restoration of the degree of quantum coherence is known as  recoherence \" @xcite .",
    "the late - time recoherence manifests only in the ultraweak coupling regime with sufficiently low acceleration ( temperature ) , where the late - time rdm of the detector looks very close to the density matrix of the ground state of a free detector .",
    "thus the recoherence here characterizes the process of spontaneous emission by which the detector initially in an excited state will finally fall into a steady state which is very close to the ground state of the free detector . nevertheless , _",
    "full _ recoherence is impossible once the coupling is on , since the late - time linear entropy @xmath65\\right ] + o(\\gamma^2)\\ ] ] ( @xmath66 ) remains nonzero for any positive @xmath67 , even when @xmath10 .",
    "if the detector is initially in its first excited state ( @xmath68 ) , the two - point function @xmath69 at @xmath70 will have the same value as the average of those @xmath71 from the ground state and from the first excited state at the initial moment .",
    "it may seem that the intermediate state of the detector during the transition is a cat state which is a superposition of the ground state and the first excited state of the detector , but this is not true .",
    "large @xmath26 in transient indicates that the intermediate state during the spontaneous emission is a mixed state , in contrast to the zero @xmath26 for a pure cat state ( at the initial moment of the middle curve in the left plot of figure [ sl2 ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath72 in transient is mainly an ensemble ( probabilistic ) average of the population in the ground state and the population in the first excited state .      when @xmath73 , the system is in the non - markovian regime and the purity is always small ( right plot in figure [ sl2 ] ) , which implies that the detector experiences strong decoherence associated with strong entanglement between the detector and the field .",
    "the behavior of the detector is dominated by the physical cut - offs and the differences between various initial states of the detector can be negligible .",
    "for example , when @xmath68 , just like the case with the detector initially in its ground state , the initial distribution of the rdm in the energy - eigenstate representation @xmath74 peaked at the element @xmath75 would , upon the switch - on of the coupling , collapse rapidly into a distribution widely spread over the whole density matrix , for which the energy eigenstates of the free detector can not form a good basis because the off - diagonal terms of the rdm do not vanish even in a steady state @xcite .",
    "the late - time linear entropy @xmath76 } } + o(\\lambda_1^{-3/2})\\ ] ] is very close to unity .",
    "hence there is no late - time recoherence in this regime , where the quantum state of the combined system is far from being a direct product of the state of the detector and that of the field .     in ultrahigh acceleration limit :",
    "@xmath77 , @xmath78 , other parameters have the same values as those in figure 1 .",
    "as indicated in the right plot , the curves with different @xmath31 are not distinguishable in the left plot.,title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]   in ultrahigh acceleration limit : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , other parameters have the same values as those in figure 1 .",
    "as indicated in the right plot , the curves with different @xmath31 are not distinguishable in the left plot.,title=\"fig:\",width=275 ]    a large linear entropy at late times also shows up at the ultrahigh acceleration ( or unruh temperature ) limit ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 ( see figure [ higha ] ) . when the coupling is weak enough",
    ", the energy eigenstates can still form a good basis and the rdm of the detector is approximately a thermal state in the energy - eigenstate representation : all off - diagonal elements are negligible .",
    "note that the ultrahigh temperature limit is still in a markovian regime , so we see that strong entanglement does not imply a non - markovian process .",
    "from our results we can see that , as long as the coupling between the detector and the field is on , the detector and the field are separately in a mixed state of its own , while the combined system remains in a pure state .",
    "the mixed state of the detector carries information of the initial state until @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 all decay away and the detector reaches a steady state . at late times , while the energy eigenstates of the free detector can not form a good basis , the rdm of the detector can be diagonalized to a boltzmann distribution from which one can read off the same effective temperature as those reported in @xcite . in this sense",
    "the final mixed state of the detector is a thermal state containing no initial information .",
    "this is true for both inertial and uniformly accelerating detectors , the former case might be a surprise .",
    "similarly , when the black hole is radiating , the black hole itself and the field outside the black hole are each in a mixed state . only in the ultraweak coupling limit",
    "can they restore most of their purity at late times .",
    "otherwise , in the more prevalent non - markovian regime , the area eigenstates of the black hole can not form a good basis , and the entanglement between the black hole and the field is always large .",
    "nevertheless , in this scenerio the quantum state of the combined system is always pure due to the unitarity we assumed .",
    "the existence of einstein a and b coefficient for black holes @xcite suggests that , if the field is initially in a vacuum state , the information about the black hole would be encoded in its spontaneous emission , namely , its emitted radiation which is not exactly thermal .",
    "all initial information in the black hole will eventually go to the field at late times , while the final state of the black hole is sustained by the vacuum fluctuations of the quantum field .",
    "this is consistent with the  no - hiding theorem \" of braunstein and pati ( with their ancilla as our quantum field ) @xcite : no information is hidden in the correlations between the field and the black hole .    in our model the difference between the degrees of freedom of the detector and those of the field",
    "is put in by hand and never disappears , so we can not address whether the ground state corresponds to a black hole remnant , an ordinary localized mass , or nothing . however , in bekenstein s atom analog highly excited eigenstates correspond to large - area black holes .",
    "our results indicate that in the rather general non - markovian regime , the combined system would evolve to a highly entangled state between the black hole and the field , and the final state of the black hole would be a mixed state distributed widely from the ground state to the highly excited area - eigenstates .",
    "so at late times in the broad ranged non - markovian regime the black hole could end up as a large remnant with all its initial information already leaked out and dispersed into the quantum field . + * acknowledgement * blh thanks the organizers of this workshop , especially stefano liberati , for their invitation and hospitality .",
