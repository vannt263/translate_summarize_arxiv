    "the democratic neutrino theory ( dnt ) , which was introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , is based on a simple @xmath1 symmetric leading order democratic mass matrix , which allows to make certain predictions on the neutrino masses and mixing . in particular , a generic neutrino mass spectrum in dnt with small perturbations can be approximately written as ( small deviation of @xmath2 from @xmath3 is irrelevant ) @xmath4 where @xmath5  ev is the absolute neutrino mass scale , which is determined from the atmospheric neutrino oscillation data , and @xmath6 is a perturbation in the democratic neutrino mass spectrum . in this model",
    "the mixing angles can be approximately determined as @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( in the standard parametrization ) .",
    "these predictions agree with the present solar , atmospheric and accelerator neutrino data .",
    "however the alternative explanations with respect to the conventional neutrino theory ( cnt )  @xcite of many neutrino results are required  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the suppression of the atmospheric @xmath10 oscillations , which was observed by the super - kamiokande  @xcite , is explained in cnt by small @xmath11 .",
    "it was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite that in dnt this suppression may take place due to the earth s matter effect . in this paper",
    "we investigate this possibility in more detail .",
    "another essential difference between dnt and cnt is in explanation of the large amplitude of the atmospheric @xmath12 oscillations , which was observed by the super - kamiokande and minos  @xcite . in cnt",
    "this close to unity amplitude is explained by the large @xmath13 oscillations due to the large values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where each of them is about @xmath16 .",
    "however in dnt this result is explained by the sum of @xmath13 and @xmath17 oscillations , where they both are significant .",
    "finally , in dnt the fluxes of incoherent massive neutrino eigenstates at the earth correspond to the mass composition of the electron neutrino at production in the core of the sun .",
    "however cnt assumes either that these fluxes correspond to the mass composition of neutrino at the last scattering surface or neutrino coherence at the earth .",
    "first possibility does not work since the interactions of neutrinos with the matter of the sun do not change the lepton number .",
    "second possibility is not realistic due to the separation of the neutrino wave packets .",
    "hence the explanation of solar neutrinos in cnt is in question .    we should stress that due to these differences in explanation of the particular neutrino phenomena in dnt and cnt the results of conventional global analysis of the neutrino data can not be applied to dnt directly",
    "this paper is one of the steps in the direction to an adequate global analysis , which is required for accurate verification of dnt .",
    "we notice a strong hierarchy @xmath18 between the two neutrino mass splittings @xmath19 and @xmath20 in dnt with tiny perturbations , which significantly simplifies the investigation of the neutrino propagation through the earth . moreover the given value of the 1 - 3 mixing angle removes the major uncertainty in the neutrino oscillogram , which is investigated in the next section .",
    "the evolution of the neutrino state over a finite distance from @xmath21 to @xmath22 can be described using the evolution matrix @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath24 satisfies the same evolution equation as the state vector @xmath25 , namely , @xmath26 in this equation the hamiltonian can be written as and [ section : b ] a symmetric hamiltonian ( with @xmath27 ) for @xmath28 system is used , which differs from eq .   by a term proportional to the unit matrix ,",

    "the main differences of the shown dnt result from the cnt one for the mantle - only crossing trajectories are : ( 1 ) larger values of @xmath102 in the lower part of shown ( @xmath63 , @xmath30 ) area ; ( 2 ) existence of the two bands ( instead of one ) with large values of @xmath102 , which are separated by the band with small values of @xmath102 , in the energy range @xmath104  gev .    for the core - crossing trajectories the differences between dnt and cnt results are even more dramatic :",

    "also the values of @xmath102 are essentially smaller in dnt with respect to cnt for @xmath103gev .",

    ", we have found the neutrino oscillogram driven by the 1 - 3 mixing in the matter of the earth in the framework of the democratic neutrino theory .",
