    "many topological properties have been proposed and measured to characterize complex networks  @xcite . among them , centrality measures ( such as degree , betweenness @xcite or eigenvector @xcite centrality ) aim at quantifying the relative importance of individual vertices in the overall topology ; they are often related to the behavior of processes unfolding on the complex network structure , such as spreading or diffusion  @xcite .",
    "prominent in this context is the @xmath2-core decomposition , a recursive pruning procedure  @xcite which iteratively peels off nodes from the network ( @xmath2-shells ) , leaving subsets ( @xmath2-cores ) which are increasingly dense and mutually interconnected .",
    "the @xmath2-core decomposition proceeds as follows : starting with the full graph , nodes with degree @xmath3 are removed , repeating this operation iteratively until only nodes with degree @xmath4 remain .",
    "the removed nodes constitute the @xmath5-shell , and those that remain are the @xmath6-core .",
    "next , all nodes with degree @xmath7 are iteratively removed , yielding the @xmath6-shell and the @xmath8-core ( remaining network ) .",
    "the process is repeated until one more iteration removes all nodes .",
    "the coreness @xmath9 of a node is the index of the @xmath2-shell to which node @xmath10 belongs , and it has been argued that the set of nodes with maximum coreness plays an important role in epidemic spreading @xcite .",
    "recently , a new set of centrality measures has been proposed @xcite , based on the concept of the hirsch @xmath11-index introduced to quantify research impact of scientists @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11-index @xmath12 of node @xmath10 in a network is defined in analogy to the hirsch index for citations : it is the maximum number @xmath13 , such that there are at least @xmath13 neighbors of this node with degree larger than or equal to @xmath13 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this concept is generalized to a hierarchy of @xmath1-th order hirsch indices , @xmath0 , using the following construction : define an operator @xmath14 that is equal to the maximum integer @xmath15 such that there are at least @xmath15 elements in @xmath16 with a value larger than or equal to @xmath15 .",
    "defining @xmath17 , the degree of node @xmath10 , the @xmath11-index , @xmath18 , is defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the set of nearest neighbors of node @xmath10 .",

    "a @xmath0-shell is the set of nodes with @xmath1-th order hirsch indexequal to some value @xmath13 ; a @xmath0-core is defined as the set of all nodes with @xmath1-th order hirsch indexlarger than or equal to a given value @xmath13 .",

    "@xcite , where it is argued that , in some instances , the @xmath0 index of a node can be a better predictor of the influence of a node @xcite in epidemic spreading than the degree or the coreness .",
    "here we study the relation between the different @xmath0 indices and the degree @xmath24 of the corresponding node within the annealed network approximation @xcite . in the case of uncorrelated networks , we observe that the @xmath1-th order @xmath11-index and the degree of a node are strongly linked .",
    "this sort of correlation extends also , in some cases , to real networks , rife with degree correlations @xcite .",
    "moreover , we test the validity of the hirsch indexas a predictor of spreading influence . we find its performance to be sometimes slightly better than degree or @xmath2-core centralities but generally largely worse than the recently introduced non - backtracking ( nbt ) centrality  @xcite .",

    "a theoretical analysis performed on uncorrelated networks within the annealed network approximation reveals that the value of the hirsch indexof order @xmath1 is strongly related with degree , in the sense that nodes within a given @xmath145-shell have a well defined average degree with small fluctuations around it .",
