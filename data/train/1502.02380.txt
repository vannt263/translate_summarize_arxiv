    "the second fermi lat source catalog @xcite includes as many as 1,873 sources , but initial attempts to identify counterparts at other wavelengths resulted in 575 sources remaining unidentified .",
    "the 2fgl catalog is based on the first 24 months of lat observation since its launch in 2008 , but the lat has now accumulated more than 5 years of high - energy gamma - ray data almost flawlessly , presenting the possibility of finding new sources which were too faint to be detected in the first two years of data or showed flaring activity after the catalog was created .    in this paper",
    "we report on two new gamma - ray sources serendipitously discovered in the constellation leo and discuss possible conterparts based on radio observations including recent snap - shots with the australia telescope compact array .",
    "our original aim was to search for gamma - ray emission from ngc 3628 ( arp 317 ) , one of the three galaxies called the leo triplet , for which possible starburst activity has been reported based on xmm observations @xcite .",
    "five years of archival data of fermi lat has been analyzed using the fermi science tools supplied by fermi science support center ( @xcite , fermi science tools v9r23p1 ) .",
    "the energy range used in the present analysis was from 100 mev to 300 gev .",
    "source class events detected at zenith angles smaller than @xmath4 were used for analysis , assuming p7source_v6 instrument response function along with the standard analysis pipeline suggested by fssc .",
    "the significance of gamma - ray signal has been estimated by maximum likelihood method with a help of the gtlike program ( which we used in the binned mode ) included in the tools .",
    "the data periods for this studies span from 2008 august 4 to 2012 october 27 .    for ngc 3628 ( arp 317 ) , the test statistic , @xmath5 , returned by gtlike is consistent with zero , indicating there is no evidence of gamma - ray emission .",
    "thus we calculated upper limits to gamma - ray flux from ngc 3628 of @xmath6  @xmath7s@xmath8 , at 95% c.l .",
    ", above 100mev for the period 2008 august 4 to 2010 july 31 ( 2010 july 31 to 2012 october 27 ) .",
    "this is translated to gamma - ray luminosity upper limit of @xmath9  erg  s@xmath8 assuming the distance of 12mpc which is derived as the median of 8 measurements , which range from 6.7 to 14.2mpc @xcite .    during the study of ngc 3628 , we noticed two rather bright gamma - ray sources in the field of view centered on ngc 3628 and within a radius of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "they are not coincident with any source listed in the 2fgl catalogue @xcite nor in the 3eg catalogue @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : cmap ] shows a gamma - ray countmap of this area .",
    "the positions for these sources were estimated using the gttsmap program which calculates the @xmath5 value assuming an unknown source at various positions in the field - of - view of interest , and the maximum @xmath5 values were obtained for positions shown in the table [ tab : pos ] .",
    "the errors of the positions are conservatively estimated as the radius at which the @xmath5 value drops to the half value .     grid and smoothed for the data during 2008 august 05 to 2013 july 03 .",
    "2fgl sources are annotated , and two new gamma - ray sources are marked as unknown_1 ( j1103.2 + 1145 ) and unknown_2 ( j1049.7 + 0435).,width=302 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we have also examined the asdc sky explorer ( asdc @xcite ) and nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned @xcite ) for other possible counterparts , but we did not find any good candidates nearer than radio sources mentioned above .    in the light of the above facts , we tentatively identify both gamma - ray sources with the radio sources mentioned above .",
    "petrov et al .",
    "@xcite make a detailed consideration of the utility of radio observations in finding counterparts to unidentified fermi sources .",
    "the associations proposed here would be strengthened by improved gamma - ray localisations , and/or evidence of contemporaneous multi - wavelength flaring , and , in the case of gb6 j1050 + 0432 , with vlbi observations to determine whether the source contains a compact , parsec - scale , radio core .",
    "a search for gamma - rays from ngc 3628 ( arp 317 ) , for which possible starburst activity has been reported , found no evidence for @xmath11100mev emission .",
    "however , two new gev sources , fermi j1049.7 + 0435 and j1103.2 + 1145 , have been found near the leo triplet region using fermi - lat archival data spanning 5 years . the fluxes for both sources increase over the 5 yr period : thus they are not included in 2fgl catalog .",
    "their flux variability and spectral indices are compatible with those of gamma - ray detected agn .",
    "based on angular separation , radio flux density and spectral index , we associate j1049.7 + 0435 with gb6 j1050 + 0432 , and j1103.2 + 1145 with the quasar gb6 j1103 + 1158 .",
    "further multiwavelength studies are required to confirm these identifications .",
    "this work is supported in part by the grant - in - aid from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) of japan , no .",
    "the australia telescope compact array is part of the australia telescope national facility which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
    "leonid petrov is acknowledged for his independent suggestion of gb6 j1103 + 1158 as the possible counterpart to j1103.2 + 1145 .",
