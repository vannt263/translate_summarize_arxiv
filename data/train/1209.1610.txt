    "neutral pion production in @xmath0=130 and 200 gev central au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider has been found to be strongly suppressed in comparison to the expectations from properly scaled p+p collisions  @xcite , while data from d+au collisions showed no suppression or enhancement  @xcite , indicating that hadron suppression is a final state effect .",
    "this observation was one of the first convincing signatures of a strongly interacting partonic medium created in high energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "the nuclear modification factor @xmath2quantifies the departure from the above scaling .",
    "it is generally defined as a function of transverse momentum and pseudorapidity , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the production cross section of @xmath6 in p+p collisions , @xmath7 is the nuclear overlap function averaged over the relevant range of impact parameters , and @xmath8is the number of binary collisions computed with @xmath9 .",

    "energies have shown that such effects indeed play an important role : while @xmath0=200 and 62.4 gev central data in this smaller system still show a suppression , pion production in 22.4 gev cu+cu collisions is moderately enhanced at @xmath11 , virtually independently of centrality  @xcite .",
    "production of @xmath6s has been measured in @xmath0=62.4 gev and 39 gev au+au collisions in 2010 , as part of the rhic low energy program  @xcite .",
    "these data , which reach up to @xmath12 , allow for the study of the onset and evolution of the suppression , and restricts theoretical models .",
    "for a better understanding on the interplay of the different effects of nuclear modification , other observables , such as the fractional momentum shift @xmath13 , are also measured .",
    "azimuthal asymmetries with respect to the reaction plain carry additional information on the collision geometry .",
    "recent phenix measurements at @xmath14 of @xmath6azimuth - dependent nuclear modification factor @xmath15 up to @xmath16  @xcite give additional constraints on energy loss mechanisms .",
