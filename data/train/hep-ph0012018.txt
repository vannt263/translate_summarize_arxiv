    "a warning : in endpoint type experiments , the sums on @xmath14 extend _ just _ on neutrino masses within the region of measurement ( typically much narrower than the @xmath15 range , @xmath16 ) .",
    "is is likely to measure something more than @xmath17 the answer is conditional ; _ no _ , if the energy resolution @xmath18 is larger than the level spacing ; for this would mean averaging the @xmath0-spectrum @xmath19 reducing it to @xmath20 ( far from endpoint the effective spectrum reproduces well the true one , as seen in fig .",

    "_ maybe yes _ ,",
    "if one level ( at least ) stands out from the other ones .",
    "so the answer depends essentially on the detector characteristics . to be specific ,",
    "if we assume that @xmath21 has mass in the @xmath22 ev region , @xmath23 could be not adequate to describe existing tritium endpoint data @xcite ( unless the mixing of @xmath21 with @xmath3 is so little , that its effect is invisible ) .",
    "we assume that this does not happen ; thus , a describes the modifications of the nuclear @xmath0-spectrum .",
    "however , we stress again that a single parameter suffices _ if _ the spectrum is `` not resolved '' .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 can be compared with @xmath24 ( the ee - entry of the majorana neutrino mass matrix , squared ) that leads to @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "note that:@xmath25 the presence of the majorana phases @xmath26 that can produce cancellations in @xmath27@xmath25 the different dependence on @xmath28 individual contributions scale as @xmath29 while @xmath30 thence , the @xmath31 parameter is more severely suppressed than the @xmath32 by @xmath33     in arbitrary unities .",

    "we will consider certain scenarios of oscillations and .",
    "motivated by existing indications of oscillation @xcite , we select 6 cases with 4-@xmath1 ( @xmath45 ! level permutations ) and 6 cases with 3-@xmath1 ( implies to discard one of the indications ) .",
    "the caption of tab .  1 and two",
    "examples should suffice to clarify our terminology : 1 ) the spectrum sal is the 4-@xmath1 spectrum , where the splitting @xmath46 is related to solar neutrinos , @xmath47 to atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath48 to lsnd .",
    "2 ) the spectrum sa does not account for lsnd , and entails 3-@xmath1 .",
    "we assume that a `` sterile '' neutrino plays a role , but only in the 4-@xmath1 cases .",
    "there are 3 main cases : this happens for the 4-@xmath1 spectra als , lsa , las @xcite , and for the 3-@xmath1 spectra al and ls , where @xmath49 mev .",
    "indeed , the @xmath3 state has to stand above the `` lsnd mass gap '' , because it must be involved in the solar doublet of levels , or ( only for the al case in the other four cases , it is instead _",
    "possible _ to arrange such a cancellation for @xmath50 but the solar mixing has to be large . ] ) because we know that the atmospheric doublet is mostly @xmath51 this is the most appealing case for the future experiments that aim at finding an effect of massive neutrinos in @xmath0-decay spectra .",
    "however , all these 5 spectra might have troubles with sn1987a @xmath1 s @xcite : in fact , the mixing of @xmath52 that we need to explain lsnd produces resonant msw conversion s , lsnd and atmospheric included . ]",
    "@xcite of @xmath53 into @xmath54 this implies an average energy of the dominant class of events ( @xmath55 ) significantly larger than expected , that does not seem to be what data suggest .",
    "there are 5 sub - cases : ( 1 ) the first two spectra are sal and asl . for them , @xmath56 mev .",
    "in fact , the mixing that lead to appearance in lsnd is in these schemes @xcite @xmath57 the product of those mixings that would lead to disappearance in bugey @xcite , @xmath58 and in cdhs @xcite , @xmath59 ( the _ final _ lsnd data do not contradict this , but the bound is almost saturated ) .",
    "( 2 ) then we have the spectrum la .",
    "@xmath60 is tunable up to @xmath61 mev , since one can arrange the lighter state to be @xmath62 the mixing @xmath52 is fixed by lsnd , while @xmath63 ( that is what matters for us ) is only loosely constrained by bugey .",
    "( 3 ) next case is sl ; again , @xmath60 is tunable . if @xmath64 @xmath65 mev , if @xmath66 instead , @xmath67 mev .",
    "( 4 ) the _ naive _ expectation for the sla spectrum is @xmath68 but in fact @xmath60 can be larger , if : @xmath69 this case shows that @xmath70 can go up @xmath71 [ @xmath72 is a linear combination of @xmath73 and @xmath74 @xmath5 is a linear combination of @xmath75 and @xmath76 and the orthogonal states have obvious notations ] , still keeping the probability of appearance @xmath77 and the probability of disappearance @xmath78 ( 5 ) last case is the spectrum as , where the trivial identification @xmath79 mev holds .",
    "we remind the reader that this case is among the targets of next generation @xmath4 experiments , indeed @xmath80 sn1987a bounds can be avoided ( at the price of a fine tuning of the relevant mixing ) .",
    "this includes only the 3-@xmath1 spectrum sa , when @xmath81 ( lma has been assumed ) .",
    "if solar oscillations will be confirmed , but miniboone should not support lsnd findings , this case would be quite ( most ? ) likely .",

    "oscillations lead to consider neutrino mass ; this could be related with @xmath86 proton decay , _ etc . _ but perhaps , the _ most direct _ connections are those with the @xmath4 decay , and possible distortions of the @xmath0-decay spectra . in this view , we considered the parameter @xmath23 and discussed the expectations on that part of it , @xmath42 related with oscillations ( eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] ) .",
    "we have outlined a troublesome connections of those schemes that predict the largest values of @xmath70 with sn1987a neutrinos .",
    "still , @xmath70 could be relatively large ( perhaps observable in future setups ) if lsnd indications are due to @xmath87 appearance .",
    "this is strictly connected with @xmath87 _ disappearance _ , since the implied mixing @xmath63 is the parameter that matters for @xmath0-decay spectra .",
