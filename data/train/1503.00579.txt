    "the search for superconductivity and magnetic order in carbon - based materials triggered a large number of studies in recent years .",

    "in contrast to graphite and in spite of theoretical predictions on the possibility to have magnetic order due to hydrogen or vacancies in carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) @xcite , the observation of this phenomenon in these carbon structures appears to be more difficult . apparently , only the hydrogenated cnt prepared in @xcite showed the existence of magnetic order at room temperature .",

    "we found that an extra contribution to the magnetoresistance appears at @xmath4k and at low enough input currents .",
    "this fact and the observed positive magnetoresistance with its hysteretic behavior suggest the existence of superconductivity in a similar temperature range as the one found recently in dwcnt @xcite as well as in pyrolytic graphite flakes under an electric field @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetization , its hysteresis and other features support also the existence of magnetic order and to some extent of superconductivity .",

    "the h@xmath7 and c@xmath7h@xmath9 were turned off and the substrate was post - annealed in the remaining ar and ar / o@xmath7 for 2 minutes .",
    "then the ar / o@xmath7 gas was turned off , and h@xmath7 gas was turned on for an additional minute of anneal . then the h@xmath7 gas was turned off , and the sample was removed from the heated zone and positioned above a cooling fan ( with ar still flowing within the tube ) until it was cool enough to be removed for characterization .",

    "due to the apparent relationship of this transition to the development of a tunneling region , it is tempting to assume that the superconductivity appears at the junctions of the dwcnt .",

    "<S> the magnetotransport properties were studied in hundreds of micrometer length double - wall carbon nanotubes ( dwcnt ) bundles . above 15  k </S>",
    "<S> the resistance shows an ohmic behavior and its temperature dependence is well described using the variable - range hopping for one - dimensional system . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetoresistance is negative and can be explained using an empirical model based on spin - scattering processes indicating the existence of magnetic order up to room temperature . at temperatures between 2  k and 15  k </S>",
    "<S> the resistance is non - ohmic and the current - voltage characteristics reveal the appearance of a potential , which can be well described by a fluctuation - induced tunneling conduction model . in this low temperature range and at low enough input current </S>",
    "<S> , a positive magnetoresistance appears - in addition to the negative one - with an extraordinary hysteresis in field and vanishes at @xmath0k , suggesting the existence of a superconducting state . </S>",
