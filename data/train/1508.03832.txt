    "the problem of the maximum mass - radius ratio of a stable compact object is one of the most fundamental problems in both general relativity and theoretical astrophysics . in a classic paper ,",
    "buchdahl @xcite obtained the famous result that the ratio of the total mass @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 of a high density stable star can not exceed the value 4/9 , @xmath6 .",
    "the two basic physical assumptions used in the derivation of the upper bound for the mass - radius ratio are that the energy density in the star does not increase outwards and that the pressure is isotropic . on the other hand , by applying the principle of causality and le chtelier s principle , in @xcite it was shown through numerical integration of the general relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation ) that the maximum mass of the equilibrium configuration of a dense star can not exceed @xmath7 , where @xmath8 g is the solar mass .",
    "this numerical value is presently adopted in the astrophysical literature as indicating the mass limit separating black holes from stable stellar type configurations .    due to its major astrophysical and theoretical importance",
    ", the buchdahl limit has been extensively investigated .",
    "the effects of the presence of a cosmological constant on the stellar mass - radius ratio were considered in @xcite , while limits on @xmath9 for charged spheres were derived in @xcite . in @xcite , it was argued that some of the assumptions used to derive the buchdahl inequality were very restrictive .",
    "for example , neither of them hold for a simple soap bubble . by relaxing these assumptions and considering any static solution of the spherically symmetric einstein equations for which the energy density @xmath10 and the radial and tangential pressures , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , satisfy the condition @xmath13 , @xmath14",
    ", one can obtain the relation @xmath15\\leq",
    "\\left[\\left(1 + 2\\omega\\right)^2 - 1\\right]/\\left(1 + 2\\omega \\right)^2 $ ] @xcite .",
    "these bounds were generalized to the case of charged compact general relativistic objects in @xcite .",
    "bounds on @xmath9 for static objects with a positive cosmological constant @xmath16 were obtained in @xcite , where it was shown that the relation @xmath17 holds if the energy conditions listed above are satisfied .",
    "buchdahl type inequalities , expressed in terms of the mean fluid density of the sphere , in space - times with arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath0 were also derived in @xcite , while the case of stable stars in five dimensional gauss - bonnet gravity was considered in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in @xmath1 dimensions the buchdahl inequality for the maximum mass - radius ratio can be formulated as @xmath18 .",
    "the standard assumptions used in deriving the buchdahl inequality were relaxed in @xcite , where various matter property depending bounds were obtained .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that , in the framework of classical general relativity , the presence of a positive cosmological constant implies the existence of a minimum mass and a minimum density in nature .",
    "these results follow rigorously from the generalized buchdahl inequalities for @xmath19 , with @xmath20 . in this scenario , the mass and mean density of a stable compact object must satisfy the conditions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "these bounds were extended to the case of anisotropic compact objects in @xcite , while bounds for the minimum masses of charged particles were derived in @xcite .",
    "the physical implications of the existence of a minimum mass ( in @xmath19 ) were investigated in @xcite .",
    "an especially important result is that the ratio @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the reduced planck length and @xmath25 is the four - dimensional cosmological constant , is numerically of the same order of magnitude as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 cm denotes the classical electron radius .",
    "this suggests the identification of @xmath25 in terms of fundamental physical constants as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the electron mass and charge , respectively @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the same formula was obtained using a set of axioms for @xmath25 based on a close analogy with the khinchin axioms in information theory @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the dependency of the information measure on probabilities of events was formally replaced by the dependency of the cosmological constant on the fundamental constants of nature @xcite .    in section [ quant ]",
    ", we also consider a new interpretation of the bound on @xmath23 , in terms of the chandrasekhar mass for a condensate of quantum dark energy particles .",
    "an intriguing possibility is that dark energy , obeying an equation of state of the form @xmath31 , may condense to form stable self - gravitating objects .",
    "this scenario was originally considered in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "dark energy stars or , in a wider sense , objects with negative pressure in their interiors , are interesting alternatives to the standard black hole paradigm . in one implementation of this idea , hypothetical compact general relativistic objects called gravastars ( _ gra_vitational _ va_cuum stars ) have been proposed as an alternative explanation for the astrophysical characteristics usually associated with black holes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the basic physical idea of this scenario is that the quantum vacuum undergoes a phase transition at the moment the event horizon is formed .",
    "therefore , the structure of a gravastar consists of an interior de sitter condensate obeying the dark energy equation of state , @xmath32 .",
    "this interior is matched to an exterior consisting of a shell of finite thickness described by the equation of state @xmath33 , and the shell is then matched at its vacuum boundary to an exterior schwarzschild solution .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the buchdahl limit , and the resulting minimum mass and density , for static spherically symmetric compact objects in an arbitrary @xmath1-dimensional geometry . from the einstein field equations in arbitrary dimensions with @xmath0 and the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ,",
    "the generalizations of the buchdahl limit for arbitrary @xmath1 , and of the minimum mass allowed for any classical elementary particle , are obtained . in the particular case of @xmath19",
    ", these limits reduce to the corresponding expressions given in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , cosmological observations such as those of high redshift supernovae or the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data from the planck mission @xcite suggest that the dark anergy equation of state is linear , with the state parameter lying in the range @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the thermodynamic pressure and the dark energy density , respectively @xcite .",
    "therefore , the possibility that dark energy is not _",
    "exactly _ a cosmological constant can not be rejected a priori .",
    "taking into account this possibility , we obtain the buchdahl and minimum mass limits in arbitrary space - time dimensions for dark energy obeying a linear barotropic equation of state .",
    "the conditions for the collapse of a star embedded in the dark energy fluid are also derived in both the de sitter and anti - de sitter cases .",
    "in addition , an interesting physical possibility is that dark energy may undergo a phase transition leading to a condensation process , which could be either gravitational or of bose - einstein type . in this scenario ,",
    "the condensation of dark energy ` particles ' could produce compact super - massive objects .",
    "we study the condensation process using the classical method of jeans instability @xcite , generalized to arbitrary space - time dimensions , and by taking into account the possibility of the presence of viscous dissipative effects in the dark energy fluid .",
    "the role of the dissipative processes in the occurrence of the jeans instability was studied in @xcite . as a first step we derive the mass of the dark energy condensate in the framework of the newtonian dissipationless approximation by assuming that the dark energy fluid condenses , or transforms via a phase transition , into an ideal non - relativistic fluid . in four dimensions ,",
    "the corresponding jeans mass is proportional to @xmath37 and its numerical value is close to the observationally estimated total mass of the universe .",
    "we also show that the jeans mass can be represented in a form similar to the chandrasekhar mass , that depends only on the fundamental constants .",
    "the effect of the bulk viscosity of the dark energy fluid on the condensation process is also investigated .",
    "although a self - consistent and credible theory of quantum gravity has not been found , we use general arguments to investigate the possible quantum mechanical implications of the existence of a minimum mass and minimum density .",
    "firstly , we show that , in four - dimensions , the jeans mass of the dark energy @xmath38 , having a numerical value of the order of the mass of the universe , can be obtained from thermodynamic considerations related to the physics of schwarzschild - de sitter black holes .",
    "we then associate the minimum mass with a temperature which , intriguingly , is very close to the present day temperature of the cmb radiation .",
    "moreover , we show that the existence of a minimum mass bound leads naturally to a hierarchical model in which quantum ` particles ' above a certain size effectively decohere via interaction with the cosmological constant ( or dark energy fluid ) and in which dark energy itself is composed of quantum particles with an effective mass proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ masss ] , the @xmath1-dimensional einstein field equations with a nonzero cosmological constant",
    "are introduced and the expressions for the buchdahl limit and the classical minimum mass are obtained .",
    "the more general case of a @xmath1-dimensional sphere of matter embedded in a dark energy fluid obeying an arbitrary barotropic equation of state is considered in section  [ massdes ] , and the corresponding limiting masses are derived .",
    "the jeans instability of the dark energy fluid is discussed in section  [ jeans ] , within the framework of a simple newtonian model .",
    "finally , the quantum mechanical implications of the existence of a classical minimal mass and density are investigated in section  [ quant ] and a brief discussion of our main results is presented in section  [ concl ] .",
    "in this section , we first introduce the einstein field equations in arbitrary space - time dimensions with @xmath0 and derive the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation ) for spherically symmetric objects . we then derive the @xmath1-dimensional generalizations of the buchdahl limit and of the minimum mass in general relativity . in estimating critical length and mass scales throughout this paper we use the approximate values",

    "thus , it turns out that , with the exception of some composition - dependent numerical factors of order unity , the maximum mass of a compact star can be expressed in terms of fundamental physical constants only .    using eq .",

    "the effective mass of the elementary dark matter particles is of order of @xmath218 g.      in order to investigate the effects of the dissipative processes on the jeans condensation of the dark energy fluid , we consider a simple case in which we neglect the shear viscosity by taking @xmath219 . the only viscous dissipative effect",
    "is then given by the bulk viscosity and the equation describing the density perturbations of the dark energy fluid takes the form [ visc ] & = & v_s^2 ^ 2_de^(1)+_de^(1)+_0 ^ 2 _ de^(1 ) . +    by looking again for plane wave solutions of eq .",

    "thus , from eq .",
    "( [ omegaf ] ) , it follows that we obtain a time dependent exponential regime for @xmath220 , and a damped oscillatory regime for @xmath221 .",
    "it is important to note that the pure oscillatory jeans condensation regime of the @xmath1-dimensional ideal dark energy fluid is lost . on the other hand ,",
    "the viscous effects do not change the threshold value of the jeans mass of the dark energy fluid , though they may drastically modify the evolution of the perturbations .",
    "the equation @xmath222 has two solutions for @xmath223 , given by k _ d^=^1/2 .",

    "0v_s^2 , on the bulk viscosity coefficient of the dark energy fluid .",
    "in this section , we consider the quantum mechanical implications of a classical minimum mass density , implied by the generalized buchdahl inequalities in the presence of a positive cosmological constant , @xmath224 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the @xmath19 case , in which the generalized buchdahl inequality implies @xcite @xmath225 where @xmath226 denotes the minimum density .    we now define the ( non - reduced ) planck length and mass scales as @xmath227 and the ( non - reduced ) wesson masses @xcite as @xmath228 where we have parameterized @xmath25 in terms of a characteristic length scale via @xmath229 in his original definitions @xcite , wesson used @xmath230 instead of @xmath231 but , for convenience , we adopt the definitions in eq .",
    "( [ wesson ] ) and use the non - reduced planck scales , since these are analogous to the standard definition of the compton wavelength using @xmath231 , not @xmath230 .",
    "hence , @xmath232 is just the compton wavelength associated with the first wesson mass , @xmath233 .",
    "the approximate value of the second wesson mass is therefore @xmath234 g , which may be interpreted as the mass of the observable universe , whereas it has been suggested that @xmath235 g should be interpreted as a minimum mass scale in nature @xcite .",
    "another way to derive @xmath236 is to note that the temperature and entropy of the de sitter cosmic horizon are given by  @xcite k_bt= , and s= , respectively . using the smarr formula for a non - rotating uncharged black hole , @xmath237",
    "we obtain the mass of the corresponding black hole as @xmath238 which is simply the second ( non - reduced ) wesson mass @xmath236 .",
    "thus , this mass can be naturally interpreted as the maximum possible mass contained within the de sitter horizon , above which the observable universe would collapse to form a cosmic black hole .",
    "in addition , as @xmath239 cm is of the order of the current horizon radius , we may interpret the proposed bound @xmath240 in another way , at least at the present epoch , as stating that no particle can have a compton wavelength larger than the radius of the universe .",
    "however , combining the classical bound on the mass density , eq .",
    "( [ min_dens ] ) , with the compton bound on the radius of a quantum mechanical object @xmath241 leads to a new prediction of a minimum mass scale : @xmath242 this implies the existence of a maximum compton radius : @xmath243    these new critical scales , @xmath244 and @xmath245 , are functions of @xmath246 and @xmath233 or @xmath247 and @xmath232 , respectively .",
    "that is , unlike the wesson masses defined in eq .",
    "( [ wesson ] ) , or their associated length scales , and unlike the planck scales eq .",
    "( [ planck ] ) , each depends on all four ` universal ' constants @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath231 and @xmath25 , simultaneously . using the approximate values given above ,",
    "the new scales can be estimated as @xmath250 for comparison , the current upper bound on the average neutrino mass obtained from the planck mission data is @xmath251 ev @xmath252 g @xcite we may also associate a temperature with a given mass scale via the identification @xmath253 , where @xmath254 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "interestingly , defining the temperature @xmath255 associated with the minimum mass @xmath244 via @xmath256 gives @xmath257 .",
    "this is remarkably close to the current temperature of the cmb radiation , though the numerical value of the constant of proportionality is somewhat arbitrary , here being chosen to match the numerical factor in the einstein - hilbert action .    nonetheless , it is interesting that this mass scale has previously been proposed as a minimum mass for stable dark matter relics , based on loop quantum gravity calculations @xcite .",
    "sub - planck mass loop black hole ( lbh ) solutions have been shown to exist if quantum gravity effects give rise to a quadratic generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) @xcite . in this case , the usual relations between the black hole mass , its horizon and its temperature invert at @xmath258 , so that @xmath259 and @xmath260 for @xmath261 .",
    "such objects behave like ` black atoms ' , but continue to decay via radiation emission until they reach thermal equilibrium with the cmb photon bath @xcite ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we can also use the fact that the planck density must be greater than the minimum classical density , @xmath262 , to place theoretical constraints on the values of @xmath233 and @xmath232 relative to @xmath246 and @xmath247 , respectively , and hence on the value of @xmath25 in terms of the other three constants @xmath248 , @xmath249 and @xmath231 .",
    "the planck density is defined as @xmath263 so that @xmath264 these conditions are satisfied ( by many orders of magnitude ) for the actual values of @xmath232 , @xmath247 , @xmath233 and @xmath246 but it is interesting to note that , regardless of the measured values of @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath231 and @xmath25 , they leave two possible scenarios for stable compact objects which behave quantum mechanically : @xmath265 @xmath266 the horizons of a schwarzschild - de sitter black hole are defined by the equation @xmath267 so that the inner horizon is of the order of the standard schwarzschild radius @xmath268 , whereas the outer horizon is comparable to the horizon of the universe , @xmath232 .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ w - bounds2 ] ) corresponds to the realm of elementary particles , whereas eq .",
    "( [ w - bounds3 ] ) corresponds to objects with the potential to form black holes , if compressed beyond the critical radius implied by eq .",
    "( [ buch_1 ] ) .",
    "( [ w - bounds2 ] ) may have profound implications , since it predicts the existence of a phenomenologically significant length scale @xmath245 which , we may conjecture , demarcates the boundary between quantum mechanical and classical behavior .",
    "this may have implications for the study of gravitational decoherence .",
    "surprisingly , despite the common interpretation of the cosmological constant as a ` gravitational ' phenomenon , relatively little work had been done on this topic in the context of models with @xmath0 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , setting @xmath269 implies @xmath270 which bolsters the claim that @xmath271 should be interpreted as a maximum mass .",
    "by contrast , the classical minimum radius for a gravitationally stable object may either be above or below the maximum compton wavelength : @xmath272 implies that the system behaves like a quantum mechanical ` particle ' , whereas @xmath273 corresponds to the classical regime .",
    "( [ buch_1 ] ) and defining @xmath274 the different regimes may also be defined via the mass of the system , so that @xmath275    in summary , the results obtained above suggest that systems with masses in the range :    * @xmath276 correspond to elementary particles , whose behavior is manifestly quantum mechanical * @xmath277 behave quantum mechanically but have the potential to form black holes ( which continue to behave like quantum ` particles ' ) if compressed below their buchdahl limit * @xmath278 behave classically and have the potential to form black holes ( which continue to behave like classical particles ) if compressed below their buchdahl radius .    in this model , both fundamental particles with mass @xmath276 and stable compact objects with masses @xmath277 behave quantum mechanically : what they have in common is that both have radii @xmath279 .",
    "these conclusions follow from a simple combination of results from classical general relativity and ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "we can also interpret the new length and mass scales in the following way .",
    "let us begin by defining the minimum classical energy density , given in eq .",
    "( [ min_dens ] ) , as the energy density associated with the cosmological constant which , in turn , is the minimum possible energy density of space - time , @xmath280 .",
    "next , we interpret this as a ` sea ' of dark energy particles , each with effective mass @xmath244 and associated compton wavelength @xmath281 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that space is saturated with such particles and that the de sitter vacuum expands in such a way as to maintain the associated energy density , so that @xmath282 substituting for @xmath244 and @xmath245 , respectively , then yields the order of magnitude values defined in eqs .",
    "( [ r_lambda])-([m_lambda ] ) .    hence , by combining standard compton type arguments , which imply a minimum radius for a quantum object with a given mass , with classical buchdahl type bounds for @xmath16 , which imply a minimum mass density , we are led naturally to a picture in which dark energy is composed of a sea of quantum particles with effective mass @xmath283 .",
    "the associated mass density @xmath284 is given by @xmath244 divided by the volume occupied by each particle due to its compton wavelength . in this picture , the dark energy condensation picture discussed in sec . [ jeans ] occurs due to fluctuations which lower the effective mass within a localized region , leading to local over - densities .",
    "this is equivalent to a local softening of the effective equation of state .",
    "it is interesting to observe that in the hierarchy of mass scales @xmath285 , each mass is all related to its ` neighbors ' by the geometric mean @xmath286 , for @xmath287 , where @xmath288 .",
    "an illustration  ( not to scale ) of the mass scale hierarchy is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .        since the geometric relations are _ transitive _ among @xmath289 and @xmath290 triplets , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] also implies that @xmath291 which is straightforward to verifiy directly .",
    "we note that these geometric relations originate from the following three physical constraints : ( 1 ) the size of a classical object is larger than or equal to its compton wavelength , ( 2 ) both a minimum mass and minimum density exist , in general relativity , in space - times with a positive cosmological constant , @xmath224 , and ( 3 ) the maximum mass of a gravitationally stable classical compact object also exists in this scenario .",
    "remarkably , these mass scales also admit other physical interpretations .",
    "as stated above , there exist both sound theoretical reasons and empirical evidence to support the claim that @xmath271 should be interpreted as the maximum possible mass of a de sitter universe .",
    "in addition , it is straightforward to verify that the chandrasekhar mass for a condensate of particles of mass @xmath244 is also equal , up to numerical coefficients of order unity , to @xmath271 . since we require @xmath292 , this is is another way of saying that our ( known ) universe can not collapse and must expand forever , as implied by observations suggesting a phase of accelerated expansion beginning at the current epoch @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that dark matter particles , with mass @xmath244 , formed from the condensation of dark energy , this implies that the _ initial _ dark matter temperature , at the epoch of formation , is equal to the ( constant ) temperature of the dark energy fluid in its original phase . even if this is not the case , by envisaging dark energy as a ` sea ' of quantum mechanical particles , the onset of accelerated expansion then coincides with the point at which the temperature of the thermal bath of photons drops below the temperature associated with the effective mass of the dark energy particles , @xmath244 , for the first time . it would be interesting to further investigate this in the context of thermodynamic interpretations of gravity ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , one may hope to obtain a ` thermodynamic interpretation ' of the coincidence problem , posed by the onset of accelerated expansion at the present time .",
    "we also note that the expression for the minimum radius , @xmath293 m , which is of the same order of magnitude as the classical electron radius @xmath294 , and which was obtained previously , by two different methods , in @xcite , may also be obtained a third way by requiring the density of the universe to be less than the planck density , @xmath295 . in this context",
    ", @xmath296 may be interpreted as the minimum classical radius to which the known universe may be compressed before it exceeds the planck density .",
    "finally , before concluding this section , we note that , using eq .",
    "( [ masb ] ) , we may obtain a further generalization of eq .",
    "( [ min_dens ] ) which is valid in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "an analysis similar to that given above should then yield results valid for any value of @xmath297 .",
    "however , in this case a subtlety may arise , since it has recently been proposed in @xcite that , for space - times with compact dimensions , the compton wavelength changes on scales @xmath298 , where @xmath299 is the length scale of the compactification .",
    "we therefore leave a full analysis of the higher - dimensional case , including both spherically symmetric and non - spherically symmetric space - times , to a later publication .",
    "the existence of dark energy , as proved by a plethora of astrophysical and cosmological observations @xcite , has fundamentally modified the landscape of theoretical physics . if dark energy , represented by a cosmological constant , is one of the major components of the universe , it is a reasonable assumption to include it among the fundamental constants of nature @xcite .",
    "hence , we can extend the set of fundamental constants , which can be taken as the speed of light @xmath249 , the gravitational constant @xmath248 , planck s constant @xmath231 , and the cosmological constant @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the mere existence of the cosmological constant , or , at least , of some form of dark energy , may imply drastic modifications or extensions of the basic laws of physics .",
    "if the set of fundamental constants is enlarged , it follows that there are two different masses that can be constructed from @xmath249 , @xmath248 , @xmath231 and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the first wesson mass , @xmath300 g , may be relevant at the quantum scale , while the second wesson mass , @xmath301 g , has the same order of magnitude value as the observable mass of the universe .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", @xmath271 can be obtained as the upper bound on the mass of a gravitationally stable spherically symmetric object in four - dimensional general relativity in the presence of a positive cosmological constant , @xmath224 , and as the jeans mass of a gravitationally unstable dark energy condensate , respectively .",
    "alternatively , the smarr formula for uncharged non - rotating black holes suggests that the mass of the universe , @xmath302 , follows from thermodynamic properties of the de sitter horizon .",
    "in the present paper , we have extended previous results concerning the buchdahl , jeans and minimum mass limits , derived initially in four space - time dimensions with @xmath224 , to arbitrary @xmath1-dimensional , static , spherically symmetric geometries with generic @xmath303 .",
    "we have shown that such limits exist and are well defined for @xmath304 . moreover ,",
    "the existence of a minimum mass is closely related to the existence of a minimum density . from the investigation of the jeans instability in the framework of a simple newtonian model , we obtained @xmath271 as the critical jeans mass of the dark energy fluid , corresponding to the mass of gravitationally stable dark energy objects . using this result",
    ", we were also obtain a new physical interpretation of the cosmological constant in arbitrary space - time dimensions . from eq .",
    "( [ kj ] ) , by taking the speed of sound @xmath305 in the gravitationally condensed dark energy fluid as approximately equal to the speed of light , @xmath306 , we obtain for the @xmath1-dimensional cosmological constant the expression @xmath307\\left[k_j^{(d)}\\right]^2 $ ] , where @xmath308 is the @xmath1-dimensional jeans radius . hence , from a physical point of view , the @xmath1-dimensional cosmological constant represents the square of the @xmath1-dimensional jeans wave number of the dark energy fluid embedded in a higher dimensional geometry .",
    "in addition , with the use of eq .",
    "( [ const ] ) , the mass of the universe @xmath309 can be expressed , in four dimensions , in terms of the fundamental constants @xmath310 as m_wm_u .",
    "where @xmath311 and @xmath312 are the reduced planck length and mass scales and @xmath294 and @xmath29 are the classical electron radius and rest mass , respectively .    in addition , we investigated the quantum mechanical implications of the existence of both a classical minimum mass and a minimum density . by combining simple compton type arguments for the minimum radius of a quantum mechanical object , @xmath313 , with the classical minimum radius , @xmath314 ( and assuming @xmath315 ) we obtained a new minimum mass scale , @xmath316 g , where @xmath246 denotes the ( non - reduced ) planck mass , which depends on all four ` universal ' constants , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath231 and @xmath25 , simultaneously .",
    "interestingly , the temperature associated with this mass scale is of the order of the present day cmb temperature .",
    "the associated length scale @xmath317 cm , where @xmath247 denotes the ( non - reduced ) planck length , represents the maximum possible compton wavelength of a quantum mechanical object , suggesting an absolute maximum decoherence length associated with ` gravitational ' decoherence through the interaction of the system with omnipresent dark energy .",
    "furthermore , these considerations lead naturally to a model in which dark energy , represented at the classical level by a cosmological constant , exists as a ` sea ' of quantum mechanical particles , each with effective mass @xmath244 and associated compton wavelength @xmath245 . in this scenario ,",
    "the de sitter vacuum expands so as to keep the energy density of the particle ` sea ' , @xmath318 , constant , and the dark energy condensation process corresponds to local fluctuations in the effective mass , which is equivalent to local softening of the equation of state .",
    "interestingly , in the hierarchical set of mass scales thus obtained , @xmath288 , each mass is simply the geometric mean of its nearest neighbors , @xmath319 , for @xmath320 , providing an elegant , though as yet unexplained , geometric relation between the series of fundamental , phenomenologically significant mass scales in nature .",
    "remarkably , by using dimensional analysis , the geometric relations can be shown to originate from the unique dimensionless quantity @xmath321 constructed from the four ` fundamental ' constants .",
    "namely , neighboring masses are separated _ universally _ by roughly @xmath322 orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , we propose that ( ) r_p^2~ ~ ~ 10 ^ -120 , should be taken as the fundamental dimensionless constant .",
    "it is the order of magnitude discrepancy between the expected value of the vacuum energy ( assuming a quantum gravity theory with an energy scale characterized by the planck mass ) and the observed value .",
    "it also has an interpretation as @xmath323 , where @xmath324 is the number of fundamental mass quanta in the universe . in other words ,",
    "if we assume that all particles are made from fundamental mass quanta of the order of the first wesson mass , @xmath233 , there must be @xmath325 of these particles in the current horizon radius .",
    "in this case , there are n",
    "_ = = = n^1/4 ~10 ^ 30 , fundamental mass quanta in each dark energy particle , and n _ = ( ) ^3 = ( ) ^3/2 = = n^3/4 ~10 ^ 90 , dark energy particles within the horizon at the present epoch . hence , the above considerations may ` explain ' ( or at least interpret from a simple physical point of view ) the multiplying factors between the different mass scales in the particle mass hierarchy .",
    "another interpretation of the dimensionless quantity @xmath326 is the ratio between planck area and the area of the cosmic horizon .",
    "holographically , this is the number of quantum gravity bits present on the boundary .",
    "the fact that the total number of bits on the boundary is equal to the total number of quanta in the bulk space indicates that holography is at work in the entire universe .",
    "finally , we note that the existence of mass / density bounds in the asymptotically ads case , when the dark energy satisfies the conditions @xmath327 , has interesting implications from the viewpoint of holographic duality . the maximum mass bound for a given radius guarantees that any object with larger mass will inevitably collapse to form a black hole .",
    "holographically , the maximum mass would correspond to the maximum temperature  ( identified with hawking temperature of the maximum mass black hole ) of the dual gauge matter before the inevitable deconfinement phase transition occurs  @xcite . on the other hand , the existence of a minimum mass and a minimum density determines the conditions under which a gravitationally stable , static object can be formed in the presence of dark energy .",
    "if the average density of the object is too small , it will not be able to support itself gravitationally under the outward pressure . at present , it is unclear what the gauge theory dual of this minimum mass / density should be , since the boundary space is always asymptotically ads regardless of the mass and size of the static star located at the center .",

    "<S> the existence of both a minimum mass and a minimum density in nature , in the presence of a positive cosmological constant , is one of the most intriguing results in classical general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> these results follow rigorously from the buchdahl inequalities in four dimensional de sitter space . in this work , we obtain the generalized buchdahl inequalities in arbitrary space - time dimensions with @xmath0 and consider both the de sitter and anti - de sitter cases . the dependence on @xmath1 , the number of space - time dimensions , of the minimum and maximum masses for stable spherical objects is explicitly obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is then extended to the case of dark energy satisfying an arbitrary linear barotropic equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the jeans instability of barotropic dark energy is also investigated , for arbitrary @xmath1 , in the framework of a simple newtonian model with and without viscous dissipation , and we determine the dispersion relation describing the dark energy@xmath2matter condensation process , along with estimates of the corresponding jeans mass ( and radius ) . finally , the quantum mechanical implications of mass limits are investigated , and we show that the existence of a minimum mass scale naturally leads to a model in which dark energy is composed of a ` sea ' of quantum particles , each with an effective mass proportional to @xmath3 .    * keywords * : extra dimensions ; maximum mass ; star ; minimum mass ; dark energy ; jeans instability </S>"
