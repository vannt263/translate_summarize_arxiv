    "the standard model that explains the widely accepted mechanism responsible for the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) phenomenon is based on the accretion of matter by massive black holes ( bh ) that lie at the centres of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this effect manifests an intense luminosity that can not be explained by energetic processes generated by stars .",
    "there is considerable evidence to suggest that most massive galaxies harbour a central bh @xcite , however not all massive galaxies have agn .",
    "the underlying reason for the observed occurrence or absence of agn in massive galaxy hosts is a question central to agn study and has demanded considerable research effort .",
    "although the precise details of how the gas cooling and migration processes that trigger and influence agn activity remain open to debate , most theoretical models @xcite suggest that all agn have similar inner structure , and diversity mostly depends on the system inclination with respect to the observers line of sight . in this unified scheme ,",
    "this relative geometry determines if broad or narrow line regions are observed .",
    "if the torus is face - on , type 1 features are observed , whereas if it is inclined broad - line ( or type 1 ) features are obscured by the dusty torus , and only type 2 features may be observed . in this research",
    "we select type 2 agn , and in particular we focus on how seyfert 2 accretion activity correlates with galaxy properties in these environments .",
    "the relative contribution of the processes that trigger and influence agn appear to be redshift dependent . in general ,",
    "tidal torques generated during galaxy interactions play a role in providing gas inflows that feed central bhs @xcite .",
    "this could occur during mergers @xcite , or galaxy harassment @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the presence of multiple bh / agn in galaxies provides evidence that gas may even be transported to the centers of galaxies during late stage mergers @xcite .",
    "conversely , secular evolutionary processes in galaxies that lead to disk instabilities also appear relevant since they produce bars , rings , clumps and spiral structures that have been proposed to play a significant role in transferring @xcite material towards galaxy centres , and there is evidence that the growth of these structures may even be enhanced during low mass minor mergers @xcite .",
    "moreover it seems reasonable to consider that during galaxy and agn evolution , more than one of the aforementioned mechanisms may act simultaneously .",
    "it seems clear that environmental factors affect the probability of agn occurrence and unraveling these factors will undoubtedly lead to a more general understanding of agn phenomenology .",
    "considerable progress has recently been made indicating that the galaxy number density around low redshift agn is similar to that around typical low redshift galaxies found away from high density regions such as the centers of galaxy clusters @xcite . moreover , although the density around agn and typical galaxies in the low redshift universe are comparable , interestingly both quasars and agn environments at lower redshift are particularly populated by blue , disk - type and star - forming galaxies compared to those in the vicinity of typical galaxies up to scales of @xmath1 @xcite .    in low density environments the growth of disk instabilities occurs more preferentially than in denser environments because abrupt dynamical effects ( ram pressure stripping , tidal forces , galaxy harassment , major merging , etc ) frequently found in galaxy cluster centres are less efficient in removing and heating baryons .",
    "the decreased merger efficiency in clusters due to the high relative velocities of cluster galaxies is also a factor of agn occurrence @xcite , since the merger rate scales roughly as @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "interestingly agn have also been found between merging clusters @xcite where the merger rate may also be higher if progenitor relative velocities are smaller .    from a different perspective",
    ", @xcite studied the correlation between the detected occurrence of agn and the local and global environment , using a control sample of non - active galaxies restricting several parameters .",
    "this allowed them to draw strong conclusions about the difference between agn host and non - active galaxy properties with respect to environment .",
    "their results indicate that for agn host galaxies the morphology - density relation is less significant in comparison with the full sdss galaxy sample and that agn located closer to cluster galaxies tend to be bluer than an early type control sample .",
    "this , may indicate that agn very close to high density regions need more available gas to effectively feed the central black hole .",
    "@xcite show that environmental differences in the nearby universe are present in the blue and red agn population tails when compared to typical galaxy environments selected to have similar host colour , redshift , luminosity , stellar mass ( @xmath3 ) , and mean stellar age .",
    "the comparative results of @xcite reveal the presence of a dichotomy : extremely red agn hosts typically reside in lower density environments than their non - active red control sample that contain a lower fraction of blue star - forming galaxies .",
    "the blue samples , both agn and non - agn , on the other hand have similar galaxy number densities , specific star - formation rates and blue galaxy fractions .",
    "interestingly the morphology of both blue samples , agn hosts and non - active galaxies are significantly different such that a higher fraction of early - type galaxies are found to host agn as shown in their figure 5 .",
    "even though the morphologies of the red samples are similar this is not reflected in their environments , therefore , the notion of host - agn co - evolution seems plausible , since different processes may simultaneously affect the evolution of both the host and agn and these appear to be connected to environment . in this",

    "the purpose of this study is to determine the characteristic nature of the galaxy environment that favors seyfert 2 occurrence and the dependence with the accretion rate of the bh . to do this",
    "we discriminate our seyfert 2 sample according to this parameter .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in section 2 we briefly describe the seyfert 2 classification scheme .",
    "section 3 describes the seyfert 2 subsamples host properties , their dependence with the accretion rate efficiency and the control samples selection .",
    "section 4 analyses the galaxy colours and number density of galaxies surrounding our host seyfert 2 subsamples . in section 5",
    "we compare the surrounding galaxy mass distribution around the subsamples .",

    "the method for emission - line measurement is detailed in @xcite .",
    "additionally , we have corrected the emission - line fluxes for optical reddening using the balmer decrement and the @xcite dust curve .",
    "we assume an @xmath15 and an intrinsic balmer decrement @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "since the true uncertainties in the emission - line measurements were underestimated the signal - to - noise ( @xmath17 ) of every line was calculated with the emission - line flux errors adjusted according to the uncertainties suggested by the mpa / jhu cataloguedata.html ] .",
    "it is important to mention that although seyfert 1 galaxies are not included in the main sdss galaxy sample from which we derive the seyfert 2 agn , some seyfert i contamination can be expected . in seyfert 1",
    "the continuum is affected by non - thermal emission difficulting the proper observation and study of their host galaxy .",
    "so , the rejection of type 1 agn from the galaxy sample , automatically done by the sdss spectral classification algorithm using principal component analysis goes some way in purifying our sample .",
    "@xcite , by inspection of the spectra of the most powerful agn , estimates a contamination of approximately 8% of type 1 agn in the sample using a similar catalogue from an earlier release .",
    "the redshift range of the main sample of emission - line galaxies was restricted to : @xmath18 .",
    "the lower limit prevents that small fixed - size apertures affects galaxy properties as derived by the fiber spectra , and the upper limit corresponds to the luminosity completeness limit for the sdss sample .",
    "furthermore , we conservatively include only galaxies with signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath19 for all the lines used in the three diagnostic diagrams to discriminate seyfert 2 from star - forming and liner galaxies .",
    "we note that the s / n cut was selected even though the adjusted uncertainties almost duplicate the original errors and moderately reduce our available sample , however in being more conservative we can be more confident of liner , seyfert 2 and starburst host membership , their respective properties as derived and conclusions drawn .",

    "this is accomplished by comparing our seyfert - lr and seyfert - hr neighbourhoods with those neighbourhoods of two control samples selected to match the distribution of redshift , luminosity , colour , stellar mass , age and sersic index of the seyfert hosts .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows : + 1 ) even though both seyfert 2 samples produce a large energy output from bh accretion , both samples are found to be in different stages of evolution as can be inferred from their host properties .",
    "however , when the environmental properties are considered and compared to those of the control samples , environmental features are revealed that are likely to be related to @xmath28 selection .",
    "\\2 ) both seyfert 2 samples have bluer environments than their respective control samples , where the fraction of blue galaxies with @xmath81 around seyfert - hr and seyfert - lr are similar and constant with projected distance to targets .",
    "however the difference of the blue galaxy fraction between seyfert - lr and control - lr samples is significantly higher than that between seyfert - hr and control - hr .",
    "in addition , the differential mass profiles of blue neighbouring galaxies around the target samples indicate that their stellar masses are indistinguishable .",
    "however , the stellar mass profiles of the red galaxy neighbours show that the stellar mass of red galaxies around seyfert samples is lower that that around the control samples .",
    "this effect is stronger between seyfert - lr and control - lr at @xmath82 reaching an excess at the 5@xmath83 level at smaller scales .",
    "this result suggests that the environment could compensate any gas deficiency of the host galaxies , while at the same time sustaining agn activity .",
    "it should be noted that although agn feedback processes can not be excluded , it is the environment of seyfert - lr the most different with respect to that of the respective control sample , as it is evident from fig .",
    "\\3 ) the previous results are reflected in the fact that seyfert 2 galaxies reside in low density environments .",
    "there are several possibilities to explain these effects : ( i ) in low density environments gas is not likely to be lost due to stripping which can have an important impact in higher density regions ( ii ) the expected higher galaxy merger rate in low density environments allows fresh gas to be accreted ; and ( iii ) galaxy instabilities are also more probable in less dense environments to provide material that feed bhs , ( iv ) instabilities may even be enhanced by tidal torques that occur in encounters with low mass galaxies .",
    "\\4 ) the stellar mass of blue neighbours shows a small excess around seyfert 2 samples with respect to control galaxies at low densities .",
    "the opposite is observed at higher densities of @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 where seyfert - hr have systematically blue neighbours with a lower stellar mass content .",
    "while for red neighbours at low densities the stellar mass of seyfert 2 and control samples are indistinguishable , at @xmath88 the stellar mass around seyferts is lower than for the control , reaching a difference at the 2@xmath83 level ( seyfert - hr vs control - hr ) , and at 6@xmath83 ( seyfert - lr and control - lr ) , at higher densities .",
    "\\5 ) finally , although the low galaxy density found around seyfert 2 within @xmath89 is independent of the stellar mass of the host galaxies and slightly higher for seyfert - lr , in the vicinity of galaxies of the control samples a significant difference between control - hr and control - lr is found . this would suggest than agn do not follow the standard morphological - segregation relation expected for non - active galaxies .",
    "we suggest that agn occurrence is higher in lower density regions due to the combination of a higher merger rate and a relative quiescent nature of the gas - dynamical processes in comparison to high density environments .",
