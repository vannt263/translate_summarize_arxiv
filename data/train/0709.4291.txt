    "we let @xmath12 : w_i > w_{i+1 } \\}|\\ ] ] denote the number of descents in @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding generating function @xmath14 is known as an _ eulerian polynomial _ , although this definition differs from the classical one by a power of @xmath15 .",
    "some interesting features of the eulerian polynomials include the facts that they have symmetric and unimodal coefficients and are known to have all real roots .",
    "more generally , if @xmath2 is any finite coxeter group with simple reflections @xmath16 ( such as the symmetric group @xmath17 with simple transpositions @xmath18 ) , then a descent in some @xmath19 may be defined as an index @xmath9 such that @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the minimum length of an expression for @xmath13 as a product of simple reflections .",
    "thus there is an analogous _ @xmath2-eulerian polynomial _",
    "@xmath22 where @xmath23 is defined to be the number of descents in @xmath13 .",
    "note that as a coxeter group , @xmath6 is often denoted @xmath24 , so this notation is consistent with  .    like the classical eulerian polynomials ,",
    "the @xmath2-eulerian polynomials are known to have symmetric and unimodal coefficients .",
    "an elegant explanation of this fact may be based on a topological interpretation of @xmath25 as the @xmath4-polynomial of the coxeter complex of @xmath2 .",
    "since every ( finite ) coxeter complex is realizable as the boundary complex of a simplicial polytope , the symmetry and unimodality of the coefficients of @xmath25 may thus be seen as a consequence of the @xmath26-theorem ( e.g. , see section iii.1 of  @xcite ) .",
    "recently , several authors ( see for example @xcite ) have identified interesting classes of simplicial complexes whose @xmath4-polynomials have expansions of the form @xmath27 where the coefficients @xmath28 are nonnegative .",
    "it is easy to see that each summand in this expansion has symmetric and unimodal coefficients centered at @xmath29 , and thus any @xmath4-polynomial with a nonnegative `` @xmath5-vector '' in this sense necessarily has symmetric and unimodal coefficients . in these terms , the @xmath4-polynomials of all finite coxeter complexes ( i.e. , the @xmath2-eulerian polynomials ) are known to have nonnegative @xmath5-vectors  @xcite .",
    "another feature of @xmath5-nonnegativity is that it is a necessary condition for a polynomial to have all real roots , given that the polynomial has nonnegative symmetric coefficients .",
    "in this direction , brenti  @xcite has conjectured that the @xmath2-eulerian polynomials have all real roots , a result that remains unproved only for the groups @xmath30 .    in this paper",
    ", we study a family of eulerian - like polynomials associated to irreducible affine weyl groups .",
    "these `` affine '' eulerian polynomials may be defined as generating functions for `` affine descents '' over the corresponding finite weyl group .",
    "an affine descent is similar to an ordinary descent in a weyl group , except that the reflection corresponding to the highest root may also contribute a descent , depending on its effect on length .",
    "the affine eulerian polynomials have a number of interesting properties similar to those of the ordinary @xmath2-eulerian polynomials .",
    "in particular , we show that they have nonnegative @xmath5-vectors ( theorem  [ thm : gamnonn ] ) , and conjecture that all of their roots are real .",
    "perhaps the most interesting similarity is that each affine eulerian polynomial is the @xmath4-polynomial of a naturally associated relative cell complex ( theorem  [ thm : torus ] ) .    to describe this complex",
    ", one should start with an irreducible affine coxeter arrangement .",
    "such an arrangement induces a simplicial decomposition of the ambient space ; by taking the quotient of this space by the translation subgroup of the associated affine weyl group , one obtains a torus decomposed into simplicial cells .",
    "we refer to this cell complex as the _ steinberg torus _ in recognition of the work of steinberg , who gave a beautiful proof of bott s formula for the poincar series of an affine weyl group by analyzing the action of the finite weyl group on the homology of this complex in two different ways ( see section  3 of  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , steinberg also allows the possibility of twisting the entire construction by an automorphism , but we will not consider this variation here .    it is important to note that the steinberg torus is",
    "not a simplicial complex ( distinct cells may share the same set of vertices ) , but it is at least a boolean cell complex in the sense that all lower intervals in the partial ordering of cells are boolean algebras . for further information about boolean complexes ,",
    "see  @xcite and the references cited there .    for our purposes , it is essential to omit the empty cell of dimension @xmath31 from the steinberg torus ; we refer to the resulting relative complex as the _ reduced steinberg torus_. it is this complex whose @xmath4-polynomial is the corresponding affine eulerian polynomial ; i.e. , the generating function for affine descents .",
    "it is noteworthy that affine descents in finite weyl groups were first introduced by cellini  @xcite in a construction of a variant of solomon s descent algebra , and developed further for the groups of type @xmath32 and @xmath33 in several follow - up papers on `` cyclic descents '' by cellini  @xcite , fulman  @xcite , and petersen  @xcite .",
    "in very recent work , lam and postnikov  @xcite study a weighted count of affine descents ( the `` circular descent number '' ) that coincides with an ordinary count ( only ) in type @xmath32 .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : prelim ] introduces the necessary definitions , including details of the construction of the steinberg torus . in section  [ sec : affe ] we show that the affine eulerian polynomials are the @xmath4-polynomials of reduced steinberg tori ( theorem  [ thm : torus ] ) .",
    "although we do not know of any conceptual topological explanation for the nonnegativity of the @xmath4-vector , we do show that reduced steinberg tori are partitionable ( remark  [ rmk : partition ] ) ; this is a weak analogue of shellability that implies @xmath4-nonnegativity .    in section  [ sec : rrgp ]",
    ", we present our second main result ; namely , that the affine eulerian polynomials have nonnegative @xmath5-vectors ( theorem  [ thm : gamnonn ] ) . as a corollary , it follows that the @xmath4-vectors of reduced steinberg tori are symmetric and unimodal . in this section",
    ", we also present evidence supporting our conjecture that all roots of affine eulerian polynomials are real .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : gamnonn ] is case - by - case , and relies on combinatorial expansions for the @xmath5-vectors of affine eulerian polynomials for the classical weyl groups that we provide in section  [ sec : comb ] . in this latter section",
    ", we also provide combinatorial expansions for the flag @xmath4-polynomials of reduced steinberg tori , one of which suggests the possibility that a natural class of ( reduced ) polyhedral tori may have nonnegative @xmath34-indices ( see question  [ quest : cd ] ) .    in section  [ sec : ident ]",
    ", we present three unexpected identities relating ordinary and affine eulerian polynomials ( two new , one old ) , and use these to derive exponential generating functions for the affine eulerian polynomials for each classical series of weyl groups .",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with the basic theory of reflection groups .",
    "we follow the notational conventions of  @xcite .",

    "the latter generates a finite coxeter group @xmath2 ( a weyl group ) .    unless stated otherwise , we always assume that @xmath35 and @xmath2 are irreducible .    for convenience ,",
    "we assume that @xmath45 spans @xmath36 .",

    "negative_. we write @xmath46 or @xmath47 accordingly .    the affine weyl group @xmath48 is generated by reflections @xmath49 through the affine hyperplanes @xmath50 alternatively , one may construct @xmath48 as the semidirect product @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the lattice generated by all co - roots @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , acting on @xmath36 via translations .",
    "given that @xmath35 is irreducible , it has a unique highest root @xmath55 , and it is well - known that @xmath48 is generated by @xmath56 and that @xmath57 is an irreducible coxeter system .    note that @xmath48 depends on the underlying root system @xmath35 ( not merely @xmath2 ) , so we are committing an abuse of notation .",
