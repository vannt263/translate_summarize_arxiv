    "magnetic fluid hyperthermia ( mfh ) has gained wide interest in its applicability in medical sciences @xcite . enhancing specific absorption loss ( sar ) by core - shell nanostructures ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite or via anisotropy @xcite are also extensively studied .",
    "furthermore , efficiency of circularly polarized field opposed to linearly polarized field is also investigated by models @xcite and experiments @xcite as well .",
    "an interesting study of the chain formation of nanoparticles can be read in the paper of he @xcite , examining the possibility of data storage .    in mfh ,",
    "the basic question is how to describe energy losses . in the literature relaxation and hysteresis losses",
    "are distinguished though both proportional to the area of hysteresis curve .",
    "see also the comment about it in the paper of carrey _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , in which they also argue the necessity of distinction .",
    "the relaxation losses could originate either turning the single - domain particle with its magnetic momentum , called brownian relaxation , or the nanoparticle itself is fixed but its magnetic momentum aligns to the external field , as in the case of nel relaxation .",
    "there is a vivid dispute , whether both relaxations contribute to the losses and if so , to what extent .",
    "also in the paper of wang _ _ et al.__@xcite , they compared sar values for nanoparticles with and without polymerization , and they found no change in the sar value excluding the possibility of brownian relaxation .",
    "furthermore from theoretical considerations , at typical size of nanoparticles up to few tens nanometers of diameters , depending on the experimental conditions , nel relaxation is regarded to be the dominant process .",
    "it is also a question , whether a single independent particle or statistical ensemble of particles should be taken into account .",
    "the single particle picture has the advantage of ab initio description , though in this case no temperature and therefore thermal fluctuation is included yet @xcite , while in the statistical picture the treatment is phenomenological @xcite .",
    "shliomis @xcite provided a complex equation of motion of the magnetization from hydrodynamical considerations , but as we saw till now , radical simplifications were used leaving only the debye - term of the equation , see e.g. paper of cantillon - murphy _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "stochasticity can also be included @xcite for a more elaborated picture of possible relaxation processes .",
    "aim of this paper is to test the validity of magnetization dynamics model with larmor - precession term included @xcite in comparison with experimental results @xcite . in the model",
    "the so - called bloch - bloembergen equation@xcite is rewritten for the single domain nanoparticle magnetization .",
    "we show that experimental results can be understood by the polidispersity of size of nanoparticles .",
    "doe to analytic solution for both linearly and circularly polarized fields , the model is unique being valid without restrictions to any parameter value .",
    "for example , in the paper of mehdaoui _ _ et al.__@xcite , a combined theoretical and experimental study was conducted , in which linear response theory and stoner - wohlfarth model were used , according to their range of validity .",
    "we provided reliable sar values with our model both in the range of linear response theory and stoner - wohlfarth model .",
    "for practical reason , we focus on hyperthermia application and carried out our analysis and evaluation at lower field strength and frequency region . in this case we can claim the equivalence of linearly and circularly polarized field for sar .",
    "finally , dominance of nel relaxation with respect to brownian relaxation is also discussed .",
    "the basic equation of motion of the magnetization is given as ,    @xmath0    here @xmath1 is the gyromagnetic ratio with value @xmath2 am@xmath3/js .",
    "it comes from eq.([dynamicsm ] ) that any change of the magnetization is perpendicular to @xmath4 and for constant @xmath5 the angle between the two vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 is also constant .",
    "the solution is the precessing @xmath4 around @xmath5 for this equation of motion , yielding the _ larmor precession _",
    ", where @xmath6 .",
    "here @xmath7 is the projection of @xmath4 on the plane perpendicular to @xmath5 .",
    "the larmor frequency is defined as a positive quantity , @xmath8 .",
    "shliomis in @xmath9 @xcite has suggested the equation of exponential relaxation to be written for describing the behaviour of magnetic nanoparticles in ferrofluids at given conditions ,    @xmath10    where @xmath4 is the average magnetization of the particles ,    @xmath11    @xmath12 is the particle volume , @xmath13 is the unit vector along @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the saturation magnetization of the colloid @xmath16 , with volume fraction @xmath17 and the single - domain magnetic nanoparticle magnetization @xmath18 .",
    "the langevin function , @xmath19 , gives the magnitude of the magnetization in thermal equilibrium , where @xmath20 must be an ensemble average and so is @xmath4 .",
    "the eq.([debye ] ) is the reduced form of the shliomis relaxation equation @xcite and often called debye relaxation equation .",
    "susceptibility is frequently approximated with rosensweig s chord susceptibility @xcite ,    @xmath21    instead of the langevin function appearing in eq.([meq ] ) , where actual magnetic field is used contrary to its maximum .",
    "the debye relaxation equation , eq.([debye ] ) , can be regarded as a simplified version of the bloch - bloembergen equation @xcite , which describes nuclear magnetic resonance experiments @xcite and ferromagnetic resonance @xcite .",
    "the latter does include the gyromagnetic torque , @xmath22 .",
    "the bloch - bloembergen alike formalism was used in paper @xcite for the description of the dynamics of magnetization of paramagnetic nanoparticles in ferrofluids .",
    "it is pointed out that at field strengths and frequencies used in mfh , the linearly and circularly polarized fields can be equivalent up to a normalization constant , which holds for the interested hyperthermia region in this paper .",
    "analytical solutions of bloch - bloembergen alike equations are briefly summarized here for circularly and linearly polarized fields :    @xmath23    with @xmath24 as given in eq.([meq ] ) . for details of the derivation of equations ,",
    "see paper @xcite .",
    "setting rotating magnetic field , @xmath25 , the solution is :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and @xmath28 . calculating the energy loss per cycle ,    @xmath29    the specific absorption rate ( sar ) is defined as energy loss for unit time and mass :    @xmath30    in case of linearly polarized field , @xmath31 ,",
    "the solution for @xmath32 is found in the form of effective magnetization :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the bernoulli numbers [ ref .  , p.1040 and p.1045 ] and the argument of the langevin function @xmath36 respectively .",
    "the energy loss per cycle is    @xmath37    and the corresponding sar is    @xmath38",
    "in this chapter our model predictions are compered to experimental data .",
    "all the parameters can be found in more detail in references .",
    "first of all , we highlight the paper of mehdaoui _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , because they included very detailed information on polydispersity of their samples and thorough analysis of their measurement .",
    "it provided great opportunity to test our model with polydispersity built in .",
    "excellent agreement was found and it encouraged us to analize other resutls when polydispersity is mentioned but no additional data are given .",
    "log - normal distribution was used like in the paper of mehdaoui _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , as particle size could take only non - negative values .",
    "fitting log - normal distribution to experimental data , we can conclude not only the possible standard deviations from the average value but also might distinguish among samples fabricated by different processes .    analyzing samples from mehdaoui _",
    "et al . _ , see table [ tab : mehdaoui ] , we found excellent agreement both for sar and standard deviation reproducing also the particle size distribution with our model .",
    "used samples with mean radius @xmath39 nm , @xmath40 nm and @xmath41 nm and found ferromagnetic behavior with @xmath42 nm . table [ tab : mehdaoui ] shows an other very important feature of our model providing reliable sar values out of the range of linear response theory , where originally stoner - wohlfarth model was used instead . accordingly we carried out analytical simulation for direct comparisons with experiments instead of numerical ones .",
    "finally , we included polydispersity in our model .    .sar",
    "( w / g ) values are compared for different nanoparticles sizes .",
    "sar from paper mehdaoui _",
    "@xcite ( @xmath43 ) and sar calculated taking nel - relaxation time ( @xmath44 ) only are shown .",
    "log - normal distribution is taken .",
    "their standard deviations are also given by mehdaoui _",
    "( @xmath45 ) and by us ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the possible deviations from the mean value ( @xmath47 ) are given in the last row . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we compared our model predictions to a series of data taken from wang _ et al .",
    "we experienced the same tendencies as before .",
    "the consideration of brownian relaxation process exclusively did not explain the experimental data .",
    "contrary , taking nel relaxation alone , resulted in slight underestimation of measured values , the error was within @xmath48 .",
    "it might worth be note , the absolute value of variation of the particle size from the mean value is nearly constant , which could be explained by having samples fabricated with the same technique .",
    "contrary the samples of mehdaoui _ et al .",
    "_ were prepared differently , and according to it , their standard deviations of particle sizes differ markedly .",
    "the asymmetry of the variation of particle size from the mean value can be explained by the asymmetry of the log - normal distribution .",
    "wang _ et al .",
    "_ also estimated the optimum size for reaching the maximum of sar being at @xmath49 nm , based on the linear response theory and rosensweig s susceptibility . from our model",
    ", we got @xmath50 nm for the optimum size to get resonance , which size is in excellent agreement with the estimations given by wang _",
    "et al._. we note , that at the resonance the sar is @xmath51 , see fig.[fig : janosfalvi_fig1 ] . the same curve can be seen on logarithmic scale , fig.[fig : janosfalvi_fig2 ] , to highlight the tendency for small nanoparticles .",
    "nm with @xmath52 w / g . ]",
    "the aim of this paper was to show the effect of size polydispersity on the specific absorption loss in a magnetic nanoparticles containing media .",
    "for the first time , analytic calculations were carried out instead of numerical simulations , using a bloch - bloembergen alike model , developed and described detailed in paper @xcite . as a reference , the paper of mehdaoui _ et al . _",
    "was used for direct comparison , including nanoparticles @xmath42 nm , the range of stoner - wohlfarth model beyond linear response theory .",
    "we found excellent agreement , see table[tab : mehdaoui ] .",
    "based on this agreement , we estimated the possible mean value and standard deviation of particle sizes for other experiments of wang _ et al .",
    "_ , hergt _ et al .",
    "_ and suto _ et al .",
    "_ , see table[tab : withpoly ] . for the sake of comparison , the sar values were calculated also without polydispersity , table[tab : nopoly ] , and we found drastic improvement when polydispersity was included .",
    "our analytical approach predicted the resonance in the experiment of wang _",
    "et al._. after analyzing standard deviations from mean value of particle sizes , samples fabricated by different technologies might be distinguished , see experiments of mehdaoui _ et al . _ and wang _ et al . _",
    "it can be concluded , the polydispersity is inevitable in experiments and it should be taken into account in models for calculating sar as well .",
    "the case of pure brownian relaxation is excluded .",
