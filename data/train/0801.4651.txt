    "the unification of the electromagnetic and weak interactions in 1968  @xcite , the discoveries of the neutral currents in 1973  @xcite , of the charm quark in 1974  @xcite , of the  and  bosons in 1983  @xcite were very successful steps for the theory of the electroweak ( ew ) interactions , the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "after the discoveries of the top quark in 1995  @xcite and the tau neutrino in 2000  @xcite the electroweak sm became the commonly accepted theory of the fundamental electroweak interactions .",
    "it is a gauge invariant quantum field theory based on the symmetry group @xmath0 , which is spontaneously broken by the higgs mechanism .",
    "the renormalizability of the sm  @xcite allows us to make precise predictions for measurable quantities at higher orders of the perturbative expansion , in terms of a few input parameters .",
    "the higher - order terms , radiative corrections ( rc ) or quantum corrections , contain the self - coupling of the vector bosons as well their interactions with the higgs field and the top quark .",
    "their calculation provides the theoretical basis for the ew precision tests .    in the last thirty five years in high energy physics",
    "two distinct and complementary strategies have been used for gaining new understanding of the nature :    * the direct discovery of the new phenomena at high energy accelerators * the precision measurements of the known phenomena at existing accelerators with high luminosity    the excellent example is the ratio ( fig .",

    "both strategies have worked very well for the studies of the ew interactions first at sps and lep1/slc , and later at lep2/sld and the tevatron , and in the future such interplay of the proton and electron colliders will be applied for the lhc and ilc / clic .",
    "the second strategy has always demanded from the theory the prediction of physical quantities with high precision , @xmath1 at the level of quantum corrections . for the interpretation of the precision experiments",
    "the rc play the crucial role .",
    "in the context of the sm any electroweak process can be computed at tree level from  ( the fine structure constant measured at values of   @xmath2 close to zero ) ,  ( the w - boson mass ) ,  ( the z - boson mass ) , and  ( the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa flavor mixing matrix elements )  @xcite .    when higher order corrections are included , any observable can be predicted using the on - shell renormalization scheme  @xcite as a function of : & = & ( , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , v_jk ) , where the effects of heavy particles do not decouple , and there is the sensitivity to the top mass  @xcite and to less extend to the higgs mass  @xcite .",

    "2 )  @xcite the calculation of the ew rc has been theoretically well established and many higher - order contributions of the radiative corrections have become available over past decades to improve and stabilize the sm predictions .",
    "the experimental data for testing of the ew theory have achieved an impressive accuracy . after taking the measured  mass , besides  and  ( the fermi constant measured in the muon decay ) , for completion of the input , & = & ( 91.18750.0021 ) , + _ & = & ( 1.166 371 0.000 006 ) 10 ^ -5 ^ -2 , + ^-1 & = & 137.035 999 7100.000 000 096 each other precision observable provides a test of the electroweak theory ( fig .",
    "the predictions are calculated with computer programs zfitter  @xcite and topaz0  @xcite , which incorporate state - of - the - art calculations of the ew , qed and qcd radiative corrections .",
    "theoretical predictions of the sm depend on the mass of the top quark and of the as yet experimentally unknown higgs boson through the virtual presence of these particles in the loops . as a consequence",
    ", precision data can be used to pin down the allowed range of the mass parameters .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "4 , which compares the information on  and  obtained at lep1 and sld , with the direct measurements performed at lep2 and the tevatron .",
    "the measured at tevatron mass  @xmath5  @xcite agrees better than 10 % with the value predicted within the sm on the basis of the precision ew measurements .            taking all direct and indirect data into account , one obtains the pillar of the precision electroweak physics  @xcite : the best constraints on the possible mass  of unseen higgs . the global electroweak fit results in the @xmath6 curve shown in fig .",
    "the lower limit on  obtained from direct searches is close to the point of minimum @xmath7 . at 95% c.l .",
    ", one gets  @xcite 114.4 < < 160 .     versus , from the global fit to the ew data .",
    "the vertical band indicates the 95% exclusion limit from direct searches @xcite.,width=226 ]",
    "in the on - shell scheme @xcite the three - level formula @xmath8 is a definition of the renormalized @xmath9 to all orders in perturbation theory , @xmath1 , ^2_w^ ^2 = 1 - _ ^2_^2 .",
    "a precise determination of the on - shell ew mixing angle has been performed by the nutev collaboration  @xcite for the first time through the measurements of the pashos - wolfenstein ratio @xcite : r^- & & from deep inelastic neutrino scattering on isoscalar targets .",
    "the nutev collaboration finds @xmath10 which is 3.0 @xmath11 higher than the sm predictions .    from this experimental value one obtains the mass of  boson  @xcite = 80.14 0.08 which is smaller than other measurements of  at lep / sld and the tevatron ( see fig .",
    "6 ) .",
    "the nutev result should be considered as preliminary until a reanalysis of data will be completed including all experimental and theoretical information .",
    "apart from the still missing higgs boson , the sm provides an elegant theoretical framework for the description of the known experimental facts in particle physics .",
    "the sm has been impressively confirmed by successful collider experiments at the particle accelerators lep , slc and tevatron during the last fifteen years .",
    "future colliders like the upcoming lhc or an ilc / clic offer great prospects , and in turn represent a great challenge for theory to provide even more precise calculations .",
    "accurate predictions are necessary not only to increase the level of precision of sm tests , but also to study the indirect effects of possible new particles .",

    "i am grateful to j. vidal for support and to d. hertzog , z. hioki and a. shiekh for remarks and comments ."
