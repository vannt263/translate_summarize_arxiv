    "by the integral expression of the gamma function @xmath1 , hurwitz s zeta function @xmath2 is obtained by the mellin transform of the generating function @xmath3 of bernoulli polynomials @xmath4 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath5 for any @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 is represented also as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a contour along the real axis from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , counterclockwise around the circle of radius @xmath12 with center at the origin , and then along the real axis from @xmath12 to @xmath11 .",
    "this integral representation is straightforward from the idea due to riemann in @xmath13 .",
    "we need this kind of segmentation at @xmath14 for handling delicate relations presented among several @xmath0-series in the discussion . since the contour integral defines an entire function , provides a meromorphic continuation of @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , by the residue theorem , one shows that @xmath8 has a simple pole at @xmath15 with residue @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xmath18 .",

    "though the expression obtained by the binomial expansion has much advantage for describing the location of poles and special values at non - positive integers , it is difficult to determine whether @xmath29 can give a proper @xmath0-analogue of @xmath8 , i.e. , if @xmath30 holds for any @xmath31 .",
    "actually , the proof of the main assertion in @xcite which characterizes such proper @xmath0-analogues among the family of the functions @xmath32 , @xmath33 being a meromorphic function , could be achieved when employing the euler - maclaurin formula together with a careful piece of analysis .",

    "the present study is , however , different from those in @xcite in the sense that our @xmath0-analogue of the zeta function is given by exactly a dirichlet - type @xmath0-series , whereas the @xmath0-analogue in @xcite has some extra term .",

    "the proof of these theorems and corollary are based on the result for @xmath44 ( ) obtained by the poisson summation formula . in the final section ,",
