    "this size segregation is due to the nonequilibrium , dissipative nature of granular media .",
    "granular materials are handled in many industries .",
    "many industrial machines that transport granular materials use vertical vibration to fluidize the material , and the quality of many products is affected by segregation .",
    "size segregation is one of the most intriguing phenomena found in granular physics .",
    "a deeper understanding of this effect is therefore interesting for practical applications , and also represent theoretical challenge .",
    "a series of experiments@xcite and computer simulations@xcite have elucidated different size segregation mechanisms , including vibration frequency and amplitude@xcite ; particle size@xcite and size distribution@xcite ; particle shape@xcite ; and other properties such as density@xcite and elastic modulus@xcite .    several possible mechanisms for size segregation have been proposed .",

    "al . , _ in two dimensions@xcite , under conditions of low amplitude and high acceleration vibration . in this case , both intruder and the small particles are driven up along the middle of the cell , and while the smaller particles are carried down in a convection roll near the walls the intruder remains trapped on the top . in experiments performed by vanel _",
    "et al . , _ in three dimensions , they observed two convective regimes separated by a critical frequency@xcite .",
    "the first regime is associated with heaping and the second regime is similar to the one observed in ref.@xcite .",

    "et al.,_@xcite , have recovered several aspects that are seen in experiments and recognize the lack of a theoretical description of the exact mechanism driving the segregation and the role of convection .",
    "other segregation mechanism is associated to the _ percolation _ of small grains .",
    "based on a monte carlo computer simulation , rosato _",
    "et al.,_@xcite argue that each cycle of the applied vibration causes all the grains to detach from the base of the container .",

    "the intruder contributes to the formation of an arch sustained on small grains on both sides . between each agitation",

    "they observed an oscillating motion of the intruder on the top , which corresponds to the  whale effect \" predicted by pschel and herrmann@xcite .",
    "also , they observed a reverse buoyancy in shaken granular beds .",
    ", _ performed molecular dynamics simulations in two dimensions and studied the effects of intruder size and density on the height , and found no segregation threshold@xcite . recently shishoda and wassgren performed two dimensional simulations to model segregation in vibrofluidized beds@xcite .",
    "they reported an height dependence with the density ratio between the intruder and the surrounding particles . in their model",
    "the intruder position results from a balance between the granular pressure ( _ buoyant _ force ) within the bed and the intruder weight .",
    "their approach is in some sense similar to the model that we propose in this article .",
    "subject to an external force , granular materials locally perform random motions as a result of collisions between grains , much like the molecules in a gas .",
    "this picture has inspired several authors to use kinetic theories to derive continuum equations for the granular flow ",
    "field variables@xcite .",
    "some of these theories have been generalized to multicomponent mixtures of grains@xcite . for different size particles in the presence of a temperature gradient ,",
    "arnarson and willits , found that larger , denser particles tend to be more concentrated in cooler regions@xcite .",
    "this result was confirmed by numerical simulations@xcite . however , this mechanism of segregation is a natural consequence of the imposed gradient of temperature and its not related to the nature of the grains@xcite .    in this article",
    "we address the problem of size segregation using a kinetic theory approach in two and three dimensions ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we consider the case of an intruder particle immersed in a granular bed .",
    "we propose a segregation mechanism based on the difference of densities between different regions of the system , which give origin to a buoyant force that acts on the intruder .",
    "the difference of densities is caused by the difference between the mean kinetic energy among the region around the intruder and the medium without intruder .",
    "the dissipative nature of the collisions between the particles of a granular media is responsible for this mean energy difference , and modifies the mobility of the particles .",
    "the plan of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive a continuum formulation for the granular fluid , and introduce the definition of the  granular temperature \" . in sec .",
    "iii we propose an analytic method to estimate the local temperature in the system . in sec .",
    "iv we introduce the coefficient of thermal expansion . in sec .",
    "v explicit solutions of the time dependence of height and velocity of the large particle are calculated .",
    "we can explain the size ratio dependence of the rise velocity and address the issue of the critical size ratio to segregation . to validate our arguments we make comparisons with previous experimental data .",
    "we consider an intruder particle of mass @xmath1 and radius @xmath2 immersed in a granular bed .",
    "the granular bed is formed of @xmath3 monodisperse particles of mass @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 .",
    "the particles are modeled by inelastic hard disks ( @xmath6 ) or spheres ( @xmath7 ) in a @xmath8dimensional volume @xmath9 of size @xmath10 .",

    "the energy dissipated is proportional to @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the mean velocity of the particles .    in this work",
    "we use a generalized notion of temperature . in a vibrofluidized granular material",
    "a `` granular temperature '' @xmath22 can be defined to describe the random motion of the grains and is the responsible for the pressure , and the transport of momentum and energy in the system@xcite .",
    "the granular temperature @xmath22 is defined proportional to the mean kinetic energy @xmath23 associated to the velocity of each particle @xmath24 we expect a continuum limit to hold for @xmath25 , when the small particles may be considered as forming a granular fluid . in order to develop an analytic study",
    ", we assume that the uniformly heated granular fluid can be described by the standard hydrodynamic equations derived from kinetic theories for granular systems@xcite . in this study",
    ", we focus on a steady state with no macroscopic flow .",
    "the balance equation for the energy is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the flux of energy and @xmath28 is the average rate of dissipated energy due to the inelastic nature of the particles collisions .",
    "the constitutive relation for the flux of energy , @xmath29 defines the thermal conductivity @xmath30 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath31 a uniformly fluidized state can be realized when the granular material is vibrated in the vertical direction , typically as @xmath32 , with the amplitude @xmath33 and the frequency @xmath34 , so that one can define a typical velocity @xmath35 . in the experiments",
    "the excitation is described by the dimensionless amplitude @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "as a first approximation the effect of the external force experienced by the particles due to the gravitational field is neglected in the description of the granular flow .",
    "experimentally this corresponds to the regime @xmath38 .",
    "so , the momentum balance , in the steady state , implies that the pressure @xmath39 is constant throughout the system .    the hydrodynamic equations close with the state equation , the collisional dissipation @xmath28 and the transport coefficients for a granular medium . in the limit @xmath40 the constitutive relations are determined as function of the properties of the small grains .",
    "the transport coefficients are assumed to be given by the enskog theory for dense gases in the limit of small inelasticity .",
    "the total pressure should be essentially equal to that of the small particles , the contribution of the intruder being negligible , since @xmath40 . for a dense system the pressure is related to the density by the virial equation of state , which in the case of inelastic particles is@xcite @xmath41 , \\label{eqstate}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the number density of small grains",

    "the explicit expressions of these prefactors are given in appendix a.    to estimate the collisional dissipation rate @xmath28 we consider the loss of average kinetic energy per collision and per unit time . in a binary collision",
    "the kinetic energy dissipated can be expressed in terms of the granular temperature as @xmath53 .",
    "for the fluid particles , the average collision frequency @xmath54 is proportional to @xmath55 , and we assume that it is given by the enskog collision frequency@xcite @xmath56 this form for the frequency of collisions is justified for a granular medium .",
    "this is a consequence that the average spacing between nearest neighbor @xmath57 is supposed to be less than the grain diameter @xmath58@xcite .",
    "multiplying @xmath59 by the collision rate @xmath54 and the number density @xmath42 , we obtain the collisional dissipation rate @xmath60 for the fluid particles @xmath61 in order to simplify the mathematical notation let us express @xmath60 as @xmath62 where the dissipation factor @xmath63 contains the prefactors which multiply @xmath64 in eq.([gammaf ] ) , this is @xmath65 to understand the essential features of the intruder s presence in the granular medium , it is adequate to adopt a simplified point of view . if the mean velocity of the fluid particles is @xmath66 , the flux of fluid particles which strikes the intruder s surface can be estimate as @xmath67 . multiplying this flux by the area of the intruder @xmath68 , we can calculate the number of fluid particles which strike the surface of the intruder per unit time , and written in terms of the granular temperature we have @xmath69",

    "this is a simple method to estimate the temperature difference between a region with intruder and a region without intruder @xmath77 .",
    "let us concentrate on solutions with radial symmetry .",
    "the solutions of eq.([en - bal ] ) , for an arbitrary dimension @xmath8 , satisfy the equation @xmath78 this nonlinear differential equation can be simplified by the fact that the pressure is considered constant throughout the system and remembering that @xmath79 .",

    "very recently it has been shown experimentally @xcite and by computer simulations@xcite , that the convection phenomenon in granular fluids comes from the effect of spontaneous granular temperature gradients , due to the dissipative nature of the collisions .",
    "this temperature gradient leads to a density variations .",
    "the convection rolls are caused by buoyancy effects initiated by enhanced dissipation at the walls and the tendency of the grains at the center to rise .",
    "so , this segregation mechanism could be described in the hydrodynamic framework proposed in this work subject to the appropriate boundary conditions .",
