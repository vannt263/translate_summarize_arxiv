    "the lsnd observation of anti - neutrino oscillations in the @xmath1 channel  @xcite remains to be confirmed or refuted by an independent measurement .",
    "the lsnd group also observed a statistically less robust signal for neutrino oscillations in a search for @xmath0 candidates  @xcite .",
    "the miniboone group at fermilab is presently collecting data to test the lsnd neutrino oscillation channel @xmath0 using the @xmath4 flux from the decay - in - flight ( dif ) of a horn focused @xmath5 beam produced by 8 gev protons  @xcite .",
    "collection of the positive beam ( neutrino ) sample for their blind analysis will certainly take through 2004 .",
    "the limited proton beam resources at fermilab will be redirected in early 2005  @xcite to other neutrino experiments  @xcite .",
    "this may not leave miniboone enough beam to gather sufficient @xmath4 data and still be able to switch horn polarity and collect data with the lower flux @xmath6 dif source of @xmath7 .",
    "miniboone may end in the unsatisfactory condition of being unable to reach a strong conclusion about the primary lsnd oscillation result in @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , the miniboone signal to background ratio is expected to be less than one , even for for the higher flux @xmath5 dif beam .",
    "the signal rate and quality are expected to be even less for the @xmath6 dif beam , should that configuration be run .",
    "the spallation neutron source ( sns ) is presently under construction at oak ridge national lab .",
    "@xcite the sns beam stop will provide a copious flux of decay - at - rest ( dar ) neutrinos , primarily from @xmath5 and @xmath8 decays .",
    "this neutrino source offers three major improvements over previous beam dump dar neutrino sources .",
    "first , there will be a dedicated proton beam averaging 1.4 mw power operating throughout the year yielding a high total neutrino flux .",
    "second , the beam spill comes within a 695ns interval corresponding to single turn extraction from the proton accumulator ring . this beam spill interval is less than the @xmath8 life time of 2197 ns , but longer than the 26 ns @xmath5 life time , allowing good temporal separation of the @xmath4 from @xmath5 decay and the @xmath9 from @xmath8 decay .",
    "third , the recirculating liquid mercury beam stop quickly absorbs most @xmath6 and @xmath10 before they decay at rest , greatly reduces dif neutrino production , minimizing the associated backgrounds .",
    "the basic parameters of the initial sns beam dump  @xcite neutrino source , and the higher energy source considered at the sns@xmath11 workshop  @xcite are given in table  [ tab : snspars ] .",
    "the sns began construction in 1999 , and is scheduled for completion in 2006 .",
    "full operating intensity should be achieved by 2008 , which is an appropriate time scale to build and commission the detector system described here .",
    "an overview of the sns site plan is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snssite ] .    perhaps more important than neutrino oscillation tests will be a wide range of neutrino - nucleus cross section measurements that can be made in the neutrino oscillation detector discussed here , and in a variety of dedicated single - purpose detectors placed closer to the sns beam stop .",
    "the neutrino energies provided by the beam stop correspond well to the neutrino flux generated in supernov , contributing to heavy element synthesis , the transfer of energy to outer layers of the star , and carrying away up to 99%  of the energy released .",
    "this paper will also address how other transparent erenkov media might be used to measure neutrino - nucleus cross sections in a variety of elements using the sns neutrino flux .",
    "previous studies of neutrino physics with the sns  @xcite led to a white paper  @xcite and a proposal  @xcite for a large general facility known as orland , the oak ridge laboratory for neutrino detectors .",
    "a very large erenkov detector , condor , of up to 2 kilotons mass was considered for precision standard model tests using neutrino - electron elastic scattering , and to study @xmath1 oscillations to the @xmath12 level .",
    "the detector presented here is much smaller than the condor / orland design , and is focused on oscillation tests and neutrino - nucleus cross section measurements .    the neutrino studies at the spallation neutron source ( sns@xmath11 ) workshop held august 28 - 29 , 2003 at oak ridge  @xcite , presents a new opportunity to bring neutrino physics to the great neutrino source that is being built at the sns .",
    "the focus of the workshop was on physics with smaller detectors within the sns target building .",
    "small scale segmented and homogenous detectors for neutrino - nucleus cross section measurements are being considered .",
    "discussion has begun on neutrino detectors to be built within the sns target hall itself , at about 22 meters from the beam stop  @xcite .",
    "proposing a detector at 60 or more meters from the beam stop does make sense for several reasons .",
    "the sns@xmath11 site inside the target hall near the backward direction would offer about 4.5@xmath134.5@xmath136.5 m@xmath3 for all elements of two detectors , one homogenous and one fine grained .",
    "this volume needs to include passive shielding to filter the hadronic component of cosmic rays , active shielding to tag muons , and dead space around the fiducial volume .",
    "limitations on floor loading plus the passive and active shielding would limit the sensitive volume of a homogenous detector to at best 5 to 10 m@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the tight confines would also limit access to detector elements , placing a premium on careful engineering .",
    "a larger homogenous detector at about 60 meters from the beam stop would be outside the target hall and beyond the extended neutron beam lines in most directions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : snssite ] ) . the loss in flux of a factor of about 7.5",
    "would be easily compensated by the ability to make a much larger fiducial volume , at least 30 times greater in this proposal .",
    "passive shielding , in the form of concrete blocks and earth , could be piled as high as needed to reduce cosmogenic backgrounds .",
    "60 meters is , of course , a better distance to test and characterize the lsnd anti - neutrino oscillation signal .",
    "the smaller sns@xmath11 homogenous detector within the target hall should also be built , as a near detector for the oscillation test , as a technology testbed for the larger detector , and as a less expensive platform for measuring larger neutrino - nucleus cross sections .",
    "this paper presents a medium scale detector which would be placed just below the ground surface at least 60 meters from the neutrino source .",
    "the detector would not impinge within 10 meters of the target hall foundations , and requires a final excavation only about 12%  of the orland scale .",
    "the target hall is shown in relation to the rest of the sns site in fig .",
    "[ fig : snssite ] .",
    "the target hall is 60 meters wide , with side walls 30 meters on either side of the beam dump .",
    "the detector presented here could definitively test the lsnd @xmath1 oscillation result , and also cover a range of interesting neutrino - nucleus scattering processes .",
    "both the original lsnd experiment and miniboone have shown that a large imaging erenkov detector can be operated under modest shielding near an accelerator .",
    "other successful imaging erenkov detectors have operated deep underground primarily to reduce cosmic ray induced backgrounds to their non - accelerator physics processes .",
    "a spherical 250 ton fiducial mass of mineral oil ( density 860kg / m@xmath3 ) would have a fiducial radius of @xmath14 , occupying a volume of 291m@xmath3 .",
    "lsnd and miniboone restrict primary events to a fiducial volume 35 cm inside the pmt faces . allowing for an additional 35 cm radius for the pmts and their bases , another 25 cm for an active a veto volume , and 5 cm for the combined thickness of the two tank walls , we get an outer detector radius of about 5.11 meters",
    ". the diameter would be about 33.5 feet , compared to the 40 foot diameter of miniboone .",
    "a drawing of the proposed detector is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : alice ] .",
    "two newer hamamatsu photomultiplier tubes  @xcite offer better charge and time response than the original lsnd pmt s ( see table  [ tab : pmts ] ) . both lsnd  @xcite and the sudbury neutrino observatory",
    "@xcite used r1408 eight - inch pmt s .",
    "the more efficient , better performing r5912 eight - inch pmt has replaced the r1408 in hamamatsu s catalog .",
    "miniboone uses several hundred r5912 8-inch pmts among the older lsnd tubes .",
    "the newer r8055 has a 13-inch photocathode .",
    "the number of tubes needed is calculated based on a 25%  photocathode coverage as used by lsnd to detect and resolve 2.2mev gamma rays from neutron capture on free protons .",
    "miniboone has about 10%  photocathode coverage , allowing reconstruction of michel electrons from stopping muon decay , but can not see the 2.2mev neutron capture signal .",
    "table  [ tab : pmts ] summarizes the properties of the r5912 and r8055 pmts , and gives the number of each type required for 25%  photocathode coverage in the proposed detector .",
    "a 250 ton ( fiducial ) detector at the sns filled with mineral oil , plus butyl - pbd to enhance scintillation light yield , would have @xmath15 free protons .",
    "( which gives about half as many @xmath16c nuclei , @xmath17 . we also get @xmath18 atomic electrons . )",
    "we have used a 7%  energy resolution for electrons at 50 mev in the calculations below . the lsnd detector with",
    "1220 pmts ultimately achieved an energy resolution of 7% at the michel endpoint of 52.8 mev  @xcite .",
    "the original orland facility proposal  @xcite for the sns called for a hole in the ground 110 feet deep by 78 feet in diameter .",
    "this size was required to accomodate a 2kton detector plus several smaller detector for other neutrino - nucleus studies .",
    "the detector described here requires an excavation of at most 40 feet deep by 44 feet diameter , or about 12% of the volume of the whole orland facility .",
    "the detector could be built closer to ground level if sufficient earth for a passive hadron shield is piled overhead .",
    "lsnd had a passive shield of 2000g / cm@xmath11  @xcite , yielding a cosmic muon rate of 4khz in the detector .",
    "miniboone has 18 inches of concrete topped by at 3 meters of earth  @xcite for a total of at least 4000 g / cm@xmath11 of passive shielding .",
    "miniboone experiences a cosmic muon rate of 9.2 khz .",
    "the principle deadtime of both lsnd and miniboone , which use the same readout electronics , arises from a 15 @xmath20sec trigger hold - off after each muon .",
    "greater passive shielding in the form of additional concrete and earth , plus newer readout and greater processing power , should allow a reduction in cosmic muon related deadtime .",
    "lsnd had a non - hermetic 15 cm thick liquid scintillator active veto inherited from the previous e-645 experiment  @xcite , which has a veto inefficiency for charged particles of less than @xmath21 .",
    "gaps in this active veto led to problematic low energy neutron backgrounds from below which complicated initial oscillation analysis .",
    "miniboone uses its working fluid of pure mineral oil without scintillation boosters to form an active veto volume 35 cm thick viewed by 240 pmts .",
    "this hermetic system gives a veto efficiency of about 99.97% , at least an order of magnitude poorer than lsnd s thinner liquid scintillator veto .",
    "the proposed detector has double one - inch steel walls defining the outside of the detector , and the inner active volume .",
    "the veto and active volumes must be separated so that a highly responsive liquid scintillator can be used for an efficient veto for any liquid placed in the inner sensitive volume .",
    "this active veto would be 25 cm thick and hermetic , improving on both lsnd and miniboone experiences .",
    "the veto region can be viewed by several hundred 5-inch pmt s .",
    "both the inner and outer wall of the veto region will be painted reflective white .",
    "the inner surface of the active volume will be painted a non - reflective black .      the lsnd detector , operating with the same event energies expected here , had single electron reconstruction efficiencies which ranged from 40%  to over 50%  depending on the specific analysis . the poor duty factor of the lsnd meant that stringent cuts needed to be applied to separate beam related electron events from non - beam backgrounds .",
    "the much lower duty factor of the sns neutrino flux should allow a single electron efficiency well above 50% .",
    "miniboone faces a different set of problems while identifying electrons at about 500 mev .",
    "muons at this energy also produce erenkov cones , and the neutrinos are energetic enough to produce events with @xmath23s .",
    "a novel application of neural networks has allowed miniboone to achieve an electron efficiency of at least 50%  with good muon and @xmath23 rejection .",
    "neutron tagging , required for the anti - neutrino oscillation analysis , was complicated in the lsnd by the backgrounds sneaking in through gaps in veto coverage . the proposed detector for the sns must have an efficient hermetic veto system .",
    "although electron efficiencies well over 50%  should be possible , we have chosen to parameterize our ignorance using a reconstruction efficiency @xmath22 explicitly in all event rates given .",
    "at a nominal beam power of 1.4mw ( 1300 mev kinetic energy protons ) the sns neutron source will also produce @xmath24 decay - at - rest ( dar ) neutrinos ( @xmath4 , @xmath7 , and @xmath25 ) per beam year .",
