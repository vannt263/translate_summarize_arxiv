    "in this paper we are interested in smooth solutions to the one - dimensional euler - arnold equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a symmetric , positive semi - definite nonlocal differential operator and @xmath3 .",
    "the particular special cases we are interested in are    * the euler - weil - petersson equation  @xcite : @xmath4 or @xmath5 , * and the wunsch equation  @xcite,@xcite : @xmath6 or @xmath7 ,    where @xmath8 is the hilbert transform defined by @xmath9 .",
    "when paired with the flow equation @xmath10 the euler - arnold equation describes geodesics @xmath11 of the right - invariant riemannian metric defined at the identity element by @xmath12 on a homogeneous space @xmath13 .",
    "here @xmath14 is the group generated by the subalgebra @xmath15 of length - zero directions : for the euler - weil - petersson equation we have @xmath16 , and for the wunsch equation we have @xmath17 .",
    "see arnold - khesin  @xcite for the general setup ( which includes also the euler equations of ideal fluid mechanics ) , khesin - misioek  @xcite for the setup for homogeneous spaces , and escher - kolev  @xcite for these two equations in particular .",
    "the local existence result is that if @xmath18 for @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 is the lie algebra of @xmath14 ) , then there is a unique solution @xmath21 for some @xmath22 ( which may be infinite ) . in our context",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the geodesic equation is smooth , so that there is a unique solution @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "loss of smoothness of @xmath26 in time occurs due to the fact that composition required to get @xmath27 is not smooth .",
    "this approach to the euler equations was originally due to ebin - marsden  @xcite ; for the wunsch equation it was proved by escher - kolev - wunsch  @xcite , while for the euler - weil - petersson equation it was proved by escher - kolev  @xcite .",
    "castro - crdoba  @xcite showed that if @xmath28 is initially odd , then solutions to the wunsch equation blow up in finite time ; the authors of @xcite generalized this to show that if there exists any @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , then the solution of the wunsch equation blows up in finite time .",
    "for the euler - weil - petersson equation , it was not known whether initially smooth data would remain smooth for all time .",
    "however gay - balmaz and ratiu  @xcite interpreted the equation in @xmath0 as describing geodesics of a _",
    "strong _ riemannian metric on a certain manifold and concluded that the velocity field @xmath26 remains in @xmath32 for all time .",
    "this is almost but not quite enough to get a global @xmath33 bound , which would guarantee global existence of _ smooth _ solutions along with a smooth lagrangian flow @xmath34 .    in general",
    "the hilbert manifold topology on @xmath35 or related spaces ( e.g. , subgroups or quotients ) is given in terms of the sobolev space norms @xmath36 for @xmath37 , since @xmath38 for @xmath37 ensures @xmath39 .",
    "on the other hand the right - invariant riemannian metric which gives the geometry and the geodesic equation is given in terms of the sobolev @xmath40 norm for some @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath42 then we can use @xmath43 , and we have a strong riemannian metric ; global existence of geodesics in that case was proved by escher - kolev  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath44 then solutions may blow up ; for example the @xmath45 metric on @xmath46 leads to the camassa - holm equation  @xcite which , for some initial data , has solutions that blow up in finite time  @xcite .",
    "the degenerate @xmath47 metric on @xmath48 leads to the hunter - saxton equation  @xcite , for which all solutions blow up in finite time  @xcite .",
    "the main theorems of this paper settle the global existence question for the degenerate @xmath49 metrics corresponding to @xmath50 ( the wunsch equation ) and @xmath51 ( the euler - weil - petersson equation ) .",
    "[ mainthm1 ] suppose @xmath19 and @xmath28 is an @xmath36 velocity field on @xmath52 with mean zero ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) .",
    "then the solution @xmath54 of the wunsch equation with @xmath55 blows up in finite time .",
    "[ mainthm2 ] suppose @xmath19 and @xmath28 is an @xmath36 velocity field on @xmath52 , and that the fourier series of @xmath28 has vanishing @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 component ; i.e. , @xmath59 .",
    "then the solution @xmath54 of the euler - weil - petersson equation with @xmath55 remains in @xmath36 for all time .",
    "in particular if @xmath28 is @xmath60 then so is @xmath54 for all @xmath61 .    additionally , theorem [ mainthm1 ]",
    "almost immediately gives us that every mean zero solution of the constantin - lax - majda equation @xcite blows up in finite time .",
    "overall , these two theorems mean that the case @xmath62 behaves the same as the cases for @xmath42 , while the case @xmath50 behaves the same as for @xmath63 .",
    "we may conjecture that there is a critical value @xmath64 such that for @xmath65 all smooth mean - zero solutions remain smooth for all time , while for @xmath66 all smooth mean - zero solutions blow up in finite time .",
    "our guess is that @xmath67 , but the current method does not prove this ; furthermore we do not know what happens with geodesics for @xmath68 or @xmath69 even in the degenerate case .    both equations arise naturally in the study of universal teichmller spaces .",
    "the euler - weil - petersson equation was derived in @xcite as the euler - arnold equation arising from the weil - petersson metric on the universal teichmller space .",
    "this geometry has been studied extensively by takhtajan - teo  @xcite ; in particular they constructed the hilbert manifold structure that makes weil - petersson a strong hilbert metric ( thus ensuring that geodesics exist globally ) .",
    "the weil - petersson geometry is well - known : the sectional curvature is strictly negative , and it is a khler manifold with almost complex structure given by the hilbert transform .",
    "see tromba  @xcite and yamada  @xcite for further background on the weil - petersson metric on the universal teichmller space .",
    "the wunsch equation arises from the riemannian metric @xmath70 , which is called the velling - kirillov metric and was proposed as a metric on the universal teichmller curve by teo  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the velling - kirillov geometry was originally studied by kirillov - yurev  @xcite ; although the sectional curvature is believed to be always positive , this is not yet proved .",
    "furthermore the geometries are related in the sense that integrating the square of the symplectic form for the w - p geometry gives the symplectic form for the v - k geometry .",
    "yet the properties of these geometries seem to be opposite in virtually every way : from fredholmness of the exponential map  @xcite@xcite to the sectional curvature to the global properties of geodesics mentioned above .",
    "the authors would like to thank martin bauer and boris kolev for suggesting the problem and useful discussions on the result .",
    "let us first sketch the blowup argument for the wunsch equation from @xcite .",
    "the wunsch equation is given for mean - zero vector fields @xmath26 on @xmath52 ( identified with functions ) by the formula @xmath71 in terms of the lagrangian flow @xmath34 given by , we may rewrite this as @xmath72 which leads to the conservation law @xmath73 applying the hilbert transform to both sides of and using the following hilbert transform identities ( valid for mean - zero functions @xmath74 ) : @xmath75 one obtains  @xcite an equation for @xmath76 : @xmath77 where the function @xmath78 is a spatially nonlocal force given for each fixed time @xmath79 by @xmath80 for a mean - zero function @xmath26 , it was shown in @xcite that @xmath81 for every @xmath79 and @xmath82 .",
    "we will give an alternate proof of this fact in theorem [ magicformulathm ] below .",
    "in lagrangian form , using the conservation law equation becomes @xmath83 it follows that if there is a point @xmath84 such that @xmath85 and @xmath86 , then we will have @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for all @xmath79 , so that @xmath90 must reach zero in finite time ( which leads to @xmath91 ) .",
    "our proof that _ all _ solutions blow up consists of showing that this condition happens for _ every _ initial condition @xmath28 with @xmath92 .    from the discussion above",
    ", the proof reduces to proving the following statement .",
    "suppose @xmath93 is a smooth function with mean zero , and let @xmath94 .",
    "then there is a point @xmath29 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "let @xmath97 be the unique harmonic function in the unit disc @xmath98 such that @xmath99 , and let @xmath100 be its harmonic conjugate normalized so that @xmath101",
    ". then in polar coordinates we have the cauchy - riemann equations @xmath102 and we have @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "since @xmath100 is harmonic , its maximum value within @xmath98 occurs on the boundary @xmath52 at some point @xmath84 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath105 occurs at the same point , so that @xmath96 . by the hopf lemma",
    ", we have @xmath106 , so equations imply that @xmath107 .",
    "this argument also works when the domain is @xmath108 and the functions have suitable decay conditions imposed .",
    "it can thus be applied to demonstrate that _ every _ mean zero solution of the constantin - lax - majda equation @xcite @xmath109 blows up in finite time , using the same argument as in that paper via the explicit solution formula .",
    "[ ewprewrite ] the euler - weil - petersson equation is equivalent to the equation @xmath111,\\ ] ] in terms of the lagrangian flow , equation takes the form @xmath112 where @xmath78 is defined by formula and @xmath14 is given by @xmath113.\\ ] ] here the operator @xmath114 is restricted to the orthogonal complement of the span of @xmath115 so as to be invertible .",
    "equation may be written @xmath116 using the product rule .",
    "we now solve for @xmath117 by applying @xmath8 to both sides and inverting @xmath114 . to do this",
    ", we just need to check that the term @xmath118 is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by @xmath115 .",
    "in fact this is true for every function @xmath119 when @xmath74 is @xmath120-periodic with mean zero , since the formulas imply both that @xmath119 has mean zero and that it has period @xmath121 .      to prove theorem [ mainthm2 ] , we want to show that @xmath123 remains bounded for all time , and by formula it is sufficient to bound both @xmath124 and @xmath125",
    ". we will do this in the next two sections .",
    "in fact as @xcite show , this theorem generalizes to any number of derivatives : we have @xmath134 for any @xmath135 , with theorem [ magicinequalityold ] representing the case @xmath136 . although the theorem is not difficult to prove using some simple index manipulations , it is rather mysterious why it works",
    ". the following more explicit formula for the function makes clear why @xmath78 is positive .",
    "[ magicformulathm ] suppose @xmath126 has fourier series @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "let @xmath137 denote the holomorphic function in the unit disc @xmath98 given by @xmath138 , and set @xmath139 ( which is holomorphic in @xmath140 ) .",
    "if @xmath130 , then @xmath141    for each @xmath142 , set @xmath143 .",
    "the cauchy integral formula says that @xmath144 and thus we obtain @xmath145 for any curve @xmath146 around the origin , in particular when @xmath147 . since @xmath142 we know that @xmath148 , and we conclude that @xmath149 using formula , we then have for @xmath150 the formula @xmath151 \\ , d\\overline{v},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the cauchy integral formula on the analytic function @xmath152 .",
    "now plugging in @xmath150 and @xmath153 and computing explicitly , we obtain @xmath154 it is easy to see that for any holomorphic function @xmath155 on @xmath98 , we have @xmath156 and formula follows .",
    "we would now like to bound @xmath78 in terms of @xmath157 .",
    "to do this we use hardy s inequality to replace difference quotients with derivatives , then use the trace theorem to replace derivatives on the disc with half - derivatives on the boundary circle .",
    "first we show the following hardy - type inequality  @xcite : for any @xmath161 and analytic function @xmath137 on @xmath98 , if @xmath139 , then @xmath162 assume without loss of generality that @xmath163 , and write @xmath164 for simplicity .",
    "we have @xmath165 , so that @xmath166",
    ". then we have by cauchy - schwarz that @xmath167 define new variables @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170",
    ". this transformation maps the unit cylinder @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 to the unit cylinder @xmath174 , @xmath175 .",
    "the jacobian transformation is @xmath176 , so that the inequality becomes @xmath177 which evaluates to immediately .",
    "furthermore for any fixed @xmath82 , we will show @xmath178 again without loss of generality we can assume @xmath179 and that @xmath180 .",
    "define @xmath181 ; then we want to show that @xmath182 first we observe that @xmath183 so that equation follows from the standard hardy inequality  @xcite on the interval : @xmath184    now formula combined with and gives @xmath185 now express this in terms of the fourier coefficients @xmath186 , using @xmath187 , and a straightforward computation yields @xmath188 which leads directly to .",
    "expand @xmath74 in a fourier series as @xmath192 , and let @xmath193 .",
    "then we have @xmath194 where @xmath195",
    "now let us simplify @xmath196 : we have for @xmath197 that @xmath198 where we used the substitution @xmath199 . clearly the middle term cancels the last term , so @xmath200 it is easy to see that @xmath201 due to cancellations , while if @xmath202 , we get @xmath203 note in particular that @xmath204 . we thus obtain @xmath205 so that @xmath206    it now makes sense to apply @xmath207 to this function , and we obtain @xmath208 so that @xmath209 where the inequality in the last line is precisely the well - known hilbert double series theorem ( @xcite , section 9.1 ) .",
    "the work of escher and kolev shows that solutions of are global as long as we can control the @xmath33 norm @xmath214 .",
    "this follows from the no - loss / no - gain lemma 4.1 of @xcite and the general estimate for sobolev @xmath215 norms in terms of @xmath33 norms from theorem 5.1 of @xcite .",
    "hence all we need to do is obtain a uniform bound for the @xmath33 norm of @xmath26 . since the @xmath221 seminorm of a solution of is constant by energy conservation ,",
    "it is sufficient to bound the @xmath33 norm in terms of the @xmath221 seminorm .",
    "note that the @xmath32 norm does not in general control the @xmath222 norm of an arbitrary function @xmath74 on @xmath52 ; we need to use the special structure of the equation to get this .",
    "proposition [ ewprewrite ] shows that @xmath223 using theorem [ mysteryboundthm ] , we obtain @xmath224 where @xmath225 , which is constant in time since @xmath26 is an euler - arnold equation . similarly corollary [ gboundcor ]",
    "yields @xmath226 . since @xmath26 is always chosen as the representative of the equivalence class that has @xmath227",
    "( i.e. , its fourier coefficients are only nonzero for @xmath228 ) , we can easily bound both of these lower - order terms above by some constant multiple of @xmath229 .",
    "it follows that @xmath230 , so that @xmath231 , which shows that @xmath210 can not approach infinity in finite time .",
    "this proves that the solution of the ewp equation remains in any @xmath36 space that @xmath28 begins in for any @xmath37 , using theorem [ c1boundthm ] .      in teichmller theory",
    "there is a natural identification between diffeomorphisms of the unit circle and curves in the plane , up to certain normalizations , given by conformal welding .",
    "here we use numerical simulations to map the geodesics corresponding to the wunsch and ewp equations to their respective spaces of curves in @xmath234 , which then correspond to spaces of appropriately normalized conformal maps of the unit disk .",
    "it would be interesting to use this alternative representation of geodesics to prove the results of theorem [ mainthm1 ] directly , since it could generate a new approach to other euler - arnold equations with similar geometric properties for which these results are not known , such as the surface quasigeostrophic equation  @xcite and the 3d euler equation  @xcite .",
    "we really have two different situations where we may apply conformal welding : for the universal teichmller space @xmath232 , and for the universal teichmller curve @xmath233 .      as discussed in sharon and mumford @xcite , for the universal teichmller space @xmath232 , conformal welding",
    "may be thought of as a map @xmath235 where @xmath236 consists of equivalence classes of smooth , closed , simple curves in @xmath234 modulo scaling and translation operations . given a representative @xmath217 of an equivalence class @xmath237\\in \\mathcal{c}$ ] , by the riemann mapping theorem , there exists a univalent , holomorphic function @xmath238 such that @xmath239 .",
    "this function is unique up to precomposition by an element of @xmath240 .",
    "then , we also find a ( this time unique ) holomorphic map @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the exterior of the unit disk , such that @xmath243 , @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "we then define @xmath246",
    "\\mapsto [ \\eta]_{{\\mathrm{psl}}_2(\\mathbb{r})}\\ni \\eta=\\phi_+^{-1}\\circ \\phi_-|_{s^1}\\ ] ] the fact that this map is bijective follows from the construction of its inverse , see sharon and mumford @xcite , or lehto @xcite .",
    "one may construct the inverse by solving a fredholm integral equation of the second kind as in feiszli and mumford @xcite .",
    "one must solve : @xmath247 where @xmath248 and @xmath249 the results of feiszli and mumford @xcite ensure that has a unique solution .",
    "thus we have a practical way of computing @xmath250      alternatively , as discussed in kirillov @xcite and teo @xcite , one may consider conformal welding for the universal teichmller curve , @xmath233 , which may be thought of as a map : @xmath251 where @xmath252 consists of smooth , closed , simple curves in @xmath234 with conformal radius one at the origin .",
    "we then proceed in a similar fashion as before .",
    "this time , when we find a univalent , holomorphic @xmath238 such that @xmath239 , we also demand that @xmath253 be the unique mapping such that @xmath254 and @xmath255 ( which is the normalization demanded by the riemann mapping theorem ) . since @xmath217 has conformal radius one , @xmath256 .",
    "we find @xmath257 in the same way as before , and then have the same definition for @xmath258 as for @xmath259 : @xmath260_{{\\mathrm{rot}}(s^1)}\\ni \\eta = \\phi_+^{-1}\\circ \\phi_-|_{s^1}\\ ] ] where the equivalence class is now taken to be in @xmath48 as opposed to @xmath261 in the case of @xmath259 . that this map is bijective is proved in kirillov @xcite for smooth curves and in teo @xcite for the more general situation of quasicircles .",
    "as mentioned above , our goal was to use numerical simulations to take the lagrangian trajectories corresponding to the wunsch equation , and map them ( at each time @xmath79 ) via @xmath262 , to @xmath252 .",
    "we employed the integral kernel method from feiszli and mumford @xcite . at the moment ,",
    "our @xmath263_{{\\mathrm{rot}}(s^1)}$ ] will be mapped via this method to the correct curve in @xmath234 up to scaling and translation .",
    "the curve can be readily normalized so that it encloses 0 and has conformal radius 1 ( i.e. so that it lies within @xmath252 ) . of course , the issue is that there is a whole family of possible such normalized curves within an equivalence class in @xmath236 . +   +",
    "this issue can be readily solved by observing the following .",
    "suppose that @xmath264 such that @xmath265 for some @xmath266 , and @xmath267 .",
    "let @xmath268 and @xmath269 be the corrseponding riemann mappings with boundary values @xmath270 and @xmath271 respectively , with @xmath272 and @xmath273 .",
    "then there is a unique element @xmath274 such that @xmath275 .",
    "this explains the differences in normalizations between the @xmath232 and @xmath233 situations and now motivates the technique for our numerical simulation computing @xmath262 .",
    "first , we take our geodesic @xmath11 corresponding to the wunsch equation in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "we employ the algorithm in feiszli and mumford @xcite and solve to obtain the curve we want up to scaling and translation .",
    "we take any normalization ( up to translation and scaling ) of this curve so that it lies in @xmath276 .",
    "we then find @xmath257 and @xmath253 and compute @xmath277 . by previous arguments we have @xmath278_{{\\mathrm{psl}}_2(\\mathbb{r})}$ ] .",
    "hence there exists a @xmath279 such that @xmath280 and we compute @xmath281 .",
    "then we extend @xmath282 to @xmath98 ( simply by observing that we only need to know 3 values of @xmath283 to know @xmath283 itself ) , and then we compute @xmath284 .",
