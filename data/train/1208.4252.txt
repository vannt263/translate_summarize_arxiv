    "after the first observation was reported in 1998 by the cdf collaboration @xcite , which was confirmed until 2008 by cdf and d0 collaboration @xcite at tevatron in excess of 5@xmath4 significance , the study of @xmath5 meson is becoming one of the currently interesting topics , especially since the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiment ran normally . from the point of structure ,",
    "the @xmath5 meson is a ground state of two heavy quarks system , with a @xmath6 quark and a @xmath7 quark , which is very different from the symmetric heavy quarkonium ( @xmath8 ) states , due to the flavor @xmath9 carried by @xmath5 meson .",
    "since the @xmath5 meson carries explicit flavor , it can not annihilate via strong interaction or electromagnetic interaction like the mesons consisting of @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "it can only decay via weak interaction .",
    "thus it provides us an ideal platform to understand the weak interaction of heavy quark flavor @xcite . unlike the heavy - light @xmath12 meson ( q= u , d , s )",
    ", both the @xmath7 and @xmath6 can decay with the other as spectator , or they annihilate into pairs of leptons or light mesons . if more data become available , the @xmath5 physics must be a good place to study the perturbative and nonperturbative qcd dynamics , final state interactions , even the new physics beyond the standard model @xcite . in recent years , many theoretical studies on the production and decays of @xmath5 meson have been done based on operator production expansion @xcite , nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) and perturbative methods @xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite , su(3 ) flavor symmetry @xcite , isgur - scora - grinstein - wise ( isgw ) quark model @xcite , qcd factorization approach @xcite , and the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite .",
    "the @xmath13 meson decays involving a tensor meson have been studied in refs.@xcite . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the authors have studied some analogous @xmath5 decays involving a tensor meson in final states , but only with the tensor meson as the recoiled meson . in this work , we focus on the @xmath14 decays , where @xmath15 denotes a light tensor meson with @xmath16 , which is emitted from vacuum .",
    "we know that factorizable amplitude proportional to matrix element @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 or @xmath20 current , does not contribute because this matrix element vanishes from lorentz covariance considerations @xcite , so these @xmath14 decays are prohibited in naive factorization . to our knowledge , these decays are never considered in the theoretical papers due to this difficulty of factorization . in order to give the predictions to these decay channels ,",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the naive factorization to calculate the nonfactorizable and annihilation diagrams .",
    "what is more , the annihilation amplitudes will be dominant in considered @xmath14 decays because they depend upon the large cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) elements @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "it is worth of mentioning that the pqcd approach is almost the only method can do the quantitative calculations of the annihilation type diagrams @xcite .",
    "the pqcd approach have successfully predicted the pure annihilation type decays @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite , which have been confirmed by experiments later @xcite .",
    "so , for these annihilation dominant decays , the calculation in pqcd approach is reliable .    in this paper , we shall study these @xmath14 decays in the pqcd approach , which is based on the @xmath25 factorization @xcite . in this approach , we keep the transverse momentum of quarks , and as a result , the end - point singularity in collinear factorization can be avoided . on the other hand , the double logarithms will appear in qcd correction due to the additional energy scale introduced by the transverse momentum . using the renormalization group equation ,",
    "the double logarithms can be resumed , which results in the sudakov form factor .",
    "this factor effectively suppresses the end point contribution of the distribution amplitude of mesons in the small transverse momentum region , which makes the calculation in pqcd appraoch reliable and consistent .    in these decays",
    ", there is one more intermediate energy scale , the d meson mass . as a result ,",
    "another expansion series of @xmath26 will appear .",
    "the factorization is only approved at the leading of @xmath26 expansion @xcite , which has also been proved by soft collinear effective theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will take only the leading order contribution in account , unless explicitly mentioned .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present the formalism and wave functions of the considered decays .",
    "then we perform the perturbative calculations for considered decay channels with the pqcd approach in sec.iii .",
    "the numerical results and phenomenological analysis are given in sec.iv .",
    "finally , sec.v contains a short summary .",
    "in order to give the predictions for these considered @xmath14 decays , the key step is to calculate the transition matrix elements : @xmath27 where the weak effective hamiltonian @xmath28 can be written as @xcite @xmath29\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left . -v_{tb}^{*}v_{tx}\\left[\\sum_{i=3}^{10}c_{i}(\\mu)o_{i}(\\mu)\\right]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) the ckm matrix elements .",

    "<S> in this work , we investigate those @xmath0 decays in perturbative qcd approach , based on @xmath1 factorization , where t denotes a light tensor meson . for all decays considered in this work , </S>",
    "<S> there are no contributions from factorizable emission diagrams because the emitted meson is the tensor meson . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the annihilation amplitudes are dominant in these decays due to the large cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa elements , which are only calculable in the pqcd approach . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results show that the predictions for the branching ratios of most decays are in the order of @xmath2 or even bigger , which can be observed in the ongoing experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict large percentage of transverse polarizations in those w annihilation diagram dominant @xmath3 decay channels . </S>"
