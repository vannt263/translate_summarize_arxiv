    "the standard model ( sm ) can successfully describe almost all the phenomena at collider experiments even after the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that there are phenomena which can not be explained in the sm such as the neutrino oscillations , the existence of dark matter ( dm ) and baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "this strongly suggests that the sm should be replaced by a new physics model giving an explanation of these phenomena .",
    "one of the attractive scenarios to explain tiny neutrino masses is obtained in radiative seesaw models , in which the dimension five operator @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the left - handed lepton doublet and the higgs doublet fields , supplying majorana type neutrino masses is generated through quantum levels . thanks to a loop suppression factor , a new physics scale typically described by masses of new particles running in the loop can be of order 1 tev .",
    "therefore , direct searches for this class of models are possible at collider experiments .",
    "furthermore , a dm candidate can be naturally obtained due to an unbroken discrete symmetry which is necessary to enclose a loop diagram generating neutrino masses and to forbid lower order masses such as a tree level dirac neutrino mass .",
    "so far , various models have been constructed in this line .",
    "the model by krauss , nasri and trodden has been proposed in the very early stage  @xcite , in which neutrino masses are generated at the three - loop level , and its phenomenology at @xmath6 colliders has been discussed in refs .",
    "another simple model with one - loop induced neutrino masses has been constructed by ma  @xcite , and its extensions have also been discussed in refs .",
    "the model by aoki , kanemura and seto  @xcite is the three - loop radiative seesaw model , where the strong first order electroweak phase transition and additional cp phases in the higgs sector can be realized , which is required by the successful electroweak baryogenesis scenario  @xcite .",
    "models with radiative generations for dirac type masses for neutrinos have been proposed in refs .",
    "in addition to the above modes , there are a lot of papers proposing various types of radiative seesaw model  @xcite .",
    "apart from neutrino masses , the masses of charged - leptons are also so small compared to the electroweak scale ; i.e. , order of 100 gev , especially the muon and electron masses . in the sm ,",
    "smallness of the charged - lepton masses is just accommodated by taking the yukawa coupling constants to be @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the muon and electron masses , respectively . in refs .",
    "@xcite , several models have been proposed , where charged - lepton masses are radiatively induced . however , tiny neutrino masses are not explained simultaneously in a given model .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to explain the following two questions regarding the lepton masses by extending the radiative seesaw mechanism ; ( 1 ) why they are so small compared to the electroweak scale , and ( 2 ) why there is a large difference between masses of neutrinos and those of the electron or muon . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have proposed a new mechanism where majorana masses of neutrinos and dirac masses of charged - leptons are induced from the different type of dimension five operators ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is a hypercharge is given as @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 being the electromagnetic charge and the third component of the isospin . ]",
    "@xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) isospin triplet scalar field , and @xmath18 is the right - handed charged - lepton singlet fields . it is known that the magnitude of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of triplet scalar fields are severely constrained by the electroweak rho parameter ; i.e. , they have to be smaller than order or 1 gev .",
    "therefore , for the equation ( 1 ) , smallness can be explained by the loop suppression factor if the dimension five operators are generated via loop levels and the tiny vevs of triplet scalar fields as well .",
    "in addition , the question ( 2 ) can be described by the difference in the number of triplet vevs for the generation of masse for neutrinos and that for charged - leptons .",
    "we then have constructed a concrete renormalizable model  @xcite incorporated the above mechanism , in which both the dimension five operators are induced at the one - loop level .",
    "however , we need rather large yukawa coupling constants such as greater than about 3 to reproduce the muon mass . the main reason of this problem comes from the too strong suppression by the triplet vev for the muon mass . therefore ,",
    "in this paper , we replace the one - loop induced operator @xmath10 by @xmath19 with a sm gauge singlet scalar field @xmath20 .",
    "we introduce an additional local @xmath21 symmetry which is spontaneously broken by the singlet vev , so that the singlet vev is expected to be order of 1 tev with an order one @xmath21 gauge coupling constant to get a mass of extra gauge boson to be @xmath22(1 ) tev . under these modifications",
    ", we can reproduce the muon mass with @xmath22(1 ) yukawa coupling constants .    in our model , additional vector - like charged - leptons",
    "play a crucial role in generating the lepton masses .",
    "moreover , the discrepancy in the observed muon anomalous magnetic moment ( muon @xmath1 ) from the prediction in the sm can be compensated by the one - loop contributions of the additional charged - leptons with the mass of order 1 tev .",
    "we discuss the decay property of the additional charged - leptons in the favored parameter regions by taking into account the masses of the muon , neutrinos , muon @xmath1 and dark matter physics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we define our model , and we give the lagrangian relevant to the generation of the lepton masses . in sec .",

    "we discuss the decay property of @xmath32 based on the assumptions given in eq .",
    "( [ assump ] ) and the mass formulae expressed in eq .",
    "( [ z2-mass2 ] ) .",

    ", we consider the benchmark points as listed in table  [ tab : bm ] . among the @xmath34-odd particles ,",
    "the mass of @xmath36 as well as @xmath37 are not so constrained from experiments .",
    "we can then consider the two cases ; ( 1 ) @xmath38 and ( 2 ) @xmath39 . in the case",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath40 can decay into @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 denotes the neutral @xmath34-odd scalar boson ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) . on the other hand , in the case ( 2 )",
    ", @xmath40 can decay into @xmath48 and @xmath49 via the @xmath50 couplings in addition to the decay modes discussed in the case ( 1 ) .",
    "if the case ( 1 ) is realized , the decay of @xmath32 is getting more sensitive to the structure of yukawa interactions related to the generation of the charged - lepton masses , and we concentrate on this case . because of the assumption @xmath51 , the drell - yan pair production cross sections for @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the same , so that the sum of the decay rates of @xmath32 defined by @xmath55 can be measured .",
    "they are calculated as @xmath56\\left(1-\\frac{m_{\\varphi_i}^2}{m^2}\\right)^2 , \\label{edecay_mu}\\\\ \\gamma(e^\\pm \\to \\eta^\\pm\\nu ) & = \\frac{7m}{64\\pi}\\bar{y}_\\eta^2\\left(1-\\frac{m_{\\eta^+}^2}{m^2}\\right)^2 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 for the @xmath58 mode , final states with @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are summed .",
    "we note that the decay branching fraction of @xmath62 can be described by the ratio of the two yukawa couplings @xmath63 instead of @xmath64 and @xmath65 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mell_diag ] ) , the product @xmath66 has to be fixed to obtain the correct muon mass , i.e. , @xmath67 in benchmark  i ( ii ) .",

    "the mass of @xmath72 is taken to be @xmath73 .",
    "the solid and dashed curves are respectively the results in the benchmark  i and benchmark  ii listed in table  [ tab : bm ] .",

    "the decay processes with a neutral @xmath34-odd scalar boson in the final state are summed .",
    "the results in benchmark  i and benchmark  ii are shown as the solid and dashed curves , respectively .",
    "we can see that in the large @xmath78 region , only the @xmath79 mode is increased compared to all the other channels , because only the @xmath80 vertex is enhanced by the large @xmath81 .",
    "we note that @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) can further decay into @xmath82 @xmath83 , and @xmath84 can decay into @xmath85 . therefore , except for the @xmath86 channel , @xmath62 decay into a charged - lepton plus @xmath47 associated with weak gauge bosons .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the phenomenology of two pairs of doubly - charged scalar bosons ; i.e. , @xmath87 and @xmath36 , which is also important in addition to that of @xmath40 in order to identify our model . in our model , the tree level yukawa interaction for @xmath87 is forbidden by the @xmath21 symmetry , so that @xmath87 can not decay into the same sign dilepton unlike the minimal higgs triplet model ( htm )  @xcite .",
    "thus , the main decay mode of @xmath87 is the same sign diboson ; i.e. , @xmath88 as long as @xmath87 are the lightest of all the other component fields in @xmath12 . such a decay mode can appear in the htm with the case of a rather large triplet vev ; i.e. , about larger than 1 mev .",
    "the collider phenomenology for the diboson decay scenario had been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using the lhc data with the collision energy of 7 tev and integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb@xmath89 , the lower mass bound for the doubly - charged scalar bosons has been found to be about 60 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "the following decay modes of @xmath36 via the @xmath90 or @xmath91 couplings are possible if there is a mass difference between @xmath36 and @xmath37 . ]",
    "as long as they are kinematically allowed ; @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "if we consider the case ( 1 ) mentioned in the above , @xmath36 can mainly decay into a charged - lepton plus @xmath40 . in that case , all the decay branching fractions for the modes with the component of the triplet higgs field @xmath12 or @xmath11 are quite suppressed due to the small triplet vev .",
    "we have modified our previous model in ref .",
    "@xcite with the one - loop generation of masses for neutrinos , muon and electron .",
    "the masses of muon and electron are induced by the @xmath96 operator , and those of neutrinos are generated from the @xmath9 operator .",
    "the doublet vev @xmath97 and singlet vev @xmath98 are respectively determined by the fermi constant @xmath99 and the @xmath100 mass which have to be above 1 tev from the constraint from lep  ii experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "the triplet vevs must be smaller than about 1 gev due to the constraint from the electroweak rho parameter .",
    "therefore , the mass hierarchy between neutrinos and charged - leptons can be naturally described by the suppression of the triplet vevs for the neutrino masses with @xmath0(1 ) yukawa coupling constants @xmath64 and @xmath65 .    in our model , the lightest @xmath34-odd neutral scalar boson can be a dm candidate , and @xmath47 corresponds to it when @xmath101 is taken to be a positive value .",
    "the mass of dm is set to be @xmath102 in order to satisfy the relic density and the constraint from the direct detection .    under the assumptions given in eq .",

    "<S> thus , the mass hierarchy between neutrinos and charged - leptons can be naturally described by the difference in the number of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the triplet fields which must be much smaller than the vev of the doublet field due to the constraint from the electroweak rho parameter . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the discrepancy in the measured muon anomalous magnetic moment ( @xmath1 ) from the prediction in the standard model are explained by one - loop contributions from vector - like extra charged - leptons which are necessary to obtain the radiative generation of the lepton masses . </S>",
    "<S> we study the decay property of the extra leptons by taking into account the masses of muon , neutrinos , muon @xmath1 and dark matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the extra leptons can mainly decay into the mono - muon , dark matter with or without @xmath2 bosons in the favored parameter regions . </S>"
