    "a great deal of insight into the history , luminosity and kinematic influence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) can be found by exploring the extended emission line regions found around many of these objects . in these kpc - scale narrow - line regions ( nlrs ) gas",
    "is thought to be photoionized by the powerful emission from the accretion disk very near the central supermassive black hole .",
    "while extended nlrs are ubiquitous in luminous quasars @xcite , there are a subset of lower - luminosity objects with extended regions which have been used to understand agn luminosity history as well as agn ionization geometry @xcite .",
    "these objects are often found in mergers , as galaxy interactions are thought to be a driver of gas towards the centers of galaxies @xcite .",
    "in fact , mergers have been shown to lead to an increase in agn activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) while also leading to an extended ejected gas distribution which can be photoionized by an agn @xcite .",
    "detailed numerical simulations of galaxy mergers , which occur on timescales of billions of years , have found that black hole accretion increases in the first gyr after the two galaxies experienced their first encounter , and subsequently peaks during coalescence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the association of agn activity with galaxy mergers suggests the existence of `` binary '' or `` dual '' agn , in which both black holes are active during the process of merging and coalescence .",
    "such systems have now been observed over a range of black hole separations , although the number of confirmed detections that have been studied in detail remains relatively small ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the interpretation of binary or dual agn is made more complex by the fact that agn activity can vary significantly on timescales of millions of years or less ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an infalling pair of merging galaxies may transition from active and inactive states many times during the lifetime of the merger .",
    "this poses a problem for understanding any potential correlations between agn activity and galaxy mergers in large surveys , increasing the importance of finding mergers where both galaxies are observed to be active for relating agn activity and merger state .",
    "moreover , major mergers are theorized to eventually lead to the creation of powerful obscured quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and studies of the agn properties of galaxies in earlier merger stages offers an opportunity to trace the evolution of these objects .",
    "in addition , agns with extended emission regions can also be used to explore agn feedback , where the effects of powerful agns can drive gas from galaxies and quench star formation and fueling of the central black hole .",
    "powerful , high - velocity winds are observed in many galaxies @xcite , but disentangling the effects of the agn and stellar processes within galaxies can be difficult ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "if agn activity is triggered by mergers , we can use detailed observations of local mergers to measure the ionization properties of excited , extended nlr gas , which can then be used along with gas kinematics to explore the nature of agn feedback in merging galaxies .",
    "the extended nlr is also of particular interest for understanding agn luminosity , one of the fundamental properties of an agn that is used to classify these objects .",
    "there are many indicators of agn luminosity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including the flux of the [ ] @xmath25007 emission line , a strong feature that is seen in agn nlrs @xcite . in galaxies with extended emission line regions , the total flux of [ ] may overestimate the current agn luminosity as measured by other indicators @xcite .",
    "this overestimation is quite important at high redshift , where extended emission is difficult to resolve , especially with current and upcoming near - ir surveys that use [ ] as an agn luminosity indicator . by targeting _",
    "nearby _ agns with observed extended emission line regions with extensive multi - wavelength data , we can explore how common indicators of agn luminosity , such as x - ray and infrared flux , compare to both the nuclear and extended [ ] luminosity as a function of spectral aperture size .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on a local pair of agns , j181611.72 + 423941.6 and j181609.37 + 423923.0 ( ugc 11185 ned02 and ugc 11185 ned01 , and hereafter known as j1816ne and j1816sw ) at @xmath0 ( 175 mpc ) . due to the wide separation between these interacting galaxies ( @xmath1 kpc ) ,",
    "observations of these objects provide a relatively rare glimpse of the concurrent growth of merging supermassive black holes at an early merger stage .",
    "j1816ne was included in a sample of objects with extended kpc - scale [ ] @xmath25007-emitting clouds in @xcite , who used optical spectroscopy for this object to describe the ionization and kinematics for some of the extended gas .",
    "additionally , @xcite used narrow- and medium - band hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) imaging and fabry - perot spectroscopy for the pair to provide evidence that the extended clouds in j1816ne were oriented in ionization cones potentially excited by the central agn .",
    "their data did not allow for a full exploration of the ionization as a function of spatial position across these cones , and the determination of this ionization structure is a central focus of this paper .",
    "in addition , a _ swift / bat _ source at the position of the j1816 system was detected with a hard x - ray flux @xmath3 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 ( log(@xmath6 , * ? ? ? * ) , and both galaxies were a part of a broad study of the merger and clustering properties of _ swift / bat _ sources in @xcite .",
    "j1816sw has not been the focus of any detailed analysis , although both galaxies are listed as seyfert 2 galaxies in the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "as the two galaxies are only separated by @xmath7 , many of the observations of j1816ne include j1816sw , which provides for a wealth of multi - wavelength data , including _",
    "herschel _ far - ir data , which we can use to explore the relationship between the agn and galaxy light to the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for both galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we use long - slit optical spectroscopy obtained with the osmos instrument at mdm observatory of the j1816 merger pair to explore both objects in further detail .",
    "the comparison of these two galaxies is vital if we are to understand how agns evolve as they go through a major merger .",
    "recent results regarding the variation of agn luminosity over short timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that perhaps galaxies in mergers may cycle between active and inactive states as the merger progresses .",
    "the j1816 merger pair offers an ideal test case for exploring this . for the first time , we present an analysis of the ionization properties as a function of spatial position across the face of both galaxies .",
    "we also focus on the kinematics of the extended [ ] -emitting clouds to the southeast and west of the central nucleus in j1816ne to see how the powerful agn has been driving large kpc - scale ionized high - velocity outflows . while both objects host agns , the extended emission line regions seen in j1816ne indicate a much larger intrinsic agn luminosity than would be predicted by the ir emission for this object , in contrast with what is seen from the compact emission of j1816sw .",
    "we further explore the detailed seds , x - ray properties , and nlr size as a function of agn luminosity for both galaxies in this merger pair .",
    "we describe our observations , data reduction and spectra extraction in section [ sec : observations ] , examine the gas ionization structure and kinematics for the system in section [ sec : kinematicsandionization ] , and in section [ sec : broadband ] we describe our modeling of the seds for the objects using a combination of agn and star - forming galaxy templates .",

    "to calculate the systemic redshift of each of the two galaxies as discussed in the next section , we extracted a spectrum from the central 3 , where the center of the galaxy was defined based on the peak of the continuum trace between the emission lines .",

    "uncertainties on the recovered centroid and flux values were found using a monte carlo approach , where we generated 500 artificial spectra by perturbing the flux at each wavelength in the true spectrum by a random amount consistent with the @xmath30 error spectrum .",

    "the emission - line ratios for the gas observed along the slit for j1816ne are in a range characteristic of agns , and the position of the nucleus on the diagram agrees with what was presented in @xcite .",
    "we also confirm that the extended kpc - scale emission observed appears to be ionized primarily by the agn .",
    "while further multi - wavelength observations must be taken to obtain a mass outflow rate , these results demonstrate that extent to which powerful agns can affect gas throughout their hosts .",

    "the position of the nuclear extraction of j1816sw has a higher [ ] @xmath25007/h@xmath25 ratio than the sdss comparison sample , which is expected , as sdss spectra use 3  diameter fibers that allow for both agn and galaxy contribution to the emission line fluxes .",

    "we interpret these velocities as demonstrating that the agn ionization cone observed in the _ hst _ narrow - band imaging is opened towards our line of sight to the west , and opened away from our line of sight to the east .",
    "for the april 19a spectrum , our observations demonstrate that while the gas close to the nucleus is redshifted , along the slit to the southeast the gas slows and moves back towards the systemic velocity , even out to @xmath35 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "the bpt line diagnostics described above suggest that the full extent of this line emission is powered by photoionization from an agn , showing that , in addition to producing an outflowing cone of highly ionized gas , the agn in j1816ne can influence the state of the gas _ between _ the galaxies that is extended along a tidal bridge induced by the merger . in the bottom panel",

    "based on the merger state of the j1816 system , it is possible that as more gas is driven towards the nucleus of j1816ne , the accretion rate onto the black hole and the bolometric luminosity will increase , leading to larger future outflow velocities .    using a similar methodology",

    "the intrinsic luminosity of an agn is a fundamental property that can be used to estimate agn accretion rates , compare multiple populations of agns , and explore the link between agn activity and star - formation in galaxies . in j1816ne and b ,",
    "we are presented with three different , independent methods to infer the agn luminosity .",

    "similarly , the mid - ir emission derived from sed modeling is emitted as reprocessed emission from the distribution of dust surrounding and heated by accretion disk photons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the luminosity in the strong [ ] @xmath25007 emission line is also used as an agn luminosity indicator , and arises from recombinations in the pc- to kpc - scale nlrs photo - ionized by agns .",
    "there are strong relations between these indicators ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although these relations may break down in more luminous agns ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chen et al . in prep ) , highly obscured agns , or in agns with multiple regions of extinction @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", the authors explored the relationship between the physical extent of the nlr and the agn luminosity as traced by both the [ ] @xmath25007 and mid - ir luminosity indicators , demonstrating that the most powerful agns were capable of ionizing gas on scales of up to @xmath93 kpc , corresponding to the full extent of the gas in the host galaxy .",
    "as has been shown in previous sections , j1816ne has an extended kpc - scale , kinematically complex nlr , while on the other hand j1816sw has a very compact nlr .",
    "it is believed that the extended emission observed in j1816ne is due to gas disrupted in the merger being photoionized in the past by the nuclear agn in j1816ne , and @xcite hypothesized that the extended [ ] emission could not be ionized by the relatively weak nuclear agn , indicating that this object was a `` fading '' agn , where it was more luminous in the recent past ( @xmath94 yrs ) . understanding the intrinsic luminosity of an agn is vital for comparing large agn samples , and emission from extended nlrs might lead to an overestimate of the agn luminosity , especially at high - redshift , where they may not be resolved apart from the galaxy nucleus .",
    "thus , j1816ne and j1816sw represent a useful pair to explore how the [ ] luminosity of an agn is dependent on the size of the region used to explore the extended emission , especially with respect to fiber - based spectroscopy such as that employed by sdss .",

    "the kinematic and sed analysis of the j1816 merging system reveals an intriguing pair of very different galaxies . from figures [ fig : sdssimage ] and [ fig :",

    "j1816sw is a lower luminosity obscured agn whose infrared , [ ] , and intrinsic 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosities agree with local samples .",
    "j1816ne , on the other hand , has a large intrinsic x - ray luminosity , which correlates with the [ ] luminosity only when measured across the full extended emission line region .",
    "this result highlights the potential importance of aperture effects in using extended ionized gas emission as a bolometric luminosity indicator , and indicates that , for j1816ne , the luminosity of the extended [ ] emission reflects the current level of nuclear activity .",
    "in addition , for j1816ne , the kinematic size of the nlr , i.e. , the radius at which the velocity of the ionized gas in the extended region drops to the systemic velocity , agrees with what is estimated from the surface brightness of the region .",
    "based on the existence of extended tidal features seen in the optical continuum images seen in figures [ fig : sdssimage ] and [ fig : multiwaveimage ] , and an ionized tidal bridge between the two galaxies ( figure [ fig : twodonedspectra ] ) , it is likely that the j1816 merger pair has undergone one close encounter in the past .",
    "the merger has clearly more strongly affected j1816ne , which has an irregular optical morphology and a large quantity of extended gas , than j1816sw , which still retains a disk morphology . from the timescales derived for simulated mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is likely that we are seeing the j1816 merger after an interaction of over a gyr .",
    "we are currently observing a large quantity of ionized material moving away from the nucleus of j1816ne , as observed in the outflowing gas in the ionization cones .",
    "meanwhile , a more extended and kinematically distinct component of the ionized gas is coincident with extended tidal features in the stellar continuum .",
    "the tidal torques will correspondingly drive gas towards the center of the galaxy and may help fuel star formation and black hole accretion . in the case of j1816ne , we appear to be observing both agn accretion and feedback , and it is possible that j1816ne may eventually be powerful enough to cease the infall of material onto the black hole . as the merger progresses , j1816sw , then , may go through a similar increase in agn luminosity as more gas is fed to the black hole .",
    "while the j1816ne and j1816sw pair has a larger separation , the major merger of the two galaxies may result in a dual agn state in the future ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite explored the hard x - ray and [ ] luminosity for a sample of `` dual agns , '' galaxies observed with two agns separated by less than 10 kpc . for their sample",
    ", they found that the observed hard x - ray luminosities were , on average , half what would be observed for single agns at a given [ ] @xmath25007 luminosity .",
    "the @xcite results then imply a strong evolution in the x - ray luminosity for these objects , or at least an increase in the dust obscuration that may lead to a systematic lowering of the x - ray luminosity from what is observed in figure [ fig : oiii_vs_ir ] .",
    "understanding the evolution of dual agn phases from wide separation after first encounter ( such as in the j1816 system ) to a binary phase and finally coalescence provides interesting insights into the cosmological growth of black holes .",
    "as larger photometric and spectroscopic samples of active galaxies are explored , more objects with extended nlrs will be uncovered .",
    "the upcoming sdss - iv manga survey @xcite will result in ifu observations for 10,000 nearby galaxies , including many agns .",
    "these data will allow for a detailed analysis of the gas ionization and kinematics across the face of these galaxies similar to what we have done with j1816ne and j1816sw .",
    "importantly , while extended nlrs are ubiquitous at quasar luminosities , these future deep observations should probe lower intrinsic agn luminosities and explore the properties of a large sample of extended nlrs as a function of agn luminosity . these objects , which give us an understanding of current and past agn activity , are important for placing agns in the context of galaxy evolution .",

    "<S> we explore the gas ionization and kinematics , as well as the optical  ir spectral energy distributions for ugc 11185 , a nearby pair of merging galaxies hosting obscured active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , also known as sdss j181611.72 + 423941.6 and j181609.37 + 423923.0 ( j1816ne and j1816sw , @xmath0 ) . due to the wide separation between these interacting galaxies ( @xmath1 kpc ) , </S>",
    "<S> observations of these objects provide a rare glimpse of the concurrent growth of supermassive black holes at an early merger stage . </S>",
    "<S> we use bpt line diagnostics to show that the full extent of the narrow line emission in both galaxies is photoionized by an agn and confirm the existence of a 10-kpc - scale ionization cone in j1816ne , while in j1816sw the agn narrow - line region is much more compact ( 12 kpc ) and relatively undisturbed . </S>",
    "<S> our observations also reveal the presence of ionized gas that nearly spans the entire distance between the galaxies which is likely in a merger - induced tidal stream . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we carry out a spectral analysis of the x - ray emission using data from _ xmm - newton_. these galaxies represent a useful pair to explore how the [ ] luminosity of an agn is dependent on the size of the region used to explore the extended emission . </S>",
    "<S> given the growing evidence for agn `` flickering '' over short timescales , we speculate that the appearances and impact of these agns may change multiple times over the course of the galaxy merger , which is especially important given that these objects are likely the progenitors of the types of systems commonly classified as `` dual agns .
