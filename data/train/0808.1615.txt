    "astrophysical black holes ( bhs ) are believed to be common objects in galaxies .",
    "their mass is expected to span many orders of magnitude , from a fraction of the solar mass ( primordial bhs in the galactic halo ) to few solar masses ( stellar bhs in the galactic plane ) up to several billions of solar masses ( supermassive bhs in galactic centers ) .",
    "their angular momentum should be close to the extremal limit due to accretion and mergers @xcite .",
    "for example , if quasars are powered by supermassive bhs , astrophysical observations suggest that they should be rotating near the kerr bound @xcite .",
    "unquestionable observational evidence of the existence of bhs is still lacking @xcite .",
    "current astrophysical data can not rule out `` bh forgeries '' , i.e.hyper-compact objects with redshift and geodesics similar to those of bhs , but lacking an event horizon .",
    "several models of hyper - compact objects with these characteristics have been known in the literature for some time . among these models , gravastars @xcite and boson stars @xcite have been proposed as the most viable alternatives to astrophysical bhs .",
    "the authors recently showed that rapidly spinning gravastars and boson stars may develop a strong ergoregion instability @xcite .",
    "their typical instability timescales are of order of @xmath0 seconds to 1 week for objects with mass @xmath1 . therefore , observed astrophysical hyper - compact objects are likely not to be gravastars nor boson stars .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compute the ergoregion instability for other horizonless , kerr - like hyper - compact objects : wormholes and superspinars .",
    "wormholes can be objects even simpler than bhs @xcite .",
    "they are infinitesimal variations of the schwarzschild space - time which may be indistinguishable from bhs @xcite . in a string theory context",
    ", the fuzzball model replaces bhs by horizonless structures @xcite .",
    "the bh - like geometry emerges in a coarse - grained description which `` averages '' over horizonless geometries and produces an effective horizon at a radius where the individual microstate geometries start to differ .",
    "superspinars are solutions of the gravitational field equations that violate the kerr bound .",
    "these geometries could be created by high energy corrections to einstein gravity such as those present in string - inspired models @xcite .",
    "superspinars are expected to have compactness of the order of extremal rotating kerr bhs and to exist in any mass range .",
    "a rigorous analysis of the ergoregion instability for these models is a non - trivial task ; known wormhole solutions are special non - vacuum solutions of the gravitational field equations .",
    "thus their investigation requires a case - by - case analysis of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "exact solutions of four - dimensional superspinars are not known . to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "the following analysis will focus on a simple model which captures the essential features of most kerr - like horizonless hyper - compact objects .",
    "superspinars and rotating wormholes will be modeled by the exterior kerr metric down to their surface , where dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "this problem is very similar to press and teukolsky s `` bh bomb '' @xcite , i.e. a rotating bh surrounded by a perfectly reflecting mirror with its horizon replaced by a reflecting surface .",
    "these boundary conditions are perfect mirror conditions and require a reflection coefficient @xmath2 . in a more realistic model @xmath3 and a certain transmittance @xmath4 should be taken into account , which will in principle decrease the strength of the ergoregion instability .",
    "we argue that the qualitative behavior of the instability is the same as long as the reflection or the superradiant amplification are large enough .",
    "letting @xmath5 be a superradiant factor , one expects an ergoregion instability to develop whenever @xmath6 . in the perfect mirror limit @xmath7 and the superradiant condition is simply @xmath8 .",
    "the general case can be handled using both the analytical and numerical techniques presented here .    in section [ sec : superspinars ] we introduce the class of objects we will deal with in this work .",
    "they are general approximations to superspinars and wormholes with the basic key features retained . in section [ sec : wh ] we show how to solve for the instability analytically in two different regimes .",
    "the details of these computations are left for appendices [ app : slow rotation ] and [ app : extremal ] .",
    "these approximations are compared with numerical results in section [ sec : num ] , where we also show that another kind of instability sets in for general naked singularities .",
    "this `` algebraic '' instability can be computed algebraically in the kerr geometry .",
    "we close with a brief discussion of our results .",
