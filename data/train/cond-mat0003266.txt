    "<S> the stability of trapped dilute fermi gases against collapse towards large densities is studied . </S>",
    "<S> a hermitian effective contact - interaction for all partial waves is derived , which is particularly suited for a mean - field description of these systems . including the s- and p - wave parts explicit stability conditions and critical particle numbers are given as function of the scattering lengths . </S>",
    "<S> the p - wave contribution determines the stability of a single - component gas and can substantially modify the stability of a two - component gas . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it may give rise to a novel p - wave stabilized high - density phase .    since the first realization of a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath0rb atoms in 1995 @xcite the field of trapped ultracold atomic gases experienced great experimental progress . </S>",
    "<S> this raised the question if a fermi gas can be prepared under similar conditions and whether a transition to a superfluid state can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> an important step towards a possible super - fluid state of trapped fermi gases was the cooling of @xmath1k atoms to a temperature regime where degeneracy dominates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a major problem for the evaporative cooling of fermions is the pauli exclusion principle . </S>",
    "<S> the relative wave - function of two indistinguishable fermions has odd parity and hence they do not feel the s - wave part of the interaction which dominates the force between bosons at low kinetic energies . </S>",
    "<S> this limits the efficiency of evaporative cooling . </S>",
    "<S> several techniques are under discussion to circumvent this problem , e.g. , simultaneous trapping of two fermionic species @xcite , sympathetic cooling of a fermion - boson mixture @xcite , and the use of p - wave resonances to enable efficient cooling via p - wave interactions @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the question how p - wave interactions influence the properties of degenerate fermi gases . </S>",
    "<S> the thomas - fermi approximation together with a new hermitian effective contact - interaction is employed to describe the effects of the atom - atom interaction in a dilute gas including s- and p - wave contributions . </S>",
    "<S> we use this formalism to investigate the influence of p - wave interactions on the stability of trapped one- and two - component fermi gases against collapse towards high densities where the atoms escape from the trap due to three - body collisions and the formation of bound dimers .    in the standard description of trapped atomic gases one uses point interactions in the s - wave channel only . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we present a hermitian effective contact - interaction ( eci ) for all partial waves , which is derived to be an effective mean - field interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> consider two particles of mass @xmath2 which interact via a spherical potential with a range much smaller than their relative wave length . an auxiliary boundary condition at a large radius leads to a discrete energy spectrum @xmath3 , where @xmath4 numbers the positive energy eigenstates and @xmath5 denotes the relative angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> negative energy states , i.e. , bound states , need not be taken into account since the eci is used for the description of systems that are not self - bound . </S>",
    "<S> the energy shift @xmath6 with respect to the eigenvalues @xmath7 of the kinetic energy without interaction can be expressed in terms of the phase shift @xmath8 for the @xmath5-th partial wave @xcite .    for mean - field type calculations we require that the expectation value of the eci calculated with mean - field states , i.e. , free two - body states @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , equals the exact energy shift @xmath10 we choose the following hermitian ansatz for the operator of the eci in a particular @xmath5-channel @xmath11 the arrows above the derivatives indicate to which side they act . using this ansatz in condition </S>",
    "<S> we obtain an explicit expression for the interaction strength @xmath12 @xmath13^{\\!2 }    \\frac{\\eta_l(k)}{k^{2l+1 } }    \\approx \\frac{4\\pi}{m}\\frac{(2l+1)}{(l!)^2}\\ ; a_l^{2l+1 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the scattering length of the @xmath5-th partial wave . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that does not depend explicitly on the auxiliary boundary condition and hence we generalized the result to continuous momenta and energies . </S>",
    "<S> approximation of the phase shifts @xmath8 in terms of the scattering lengths @xmath14 , so that @xmath12 is momentum independent , leads to deviations of at most 5% in the energy shift up to @xmath15 . for the s - wave and p - wave component this reduces to @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the s - wave part is identical to the widely used local contact interaction . </S>",
    "<S> another way to include higher partial wave terms is the pseudo - potential of k. huang and c.n . </S>",
    "<S> yang @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach leads to non - hermitian interactions for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the two - body energy shift induced by this pseudo - potential is by a factor @xmath19 smaller than the exact one , and is therefore not suited for mean - field calculations beyond s - waves .    using the s- and p - wave contributions of the eci we calculate the hartree - fock energy - density functional of interacting fermi gases composed of @xmath20 distinguishable components in an external potential @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we use the thomas - fermi approximation , which is excellent for these systems @xcite . the local energy density of the fermi gas as a function of the local fermi momenta @xmath22^{1/3}$ ] of the different components @xmath23 reads @xmath24   & = \\frac{1}{6\\pi^2}\\sum_{\\xi } u_{\\xi}({{\\vec{x}}})\\ , \\kappa_{\\xi}^3({{\\vec{x } } } )    + \\beta_t\\sum_{\\xi } \\kappa_{\\xi}^5({{\\vec{x } } } )     + \\beta_0\\sum_{\\xi'>\\xi }       \\kappa_{\\xi}^3({{\\vec{x}}})\\,\\kappa_{\\xi'}^3({{\\vec{x } } } )   \\nonumber \\\\   & + \\beta_1\\sum_{\\xi } \\kappa_{\\xi}^8({{\\vec{x } } } )     + \\beta_1\\sum_{\\xi'>\\xi}\\!\\frac{1}{2}\\big [      \\kappa_{\\xi}^3({{\\vec{x}}})\\,\\kappa_{\\xi'}^5({{\\vec{x } } } ) +      \\kappa_{\\xi}^5({{\\vec{x}}})\\,\\kappa_{\\xi'}^3({{\\vec{x } } } ) \\big ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with coefficients @xmath25 the first two terms are caused by the external potential and the kinetic energy , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining ones are the contributions of the s- and p - wave parts of the eci . as a direct consequence of the pauli principle , fermions of one kind interact only via the p - wave part , while fermions belonging to different components feel s- and p - wave interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient of the last term may be modified by effective range corrections of the s - wave channel . since in the following applications @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> is treated as a parameter this effect and others which contribute to the same order in @xmath27 are absorbed in @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> the ground state properties of the system are determined by minimization of the energy with respect to the local fermi momentum under the constraint of a fixed particle number @xmath28 for each component . implementing the constraints by means of chemical potentials </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 the variational problem reduces to an algebraic equation for the local fermi momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> first we consider a single - component fermi gas , where the extremum condition is given by @xmath30 =     \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\kappa^2({{\\vec{x } } } )      + \\frac{8}{15\\pi}\\,a_1 ^ 3\\;\\kappa^5({{\\vec{x } } } ) .\\ ] ] usually the s - wave contribution dominates at low energies , but since s - wave scattering is excluded here only p - wave scattering contributes to the mean - field energy .    from the extremum condition we get the following upper bound for the local fermi momentum of a single - component gas @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> beyond which no energy minimum exists anymore . </S>",
    "<S> condition can also be expressed as an upper bound for the chemical potential @xmath32 \\le \\frac{3(3\\pi)^{3/2}}{40 } .\\ ] ] this limits the particle number @xmath33 of a stable single - component condensate for attractive p - wave interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the stability condition involves the local fermi momentum or density at some point in space , which is not easy to access experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we express the stability condition by a phenomenological parameterization as function of particle number , scattering length and trap size . for simplicity we restrict ourselves to an external potential @xmath21 with the shape of a deformed harmonic oscillator , where @xmath34 is the geometric mean of the oscillator lengths . </S>",
    "<S> the parameterization is fitted to the critical particle numbers obtained from the numerical solution of the extremum condition for a given scattering length using the maximum chemical potential for a stable condensate . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the parameterized stability condition @xmath35{\\!n}\\frac{a_1}{\\ell}\\big ) \\le 1   \\quad\\mathrm{with } \\quad c = -2.246,\\ ] ] for the single - component gas reproduces the numerically calculated stability limit within errors of 1% .    </S>",
    "<S> the critical particle number @xmath36 ^ 6 $ ] of a single - component gas for a typical set of experimental parameters ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) is about @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this is much larger than the particle numbers achieved in present experiments . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this stability limit could be exceeded in near future , e.g. , by increased interaction strength or by the use of tightly confining traps @xcite .    in the following we consider a gas composed of two fermionic species residing in two magnetic substates of hyperfine splitting . </S>",
    "<S> although the s - wave interaction between the species usually dominates , we show that p - wave interactions can not be neglected in general .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy minimization using the energy - density functional for a two - component system leads to two coupled equations for @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42   & = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\kappa_1 ^ 2({{\\vec{x } } } )      + \\frac{2}{3\\pi}\\,a_0\\;\\kappa_2 ^ 3({{\\vec{x } } } ) \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\frac{1}{30\\pi}\\,a_1 ^ 3 \\big [ 16\\,\\kappa_1 ^ 5({{\\vec{x } } } )     + 3\\,\\kappa_2 ^ 5({{\\vec{x } } } )      + 5\\,\\kappa_1 ^ 2({{\\vec{x}}})\\kappa_2 ^ 3({{\\vec{x } } } ) \\big ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second equation is generated by the exchange @xmath43\\leftrightarrow[\\mu_2-u_2({{\\vec{x}}})]$ ] and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> these two equations have a great variety of possible solutions , depending on the signs and the relative strength of @xmath45 and @xmath26 . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we restrict ourselves to equal particle numbers or @xmath46 = [ \\mu_1-u_1({{\\vec{x } } } ) ] = [ \\mu_2-u_2({{\\vec{x}}})]$ ] which leads to equal local fermi momenta @xmath47 and the single extremum condition for both components : @xmath48      = \\frac{1}{2}\\kappa^2({{\\vec{x } } } )      + \\frac{2}{3\\pi}a_0\\,\\kappa^3({{\\vec{x } } } )     + \\frac{4}{5\\pi}a_1 ^ 3\\,\\kappa^5({{\\vec{x } } } ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the generalization to different chemical potentials , different interaction strengths or more components is straightforward .    for the two - component system with s - wave interactions only , the stability condition was studied in @xcite . using which includes the p - wave interaction we obtain the more general condition @xmath49 for each component not to collapse just because of mean - field effects . for @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> this reduces to the stability condition given in @xcite , while for @xmath51 the condition limits the particle number of a metastable two - component fermion condensate even more </S>",
    "<S> . it also shows , that a repulsive s - wave interaction ( @xmath52 ) does not guarantee a stable condensate at larger densities if an attractive p - wave component is present . in this context it is also interesting to study the transition to spatially separated components .    </S>",
    "<S> several very interesting effects appear for interactions with attractive s - wave ( @xmath53 ) and repulsive p - wave components ( @xmath54 ) . here </S>",

    "<S> for an attractive pure s - wave interaction ( lower curve ) the r.h.s . </S>",
    "<S> exhibits an absolute maximum which leads to an upper bound for the chemical potential as discussed for the single - component gas . </S>",
    "<S> if a repulsive p - wave contribution is added , then the r.h.s . of grows at large fermi momenta due to the leading @xmath57 contribution . for values of the s- and </S>",
    "<S> p - wave scattering lengths which satisfy the condition @xmath58 the stability condition is fulfilled for all values of the local fermi momentum , i.e. , the r.h.s . of the extremum condition </S>",

    "<S> thus the repulsive p - wave interaction stabilizes the condensate for any particle number even though the s - wave interaction is attractive .    if the ratio of the scattering lengths is below the limit given by , then the r.h.s . of </S>",
    "<S> the extremum condition exhibits a low and a high density branch , as shown by the middle curve of figure [ fig:2spec_solutionstruc ] . for chemical potentials @xmath59 below the value of the local maximum one obtains the regular low - density solution everywhere in the potential @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> an example is shown in insert ( a ) of figure [ fig:2spec_solutionstruc ] . for larger @xmath59 </S>",
    "<S> novel high - density solutions exist in areas of the trap where @xmath60 $ ] is larger than the value of the local maximum . </S>",
    "<S> as depicted in insert ( b ) the density shows a discontinuous jump from the outer low - density to the central high - density phase . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is stabilized only due to the presence of the repulsive p - wave interaction and occurs when the condition is violated . for values of @xmath59 in between the maximum and the minimum a maxwell construction with equal pressure in the high- and low - density regime may be used to identify the equilibrium density .    . </S>",
    "<S> the three curves correspond to different interaction parameters as labeled . </S>",
    "<S> solutions of on the dotted parts of the curves correspond to maxima of the energy density , while the full branches denote ( local ) minima . the inserts ( a ) and ( b ) show the densities for two values of @xmath59 indicated by the thin lines for a harmonic trap with mean oscillator length @xmath61.,scaledwidth=81.0% ]    however , when @xmath62 drops below @xmath63 the density in the high - density regime grows rapidly so that the three - body recombination rate and thus the trap loss is not small anymore . </S>",

    "<S> nevertheless we expect that for interactions with @xmath68 a metastable high - density phase occurs , where the central densities are by one order of magnitude higher than in the outer low - density region .    like for the single - component gas </S>",

    "<S> the extraordinary large attractive s - wave scattering length of @xmath81 @xcite , i.e. @xmath82 , leads to the rather small critical particle number @xmath83 for each of the two components . </S>",

    "<S> we conclude that for fermi gases p - wave scattering should not be neglected from the outset . </S>",
    "<S> if attractive it constrains the total particle number in the metastable condensate , if repulsive it helps to stabilize multi - component systems with attractive s - wave interactions . in special cases even a novel high - density phase may occur in the center of the trap which should not be confused with bose condensation of cooper pairs . </S>"
