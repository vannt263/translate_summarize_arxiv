    "understanding the glass transition of polymer melts is of enormous interest from the viewpoints of fundamental and applied science .",
    "when polymer melts or other glass - forming liquids are cooled , the structural relaxation slows down tremendously and , eventually , an amorphous solid , a glass , is formed at the glass transition temperature @xmath0 . the structural relaxation , or ,",
    "equivalently , the @xmath1 relaxation of most glass - forming liquids exhibits two striking features : its time dependence differs from a single exponential function and its temperature dependence deviates from an arrhenius law.@xcite    molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations have proven a powerful tool to investigate the initial stages of the glassy slowdown of the structural relaxation in moderately viscous liquids.@xcite most of these studies focused on simple model - glass formers , e.g. , binary lennard - jones mixtures . in md simulations of glass - forming polymer melts , coarse - grained models were used , while investigations on chemically realistic models are more rare.@xcite for the latter models , consideration of all the interactions associated with the connectivity , e.g. , of the energy barriers against the conformational dynamics , interferes with the necessity to follow the slowdown of the molecular dynamics over broad temperature and time ranges due to the limited computer power .",
    "however , the rapid development of computer technology steadily improves the possibilities and , very recently , chemically realistic polymer models have started to become an important tool to study the mechanisms for the primary and johari - goldstein secondary relaxation processes in polymer melts.@xcite    the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) , which focuses on density fluctuations , has been put forward to explain the observation that the temperature dependent structural relaxation times deviate from an arrhenius law for most glass - forming liquids.@xcite in its idealized version , mct predicts a power - law divergence of the @xmath1-relaxation time at a critical temperature @xmath2 .",
    "md simulations were employed to test the predictions of mct for moderately viscous liquids .",
    "it was found that this theory captures many aspects of the glassy slowdown for several simple model - glass formers , including a bead - spring polymer model,@xcite while the applicability to all - atom polymer models was controversially discussed.@xcite in any event , @xmath2 is substantially higher than @xmath0 , indicating that mct fails to describe the molecular dynamics in highly viscous liquids.@xcite therefore , it is important to consider further aspects of glass - forming liquids and approaches focusing on the cooperativity and heterogeneity of the structural relaxation have received considerable attention.@xcite    various experimental observations demonstrated that the nonexponential @xmath1 relaxation of glass - forming liquids is related to the effect that the molecular dynamics are heterogeneous , i.e. , it is possible to select particles that rotate or translate much farther or shorter distances than an average particle.@xcite however , most experimental techniques provide only limited information about the spatial distribution of particles showing different mobilities .",
    "recent nuclear magnetic resonance approaches demonstrated for various glass - forming liquids , including a polymer melt , that the dynamics are spatially heterogeneous.@xcite specifically , particles within a physical region of the liquid show an enhanced or diminished mobility as compared to particles in a region a few nanometers away .",
    "nevertheless , a detailed experimental characterization of the time and temperature dependence of spatially heterogenous dynamics is still lacking .",
    "md simulations provide straightforward access to spatial correlations of the particle mobility.@xcite work on simple models of atomic and polymeric glass - forming liquids reported that highly mobile and highly immobile particles aggregate into clusters , which are transient in nature.@xcite the clusters of highly mobile particles are largest in the very early stages of the @xmath1 relaxation . upon cooling , the cluster size increases and a divergence near the critical temperature @xmath2 was proposed.@xcite moreover , it was demonstrated that string - like motion is an important channel for the structural relaxation of the highly mobile particles.@xcite this means that mobile particles tend to follow each other along one - dimensional paths .",
    "the existence of spatially heterogeneous dynamics is not restricted to simple models , but this effect was also observed for more complex models of glass forming liquids , namely , for models of propylene carbonate , water , and silica.@xcite interestingly , the cooperative string - like motion was found to be of little relevance for the silicon atoms in the silica model , where the structural relaxation follows an arrhenius law.@xcite    it was argued that the structural relaxation differs between bead - spring and all - atom polymer models.@xcite specifically , conformational dynamics are of central importance for the latter , but not for the former models . for all - atom",
    "polymer models , the slowdown of the @xmath1 relaxation was argued to depend not only on intermolecular packing effects , as assumed in mct , but also on intramolecular torsional barriers.@xcite moreover , previous work showed that the conformational relaxation is by no means a simple relaxation process , but it involves , e.g. , pronounced dynamical heterogeneities.@xcite in view of all these results , it becomes apparent that improving our understanding of the polymer glass transition requires a detailed characterization of the interplay of the intra- and intermolecular aspects of the molecular dynamics .    here",

    "<S> performing molecular dynamics simulations for all - atom models , we characterize the conformational and structural relaxations of poly(ethylene oxide ) and poly(propylene oxide ) melts . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of these relaxation processes deviates from an arrhenius law for both polymers . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that mode - coupling theory captures some aspects of the glassy slowdown , but it does not enable a complete explanation of the dynamical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> when the temperature is decreased , spatially heterogeneous and cooperative translational dynamics are found to become more important for the structural relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the transitions between the conformational states cease to obey poisson statistics . in particular , we show that , at sufficiently low temperatures , correlated forward - backward motion is an important aspect of the conformational relaxation , leading to strongly nonexponential distributions for the waiting times of the dihedrals in the various conformational states . </S>"
