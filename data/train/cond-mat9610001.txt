    "in this work we will describe the properties of a still oversimplified submonolayer thin film growth model which includes the four most important physical ingredients of these systems :    \\(1 ) _",
    "deposition_. we will assume that atoms are deposited at randomly - chosen positions of the surface at a flux @xmath0 per unit surface per unit time .",
    "\\(2 ) _ diffusion_. isolated adatoms can move in a random direction by one diameter , or one lattice spacing , which we will take as our unit length .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 the characteristic time between diffusion steps .",
    "\\(3 ) _ evaporation_. isolated adatoms can evaporate off the surface at a constant rate .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the mean lifetime of a free adatom on the surface . as an approximation",
    ", we will assume that the these desorbed atoms do not return to the surface .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath3 the mean diffusion length on the substrate before desorption .",
    "\\(4 ) _ aggregation .",
    "_ if two adatoms come to occupy neighboring sites , they stick to form an island .",
    "we will mainly consider the case of irreversible aggregation , but a more general analysis of reversible aggregation , assuming for simplicity the existence of a critical size @xmath4 below which islands tend to dissociate is given . in any case , islands are assumed to be immobile and do not evaporate .    in the following , we call _ particles _ or _ adatoms _ the isolated atoms ( or monomers ) that are deposited on the surface , and",
    "_ islands _ a set of connected particles ( thus excluding the monomers ) .    some remarks on the assumptions of this simple model regarding its connection to the experiments are now addressed .",
    "\\(a ) _ second layer_ when a particle `` falls '' on top of an island , we assume that the particle deposited on the second layer moves and evaporates essentially as any other particle , except that its diffusion constant and evaporation rate now correspond to the process ocurring on a substrate of the same element as the deposited particles . practically , the mean diffusion length on the _ island _ before desorption , defined as @xmath5 , where the @xmath6 indicate the values on the island , can be different from @xmath7 .",
    "as the simplest scenario , we assume that when the particle reaches the border of the island , it immediately jumps down and increases the area of the island .",
    "we discuss when this effect can be ignored without affecting the scaling results , which leads to applications to situations in which downward transport of monomers from islands is highly improbable",
    ". this could be the case when : ( _ i _ ) there is a barrier @xcite at the edges of the ( first layer ) clusters which prevents single particles from `` falling '' on the substrate and/or ( _ ii _ ) particle diffusion on the second layer is much smaller than diffusion on the substrate .",
    "\\(b ) _ island diffusion_we neglect in this model the possibility for dimers , trimers or larger islands to diffuse on the substrate .",
    "island diffusion has been observed in experiments @xcite and molecular - dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "the effects of island diffusion on the growth of thin films _ without evaporation _ have been addressed in refs .",
    "while these effects are significant since they change the growth exponents , they do not modify fundamentally the growth mechanisms .",
    "we assume that the same is true when evaporation is included .",
    "we study here the _ first _ stages of the growth , roughly until the number of islands on the substrate saturates .",
    "the reason is that it is in this stage that such a simplified model can be of some help to experimentalists who want to understand the microscopic processes present in their experiments .",
    "these fundamental microscopic processes are most easily detected in the first stages of the growth , since in the subsequent stages additional processes can be involved ( additional diffusion paths , interlayer transport , geometrical details of the lattice  ) .",
    "before going into the details of the calculations and their confirmation by computer simulations , we present a simple picture of the growth mechanisms of the submonolayer structures under consideration . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider here the case @xmath8 , i.e. irreversible aggregation and we neglect the particles deposited on top of the islands ( despite the apparent lack of generality of this last hypothesis , the results obtained here are quite general , as we show in section iv ) .",
    "the qualitative evolution of the system is essentially as follows .",
    "the system initiates as a clean empty surface .",
    "monomers are then deposited at a constant rate on the surface and are allowed to diffuse and/or desorb ( evaporate ) .",
    "when two ( or more ) monomers meet , they aggregate irreversibly to form a static island . as more of these encounters",
    "occur , the island density increases with time and islands become larger by capturing adatoms . at some point , islands are so large that they start touching ( coalescing ) , and monomers are rapidly captured .",
    "these two effects lead to a saturation in the number of islands .",
    "interestingly , the saturation is attained when the surface coverage reaches a value close to .15 , independently of the parameter values .",
    "this last point is discussed in detail below .",
    "we now turn to a more detailed discussion of the evolution of the systems in two limiting cases : complete condensation ( evaporation is negligible ) and strong evaporation .",
    "first consider the situation where evaporation is negligible .",
    "this means that atoms deposited on the surface almost never evaporate before aggregating ( after this , they are safe since islands do not evaporate ) .",
    "this situation can be expected to happen when @xmath9 where @xmath3 is the adatom diffusion length on the substrate before desorption and @xmath10 is the typical distance between islands .",
    "fig  [ den]a shows the evolution of the monomer and island densities as a function of deposition time .",
    "we see that the monomer density rapidly grows , leading to a rapid increase of island density by monomer - monomer encounter on the surface .",
    "this goes on until the islands occupy a significant fraction of the surface , roughly 1% .",
    "then , islands capture rapidly the monomers , whose density decreases . as a consequence",
    ", it becomes less probable to create more islands , and we see that their number increases more slowly . when the coverage reaches a value close to 15% , coalescence will start to decrease the number of islands .",
    "the maximum number of islands @xmath11 is thus reached for coverages around 15% . concerning the dependence of @xmath11 as a function of the model parameters , the dda and related models have shown that the maximum number of islands per unit area formed on the surface scales as @xmath12 , or @xmath13 @xcite where @xmath14 stands for complete condensation .",
    "these values are independent of @xmath2 since evaporation is not significant .",
    "when @xmath2 decreases ( i.e. as the evaporation rate increases ) , @xmath7 decreases and eventually becomes smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "in this regime , evaporation is going to significantly alter the growth dynamics , as shown in fig  [ den]b .",
    "the main point is that now the monomer density becomes roughly a _ constant _ , since it is now mainly determined by the balancing of deposition and evaporation .",
    "as expected , the constant concentration equals @xmath16 , as shown by the solid line",
    ". then the number of islands increases linearly with time ( the island creation rate is roughly proportional to the square monomer concentration ) .",
    "we also notice that only a small fraction ( 1/100 ) of the monomers do effectively remain on the substrate , as shown by the low sticking coefficient value at early times ( the sticking coefficient is the ratio of particles on the substrate ( the coverage ) over the the total number of particles sent on the surface ( ft ) ) .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the islands grow by capturing only the monomers that are deposited within their `` capture zone '' ( comprised between two circles of radius @xmath17 and @xmath18 if we neglect @xmath19 , see figure  [ capture ] ) .",
    "the other monomers evaporate before reaching the islands . as in the case of complete condensation ,",
    "when the islands occupy a significant fraction of the surface , they capture rapidly the monomers .",
    "this has two effects : the monomer density starts to decrease , and the sticking coefficient starts to increase .",
    "shortly after , the island density saturates and starts to decrease because of island - island coalescence .    if @xmath2 is further decreased ( precisely @xmath20 i.e. the time a particle remains on the surface is less than the time it needs to move ) , then , clearly , diffusion plays no role ( `` @xmath21 '' ) .",
    "in this situation , islands are formed by _ direct impingement _ of incident atoms as first neighbors of adatoms , and grow by direct impingement of adatoms on the island boundary .",
    "this situation , although apparently uncommon , is not physically impossible and it also allows us to test our predictions over a larger range of parameters .",
    "in this section we present simple scaling arguments that allow to find the dependence of the maximum island density @xmath11 as a function of the deposition parameters ( flux f , diffusion time @xmath1 and evaporation time @xmath2 ) .",
    "these arguments were originally formulated in @xcite for the special case of deposition without evaporation on a high - symmetry terrace . here , the argument is extended to the case of non - negligible evaporation .",
    "we recall that the atomic size is taken as the length unit . for simplicity , we neglect in this section the effects of deposition on the second layer : they will be studied in great detail in the next section .",
    "we will show there that the regime studied in this section corresponds to a large range of physical situations .",
    "the first stage of the argument requires the determination of the nucleation rate per unit surface and time , @xmath22 .",
    "a nucleation event takes place when two adatoms meet .",
    "this happens with a probability per unit time @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the adatom diffusion constant , and @xmath25 the adatom density .",
    "thus , @xmath26    another , independent equation can be written down to relate the nucleation rate and the island density @xmath27 .",
    "it states that in the area @xmath28 occupied by an island , only one ( on average ) nucleation event takes place , _ during the time @xmath29 needed for the growing islands to come into contact_. thus , @xmath30    the time @xmath29 is readily computed by knowing the growth velocity of an island , which in turn requires the knowledge of the adatom density .",
    "we consider in the following the situations of interest for this paper .      the adatom density results in this case from a balance between deposition at a rate @xmath0 and capture by the stable islands at a rate @xmath31 , so that @xmath32    the area of an island of linear size @xmath17 increases by capture of all adatoms falling in an area @xmath33 , so that @xmath34 .",
    "at @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and thus @xmath37 . using ( [ nuc1 ] ) and ( [ nuc2 ] ) one finds @xmath38 . from ( [ n1 ] ) , @xmath39 , or @xcite",
    "@xmath40    the value @xmath41 corresponds to the special case @xmath8 of the general formula @xmath42 for the exponent @xcite .",
    "strong evaporation means the adatoms are more likely to disappear due to desorption , with probability @xmath43 per unit time and site , than to be captured by an island .",
    "therefore , the adatom diffusion length before desorption , @xmath3 , is shorter than the average island - island distance , @xmath44 . in this case , the adatom density results from a balance between deposition and desorption at a rate @xmath45 , so that @xmath46    a growing island is only able to capture the adatoms falling at a distance smaller than the adatom diffusion length before desorption , @xmath7 ( see figure  [ capture ] ) .",
    "if @xmath7 is smaller than the island size @xmath17 , the island will capture the adatoms falling inside an annulus of width @xmath47 around its border , as well as those directly impinging on its edge . since the area of the annulus is @xmath48 if @xmath49 , at time @xmath50 one has @xmath51 . at @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and",
    "thus @xmath52\\approx 1/[fn^{1/2}(1+x_s)]$ ] .",
    "direct impingement is also important for nucleation , so that ( [ nuc1 ] ) becomes @xmath53 where we also used ( [ n2 ] ) .    from ( [ nuc2 ] ) and ( [ nuc3 ] ) , one finds @xmath54 , or @xmath55    for a comparison with previous results , it may be worth it to rederive ( [ scpiev ] ) for any value of @xmath56 .",
    "the nucleation rate reads , for any @xmath56 , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the density of critical nuclei ( clusters of size @xmath56 ) . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we assume that @xmath58 satisfies walton s relation @xmath59 .",
    "inserting into ( [ nuc3 ] ) yields @xmath60 . finally , using ( [ nuc2 ] )",
    "yields @xmath61 , or @xmath62    note that the validity of walton s relation in the presence of strong desorption is highly hypothetical .",
    "it is a point which we reserve for future work . in the rest of the paper",
    ", we only consider the case @xmath8 . in section iv ,",
    "the results for @xmath8 are derived by a more rigorous rate - equations @xcite approach .",
    "we will derive here an approximate analytic expression for the crossover scaling function connecting the complete condensation , diffusion and direct impingement regimes described previously .",
    "in other words , we will compute the maximum island density @xmath11 as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we will then show that , if we measure all lengths in terms of @xmath7 , @xmath63 is a function of its arguments only through a special combination : @xmath64 , where @xmath65^{2/3}$ ] , and @xmath66 satisfies @xmath67    to do this , we assume that the islands are large enough with respect to the atomic size , that we can neglect the curvature of their boundary . then , the adatom density in the region between two islands whose edges are at a distance @xmath10 , obeys the equation @xmath68 with the boundary conditions @xmath69 ( the origin being midway between the islands ) .    in the quasi - stationary approximation , @xmath70 , and equation ( [ bcf ] ) can be solved .",
    "the solution reads @xmath71 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath72    this formula is needed to compute the nucleation rate @xmath23 .",
    "the latter is a mean field quantity , independent of @xmath73 .",
    "letting thus @xmath74 in ( [ sol1])since the highest nucleation probability is at the terrace centre , given the symmetry of our problem ",
    "one finds @xmath75 = 2f\\tau \\frac{\\sinh^2(\\kappa \\ell/4)}{\\cosh(\\kappa \\ell/2)}\\;,\\ ] ] where we used the identity @xmath76 .",
    "the next task is the determination of the total island density @xmath27 .",
    "its time variation is simple : @xmath27 increases each time a new island is nucleated , so that @xmath77 . on the other hand , @xmath27 decreases when two islands touch and coalesce .",
    "following previous authors @xcite , we write @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the average area of an island of linear size @xmath17 .",
    "this means that coalescence results from binary encounters of immobile islands , whose area increases at a rate @xmath80 .",
    "collecting @xmath81 and @xmath82 yields @xmath83    by definition , @xmath11 , which is what we are interested in , satisfies @xmath84 .",
    "this means that the maximum of the island density can be found by balancing the nucleation rate against the coalescence rate , and that the balance is reached when the island size @xmath85 .",
    "one can thus write @xmath86    the growth rate of an island can be computed assuming that its radius is large with respect to the atomic size .",
    "one can then treat the island edges as straight steps , which yields @xmath87    since @xmath88 , one finds @xmath89    note that the two limits @xmath90 and @xmath91 are well reproduced for @xmath92 and for @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "in fact , in the limit @xmath94 , the area increase is @xmath95 , due to direct impingement . in order to interpolate all the way through to this regime , we finally write @xmath96    in the limit where the diffusion length @xmath7 becomes very small , the nucleation probability is also determined by direct impingement of a beam atom on a nucleus , which is described by @xmath97 .",
    "then , the nucleation term in ( [ isl2 ] ) reads @xmath98\\left[f\\tau_e\\frac{\\sinh^2(\\kappa \\ell/4)}{\\cosh(\\kappa\\ell/2)}\\right]\\;.\\ ] ] in fact , a simpler approximate expression will be used , which reproduces the correct limiting behaviour at large and small @xmath7 : @xmath99 ^ 2\\;.\\ ] ]    finally , ( [ da ] ) and ( [ nnn ] ) yield @xmath100^{2}\\approx f(1+x_s)\\ell\\tanh(\\kappa\\ell/2 )   n_{max}^2 \\;,\\ ] ] or , letting @xmath101 , @xmath102^{2 } \\tanh(\\kappa   n_{max}^{-1/2}/2 )   n_{max}^{3/2 } \\;.\\ ] ]    this is the announced crossover scaling formula , in implicit form .",
    "it can be cast in the form : @xmath103^{2 } \\tanh(\\kappa   n_{max}^{-1/2}/2 ) ( x_s^2   n_{max})^{3/2}\\;,\\ ] ] or , @xmath104 where @xmath105^{2 } \\tanh\\left(\\frac{1}{2x}\\right ) x^{3}\\;.\\ ] ] letting @xmath106^{2/3}$ ] , and inverting @xmath107 ,",
    "one finds as promised : @xmath108",
    "in this section we will study the model taking into account the particles deposited on top of the islands with their specific diffusion and evaporation parameters .",
    "we will show that for a large range of parameters , the exponents are the same as those predicted by the preceding analysis .",
    "we use a `` rate - equations '' approach which has been shown to give a good description of the submonolayer regime @xcite . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we include a detailed calculation of the `` cross sections '' for monomer capture .",
    "these `` cross sections '' have also been calculated in @xcite for example .",
    "we will not keep careful track of many of the numerical geometric constants .",
    "the rate equation describing the time evolution of the density @xmath25 of monomers on the surface will be , to lowest relevant orders in f : @xmath109 the first term on the right hand size denotes the flux of monomers onto the island free surface , ( @xmath110 is the island coverage discussed below ) .",
    "the second term represents the effect of evaporation , i.e. monomers evaporate after an average time @xmath2 .",
    "the third term is due to the possibility of losing monomers by effect of direct impingement of a deposited monomers right beside a monomer still on the surface to form an island . as discussed above ,",
    "this `` direct impingement '' term is usually negligible , and indeed will turn out to be very small in this particular equation , but the effect of direct impingement plays a crucial role in the kinetics of the system in the high evaporation regimes .",
    "the last two terms represent the loss of monomers by aggregation with other monomers and with islands respectively .",
    "the factors @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the `` cross sections '' for encounters and will be calculated below .",
    "the number @xmath27 of islands will be given by : @xmath113 where the first term represents the formation of islands due to direct impingement of deposited monomers next to monomers already on the surface , and the second term accounts for the formation of islands by the encounter of monomers diffusing on the surface .",
    "for the island coverage @xmath110 i.e. the area covered by all the islands per unit area , we have : @xmath114                    + \\sigma_i n + jn   \\label{cove}\\ ] ]    the term in brackets represents the increase of coverage due to formation of islands of size 2 ( i.e. formed by two monomers ) either by direct impingement or by monomer - monomer aggregation .",
    "the next term gives the increase of coverage due to the growth of the islands as a result of monomers aggregating onto them by diffusion , and the last term represents the growth of the islands due to direct impingement of deposited monomers onto their boundary , or directly on the island .",
    "the estimation of the value of j is carried out below .",
    "the total surface coverage is given by @xmath115 except at very short times .",
    "the next step in the analysis consists in estimating the cross sections @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "this is done by evaluating the diffusive flux of monomers into a single single solitary island represented by an absorbing disk of radius @xmath17 centered at the origin ( throughout this analysis @xmath17 stands for the typical island radius ) .",
    "the typical radius @xmath17 of the islands will be taken to be : @xmath116    the cross sections are evaluated in the quasistatic approximation , which consists in assuming that @xmath17 does not vary in time and that the system is at a steady state .",
    "thus , we have to solve the equation @xmath117 subject to the boundary condition @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the monomer concentration at position @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the diffusion constant of the monomers .",
    "the solution is given by : @xmath122 where @xmath123 can be identified as the characteristic distance traveled by a monomer before evaporation , and @xmath124 is the modified bessel function of order zero .",
    "we can rewrite eq.[ftaue ] as : @xmath125 where @xmath25 is the monomer density appearing in the rate equations , so that @xmath126 far from the islands .",
    "this , again , is a mean field way of including the effects of the other islands in the flux of monomers into the island in consideration .",
    "the cross section @xmath112 can then be calculated as the total diffusive flux of monomers into the boundary , @xmath127 the cross section for monomer - monomer encounters @xmath111 is obtained from the same formula substituting @xmath17 by the monomer radius , and @xmath121 by @xmath128 as corresponds to relative diffusion .",
    "the rate equations , with the explicit expressions for @xmath112 and @xmath111 are still too complicated to solve exactly .",
    "at best we can focus on extreme cases .",
    "the first step then is to evaluate the extreme values of @xmath112 for the case in which @xmath49 and @xmath129 . using the known asymptotic values of the bessel functions , and once again omitting numerical constants , we have @xmath130 from here on we will neglect the logarithmic variations appearing in the cross section . to evaluate @xmath111",
    "we notice that the monomer radius is a small constant ( it is usually taken as half the unit of length ) , so for all values of @xmath7 , to a good approximation we have @xmath131    formally , the diffusive cross section for monomers should vary in the case @xmath132 , but this is of no consequence since in that regime the contributions from diffusion are negligible .",
    "now we turn to the evaluation of the direct impingement flux @xmath133 . as was the case above",
    ", the exact evaluation of @xmath133 is rather difficult , as it results from the solution of a moving boundary problem .",
    "thus , once again , we must resort to a quasistatic approximation .",
    "the flux @xmath133 will consist of two terms , @xmath134 the contribution due to direct impingement at the exterior boundary of the island , i.e. _ on _ the substrate , and @xmath135 the contribution due to particles falling on the island , diffusing to the boundary , and `` falling '' over the edge to increase the size of the island .",
    "we will continue to assume that the islands are compact , thus , the contribution due to direct impingement at the boundary will be given by @xmath95 ( where we have omitted geometrical constants ) . to evaluate the second contribution we must solve : @xmath136 subject to the boundary condition @xmath118 .",
    "we recall that @xmath137 and @xmath138 represent the values of the diffusion constant and evaporation time of the particles on a substrate of their same species ( clearly , for homoepitaxy @xmath139 and @xmath140 ) .",
    "the boundary condition corresponds to the simplest situation , in which there is no barrier at the edge of the island and every particle reaching the boundary falls .",
    "the increase in coverage will be given by the total flux accross the barrier , i.e. @xmath141 .",
    "in writing this equation we have assumed that no nucleation occurs on top of the island , for this to be the case , we must require that @xmath142 on the island , which will be the case for small enough @xmath0",
    ".    the solution to the above equation can be readily found , and from it we find that @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the typical distance a monomer can diffuse on an island before desorption , and @xmath145 and @xmath146 are modified bessel functions . again using the known properties of bessel functions , we can distinguish two limiting behaviors : @xmath147      we are now in a position to analyse the limiting cases of the system described by the rate equations .",
    "first we consider the new behaviour brought about by the presence of evaporation .",
    "we define the high evaporation regimes as the systems in which all but the first two terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "[ rho ] are negligible .",
    "then , since the coverage is small , we have @xmath148 and @xmath25 reaches a steady state value @xmath149 in a time of order @xmath2 .",
    "thus , as mentioned above , the high evaporation regimes are characterized by having a constant monomer density ( after an initial transient ) throughout most of the evolution of the system . under these circumstances eq .",
    "[ islands ] becomes trivial and predicts that the number of islands at time @xmath50 is given by @xmath150t\\ ] ]    if the evaporation rate is very high , so that @xmath132 , then even the smallest islands at the earliest stages of evolution will satisfy the relation @xmath49 ( will refer to this situation as extreme incomplete condensation ) . if we assume that the diffusion length on the islands @xmath151 is also much less than one , then eq .  [ cove ] becomes @xmath152 where we have neglected the increase of coverage due to the formation of small new islands in eq .",
    "[ cove ] , as most of the coverage is due to the large islands . and",
    "the number of islands evolves as @xmath153 solving for @xmath110 , we obtain @xmath154 now comes a crucial assumption , namely that coalescence occurs when the coverage reaches a fixed constant value , say @xmath155 , and that this value is essentially independent of the details of how the surface is covered .",
    "thus , the time @xmath29 at which coalescence occurs will be @xmath156 since the number of islands is a monotonically increasing function of time up to the time of coalescence , we can estimate the maximum number of islands on the surface as @xmath157    if instead we consider the case in which @xmath158 , and @xmath159 , then island formation will still only occur via direct impingement , but the increase of coverage will be primarily due to monomers landing in the capture zone _ on _ the islands .",
    "in this situation , we will have @xmath160 and again @xmath153 from which we obtain @xmath161 the coalescence time can be estimated as before , leading to a maximum number of islands that scales as @xmath162 if we instead consider the case of extreme mismatch between the materials , so @xmath163 but @xmath164 throughout the evolution of the system , the the capture zone on the islands becomes the whole island , at which point the coverage increases as @xmath165 where we used @xmath166 .",
    "coalescence then occurs at at a time @xmath167 , and the maximum number of islands at that time will be @xmath168    different and more interesting regimes exist for the situation in which @xmath169 , still in the high evaporation regime , i.e. the evolution of the monomer density is still essentially controlled solely by the deposition and evaporation .",
    "this requirement actually limits the value of @xmath7 .",
    "the upper bound for the range of @xmath7 in which this situation prevails is discussed below .",
    "first we consider the case in which eventually @xmath170 as well .",
    "in this situation , the increase in coverage is due mainly to the particles deposited within the capture zone of the islands , which we assume to be relatively large .    for times long enough for these conditions to prevail ,",
    "the evolution of the coverage will be given by @xmath171 and the number of islands will evolve as @xmath172 thus , solving for the coverage , we find that @xmath173 once again we assume that coalescence becomes important at a value of @xmath110 of the order of unity , so that the coalescence time in this regime will be given by @xmath174 and the maximum number of islands will be given by @xmath175    note that ignoring the particles that land on the islands , i.e. taking @xmath176 , as if there was an infinite edge berrier , yields the same scaling as would be expected if @xmath177 , and also the same scaling as would be expected in homoepitaxy , where @xmath178 .",
    "thus , ignoring these `` second layer '' particles is not crucial for the calculation of the exponents , at least for a large range of the values of the parameters .",
    "if we now assume that eventually @xmath179 , but that @xmath164 , then once again the coverage will evolve as @xmath180 coalescence then occurs at at a time @xmath167 , and the maximum number of islands at that time will now be given by @xmath181 this is the result obtained by venables , as we discuss later ( section vi ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is further increased , then the system does not reach the regime characterized in the previous section . as mentioned above",
    ", this regime holds as long as @xmath49 beyond certain point in the evolution of the system .",
    "we can estimate the value of @xmath2 at which this condition never holds , i.e. when @xmath182 , where the maximum island size @xmath183 can be estimated through @xmath184 hence , the evaporation time above which the condition @xmath185 never holds is such that @xmath186 that is , @xmath187 for evaporation times above @xmath188 the monomers are expected to travel distances much longer than the largest typical island sizes . at this point it is important to realize that our criterion for the onset of coalescence , @xmath189 , is equivalent to the requirement @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the typical distance between islands .",
    "thus , for evaporation times much larger than @xmath188 , a great part of the evolution of the system takes place with the monomers traveling distances which are greater than the inter - island distances . during this phase",
    "we expect the effects of evaporation to be negligible . in effect , if @xmath192 , the kinetics of the monomer density is no longer determined solely by the evaporation , but rather , it is eventually determined by the aggregation processes .    at very short times",
    "the number of islands is expected to be very small .",
    "therefore , in the early stages of evolution , they can not affect the monomer density .",
    "thus , the early stages of evolution are expected to be similar to those of the previous regime , for example : @xmath193 this situation is expected to hold until the number of islands is large enough , so that the term @xmath194 is no longer negligible when compared to @xmath0 .",
    "that is , until a time @xmath195 such that @xmath196 from which we obtain @xmath197 as expected , the number of islands at @xmath195 is @xmath198 , indicating that evaporation effects `` turn '' off once the typical inter - island distance is smaller than @xmath7 . for times beyond @xmath195",
    "all evaporation effects become negligible and our rate equations reduce to those given by tang @xcite for a system without evaporation ( plus the direct impingement terms that are negligible in this limit ) for which the results are well known .",
    "namely the time at which coalescence occurs is given by @xmath199 and the maximum number of islands nucleated on the surface is @xmath200    we can now summarize now the various regimes obtained .",
    "there are three principal regimes which are spanned as the evaporation time @xmath2 decreases .",
    "we call them , in this order , the _ complete condensation _",
    "regime where evaporation is not important , the _ diffusion _ regime where islands grow mainly by diffusive capture of monomers and finally the _ direct impingement _ regime where evaporation is so important that islands can grow only by capturing monomers directly from the vapor . within each of these regimes , there are several subregimes characterized by the value of @xmath19 , the desorption length on top of the islands .",
    "we use @xmath201 , the typical island - island distance when there is no evaporation and @xmath183 as the maximum island radius , reached at the onset of coalescence .    _",
    "complete  condensation _",
    "@xmath202    @xmath203    _ diffusive growth _",
    "@xmath204    @xmath205    with @xmath206 , which gives for the crossover between regimes ( a ) and ( b ) : @xmath207 .    _ direct  impingement  growth _",
    "@xmath132    @xmath208    with @xmath209 , which gives for the crossover between regimes ( a ) and ( b ) : @xmath210 .",
    "we note that these equations agree with the scaling analysis presented above ( equations  [ scpinev ] and [ scpiev ] ) in the appropriate subregimes ( @xmath211 ) .",
    "in the following paragraphs , we test the assumptions and predictions of the analysis given in the preceding sections in the special case @xmath8 and no contribution from atoms deposited on top of the islands . as we stressed above , the exponents observed without contribution from the second layer are the same as those observed for a large range of parameters .",
    "we also show results that are not attainable from this mean - field calculations , namely the island size distributions .",
    "our computer simulations generate sub - monolayer structures using the four processes included in our model ( see the introduction ) . here",
    "we take @xmath212 as the time scale of our problem . the monomer diffusion coefficient is then given by @xmath213 .",
    "we use triangular lattices ( six directions for diffusion ) of sizes up to @xmath214 with periodic boundary conditions to avoid finite size effects . for simplicity , in these simulations",
    ", the atoms deposited on top of existing islands are not allowed to `` fall '' on the substrate .",
    "we have checked that allowing the atoms to fall down the substrate does not change significantly the results .",
    "the program actually consists of a repeated loop . at each loop , we calculate two quantities @xmath215 and @xmath216 that give the respective probabilities of the three different processes which could happen : depositing a particle ( deposition ) , moving a particle ( diffusion ) or removing a particle from the surface ( evaporation ) . more precisely , at each loop we throw a random number p ( @xmath217 ) and compare it to @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "if @xmath220 , we deposit a particle ; if @xmath221 , we remove a monomer , otherwise we just move a randomly chosen monomer .",
    "after each of these possibilities , we check whether an aggregation has taken place and go to the next loop ( for more details , see @xcite ) .      a major assumption made in the theoretical treatment",
    "is that the maximum of the island density is reached when the _ coverage _ attains a constant value .",
    "we note that this assumption is equivalent to the one used in the scaling analysis , since , for compact islands , @xmath222 .",
    "it is essential then to check this assumption first .",
    "figs  [ covmax]a - c show that this it is justified , since @xmath223 , the coverage at which the maximum island density is reached , does not vary systematically with f , @xmath2 or @xmath224 .",
    "@xmath224 is defined as @xmath225 and indicates the importance of evaporation : @xmath226 means that evaporation is significant , while @xmath227 indicates that we are in the regime of complete condensation ( see eq .",
    "[ eqsca ] ) .    in the non - evaporation case",
    ", it has also been recognized that @xmath223 is independent on the flux or diffusion rate @xcite .",
    "actually , villain and co - workers @xcite use this criterion to find the flux and diffusion dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "we think that the combination of two effects can lead to a constant @xmath223 .",
    "first , at coverages close to .15 , islands occupy enough surface to capture rapidly the landing monomers , which prevents nucleation of new islands .",
    "second , at this coverage , islands begin to touch and coalesce ( @xmath228 ) , thus starting the decrease in island density .",
    "we note that @xmath223 is _ not _ constant when large islands are allowed to move , even in the non - evaporation case @xcite .",
    "having confirmed our main assumption , we now turn on to the evolution of the maximum island density @xmath11 as a function of the different parameters @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( remember that we take @xmath212 as the time scale of our problem ) .      before looking in detail into the different regimes predicted by equations  [ eqcc ] , [ eqdif ] and [ eqdir ] ,",
    "we summarize our simulation results in fig .",
    "[ crossover ] .",
    "we show there _ all _ our data ( more than 200 points ) for @xmath11 as a function of the parameters .",
    "our scaling analysis predicts that the data should fall into a single curve , given by equation  [ eqsca ] .",
    "we see that the data remarkably confirms our analysis , over more than 20 orders of magnitude .",
    "this gives us confidence on our entire approach and its predicted exponents , which we now turn on to check in more detail .",
    "the object of this section is to check that the results summarized in equations  [ eqcc ] , [ eqdif ] and [ eqdir ] are correct .",
    "figure  [ nmaxfnoscal ] shows the evolution of the maximum island density as a function of the flux for different evaporation times .",
    "each of these curves is different from the others , since they correspond to different evaporation times .",
    "however , according to our preceding analysis , they should all present a transition from the low evaporation regime to the high evaporation regime .",
    "this can be detected by a change of slope , from @xmath229 in the high evaporation regime to @xmath230 in the low one ( eq . [ eqdif]a and [ eqcc ] ) .",
    "of course , this regime change does not occur for all the curves at the same value of the flux , since the parameter that determines that change is not the flux but rather @xmath231 .",
    "figure  [ nmaxfnoscal ] shows our predictions are correct , at least concerning the flux evolution of the maximum island density .",
    "we now turn to the other variable , the evaporation time .",
    "we show in figure  [ nmaxtenoscal ] the dependence of the maximum island density on @xmath2 .",
    "we notice that for high enough evaporation times , the island density tends to become roughly constant , as predicted by our calculations . for lower values of @xmath2",
    ", @xmath11 changes rapidly .",
    "our analysis predicts two regimes : for @xmath232 , we expect @xmath233 , ( eq .  [ eqdif]a ) while for @xmath234 , we expect @xmath235 ( eq .  [ eqdir]a ) .",
    "this last regime is clearly seen for the curve obtained for a flux @xmath236 ( squares , solid line ) .",
    "the intermediate regime is difficult to see because of the crossovers with the two other regimes .",
    "however , taking a very low value for the flux ( @xmath237 , filled triangles ) , we can see that the slope in this intermediate regime is close to 1 ( dashed line ) .",
    "we have also checked the exponents obtained when @xmath132 , in the direct impingement regime .",
    "[ eqdir]a predicts that the maximum island density scales with the product @xmath16 with an exponent 2/3 .",
    "this is confirmed by our computer simulations ( figure [ fte23 ] ) , over more than 6 orders of magnitude .      a last test for the analysis is presented in fig  [ stick ] .",
    "we show that the dependence of the sticking coefficient s at the saturation island density ( @xmath238 ) follows eqs .",
    "[ ftc1 ] , [ ftcdir ] and  [ ftc2 ] . by constructing an evaporation parameter @xmath239",
    ", we can group all the regimes in a single curve : for the complete condensation regime , @xmath240 , for the others @xmath241 .",
    "island size distributions have proven very useful as a tool for experimentalists to distinguish between different growth mechanisms @xcite . by _",
    "size _ of an island , we mean its total number of monomers or mass .",
    "unfortunately this information is beyond the reach of the simple mean field rate equation analysis presented above @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the distributions can be obtained from the simulations .",
    "fig  [ distrib ] shows the evolution of the _ rescaled _",
    "@xcite island size distributions as a function of the evaporation parameter @xmath242 .",
    "it is clear that the distributions are significantly affected by the evaporation , smaller islands becoming more numerous when evaporation increases .",
    "this trend can be qualitatively understood by noting that new islands are created continuously when evaporation is present , while nucleation rapidly becomes negligible in the complete condensation regime .",
    "the reason is that islands are created ( spatially ) homogeneously in the last case , because the positions of the islands are correlated ( through monomer diffusion ) , leaving virtually no room for further nucleation once a small portion of the surface is covered ( @xmath243 ) . in the limit of strong evaporation",
    ", islands are nucleated randomly on the surface , the fluctuations leaving large regions of the surface uncovered .",
    "these large regions can host new islands even for relatively large coverages , which explains that there is a large proportion of small ( @xmath244 ) islands in this regime .",
    "other authors have analyzed similar mean - field rate equations to find the growth dynamics and maximum island density in the presence of evaporation @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we discuss the relationship between our work and the preceding studies .",
    "in fact , a distinction must be made between the result of stoyanov and kaschiev , and that of venables et al .",
    "stoyanov and kaschiev consider that atoms may diffuse on top of an island , with the same diffusion length as on the substrate ( @xmath245 in our notations ) .",
    "this corresponds to the regimes described by equations  [ eqcc ] and  [ eqdif]a ( they do not consider the direct impingement regime ) . however , their result in the regime where evaporation is important is @xmath246 , different from our predictions ( see both eq .  [ eqdif]a and eq .",
    "[ eqdir]b ) , which are clearly supported by our simulations ( see for example fig .  [ nmaxfnoscal ] ) .",
    "as shown in the following , we think that the difference with our result stems from overlooking the fact that only the adatoms falling at a distance @xmath247 from the island edge contribute to the rate of growth of the island : in other terms , their capture cross section is not appropriate .",
    "stoyanov and kaschiev assume , as we do , that the diffusing adatoms have two possible fates : either to evaporate or to be captured by an island .",
    "their lifetime @xmath248 is thus @xmath249 and the adatom density reads @xmath250 this is eq .",
    "( 6.2 ) of @xcite .    at this point",
    ", the incorrect assumption is made that the rate of growth of the area of an island of radius @xmath17 reads @xmath251 throughout the strong evaporation regime ( cf .",
    "writing then @xmath252 one finds @xmath253 , or @xmath254 this is eq .",
    "( 6.12 ) of @xcite , and it leads to @xmath255 in the `` incomplete condensation '' , @xmath256 .",
    "on the other hand , venables et al . actually study ( though it may not be easily guessed by reading their papers : we would like here to acknowledge an anonymous referee for precious help ) the regime where _ all _ the particles deposited on top of the islands _ immediately _ fall on its border , thus contributing to increase its radius .",
    "this corresponds to the subregime described by eq .",
    ". our prediction agrees with their result in the `` extreme incomplete '' regime ( see table 1 of ref .",
    "this regime applies only if diffusion and/or desorption are different on the substrate and on top of islands , which can not be the case in homoepitaxial situations . in heteroepitaxial growth , on the other hand , the substrate and the islands of the first monolayer are chemically different , and venables et al.s assumption may apply ; however , it is a special situation , not the general rule .",
    "the origin of their `` initially incomplete '' regime is more mysterious .",
    "we try in the following to understand its origin .",
    "we now show that the assumption of venables et al.s concerning the atoms falling on top of an island , leads to their equation for the maximum island density , eq .",
    "( 2.17 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . in our notations",
    "the latter reads @xmath257 where @xmath258 is the deposited dose ( coverage ) and @xmath259 its value at coalescence .",
    "assume that an island grows by capturing all atoms falling on top of it , plus those diffusing to it .",
    "then , the rate of growth of the island area is @xmath260 where @xmath258 is the deposited dose , or coverage .    from eq .",
    "( [ ada ] ) and the nucleation rate , one finds @xmath261    letting ( [ this ] ) equal to @xmath262 ( cf .",
    ". [ scall ] ) , one has @xmath263 where @xmath264 is the coverage at coalescence . rewriting yields @xmath265n\\approx ( \\theta_0+x_s^2n)n \\;,\\ ] ] which gives immediately eq .",
    "( [ venn ] ) .",
    "we now turn on the relation of our crossover scaling ( section iii - c ) to recent work by bales @xcite .",
    "recently , the crossover scaling of the island density between different growth regimes _ on vicinal surfaces _ ( without evaporation ) was addressed by bales @xcite , and by pimpinelli and peyla @xcite . in particular , bales claims that `` when atoms desorb from the surface a crossover scaling form identical to '' his results `` is satisfied with '' the distance between surface steps `` replaced by the average distance @xmath247 a monomer will travel before desorbing '' @xcite .",
    "we argue that bales claim is not true , as it stands . to see this",
    ", we need consider what happens on a vicinal substrate . we do this using the argument of sect .",
    "of course , competition between two length scales occurs in this case , too , the two lengths being the adatom diffusion length before capture by an island , @xmath44 , and the step - step distance @xmath10 .",
    "when @xmath266 , the diffusing adatoms behave as though they were on a flat substrate , and the island density is still given by equation ( 4 ) . in the opposite case , @xmath267 ,",
    "the adatom density is fixed by capture at steps , so that @xmath25 can be found by replacing @xmath247 by @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , in agreement with bales statement : @xmath268    however , since evaporation is now neglected , an island grows by capturing all adatoms diffusing to its border .",
    "this means the island average radius grows as @xmath269 and since @xmath270 at @xmath35 , one has @xmath271    in the regime of dominant adatom capture by steps the island density at saturation is found from @xmath272 and thus @xmath273    a crossover between equation ( 4 ) and ( [ pippi ] ) is thus expected : it has been actually found by pimpinelli and peyla @xcite .",
    "bales @xcite considered the crossover scaling of the island density at low coverage .",
    "his result for the regime of dominant adatom capture by steps , eq .",
    "( 9 ) of his paper , is found ( within logs ) by letting @xmath274 and @xmath8 in ( [ balle2 ] ) above , @xmath275    note that this can not be obtained by replacing @xmath247 by @xmath10 in our result , eq .",
    "( 7 ) above .",
    "it is however obtained by replacing @xmath247 by @xmath10 in venables result .",
    "this is because venables does not take into account the crucial phenomenon which occurs during evaporation  namely , that only the adatoms falling near or at the step edge can contribute to the island growth .",
    "to neglect this is correct within venables assumptions , as well as on a vicinal surface without evaporation , where the latter mechanism is replaced by adatom capture by steps .",
    "our crossover scaling does not therefore coincide with bales , and bales results @xcite however modified do not describe homoepitaxial growth with desorption ( @xmath245 ) .",
    "by combining different mean - field analysis and extensive computer simulations , we have shown that the presence of evaporation has important effects on the growth of submonolayer films .",
    "we have investigated the different regimes that arise when the growth parameters are varied , and predicted the behaviour of several experimentally accessible quantities such as the island size distributions , the maximum island density and the time at which this maximum is reached . in some cases",
    ", by measuring these last two quantities we can infer the values of both the evaporation and the diffusion times , which are difficult to obtain otherwise .",
    "for example , if the experiments are carried in the intermediate regime ( and this can be checked from the sticking coefficient ) , by using equations   [ eqdif]a and  [ ftc1 ] , we obtain @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "future directions of study should include more realistic hypotheses for a direct comparison with experiments @xcite .",
    "in particular , we are presently extending our analysis to the case of three - dimensional growth ( i.e. leading to cap - shaped islands ) and the influence of defects on the surface which could act as nucleation centers .",

    "<S> we present a model for thin film growth by particle deposition that takes into account the possible evaporation of the particles deposited on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> our model focuses on the formation of two - dimensional structures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the presence of evaporation can dramatically affect the growth kinetics of the film , and can give rise to regimes characterized by different `` growth '' exponents and island size distributions . </S>",
    "<S> our results are obtained by extensive computer simulations as well as through a simple scaling approach and the analysis of rate equations describing the system . </S>",
    "<S> we carefully discuss the relationship of our model with previous studies of the same physical situation , and we show that our analysis is more general .    the growth of nanostructures and thin films prepared by atomic deposition is recognized to be both a standard and a promising way to prepare new materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several models @xcite have led to a good understanding of the growth properties in the simplest cases , when only a limited number of physical ingredients are included in the simulations : deposition , diffusion and aggregation as in the dda model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a drawback of this conceptual simplicity is that the range of experimental situations accurately described by these models is limited . </S>",
    "<S> it is actually limited to ( beautifully ) artificial experimental setups where great care is taken to avoid complications ( contamination , surface defects , etc . </S>",
    "<S> see for example @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , many ( technologically ) interesting experimental situations are much more complex . </S>",
    "<S> progress towards their understanding demands the inclusion of processes that have been left out of the first models . </S>",
    "<S> for example , including reversible aggregation @xcite allows to understand the saturation of island density before island - island coalescence and produces compact islands . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show the effects of including _ evaporation _ of the atoms from the surface .    </S>",
    "<S> evaporation , i.e. the possibility of desorption of adatoms from the surface , is a feature that should be observed for any system at high enough temperatures . in this sense , it is a phenomenon that is as general as the rest of the ingredients of recent models of film growth , and is capable of completely changing the quantitative behaviour of the system ( scaling dependence of island density on the deposition parameters , island size distributions  ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the effects of evaporation have already been studied experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thin film growth models which include evaporation have already been studied using a mathematical analysis of rate equations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> computer simulations of such models , aiming a quantitative analysis of scaling relations or island size distributions have , to our knowledge , never been carried out . </S>",
    "<S> the point is that computer simulations represent an `` exact '' way of reproducing the growth , in the sense that they avoid the mean - field approximations of mathematical rate - equations approaches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a careful consideration of the downward transport of monomers from islands leads to results that significantly differ from previous studies @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> evaporation is of course not the only process that needs to be added in order to better describe most of the film growth experiments . </S>",
    "<S> other candidates include interlayer transport , particle dissociation ( if the incident particles are molecules or clusters rather than atoms ) or intricate chemical interactions between adatoms and the surface ( for a taste of the real growth world , see for example refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . these effects are less pervasive than evaporation , but nevertheless , should eventually be considered , keyed to specific experimental systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> section i briefly presents the model and discusses some of its approximations . </S>",
    "<S> then , in section ii , we give a rapid overview of the growth of the films when evaporation is taken into account , and try to give a _ physical intuition _ for what is going on . </S>",
    "<S> after this , section iii presents a simple _ scaling _ approach which gives the behaviour of the saturation island density as a function of the parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling approach is completed in section iv by a more rigorous approach based on a careful analysis of the _ rate equations _ of the system . </S>",
    "<S> section v confirms the preceding results by extensive _ computer simulations _ of the model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in section vi , we discuss our results and the differences with the previous approaches @xcite . </S>"
