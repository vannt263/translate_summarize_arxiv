    "photometric observations of asteroids , through the lightcurves collection , allow us to determine their rotational parameters ( synodic rotational period , spin axis orientation , sense of rotation , etc . ) and physical properties ( shape , colour indexes , surface dishomogeneity , taxonomic class , etc . ) .",
    "the knowledge of the rotational characteristics is important to understand the collisional evolution of single minor planets , of families and of the whole asteroidal population .",
    "it is also essential to check the action of the so - called yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievski - poddak ( yorp ) effect on smaller asteroids .",
    "it seems to become clear that the spin characteristics of super - fast and slow rotators are the result of the torque from solar radiation and re - radiation @xcite with the collisional processes determining the excitation of the tumbling motion on slow rotators .",
    "the results reported in this paper are part of the large photometric observational programme of asteroids undertaken since 1979 at the physics and astronomy department of catania university @xcite .",
    "the aim of this long - term programme is to increase the number of asteroids with well - known rotational parameters and consequently improve the database necessary for the investigation of the minor planet evolutionary history .",
    "special attention has been devoted to the asteroids with observational constraints and to those with few known lightcurves , in order to obtain the minimum number needed to apply pole coordinates and shape computational methods @xcite . since the study of near - earth objects ( neos ) is important to improve the knowledge of inner solar system mechanics and physics ( resonance mechanisms , smaller bodies dynamics , connection with meteorites , etc . ) , we have recently expanded our programme to include these objects .    in this paper",
    "we present new photometric observations of six main - belt asteroids , 27  _ euterpe _ , 173  _ ino _ , 182  _ elsa _ , 539  _ pamina _ , 849  _ ara _ , and 984  _ gretia _ , one hungaria object , 1727  _ mette _ , and two neos , 3199  _ nefertiti _ and _ 2004  ue_.    the values of the synodic rotational period , lightcurve amplitudes , and @xmath3 colour index of almost all the observed asteroids are presented . for 182  _ elsa _ and 1727  _ mette _ the rotational periods we derived represent a significant improvement on the previously published values . for 182",
    "_ elsa _ also the _ h - g _ magnitude relation @xcite was obtained .",
    "the first observed lightcurve of the small neo _ 2004",
    "ue _ might indicate an elongated shape and possible smooth surface .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we describe our observations and data reduction in section  [ sec : photobs - datared ] ; the results and comments on each single object are reported in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the photometric observations reported in this paper were carried out at two different observatories using different telescopes and instruments .",
    "ccd imaging photometry was obtained during three observing runs at the asiago station of padova astronomical observatory ( hereafter pd station ) , by using the 67/92-cm schmidt telescope .",
    "unfiltered ccd photometry was performed with the scam-1 camera in january and february 2003 with mostly clear and stable weather conditions ( mean seeing @xmath4 ) .",
    "the scam-1 camera hosts a front illuminated @xmath5 loral ccd with a @xmath6 pixel - size . taking into account the telescope plate scale ( @xmath7/mm ) , the resulting projected sky area was about @xmath8 with an angular resolution of about @xmath9/pixel .",
    "further ccd photometric observations were carried out using the same telescope equipped with the itanet camera @xcite , hosting a front illuminated @xmath5 kodak - kaf 4200 ccd , with @xmath10 pixel - size .",
    "the observations were performed through @xmath11 and @xmath12 johnson filters in april 2003 and november 2004 , under photometric weather conditions with seeing varying between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "taking into account the telescope plate scale and the detector pixel - size , the resulting field of view turned out to be @xmath15 with an angular resolution of @xmath16/pixel .",
    "the exposure time during both campaigns varied from 2 to 5 minutes , depending on the asteroid magnitude .",
    "ccd image pre - reduction , including bias , dark , and flat - field correction , was made with standard iraf routines .",
    "nightly twilight flat - fields were used to correct images for optical vignetting , dust shadow , and pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variation . in order to maximize the asteroid signal - to - noise ratio ( especially in cases of elongated images of fast moving asteroids ) , elliptical aperture photometry was performed using the sextractor software @xcite .",
    "a set of comparison stars , each having magnitudes similar to that of the observed asteroid , was selected along the object nightly path . from this set of stars ,",
    "the non - variable star with the highest signal - to noise ratio was chosen as the nightly comparison star . due to a filter wheel technical problem no fields of standard star",
    "were observed during both runs .",
    "therefore only differential photometry was obtained from ccd imaging data .",
    "photoelectric photometry was carried out in november 1993 , december 1996 , and july , september , october and november 2004 at the 91-cm cassegrain telescope of m.g .",
    "fracastoro station of inaf - catania astrophysical observatory ( hereafter ct station ) .",
    "the observations were performed with the johnson @xmath17 and @xmath11 standard filters .",
    "a 1.5-mm diameter diaphragm , limiting the telescope field to about @xmath18 , and a cooled photon - counting single - head photometer equipped with an emi9893qa/350 photomultiplier were used .",
    "nearby solar spectral type comparison stars were selected along the asteroid path to neglect the second - order chromatic effects of atmospheric extinction .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath11 linear extinction coefficients were derived each night through the comparison stars . in order to determine the transformation coefficients to the johnson standard system ,",
    "several standard stars , selected from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , were also observed during each night . the observing strategy and data reduction",
    "were the same as those already adopted during previous observational campaigns of asteroids @xcite .    both for ccd and photoelectric data ,",
    "the final error of the single measurements is on average between @xmath19 and @xmath20  mag . on the basis of the asteroid aspect data ,",
    "the time corresponding to each data point was corrected for light - travel time and , when determined , the standard @xmath11 magnitudes were also reduced to the unit geocentric and heliocentric distances ( @xmath21 ) . the value of the synodic rotational period , the composite lightcurve , the mean reduced magnitude @xmath22 , and the nightly magnitude shifts were obtained by applying the fourier analysis , as described in @xcite .",
    "the nightly aspect data for each asteroid observed at pd and ct station are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the first column reports the mean universal time ( ut ) of the nightly observational interval , rounded to a hundredth of a day .",
    "the other columns give the heliocentric ecliptic longitude and latitude , asteroid - sun ( @xmath23 ) and asteroid - earth ( @xmath24 ) distances , and solar phase angle ( @xmath25 ) at the mean - time of each observing night .",
    "for the asteroids observed at ct station , the value of the mean reduced magnitude @xmath22 are also reported .",

    "figure  [ fig : gretia - lc ] reports the relative magnitude lightcurve , phase folded with the @xmath94 synodic rotational period value , in good agreement with the one reported by @xcite and @xcite . the lightcurve behaviour is regular with four symmetric extrema at different level and an amplitude of @xmath95  mag .",
    "the asteroid 1727  _ mette _ is a relatively small object ( @xmath96  km ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , belonging to the hungaria zone , as defined by @xcite .",
    "previous ccd photometric observations were reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who derived unreliable synodic rotational periods of @xmath97 and @xmath98 , on the basis of poor - sampled and incomplete lightcurves .",
    "we observed 1727  _ mette _ using the ccd scam-1 camera at pd station .",
    "the observations were performed in white - light during three nights in january and february 2003 .",
    "the composite lightcurve ( figure  [ fig : mette - lc - scam1 ] ) shows an amplitude of @xmath90  mag and an almost symmetric trend with four well - defined extrema at different depth and height .",
    "we derived a synodic rotational period of @xmath1 , improving the previous determinations .    in order to confirm our result ,",
    "further @xmath11 and @xmath12 photometric observations were carried out during five nights in april 2003 , at the same observing site using the ccd itanet camera . we derived a synodic rotational period of @xmath99 , in perfect agreement with our previous value .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 lightcurve are plotted in figure  [ fig : mette - lc - itanet ] .",
    "they both show a trend similar to that of figure  [ fig : mette - lc - scam1 ] as well as four well - defined extrema at slightly different levels .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 lightcurve amplitudes are @xmath100 and @xmath101  mag , respectively . despite",
    "the lightcurve amplitude usually increases with increasing phase angle , the latter values are slightly lower than our previous determination .",
    "this might be due to a variation of the aspect angle between the two observing runs .",
    "in fact the viewing / illumination geometry can also play a role in changing the amplitude of the lightcurve .",
    "the first photometric observations of this s - amor nea were performed by @xcite who obtained a synodic rotational period of @xmath102 and an amplitude of @xmath57  mag . during the 1986 apparition",
    "@xcite derived a shorter value of @xmath103 .",
    "@xcite using photometric data from the 1982 , 1984 , 1994 , and 1995 apparitions , obtained a synodic rotational period of @xmath104 , close to the value reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , thanks to a long - term photometric data - set spanning from 1982 to 2003 , obtained a rotational period value of @xmath105 , as well as the pole position and shape model .",
    "we observed 3199  _ nefertiti _ during two nights in january and february 2003 using the scam-1 ccd camera at pd station .",
    "the composite unfiltered lightcurve , ( figure  [ fig : nefertiti - lc ] ) , shows a nearly sinusoidal trend with four well - defined extrema , as well as an amplitude of @xmath106  mag .",
    "we derived a synodic rotational period of @xmath107 , in good agreement with the values obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this small apollo - type asteroid ( @xmath108 0.17 - 0.38  km ) was discovered by the linear survey in october 2004 .",
    "we observed this asteroid at pd station using the ccd itanet camera .",
    "@xmath12 filter photometric observations were collected during its close path to the earth in november , 2004 , when the asteroid reached its maximum apparent @xmath11 brightness of about @xmath109  mag .",
    "unfortunately , we were able to observe 2004  ue only during one night both due to bad weather conditions and the short time - span of the favorable apparition .",
    "the @xmath12 lightcurve is presented in figure  [ fig:2004ue - lc ] .",
    "we derived a synodic rotational period value of @xmath110 and a magnitude variation of @xmath111  mag .",
    "the lightcurve shows a smoothed trend with four nearly symmetrical extrema .",
    "the large amplitude value and the regular trend of the lightcurve might indicate an elongated shape without large surface dishomogeneities .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for his / her careful reading , useful comments , and suggestions that helped us to improve the manuscript .",
    "we thank padova astronomical observatory for the use of the 67/92-cm schmidt telescope .",
