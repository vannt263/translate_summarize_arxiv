    "following the foundation laid down by einstein@xcite , discussions on the phenomena of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) have been of constant interest to physicists and can be found in standard textbooks on statistical physics.@xcite the conventional treatment is usually based on the grand canonical ensemble within the context of an ideal bose gas and the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the recent beautiful experiments@xcite on bec in atomic gases , however , lead to the need of a deeper understanding of the problem of bec in confined systmes with finite number of bosons .",
    "the fact that the number of bosons is finite and relatively small in the trap created experimentally and that the ultracold atomic gas does not exchange particles with reserviors implies that the canonical ensemble is more appropriate.@xcite    it is interesting to study how the thermodynamical quantities such as the specific heat evolves as the number of particles in the system increases . in fermion systems , the differences among results obtained within the different ensembles have been studied.@xcite recently , there have been some work on finite boson systems in a parabolic confinement within the context of micro - canonical and canonical ensembles.@xcite in the present work , using the grand partition function as the generating function of the partition function , an iterative scheme is established for the calculation of the partition function of system with an arbitrary number of particles .",
    "the scheme is applied to bosons confined in isotropic and anisotropic traps and in rigid boxes in arbitrary spatial dimensions . in particular , we aim out studying the effects of dimensionality , anisotropy , and finite number of particles .",
    "although there exist many interesting approaches to the problem in the literature,@xcite we concentrate on comparing our results , wherever possible , with those in the conventional theory and in the semiclassical theory of bagnato _ et al._,@xcite which is basically an extension of the conventional theory to the case with confining potentials .",

    "results for bosons confined in isotropic and anisotropic parabolic potentials are given in sec .",
    "the corresponding results for confinement in rigid boxes are given in sec .",

    "we consider a system of @xmath0 non - interacting bosons .",
    "the partition function @xmath1 is related to the @xmath0-th derivative with respect to the fugacity @xmath2 of the grand partition function @xmath3 through @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the temperature and @xmath6 is the fugacity . here @xmath7 is the variable representing the volume of the system for confinement in a rigid box and the confining strength in the case of a parabolic confining potential . in general , the grand partition function for an ideal bose gas can be written as@xcite @xmath8 where the product is over all the single particle states labelled by @xmath9 with energies @xmath10 , and @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the boltzmann constant .",
    "the zeros of the chemical potential and the single particle energy are set to be the same .",
    "combining eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) gives a relation @xmath13 between the partition function @xmath14 of a @xmath0-particle system and the partition functions @xmath15 , with @xmath16 , for systems with less than @xmath0 particles .",

    "these conditions , when substituted into eqs.(3)-(5 ) , give the correct single particle partition function @xmath29 and its derivatives .",
    "it should be pointed out that these conditions are independent of the form of the confining potential and spatial dimension .",
    "the effects of the confinement are reflected in the energy spectrum and the explicit form of eqs.(3)-(5 ) when they are applied to specific problems . in what follows ,",
    "we apply eqs.(3)-(5 ) to systems with finite number of non - interacting bosons confined either in a parabolic potential or in a rigid box . in particular ,",

    "et al._.@xcite the difference comes from our choice of setting the zero of energy at the ground state energy of a @xmath44-dimensional harmonic oscillator .",

    "1(a ) , it is obvious that the results obtained numerically using eqs.(7)-(10 ) agree well with the results obtained from the exact expression given by eq.(12 ) .",
    "this , in turn , indicates that our iterative approach is reliable . in 1d ,",
    "the specific heat approaches its large @xmath0 limit very rapidly in that the curves corresponding to systems with @xmath50 and @xmath51 particles are very close to each other .",
    "as temperature increases , @xmath20 approaches its limiting value of @xmath52 .",
    "in contrast to 2d and 3d systems , @xmath20 varies smoothly with temperature and there is no cusp .",
    "this implies that there is no bec in 1d system with parabolic confinement .",
    "this result is consistent with that of the semiclassical treatment of bagnato and kleepner.@xcite these authors studied bec in traps within the grand canonical ensemble and the thermodynamic limit so that the notion of a density of states is valid .",
    "they found that 1d ideal bose gas will display bec only if the external potential is more confining than the parabolic form .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows that cusp appears in the specific heat when the number of particles in the system is large enough in 2d isotropic parabolic confinement .",
    "the position of the cusp shifts to higher temperature as the number of particles increases . as there will be , strictly speaking , no sharp transition in a system with finite number of particles , the appearance of a cusp in the specific heat",
    "is taken to be an indication of bec .",
    "for system with @xmath53 particles , the cusp is at a temperature @xmath54 ; while the semiclassical treatment@xcite gives a transition temperature @xmath55 at @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",

    "parabolic confinement , the specific heat shows a cusp as a function of temperature for systems with large enough @xmath0 with the position of the cusp shifts up in temperature as @xmath0 increases and approaches a limit ( see fig.1(c ) ) .",

    "however , as temperature increases , @xmath20 increases again and eventually approaches the 2d limit of @xmath72 at high temperature .",
    "this behaviour can be understood in that the anisotropy leads to different energy spectra in the two directions . at low temperature ,",
    "only the levels corresponding to the less confining direction are populated and thus the system appears to behave in a one - dimensional way . at higher temperature ,",
    "the levels corresponding to the larger confining direction start to become populated and the system takes on two - dimensional character .",
