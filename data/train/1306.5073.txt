    "quantum tunnelling of substitutional defect ions in alkali halide crystals leads to particular low temperature properties @xcite . due to their misfit in size or shape such defect ions",
    "are confined to a potential energy landscape with a few degenerate off - center potential wells typically resulting in a finite electric and elastic moment for the defect . at defect concentrations above 100 ppm one",
    "typically faces a complicated many body problem @xcite of interacting defects . over a wide range of very large concentrations in the percent regime",
    "the system then shows glassy behaviour@xcite , i.e. the low temperature universal properties of glasses , as revealed in the nearly linear specific heat and the particular characteristics related to phonon attenuation@xcite .",
    "however , at concentrations lower than 100 ppm the situation can be described by isolated tunneling systems .",
    "using a simplified two - states model allows to describe the thermal and dielectric properties @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the acoustic response shows a more complex behaviour reflecting the defect geometry and the according tensor character of the elastic moment @xcite .",
    "relaxation of the defect as well as the dielectric and acoustic losses are caused by the coupling to phonons and are generally described within a spin boson type model assuming weak defect phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "the defect - phonon coupling strength is given by the acoustic ( or elastic ) moment @xmath0 of the defect and it is typically estimated from experimental results on either the acoustic response @xmath1 , with the speed of sound @xmath2 and the defect concentration @xmath3 , or on the relaxation rate @xmath4 with the tunnel coupling @xmath5 of the defect .",
    "thus , @xmath0 can not be determined independently from @xmath5 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "most experimental data is acquired in samples with defect concentrations @xmath6 ppm , where many body effects complicate the situation .",
    "accordingly , due to experimental uncertainties it remains unclear whether the weak coupling assumption holds . from a first - principle argumentation one actually expects rather strong defect - phonon couplings @xcite .",
    "treating the dynamics within a two - state spin phonon model allows to conclude that the dynamics at low temperatures is effectively always underdamped irrespective of defect - phonon coupling strength @xcite due to the super - ohmic spectrum of phonons .",
    "thus , the question regarding to weak or strong defect - phonon coupling might seem hypocritical .",
    "we show , however , that a defect model incorporating the full 3d geometry results in acoustic and dielectric responses which qualitatively differ with the strength of the defect - phonon coupling . in detail , we find that strong defect - phonon coupling reduces the cubic symmetry of the defect effectively to inversion symmetry in the same way as observed for strong interdefect couplings @xcite .",
    "defect phonon coupling dresses , and thus suppresses , tunnelling except for tunnelling along paths reflecting inversion symmetry , which accordingly dominate at strong coupling . in turn",
    ", this provides a tool to differentiate experimentally between weak and strong defect - phonon coupling .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : in the next section we briefly introduce substitutional tunnelling defects in more detail .",
    "then we present our model for a [ 111 ] defect and its coupling to phonons . in the following section we introduce the polaron transformation to decouple the defect from the phonons and",
    "then we calculate the dielectric and acoustic response .",
    "finally , we discuss the experimental relevance of our results for [ 111 ] defect systems like kcl : li and kcl : cn and end with a conclusion .",
    "typical defect systems are kcl doped with li , oh or cn molecules .",
    "the potential energy landscape in which the defect ion moves is given by the host crystal and therefore reflects its symmetry which for most alkali halide crystals is cubic ( e.g. the fcc - structure of potassium chloride ) .",
    "there are only three multi - well potentials which are consistent with this symmetry @xcite : twelve wells at the edges of a cube , six wells in the middle of the surfaces and eight wells at the corners of a cube . regarding polar molecules like cn and oh ,",
    "the potential wells reflect equivalent molecular orientations whereas corresponding off - center positions arise for the small lithium ion .",
    "off - center positions as well as molecular orientations for the defect ions have two immediate consequences : it separates the centres of charge and leads to a local distortion of the crystal . hence both an electric dipole moment and an elastic quadrupole moment",
    "is connected to the defect which can thus interact with lattice vibrations , external fields or neighbouring defects .",
    "consequently only at low defect concentrations , typically below 100 ppm , one can describe the situation by isolated tunnelling systems . with rising concentration pairs , triples etc .",
    "of defects are involved until finally one faces a complicated many body system @xcite .    at low temperatures",
    "thermally activated crossing over potential barriers is inhibited for the defect ions and quantum tunnelling remains which typically leads to a ground state splitting of about 1 kelvin . since the number density of such tunnelling states exceeds , even at low concentration , that of small - frequency phonon modes of the host crystal , the impurities govern the low - temperature properties of the material .",
    "the dopants cn and li in kcl favor 8 defect positions in [ 111]-directions and the dopant oh 6 positions in [ 100]-directions . we focus on defects with 8 minima in the [ 111]-direction ( see fig .",

    "@xcite find that both are roughly of the same size which points towards our proposed mechanism renormalizing one tunnel coupling to lower values while the geometrically suppressed tunnel coupling is unrenormalized .",
    "we have discussed the dielectric and acoustic response of a [ 111 ] tunnelling defect , as for example , kcl doped with li or cn impurities .",
    "we have shown that phonon dressing of tunnelling only suppresses tunnelling along paths which are not inversion symmetric . since the [ 111 ] defect exhibits a geometrically subdominant tunnel path along a space diagonal ( and thus an inversion symmetric path ) , this tunnelling dominates for strong defect phonon coupling when phonon dressing suppresses all other tunnelling paths .",
    "thus , we have shown that assuming strong defect - phonon coupling dielectric and acoustic response are governed by different tunnel couplings in contrast to the weak coupling case where only one tunnel coupling dominates .",
    "this results in clear qualitative differences which allow easy experimental verification . comparing our results with available experimental data",
    "we find that li impurities are only weakly coupled to phonons but cn impurities are stronger coupled putting this case in an intermediate regime .",
    "we propose to carefully study dielectric response in these systems to fully characterize the defect - phonon coupling .",
    "furthermore our results might help to shed light on the microscopic nature of the tunnelling systems in disordered solids responsible for their universal low temperatures properties dominated by inversion symmetric tunnelling states @xcite .",
    "when @xmath175 is fulfilled , we observe relaxation behaviour with a finite loss contribution and strong frequency dependence in both , loss and the real part of the suszeptibility . for experimental frequencies in the khz regime such",
