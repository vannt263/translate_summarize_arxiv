    "the interest in polyacetylene was revived recently by many reasons . from the theoretical point of view , it can been considered a 1d version of graphene , at least with respect to the fractionalization of the electric charge @xcite . from the experimental and technological sides , the advent of the _ semiconductor nanotechnology _",
    "@xcite with new possibilities of developing semiconductor devices made from polyacetylene  @xcite strongly motivated the study of transport properties of conducting 1d polymers @xcite .",
    "polyacetylene is a 1d chain of @xmath0 groups with alternating single and double bonds .",
    "the system is half filled , i.e. , has one electron per site and , in the tight binding approximation , it would be a metal .",
    "however , due to the interaction of the electrons with the lattice or , the spontaneous peierls dimerization , the polyacetylene is an insulator . after doping , the conductivity of _",
    "trans_-polyacetylene is greatly increased , reaching metal - like properties  @xcite .",
    "the model which describes the electron - phonon interactions is the celebrated su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) hamiltonian  @xcite , whose continuum version is known as the takayama  lin - liu  maki ( tlm ) model @xcite .",
    "the tlm model is a relativistic field theory with two - flavor dirac fermions .",
    "we shall use the gross - neveu ( gn ) model @xcite in 1 + 1 dimensions since its lagrangian is equivalent to that of the tlm model @xcite , and will provide us with analytic solutions . in the field theory context , the discrete chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the gn model ( at zero temperature and chemical potential ) , and there is the dynamical generation of a mass ( gap ) for the electrons .",
    "the ( global ) external chemical potential @xmath1 is introduced in the theory to represent the extra electrons that are supplied in the system by the doping process . at a critical chemical potential @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 for trans-@xmath5 ) is the constant band - gap",
    ", the gn model undergoes a first order phase transition to a symmetry restored ( zero gap ) phase  @xcite .",
    "the critical doping concentration  @xcite @xmath6 can be related with the critical chemical potential as @xmath7  @xcite , where @xmath8 is the number of spin degrees of freedom of the ( delocalized ) @xmath9 electron , @xmath10 is the planck s constant divided by @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the fermi velocity , @xmath13 is the fermi wavenumber , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the lattice ( equilibrium ) spacing between the @xmath17 coordinates of successive @xmath18 radicals in the undimerized structure . @xmath19  @xcite is the intercarbon transfer integral for @xmath9 electrons , or simply the  hopping parameter \" , resulting in @xmath20 for trans-@xmath5 , which is of the order of the velocity of the dirac fermions in graphene  @xcite . employing the gn model in the large-@xmath21 ( mean - field ) approximation , previous work  @xcite found a very good agreement with the experimentally found @xmath6 ( @xmath22 .",
    "recent calculations including finite corrections to @xmath21 improved the theoretical prediction for @xmath6 , and showed that @xmath6 is solely weakly affected by thermal effects  @xcite .",
    "the novelty is brought about by an `` asymmetrical doping '' , defined as an imbalance between the chemical potentials of the electrons with the two possible spin orientations (  up \" @xmath23 , and ",
    "down \" @xmath24 ) inserted in the system by the doping process .",
    "since the densities of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 electrons are directly proportional to their chemical potentials , we investigate the consequences of the asymmetrical doping in the magnetic properties of the _ trans_-polyacetylene .",
    "experimentally , the chemical potential asymmetry can be achieved by the actuation of an external magnetic field on the system , which breaks the spin-@xmath27 su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "we show that with low imbalanced doping ( with respect to the critical doping ) , the energy gap is zero , although there is an imbalance between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 electron populations .",
    "the situation changes substantially with strong imbalanced doping , favoring one of the movers from the two spin orientations ( @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) . in this case",
    ", the system acquires a small but stable non - zero gap @xmath28 , and there is an absence of the not favored spin oriented electron .",
    "we argue that this may have observable consequences in the magnetic properties of the asymmetrically doped polyacetylene ( adp ) .",
    "the lagrangian density of the tlm model in the adiabatic approximation ( i.e. , neglecting the lattice vibrations ) is given by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a two component dirac spinor @xmath31 , representing the  left - moving \" and  right - moving \" electrons close to their fermi energy , respectively , and @xmath32 is an internal symmetry index ( spin ) that determines the effective degeneracy of the fermions .",
    "we define @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the gamma matrices are given in terms of the pauli matrices , as @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 is a ( real ) gap related to lattice vibrations , @xmath38 is a dimensionless coupling , where @xmath39 is the @xmath9-electron - phonon coupling constant of the original ssh hamiltonian , and @xmath40 is the elastic chain deformation constant .",
    "the equivalence between the tlm and the gross - neveu ( gn ) model , is established by setting @xmath41 .",
    "the partition function of the gn model in the imaginary time formalism  @xcite is given by    @xmath42[d \\psi ] exp { \\int_0^{\\beta } d\\tau \\int dx~({l}_{\\rm gn } ) } , \\label{partfun}\\ ] ]    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath45 is the euclidean gn lagrangian .",
    "the @xmath46 can be doped after synthesis both by using chemical or electrochemical techniques .",
    "if an electrochemical process is being used to add electrons through external circuits , the polymer is being reduced .",
    "when the doping removes electrons it is said that the polymer is being oxidized . in the standard way ,",
    "the chemical potential is introduced in the theory by adding to @xmath47 the term @xmath48 , which means that the same quantity of @xmath25 and @xmath26 electrons is being inserted in the system .",
    "the asymmetrical doping is established by adding to @xmath47 a term @xmath49 , with @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "we will also choose @xmath52 since , as we will see next , this is the chemical potential at which the minimum of @xmath53 jumps ( when @xmath54 ) from @xmath3 to @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . integrating over the fermion fields we obtain    @xmath61    where @xmath62 $ ] , and @xmath63 are the matsubara frequencies for fermions . summing over @xmath64 and carrying out the determinantal operation , we find    @xmath65 , \\label{partfun3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 is the 1d  volume \" , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath76 has lifted the degeneracy of the conduction @xmath77 and valence @xmath78 bands in the matter part of @xmath72 .",
    "the renormalized effective potential turns out to be    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is an arbitrary renormalization scale .",
    "the minimization of @xmath75 with respect to @xmath69 gives the well - known result  @xcite    @xmath81    at finite chemical potentials and in the zero temperature limit , we have    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the fermi momentum of the @xmath25(@xmath26 ) moving electron . we integrate in @xmath84 , observing that the renormalization is the same as before , to obtain    @xmath85\\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\frac{\\theta_2}{2\\pi \\hbar v_f } \\left[\\delta^2 \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mu_\\downarrow + \\sqrt{\\mu_\\downarrow^2-\\delta^2}}{\\delta } \\right ) -\\mu_\\downarrow \\sqrt{\\mu_\\downarrow^2-\\delta^2 } \\right ] , \\label{potefff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 is the step function , defined as @xmath87 , for @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , for @xmath90 .",
    "minimizing @xmath53 with respect to @xmath69 yields the trivial solution ( @xmath91 ) , and    @xmath92    where we have made use of eq .",
    "( [ deltaopt ] ) to eliminate @xmath80 in the gap equation .",
    "the ground state is determined by jointly finding the solutions of the equation above @xmath93 , and the analysis of the effective potential at the minimum , @xmath94 . in the sds , defined for @xmath54 , the solution @xmath95 represents a minimum of @xmath96 while @xmath97 , ( where the critical chemical potential , @xmath98 , is obtained by @xmath99 ) , and @xmath91 is a local maximum . when @xmath100 , @xmath101 is a local maximum and @xmath91 is turned into a minimum through a first order phase transition  @xcite , agreeing with experiment  @xcite .",
    "thus , the gap as a function of the chemical potential in the sds has the following expression :    @xmath102    the situation changes significantly in an asymmetrically doped system , where @xmath91 still represents the minimum of @xmath53 for @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is obtained from the equality @xmath105 , with @xmath106 being the solution of eq .  ( [ min2 ] ) for @xmath107 . for @xmath108",
    ", the @xmath109 function prevents the  @xmath26 \" term in the effective potential of participating in the minimum .",
    "thus , eq .",
    "( [ min2 ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath110    we show in fig .",
    "( [ veff ] ) the ( non - dimensional ) function @xmath111 for @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , as a function of @xmath117 .",
    "we see that the minimum of @xmath111 for @xmath118 is at @xmath91 , while for @xmath119 , a narrow gap @xmath120  appears \" through a first order ( quantum ) phase transition .",
    "however , this transition now is from @xmath91 to @xmath121 , i.e. , is in opposite direction from that observed in sds ( @xmath54 ) , as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath111 shows that the gap will eventually vanish for very high asymmetry , or @xmath122 .",
    "as we mentioned , the imbalance in the chemical potentials of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 electrons can be caused by the application of a static magnetic field @xmath123 , perpendicular to the wire , with a zeeman energy @xmath124",
    "@xcite , where @xmath125 , @xmath126 is the effective @xmath127factor , @xmath128 is the bohr magneton , @xmath129 is the bare electron mass , and @xmath130 is the magnetic field strength . in the present case @xmath131 .",
    "the number densities @xmath132 are obviously imbalanced due to the asymmetry between @xmath133 and @xmath134 , and will depend on @xmath76 . before the critical asymmetric doping , @xmath135 , and the densities",
    "read    @xmath136    for such a low imbalance , compared to the critical chemical potential asymmetry @xmath104 , the total number density , @xmath137 , is the same as in the symmetric limit or , in other words , is independent of the applied field :    @xmath138    this partial spin polarization results in a net magnetization  @xcite of the chain    @xmath139    the magnetic susceptibility in the low asymmetrical doping regime is    @xmath140    which is exactly the pauli expression for noninteracting electrons .",
    "increasing the asymmetry beyond the critical value means that , effectively , only @xmath25-moving electrons of the conduction band are present in the system . in terms of this",
    " higher \" chemical potential asymmetry the densities are    @xmath141    where @xmath142 in the equation above is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ min4 ] ) for a given @xmath143 , and    @xmath144    meaning that the system is fully polarized .",
    "the total number density is now    @xmath145    in the fully spin polarization regime the magnetization of the chain reads    @xmath146    the magnetic susceptibility in this regime is given by a rather involved expression    @xmath147    that clearly does not have the simple form of the pauli susceptibility .",
    "finally we find the critical magnetic field separating the partially and fully polarized magnetic phases @xmath148 , yielding    @xmath149    which is a magnetic field of very high intensity , compared to the maximum current laboratory values , that are up to @xmath150 ( dc - magnetic fields ) , and up to @xmath151 ( mega - gauss fields )  @xcite . +",
    "to summarize , we have investigated the mean - field zero - temperature phase diagram of a 1d polymer upon asymmetric doping .",
    "our main finding is that an adp can be converted into a partially or fully magnetized organic wire , depending on the level of doping imbalance , i.e. , the difference between the @xmath25 and @xmath26 electron densities , induced by an external magnetic field .",
    "although the ( critical ) magnetic field @xmath152 necessary for a fully magnetization of the polyacetylene be of very high magnitude , we have seen that any non - zero @xmath153 produces a net magnetization .",
    "this doable partial spin polarization can be a manifestation of the interesting `` itinerant magnetism '' , for which conduction electrons are responsible .",
    "it would also be desirable to study the polarization mechanism in the trans-@xmath154 at finite temperature , and the subsequent calculation of thermal effects on the magnetization , critical magnetic field , and susceptibility , within the field theory approach .",
    "we hope to address these issues in future .",
