    "more precisely , we abstract the skein relation of the regular isotopy version of the homflypt polynomial and use it as the basis of a new skein algorithm comprising two computational levels : on the first level we only apply the skein relation between _ mixed crossings _ , that is , crossings of different components , so as to produce _ unions of unlinked knots_. on the second level we evaluate our invariant on unions of unlinked knots , applying a new rule , which is based on the evaluation of the regular isotopy version of the homflypt polynomial , @xmath4 , on unions of unlinked knots , and which introduces a new variable .",

    "a given specialization of @xmath4 may have its own form of state summation .",

    "since we use the skein template algorithm to produce the first collection of states @xmath480 , this double state summation has a precedence ordering with these states produced first , then each @xmath396 is viewed as a stack of knots and the second state summation is applied . in this section",
    "we will discuss some examples for state summations for @xmath4 and then give examples of using the double state summation .",
    "we begin with a state summation for the bracket polynomial that is adapted to our situation .",
    "view figure  [ orbracket ] . at the top of the figure",
    "we show the standard oriented expansion of the bracket .",
    "if the reader is familiar with the usual unoriented expansion @xcite , then this oriented expansion can be read by forgetting the orientations .",
    "the oriented states in this state summation contain smoothings of the type illustrated in the far right hand terms of the two formulas at the top of the figure .",
    "we call these _ disoriented smoothings _ since two arrowheads point to each other at these sites .",

    "the difference equation eliminates the disoriented terms .",
    "it then follows easily from this difference equation that if we define a _ curly bracket _ by the equation    @xmath486    where @xmath487 is the diagram writhe ( the sum of the signs of the crossings of @xmath67 ) , then we have a homflypt type relation for @xmath488 as follows : @xmath489 this means that we can regard @xmath488 as a specialization of the homflypt polynomial and so we can use it as the invariant @xmath4 in our double state summation .",
    "the state summation for @xmath488 is essentially the same as that for the bracket , as we now detail .        from figure  [ orbracket ]",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath490 and @xmath491 here @xmath492 denotes the disoriented smoothing shown in the figure .",
    "these formulas then define the state summation for the curly bracket .",
    "the reader should note that the difference of these two expansion equations ( [ curlyplus ] ) and ( [ curlyminus ] ) is the difference formula ( [ curlybracket ] ) for the curly bracket in homflypt form .",

    "there are many other examples of specific double state summations for other choices of the specialization of the homflypt polynomial .",
    "for example , we can use the specialized homflypt state summation based on a solution to the yang - baxter equation as explained in @xcite .",
    "we could also take the specialization to be the alexander ",

    "medial construction _",
    "( associating a planar graph to a link diagram via a checkerboard coloring of the diagram so that each shaded region in the checkerboard corresponds to a graphical node and each crossing between shaded regions corresponds to an edge ) , one obtains an expression for the potts model as a bracket summation with new parameters @xcite .",
    "we wish to discuss the possible statistical mechanical interpretation of our generalized bracket state summation @xmath508 $ ] ( see eq .",

    "we shall extend the variables of our state sum so that the bracket calculation ( for the stacks of knots @xmath396 that correspond to skein template states ) is sufficiently general to support ( generalized ) potts models associated with these knots .",

    "the mixed interaction of topological change and physical evolution of the molecules in vitro may benefit from a mixed state summation that averages quantities respecting the hierarchy of interactions .",
    "remarkably , the process of separation and evaluation that we have described here is analogous to proposed processing of kinetoplast dna @xcite where there are huge links of dna circles and these must undergo processes that both unlink them from one another and produce new copies for each circle of dna .",

    "if the readers examines the wiki on kinetoplast dna , she will note that that topoisomerase ii figures crucially in the self - replication @xcite .",
    "we wondered whether we could have physical situations that would have the kind of a mixture that is implicit in this state summation , where the initial skein template state sum yields a sum over @xmath4-evaluations , and @xmath4 may itself have a state summation structure .",
    "one possible example in the physical world is a normal statistical mechanical situation , where one can have multiple types of materials , all present together , each having different energetic properties .",
    "this can lead to a mixed partition function , possibly not quite ordered in the fashion of our algorithm .",

    "mixed state models can occur in physical situations when we work with systems of systems .",
    "there are many examples of this multiple - tier situation in systems physical and biological .",
    "we look for situations where a double state sum would yield new information .",
