    "although this result is quite intuitive , the mechanism behind its universal form and its emergence from the system - specific quantum evolution remains the focus of active studies and debates up to this date  @xcite .",
    "the case of a _ periodically modulated _ quantum system coupled to a bath is even more challenging . no universal closed - form expression for the asymptotic state",
    "is known and hence one has to analyze the specific dynamics of the system of interest , analytically or numerically . when isolated , i.e. when the system is not coupled to a heat bath , periodically driven quantum systems have been extensively studied and a variety of intriguing phenomena have been discovered . on the single - particle level ,",

    "floquet states of many - body systems are presently actively explored by using the idea of a time-__in__dependent _ effective _ hamiltonian ( sometimes also termed ` floquet hamiltonian ' ) , whose eigenstates approximately coincide with the floquet states of the original time - dependent hamiltonian at stroboscopic instants of multiple periods of the underlying high - frequency periodic drive ; see the recent review by bukov _",

    "@xcite .",
    "clearly , the universal gibbs form of the density matrix comprises a strong appeal , so it is not surprising that several attempts have been made to generalize the idea to the case of periodically driven open quantum systems .",
    "for example , such a gibbs form arises in the model of a single particle subjected to a modulated harmonic potential  @xcite and systems in which the time dependence of the hamiltonian can be eliminated through a unitary transformation  @xcite . in case of non - integrable quantum systems , it is very tempting to use floquet states as the eigenbasis to write down the density matrix and then search for the limit where the latter acquires the gibbs form . but before doing so , one should make a guess as to what quantity should take the place for the energy @xmath4 in the diagonal elements , @xmath5 . a very natural idea that this role could be played by the average energy of the @xmath6-th floquet state ;",
    "i.e. , the expectation value of the hamiltonian averaged over one period of the driving , has been tested in refs .",
    "the results demonstrated that although the density matrices have diagonal elements reasonably close to the boltzmann factors ( though with an ` effective temperature ' different from the actual temperature of the heat bath ) , there is also a tangible deviation from the gibbs form .",
    "this difference was related to the coexistence of ( semi - classically ) chaotic and regular floquet states  @xcite .",
    "recently , some of the authors presented an alternative idea , upon introducing the notion of the floquet - gibbs states  @xcite , i.e. the states whose density matrices have gibbs form in the floquet basis of the system hamiltonian , with @xmath4 being the _ quasi_-energy of the corresponding floquet state .",
    "the main problem of using quasi - energies as effective energies @xmath4 is that they are mere phase factors and thus are defined up to multiples of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the driving frequency  @xcite . because of this ambiguity , quasi - energies have little to do with the actual energies of the corresponding floquet states .",
    "for example , two states of very different energies can come close to each other inside the first brillouin zone @xmath9 and produce an avoided crossing which leads to resonance effects  @xcite .",
    "in order to illustrate the conditions required to meet a floquet - gibbs state let us consider a time - dependent hamiltonian of the type @xmath10 with a time - periodic hermitian operator @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 being the control parameter to tune the strength of the modulation .",
    "then , the ambiguity related to the quasi - energies disappears when the condition     *",
    "\\(i ) the angular driving frequency @xmath8 has to be much larger than the spectral width of the system hamiltonian @xmath14     is obeyed .",
    "this condition implies that the energy spectrum of the system fits into the first brillouin zone and the natural way of ordering the quasi - energies exists .",
    "technically , this condition then requires fast driving .    in order to have the asymptotic density matrix diagonal in the floquet basis",
    ", it also has to be guaranteed that all dissipative effects are relevant on a time scale larger than _ any _ intrinsic characteristic timescale of the isolated system ( including the period of the driving @xmath15 ) . under this condition",
    "the evolution of the off - diagonal elements of the system density matrix becomes decoupled from the evolution of the diagonal elements so that the former decay exponentially fast in time .",
    "this amounts to a so - called ` rotating - wave approximation ' ( rwa )  @xcite . because the relaxation time is inversely proportional to the square of the system - bath coupling @xmath16 , @xmath17",
    ", the rwa is only valid when the system - bath coupling becomes infinitesimal .    finally , there are two further specific conditions that ensure the asymptotic states to be the floquet - gibbs state  @xcite :    * \\(ii ) the time - dependent part of the system hamiltonian , @xmath18 , should commute with itself at different instants of time , @xmath19 = 0 $ ] ; * \\(iii ) the time - dependent part of the system hamiltonian , @xmath18 , and the system - bath interaction hamiltonian should commute",
    ".    the three conditions , ( i - iii ) , therefore limit the class of suitable physical models .",
    "namely , condition ( i ) either restricts the system hilbert space to relatively small sizes _ or _ confines allowed modulations to the high - frequency limit ( where their effect is reduced to a mere re - normalization of the stationary hamiltonian ) . in contrast , condition ( ii ) is less serious ; it is fulfilled with the choice @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a time - periodic scalar function and @xmath22 is a system hermitian operator .",
    "most of the currently used models belong to this class  @xcite .",
    "condition ( iii ) requires fine - tuning of system - bath coupling operators , which is difficult to control .    with this work",
    "we address the following two questions :    * _ can the concept of floquet - gibbs states be extended to the case of a weak but _ finite _ system - bath coupling ?",
    "_ * _ can some of the conditions _",
    "( i - iii ) _ be relaxed ?",
    "_    assume that condition ( i ) is broken , but the system is subjected to high frequency periodic modulation . in this case",
    "the heating rate of the system , @xmath23 ( i.e. , the speed with which the modulations pump energy into the system  @xcite ) , is extremely large  @xcite .",
    "thus , when the system couples to the heat bath at weak but finite strength , the relaxation rate @xmath24 might be larger than the heating rate @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 , which substantially changes the asymptotic state ( see sec .",
    "[ condition ] for more details ) .",
    "also in this case the rwa is no longer applicable ( since @xmath27 is not the longest timescale ) and there is no guarantee that it will describe an approximately valid asymptotic state .    in order to go beyond the limit imposed by the condition ( i ) we need to avoid the ambiguity in the definition of effective energies and find a suitable candidate to test the hypothesis of effective floquet - gibbs states .",
    "the quasi - energies are not suitable for this purpose because there is no unique way to extract the ` correct ' effective hamiltonian .",
    "this is because the logarithm of the floquet unitary operator possesses many branches .",
    "the first intuitive candidate for a time - independent floquet hamiltonian is obtained by summing up the magnus expansion of the original system hamiltonian @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "however , when it comes to a technical realization of this idea , one faces a problem : the expansion simply does not converge  @xcite .",
    "this recently became an issue of active research in the field of many - body quantum physics  @xcite .",
    "there was a proposal to circumvent this obstacle by truncating the magnus series and it was claimed that such an approximation could accurately describe the long - lived transient states  @xcite .",
    "in this situation one not only obtains uniquely defined ` effective energies ' , that are eigenvalues of the truncated floquet hamiltonian , but also the eigenbasis is more preferable than the floquet basis to express the asymptotic non - equilibrium state .    condition ( iii ) becomes irrelevant when the response of the bath to the high frequency driving field is weak , e.g. , the frequency of the driving field is much larger than the cutoff frequency of the bath spectral density @xmath29 . here",
