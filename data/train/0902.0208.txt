    "a physical connection between the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) was implied as early as 60 years ago @xcite . a continuous gas structure between the lmc and the smc , known as the magellanic bridge ( mb ) ,",
    "was first reported by @xcite , and it is found to be at a distance of @xmath15060  kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there is substantial evidence for a young stellar population in the mb , with stars as young as @xmath15  myrs @xcite and with molecular clouds detected @xcite .",
    "these young populations were probably formed locally , because they are not old enough to have escaped from the next nearest star - forming region ( i.e. , the smc ) based on their peculiar motions . on the other hand , the larger - scale tidal structure that is connected to the mb , the magellanic stream , contains only gas , with no evidence of a stellar population @xcite .",
    "the physical connection of these structures are still under discussion @xcite .",
    "although the formation mechanism of the mb is not understood in detail , gravitational tidal interactions probably played a primary role ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the mb was created through a close interaction between the lmc and the smc about 0.2  gyr ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the mb is an ideal target for studies of the influence of dynamical interactions on star - forming activity .",
    "the mb also provides a unique opportunity to study nearby star formation in a low metallicity environment .",
    "the mb stars have metallicities of only one - tenth that of normal population i galactic stars ( i.e. , even smaller than the smc stars by @xmath10.5  dex ; @xcite ) .    the abundance pattern of the mb has been studied through stellar populations and gas clouds that are detected as absorption features in the stellar spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "recently , @xcite found a possible metallicity gradient in the smc toward outer regions from @xmath11 to @xmath14 degree from its center .",

    "analysis of interstellar gas should yield more representative properties of the mb and its abundance pattern .",
    "quasar absorption lines are powerful tools to investigate the physical conditions of absorbers located along sight - lines to quasars .",
    "these absorbers are detected in quasar spectra , regardless of the source luminosity , which enables us to collect a homogeneous sample of absorbing clouds from early cosmic epochs to the present .",
    "although there have been several attempts to trace the mb gas along the sight - lines toward quasars , these were based on radio - spectra that covered  21-cm absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or optical spectra that covered the absorption doublet @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , most important ions ( e.g. , , , , , and ) have their resonance transitions in the rest - frame ultra - violet ( uv ) region .",
    "their observed wavelengths are still in the uv region for low - redshift targets like the mb .    in this paper , we report on the general physical conditions and chemical composition of the mb gas far from the location of stellar populations , through quasar absorption line analysis .",
    "we chose the sight - line toward a radio - loud quasar pks  0312@xmath2770 at @xmath16 = 0.223 that passes through the mb ( figure  1 ) at a heliocentric distance of @xmath150  kpc ( similar to the distance of the smc ) . because the quasar is radio loud we are also able to detect neutral hydrogen gas as  21-cm emission / absorption features . @xcite",
    "reported detections of such features with three components at a heliocentric velocity of @xmath0 @xmath1200  .",
    "based on their fitting results , they estimated a total neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath17 = 1.2@xmath1810@xmath19  and mean spin temperatures of @xmath20 = 22 , 29 , and 46 @xmath21 for the three components .",
    "although the measured spin temperatures are contaminated by warm gas structures that are not related to the absorbing components , they are similar to the spin temperatures of the lmc ( @xmath22 = 3040  @xmath21 ; @xcite ) and the smc ( @xmath22 = 2050  @xmath21 ; @xcite ) , and slightly smaller than that of m31 ( @xmath22 @xmath170  @xmath21 ; @xcite ) .",

    "the stis spectrum covers various absorption lines detected at @xmath28 , including ( ly@xmath10 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and ) arising either from local absorbers in the milky way , from high - velocity clouds , from the mb or from higher redshift absorbers at @xmath16 = 0.1983 , 0.2018 , 0.2026 , and 0.2029 @xcite .",
    "absorption lines arising from the mb ( that are our main targets ) are marked in figure  2 , and their rest - frame equivalent widths or detection limits are listed in table  2 .",
    "we can effectively separate absorption profiles of the mb from those of the milky way and the high - velocity clouds , because their velocity separations are large enough ( the mb and the hvc are redshifted from the milky way by @xmath1200 and 300 , respectively ) . only ly@xmath10",
    "is not separated because it is hidden in the broad damping wing of the milky way absorption .",
    "the total column density of this system ( including contributions from the milky way , the mb , and the hvc altogether ) was measured to be  ( / [ ] ) @xmath120.85 @xcite , or @xmath120.87 @xcite .",
    "as estimated below using photoionization modeling , the total column density of the mb toward the quasar pks  0312 - 770 is  ( / [ ] ) @xmath120.2 , just below the lower - limit of the criterion for damped ly@xmath10  system ( dla ) .",
    "the total rest - frame equivalent width of ( @xmath29(2796 ) = 1.91 ) is also large enough for classification as a strong system ( whose minimum equivalent width is @xmath29(2796 ) = 0.3 ) .",
    "absorption systems , classified as strong systems , are usually associated with bright ( @xmath30 @xmath26 0.05@xmath31 ) galaxies within 40@xmath32 kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ionization state of the system , in which we detect very strong low - ionization transitions such as and and which has either weak or undetected high - ionization transitions ( e.g. , and ) , is very low , as is often the case with dla systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , this system in the mb is probably a local counterpart of dla systems at higher redshift .",
    "we also confirmed that all absorption features in this system are clean without contamination by absorption lines of other systems at higher redshift .",
    "visual inspection of the velocity plot of the mb system also suggests that the physical and chemical conditions of this system are somewhat similar to those of another absorber detected in the mb toward the young stars , di  1388 and dgik  975 @xcite : ( i ) having absorption lines with various ionization potentials from and to and , and",
    "( ii ) showing strong neutral transitions such as and .",
    "@xcite derived several properties of the system toward di  1388 : ( a ) dust depletion is moderate and its pattern is similar to that of the galactic halo , and ( b ) the metallicity is lower than that in the solar neighborhood by 1.1  dex , and still lower by 0.5  dex than in the smc . using photoionization models , we estimate these parameters toward the quasar , pks  0312@xmath2770 , separated by @xmath14.1 degree ( i.e. , @xmath14.3  kpc at the distance of the smc ) from di  1388 , so that we can study the variety of physical conditions in the mb .",
    "we determine the number of components needed to reproduce the observed spectrum and measure their line parameters ( i.e. , column density , doppler parameter , and radial velocity ) using voigt profile fitting .",
    "@xcite detected three  21-cm absorption components in their radio spectrum of pks  0312 - 770 taken with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the  21-cm absorption lines are due to cool atomic hydrogen regions that probably have similar physical conditions to dla systems",
    ".    following @xcite , we first used three components to fit other metal absorption profiles in our _ hst_/stis spectrum .",
    "however , we found a three component fit insufficient because the line widths of the three components presented in @xcite ( fwhm = 9.6 , 13.2 , and 10.5  , corresponding to @xmath33 = 5.8 , 7.6 , and 6.3  ) could not reproduce the wing profiles at both sides of the metal absorption features .",
    "for example , figure  3 shows a comparison between the observed and modeled  @xmath251302 profiles .",
    "we assumed that the doppler parameters of oxygen and hydrogen were the same for this purpose , i.e. that turbulence dominates @xmath34 , since that yields the maximum value for @xmath35 .",
    "if we increase the column density of , damping wings appear before our model reproduces both sides of the observed spectrum . to resolve this discrepancy , we refit the  21-cm absorption lines , using the voigt profile fitting code ( minfit ; @xcite ) ( instead of using gaussian fits as in @xcite ) .    these measurements of the column densities require some assumptions .",
    "we calculated them by @xmath36 where @xmath22 is the spin temperature in degrees kelvin , and @xmath37 is the  21-cm optical depth .",
    "we adopted the spin temperatures from @xcite .",
    "then by integrating the optical depth of the model profile that we best fit to the observed spectrum , we calculated the column densities .",
    "our best fit parameters are listed in the first three rows of table  3 .",
    "the column densities are large enough to be classified as sub - dlas ( i.e. ,  ( / [ ] ) @xmath26 19 ) ) .",
    "the total column density after adding up the three components will be  = 1.27@xmath38 [ ] , which is consistent with the values measured in past studies using different radio telescopes with different beams on the sky : 15@xmath38 [ ] @xcite , 12@xmath38 [ ] @xcite , 1.7@xmath38 [ ] @xcite , 1.3@xmath38 [ ] @xcite , and 7.1@xmath38 [ ] as an upper limit including contributions from our galaxy @xcite .",
    "these line widths are slightly broader than those found previously by @xcite . using three components with these larger doppler parameters to fit the",
    ", we found it possible to reproduce the high - velocity side of  @xmath251302 by adjusting its column density to  ( / [ ] ) @xmath116 , as shown in figure  4 .",
    "the only remaining disagreement is an underproduction by the model of  @xmath251302 at the low - velocity side of the absorption profile . because a similar discrepancy is seen in other metal absorption lines , such as , , and , there is probably an additional component at the low - velocity side of this system . assuming a fiducial line width of @xmath34 = 10  ( i.e.",
    ", the average doppler parameter of the other three  21-cm lines is 9.0  ) , we adjust both the line position and column density of and find the best combination : @xmath0 = 160.8  and  ( / [ ] ) @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , another strong constraint for this additional component comes from the radio observation .",
    "we can place an upper limit on the  21-cm line optical depth of this additional component at the line center , because we did not detect it at the appropriate wavelength in the  21-cm absorption spectrum .",
    "the s / n - ratio of the spectrum is @xmath140 at that wavelength , which corresponds to a 1@xmath27 optical depth limit of @xmath39 = @xmath40 @xmath10.025 .",
    "as described in the next section , our best photoionization model for this component gives  ( / [ ] ) of 19.31 and @xmath34 of 13.0  for the line , whose optical depth at line center would be @xmath41 = 0.022 , smaller than the 1@xmath27 detection limit in the radio spectrum ( figure  5 ) .",
    "we assume the same spin temperature for this component as was measured for the closest component at @xmath0 = 175.8  ( @xmath22 = 22  @xmath21 ) .",
    "the line parameters for this additional component , determined from a fit to the are listed in the fourth line of table  3 .",
    "however , we will not consider this component in the discussion (   6 ) because the fitted line parameters are all based on an arbitrary doppler parameter .",
    "we briefly summarize our modeling procedure , although it is similar to previous studies ( e.g. , churchill & charlton 1999 ) . using the photoionization code cloudy , version 07.02.00 @xcite , for each of the five clouds ( the fifth one is introduced later ) we search for the best combinations of the fit parameters : 1 ) ionization parameter ( @xmath7 = @xmath42 $ ] , defined as the ratio of ionizing photons to the number density of hydrogen in the absorbing gas ) and 2 ) metallicity ( ) in solar units.@xmath43 , [ n / h]@xmath43 , and [ o / h]@xmath43 are @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively . ]",
    "the mb is likely to be confined and compressed by its interaction with the galactic halo , but this does not produce shock ionization @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider only photoionization .",
    "we optimize on the observed column densities of or other metal ions ( i.e. , and ) that are listed in the first column of table  3 , that is we require the cloudy models to produce those column densities .",
    "for example , in the case of the component at @xmath0 @xmath1176  , we always fix the column density to  ( / [ ] ) = 19.59 , and search for the best values of @xmath7 and in a grid with steps of 0.1  dex , to reproduce as many absorption lines from other transitions as possible .",
    "we repeat this procedure for the other four components , individually .",
    "we assume that the absorbers are plane - parallel structures of constant density , and that they are in photoionization equilibrium .",
    "we initially adopt a solar abundance pattern , but also explore some variations based on the observational constraints . for the incident radiation field , we first consider a pure extragalactic background radiation with contributions from quasars and star forming galaxies ( with a photon escape fraction of 0.1 ) , following @xcite .",
    "we also explore the effects of other incident radiation fields , including fluxes from our galaxy and the lmc , as described in the next section .    for a given @xmath7 and , cloudy computes the column density of each element in various ionization stages , and the equilibrium gas temperature , @xmath47 .",
    "we can calculate the doppler parameter for each element using @xmath34 = @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the thermal broadening defined as @xmath49 = @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the broadening from gas turbulence and bulk motion .",
    "we use the measured @xmath34 for the transition on which we optimized ( listed in table  3 ) in order to calculate @xmath51 , which is then applied for other elements . using these derived line parameters from the model ,",
    "we synthesize a spectrum , after convolving the instrumental line spread function of _",
    "hst_/stis , and compare it to the observed spectrum .",
    "the synthesized spectra are compared to the observed spectrum by eye , because models with metallicity and ionization parameters that differ only slightly from the best values ( e.g. 0.1 or 0.2 dex ) would deviate significantly from the observed spectrum ( see figure  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , a formal procedure like @xmath52 fitting is not applicable because the system in the mb has various ( more than 10 ) transitions that we must consider simultaneously , and it is very difficult to determine how they should be weighted in a @xmath52 calculation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the transitions we optimize are and , and both have very low ionization potentials ( ip = 13.6  ev ) .",
    "as frequently reported for photoionization models of absorbers , the low - ionization phase clouds that produce absorption lines also produce other low - ionization transitions ( e.g. , , , and ) , but not high - ionization transitions ( e.g. , and ) .",
    "an additional high - ionization phase is almost always required to reproduce these transitions .",
    "therefore , we repeat line fitting and photoionization modeling for the high - ionization phase by optimizing high - ionization transitions ( in this study , as described below ) . finally , we synthesize a model spectrum including both low- and high - ionization phases , and compare it to the observed spectrum .    as described above , our method for deriving constraints on metallicities and ionization parameters of the absorbing gas relies on voigt profile fitting of separate components of the absorption profile of a particular transition which we feel is best constrained .",
    "we then use photoionization modeling to infer the column densities and doppler parameters of other transitions in these voigt profile component clouds .",
    "synthesized profiles from these models are compared to the data in order that we can place constraints on the parameters .",
    "although this method does rely on the assumptions behind the cloudy models , it has some advantages over simply taking the ratios of apparent column densities of selected transitions in order to determine metallicity .",
    "first of all , we can separately examine properties of individual clouds along the line of sight at different velocities .",
    "we are not averaging these components together , which the apparent column density method requires since it does not distinguish , for example , how much of the hydrogen is associated with the separate clouds . secondly , we can use the components determined from unsaturated lines in order to constrain the properties of those clouds using other saturated or partially saturated components as well .",
    "the measured doppler parameters for the unsaturated lines can be used along with the temperature given by a given cloudy model in order to determine model doppler parameters of other lines that may be saturated or blended . comparing the model to the shapes of the observed profiles of these lines , particularly the shapes of the sides of the profiles ,",
    "often yields meaningful constraints on parameters .",
    "models also take into account the appropriate ionization corrections in each case . in this way",
    "we can determine the range of acceptable parameters , considering all observational constraints .",
    "finally , we are able to consider separate phases of gas , having different densities and velocities along the line of sight , by comparing model predictions to the observations , component by component .      because the milky way ( mw ) and the lmc are located within several tens of kilo - parsecs of the mb , they also contribute as additional ionizing radiation sources .",
    "therefore , we consider three alternative incident radiation fields , ( i ) extra - galactic background ( egb ; @xcite ) plus radiation from the mw at a distance of @xmath53 = 50  kpc from the mw @xcite , ( ii ) a maximum flux model , with the egb , the mw radiation , plus radiation from the lmc with a 30  % escape fraction , and ( iii ) an intermediate case , with egb , the mw radiation , plus radiation from the lmc with a 15  % escape fraction .",
    "we construct these radiation fields following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "figure  6 shows the strength of the ionizing radiation from the mw and the lmc as a function of a distance from the center of the mw . at @xmath53 @xmath150  kpc , at which the mb is located ,",
    "the contribution from the lmc to the radiation field is significant . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution from the smc is negligible because of its low luminosity .",
    "the spectral shapes for each of the four incident radiation field models on the mb gas are plotted in figure  7 .",
    "the radiation from the mw and the lmc start to dominate the ebr at @xmath11(@xmath54/[hz ] ) @xmath4 16.1 , and strongly dominate over the ebr at @xmath11(@xmath54/[hz ] ) @xmath4 15.5 .",
    "normalizations for these fields , in units of the density of ionizing photons , and the contribution from the local flux sources ( mw and lmc ) compared to the ebr are summarized in table  4 .",
    "transitions that are detected in the _ hst_/stis spectrum and those that provide useful limits are shown in figure  8 , from the lowest ( , ip = 7.6  ev ) to highest ( , ip = 97.9  ev ) ionization potentials , following the ly@xmath10  profile in the first panel .",
    "we also display the observed  21-cm absorption profile @xcite . in figure  8 , 0  denotes the apparent optical depth - weighted median of the mb absorption system , corresponding to a heliocentric velocity of @xmath0 = 209.9  .",
    "a number of absorption lines from various ions ( i.e. , , , , , , , , , , , , and ) are detected . for",
    ", we can place only an upper limit on the equivalent width .",
    "the  @xmath252803 profile suffers from a data defect on its blue side , so we use the  @xmath252796 profile as the main constraint .",
    "since the  @xmath252853 profile is noisy ( i.e. s / n @xmath13.7 per pixel ) , it is only used as a loose constraint on models .    as a starting point for photoionization modeling , we roughly estimate possible ranges of gas temperature and ionization parameter ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the observed line widths of all transitions are similar , which suggests that bulk motion ( gas turbulence ) is a dominant source of line broadening .",
    "the relatively narrow 21-  cm lines , especially the one with @xmath56  , then imply that the gas temperature is very low .",
    "such a low temperature implies that the ionization parameter is also very small ( @xmath7 @xmath57 @xmath12 ) . for the metallicity",
    ", the value in the smc has been estimated as @xmath58 = 0.1  0.2 @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the following we explore metallicities and ionization parameters , in steps of 0.1 dex , in the ranges @xmath7 = @xmath27.0  @xmath24.0 and  = @xmath21.0  0.0 unless other parameter ranges are suggested .",
    "at first we seek the best photoionization model parameters for the three  21-cm clouds at  = @xmath234 , @xmath23 , and 26 from the system center ( i.e. , @xmath0 = 176 , 207 , and 236  ) that we determined in   3 , by optimizing a fit to the  21-cm absorption line .",
    "we require our model to reproduce the column density of from that fit . because the cloud at  = @xmath23  has clear detections in , , , and , without blending with other absorption features ,",
    "we begin with this cloud .",

    ", we decrease the nitrogen abundance by a factor of @xmath65 dex compared to its solar abundance pattern",
    ". the production mechanisms of nitrogen are poorly understood .",
    "however , a nitrogen deficiency in the smc has already been reported ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and similar deficiencies are seen in some dla systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) and weak systems @xcite . since and are strongly coupled in terms of their ionization , their ratio is often used as a measure of metallicity @xcite . in our case , the is highly saturated so that the voigt profile components can not be measured directly from the profile . however , once we have determined the metallicity from the weaker and profiles , we can verify that the favored model produces an / ratio consistent with these metallicities . for the @xmath23  component we find @xmath11[n()/n ( ) ] = @xmath23.81 , corresponding to = @xmath20.5 .",
    "the fact that this is consistent with the metallicity inferred from the weaker profiles confirms that ionization corrections are inferred properly from our models , and that the saturated profile has been separated self - consistently into voigt profile components .",
    "next , we consider the cloud at  = 26  . because this component has the largest recessional velocity , it should reproduce at the high - velocity side of all absorption features seen in the , , , and lines .",
    "we also require that the component reproduces the weak absorption .",

    "similarly , an upper limit of @xmath4 @xmath67 applies in order that is not over - produced . at the preferred value of  @xmath1@xmath68 , there is a strict lower limit on the ionization parameter of @xmath7 @xmath26 @xmath69 under which would be over - produced .",
    "we do not place any formal upper limit on the ionization parameter of this cloud , since the constraints from the relatively low signal - to - noise spectrum were not significant .",

    "because the third cloud at  = @xmath234  is heavily blended with the adjacent clouds , it is difficult to place strict constraints on its physical conditions .",
    "therefore , we simply note that its metallicity and ionization parameter could be very close to those of the cloud at  = 26  .",
    "several transitions , , , and , are over - produced for metallicities higher than  @xmath26 @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",

    "table  3 lists the best parameters of our photoionization models : column ( 1 ) is the optimized transition , column ( 2 ) is the heliocentric velocity of the absorption line , column ( 3 ) is relative velocity from the system center , columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are absorption optical depth at the line center and spin temperature measured from the  21-cm emission line ( only for  21-cm lines ) , columns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) are the best voigt profile fit values of column density and doppler parameter , columns ( 8) and ( 9 ) are the best model parameters ( assuming a solar abundance pattern ) of metallicity and ionization parameter , column ( 10 ) is gas temperature from our model , columns ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) are the gas volume density and the thickness of the absorber assuming a plane - parallel structure , and column ( 13 ) notes changes in the nitrogen abundance ( compared to the solar abundance pattern ) that are necessary to reproduce the observed spectrum . the synthesized spectrum , using the best model parameters , is overplotted on the observed spectrum for each transition in figure  8 .",
    "if we compare the models with / without nitrogen deficiency to the observed spectrum , it is obvious that the nitrogen deficiency is necessary , as shown in figure  9 .",

    "this is because the number of hydrogen ionizing photon is basically same by our assumption ( because we assume the same ionization parameter ) , however , the ionizing photons of some ions ( especially ions with low ionization potentials ) would be increased significantly once the additional radiation is considered .",

    "a galactic wind from the smc could enrich the mb with metals , and such a wind would likely be enhanced in alpha elements , given the composition of supernova - driven winds in other dwarf galaxies where such signatures are observed several kpc from their origin @xcite .",
    "the final possibility is in - situ enrichment from stars formed in the mb @xcite .",
    "given the @xmath1200  myr age of the mb @xcite , there has been ample time for several generations of the most massive b stars to evolve and contribute their nucleosynthetic products to their surroundings .",

    "the sightline toward our target , pks  0312 - 770 , has an angular separation of @xmath14.1@xmath83 from di  1388 , which corresponds to about @xmath14.4  kpc in physical scale at the distance of the smc ( @xmath84 @xmath160  kpc ) .",

    "one possible idea is that the sightline toward pks  0312 - 770 is not mixed with metal - poor gas , like the sightline toward di  1388 .",
    "if this is the case , absorbers with lower - metallicities should have higher total hydrogen column densities .",

    "si is synthesized in massive stars and returned to the interstellar medium through supernovae on timescales of @xmath110 myr .- elements released by supernovae remain for an extended period in hot @xmath85  k bubbles and require several hundred myr to mix with ambient galactic material @xcite .",

    "] thus , the n / si ratio may drop during prolonged starbursts and rise during prolonged periods of quiescence , functioning as a kind of `` clock '' , marking the time since the most recent major episode of star formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite used this scenario to model the chemical evolution of dla systems in the n / si vs. si / h plane and found that they could reproduce the properties of most dla systems as a function of two variables : the star formation efficiency and the age of the system .",
    "they concluded that small ages ( i.e. , less than 250  myr ) are required to produce the low n / si systems , while high star formation efficiencies lead to higher si / h and lower n / si ratios .",
    "however , a number of other processes may contribute to shaping the chemical evolution of a system .",
    "the arrows in figure  11 show qualitatively the four possible evolutionary vectors attributed to n enrichment ( vertically upward ) , @xmath10 enrichment ( toward the lower right ) , dust depletion ( toward upper left ) , and dilution by metal - poor gas ( leftwards ) .",
    "figure  11 shows that the 207  component toward pks  0312 - 770 is 0.30.4 dex more metal - rich than the bulk of the smc and other mb stars .",
    "this component also exhibits an n / si ratio that is 0.2  0.3 dex lower than the smc stars and regions .",
    "this departure is consistent with a composition consisting of smc material augmented by a small amount of @xmath10 enrichment from supernovae .",
    "none of the mb stars in figure  11 nor the ism probed toward the mb star di  1388 share this abundance pattern .",
    "the pks  0312 - 770 line of sight is therefore the first mb location with a metallicity that is similar to , or perhaps slightly higher than , the smc at large .",

    "if we reduce nitrogen abundance by only @xmath3 dex from the solar abundance pattern ( i.e. , same as the 176  component ) ,  @xmath251200b and  @xmath251201 would be reproduced better ( see figure  12 ) .",
    "] such a low n / si ratio places this material among the most n - deficient damped lyman alpha systems and suggests a nucleosynthetic history dominated by @xmath10-producing massive stars . in the @xcite models",
    ", such a low n abundance at such high metallicity can only be achieved by very efficient and very recent star formation such that massive stars dominate the mass - averaged nucleosynthetic contribution with virtually no contribution from longer - lived n - producing stars .",
    "given the presence of b stars in the mb ( e.g. , @xcite ) , some supernova activity during the @xmath4 200  myr lifetime of the mb is likely .",
    "in situ enrichment appears a plausible explanation for this component on the basis of chemical cloud .",
    "however , it is also possible that a si enrichment of ambient smc material plus dilution from putative metal - poor halo gas could also explain this data point ( i.e. , a combination of vectors that together drive evolution in figure  11 in a downward vertical direction from the smc regions composition ) .",
    "finally , the 176  component has a si / h ratio consistent with the smc and the 236  component , but the uncertainties on the n / si ratio are too large to place meaningful constraints on the origin of this material .",
    "moreover , abundance pattern would also be strongly affected by dust depletion and ionization conditions , which can only be explored with very high - s / n spectrum .",
    "therefore , this component may either be n - deficient or it may be consistent with the smc regions .",
    "in addition to various absorption lines we have detected in the _",

    ", they found that the abundance ratio of to in the mb is systematically higher than that of galactic gas by a factor of @xmath10.5 dex .",
    "@xcite proposed possible scenarios for this difference , such as the higher ionization condition of the hydrogen gas , and weaker dust - depletion in the mb . to test the scenario ,",
    "a higher - resolution spectrum will be necessary to deblend an unresolved  k profile into multiple components ( as we did for other transitions in the uv spectrum ) in order to constrain the photoionization model .    in   5 , we found the best model parameters .",
    "however , there is still an ambiguity due to the possible effects of dust , which would lead to different inferred physical conditions .",
    "our data was not of sufficient quality to measure dust depletion , but the estimated low gas temperature of the three clouds ( @xmath87 @xmath4 1000  k ) would imply that dust grains could survive in the absorber .",
    "moreover , the  k absorption strength , expected from our best model ( @xmath88=0.99 ) , is seven times greater than the observed value toward pks  032@xmath2770 ( @xmath88=0.14 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this also implies that the absorber contains substantial amounts of dust because calcium is one of the most severely depleted elements @xcite .",
    "actually , @xcite suggested si and fe in the mb toward di  1388 are depleted to dust by factors of @xmath89 and @xmath90 dex respectively , although the condition could be different toward pks  0312@xmath2770 .",
    "if depletion onto dust is significant , then the si abundances and the implied metallicities become even larger , making this sightline significantly more metal - enriched than the smc itself .",
    "damped ly@xmath10 systems ( dlas ) are characterized by high column densities ( i.e. ,  ( / [ ] ) @xmath78 @xmath91  ) and low metallicities ( i.e. , @xmath58 @xmath10.1  0.01 @xmath59 ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "dlas are also known to have lower nitrogen abundance relative to @xmath10-elements , compared to solar abundance pattern ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dlas provide plentiful information on the physical condition in gas clouds in the ancient universe that can never be traced by stellar objects .",
    "however , so far dla absorbers have not been identified clearly , especially at higher redshift , although at least elliptical galaxies are probably ruled out @xcite .",
    "thus , it is quite helpful to find local counterparts of those systems and study their properties in detail .",
    "with respect to column density ,",
    "the mb absorbers toward pks  0312@xmath2770 , whose total column density is just below the criterion to be classified as a dla system , could be analogs of high-@xmath16 dla systems . however , their nitrogen abundance relative to @xmath10-elements ( e.g. , [ n / si ] ) tend to be small and positioned at the lowest end of the [ n / si ] distribution of dla systems in figure  11 .",
    "particularly , the nitrogen abundance of the @xmath0 = 236 cloud is very small compared to that expected for dla systems and blue compact galaxies of a similar metallicity .",
    "the origin of this difference should be understood before using the mb absorbers as local counterparts of high-@xmath16 dla systems .",
    "the nitrogen deficiency may be linked to the synthesis process .",
    "it is already known that nitrogen is produced by low and intermediate mass stars ( lims ; @xmath92 @xmath57 8) , while @xmath10-elements are produced by massive stars . for dla systems with low nitrogen (",
    "hereafter , low nitrogen dlas : lndlas ) , there have been two possible scenarios presented ( @xcite and references therein ) : i.e. , ( i ) they are in early production stages of nitrogen released from lims ( delay scenario , @xcite ) , and ( ii ) they have an intrinsically flattened or truncated initial mass function ( imf ) with fewer lims ( reduction scenario , @xcite ) .",
    "however , as summarized in @xcite , neither scenario can explain the nitrogen deficiency of lndlas perfectly ; the former can not reproduce a possible bimodality of [ n/@xmath10 ] distribution of dlas @xcite , while the latter produces too much iron compared with the observed amount @xcite .",
    "thus , we have not yet identified the origin of the nitrogen deficiency .",
    "nonetheless , it is likely that the production history of nitrogen is not the same between the smc and the mb .",
    "the imf of a stellar association ngc  602 in the smc ( a single power - law with a slope of @xmath94 @xmath1@xmath95 for @xmath92 = 1  45 ; @xcite ) is quite similar to the imf in the solar neighborhood ( @xmath94 @xmath1@xmath96 for @xmath92 = 0.4  10 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the abundance patterns of the mw and the smc are expected to be similar , while they can be different from that of the mb , whose imf is not necessarily the same .",
    "the mb probably has a local star forming history independent of the nearby star forming regions ( i.e. , the lmc and the smc ) , which is consistent with the observed results that the young stars in the mb are not old enough to have escaped from the smc based on their peculiar motions .",
    "if the mb absorbers are indeed local counterparts of high-@xmath16 dlas , our results would have interesting implications : ( i ) dla systems along our sight - lines to the background quasars do not necessarily represent global properties of absorbing structures , and ( ii ) the large scatter of metallicity and [ n/@xmath10 ] values could be due to the internal gradient of each dla absorber , and they are different from place to place along different sight - lines go through .",
    "for example , we would under - estimate the global metallicity ( and nitrogen abundance ) of the magellanic clouds if our line of sight went through only the mb .",
    "moreover , there might be metallicity gradient in the mb itself ; higher in the smc wing than in the remaining parts of the mb ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as for dlas , @xcite and @xcite already suggested that there could be a metallicity gradient as a function of a distance from the galactic center . @xcite and @xcite also proposed that the dla region is sampling a lower metallicity than the star - forming regions .",
    "thus , high-@xmath16 dla systems also may have complex internal structures like the magellanic clouds and their neighborhood .",
