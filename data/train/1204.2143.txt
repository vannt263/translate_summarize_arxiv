    "the @xmath17-factor calculated from the gate - voltage dependent effective level splitting - which mimics the experimental @xmath1-factor extraction from bias spectroscopy - we find sizable renormalization of its magnitude while the angular dependence is only mildly affected . on the other hand , the @xmath16-factor extracted from the coulomb blockade peak splitting of the linear conductance appears to be almost interaction independent .",
    "the considered asymmetric parameter set shows qualitatively similar results .",
