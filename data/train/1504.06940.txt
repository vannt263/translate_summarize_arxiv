    "in 2010 , a precision measurement @xcite of the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen by using pulsed laser spectroscopy was performed and gave @xmath6 mev . combing this precise value with the theoretical calculation @xcite",
    "@xmath7 the values of the proton radius is extracted as @xmath8 fm @xcite . in 2013 ,",
    "the further precise measurements of @xmath9 transition frequencies of muonic hydrogen @xcite gave the magnetic radius of proton @xmath10 fm and the charge radius @xmath11 fm which are not significantly different from the value given by ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , based on the hydrogen data or the @xmath12 scattering data , codata-2010 gave @xmath13 fm @xcite , which is much larger than the results by the muonic hydrogen s lamb - shift .",
    "and if this value of proton radius is used , the theoretical prediction for the lambs shift of muonic hydrogen gives @xcite @xmath14 which deviates from the experimental lamb shift of muonic hypdrogen about @xmath15 mev .",
    "many theoretical calculations @xcite , data analysis @xcite and possible new mechanisms such as the three body physics @xcite , the new exotic particles interactions @xcite , the higher - order contribution of the finite size @xcite _ etc_. , have been discussed to try to understand such discrepancy . and also",
    "new experiment of @xmath12 scattering is proposed in jlab @xcite . combining all these current analysis , briefly ,",
    "the radius of proton is still not well understood .    for the muonic hydrogen , the energy transition of @xmath16 and @xmath17 usually are expressed as @xmath18 in the literature , the contributions of the four terms are usually calculated by the perturbative theory . using the quasipotential method in quantum electrodynamics @xcite ,",
    "the contributions to the four terms can be expressed as @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 mev by the first order perturbative theory ( @xmath0pt ) and @xmath22 mev by the second order perturbative theory ) , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 mev ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 mev ) are the energy shifts due to the one - loop vacuum polarization , two - loop vacuum polarization and the sum of self - energy and muonic - vacuum polarization , correspondingly , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 mev ) is the energy shift due to all further qed corrections , and the last two terms in @xmath29 are relevant radius - dependent contributions@xcite , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 mev ) , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 mev ) and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 mev ) are the fermi energies , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 mev ) , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 mev ) and @xmath40 ( @xmath41 mev ) are the contributions from the anomalous magnetic moment of muon , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the other contributions@xcite .",
    "some of the above perturbative results have been checked by the nonperturbative numerical ( npnum ) calculations , for example within the framework of the multiconfiguration dirac - fock ( mcdf ) method in @xcite and shotting - like method using quad - precision fortran in @xcite . in this work , by using the mathematica , we present another high precise npnum calculations ( much more precise than the quad - precision ) on the energy shifts @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 with considering the effects from the proton structure . and as a comparison , also the calculation of @xmath48 is presented .",
    "the leading order contribution to the fine and hyperfine structure of muonic hydrogen due to the proton structure is from the two photon exchange diagrams .",
    "since there is ir divergence in these diagrams and such ir divergence is not dependent on the proton structure ( only dependent on its charge ) , the one photon exchange diagram should be considered together in some way to cancel such ir divergence .",
    "this leads to the complexity in the discussion of the numerical calculation , so at present we take the effective potential from the one photon exchange diagram as an example to discuss the difference between the @xmath0pt calculation and the npnum calculation .",

    "the correction to the coulomb potential from this diagram was discussed in the recent work @xcite , and in this work , we discuss its corrections to the fine and hypefine breit potential by a precise numerical method . by using the quasipotential method the breit potential can be expressed as @xcite .",
