    "graphene @xcite , a two - dimensional crystal with a honeycomb array of carbon atoms , has been one of the most hot topics in condensed matter physics in this decade .",
    "the most prominent feature of graphene is existence of massless dirac fermions , or dirac cones at the fermi energy . in general ,",
    "not limited to graphene , dirac cones allow a lot of properties distinct from usual metals or semiconductors , such as unique responses to electronic and magnetic field @xcite , or characteristic edge states @xcite",
    ". one interesting subject of study is a manipulation of dirac cones .",
    "for instance , shifting the dirac cones in momentum space induces a gauge field without breaking the time reversal symmetry @xcite . by inducing a mass of dirac cones ( gap opening )",
    ", we have a chance to observe topologically nontrivial phases .",
    "for instance , by appropriately breaking the time reversal symmetry , graphene can go into a quantum hall state without external magnetic field @xcite . or ,",
    "if the spin degrees of freedom and the spin  orbit coupling are explicitly taken account of , graphene becomes a time reversal invariant @xmath0 topological insulator @xcite .",
    "one direction of recent developments in dirac and topological systems is exporting the concept to systems other than conventional solid materials .",
    "for instance , manipulation of dirac cones is experimentally realized in an optical lattice cold atoms @xcite .",
    "the other example is electromagnetic field in a photonic crystal , which is governed by the classical maxwell equation . as for triangular and honeycomb lattices",
    ", the dirac cones in photonic band are demonstrated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , topologically nontrivial phase is achieved in photonic crystals or a coupled resonator system @xcite . very recently , other classical systems , i.e. , mechanical systems obeying the newton s equation of motion are also discussed in the context of dirac cones or topological edge states @xcite .",
    "one great advantage of these kinds of artificial systems is their controllability , which enables us to access parameter region unreachable in solids .",
    "we can easily realize phenomena that are difficult in solids such as merging of dirac cones @xcite .    in this paper , a honeycomb spring - mass model @xcite",
    ", we dubbed it as mechanical graphene , is investigated as a typical mechanical system in which dirac physics plays a role .",
    "we propose a simple and feasible way , just stretching the system uniformly and isotropically , to manipulate dirac cones .",
    "the uniform stretch modifies tension of springs at equilibrium , which controls the relation between the transverse and longitudinal waves .",
    "then , the frequency spectrum varies as a function of the tension .",
    "as the tension grows from zero , the frequency band structure first looks like the one in @xmath1-orbital honeycomb optical lattice @xcite ( phase i ) , then becomes like the one in bilayer graphene with the trigonal warping @xcite ( phase ii ) . finally the spectrum is given by that of graphene ( phase iii ) , but with extra degeneracy .",
    "merging of the dirac cones is observed at the two critical points .",
    "this topological transition associated with the merging of the dirac cones is detected as a jump in the appropriately defined chern number @xcite , when the time reversal symmetry is broken by uniform rotation of the system .",
    "the change in the chern number is also observed by the propagation direction of the `` chiral edge modes '' @xcite . not only proposing a practical method for dirac cone manipulation",
    ", we also demonstrate the state - of - art idea of topological phenomena , symmetry protection , is at work in this system by focusing on edge states and boundary condition . without the time reversal symmetry breaking , in - gap edge states appear for the fixed boundary condition , while they do not appear for the free boundary condition . in the topological view point ,",
    "symmetry breaking at the edge is behind this contrast .",

    "the unit vectors @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the vectors connecting the nearest neighbor sites , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . ]    the model treated in this paper is composed of mass points , springs , and additional potential energy sources , where the mass points are aligned in the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice .",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . ]",
    "motion of the mass points is also restricted in the two dimensional space , i.e. , the out of plane motion is prohibited .",
    "parameters characterizing this model are mass of the mass points @xmath8 , a spring constant @xmath9 , distance between the nearest neighbor mass points @xmath10 , and natural length of the springs @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , there are some parameters to characterize additional potential energy other than the one from springs connecting the mass points .",
    "the mass @xmath8 is fixed to 1 for simplicity from now on .",
    "@xmath12 is not necessarily unity , but when it deviates from unity , each string gives finite force even in equilibrium , which means that we should make the system to avoid shrinkage as a whole .",
    "for instance , we need to support the system by appropriate choice of the boundary condition . or , the potential source other than the springs need to be added",
    ". as far as the shrinkage is prevented , the mass points are stable at the equilibrium position since the forces from three springs connected to one mass point cancel out .",
    "dynamical variables for this model is written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes a lattice point , and @xmath15 is a sublattice index . as we will see below",
    ", the model has commonality with the nearest neighbor tight - binding model of real graphene , but the major difference is that the mass point allows to oscillate in two directions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "there is also the sublattice degrees of freedom , which means that the frequency spectrum for this model has four bands",
    ".    for this model , elastic energy of the spring for a given pattern of mass point configuration has a special importance .",
    "we first see it for a pair of mass points , introducing parameters @xmath18 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . here , @xmath18 is a vector connecting two neighboring mass points in equilibrium . in this paper",
    ", we adopt an assumption that all springs have good linearity , i.e. , the energy of the spring @xmath19 is always written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the length of the spring at that moment , independent of the value of @xmath21 .",
    "then , up to the second order in @xmath22 , which is required to investigate harmonic oscillation around the equilibrium alignment , we have @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "summation over indices appearing as a pair is assumed ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this formula indicates that when @xmath27 , @xmath19 strongly depends on the angle between @xmath18 and @xmath28 , while when @xmath29 , @xmath19 is independent of the direction of @xmath28 . for @xmath27 ,",
    "no force is given by a spring if @xmath28 is normal to @xmath18 , since such a motion only leads to the rotation of the spring and does not increase the elastic energy in the lowest order approximation . on the other hand , for @xmath29",
    ", there is finite force even for @xmath30 , and then the motion with @xmath31 can increase the energy since there is a finite component of force normal to @xmath18 for such motion .",
    "in short , the value of @xmath32 controls a ratio of strength of the restoring force for @xmath33 and @xmath31 .",
    "in other words , it controls the relation between the longitudinal and the transverse wave modes .",
    "then the lagrangian of this system becomes @xmath34 with @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a position of the sublattice @xmath15 associated with the lattice point at @xmath14 , and @xmath37 .",
    "summation over @xmath38 means that we pick up pairs of the nearest neighbor mass points .",
    "the term @xmath39 represents a kinetic energy . the term @xmath40 is contributed from the potential energy other than the springs connecting the mass points , expanded in a series of @xmath41 up to the second order . for simplicity , we assume that this potential is isotropic and sublattice independent .",
    "the terms @xmath42 and @xmath43 come from the elastic energy of the springs .",
    "as far as the equilibrium is achieved for @xmath44 , the term @xmath43 is identically zero , and does not contribute to the equation of motion . assuming the periodic boundary condition and introducing @xmath45 as @xmath46 the lagrangian is rewritten as @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "here , @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 [ see fig .  [ fig1](c ) for the definitions of @xmath6 . ]",
    "now equation to be solved becomes @xmath52 we seek for the solution periodic in time by introducing a new dynamical variable @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "then , what we have to solve is @xmath55 and to have a nontrivial solution , we must have @xmath56=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : det}\\ ] ] practically , this is done by diagonalizing @xmath57 . in that sense , it is possible to map the problem to a quantum mechanical one , by regarding @xmath57 as a quantum hamiltonian .    here",
    ", we make a comment on the symmetry of @xmath57 . except the constant diagonal elements",
    ", @xmath57 has no term connecting a same kind of sublattice components .",
    "since the constant diagonal elements only add a constant contribution to @xmath58 , we say that @xmath57 has a `` chiral '' symmetry , since @xmath57 anticommute with @xmath59 if the constant diagonal part is subtracted .",
    "that is , @xmath60 satisfies @xmath61 in fermionic systems , the chiral symmetry plays important roles in various situations . for instance , it stabilizes dirac cones in 2d cases @xcite .",
    "now , the problem is quite similar to the phonon problem in graphene @xcite .",
    "however , what is essential in the following arguments is to control @xmath32 in a wide range , which is difficult to realize in actual graphene .",
    "furthermore , the effective model for graphene phonon does not respect the `` chiral symmetry '' , which plays essential role in considering the topological origin of the edge modes .",
    "this is because if the vibrational motion in graphene is modeled using a spring - mass model , it requires springs connecting the next nearest neighbor sites and more .",
    "lastly , our model neglects the motion in perpendicular to the plane of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "now , let us investigate dispersion relation of @xmath62 . before going to general values of @xmath32 , we consider two limits @xmath29 and @xmath27 . for @xmath29 , @xmath63 becomes @xmath64 then @xmath58 looks exactly like a dispersion relation of the nearest neighbor tight - binding model for graphene ( nn - graphene ) but with extra double degeneracy . in @xmath29 limit , there is no distinction between the longitudinal and transverse wave mode , and in this case , oscillation in @xmath16- and @xmath17-direction decouple , which leads to doubled nn - graphene dispersion . on the other hand for @xmath27",
    ", @xmath63 becomes @xmath65 with @xmath66 .",
    "then , as shown in ref .  , the second and third bands of @xmath58 , dispersion is same as nn - graphene , but the first and the fourth bands are exactly flat and stick to the top and bottom of the other bands .",
    "interestingly , @xmath57 at @xmath27 is essentially same as the hamiltonian of @xmath1-orbital honeycomb optical lattice model introduced in ref .  .",
    "now , we follow the evolution of the dispersion relation as @xmath32 changes from 1 to 0 . in the following , we always scale the spring constant @xmath9 as @xmath67 with @xmath68 , in order to make the total band width of the frequency dispersion constant .",
    "this scaling also makes the frequency of the dirac point constant . the dispersion relation for @xmath69",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "it is similar to the one for @xmath27 and the dirac cone is still there at the k - point ( and k-point ) , but the first and the fourth bands gains finite dispersion and they are no longer flat . at @xmath70 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , the gap at the m - point in between the second and the third bands closes . in the vicinity of the m - point , the dispersion is linear in @xmath71-m direction but quadratic in m - k direction .",
    "such a linear vs quadratic dispersion relation is often characteristic for merging of a pair of dirac cones @xcite . in fact , soon after @xmath32 becomes less than 2/3 , there appear two new dirac cones , other than those at the k- and k- points , on m - k lines .",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) . ] due to the three fold rotational symmetry , there appear six new dirac cones in the whole brillouin zone in total .",
    "the new dirac cones move from the m - point to the k - point as @xmath32 approaches to zero . for @xmath72 , especially for small @xmath32 where the positions of the new dirac cones get close to the k- and k-points , the dispersion relation looks like the one for bilayer graphene with the trigonal warping @xcite . finally , at @xmath29 , the new dirac cones are absorbed to the originally existing dirac cones at the k- and k-points , and the dispersion becomes degenerated nn - graphene dispersion .",
    "the transition at @xmath70 that is associated with the dirac cone merging can be characterized by the `` herring number '' . for electronic systems ,",
    "the herring number is defined as @xcite @xmath73,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is spatial dimension , @xmath75s are the time reversal invariant momenta , and @xmath76 is the number of occupied states with parity eigenvalue @xmath77 at @xmath75 .",
    "this number is also used by fu and kane to obtain @xmath0 topological number of the inversion symmetric topological insulator with the spin  orbit coupling , or to check the existence of dirac cones without the spin ",
    "orbit coupling @xcite . for 2d cases , parity of @xmath78 determines the parity of the number of dirac cones in half of the brillouin zone as explained below . in ref .",
    ", in order to detect dirac cones in generic 2d systems , we have used the berry phase defined as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are two momenta in independent directions , and @xmath82 is a bloch wave function @xcite .",
    "when the system respects both of the time reversal and spatial inversion symmetry , @xmath83 is quantized into @xmath84 or @xmath85 for the spinless case @xcite .",
    "as far as the quantization is kept , @xmath83 has to show a jump when it changes as a function of @xmath80 , but the jump should be associated with a singularity of the band structure that is nothing more than a dirac cone . having this in mind , we can say that if @xmath86 , odd number of dirac cones exist in the region @xmath87 , i.e. , half of the brillouin zone , while if @xmath88 , the number of dirac cones in the half brillouin zone is even . on the other hand",
    ", the inversion symmetry gives us a relation @xcite @xmath89 therefore , the herring number has an ability to detect the number of dirac cones .",
    "this idea has been applied to the 2d organic dirac fermion systems @xcite .",
    "now , we are handling a classical mechanical system , not an electronic system , but the herring number is still useful .",
    "we have seen that the number of dirac points in the half brillouin zone is odd ( one ) in @xmath90 and even ( four ) in @xmath72 .",
    "this difference should be captured by the herring number . in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a)-[fig2](d ) , the eigenvalues of the inversion operator @xmath91 , which is defined as @xmath92 at the m - point are indicated for each band .",
    "we notice that at the transition , @xmath70 , the positive and negative eigenvalues at the m - point are interchanged .",
    "since there are three distinct m - points in the brillouin zone , this interchange results in the parity change of the herring number .",
    "note that herring originally considers only three - dimensional cases , and in his paper , @xmath78 is derived to detect the number of degeneracy loops in 3d brillouin zone , instead of dirac cones .     with the fixed boundary condition .",

    "then , we obtain the equation similar to eq .  , but with larger number of components in the matrices and vectors .",
    "in the following , we concentrate on the zigzag edge .",
    "in addition , we use the fixed boundary condition , that is , the mass points at the boundary are connected to the springs that are fixed to the wall , instead of simply removing the springs at the boundary .",
    "[ see figs .",
    "[ fig4](b ) and [ fig4](c ) . ]",
    "importance of the boundary condition is discussed later .",
    "the obtained frequency spectra for several values of @xmath32 as functions of @xmath80 , momentum parallel to the edge , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a)-[fig3](d ) . for @xmath69 , as in the case of @xmath27@xcite , we observe in - gap edge modes near @xmath94 .",
    "the edge modes forms a flat band , since the `` chiral symmetry '' is preserved in this case . at @xmath29 ,",
    "the system exactly inherits the property of nn - graphene .",
    "for instance , the edge modes are found near @xmath95 instead of @xmath94 found for @xmath90 . in short ,",
    "the position of the edge modes in the edge brillouin zone is switched from near @xmath94 to @xmath95 as @xmath32 changes from @xmath96 to @xmath84 .",
    "we observe that the new dirac cones emerged from the m - points bring new edge modes near @xmath95 and take away the originally existing edge modes near @xmath94 .",
    "again , note that our model does not necessary leads to the results exactly same as the case of the actual graphene phonon problems @xcite .    .",
    "( b , c ) schematic pictures of the ( b ) fixed and ( c ) free boundary conditions . ]        to see the importance of the boundary condition , @xmath62 for @xmath27 obtained with the free boundary condition , where the springs at the boundary are simply removed , is shown in fig .",
    "note that @xmath97 does not go well with the free boundary condition since the finite tension results in the deformation of the equilibrium lattice as the springs at the boundary becomes absent .",
    "then , we have to take the deformation into account , but instead of doing that , we focus on @xmath27 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows that there is no edge mode found as in - gap states .",
    "this difference between the two boundary conditions is deeply related to symmetry protection of topological phases , which is one of the most important concept in modern study of topological phenomena . in the real graphene case",
    ", it is possible to think a topological origin of the edge modes @xcite .",
    "for that , the chiral symmetry plays an important role in defining the bulk topological number , the quantized berry phase , and protecting in - gap edge states . for the fixed boundary condition , the `` chiral symmetry '' , eq .  ,",
    "is preserved even after the boundary is introduced , since the springs connected to the mass points at the boundary is left . on the other hand , the free boundary condition does not respects the `` chiral symmetry '' since the absence of the springs at the boundary leads to the _ nonuniform _ diagonal elements in @xmath98 .",
    "this indicates that even the bulk topological property is same , the topological edge states are not necessarily preserved for the free boundary condition , in contrast to the fixed boundary condition , which demonstrates the manifestation of the symmetry protection .",
    "now , we know that the edge modes for @xmath99 and @xmath100 has different momenta along the edge",
    ". then , the oscillation pattern in the real space should look different . in order to convince this expectation ,",
    "we perform a calculation using a rectangular system with long zigzag edges and short armchair edges .",
    "this calculation also gives a result to the situation that is easily accessed in experiment . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the typical eigenmodes whose frequency is close to @xmath101 , a frequency of the bulk dirac points , is shown for @xmath102 and @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath27 , the mass points at the boundary basically oscillate in phase with the neighboring mass points on the edge with large wave length background , reflecting the fact that the edge modes are existing near @xmath94 in the momentum space . on the other hand , for @xmath102 , the neighboring mass points on the edge tend to oscillate anti - phase , reflecting the edge mode position in the momentum space . for @xmath27 , the mass points at the boundary oscillate approximately normal to the boundary , while for @xmath102 , oscillation in parallel to the boundary is also allowed . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , only the typical eigenmodes are shown , but we have confirmed that the above statements are basically valid for the mode near @xmath103 .",
    "thus , the oscillation pattern of the eigenmode localized at the boundary can be used to detect the phase transition associated with the dirac cone merging .",
    "this is important since the observation of the edge mode with finite size system may be much easier than measuring the dispersion relation itself in detail .",
    "lastly , we consider effects of rotation , which induces time reversal symmetry breaking . uniform rotation as a whole brings two new terms in the lagrangian , one is the centrifugal force and the other is the coriolis force . for simplicity , the centrifugal force is neglected .",
    "the centrifugal force is second order in the angular frequency of the rotation @xmath104 , while the coriolis force is first order in @xmath104 , and the second order term can be neglected in the situation that @xmath104 is regarded as a small quantity .",

    "instead , it is possible to obtain allowed @xmath62 by explicitly evaluating the determinant analytically , and solving a quartic equation of @xmath58 .",
    "when @xmath107 is large , the equation to be solved approximately becomes @xmath108=0,\\ ] ] and diagonalization of @xmath109 is sufficient to obtain @xmath62 .",

    "eventually , the extra dirac cones are absorbed to the dirac cones at the k- and k-points , and the dispersion is characterized by doubly degenerated dirac cones in the strong tension limit . the singular bulk dispersion is reflected in the edge spectrum , which is confirmed by a calculation with the ribbon geometry and the fixed boundary condition .",
    "corresponding to the generation and merging of the bulk dirac cones , the position of the edge states in the momentum space changes , and this change can be detected by observing the real space pattern of the oscillation of the edge modes .",
    "on the other hand , the free boundary condition gives no edge modes . in the topological viewpoint , absence of the edge mode for the free boundary condition is explained by breaking of the `` chiral symmetry '' at the edge .",
    "these observation forms a good example of the bulk  edge correspondence .",
    "lastly , coriolis force is introduced to discuss the time reversal symmetry breaking . then , generation and merging of the dirac cones found without coriolis force appear as a jump in the chern number , which is defined regarding the vector of normal modes as bloch wave functions . furthermore , it is demonstrated that when the sign of the chern number is flipped , then the propagation direction of the chiral edge modes is really flipped .",
    "importantly , flip in the propagation direction is caused by only controlling the tension at equilibrium , which keeps the symmetry of the system intact .",
    "that is , the system looks same , but still the edge modes propagate in the opposite directions .",
