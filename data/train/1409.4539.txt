    "the enhancement is essentially due to the then dominant bottom contribution .",
    "next , without any cronin effect , we compare the result of the hf diffusion with and without applying rrm as a hadronization mechanism . this may serve as a lower estimate of the strong - coupling effects around the pseudo - critical region . with neither rrm nor cronin , a weak maximum of the @xmath5 above 1 develops around @xmath46@xmath261gev ( black dashed line ) , reflecting the well - known  flow bump \" for heavy particles as a consequence of the collectively expanding medium . upon inclusion of rrm ( no cronin ; green dash - dotted line ) , the net addition of momenta from light quarks from the thermalized medium generates a much more pronounced  flow bump \" , shifted to a slightly larger @xmath46@xmath261.5gev , with a broader structure and a maximum value of @xmath661.8 ; the onset of suppression shifts up to above @xmath74@xmath262.5gev .",

    "our analysis is not incompatible with the formation of a qcd medium in au+au collisions at 62.4gev , whose strong coupling around the pseudo - critical region imparts substantial collectivity on hf particles through their nonperturbative interactions .",
    "however , more precise data would allow for much more sensitive tests of the pertinent structures emerging from our calculations .",

    "<S> the heavy - flavor coupling to the medium is strongest in the pseudo - critical region , it is of interest to test its consequences at lower collision energies where the sensitivity to this region should be enhanced relative to the hotter ( early ) fireball temperatures reached at top rhic and lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the suppression and flow pattern of the non - photonic electrons from heavy - flavor decays at 62.4gev emerges from an intricate interplay of thermalization and initial - state effects , in particular a cronin enhancement which is known to become more pronounced toward lower collision energies . </S>"
