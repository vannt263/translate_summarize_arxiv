    "holography has now been widely accepted as one of the fundamental properties of relativistic gravitational theories , largely due to the discovery of ads / cft duality @xcite . in its preliminary form ,",
    "holographic principle was originally proposed by t hooft @xcite and susskind @xcite respectively , which simply states that the microscopic degrees of freedom of a black hole reside solely on its horizon surface . in ads",
    "/ cft , however , the holographic surface is promoted to the boundary at conformal infinity .",
    "certainly this promotion has important significance and physical consequences .",
    "since the boundary at conformal infinity for asymptotically ads spacetime is a timelike hypersurface , the dual theory on the boundary behaves as a field theory defined on a co - dimension one spacetime . in particular , it is a theory sitting at the fixed point of the renormalization group , i.e. a conformal field theory .",
    "one can use the holographic duality to study the properties of the dual theory by looking at the corresponding features in the bulk or vice versa .    despite its great success",
    ", one should keep in mind that ads / cft is not the full story for holography .",
    "the study of holographic properties of non - asymptotically ads spacetimes have not been promoted to the same level of depth .",
    "one reason for this lies in that , for non - asymptotically ads spacetimes , the boundary at conformal infinity is usually not a timelike hypersurface and hence it is difficult to define the dual theory as a normal field theory . to this end let us mention that for asymptotically flat spacetimes , the conformal infinity is always lightlike , which is very different from a timelike hypersurface .",
    "there are other reasons , for instance , even if one can manage to define a dual theory , it will be usually nonlocal @xcite and lacks physical interests .    even though there are various difficulties while considering the holographic properties of non - asymptotically ads spacetimes , they can never be enough to serve as a mind stopper .",
    "various attempts have been practiced towards this problem @xcite . among them",
    ", the holographic entanglement entropy ( hee ) seems to be particularly suitable for tackling this problem .",
    "roughly speaking , the hee is a shortcut for calculating the entanglement entropy of a subsystem in the dual theory . when the bulk theory is einstein gravity , ryu and takayanagi conjectured that the entanglement entropy of a subsystem on the boundary is identical to the area ( divided by @xmath0 ) of a minimal surface which takes the entanglement surface as its own boundary @xcite .",
    "this conjecture has been proven in @xcite , and also generalized to time - dependent background @xcite and higher derivative gravity @xcite .    since rt formula involves the minimal surface , it is important to analyze such minimal surfaces in various asymptotically ads spacetime with black hole in the bulk or time - dependent background , for instance in @xcite .",
    "extremal surfaces are also analyzed in de sitter spacetime @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall take ryu - takayanagi conjecture as the definition of hee in asymptotically flat spacetimes @xcite . more concretely",
    ", we shall study the hee in four dimensional schwarzschild and reisner - nordstrm ( rn ) spacetimes and analyze its dependence on various impacting parameters . to avoid getting only divergent results",
    ", we do not put the boundary at conformal infinity .",
    "instead , we take the boundary at some finite radial position which is either very far from the black hole horizon or is very close to the horizon .",
    "such boundary hypersurfaces are all timelike , and therefore there leaves room for defining normal dual field theories on such hypersurfaces",
    ". however , remember that the boundary hypersurfaces we take are not sitting at the renormalization group fixed point , so even there exist normal dual field theories , these will not be conformal .",
    "such theories may just be some off critical theories .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we study the hee in schwarzschild and rn spacetimes with far boundaries .",
    "it will be shown that the behavior of the hee for both spacetimes are quite similar .",
    "the difference begins to show up only at the second order in the perturbative expansion , which is negligibly small . in section 3",
    ", we study the same problem but with the far boundaries replaced by near horizon ones .",
    "the hee behaves differently for the case of extremal rn spacetime in contrast to the cases of schwarzschild and non - extremal rn spacetimes .",
    "the hees in all cases will be calculated up to the second order in the perturbative expansion and will be cross checked by numerical procedures . in the last section , section 4 ,",
    "we summarize some of the interesting results obtained in this paper .",
    "in this section , we shall study the hee in schwarzschild and rn spacetimes with the dual theory defined on a boundary located at large but finite radial coordinate @xmath1 .",
    "the bulk theory is assumed to be einstein gravity and the spacetime metric takes the well known form @xmath2 when both of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 equal to zero , the metric becomes that of the minkowski spacetime .",
    "when @xmath5 but @xmath6 , the metric corresponds to schwarzschild spacetime . and",
    "when both @xmath4 and @xmath3 are nonzero , the metric corresponds to rn spacetime . with either @xmath5 or both @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "are nonzero , we can think of the contributions of the terms involving @xmath3 and/or @xmath4 as perturbations at large enough radial distances .",
    "in this section , we take the boundary hypersurface at @xmath1 with @xmath7 very large but still finite .",
    "the entanglement surface will be taken to be a circle characterized by @xmath8 , and the minimal surface which takes the entanglement surface as its boundary can be described by the radial coordinate @xmath9 as a function of @xmath10 , i.e. @xmath11 , which is to be determined via the minimization of the area function = 2_0^_0r , [ area ] with the boundary condition @xmath12 .",
    "once the above variational problem is solved , the hee will be given by the ryu - takayanagi formula s=. [ rt ]    first let us consider the hee in the minkowski background . in this case , we have @xmath13 and the minimal surface is simply a flat disk with equation @xmath14 .",
    "this surface has area @xmath15 , hence the hee is @xcite [ leadingee ] s_0==.    now let us return to the case with generic @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for simplicity",
    "we denote @xmath16 .",
    "then the area formula can be rewritten as [ lag1 ] = _",
    "l = 2_x_0 ^ 1 x r , where @xmath17 and the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath18 .",

    "the equation is highly nonlinear . in order to get a nontrivial solution with nonzero @xmath3 and @xmath4 ,",

    "for schwarzschild spacetime , @xmath27 . for rn spacetime , @xmath28 ,",
    "wherein @xmath29 represents a non - extremal black hole spacetime , @xmath30 represents an extremal spacetime , and @xmath31 corresponds to a spacetime with a naked singularity .    in the following ,",
    "we shall use the above expansion to get approximate solutions to the equation up to the second order in @xmath23 and evaluate the corresponding modifications to the hee .",
    "similar procedures have been applied in @xcite wherein the metric perturbation of hee in global ads coordinate is studied , and also in @xcite , where the time dependence of holographic entanglement complexity is analyzed .",
    "to the first order in @xmath23 , eq . becomes @xmath32 with @xmath33 provided as a known function , eq .",
    "is a second order linear inhomogeneous differential equation in @xmath34 .",
    "it is known that for generic second order linear inhomogeneous differential equations of the form r_1+p(x)r_1+q(x)r_1=g(x ) , the general solution can be written as r_1(x)=c_1u_1(x)+c_2u_2(x)+^xdy , [ gensol ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are solutions for the homogeneous equation r_1+p(x)r_1+q(x)r_1=0 , and @xmath37 is the wronskian of the solutions @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    for eq.([eq1 ] ) , we can easily get [ so1 ] u_1(x)= ,  u_2= , and hence w(x)=. inserting @xmath38 and g(x)= into , we get @xmath39 since @xmath40 $ ] , the terms containing @xmath41 must be cancelled to avoid divergence , which is used to determine @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 can be fixed by the boundary condition @xmath44 , which results in c_1=r_. finally the first order contribution to @xmath19 is r_1(x)=. notice that @xmath45 given above diverges when @xmath46 ( i.e. @xmath47 ) , therefore it is necessary to restrict @xmath48 , so that @xmath46 can never be approached .",
    "this is a limitation of the perturbative expansion in the case of far boundaries .",
    "the same limitation also appears in the case of ads background @xcite .    in order to evaluate the first order modification to the hee ,",
    "let us expand the integrand @xmath49 in ( [ lag1 ] ) to the first order in @xmath23 , [ sol1_fi ] l = l_0+l_1 + , so that becomes = _ 0+_1 + , with @xmath50\\nonumber\\\\ & = 2\\pi m(1-x_0)^2 r_\\infty.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is not surprising that replacing @xmath51 with @xmath52 in would yield the hee at the background level .",
    "similarly , replacing @xmath51 with @xmath53 in yields the first order modification to the hee , s_1 = r_. since we assume @xmath7 to be very large and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , we can safely regard @xmath56 to be a `` small '' modification to @xmath57 .",
    "an important point to observe is that ss - s_0 s_1 = m , i.e. the small modification to the hee is proportional to the black hole mass .",
    "this behavior is similar to the case of hee associated with black holes in ads backgrounds @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the result @xmath58 is known as the first law of hee .",
    "another point to observe lies in that @xmath56 is independent of the charge @xmath4 , so that it can not distinguish the cases of schwarzschild and rn black holes .",
    "this is also not surprising because we are now considering the far boundaries , and the charge term in plays as the second order modification in the far end . to observe the contribution of the charge parameter",
    ", we have to move on to the second order .      at the second order , eq .",
    "takes the form @xmath59 where the homogeneous part takes the same form as that of the first order equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , thus the solutions of the homogeneous equation remain unchanged .",
    "the inhomogeneous term @xmath60 takes the value g_2(x)=. the solution of eq .",
    "can be written as r_2(x)=c_3 u_1(x)+c_4 u_2(x)+u(x ) , where @xmath61 are given in , and @xmath62 similar to the case discussed in the previous subsection , the integration constant @xmath63 can be determined by the cancellation of the term involving @xmath41 , and the boundary condition @xmath64 fixes @xmath65 , @xmath66,\\\\ c_4&=-\\frac{r_\\infty^2(\\xi^2 + 9)}{2z_0}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus we get the final expression for @xmath67 , r_2(x)=.    to obtain the second order modification to the hee , we need to expand the area @xmath51 and the integrand @xmath49 in up to the second order , @xmath68 omitting the very complicated expression for @xmath69 , we present directly the final result for @xmath70 : @xmath71m^2 + \\left[1-x_0 ^ 2 + 2\\log x_0\\right ] q^2\\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be seen explicitly that the charge begins to contribute at this order , but since @xmath72 , such contribution is always negligibly small . as a consequence , the first law for the hee s = s - s_0 m holds very well even if we calculate @xmath73 up to the second order .",
    "the study of hee with entangling surface located on the far boundary indicates that there is no significant difference between the cases of schwarzschild and rn spacetimes .",
    "this is of course just an illusion stemming from the particular choice of boundary at large @xmath7 . in this section , we shall study the opposite choice , i.e. near horizon boundaries . for such boundaries , the differences between the hees for schwarzschild , non - extremal rn and extremal rn spacetimes will become more transparent .",
    "first we consider the case of schwarzschild spacetime by setting @xmath6 in . in the near horizon limit ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce a new radial coordinate = , ( r_+=2 m ) after which the metric on the constant @xmath74 hypersurface becomes s^2=4g()^2 + g()^2(^2+^2 ^ 2 ) , where @xmath75 . in this new coordinate , the black hole event horizon",
    "is located at @xmath76 .",
    "now let us take a near horizon boundary at @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "once again , the one dimensional circle characterized by @xmath8 is taken as the entangling surface . the two dimensional minimal surface which takes the above circle as its boundary possesses an induced metric ^2=^2 + [ g()]^2 ^ 2 , where @xmath79 is to be determined by minimizing the surface area [ area ] = _",
    "x_0 ^ 1 x l = 2_x_0 ^ 1 x g()^1/2 , notice that we have made a coordinate change @xmath80 in eq .",
    "just like in the last subsection , and the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "the variation of eq.([area ] ) yields [ eomsch ] 2g(x^2 - 1)+8x(1-x^2)^3 + 5(1-x^2)^2 + 4 g x+g=0 .",
    "direct analytical solution to seems to be very difficult to find .",
    "therefore , we would like to find the minimal surface perturbatively following a similar procedure as we have done in the case of far boundaries .    by observing eq.([area ] ) , one sees that any surface anchored on the circle at @xmath81 and extended into the bulk with @xmath82 will have an area greater than that of the surface lies along @xmath77 with the same boundary . in other words , if there exists a minimal surface anchored on the above circle , it must lie in the region @xmath83 .",
    "thus the expansion of @xmath84 must start from the first order in @xmath23 , [ exprho ] ( x)=_1(x)+_2(x)^2 + , and the boundary condition @xmath85 becomes _",
    "1(x_0 ) = , _",
    "2(x_0 ) = 0 .",
    "[ bdry ]    substituting eq.([exprho ] ) into and expanding to the first order in @xmath23 , one gets ( x^2 - 1)_1 + 2x_1+_1=0 .",
    "[ legdr ] this is a special case of the legendre equation .",
    "the solution which is regular at @xmath86 and satisfies the boundary condition reads _ 1(x)=c_1 p_(x ) ,  = -^-/3 ,  c_1= , where @xmath87 is the legendre polynomial of the first kind . expanding to the second order in @xmath23 , the equation for @xmath88 follows , (",
    "x^2 - 1)_2 + 2x_2+_2=0 .",
    "this equation takes the same form as .",
    "thus the solution can be written as ( x)=c_2p_(x ) ,  = -^-/3 , and the boundary condition @xmath89 requires @xmath90 , which sets @xmath91 .    inserting eq.([exprho ] ) into the integrand @xmath49 in",
    ", we get l=2r_+^2 + 4r_+[(1-x^2)_1 ^ 2+_1 ^ 2]^2 + . substituting back into and",
    "expand @xmath51 accordingly , = _",

    "x_0 ^ 1 x.     versus @xmath93 , in units of @xmath94    the last integration can not be worked out analytically , however it is easy to get the numerical result .",
    "it turns out that for all @xmath95 , @xmath96 is finite and is less than 1 in units of @xmath97 .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] gives the plot of @xmath98 versus @xmath93 .",
    "since @xmath97 is roughly @xmath99 , we can see that the hee associated with schwarzschild spacetime with a near horizon boundary is almost precisely given by the zeroth order contribution .",
    "in particular , the hee equals the beckenstein - hawking entropy for the black hole when @xmath100 , i.e. @xmath101 .",
    "let us remark that there is no problem of divergence in the case of near horizon boundaries .",

    "we have shown that there is an extra term which is proportional to @xmath141 for the rn case .",

    "* also in the near horizon case , the hee for extremal and non - extremal rn spacetime behave quite differently .",
    "for the non - extremal case , the minimal surface anchored on the entangling surface on the boundary bends inwards , and hence the hee is smaller than the area of the subsystem on the boundary divided by @xmath0 . however , for the extremal case , the minimal surface is completely immersed inside the boundary , up to the second order in the perturbative expansion .",

    "<S> the holographic entanglement entropies ( hee ) associated with four dimensional schwarzschild and reisner - nordstrm spacetimes are investigated . unlike the cases of asymptotically ads spacetimes for which the boundaries are always taken at ( timelike ) conformal infinities , we take the boundaries at either large but finite radial coordinate ( far boundary ) or very close to the black hole event horizons ( near horizon boundary ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for such choices is that such boundaries are similar to the conformal infinity of ads spacetime in that they are all timelike , so that there may be some hope to define dual systems with ordinary time evolution on such boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that , in the case of far boundaries , the leading order contribution to the hees come from the background minkowski spacetime , however , the next to leading order contribution which arises from the presence of the black holes is always proportional to the black hole mass , which constitutes a version of the first law of the hee for asymptotically flat spacetimes , and the higher order contributions are always negligibly small . in the case of near horizon boundaries , </S>",
    "<S> the leading order contribution to the hee is always proportional to the area of the black hole event horizon , and the case of extremal rn black hole is distinguished from the cases of non - extremal black holes in that the minimal surface defining the hee is completely immersed inside the boundary up to the second order in the perturbative expansion . </S>"
