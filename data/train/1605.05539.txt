    "kelvin probe force microscopy ( kpfm ) is an advanced atomic force microscope ( afm ) method that enables the study of electrical properties of a sample with high lateral resolution . for semiconductor samples ,",
    "these properties include the dopant density , density of surface states , surface charge density , band bending and the work function @xcite . in combination with sample illumination techniques , properties such as the band gap , carrier diffusion length , and recombination rate",
    "can be obtained @xcite .",
    "the importance of kpfm is reflected in its application in a broad range of popular material science topics , such as new photovoltaic materials @xcite , two - dimensional materials @xcite , nanowires @xcite , topological insulators @xcite , plasmonic structures @xcite , and photocatalytic systems @xcite .",
    "reviews of kpfm and its applications can , e.g. , be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    like the classic vibrating kelvin probe",
    ", the quantity measured with kpfm is generally interpreted as the contact potential difference ( cpd ) @xcite . in the case of semiconductors",
    ", the situation is complicated by the possibility of band banding near the surface and the possible presence of surface charges .",
    "application of the cpd interpretation therefore requires careful consideration of these effects on the work function @xcite . however , baumgart , helm , and schmidt @xcite proposed an alternative interpretation for kpfm on semiconductors , which we will refer to as the bhs interpretation .",
    "as we show below , the cpd and bhs interpretations are significantly different .",
    "hence , it is important to determine what the differences between these two interpretations are , and to what extent they are valid @xcite .",
    "this is the main purpose of this work .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the theory section",
    ", we introduce the principles of kelvin probe measurements , describe the cpd and bhs predictions for _ pn_-junctions , and give the relevant expressions for the semiconductor modeling . in the methods sections we describe the computational and experimental details . finally , in the results and discussion section we explore the general differences between the bhs and cpd interpretations and test them against experimental kpfm results .",
    "in kpfm , an afm probe and sample are electrically connected through a voltage source that applies an oscillating potential @xmath0 .",
    "this causes an oscillation of the electrostatic force per unit area at frequency @xmath1 with amplitude @xmath2 , which is called the first harmonic .",
    "kpfm methods can be divided into two main categories : amplitude modulation ( am ) and frequency modulation ( fm ) . in closed loop",
    "am - kpfm , @xmath3 is adjusted by a feedback loop to the value @xmath4 that nullifies a signal that is proportional to @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 in closed loop fm - kpfm a signal is nullified that is approximately proportional to the amplitude of the first harmonic of the gradient of the electrostatic force ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . 2.18 ) , i.e. @xmath7",
    "because the subject of this work is the interpretation and modeling of the quantity @xmath4 obtained with kpfm on semiconductor samples we now introduce the theoretical background of the kelvin voltage and of its interpretation in terms of the cpd and bhs models .    upon electric connection of two conducting bodies with different work functions , a potential difference @xmath8 is generated between their surfaces .",
    "the work function , @xmath9 , of an object is defined as the energy to bring an electron from the bulk of the object to a position just outside its surface , in the absence of a net charge on the object and any external electric fields originating from other objects .",
    "@xmath9 can vary over the surface of an object with homogeneous bulk properties , because it contains contributions from potential drops at the surface , such as the band bending potential at the semiconductor surface .    to enable a simple theoretical discussion of kpfm measurements , we reduce the problem to one dimension . in this simplified configuration ,",
    "the connected kpfm probe and sample are positioned opposite each other and form a parallel plate capacitor .",
    "also , in this approximation , each has a single work function .",
    "hence , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the positive elementary charge and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the sample and probe work function , respectively .",
    "first we consider the case of ideal conductors with surface properties that are independent of any applied potentials . in this case",
    "the charge on each body is proportional to the total potential difference .",
    "we define the feedback voltage positive when a positive voltage is applied to the sample with respect to the probe .",
    "the total net charge per unit area is then @xmath14 the proportionality constant @xmath15 is the capacitance per unit area . at a plate distance @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the electrostatic force per unit area is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the permittivity of the medium in the gap .",
    "the first harmonic is then equal to @xmath20 clearly , in this ideal case we see from eqs ( [ amcondition ] ) and ( [ fmcondition ] ) that both am- and fm - kpfm methods lead to @xmath21 which is the cpd interpretation of @xmath4 . in the three - dimensional kpfm geometry , this corresponds to interpreting the measured potential as an approximation for the difference between the work function in a small area of the sample directly underneath the tip and the work function of the tip apex of the probe .    in the case of a semiconducting sample ( still probed with a metallic probe ) , the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "it is the main purpose of this paper to evaluate how kpfm results for this configuration should be interpreted .",
    "one main complication of a semiconducting sample is that electrical fields penetrate the sample and influence the charge distribution inside the sample .",
    "equivalently , the conduction- and valence - bands of the semiconductor are generally at a different position close to the surface as compared with the bulk , which is the well - known band - bending at semiconducting surfaces @xcite . as discussed in more detail below , the surface band bending changes the total potential difference between the surfaces of the two bodies .",
    "hence , @xmath22 is not simply proportional to the sum of the applied potential and the work function difference , as in ( [ qmetal ] ) . instead",
    ", the charge - voltage relation can be described with a voltage dependent capacitance per unit area , @xmath23 , as @xmath24 as a result , eq .",
    "( [ cpdinterp ] ) might not be valid for semiconducting samples and hence the cpd interpretation might be wrong . however , we now present a theoretical argument for its validity .",
    "the electrostatic force for a voltage dependent capacitance can still be written as in eq .",
    "( [ fideal ] ) @xcite . combining this expression with eq .",
    "( [ qsemi ] ) it is clear that without modulation of the potential , i.e. @xmath25 , @xmath26 will be zero when @xmath27 .",
    "however , this does not necessarily mean that with modulation @xmath5 will be nullified by @xmath28 . to solve this issue we use a similar approximation as was used by hudlet et al .",
    "we make a first order taylor expansion of @xmath29 around @xmath3 and take the term proportional to @xmath30 as an approximation for @xmath5 .",
    "this leads to @xmath31 with ( [ fideal ] ) and ( [ qsemi ] ) this becomes @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the antiderivative of @xmath23 . because @xmath23 is always positive , @xmath34 is a monotonically increasing function .",
    "hence , this approximation for @xmath2 is only nullified by @xmath28 .",
    "this indicates that the cpd interpretation given by eq .",
    "( [ cpdinterp ] ) is ( despite a voltage dependence of @xmath15 ) valid for kpfm on semiconductors . for fm - kpfm",
    ", there is just a @xmath35 added in front of eq .",
    "( [ fwfirstorder ] ) , see eq .",
    "( [ fmcondition ] ) . therefore , with the same reasoning , eq .",
    "( [ cpdinterp ] ) would also be valid for fm - kpfm .    in principle",
    ", higher order contributions to @xmath2 can shift @xmath36 from @xmath8 , but this can be avoided by keeping @xmath37 small .",
    "a more precise analysis of this effect requires careful consideration of the frequency dependent dynamics of the surface state charge and the space charge layer , which is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "baumgart et al .",
    "@xcite argued that the cpd interpretation is invalid for semiconductors and proposed the alternative bhs interpretation .",
    "to further investigate the merits of both interpretations , we evaluate them for a well defined situation : the potential difference @xmath38 between the _ p_- and _ n_-sides of _ pn_-homojunctions as measured by kpfm : @xmath39 where the subscripts @xmath40 and @xmath41 indicate that the values are evaluated on the _ p_- and _ n_-type areas , respectively . in the next two subsections",
    "we calculate @xmath38 for the cpd and bhs interpretations .      according to the cpd interpretation : @xmath42 which is clearly independent of the probe work function .",
    "therefore , we only need to consider the semiconductor work function in the modeling .",
    "[ banddiagram ] shows schematic energy level diagrams of a _",
    "p_-type semiconductor with bulk at the l.h.s . and surface at the r.h.s . in the diagrams .",
    "diagram ( a ) corresponds to a nonzero net charge and ( b ) to a zero net charge on the semiconductor . as is usual in such energy diagrams , the electron energy increases towards the top of the figure , hence electric potential increases towards the bottom .",
    "@xmath43 is the fermi level in the semiconductor and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the valence and conduction band energies in the bulk of the semiconductor , respectively . in the presence of surface charges or an external electric field , a so - called space charge region with non - zero net charge forms in the semiconductor just below the surface .",
    "this results in a potential difference , @xmath46 , between the bulk and the surface of the semiconductor , which is called the band bending potential .",
    "in addition to the band bending , there is usually a potential step @xmath47 at the surface of the semiconductor due to a fixed dipole layer on the surface , which can be caused by surface termination or a molecular layer adhered to the surface .",
    "we will assume that @xmath47 is independent of any external electric fields and also that it is equal for the _ p_- and _ n_-side of the _ pn_-junction .",
    "@xmath48 is the local vacuum level , defined ( following marshak @xcite ) as the energy of an electron at a given point if it were at rest and free from the microscopic potentials of the crystal atomic lattice , but not free from the macroscopic potentials , such as those generated at surfaces or interfaces .",
    "the bulk electron affinity , @xmath49 , is defined here as the energy required to bring an electron from the conduction band @xmath50 to the local vacuum level in the bulk of the material .    in fig .",
    "[ banddiagram](b ) the semiconductor has zero net charge , but there is still a band bending .",
    "this means that there is charge in the space charge region , which is compensated by surface charges .",
    "we label the band bending potential in this uncharged situation with @xmath51 .",
    "for this zero net charge case , the work function @xmath12 is the energy to bring an electron from the fermi level , @xmath52 , to the local vacuum level @xmath48 outside the semiconductor .",
    "this leads to @xmath53 ( note that in the figure @xmath51 is positive , while @xmath54 is negative ) .",
    "we define @xmath55 which is the energy difference between the fermi level and the conduction band at the surface .",
    "since it is assumed that the fixed surface dipole layer , @xmath54 is equal on both sides of the _ pn_-junction , the cpd interpretation for @xmath38 on the _ pn_-junctions ( [ pncpd ] ) becomes @xmath56 hence , @xmath38 can be obtained from the positions of the conduction band level in the bulk with respect to the fermi level , and @xmath51 .",
    "we quote the main part of the argument for the bhs model for kpfm on semiconductors from @xcite `` _ _ in order to minimize the electrostatic force @xmath57 onto the probe , the asymmetric electric - dipole layer has to be removed .",
    "this is achieved by injecting majority charge carriers into the surface region in order to screen the unscreened immobile ionized dopant atoms .",
    "the charge neutrality condition is only fulfilled when surface states discharge simultaneously__. '' supposedly , on _ n_-type semiconductors this is achieved by applying a potential equal to @xcite @xmath58 and on _",
    "p_-type @xmath59 in addition , they expect a sample specific potential offset that is , according to baumgart et al .",
    "@xcite , independent of the work function of the probe . as a result",
    ", this interpretation predicts that @xmath4 is independent of the probe work function , which directly contradicts the cpd interpretation ( eq .",
    "( [ cpdinterp ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ cpdws ] ) ) , which depends linearly on the probe work function .    direct application of eqs .",
    "( [ baumn ] ) and ( [ baump ] ) would result in negative values for @xmath38 , while in refs .",
    "@xcite they state only positive values .",
    "this is achieved by taking absolute values as described in ref .",
    "the resulting expression can be written as @xmath60    we note that , a priori , there appear to be some issues with the bhs model . in the one - dimensional description , even an asymmetric dipole layer at the semiconductor surface does not cause an electrostatic force .",
    "hence , the argument , that the dipole layer has to be removed in order to minimize the electrostatic force , seems to be invalid , unless taking into account the real geometry somehow justifies this assumption . at the same time , they state as a second condition that charge neutrality has to be fulfilled , which is also the condition underlying the cpd interpretation .",
    "however , it is unclear how these two conditions are met simultaneously by eqs .",
    "( [ baumn ] ) and ( [ baump ] ) .",
    "in addition , they apparently neglect the bulk work function difference , i.e. the work function difference minus the surface contributions , but do not mention why this is allowed . on the other hand , the bhs model seems to work well for the experiments analyzed by baumgart et al .",
    "@xcite , hence it is important to further discuss and test its validity , which we do below .      to predict @xmath61",
    ", we need to find the position of the band edges in the bulk with respect to the fermi level ( for cpd and bhs ) and the zero net charge band bending potential @xmath51 ( for cpd only ) .    for a non - degenerate _ n_-type semiconductor , the _ position of the band edges in the bulk with respect to the fermi level _",

    "( [ baumn ] ) and ( [ baump ] ) , is incorrect .",
    "this claim is in apparent agreement with the similar results they obtained with two highly doped _ p_-type and _ n_-type probes , which presumably have significantly different work functions .",
    "however , we experimentally investigated the probe work function independence for a number of different probes on differently doped si samples and on au , and found a clear and reproducible dependence on the probe material , see fig .",

    "each point in this figure is the mean of four 0.5  @xmath158  2  @xmath120 m raster scans of 32  lines with 128  pixels .",
    "it is generally accepted that in kpfm with a metallic sample and probe , @xmath36 is equal to the difference in the work functions of the sample and the probe @xcite .",
    "hence , the very similar probe dependence obtained on au and si strongly suggests that also on si kpfm measurements are dependent on the probe work function .",
    "this is in accordance with the cpd interpretation and not with the bhs interpretation .",
    "we speculate that the nearly identical results obtained with highly doped _",
    "p_-type and _ n_-type probes by baumgart et al . were caused by a very high density of surface states at the tip apex , which , through fermi level pinning , can lead to nearly identical work functions @xcite .",
    "the incorrect predictions of the bhs interpretation described in this section lead us to conclude that it is not universally valid for the interpretation of kpfm data obtained on semiconductors . in the next section , we give support for the correctness of the cpd interpretation and argue that it should be used instead .      to obtain @xmath61 from the cpd interpretation , one needs to know the doss and the fixed surface charge density . since these are generally unknown and difficult to measure , we fit the cpd interpretation with the five surface charge models described in section [ methods ] to all experimental results listed in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "although this disables a stringent test of the cpd interpretation , it turns out that this still gives constraints , due to the fact that the fit parameter of these models ( the total surface state density @xmath88 for the doss models and fixed surface charge density @xmath72 for the fixed surface charge models ) must be of reasonable value ( to be discussed below ) .",
    "more importantly , our purpose here is not to subject the cpd interpretation to scrutiny , but rather to demonstrate that  in contrast to the bhs interpretation  the cpd interpretation _ is _ capable of accommodating the experimental observations discussed in the previous section .",
    "the values of the fit parameters that reproduce the experimental @xmath61 values listed in table [ tab : table1 ] to 1 mv precision are presented in fig .",

    "we also calculated the sensitivity of the fit parameters by fitting them to the experimental values @xmath1595  mv .",

    "@xmath91  @xmath161  @xmath90 there is only one solution for each case .",
    "we consider values of @xmath88 and @xmath162 below @xmath163  @xmath90 to be reasonable , see @xcite .",
    "higher values are increasingly unlikely with increasing density . although the actual samples were possibly rough , surface state densities above the density of surface atoms ( @xmath164  @xmath90 ) are very unlikely for si surfaces that have been exposed to air . as a result ,",
    "the main conclusion from fig .",
    "[ fitresults ] is that all cases can be fit with a reasonable value of the fit parameter by at least one model .",
    "this demonstrates that the cpd interpretation _ is _ capable of accommodating the experimental observations discussed in the previous section .",
    "we will now use these fit results to draw some conclusions with respect to the validity of the five surface models for the individual cases .    case ( i )",
    "can be fit with all five models with reasonable fit parameter values ( i.e. below @xmath163  @xmath90 ) , while for case ( ii ) only the fixed positive surface charge model leads to reasonable values ; the other models lead to rather high densities .",
    "the experimental @xmath61 values of case ( i ) and ( ii ) are obtained from a single kpfm scan on a single sample with multiple _ pn_-junctions .",
    "hence , these junctions have undergone similar surface treatments , suggesting that their surface state density or fixed surface charge should be similar .",
    "therefore , since only the fixed positive surface charge model gives nearly identical fit results it is the most likely for both cases .",
    "in addition , in case ( ii ) all other models lead to very high parameter values .    as discussed in the previous section , cases ( vi ) and ( vii )",
    "correspond to samples that have identical _",
    "pn_-junctions , as far as dopant concentrations are concerned , but which have undergone different surface treatments .",
    "in contrast to the bhs interpretation , the cpd interpretation can accommodate different obtained @xmath61 by a different band bending @xmath67 , resulting from a different @xmath88 or @xmath72 . since all models , except the fixed positive surface charge , lead to rather high fit parameter values for these cases , the most likely explanation for the observed difference in @xmath61 is a higher positive @xmath72 in case ( vii ) than in case ( vi ) .    like case ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) , cases ( viii ) to ( x ) correspond to a single si sample with several _",
    "pn_-junctions that went through a single preparation process . for these cases",
    "it is therefore again reasonable to assume that the surface state density or fixed surface charge should be similar . interestingly , this corresponds well with the observation that for each model the fit parameter values for these three cases are very similar .",
    "however , the surface state models lead to rather high surface state densities and are therefore less likely .",
    "the negative fixed surface charge model is the only that leads to densities that are significantly below @xmath163  @xmath90 , but also the positive fixed surface charge model appears to be reasonable .    in the analysis of the experimental results of cases ( viii ) to ( x ) , volotsenko et al .",
    "@xcite assumed zero band bending , i.e. @xmath129 , on the highest doped _ p_-type region , which is the _ p_-side in case ( viii ) .",
    "however , in our calculations @xmath67 is larger than 400  mv in this region in all fitted cpd models , except in the negative fixed surface charge model , where it is only @xmath165  mv .",
    "this suggests that either the assumption was not justified , or there was a fixed negative surface charge .",
    "importantly , both conclusions would significantly influence the results of their further analysis .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that the cpd interpretation can accommodate all the results discussed in the previous section , even those for which the bhs interpretation gives predictions that do not agree with experiment .",
    "we have also shown that , contrary to the bhs interpretation , the cpd interpretation can accommodate different @xmath61 measured on identical _",
    "pn_-junctions that have gone through different surface preparation treatments . and , clearly",
    ", the erroneous bhs prediction that @xmath36 is independent of the probe work function is absent in the cpd interpretation ( see eq .",
    "( [ cpdinterp ] ) and ( [ cpdws ] ) ) .",
    "hence , in agreement with the theoretical arguments given in section [ kpprinciples ] , we posit that the cpd interpretation is valid for kpfm on semiconductors .",
    "in this work two different interpretations for kpfm measurements on semiconductors are studied ; the cpd interpretation and the bhs interpretation proposed by baumgart et al . @xcite . by performing model calculations",
    "we show that they generally lead to very different results and , thus , that it is important to decide which one should be used .",
    "we show that the bhs interpretation predicts kelvin potential differences as obtained by kpfm that are not in agreement with experimental observations on si _",
    "pn_-junctions that have been reported in literature .",
    "a more general incorrect prediction is that for a specific doping profile , it predicts a kpfm potential difference across a _ pn_-junction that is independent of the surface treatment , while some experimental potential differences reported in the literature are very different for different surface treatments .",
    "finally , it predicts that the absolute value of the measured potential is independent of the probe work function , while our own kpfm measurements on si demonstrate a clear dependence on the probe material .",
    "we find that this dependence is very similar to the dependence obtained on au , which suggests that on semiconductors the absolute value of the measured potential depends on probe work function in the same way as on au , as predicted by the cpd interpretation .",
