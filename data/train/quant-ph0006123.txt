    "quantum computing exploits the intrinsic quantum nature of physical systems and is therefore more powerful than classical computing for a certain class of problems .",
    "while some problems like factorization gain exponential speed up ( 1 ) , some others like database - search gain polynomial speed up ( 2 ) . a quantum computer works on two - level quantum systems known as ` quantum bits ' or ` qubits ' .",
    "the fact that qubits can exist in a coherent superposition of basis states is exploited in a quantum computer . however , retaining such a coherent superposition for long enough time is one of the major hurdles in quantum computation . since nuclear spins in liquids are efficiently isolated from the rest of their environment , the coherent superposition lasts for several hundreds of milliseconds . therefore , high resolution nmr of weakly coupled nuclear spins in liquids is one of the potential candidates for realizing such a quantum computer . nuclear spins with @xmath0=1/2",
    "have generally been used since spins with @xmath0@xmath11/2 relax much faster . quantum computing using one - dimensional nmr has been demonstrated by various workers ( 3 - 12 ) .    recently , quantum computing has been demonstrated using two - dimensional nmr ( 13 ) . in this method ,",
    "the states of the ` computation ' spins ( or input spins ) are encoded by the transitions of an extra ` observer ' spin ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the observer spin is first allowed to evolve for a time t@xmath2 during which , the input qubits remain in their initial state ( fig.2 ) . after the frequency",
    "labelling period t@xmath2 , the computation is performed on the input qubits .",
    "the observer spin is again allowed to evolve for a time t@xmath3 and detected .",
    "the experiment starts from a mixed input state , the computation is performed simultaneously on all the input states , and one gets a mixed output state .",
    "one can also create a superposition of input qubits in the beginning of the experiment by applying a @xmath4/2 pulse on the input qubits and subsequently killing the coherence by a gradient pulse ( 13 ) .",
    "various steps in two - dimensional nmr namely , preparation , evolution , mixing and detection have a close correspondence with the steps in quantum computing namely , creation of initial states , labeling of the initial states , computation and reading of output states , respectively ( 13 ) ( fig.2 ) . in this respect",
    ", two - dimensional nmr appears to be the ` method of choice ' for quantum computing .",
    "an advantage of the two - dimensional method is that it resolves all the input and the output states and correlates them .",
    "this correlation between input and output states in the two - dimensional experiment makes the result of the computation graphic .",
    "for example , a swap gate which exchanges the states of two qubits , can be implemented in nmr by selectively interchanging populations of zero - quantum levels . since the one - dimensional nmr spectrum of homonuclear spins after",
    "the execution of swap gate is indistinguishable from that of an equilibrium spectrum , the one - dimensional swap gate was earlier demonstrated after the creation of a non - equilibrium state ( 12 , 14 ) . however , as will be shown here ( fig.3 ) , and has been demonstrated earlier ( 13 ) , the two - dimensional method starts from the equilibrium state and yields a spectrum characteristic of the swap gate .",
    "two - dimensional quantum computation has been carried out so far by using scalar coupling evolution technique ( 13 ) .",
    "this paper describes a two dimensional nmr implementation of several two and three qubit gates with one extra observer spin , using spin- and transition - selective pulses .",
    "the first implementation of the deutsch - jozsa quantum algorithm using two - dimensional nmr is also demonstrated here .",
    "one of the advantages of the selective pulse method is that it makes the computation simple and straightforward .",
    "a weakly coupled 3-spin system ( i@xmath5i@xmath2i@xmath3 ) can be viewed as a combination of two 2-spin subsystems with the observer spin ( i@xmath5 ) being in state 0 or 1 ( fig.1 ) .",

    "energy level diagram of a 3-spin system ( i@xmath5i@xmath2i@xmath3 ) showing two 2-spin subsystems corresponding to states 0 and 1 of observer spin i@xmath5 .",
    "the transitions of i@xmath5 are labelled by the states of input qubits ( i@xmath2i@xmath3 ) . *    there are four observer spin transitions labelled as 11 , 10 , 01 and 00 , which correspond to the states of the input qubits ( i@xmath2i@xmath3 ) in these transitions . during the computation ( mixing ) period , various transitions of the input qubits",
    "are inverted yielding various gates as listed in table 1 .",
    "the results of 24 one - to - one reversible gates for the 3-spin system having one observer and two input qubits are shown in fig.3 .",
    "the nop gate is implemented by doing no operation during the computation period . in this gate , each input state corresponds to same output state after the computation .",
    "various not gates are implemented by inverting one or both of input qubits ( i@xmath2,i@xmath3 ) , using spin - selective @xmath4 pulses .",
    "xor ( or control - not ) and xnor gates are implemented by inverting two similar transitions of the same input spin , one in each subsystem .",
    "we label xor and xnor gates as xor1 , xnor1 and xor2 , xnor2 depending on whether the result of the operation is stored on the spin i@xmath2 or i@xmath3 respectively .",
    "for example , xor1 gate is implemented by inverting transitions 001 - 011 and 101 - 111 of i@xmath2 and the result of the gate is stored on i@xmath2 ( table 1 , fig.3 )",
    ". a swap gate can be implemented by selectively interchanging the populations of zero quantum levels of each subsystem ( table 1 , fig.3 ) .",
    "this can be achieved by the use of a cascade of three transition - selective , non - commuting @xmath4 pulses on regressively connected transitions during the computation period ( 12 , 14 ) .",
    "it may be noted that while all the gates of ref.(13 ) are reproduced here , with several new gates added , the methodology used for the computation is different except for the nop and not gates .",
    "similar to classical boolean expressions , quantum gates can be reduced to a sequence of simple unitary operations .",
    "although a few basic gates such as not , and , or , xor are sufficient to carryout a given computation , other gates are also useful since they may reduce the number of pulses",
