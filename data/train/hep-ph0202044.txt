    "theoretical studies of rare decays of @xmath2 quarks have attracted increasing attention since the start of the physics programme at the @xmath3 factories at kek and slac .",
    "many rare decays will be observed for the first time over the next few years , and in this talk we summarize our work on the decays @xmath1 and @xmath0 in the context of two models : i ) a supersymmetric ( susy ) model with unconstrained susy phases @xcite , and ii ) a model with a single generation of vector quarks @xcite .",
    "there is considerable motivation for measuring the br and cp asymmetry ( @xmath4 ) of the inclusive channel @xmath5 .",
    "in particular we highlight the following :    * @xmath1 transitions sizeably affect the measurements of @xmath4 for @xmath0 @xcite",
    ". therefore knowledge of @xmath4 for @xmath1 is essential , in order to compare experimental data with the theoretical prediction in a given model .",
    "* @xmath4 for the combined signal of @xmath6 and @xmath5 is expected to be close to zero in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , due the real wilson coefficients and the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "both of these conditions can be relaxed in models beyond the sm .",
    "there is much theoretical and experimental motivation to study the ratio @xmath7 because it provides a clean handle on the ratio @xmath8 @xcite . in the context of the sm",
    ", @xmath9 is expected to be in the range @xmath10 , corresponding to br@xmath11 of order @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath9 stays confined to this range in many popular models beyond the sm .",
    "this is because new particles such as charginos and charged higgs bosons in susy models contribute to @xmath13 with the same ckm factors .",
    "therefore @xmath14 is universal to both decays and cancels out in the ratio @xmath9 . in a model with vector quarks",
    "this is not the case , and we shall see that @xmath9 can be suppressed or enhanced with respect to the sm .",
    "@xmath15 is given by : @xmath16 in the sm @xmath17 is expected to lie in the range @xmath18 @xcite , where the uncertainty arises from varying the wolfenstein parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 in their allowed ranges .",
    "therefore @xmath17 is much larger than @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath0 can not be properly separated , then only @xmath23 of a combined sample can be measured .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that @xmath21 and @xmath24 approximately cancel each other in the sm , leading to a combined asymmetry close to zero .",
    "a reliable prediction of @xmath25 in a given model is necessary since it contributes to the measurement of @xmath26 .",
    "the cleo result @xcite is sensitive to a weighted sum of cp asymmetries , given by : @xmath27 the latest measurement stands at @xmath28 ( 90% c.l . )",
    "the small coefficient of @xmath25 is caused by the smaller br@xmath11 ( assumed to be @xmath29 that of br@xmath30 ) and inferior detection efficiencies .",
    "if the detection efficiencies for both decays were identical , this measured quantity would coincide with the weighted sum of the asymmetries @xmath31    the two terms in eqs .",
    "( [ cleoeq],[acpcombined ] ) can be of equal or of opposite sign , i.e.  they can contribute constructively or destructively to the combined asymmetry .",
    "negligible contribution of @xmath1 to this combined asymmetry should be verifiable at proposed future high luminosity runs of @xmath3 factories .",
    "we now show numerical results for the two models considered .      in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath25 against @xmath32 , which clearly shows that a light @xmath33 may drive @xmath17 positive , reaching maximal values close to @xmath34 . for @xmath33 heavier than 250 gev",
    "the @xmath17 lies within the sm range , which is indicated by the two horizontal lines . in fig .  2 we plot @xmath17 against @xmath21 .",
    "one can see that both @xmath21 and @xmath17 may have either sign , resulting in constructive or destructive interference in eq .",
    "( [ cleoeq ] ) .    in fig .  3 we plot the @xmath35 ( defined in eq .  ( [ cleoeq ] ) ) against @xmath21",
    "if the contribution from @xmath17 were ignored in eq .",
    "( [ cleoeq ] ) , then fig .",
    "3 would be a straight line through the origin .",
    "the @xmath17 contribution broadens the line to a thin band of width @xmath36 , an effect which should be detectable at proposed higher luminosity runs of the @xmath3 factories .      in fig .",
    "4 we plot @xmath25 against @xmath26 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath26 does not substantially differ from its sm value , while @xmath37 can vary over a much larger range .",
    "the correlation between @xmath25 and br@xmath38 is studied in detail in fig .  5 , where it can be seen that @xmath39 occurs only for br@xmath40 .",
    "branching ratios of this magnitude would require @xmath41 @xmath42 pairs to be detected which is beyond the discovery potential of current @xmath3 factories .    in fig .",
    "6 we plot the combined cp asymmetry as defined in eqn.([acpcombined ] ) against the argument of @xmath43 .",
    "note that in our analysis br@xmath44 and @xmath26 are close to their sm values .",
    "the huge variations in @xmath45 stem from the variation in br@xmath38 . in wide ranges of our parameter space",
    ", @xmath1 actually dominates the combined asymmetry ! any large signal observed in @xmath45 is a sign of physics beyond the sm , but although br@xmath46 is strongly dominated by @xmath47 , a non  sm value for @xmath45 can stem from both @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
