    "ground state wave function is of great importance in understanding a new state of matter . right after the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprate , based on the conjecture that the cuprate superconductor be a doped mott insulator , anderson proposed @xcite a resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) ground state , which may be simply expressed as @xmath6 denotes an ordinary bcs state and @xmath7 the gutzwiller projection operator enforcing the no double occupancy constraint due to strong on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "such a ground state has been intensely studied @xcite variationally since then , which will be referred to as the anderson s one - component rvb wave function .",
    "the no double occupancy constraint is just one of the most essential characterizations of mott physics .",
    "the residual superexchange coupling will further cause antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations between the singly occupied spins , leading to an af mott insulator at half - filling described by the heisenberg type model .",
    "last but not least , due to strong on - site coulomb repulsion , the original fermi signs of the electrons will be replaced by the so - called phase string sign structure@xcite , which has been precisely identified in the @xmath0-@xmath1@xcite and hubbard@xcite models for arbitrary doping , temperature and dimensions on a bipartite lattice .",
    "these three constitute the basic organizing principles for the strongly correlated electrons in a doped mott insulator .",
    "based on the above three guiding principles , a new class of ground state wave function has been constructed recently , whose compact form may be written as follows@xcite @xmath8 denotes a spin background ( `` vacuum '' ) always remaining singly occupied .",
    "the doped holes ( of total number @xmath9 ) are created in pairs on such a `` vacuum '' via @xmath10{c}_{i\\uparrow } { c}_{j\\downarrow } , \\ ] ] with the no double occupancy being automatically maintained . here",
    "the sign structure is implemented by a phase shift operator @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a statistical angle satisfying @xmath13 with @xmath14 defined as the down - spin number operator solely acting on @xmath15 , commuting with the @xmath16-operators in @xmath17 .",
    "here the wave function @xmath18 has a two - component rvb structure , with @xmath15 characterizing the neutral spin correlation ( which reduces to the true ground state of the heisenberg model at half - filling ) and @xmath17 the cooper pairing , respectively , improving the original anderson s one - component rvb state @xmath19 . the novelty of eq .",
    "( [ scgs-0 ] ) lies in that the doped holes and the spin background are _ nonlocally entangled _ by the phase shift operator @xmath20 , such that each doped hole will always feel the influence from the background spins , and vice versa .",
    "the interplay will then reshape both neutral rvb and charge pairing as a function of doping and result in a phase diagram _ self - consistently _ , which provides @xcite a systematic understanding / explanation of af , superconducting , and pseudogap phenomena observed in the cuprate .",
    "in particular , if only a single hole doped into the mott insulator is considered , @xmath21 in eq .  ( [ scgs-0 ] )",
    "is reduced to @xmath22 with @xmath23 replacing the pairing amplitude @xmath24 since there is only one hole here ( created by annihilating an electron with @xmath25-spin , without loss of generality ) .",
    "such a single - hole state should be contrasted with a more conventional bloch type state @xmath26 assuming @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) .",
    "here one has @xmath28 under the translational transformation @xmath29 of the hole coordinate in a featureless spin background .",
    "but such a translational symmetry of the _ single hole _",
    "is in general not obeyed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) .    in principle , it is not _ a priori _ that the doped hole should carry a _ conserved _ momentum @xmath30 in the mott insulator , satisfying the same bloch theorem for a doped hole in a semiconductor .",
    "if it does , then one says that the doped hole behaves like a landau s quasiparticle with well - defined charge , spin , effective mass and momentum , which is the basis for the fermi liquid theory of weakly interacting electrons .",
    "however , the no double occupancy constraint in a mott insulator means that the electrons are localized at each lattice site by strong interaction at half - filling , implying the loss of the translational symmetry of the charge . a doped hole moving on the neutralized spin background of thermodynamic scale does not restore the charge translational symmetry immediately . as a matter of fact ,",
    "in an early study of a single hole doped @xmath0-@xmath1 model , it has been rigorously shown @xcite that the hole acquires an irreparable many - body phase shift , i.e. , the phase string , which demonstrates a general breakdown of the translational symmetry for the charge , supporting the argument of anderson @xcite that the hole doped into a mott insulator does not become a well - defined quasiparticle due to a nontrivial scattering phase shift .    the two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder as a stack of two one - dimensional chains can serve as an ideal minimal model to test the novel phase string effect as well as the variational wave function eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) , which can be accurately studied numerically by density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method@xcite . at half - filling ,",
    "the spins are short - range af correlated such that the ground state is gapped@xcite .",
    "a single doped hole should not change the background spin correlation at long distance . from a more conventional point of view",
    ", the hole is expected to only carry a small distortion ( spin polaron ) in the spin background surrounding it with well - defined charge , spin , effective mass and a conserved momentum@xcite just like a landau s quasiparticle .",
    "however , the dmrg study has shown exotic behaviors upon doping@xcite . specifically , by tuning an anisotropic parameter @xmath31 of the two - leg ladder , a critical value at @xmath32 is found@xcite such that in the strong rung case of @xmath5 the doped hole indeed behaves like a conventional quasiparticle with a well - defined momentum . however , at @xmath4 the momentum splits continuously as a function of @xmath33 , accompanied by incommensurate charge modulations which violate the translational symmetry@xcite . by examining@xcite",
    "the charge response to an inserting flux into the ring of the two - leg ladder , an exponential decay with the circumference of the ring indicates the doped charge loses its phase coherence or momentum conservation to become `` localized '' at a sufficiently long distance at @xmath4 , in sharp contrast to a coherent quasiparticle behavior at @xmath5 .",
    "further surprising arises@xcite when two holes are injected into the gapped spin ladder , where a strong binding between the two holes occurs at @xmath4 and simultaneously the charge modulation disappears with restoring the translational symmetry .",
    "microscopically , the above novel properties can all be attributed to the phase string sign structure hidden in the bipartite @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder .",
    "as has been clearly demonstrated in the dmrg calculations@xcite , if one artificially turns off the phase string sign structure in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , which results in the so - called @xmath34@xmath35-@xmath1 model@xcite , the ordinary bloch wave behavior of the doped hole is immediately recovered in the _ whole _ regime of @xmath31 with no more critical @xmath32 .",
    "simultaneously two doped holes are no longer paired@xcite .",
    "although how the phase string effect is responsible for the physics at @xmath4 has been qualitatively discussed in ref .  , a microscopic and quantitative understanding of the dmrg results is still lacking .",
    "recently , a paper by white , scalapino , and kivelson @xcite has reconfirmed the existence of @xmath32 in the one - hole - doped two - leg ladder by dmrg under open boundary condition , together with the charge modulation and the momentum splitting at @xmath4 found in the earlier works .",
    "but they gave a different physical interpretation on the nature of the hole state at @xmath4 and argued that the hole would still behave like a bloch quasiparticle at momenta different from that at @xmath5 .",
    "however , many issues remain unanswered there , including the microscopic origin of the critical @xmath32 , the necessary role of the phase string effect that causes the charge modulation and momentum splitting in contrast to the @xmath34@xmath35-@xmath1 model , the pairing between two doped holes , as well as the oscillation and exponential decay of the energy difference with the ladder length under a periodic boundary condition with inserting different fluxes , etc . in particular , how to meaningfully identify the landau type quasiparticle is actually rather subtle in such a strongly correlated system , as to be clearly shown in this work .    in this paper",
    ", we study the one - hole - doped two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder based on the ground state @xmath36 [ eq .  ( [ eq : wf ] ) ] using variational monte carlo ( vmc ) method .",
    "the continuous phase transition at @xmath32 will be naturally reproduced by @xmath36 as a function of @xmath31 . as a matter of fact",
    ", we find that @xmath37 at the @xmath3 matches with that found by dmrg@xcite _",
    "quantitatively_. such a wave function can then provide a direct understanding on how a doped hole moves on a mott - insulator spin background with short - ranged af correlations .    at small @xmath31 ( @xmath38 ) ,",
    "the ground state @xmath36 is shown to have a finite overlap with the simple bloch wave state @xmath39 at @xmath40 .",
    "conversely , if the bloch wave function @xmath39 is used as the variational state , the same @xmath41 is also reproduced .",
    "it means that the one - hole state @xmath36 indeed describes a coherent quasiparticle of the landau s paradigm .",
    "namely , the quasiparticle has the same quantum numbers ( charge , spin , and momentum ) in both states , which differ only by the effective mass and thus allow for an adiabatic connection between them .",
    "in fact , in the limit of @xmath42 , the phase factor @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) can be absorbed into the hole wave function @xmath44 such that @xmath36 is explicitly shown to be smoothly connected to the bloch state @xmath39 .    at @xmath4 , an incommensurate momentum splitting ( or fermi point reconstruction )",
    "is exhibited in @xmath36 , accompanying a charge density modulation , also in excellent agreement with the dmrg result . however ,",
    "if one still uses the bloch state @xmath39 as a variational state , the momentum carried by the hole is found to always remain commensurate at @xmath45 , such that there is no overlap between @xmath36 and @xmath46 at @xmath4 .",
    "consequently the doped hole can no longer be described as a landau - type quasiparticle due to the breakdown of the one - to - one correspondence between a bare electron and a quasiparticle with the same momentum .    here",
    "the incommensurate momenta in @xmath36 as well as the charge density modulation can be clearly related to the intrinsic quantum interference pattern due to the phase string effect .",
    "the results are in sharp contrast to the scenario in which the charge modulation is simply interpreted@xcite as a standing wave of two opposite - propagating bloch waves mixed only by the reflection at _ open boundaries _ of the two - leg ladder . in other words ,",
    "the present charge modulation is related to the absence of the translational symmetry in the bulk of the ladder where the phase string effect is unscreened at @xmath4 because of the spatial separation of the hole and its spin partner with increasing @xmath31@xcite . on the other hand , in the @xmath47@xmath0-@xmath1 model where the phase string sign structure is absent , we show that the single - hole ground state indeed reduces to the bloch - like one @xmath46 with @xmath48 , in which the landau s quasiparticle description works in the whole regime of @xmath49 , again in good agreement with the dmrg result .",
    "the bottomline is that the ground state @xmath36 can well capture the essential properties of the one - hole - doped two - leg @xmath0-@xmath1 ladder found in the dmrg simulation . given the gapped spin vacuum , these novel properties are solely associated with the phase string induced by the doped hole , whose effect can not be reduced to simply renormalizing the effective mass of a landau s quasiparticle at @xmath4 . here the many - body phase string factor @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) prohibits a perturbative approach starting from a bloch state , leading to the intrinsic translational symmetry breaking of the charge . in the end of the paper",
    ", we shall also briefly discuss how the phase string effect further renders the hole self - localized through an ultimate translational symmetry breaking , which involves a many - body correction to the hole wave function @xmath44 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wf ] , we introduce the model and further discuss the bloch - like and non - bloch - like single - hole variational wave functions .",

    "we then show both analytically and numerically that the bloch - like wave function well captures the essential properties of the @xmath34@xmath50@xmath0-@xmath1 model , of which the sign structure is merely the marshall sign@xcite rather than the phase string ( see appendix  [ appen : sigma ] ) .",
