    "the local background has been estimated : in annular regions around each ero centroid , as the average of eigth circular regions ( 2 arcsec radius ) for each ero position and from a background map produced by the wavdetect algorithm .",
    "the different choiches do not significantly affect the results in none of the adopted energy bands , except the 28 kev range where the results are strongly affected by the increased level of the instrumental background .",

    "1997 ) and it is similar to that of the starburst galaxy m82 ( e.g. , griffiths et  al . 2000 ; kaaret et  al .",
    "2001 ) ; the average x  ray spectrum ( see sect .",
    "3 ) is consistent with that measured for nearby star  forming galaxies ( e.g. dahlem , weaver & heckman 1998 ; ptak et al .",
    "+ we have also investigated whether the stacked signal could be due to a few individual sources just below the detection threshold .",
    "this is particulary relevant for our sample which may contain a few sub - threshold agn responsible for the entire stacked signal .",
    "five out of 12 `` dusty '' eros are individually `` detected '' at the 9599% confidence level .",
    "the x  ray luminosity for these `` marginally detected '' eros never exceeds @xmath54 erg s@xmath3 in the full  band excluding the presence of a bright agn among the stacked dusty eros .",
    "although the presence of a low  luminosity agn ( llagn ) can not be completely ruled out on the basis of the present analysis , in the following we assume that the `` dusty '' eros are mainly powered by starburst related processes .",
    "there is an increasing evidence that the hard x  ray luminosity of star ",
    "forming objects can be used as a star formation rate ( sfr ) indicator ( ranalli , comastri , & setti 2002a , b ; nandra et al .",
    "2002 ; bauer et al .",
    "+ using the ranalli et al . relation yr@xmath3 ) = 2.0 @xmath55 l@xmath56 ( erg s@xmath3 ) ] we have derived an average sfr for the eros in the `` dusty '' sample of 544 m@xmath57 yr@xmath3 , taking into account the observed dispersion between the far  infrared and x  ray luminosities quoted by ranalli et al . , and the uncertainties on the hard x  ray luminosity .",
    "the average sfr derived from the the observed [ oii ] luminosity ( kennicutt 1998 ) is sfr([oii])@xmath58=2.7 m@xmath59 yr@xmath3 .",
    "the discrepancy between the optical and x  ray sfr estimates confirms that the optical emission lines are severely obscured by dust and the optical value can be addressed as a _ lower limit_. in order to provide a dereddened sfr estimate , the average spectrum was compared with template spectra of star forming galaxies and dusty systems ( as extensively discussed in cimatti et al .",
    "2002a ) ; the best ",
    "fit estimates for the reddening are in the range @xmath60 , which implies an intrinsic average sfr of the order 37110 m@xmath57 yr@xmath3 according to the kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation .",
    "although the two estimates suffer of large uncertainties , mainly related to the scatter of the various sfr indicators , they can be reconciled if the lowest extinction correction ( e.g. , @xmath61 , or even lower ) is applied to correct the [ oii ] luminosity .    from the derived x  ray sfr it is possible to estimate the average far  infrared ( 60100 @xmath62 m ) and radio ( 1.4 ghz ) emission of the objects in our sample : l@xmath63 l@xmath57 ; l@xmath64 erg s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the relatively low value of l@xmath65 would naturally explain the low detection rate of eros in submillimeter continuum follow  up observations , typically sensitive to detect ultra  luminous infrared galaxies ( uligs , l@xmath66 l@xmath57 ) at @xmath67 ( e.g. , mohan et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the `` dusty '' ero population would then be representative of less luminous dusty star  forming systems , with respect to submillimeter ",
    "selected high  z galaxies , as already pointed out in cimatti et al ( 2002a ) .",
    "+ the inferred radio luminosity corresponds to k  corrected ( s@xmath68 , @xmath69 ) radio fluxes in the range 4 - 38@xmath62jy .",
    "the lack of deep radio observations in the _ chandra _ deep field south area prevents to test these predictions ; however , it is interesting to note that very deep 1.4 ghz vla observations of a sample of optically selected eros ( smail et al .",
    "2002 ) agree with our estimates ( about 85% of the eros in their sample is not detected in the radio band at fluxes higher than @xmath70 @xmath62jy ) .",
    "thanks to the deep limiting fluxes reached in the 1 ms exposure of the _ chandra _ deep field south and to the subarcsec positional accuracy of the x  ray satellite , it was possible to constrain via stacking analysis the high  energy properties of a well  defined , spectroscopically identified sample of eros , belonging to the k20 survey .",
    "+ the dichotomy in the optical classifications of eros seems to be present also in the x  ray band : `` dusty '' objects are relatively bright x  ray sources , while `` old '' eros are below the detection threshold .",
    "+ the only object ( cxo cdfs  j033213.9 - 274526 ) individually detected by _",
    "chandra _ is a luminous , highly absorbed agn ( n@xmath71 @xmath30 ) at @xmath21 .",
    "+ using the hard x  ray luminosity as a sfr indicator , which is essentially free from intrinsic absorption , we have estimated a relatively low sfr ( 544 m@xmath57 yr@xmath3 ) with respect to the estimate based on the reddening ",
    "dependent [ oii ] emission ; our estimate is consistent with the results of recent far  infrared and radio observations .",
    "+ deep x  ray observations of large and complete samples of spectroscopically identified eros could provide a powerful tool to estimate , via stacking analysis , the average star formation rate in `` dusty '' systems and to better assess the agn fraction among the ero population .",
