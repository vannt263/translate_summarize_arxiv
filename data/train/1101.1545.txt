    "x - ray emission is seen universally in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and offers a wealth of information about the geometrical and physical make - up of the accreting supermassive black holes at the hearts of distant galaxies .",
    "the primary x - ray continuum is thought to arise from the hot , comptonizing electron or electron - positron pair corona close to the black hole ( haardt et al.1994 ) . in many galaxies and especially in seyferts the continuum is reprocessed by the accretion disk or other circumnuclear material creating commonly seen reflection features : the fe k emission around 67 kev and the so - called compton reflection hump peaking around 2030 kev .",
    "nandra & pounds ( 1994 ) performed a spectral survey of 27 seyferts observed with _",
    "ginga _ in the 1.537 kev range and confirmed that fe lines and compton reflection humps were indeed common",

    "however each of these instruments lacks broadband coverage above about 10 kev , which complicates determination of the underlying continuum .    in the last decade",
    "the 20100 kev sky has become more accessible , a development which is especially interesting for agn because 20100 kev agn fluxes do not suffer from absorption by gas along the line of sight to the nucleus .",
    "_ integral_and _ swift_-batsurveys are turning up large numbers of obscured agn ( including some that are rather bright above 20 kev ) which are difficult to study in lower energy bands ( e.g. winter et al.2009 , bird et al.2007 ) .",
    "these surveys yield detections and fluxes , and constrain agn number densities and luminosity functions .",
    "however , for energy spectra in this band , the community has relied mainly on _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , _ bepposax_and _ suzaku _ , and less recently , _",
    "high energy astronomy observatory-1 ( heao-1 ) _ and the _ compton gamma ray observatory s _ oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment ( _ cgro_-osse ) . of these , _ rxte _ , launched at the end of 1995 , is the longest currently running x - ray mission and the public archive contains over 14 years worth of data .    in this paper , we have taken advantage of the large quantity of agn data and _ rxte _ s broad bandpass to investigate the form of agn x - ray spectral data .",
    "we concentrate on quantifying the strengths of compton reflection components which will tighten constraints on the quantities of compton - thick circumnuclear gas , and searching for cutoffs or rollovers in the high - energy power - law continuum , which could place constraints on thermal comptonization processes in the corona ( haardt et al .",
    "1994 ) . we have closely examined _",
    "rxte_archival data for 23 of the x - ray brightest agn and we were able to construct spectra summed over the last 14 years covering from 3 to above 100 kev .",
    "our analysis takes advantage of the fact that the two pointed - observation instruments , the proportional counter array ( pca ) and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) , are always operating simultaneously , removing ambiguity due to source variability inherent in splicing non - simultaneous  @xmath110 and @xmath210 kev data sets from different missions as is commonly done to achieve broadband coverage .    _ rxte_has been commonly used for continuous and sustained long - term monitoring and many of the x - ray brightest agn have been monitored for at least 510 years . for many of the objects in our sample ,",
    "the spectra are time - averaged over timescales of years , and thus this paper serves as a reference for long - term average spectral properties in the hard and very hard x - ray bands . for these sources , this complements the information obtained from individual `` long - look '' spectra , as are commonly obtained with many other x - ray observatories for which monitoring is difficult ( e.g. , _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ ) .",
    "this investigation also serves to support the legacy of _ rxte_by maximizing the agn science return from hexte .",

    "rxte_public archive is highly inhomogeneous , as targets were proposed by various groups for a variety of reasons .",
    "this includes , for example , multi - timescale , continuous monitoring of seyferts for power spectral density ( psd ) measurements , long - look style observations for tens of ks at a time , and target of opportunity observations on flaring blazars as part of multi - wavelength campaigns . for each target , we simply used all data available in the public archive regardless of sampling .",

    "light curves in figures [ lc1][lc3 ] show the distribution of observations over the past 14 years .",
    "we did not make any effort to isolate a particular class of agn .",
    "target selection was guided by hexte data quality alone .",
    "our goal was to obtain high - quality spectra out to at least 100 kev for each case .",
    "this required the combination of the source being sufficiently x - ray bright in the 20100 kev range and having been observed with a sufficiently long exposure time .",

    "hence this sample is not statistically complete , for example we did not have any narrow line seyfert 1 s in our sample since they tend to be faint and have steeper spectra than typical broad line seyfert 1 s ( grupe et al.1999 , vaughan et al.2001 , xu et al.2003 ) and none which were observed by _",

    "some objects have pca + hexte spectra already published , but in most cases we update these spectra by including additional data .    table [ tabsample ] lists the source name , agn type , redshift ( @xmath3 ) , and the galactic column density @xmath11 , as well as the total exposure time for each of the _ rxte_instruments .",

    "seyfert 1 s include seyfert 11.5 s while seyfert 2 s include seyfert 1.82 s .",
    "the distinction between compton - thick and compton - thin seyfert 2 s is important to us since the compton - thick sources tend to have much more complicated x - ray spectra potentially causing model degeneracy in fitting .",
    "more details can be found in the notes on each compton - thick source . since 3c  273 has x - ray spectral properties more closely resembling a blrg than a typical blazar ( displays an fe line and a very weak compton hump ) , it is included with these solely for the purpose of spectral analysis in this paper .      for all pca and hexte data extraction and analysis we used heasoft version 6.7 software .",
    "the pca consists of five large - area , collimated proportional counter units ( pcus ) .",

    "we found tentative evidence for high - energy rollovers in the spectra of only three objects , circinus , ngc  4945 , and mr  2251178 ; we obtained lower limits of very roughly 100 kev for the remaining objects implying kt @xmath075 kev in thermal comptonization models .",
    "the time - averaged model fits in this paper may be used in future time- or flux - resolved analyses of _ rxte_monitoring data to test for variations in the absorbing or reflecting components to constrain their locations and/or distributions .",
    "we conclude by commenting that future in - depth study of targets whose spectra require highly complex model fits , such as circinus and ngc  4945 , can yield fewer model degeneracies and better constraints on @xmath38 , @xmath83 , etc .",
    ", provided that observations are made with instruments featuring a combination of ccd - like ( or better ) energy resolution and broad energy coverage up to at least hundreds of kev .",
    "such observations are also required for further progress in better constraining the high - energy rollovers in seyferts and understanding the properties of the x - ray corona , as well as allowing for testing of the newest compton reflection models ( e.g. , murphy & yaqoob 2009 ) .",

( 2009 ) .",

    "virtually identical fits were found when the power - law of the flaring emission was absorbed by the total galactic column ( @xmath11@xmath312 @xmath6 ) or unabsorbed .",

    "the galactic latitude and longitude of ngc  4945 are roughly 305  and @xmath31413 , respectively , i.e. , not close enough to either the galactic center or anti - center to convincingly bolster or diminish the source s likelihood of being galactic in origin based on sky location alone .",
    "there are no sources in the _ rxte _ all - sky monitor source catalog in the pca field of view , though there are numerous unidentified soft x - ray sources within 1@xmath12 of the position of ngc  4945 detected with the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( white et al.2000 ) and detected in the _ xmm - newton _ serendipitous source catalog .",
    "assuming that the source is located in the host galaxy of ngc  4945 , at a luminosity distance of 11.1 mpc , the 210 kev luminosity assuming isotropic emission is @xmath315 erg s@xmath9 , which is about 2/3 the 210 kev luminosity of the nucleus of ngc  4945 after accounting for absorption ( see table [ tabflux ] ) .",
    "this luminosity is slightly higher than typical x - ray luminosities inferred for ulx sources , @xmath316 erg s@xmath9 ( winter et al .",
    "2006 ) , and so we can not confirm the emission as originating in a ulx on basis of luminosity alone . in a _ suzaku _ observation of ngc",

    "_ observations of ngc  4945 in spring of 2006 , it is not clear if the soft excess emission seen in the 2006 may 20 observation can be identified with this ulx .    assuming instead that the source is located in our galaxy at a distance which lies in the range 215 kpc , then the 210 kev luminosity is in the range @xmath317 erg s@xmath9 , roughly consistent with many types of galactic compact accreting sources . accreting gbh systems , during transition states between the low / hard and high / soft spectral states , can exhibit strong flaring with emission that can be quantified as a power law with @xmath318 ( e.g. , pottschmidt et al .",
    "strong , rapid ( durations of hours ) flaring with soft spectra in the @xmath110 kev range can also be produced by supergiant fast x - ray transients , e.g. , sidoli et al .",
