    "the concepts and methods of percolation theory are widely used to explain many phenomena in physics , classical as well as quantum ( for review see e.g. refs .",
    "the canonical model for studying transport properties of disordered systems is percolation on a lattice .",
    "usually it is also assumed that the conductivity between neighboring lattice sites may be defined as either finite , or zero ( i.e. , either conducting or insulating ) without loss of generality . this model [ which we denote as the bond ( or site )",
    "percolation ] has been extensively studied and is understood quite well . for the description of the nearest neighbor hopping in granular materials it is much more natural to define the conductivity between two neighboring lattice sites ( labeled as `` i '' and `` j '' ) by @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 is the distance between the two sites , @xmath14 is the scale over which the wave - function outside the grain decays , @xmath15 is the energy difference between grains , and @xmath16 is the temperature . here",
    "we neglect the thermal hopping term ( high temperature regime ) and consider only nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "this behavior may be captured by a lattice model for which @xcite @xmath17 , \\label{hopping}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a measure of disorder , @xmath18 is a random number taken from uniform distribution in the range ( 0,1 ) , and @xmath19 is a dimension coefficient @xcite .",
    "we shall name this model the hopping percolation model .",
    "one might expect that such small differences in the formulation of the disorder in the @xmath20 ( namely , @xmath21 or @xmath22 $ ] ) will lead to no important difference in the global conductance properties of these systems .",
    "quite surprisingly , recent experiments on the conductance of granular material @xcite might suggest otherwise . specifically , the number of red bonds ( which are critical for current ) expected in framework of the traditional percolation theory is proportional to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the percolation correlation critical exponent and @xmath2 is the system size @xcite .",
    "thus , for a typical experimental set - up of @xmath25 grains , one expects @xmath26 red bonds . on the other hand , measurements of transport through ni granular ferromagnets , indicates a much lower number of red bonds ( typically of order one ) @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite we have attributed this difference to the fact that the estimation of the number of red bonds ( @xmath23 ) is based on the bond percolation model , while for the hopping percolation we expect a transition to a regime of extreme strong disorder in which a _ single _ red bond governs the behavior of the system .",
    "the onset of this regime scales as to @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to note that in contrast to the traditional bond ( or site ) percolation model , in which the system is either a metal or an insulator , for the hopping percolation model the system always conducts some current . hopping conductivity ( i.e. , exponential local resistance ) ( [ hopping ] )",
    "is always associated with _",
    "strong disorder_. as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are two regimes within this strong disorder : a regime which is not sensitive to the removal of a single bond , as expected from the usual percolation theory , termed the _ usual strong disorder _ regime @xcite . while for even stronger disorder a regime which is very sensitive to the removal of a specific single bond exists , denote as _ extreme disorder_. in the extreme disorder regime a single bond can determine the transport properties of the entire macroscopic system @xcite .",
