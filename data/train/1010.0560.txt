    "this kind of first passage problems have been widely studied by mathematicians since the early sixties @xcite , often inspired by engineering applications . during the last fifteen years",
    "these problems have received a considerable attention in the context of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics of spatially extended systems , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . in various relevant physical situations , ranging from coarsening dynamics to fluctuating interfaces and polymer chains",

    "the _ local _ magnetization , _",
    "i.e. _ , the value @xmath23 of a single spin , is the physically relevant stochastic process @xmath24 and the corresponding persistence probability turns out to decay algebraically at long times . by contrast , at any non - vanishing temperature @xmath25 , the spins fluctuate very rapidly in time due to the coupling to the thermal bath and therefore the persistence probability of an individual spin decays exponentially in time .",
    "however , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the _ global _ magnetization , _ i.e. _ , the spatial average of the local magnetization over the entire ( large ) sample , is characterized by a persistence probability @xmath2  referred to as global persistence  which decays algebraically in time @xmath26 at temperatures @xmath27 below the critical temperature @xmath28 of the model .",
    "the case corresponding to @xmath29 , which we shall focus on here , is particularly interesting because @xmath30 turns out to be a new universal exponent associated to the critical behavior of these systems .",
    "the global persistence for critical dynamics has since been studied in a variety of instances  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent study of the global persistence below @xmath28 ) .    in order to understand how the long - time behavior of the persistence probability at fixed @xmath29 crosses over from the exponential of the local magnetization to the algebraic of the global one , majumdar and bray  @xcite introduced and studied the persistence of the total magnetization of a @xmath1-dimensional sub manifold of a @xmath0-dimensional system , with @xmath31 ( a similar idea was put forward in ref .",

    "the two limiting cases @xmath32 and @xmath10 correspond , respectively , to the local and the global magnetization and therefore a crossover from an exponential ( @xmath33 ) to an algebraic ( @xmath10 ) decay is expected in the persistence probability as @xmath1 is varied from @xmath34 to @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly enough , it turns out that as a function of @xmath1 the persistence probability @xmath2 of the manifold displays _ three _ qualitatively different long - time behaviors , depending on the value of a single parameter @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the co - dimension of the manifold , @xmath6 the dynamical critical exponent and @xmath5 the fisher exponent which characterizes the anomalous algebraic decay of the static two - point spatial correlation function of the spins . as a function of @xmath37 one finds  @xcite @xmath38 where the exponent @xmath39 is a new universal exponent which depends on both @xmath1 and @xmath0 , whereas @xmath40 and @xmath41 are non - universal constants .",
    "interestingly enough , from the mathematical point of view , the somewhat unexpected stretched exponential behavior for @xmath42 emerges as a consequence of a theorem due to newell and rosenblatt  @xcite which connects the long - time decay of the persistence probability of a stationary process to the long - time decay of its two - time correlation function . in passing , we mention that a behavior similar to eq .",

    ", this initial condition implies that the average @xmath44 of the fluctuating magnetization at time @xmath45 over the possible realizations of the process vanishes . for @xmath46 , instead , after a non - universal transient , the average magnetization @xmath44 grows in time as @xmath47 for @xmath48 whereas , for @xmath49 , @xmath44 decays algebraically to zero as @xmath50 .",
    "these different time dependences are characterized by the universal exponents @xmath51 ( the so - called initial - slip exponent  @xcite ) and @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath6 are the usual static and dynamic ( equilibrium ) critical exponents , respectively . in ref .",

    "on the basis of a renormalization - group analysis of the dynamics of the order parameter up to the first order in the dimensional expansion and of monte carlo simulations of the two - dimensional ising model with glauber dynamics , we concluded that the two exponents @xmath59 and @xmath60 are indeed different , with @xmath61 .    in the present study , we investigate both analytically and numerically the interplay between the crossovers described by eqs .",

    "<S> we investigate the persistence properties of critical @xmath0-dimensional systems relaxing from an initial state with non - vanishing order parameter ( _ e.g. _ , the magnetization in the ising model ) , focusing on the dynamics of the global order parameter of a @xmath1-dimensional manifold . </S>",
    "<S> the persistence probability @xmath2 shows three distinct long - time decays depending on the value of the parameter @xmath3 which also controls the relaxation of the persistence probability in the case of a disordered initial state ( vanishing order parameter ) as a function of the codimension @xmath4 and of the critical exponents @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath2 is exponential for @xmath7 , stretched exponential for @xmath8 , and algebraic for @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> whereas the exponential and stretched exponential relaxations are not affected by the initial value of the order parameter , we predict and observe a crossover between two different power - law decays when the algebraic relaxation occurs , as in the case @xmath10 of the global order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm via monte carlo simulations our analytical predictions by studying the magnetization of a line and of a plane of the two- and three - dimensional ising model , respectively , with glauber dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the measured exponents of the ultimate algebraic decays are in a rather good agreement with our analytical predictions for the ising universality class . in spite of this agreement , </S>",
    "<S> the expected scaling behavior of the persistence probability as a function of time and of the initial value of the order parameter remains problematic . in this context , the non - equilibrium dynamics of the @xmath11 model in the limit @xmath12 and its subtle connection with the spherical model is also discussed in detail . in particular , we show that the correlation functions of the components of the order parameter which are respectively parallel and transverse to its average value within the @xmath13 model correspond to the correlation functions of the local and global order parameter of the spherical model . </S>"
