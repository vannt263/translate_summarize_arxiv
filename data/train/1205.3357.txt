    "one of the goals of the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collision experiments at bnl rhic and at cern lhc is to produce a deconfined state of qcd matter commonly known as quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the properties of such a system , if formed , can be studied through various probes such as electromagnetic probe , jet quenching etc .. according to qcd thermodynamics studied on lattice , this novel state of matter is expected to be formed at temperatures of the order of @xmath0mev . the jet of particles produced initially due to hard collision , when passes through such a system loses energy and results in decrease of high energy hadrons produced due to the jet fragmentation .",
    "this phenomenon is commonly known as jet quenching . moreover",
    ", the passage of jets influences the collective modes of the system  @xcite .",
    "the effect of single jet propagation on the plasma collective modes has been studied in refs  @xcite where it has been assumed that the plasma is isotropic in momentum space and the jet is described by a tsunami - like jet distribution . in a very recent",
    "work the present authors have relaxed the condition of isotropic qgp and studied the characteristics of both stable and unstable collective modes of aqgp due to the passage of relativistic jet using transport theory  @xcite .",
    "it is shown  @xcite that the dispersion relations are modified quite substantially in comparison to the no jet case .",
    "on the other hand , the authors of ref  @xcite , have investigated the dijet induced properties of the unstable modes in isotropic qgp .",
    "also the energy loss due to stream instabilities induced by dijet has been discussed using both tsunami - like and gaussian distributions for the relativistic jets within the same approach as in refs .",
    "we extend the work of ref .",
    "@xcite to aqgp and study the characteristics of both stable and unstable modes due to the passage of two jets moving in opposite direction .",
    "it should be noted that non - equilibrium jet of particles while travelling through qgp disturbs the plasma exciting chromomagnetic and chromoelectric modes of which some of modes might even be unstable .",
    "the most important among those are the modes which grow exponentially in time .",
    "plasma instabilities due to jet propagation in aqgp have been the subject of extensive studies as when the instability occurs , the kinetic energy of the particles is converted to the field energy leading to faster isotropization  @xcite of the qgp .",
    "this type of phenomenon occurs if it is assumed that the the hadronization time is greater than the time to generate the growth of the gauge fields . for the complete development of plasma instabilities ,",
    "the time scale should be of the order of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the total angular frequency of the whole system  @xcite .",
    "we use the same simplifying assumptions as in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the stable and unstable modes of aqgp induced by two counter propagating jets and compare it with that obtained in case of single jet  @xcite and no jet case  @xcite .",
    "aqgp is realized in the very early stages of heavy - ion collision due to rapid longitudinal expansion . as a consequence ,",
    "the cooling is faster in the longitudinal direction which results in @xmath3 .",
    "such momentum - space anisotropy modifies the collective modes which have different behavior in comparison to that in isotropic qgp ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) . due to the passage of relativistic jets in a non - equilibrium plasma , with an anisotropic distribution in momentum space , the behavior of collective modes change as will be demonstrated in the following .",
    "the essential ingredient to study the collective modes in the composite system ( aqgp+jets ) is the transport equation which reduces to vlasov equations for the time scale shorter than the mean free path time  @xcite . in our calculation",
    "we assume ( i ) weak coupling regime i.e. @xmath4 and ( ii ) the interactions between jet and plasma is only mediated by mean gauge fields .",
    "the interactions between the jet particles and the plasma particles leads kinetic instability initiated either by charge or current fluctuations which lead to electric and magnetic instabilities .",
    "the latter is also known as weibel instability  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the growth rate of magnetic instability is maximum in the direction of anisotropy in momentum - space anisotropic plasma . so while studying the characteristics of the unstable modes we assume that the momentum of the collective mode is in the direction of the anisotropy .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we mention the required formalism very briefly as detail has already been presented in @xcite . in section 3 results for both stable and unstable modes will be presented followed by summary in section 4 .",
    "to study the jet induced collective modes in aqgp we dwell on the transport theory described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of simplicity , we assume two jets propagating in opposite direction described by the following tsunami - like distribution  @xcite f_jet(*p*)=|n|u^0^(3)(*p*-).[td ] here @xmath5 is related to the density of the plasma and @xmath6 is the four - velocity .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 fixes the scale of energy of the particles .",
    "more realistic distribution , such as , a gaussian distribution can be used to simulate the same effect  @xcite .    using vlasov approximation",
    "one can write down the polarization tensor for particles species @xmath8 as  @xcite : ^_(k)=g^2_p p^ ( g^-)[dt ] where @xmath8 specify the quarks , antiquarks , gluons or partials of jet .",
    "the polarization tensor is symmetric , i. e. @xmath9 , and transverse , @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that the ansatz for the anisotropic momentum distribution is given by  @xcite : f(*p*)=f_(*p*)=n()f_iso ( ) . here",
    "@xmath11 is the distribution function in isotropic case .",
    "@xmath12 is the normalization constant which is equal to @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the unit vector along the direction of anisotropy .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath15 lies in the range @xmath16 . using the above ansatz the spacelike component of the self - energy tensor can be written as ( from eq.([dt ] ) ) : ^ij_p(k)=m_d^2 ( ^jl+ ) where m_d^2=-^_0dpp^2 is the isotropic debye mass . since the self energy depends on the four - momentum(@xmath17 ) and",
    "the the anisotropic vector @xmath18 , it can be decomposed in a suitable tensorial form in a covariant gauge  @xcite : ^ij_p(k)=a^ij+b^ij+c^ij+d^ij where a^ij&=&^ij - k^ik^j/*k^2*,[s1 ] + b^ij&=&k^ik^j/*k^2*,[s2 ] + c^ij&=&^i^j/^2,[s3 ] + d^ij&=&k^i^j+k^j^i,[s4 ] where @xmath19 which obeys @xmath20 and the structure functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be obtained by appropriate contractions ( see @xcite for details ) . in the limit of @xmath23 ( isotropic case ) @xmath24 and @xmath22 vanish whereas , @xmath8 and @xmath25 are directly related to the transverse and longitudinal components of the polarization tensor of the plasma respectively .    in a similar way",
    ", the polarization tensors induced by the jets ( moving in opposite direction ) with the tsunami - like momentum distribution can be calculated to obtain the following expressions  @xcite : ^ij_jet1(k)=-^2_jet(^ij + - ) , + ^ij_jet2(k)=-^2_jet(^ij- - ) , + where @xmath26 is the velocity of jet and @xmath27 is the plasma frequency of the jet . moreover",
    ", the polarization tensors due to the jets can be decomposed in the following way : ^ij_jet  1 = ^a^ij + ^b^ij ^ij_jet  2 = ^a^ij + ^b^ij where ^&=&-[2-v^2 ^ 2_jet ] + ^&=&^2_jet^2 and ^&=&-[2-v^2 ^ 2_jet ] + ^&=&^2_jet^2 . for numerical convenience ,",
    "we introduce another parameter @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 .    in the analysis of the collective modes of the composite system we are interested in very short time",
    "scales where the collisionless approximation is justified .",
    "the effect of jet of particle is to induce the color fluctuations , which provide a contribution to the polarization tensor of the system . according to the linear response theory , the total polarization tensor of the whole system is given by the sum of polarization tensors of the plasma and the two jets .",
    "thus we have , ^_t(k)=^_p(k)+^_jet1(k)+^_jet2(k)[pit ] the dispersion relation of the collective modes of the total system can be determined by solving the equation [ ( k^2-^2)^ij - k^ik^j+^ij_t(k)]=det[^-1(k)]^ij=0.[dr ] where , in the temporal axial gauge , the effective propagator @xmath31 is given by , ^ij(k)=.[pole ] therefore , using eqs.(6 ) , ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) , and ( 17 ) the effective propagator of the composite system can be written as ( k)&=&_a*a*+(*k*^2-^2++ ^+^+)_g*b * + & + & [ ( + ^+^- ^2)_g-_a]*c*-_g*d * with ^-1_a & = & * k*^2-^2++ ^+^,[c1 ] + ^-1_g&=&(*k*^2-^2++^+ ^+)(+^+ ^-^2 ) + & -&*k*^2 ^ 2.[c2 ]",

    "it is also seen that for fixed @xmath15 and @xmath41 the dijet results differ substantially from the single jet case .",
    "we also find marginal dependence of @xmath45-modes on @xmath40 at very low momentum(see fig.[fig6 ] ) . in fig.[fig7 ] the sensitivity of the dispersion relation of the @xmath45-modes with the anisotropy direction ( @xmath41 ) has been displayed .",
    "it is found that the stable @xmath45-modes are quite sensitive to @xmath41 .",
    "it is also observed that the dijet results are quite different from the single jet case which is an important finding in the present work .",
    "we have also found that as in the case of single jet , dijet results are not that sensitive to the jet velocity ( see fig.[fig8 ] ) .",
    "finally , for stable modes , we consider the @xmath47-modes which have been shown in fig.[fig9 ] for @xmath48 , @xmath39 , @xmath49 , @xmath37 and @xmath50 with and without jets .",
    "we find significant difference in the collective modes between single jet and dijet .",
    "the @xmath51-dependence of the @xmath47-modes for @xmath52 is displayed in fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "it is seen that the dispersion relation for @xmath47-mode is more sensitive to @xmath40 which is not the case for @xmath33 and @xmath45-modes , the dispersion relation for @xmath47-modes for various @xmath41 is plotted in fig.[fig11 ] .",
    "we find significant dependencies on @xmath41 .",
    "the collective mode for @xmath47-mode is also marginally sensitive to the jet velocity(see fig.[fig12 ] ) .      in the static limit , for small @xmath41",
    "some of the scales appearing in the dispersion relations are negative implying that the whole system is unstable with respect to magnetic instability  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that in case of @xmath53 , the growth rate of the filamentation instabilities is the largest  @xcite . in such case @xmath24 and @xmath43",
    "vanish identically and the dispersion relations ( henceforth called @xmath8 and @xmath25 modes ) for the unstable modes simplify to ^2-*k*^2-()-^()-^()&=&0 + ^2-()-^()-^()&=&0 in the numerical solutions of the above equations we have checked that unstable mode exits only for @xmath8 mode both for single jet  @xcite and dijet .",
    "let us now concentrate on the dispersion relations for the unstable @xmath8 mode for which we shall , first assume that @xmath49 .",

    "this is depicted in fig.[figu1 ] .",
    "the growth of the instability in case of dijet is more compared to the single jet case for a fixed value of the anisotropy parameter .",

    "the roots of the dispersion relations are of the form of @xmath58 , i. e. these are unstable propagating modes .",
    "this has been checked numerically .",
    "the results for the unstable modes with non - zero @xmath51 is delineated in fig.[figu2 ] . both for single jet and dijet .",
    "for @xmath59 the results are similar to the case of @xmath60 . however , for @xmath61 , the instability always grows for dijet case as well as in the case of single jet which has already been reported  @xcite . in this case",
    "the modes never become damped .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that the dijet induced instability for @xmath62 is more compared to the single jet case .",
    "the dispersion relations of both stable and unstable collective modes in aqgp due to the dijet propagation have been obtained and solved numerically .",
    "we then compare it with that obtained in case of single jet and no jet cases .",
    "depending upon the values of different parameters and for the dijet case considered here , the stable modes differ significantly from that obtained with single jet .",
    "we have shown the dependencies of the dispersion relations ( both for single and dijet ) on various parameters explained in the text .",
    "it has been observed that the dispersion relation for stable modes are very sensitive to the anisotropy parameter , the anisotropy direction and the jet direction with respect to the wave vector . for the unstable modes it is found",
    "that the growth rate with dijet is more compared to the single jet case . in particular , for @xmath63 ,",
    "the growth rate for the dijet case is substantially larger and it always grows like the single jet case  @xcite .",
    "thus the introduction of dijet might lead to faster isotropization as compared to the single jet case .",
    "for the special case considered here ( @xmath64 ) no unstable modes exits for @xmath25-mode even with the dijet .",
