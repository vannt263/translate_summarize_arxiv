    "we have studied the emission in the fireshell model of grb 090618 , which is one of the closest ( @xmath1 ) and the most energetic ( @xmath2 erg ) grbs .",
    "it has been observed by many satellites , namely fermi , swift , konus - wind , agile , rt-2 and suzaku .",
    "we have analyzed the emission of this grb first identifying the transparency emission , the p - grb , and then using different spectral models with xspec .",
    "the fundamental parameters to be determined in the fireshell model , @xcite , in order to obtain information on the spectral energy emission , are the dyadosphere energy , the baryon loading and the density and porosity of the cbm .",
    "we found that in this grb there exists two different components .",
    "the first component lasts 50 s with a spectrum showing a very clear thermal component evolving , between @xmath3 kev and @xmath4 kev , and a radius increasing between 9000 km and 50000 km , with an estimate mass of @xmath5 10 m@xmath6 .",
    "the second component is a canonical long grb with a lorentz gamma factor at the transparency of @xmath7 = 490 , a temperature at transparency of 25.48 kev and with a characteristic size of the cbm cloud of @xmath8 cm which generated the observed luminosity .",
    "we confirm that the second episode corresponds to a canonical grb , while the first episode do not . indeed",
    ", it appears to be related to the progenitor of the collapsing bare core  defined by us as the  proto black hole ",
    "( izzo et al .",
    "a@xmath9a submitted )  leading to the black hole formation .      within the fireshell scenario ,",
    "all grbs originate from an optically thick @xmath10 plasma in thermal equilibrium , as a result of a gravitational collapse to form a black hole .",
    "this plasma has a total energy of @xmath11 .",
    "the annihilation of @xmath10 pairs occurs gradually and is confined in an expanding shell called  fireshell  .",
    "this plasma engulfs the baryonic material ( of mass @xmath12 ) left over in the process of gravitational collapse .",
    "the baryon loading is measured by the dimensionless parameter @xmath13 .",
    "the fireshell self - accelerates to ultra - relativistic velocities until it reaches the transparency , when all the photons are emitted in what is called the p - grb .",
    "the remaining accelerated baryonic matter starts then to slow down due to the collisions with the circum burst medium ( cbm ) , of average density @xmath14 .",
    "this collision between baryons and the cbm will give rise to the extended afterglow emission , which represents the residual high - energy emission observed in grbs .",
    "we made use of swift - bat and xrt @xcite data , together with the fermi - gbm @xcite and coronas photon - rt2 @xcite ones .",
    "the data reduction was done using the heasoft packages @xcite for bat and xrt , plus the fermi - science tools for gbm .",
    "the swift - bat light curve was obtained in the band ( 15- 150 kev ) using the standard procedure .",
    "the fermi - gbm light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "a detailed spectral analysis of the first episode showed a strong spectral evolution , see table [ tab:2 ] , where we have taken into account two different models , a band model and a blackbody plus an extra power - law component , in order to explain this first emission episode .",
    "we have seen , in the case of the black body plus power - law , that the temperature varies from the initial value of 54 kev to 14 kev , where the extra power - law non - thermal component is assumed to be related to the blackbody by some process which will be studied in the future . assuming a non - relativistic expansion for this first episode",
    ", we computed the evolution of the blackbody radius just from the luminosity observed : @xmath15^{1/2 } d}{(1+z)^2}.\\ ] ] , where @xmath16 is the observed thermal flux , @xmath17 the stefan constant and @xmath18 the luminosity distance .",
    "we have also obtained a lower limit estimate of the mass of the proto - black hole by considering the sole blackbody energy emitted in the first episode , given by the thermal luminosity times the emission time , and its origin as due to the gravitational energy : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total isotropic energy of the event , @xmath21 is the time duration of the first episode in the rest frame and @xmath22 denotes the proto - black hole mass .",
    "we then obtained @xmath23 as a lower limit for proto - black hole mass .",
    "the physical explanation for the proto - black hole emission is to be attributed to the processes of shells mixing that happen in the last stages of the final collapse of a very massive star @xcite .",
    "full details on the observational and theoretical evidences of the double episodes nature of grb 090618 can be found in izzo et al . , a&a submitted ."
