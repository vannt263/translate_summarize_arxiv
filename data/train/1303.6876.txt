    "bilayer graphene ( blg ) is a system consisting of two bernal@xcite stacked graphene monolayers@xcite . whereas monolayer graphene has a linear electronic spectrum in the vicinity of each corner of the brillouin zone ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 points , also known as",
    "_ dirac points _ ) , bilayer graphene has four hyperbolic bands .",
    "two of these bands touch in the @xmath5 point at zero energy making blg a gapless semiconductor , the other two bands are displaced by an energy of @xmath6 with respect to the touching bands@xcite .",
    "the application of a potential that breaks the interlayer symmetry can however create a tunable bandgap@xcite .",
    "often , a low energy approximation@xcite is made that is valid for electron kinetic energy much smaller than the interlayer hopping parameter @xmath7 .",
    "this so called two band approximation has a quadratic dispersion and is only valid near the dirac point .    in monolayer graphene klein tunneling results in a 100% probability for perpendicular transmission through potential barriers , as predicted@xcite and observed experimentally@xcite . for bilayer graphene due to the conservation of pseudospin ,",
    "no klein tunneling is expected and this was confirmed theoretically within the two band approximation@xcite . in this case",
    "there are electronic states available that are not accessible for penetration into the potential barrier , which was called a _ cloaking _ of those states@xcite .",
    "previous work was based on the two band approximation which we extend here to the four band model .",
    "this allows us to investigate the electronic properties at higher fermi level , i.e. beyond @xmath7 , and for a higher electrostatic potential .",
    "recent experimental progress has allowed to access this energy region and measurements of the electronic transport in this region is expected@xcite .",
    "we calculate the transmission and reflection probabilities within the same band and between the two bands for electrons impinging on a rectangular potential barrier ( pnp - junction ) and a potential step ( pn - junction ) at different angles of incidence and investigate the effect of the application of an interlayer bias to the transport properties .",
    "furthermore we compare the energy dependence of the conductance calculated within the two band and the four band model and point out major differences .",
    "our findings show that at low energy and low potential the same phenomena occur as those predicted by the two band model and that the existence of pseudospin is related to the ( anti)symmetry of the wavefunctions .",
    "this relation is a consequence of the symmetry of the crystal and is therefore also valid when the skew hopping parameters are taken into account . outside the range of validity of the two band approximation",
    "however , we predict several new phenomena : 1 ) for high potential barriers new resonances are found that are absent in the two band model ; 2 ) the use of four bands introduces a new mode of propagation ; 3 ) we investigate a new form of cloaking and calculate the scattering between the two modes of propagation ; and 4 ) the newly discovered resonances and the second mode of propagation lead to distinctive features in the conductance that are absent in the two band calculation .",
    "we also justify the use of only the nearest neighbor interlayer hopping parameters .",
    "finally , we show that the application of an interlayer bias not only opens a bandgap and therefore suppresses the transmission in this region , it also unexpectedly breaks the angular symmetry with respect to normal incidence when only one valley is considered .",
    "the paper at hand is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : propmodes ] we present the formalism , indicate the different propagating modes , define the eight different transmission and reflection probabilities for the four band model and explain the transition from the four band to the two band model at low energy .",

    "[ timesymmetry ] we analyze the symmetries of the system to explain the transmission for normal incidence and the surprising occurrence of angular asymmetry at non normal incidence the numerical results for the conductance , transmission and reflection at non normal incidence for pn - junctions and potential barriers with and without interlayer bias are discussed in sec .",

    "[ conclusion ] we summarize the main points of this paper .",
    "in this section we discuss the dispersion relation of blg and the resulting propagating modes .",
    "it turns out that electrons in blg can propagate via two different modes and we find that when electrons impinge perpendicular on a potential barrier , it is not possible to scatter between those modes .",
    "we model the blg crystal as two hexagonal monolayer flakes with in plane interatomic distance@xcite @xmath8 nm , each consisting of two nonequivalent sublattices with atoms @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the top layer and @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the bottom one .",

    "we find new phenomena such as transmission resonances at normal incidence .",
    "we showed that the notion of pseudospin used to describe electrons in the two band approximation corresponds to the wavefunctions being symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to in - plane mirroring and that this leads to the observation of _ cloaking _ which occurs both for symmetric and antisymmetric states .",

    "a new mode of propagation is available for the electrons , which is not present in the two band approximation , and we found that for non normal incidence it is possible to scatter between the two modes .",
    "the resulting conductance of the four band model incorporates these new phenomena and therefore differs significantly from the conductance calculated within the two band model .",
    "this difference manifests itself by the presence of many more and well defined resonances and a substantially higher conductance for high energies .",
    "finally , we showed that the application of an interlayer bias in the system significantly changes the transmission characteristics .",
    "the bandgap created by the interlayer potential forms a distinct feature in the conductance and the transmission and reflection probabilities lack reflection symmetry due to normal incidence .",
