    "one of the central goals in contemporary observational cosmology is to detect the postulated background of primordial gravity waves predicted by inflation .",
    "the most direct observational signature of these gravity waves is a particular pattern in the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) known as b - modes .",
    "the amplitude of these gravity waves is typically parametrized in terms of the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath6 ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein for a thorough review on inflation ) . during the last few years",
    "many experiments have been planned , built and fielded to measure @xmath6 , and the first relevant b - mode constraints have been already published by bicep ( @xmath7 , chiang et al .",
    "2010 ) and quiet ( @xmath8 ; quiet 2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "other ground - based and sub - orbital experiments are expected to vastly improve on these limits in the very near future .    in order to make an actual detection of the inflationary gravity waves",
    ", it is widely believed that a sensitivity of @xmath9 will be required . in terms of map - domain sensitivity",
    ", this corresponds to a signal with an rms of a few tens of nk .",
    "thus , not only will exquisitely sensitive detectors be needed , but also detectors with extremely low systematics .",
    "however , the single most problematic systematic for future b - mode experiments is likely not to come from the instrument itself , but rather from the sky : non - cosmological galactic and extra - galactic foregrounds , for instance synchrotron and thermal dust , radiates with a temperature of several @xmath10 on large angular scales in the frequencies relevant for cmb measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , in order not to be foreground dominated , these foregrounds must very likely be suppressed by perhaps an order of magnitude or more . the only way to achieve this is by making multifrequency observations of the same fields of the sky , and",
    "exploit the different frequency dependency of the various components to separate out the cosmological cmb signal from the non - cosmological foregrounds .    as of today",
    ", a very large fraction of the information we have about polarized foregrounds on large angular scales comes from the wmap satellite experiment , and in particular the lowest frequency channel at 23 ghz ( k - band ) .",
    "this map is routinely used both for studies of foregrounds themselves , and as ancillary data for other experiments .",
    "it is therefore critical to understand the systematic limitations inherent in these data . in this paper",
    "we measure the spectral indices of four particularly bright compact objects ( tau a , virgo a , 3c273 and fornax a ) , with the goal of understanding some of the issued involved in spectral index estimation for cmb data in general : by considering high signal - to - noise objects with known properties , we have a clear a - priori prediction , and deviations from these expectations would indicate either model problems or systematic errors .",
    "[ [ sky - maps - and - processing ] ] sky maps and processing + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper we consider the 7-year wmap sky maps @xcite , coadded over years and pixelized at a healpix resolution of @xmath11 , corresponding to @xmath12 pixels .",
    "these data are available from lambda , including all necessary ancillary data , such as beam profiles and noise model .",
    "most of our analysis is performed with the k- and ka - band data , although in one particular case we also consider the q - band data .",
    "all analyses are carried out in antenna temperature units , and given that we will consider objects with steep synchrotron - like spectra we adopt effective frequencies of 22.45 ghz ( k - band ) , 32.64 ghz ( ka - band ) and 40.50 ghz ( q - band ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "before one can estimate spectral indices across frequencies , it is necessary to bring all maps to a common angular resolution .",
    "we therefore smooth all maps to an effective resolution of @xmath0 fwhm by first deconvolving the instrument beam and then convolving with a gaussian beam of the desired size .",
    "note that the smoothing scale of @xmath0 is a particularly common value adopted in the literature , and the results presented here are therefore of wide interest .",
    "estimation of uncertainties for all scalar quantities is done by forward monte carlo simulations .",
    "that is , we add smoothed noise realizations to the actual wmap data based on the provided noise model , evaluate each statistic for each simulation , and then compute the resulting standard deviation over the ensemble .",
    "although there already is a noise component present in the wmap data , this is identical for all simulations , and therefore do not contribute to the variance .",
    "we emphasize , though , that uncertainties estimated in this manner are only statistical in nature , and do not account for systematic errors .",
    "[ [ data - selection ] ] data selection + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this paper we consider the four particularly bright point sources listed in table [ tab : image ] .",
    "these were selected by thresholding the k - band polarization map , @xmath13 , at @xmath14 , and discarding all regions that either show obviously extended features or have a strong background .",
    "this left us with tau a as the only near - galactic source , and three high - latitude sources ( virgo a , 3c273 and fornax a ) .",
    "for further details on the polarization properties of these objects , see , e.g. , @xcite .    only pixels in a @xmath0 radius disc around each source",
    "were kept for analysis , although we also tried @xmath15 discs , obtaining consistent , but slightly more noisy , results .",
    "note that a gaussian beam of @xmath0 fwhm ( @xmath16 ) has dropped off to 6% of its peak value at a distance of @xmath0 , and most of the volume is therefore contained within this radius .",

    "further , they are all known to be much smaller than @xmath0 in angular dimensions ( see table [ tab : image ] for precise details ) , and their polarization angles are known to be quite stable as a function of frequency .",
    "( for example , the polarization angle of tau a is known to vary by only a few degrees over more than 10 decades in frequency ; e.g. , aumont et al . 2010 . )",
    "we therefore assume that there is no real substructure within each source on the scales we consider .",

    "an additional advantage of this method is its insensitivity to absolute offsets in the data .",
    "the spectral index is given as @xmath85 .",
    "since both @xmath83 and @xmath84 have uncertainties , it is important to use a method that supports uncertainties in both directions with making the linear fit . in this paper",

    "we therefore add a systematic error term in quadrature to the statistical error .",
    "the systematic error is defined by splitting the observed data points in two sets , according to whether @xmath83 is larger or smaller than @xmath110 , and estimate a new slope for each set .",
    "the systematic error is taken to be the half difference between the two slopes .",
    "in table [ tab : image ] we list the position and apparent ( beam - convolved ) size and shape of each of the four objects under consideration . the polarization fraction and angles , and spectral indices",

    "images of tau a are shown in figure [ fig : objects ] , both for k- ( left column ) and ka - band ( right column ) , and for stokes @xmath21 and @xmath22 parameters . in order to highlight the beam differences between these cases ,",
    "we have first adopted a coordinate system which is offset by @xmath111 from the intrinsic polarization direction of tau a. this ensures a significant signal - to - noise in both @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "second , the color scale is tuned to highlight the tails of the instrumental beam , and scaled properly between the two frequencies taking into account the spectral index of tau a.    the main results of this paper are shown in figures [ fig : beam_vs_psi ] and [ fig : beta_vs_psi ] . the first figure shows the beam parameters for tau a as a function of polarization orientation , and the second shows the spectral index as a function of polarization direction for all four sources . in the latter , the black points indicate the spectral index computed from k- and ka - bands , and ( for tau a only ) the red points show the spectral index between ka- and q - band . figure [ fig : indfit ] shows a subset of the tau a tt plots that are used for the k - ka calculations , corresponding to @xmath3 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively .    as seen from the results shown in figure [ fig : beta_vs_psi ] ,",
    "the polarized spectral index as measured by wmap between k- and ka - band at @xmath0 angular scale depends strongly on the coordinate system in which the index is computed .",
    "for tau a , the derived index varies between , say , @xmath114 for a rotation angle of @xmath3 and @xmath115 for @xmath5 .",
    "this effect is statistically highly significant , and it is robust with respect to instrumental noise and background levels ( see figure [ fig : indfit ] ) .",
    "it therefore indicates the presence of a real systematic effect not taken into account in the present analysis .    to understand these structures in greater detail , we construct an elliptical gaussian model of tau a based on the parameters listed in tables [ tab : image ] and [ tab : polarization ] at k- and ka - band , and estimate the spectral index from the resulting noiseless model , as for the real data .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : beta_vs_psi_sim ] .",
    "clearly , the model faithfully reproduces the observed structures .",
    "the only difference is a slight vertical offset , which is due to the fact that the measured spectral index ( reported in table [ tab : polarization ] ) is not a perfectly unbiased estimate of the true spectral index in the presence of systematics .",
    "we can now use this model to understand the relative importance of the various systematic effects . to do so , we start out with an ideal model , adopting the observed k - band parameters also for ka - band , and set the ka parameters one - by - one to their true values . the results from this exercise are shown in figure [ fig : beta_vs_psi_systematics ] . here",
    "we see that the most important systematic by far is the detector angle , and this effect alone reproduces the signal seen in figure [ fig : beta_vs_psi_sim ] very well .",
    "the second most important effect is the beam ellipticity , which is at least three to four times smaller than the detector angle effect over most of the well - sampled regions of the polarization orientation .",
    "other effects are small compared to these two .",
    "we have studied four particularly bright polarized point sources in the 7-year wmap data , with the goal of understanding the effect of systematics on polarized spectral index estimation .",
    "this topic is important for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the wmap polarization sky maps represents the best currently available full - sky measurements of the polarized foregrounds at cmb frequencies . as a result",
    ", they play a critical role in the analysis and optimization of existing and future b - mode experiments .",
    "second , many ground - based and sub - orbital experiments use the wmap polarization measurements of tau a directly as a calibration source for both detector angles and absolute gain .    in this paper",
    ", we have found that the observed polarized spectral index of the relevant sources depends sensitively on the coordinate system in which the index is estimated .",
    "for example , the spectral index of tau a is @xmath2 for a coordinate system rotated by @xmath116 relative to the intrinsic polarization direction of the source , while it is @xmath4 in a coordinate system rotated by @xmath112 .",
    "the most significant contributor to this effect is the slightly different polarization angles of the k- and ka - band detectors , with some smaller contribution coming from beam asymmetries .",
    "experiments that , directly or indirectly , use the k- and ka - band measurements of tau a as a calibrator source should take into account these systematic uncertainties when performing their analyses .    finally , we note that the test described in this paper is very simple to implement , only takes a few cpu seconds to run , and have a very direct and intuitive interpretation",
    ". we therefore expect other experiments to find it useful as a test of their own systematics , in particular when applied to tau a.    this project was supported by the erc starting grant stg2010 - 257080 and a leverhulme visiting professorship for hke .",
