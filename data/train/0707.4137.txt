    "with a branching ratio of @xmath5% the @xmath1 decay is a major decay mode of the @xmath6 despite the fact that is a g  parity forbidden transition .",
    "neglecting a small electromagnetic transition ( sutherland s theorem @xcite ) this decay is due almost exclusively to the isospin breaking part of qcd : @xmath7 and provides a nice way to determine the up - down quark mass difference .",
    "+ many theoretical issues @xcite , @xcite refer to the study of the charged and neutral decay mode of @xmath8 , and in particular to the dalitz plot parameters of these decays .",
    "+ the dalitz plot distribution of the @xmath1 decay is conventionally described in terms of one kinematical variable : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the energy of the i - th pion in the @xmath6 rest frame and @xmath11 is the distance from a point on the dalitz plot to its center .",
    "@xmath12 is the maximum value of @xmath11 . for the decays into three identical particles",
    ", it is possible to use a symmetrical dalitz plot where the event density is described by a single quadratic slope parameter @xmath0 , which represents the difference from pure phase space : @xmath13 the lowest order predictions of chiral pertubation theory quote a zero value for @xmath0 . the event density in the dalitz plot must be uniform .",
    "a non zero value is instead expected by dispersive calculation @xcite where the effect of @xmath14 rescattering is included . lately a theoretical result @xcite , obtained in the chiral unitary approach based on the bethe  salpter equation , provide for @xmath0 the value @xmath15 .",
    "there are three previous experimental determination of @xmath0 : the gams 2000 group @xcite quoted @xmath16 based on @xmath17 events ; the crystall barrel collaboration obtained @xmath18 from a sample of @xmath19 events and finally the crystal ball @xcite result , @xmath20 based on @xmath21 events .",
    "this was the first statistically significant measurement of @xmath0 which agree very well with the most recent theoretical result . in this paper",
    "we report on a new precise measurement of the dalitz plot parameter for the @xmath1 decay .",
    "the da@xmath2ne e@xmath22e@xmath23 collider operates at a total energy w = 1020 mev , the mass of the @xmath24(1020)meson .",
    "approximately @xmath25 @xmath24mesons are produced for each pb@xmath3 of collected luminosity . since 2001",
    ", kloe has integrated a total luminosity of about 2.5 fb@xmath3 .",

    "the kloe detector consists of a large cylindrical drift chamber , dc , surrounded by a lead / scintillating - fiber electromagnetic calorimeter , emc .",

    "only the electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) signals have been used .",
    "two local energy deposits above threshold , @xmath31 mev for the barrel and @xmath32 mev for the endcaps , are required .",
    "at kloe the @xmath6 meson is produced in the process @xmath34 where the recoil photon ( @xmath35 is monochromatic and easily selected .",
    "thus to select the final state we require to have seven prompt clusters in the event . after applying a kinematic fit , which requires the energy - momentum conservation , we look for the best pairing of photons into @xmath36 by constructing a pseudo@xmath37 variable for each of the @xmath38 possible pairs : + @xmath39 where    * @xmath40 is the invariant mass of the @xmath41 , in correspondence of the @xmath42 combination ; * @xmath43 is the @xmath44 mass , ( @xmath43 = 134.98 mev / c@xmath45 @xcite ) ; * @xmath46 is the resolution on @xmath47 .",
    "the chosen pair is that one which minimize the @xmath37 .",
    "a second kinematic fit constraining the @xmath36 mass has been performed , improving the resolution on @xmath48 by a factor two .",
    "the monte carlo , mc , @xmath48 distribution at generation ( pure phase space ) , see fig.[fig : dalitzplot ] and after reconstruction , see fig.[fig : dalitzplot1 ] , shows that resolution effects are not negligible for this analysis .",
    "three samples with different efficiency , @xmath49 and purity on pairing , @xmath50 : @xmath51 have been analyzed by cutting on the difference of the two lowest value of @xmath37 .",
    "in order to estimate @xmath0 an unbinned likelihood function is built by convoluting the event density with the resolution function and correcting for the probability of wrong photon pairing in @xmath36 s . using a sample with high purity and fitting in the range @xmath52",
    ", we found the preliminary result@xcite : @xmath53 where the systematics has been evaluated by varying the analysis cuts , the fit range and measuring the maximum observed variation of @xmath0 with respect to the samples with different purity .",
