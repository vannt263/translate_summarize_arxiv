    "microfluidic devices like bio - mems ( micro - electronical - mechanical - systems ) and bio - nems ( nano - electronical - mechanical - systems ) are attracting growing interest due to their huge potential in bio- and nanotechnology , _",
    "e.g. _ , for analyzing and manipulating tiny samples . due to the large surface - to - volume ratios in nanoconfined systems , the flow in such devices is strongly influenced by the specific properties of the boundaries , _",
    "i.e. _ , by surface characteristics like the wetting behavior and/or slippage .",
    "if electric fields are involved , one particularly important mechanism is electroosmotic transport : in contact with a liquid , many materials commonly used in nanotechnology ( _ e.g. _ , polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) ) acquire surface charges due to the ionization of surface groups @xcite .",
    "surfaces are thus often covered by a compensating counterion layer @xcite .",
    "if one applies an external electric field , the ions are driven in one direction and drag the surrounding fluid along , thus creating the so - called electroosmotic flow ( eof ) .",
    "this electrokinetic effect has numerous consequences : it alters drastically the migration dynamics of mesoscopic objects like polyelectrolytes or colloids @xcite . in microchannels ,",
    "the eof generated at the channel walls induces a total net flow , which is technologically attractive because it can be controlled and manipulated more easily on the submicrometer scale than pressure- or shear - driven flow .",
    "one important application of microchannels is to use them for separating different fragments of biological molecules like dna by their length for sequencing or further manipulation . in free solution ,",
    "the electrophoretic mobility of high molecular weight polyelectrolytes is length independent @xcite .",
    "electrophoretic separation methods therefore often introduce the samples into micro- or nanostructured environments , _ e.g. _ , disordered gels ( in gel electrophoresis ) , or structured microchannels @xcite .",
    "the migration behavior of the molecules in such a setup results from a complex interplay of electrostatics , hydrodynamics , and confinement effects on the molecules , and modeling all of this in full detail is computationally challenging .",
    "fortunately , it turns out that due to a combination of subtle screening effects  which are not yet fully understood ",
    "simple implicit - solvent brownian dynamics simulations that altogether neglect electrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions give results that are in qualitative and semiquantitative agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such simplified treatments miss important and interesting physics , and simulations with explicit solvent and explicit charges are clearly desirable .    here",
    "we present such explicit simulations of eof and polyelectrolyte electrophoresis in nanochannels @xcite , using dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) @xcite , which is a popular mesoscopic simulation method .",
    "particular emphasis is put on the role of the channel boundaries , _",
    "i.e. _ , on the effect of slippage and the electrical double layer at the surface",
    ".    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : after some theoretical considerations , we describe the simulation model and method , with special focus on our method to implement variable hydrodynamic boundaries .",
    "then we discuss the results , first for the simpler situation of a charged channel which only contains counterions , and finally for the full problem ( electrolyte of varying ionic strength plus polyelectrolyte plus counterions ) .",
    "the results are compared with theory whereever possible .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary .",
    "we consider a planar slit channel with identical walls at @xmath3 , exposed to an external electric field @xmath4 in the @xmath5 direction .",
    "the electrostatic potential @xmath6 then takes the general form @xmath7 , where we can set @xmath8 for simplicity . comparing the poisson equation for the electrostatic potential @xmath9 with the stokes equation and exploiting the symmetry of the channel , one finds @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dielectric constant , @xmath12 the shear viscosity of the fluid , and @xmath13 is an integration constant .    on the nanoscale ,",
    "the appropriate hydrodynamic boundary condition at the channel walls is the partial - slip boundary condition @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the component of the velocity in x - direction evaluated at the position @xmath16 of an effective `` hydrodynamic boundary '' position , and the second effective parameter , the slip length @xmath0 , characterizes the amount of slippage at the surface .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : partial_slip ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : vx ] ) , we finally obtain the following simple expression for the electroosmotic mobility , @xmath17 where we have defined an inverse surface screening length @xcite @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the well - known smoluchowski result @xcite for the electroosmotic mobility at sticky walls @xmath20 . a similar result can be derived within the linearized debye - hckel theory with @xmath21 ( the debye - hckel length ) @xcite .",
    "we study fluids that are driven through planar slit channels in the @xmath5-direction by external fields , applying periodic boundaries in the @xmath5 and @xmath22 dimension and repulsive ( charged ) walls in the @xmath23 direction .",
    "the systems contained varying amounts of charged ions ( anions and cations ) , plus possibly a polyelectrolyte chain .",
    "they were thermalized by the momentum conserving dpd thermostat @xcite , where the forces acting on particles @xmath24 are given by a sum @xmath25 of standard conservative contributions @xmath26 , dissipative forces @xmath27 , and random forces",

    "we only use the dpd _ thermostat _ as described above .",
    "all simulations have been carried out with extensions of the freely available software package @xcite .",
    "all particles , solvent , ions , and chain monomers , are modeled explicitly , and have the same mass @xmath40 for simplicity . ions and monomers repel each other with a soft repulsive weeks - chandler - anderson ( wca ) potential @xcite of range @xmath41 and amplitude @xmath42 .",
    "the same potential acts between particles and the walls . in addition",
    ", chain monomers are connected by harmonic springs @xmath43 with the spring constant @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "neutral solvent particles have no conservative interactions except with the walls .",
    "the wall contains immobilized , negatively charged particles at random positions . every second monomer on the polyelectrolyte carries a negative charge .",
    "all charges are monovalent , and the system as a whole is electroneutral . charged particles interact with each other _ via _ a coulomb potential with the bjerrum length @xmath46 , and also with an external electric field @xmath47 .",
    "specifically , we show here results for systems with channel width @xmath48 and a surface charge density @xmath49 , which is found to correspond to the weak - coupling regime @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the regime where the poisson - boltzmann theory is valid .",
    "the total counterion density was roughly @xmath50 and the salt density varied between @xmath510.05625 , 0.0375 , 0.03 , 0.025 , and @xmath52 .",

    "the prefactor @xmath69 sets the strength of the friction force and hence determines the value of the slip length . with this approach it is possible to tune the slip length @xmath0 systematically from full - slip to no - slip and even ( small ) negative",
    "furthermore , one can use the stokes equation to derive an analytical expression for the slip length @xmath0 as a function of the model parameters , giving @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the gamma - function , @xmath72 the modified bessel function of the first kind , and the dimensionless parameter @xmath73 depends on the density @xmath59 and the shear viscosity @xmath12 of the fluid . to test this expression ,",
