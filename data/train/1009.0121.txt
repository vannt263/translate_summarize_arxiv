    "the goal of this paper is to provide a explicit description of the mechanism of the spectrum functor ; how we construct a topological space and a structure sheaf from an algebraic object , and why it behaves so nicely .    at first",
    ", we were only planning to give some definitions of schemes constructed from idempotent semirings motivated from the tropical geometry ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , since still there is no concrete definition of higher dimensional tropical varieties : in @xcite , mikhalkin is giving a definition , but is very complicated and not used in full strength yet , so we can not say that the definition is appropriate yet . also , the algebraic theories of semirings are still inadequate , compared to those of normal algebras , though there are already many demands from various workfields .",
    "even the tensor products has been constructed only recently ( cf . @xcite ) .",
    "so , we had to start from the beginning : giving a foundation of idempotent algebras .",
    "later , we noticed that there should be a comprehensive theory including the theory of schemes over @xmath0 , of which field is now in fashion ( cf .",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "we chose the definition of commutative idempotent monoid to be infinitely additive .",
    "there are two reasons .",
    "first , if we restrict our attention to finite additivity , then the existence of all adjoint functors are already assured , by the general theory of algebraic systems .",
    "secondly , we can handle topological spaces in this framework : a sober space can be regarded as a semiring with idempotent multiplication .",
    "also , we can make it clear how we obtain a infinite operation ( i.e. the intersection of closed subsets ) from algebras with only finitary operators .",
    "this fact shows that , there are adjoints between the three categories : that of algebraic complete idealic semirings , that of algebraic idealic schemes , and that of algebraic sober spaces : @xmath1 this indicates that , the genuine theme of algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry ( including schemes over @xmath0 ) is no longer the investigation of the link between the category of algebras and the category of topological spaces , but that of the link between the category of algebras and the category of idempotent semirings . roughly speaking",
    ", the whole workfield may be thought as contained in the tropical geometry , if you take the tropical geometry as a study of semirings .    after a while , we realized that there are strong resemblance between the theory of lattices and the argument in the first half of this article .",
    "we must admit that there are no new ideas contained in this article ; most of the techniques and theorems have been already established decades ago .",
    "therefore , readers who attempt to study in this workfield is strongly recommended to overlook the lattice theory ( for example ,  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however , we decided to contain definitions and propositions as self - contained as possible , since there seems to be some discrepancy of languages between each workfields , and one of the purpose of this paper is to introduce connections between the lattice theory , tropical geometry , and schemes over @xmath0 .",
    "we were irresolute for a while , of which definition of schemes would be the most general and natural one . for this , we decided to give the weakest ( in other words , the most general ) definition in which the global section functor @xmath2 becomes an adjoint .",
    "this clarifies the condition of which algebra could give a topological space endowed with a structure sheaf .    also , we know that we can further extend the arguments and constructions in this article by replacing commutative monoids with symmetric monoidal categories , but we dared not , for it would be too abstract for the present demands .     1 is a summary of algebras and complete algebras .",
    "the definition and arguments are all standard  in other words , preliminary  in the lattice theory . in  2 , we deal with @xmath3-modules , where @xmath3 is a complete semiring .",
    "the results can not be deduced from  1 , so we had to argue seperately . in  3 , we focus on congruence relations , which is important when considering localizations . in  4 we deal with topological spaces , defining the spectrum functor by an adjoint .",
    "this is also standard in the lattice theory .",
    " 5 may be the most valuable part , in which we define @xmath4-schemes , and define the spectrum functor ( not the same one of  4 , but also endows the structure sheaf to the underlying space ) as an adjoint .",
    "all the adjoints we have constructed are illustrated in the end of 5.3 .",
    "_ acknowledgements .",
    "_ we would like to thank professor moriwaki for giving me chances to work on this subject . also , the author is grateful to doctor ikoma , for giving useful advises and encouragements .      throughout this paper ,",

    "we fix a universe , and all sets and algebraic objects are elements of this universe . for any set @xmath5 , we denote the power set of @xmath5 by @xmath6 .",
