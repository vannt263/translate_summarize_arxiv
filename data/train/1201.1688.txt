    "these opposite tendencies balance each other to result in a constant amount of the pulling independent of the pumping .",
    "in other words , the gain saturation approximately leads to @xmath77 above the threshold while @xmath78 makes @xmath79 constant .    in the microlaser , on the other hand , the gain is oscillatory with @xmath80 so that we encounter the reduction of gain well above the threshold and the corresponding saturation of @xmath80 as a function of @xmath25 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : pumping2](a ) below ] .",
    "the pumping by the atomic flux @xmath25 is thus translated into the increase of the amount of pulling .",
    "the other pumping channel , the coupling constant @xmath23 , brings the mean photon number down when it is increased , and the corresponding variation of @xmath81 with respect to @xmath23 is rather small .",
    "thus @xmath82 behavior contained in @xmath75 term is dominant also in this case .",
    "the quadratic dependence comes from the feedback mechanism inherent in the laser amplification process , in which the atomic polarization induced by the cavity field via coupling @xmath23 drives the cavity field again by the same coupling .",
    "the notable exception of the general tendency of @xmath83-type increase in the frequency pulling happens at the socalled multiple thresholds , which are associated with the periodic rabi flopping @xcite . in this case , @xmath84 changes discontinuously , and so do @xmath85 and @xmath67 resulting in the periodic rise and fall of the pulling with @xmath86 .",
    "thus the microlaser operation is segmented into branch solutions associated with multiple thresholds .",
    "the discontinuous change of the system can be explained in terms of the coherent evolution of the atomic state .",
    "as the system approaches the saturation regime out of the linear regime of each branch solution , the precession of the bloch vector representing the internal state of the gain medium reduces the emission probability of photon from each atom while the phase shift per atom grows . at the transition to a higher branch solution ,",
    "the system is brought to a new steady state by making the precession angle of the bloch vector exceed @xmath87 . in the middle of such interaction",
    "the atomic state traces back to its initial state and starts the evolution all over again . in doing so",
    ", the emission probability is boosted up and results in a sudden rise of the mean photon number  also known as a quantum jump @xcite  while the phase shift per atom diminishes .",
    "hence , upon the multiple thresholds , the microlaser behaves in a counter - intuitive manner in the sense that it becomes less refractive with a more dense medium of atoms .",
    "this nontrivial pumping dependence based on the strong atom - cavity coupling is one of the distinctive features of the microlaser .",

    "the pulling - induced broadening exceeds the linewidth of any constituent lorentzian even with a detuning of several times of @xmath34 away from the atomic resonance , thus becomes the dominant source of decoherence for a large part of the tuning range of the microlaser .",
