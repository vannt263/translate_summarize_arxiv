    "the magellan observations falling in the same phase bin ( bin  width 0.03 ) were averaged to increase the signal  to  noise .",
    "the error in the phase is dominated by the integration time used to obtain the spectrum and/or the spread in phase when averaging the magellan data , and not by the propagation of the ephemeris to the date of the observation .",

    "since the spectra are varying strongly as a function of orbital phase , we were not able to cross  correlate the spectra in order to determine the radial velocity .",
    "instead , we fitted gaussians to the line profiles and compared the central wavelength with the rest wavelength of the line .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we detected several lines of the hydrogen balmer series ( among which the double  peaked h@xmath17 emission line ) .",

    "h@xmath21 changed from a double  peaked emission line into a strong absorption line with a single emission line on the red side , and back into a strong double  peaked emission line with a weak absorption to the blue side .",

    "hints of the presence of the same pattern were found for the weaker hydrogen balmer lines below 4000as well , but due to the limited signal  to  noise the presence or absence of such components could not always be determined .",
    "these double  peaked lines are most likely formed in the optically thin outer parts of the accretion disk .",
    "several he  i lines were detected ( e.g. the he  i 5875.966 absorption line also reported by , the he  i 4026.357 absorption line and the he  i 3809.10 and 3888.60 emission lines ) .",
    "the he  i lines did not show evidence for changes in line  profile such as those found for the hydrogen balmer lines , although since the lines are often weak we can not always exclude that the lines are composites of lines originating both in the accretion disk and in the secondary star .",
    "the bowen blend , detected in 2a  1822371 by was not clearly detected because it fell close to the edge of the ccd .",
    " peaked he  ii emission lines with rest wavelength of 4685.71and 5411.53 were also detected .",
    "their strength and profile changed strongly as a function of orbital phase , similar to the double  peaked h@xmath21 and h@xmath16 lines .",
    "a list of lines which were clearly detected is given in table  [ lines ] .",
    "for our radial velocity study we only used the he  i absorption lines at 4026.357 and 5875.966(see figure  [ vrad ] ; _ right panel _ ; dots are measurements using vlt data and crosses are measurements using magellan data .",
    "note that the two sets of measurements are completely consistent without any evidence for a systematic offset . )",
    "we excluded the hydrogen balmer lines since we could not always unambiguously separate the emission component(s ) from the absorption component . when the hydrogen absorption and emission components could unambiguously be separated the velocities determined from the hydrogen absorption lines were consistent with those of the he  i absorption lines .",
    "the he  i lines were always detected at phases 0.3 to 0.95 .",
    "we fitted a sinusoid to the measured radial ",
    "velocity curve using the orthogonal distance regression ( odr ) technique to minimize the @xmath22 ( the reported errors indicate the 1@xmath6 uncertainties throughout this paper ) .    fixing the orbital period and phase to the values",
    "predicted from pulse timing did not result in a good fit ( @xmath23 for 45 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "inspection of the fit reveals that the phase of minimal velocity occurs earlier than expected on the basis of the orbital ephemeris ( see figure  [ vrad ] ; _ right panel _ dotted line ) .",
    "such effects have been noticed before in radial velocity curves of several cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; e.g. ) and are thought to be caused by asymmetric heating of the companion star ; i.e. the centre of light is offset from the centre of mass of the secondary , and not on the binary axis .",
    "since one side of the companion star contributes disproportionally , the rotational broadening of the absorption profile is not uniform ; this leads to a systematic velocity shift ( ) .",
    "we will come back to this in the discussion .",
    "this heating effect can be accommodated by allowing for a phase shift in the sinusoid or by introducing a small apparent eccentricity ( ) .    leaving the phase of the sinusoid as a free parameter improved the fit dramatically ( @xmath24 for 44 degrees of freedom ; see figure  [ vrad ] , _ right panel _",
    ", solid line ; the phase shifts from 0.0 to 0.08@xmath00.01 ) .",
    "this yields a systemic velocity , v@xmath25 , of 67@xmath015 km s@xmath2 and a radial velocity semi ",
    "amplitude , k , of 327@xmath017 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we note that the v@xmath25 and k are correlated in the fit since the absorption line measurements are predominantly located at phases 0.5 to 1 . after we tried to improve the fit by including the second harmonic of the sinusoid to accommodate a small , apparent , eccentricity .",
    "the fit with two sinusoids was not significantly better ( cf .",
    "@xmath26 for 42 degrees of freedom for a two  sinusoids fit vs. @xmath24 for 44 degrees of freedom for a single sinusoid fit ) .",
    "we determined the radial velocity of the companion star of 2a  1822371 using vlt and magellan spectroscopic observations . fitting a sinusoid to radial velocity measurements using two he  i stellar absorption lines a semi  amplitude of 327@xmath017 km s@xmath2 was found , with a best fit systemic velocity of 67@xmath015 km s@xmath2 .",
    "we could combine this with the velocity amplitude of the neutron star ( derived from pulse  timing analysis ; ) to derive a neutron and companion star mass .",
    "however , we found that the epoch of minimum velocity occurs early with respect to the epoch calculated from the ephemeris derived from pulse timing .",
    "together with the fact that the absorption lines were predominantly detected around phase 0.75 this is strong evidence that the companion star suffers from asymmetric heating ( see also ; that 2a  1822371 suffers from x  ray heating was also shown by and ) .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the centre  of  light of the companion star does not coincide with its centre of mass , nor with the binary axis .",
    "the effect this has on the determined radial velocity amplitude depends on what part of the companion star is observed and whether as assumed here and below the companion star is in co  rotation . in several cvs absorption lines from the non  irradiated side of the companion star , the side pointing towards the observer at phase 0 ( for an inclination , @xmath14 , of 90@xmath27 ) are observed ( ) . in that case the measured radial velocity amplitude is an upper limit to the true amplitude .",
    "if we were to observe the irradiated side in such a case the determined radial velocity amplitude would be a lower limit .",
    "furthermore , the minimum and maximum of the radial velocity curve would both move closer to phase 0.5 whereas the velocities at phase 0 and 0.5 should be the same ( and they should be zero ) .",
    "however , from figure  [ vrad ] ( _ right panel _ ) it is clear that in case of 2a  1822371 these velocities are unequal and thus this model is not applicable here .",
    "the distribution of points in figure  [ vrad ] ( _ right panel _ ) indicates that the leading side of the companion star was observed predominantly , i.e. , the side pointing towards the observer at phase 0.75 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "if we assume a uniform contribution from this leading hemisphere to the line profiles , then , due to the rotation of the companion star , the velocities at phase 0 and 0.5 will be red and blue shifted , respectively , but the magnitude of the shift will be the same .",
    "the velocity measured at phase 0.25 and 0.75 with respect to the average of the velocities at phase 0 and 0.5 ( which is the systemic velocity ) represents the true radial velocity amplitude in such a model . since only part of the sinusoid is observed in case of 2a  1822371 the radial velocity semi ",
    "amplitude is calculated from the difference between the average of the velocities at phases 0 and 0.5 , and the velocity at 0.75 only . using this model",
    "we derive a systemic velocity of 54@xmath024 km s@xmath2 and a radial velocity semi  amplitude of 280@xmath026 km s@xmath2 . combining this with the velocity amplitude of the neutron star a neutron star mass of 0.97@xmath00.24m@xmath5is found ( 1@xmath6",
    "; the uncertainty in the system inclination , @xmath29 , was included ; for the determination of the inclination see references given in the introduction ) .",
    "the companion star mass is 0.33@xmath00.05m@xmath5 for @xmath29 .",
    "if instead the orientation of the hemisphere we observe is , as the data suggest , somewhat more towards the side facing the x  ray source , then these quoted values of k and the masses are likely to be underestimates .",
    "clearly , phase  resolved observations detecting lines from the cold hemisphere of the companion star are needed in order to investigate the systematic effects further .",
    "we note however that radial velocity measurements using lines from the non  irradiated side only would lead to an upper limit on the mass of the neutron star .",
    "determined that the masses of neutron stars in radio pulsar binaries are consistent with a gaussian distribution around m@xmath30m@xmath5 .",
    "the lower limit to the mass of the neutron star in 2a  1822371 is consistent with this within 2 @xmath6",
    ".    observed several he  i absorption lines among which the two we observed in 2a  1822371 in the spectrum of the source ac  211 in m  15 ( the source is thought to be in the class of accretion disk corona , adc , sources of which 2a  1822371 is the prototype ; ) .",
    "they argue that the he  i absorption in ac  211 is due to disk edge material , which when illuminated by the hot inner part of the accretion disk gives rise to the he  i absorption lines .",
    "unexplained in such a scenario is the fact that even at orbital phases where the inner part of the accretion disk is not observed through localized disk edge material ( e.g. at phases 0.20.7 ) still absorption lines are observed .",
    "furthermore , they argue that the radial velocity measurements using these lines in ac  211 reflect the orbital motion of the compact object . in case of 2a  1822371 we know from the pulse timing measurements of the orbit of the neutron star that this is not the case .    as for several cvs ( most notably u  gem ; ) , the observed , irradiated , side of the companion star seems not centred towards the neutron star or white dwarf in the case of cvs .",
    "the reason for this is unclear .",
    "it has been speculated that the hot spot plays an important role in heating the companion star in cvs ( ) .",
    "however , as for cvs ( ) this seems unlikely in case of 2a  1822371 since the centre of the accretion disk and the neutron star in lmxbs such as 2a  1822371 should be much brighter than the hot spot .",
    "even though shielding of the companion star by the accretion disk could be important the large adc should circumvent shielding at least partially .",
    "modelling irradiation  induced motions in the secondary stars in cvs showed that the heated material is deflected towards the leading hemisphere as a result of the coriolis force ; this is in accordance with our findings ( see for a review ) .    comparing our data with previous spectroscopic observations (; ; ; ) we note that measured the he  i 5875.966line to be present over the whole orbit .",
    "furthermore , a separate absorption component arose near phase 0.00.2 . in our higher resolution",
    "uves data we did not find evidence for this extra component , nor were we able to measure the he  i line at all phases . already pointed out that the spectra showed evidence for long term variability . with our new high  resolution uves",
    "spectra we can settle the issue of the presence of emission or absorption lines in the blue part of the spectrum ( see discussion in ) ; we now know that at certain phases both ( he  i ) emission and hydrogen balmer absorption lines are present .    as was noted before , for a neutron star mass of @xmath11.4m@xmath5 the companion star is undermassive , i.e. less massive than a main  sequence companion star filling its roche  lobe in a 5.57 hour orbit ( main  sequence mass @xmath10.62m@xmath5 ; e.g. ; ; ) .",
    "thus the density of the star , like that of evolved stars , is lower than the density of a main  sequence star .",
    "the companion stars in some cvs were also shown to be undermassive .",
    "it is believed that the companion star in those cvs is out of thermal equilibrium ( see ) . however",
    ", if the companion star in 2a  1822371 is evolved this would mean that it was considerably more massive than 0.4m@xmath5 at the onset of mass transfer since such a star would not have evolved in a hubble time .",
    "alternatively , a scenario in which the companion star was brought into contact with its roche lobe by transfer of angular momentum due to gravitational radiation can be envisaged",
    ". however , such losses are not sufficient to sustain the mass transfer rate of @xmath31 m@xmath32 which is needed to explain the intrinsic x  ray luminosity ( l@xmath33 ; ) .",
    "since x  ray irradiation of the companion star was shown to heat the star , irradiation induced mass  transfer ( ) could in principle also help to keep mass  transfer going .",
    "however , due to the presence and size of a bulge on the accretion disk edge a large fraction of the companion star will be shielded and the irradiating flux will be reduced , making it unlikely that a mass transfer rate of @xmath31 m@xmath34 is induced by x  ray irradiation .",
    "in addition to gravitational radiation and x  ray irradiation angular momentum transferred by magnetic braking ( ) could explain the mass  loss rate ( although it was found that at present the orbit is expanding ; ) .",
    "we conclude therefore that the companion star in 2a  1822371 is either out of thermal equilibrium ( possibly due to the high mass loss rate and effects of x  ray heating ) , or evolved and has lost more than @xmath10.4m@xmath5 ( this would make the companion star @xmath10.8m@xmath5 at the start of mass transfer ; such a star could just have evolved in a hubble time ) , or an interplay between angular momentum losses caused by magnetic braking and gravitational radiation supplemented by mass  loss driven by x  ray irradiation is driving the evolution of this lmxb .",
