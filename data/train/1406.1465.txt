    "the first generation of stars so - called population iii stars ushered the universe out of the cosmic dark ages and brought the first light in the cosmos .",
    "they are presumed to be assembled in dark matter halos of @xmath8 at @xmath9 @xcite and influenced the subsequent structure formation via mechanical , chemical and radiative feedback .",
    "pop iii stars enriched the intergalactic medium with metals and led to the second generation of stars known as pop ii stars . according to the hierarchical paradigm of structure formation",
    ", the first galaxies are formed in massive primordial halos of @xmath10 at about @xmath11 most likely hosting both stellar populations .    during the epoch of reionization ,",
    "radiation emitted by the pop ii stars not only photo - ionized the gas but also photo - dissociated @xmath12 and hd molecules .",
    "the molecular hydrogen is the only coolant in primordial gas which can bring the gas temperature down to few hundred k and may induce star formation . in the presence of an intense uv flux ,",
    "the formation of @xmath13 remains suppressed ( due to photo - detachment of @xmath0 which is the main pathway of @xmath13 formation ) in pristine halos . under these conditions , cooling only proceeds via lyman alpha radiation in massive primordial halos of @xmath10 and massive objects are expected to form and are known as direct collapse black holes ( dcbhs ) .",
    "the formation of dcbhs requires a critical strength of uv flux above which halos remain @xmath13 free @xcite .",
    "such a uv flux can only exist in the close vicinity of star forming galaxies @xcite and the mass scales of the resulting stars have been explored in recent studies . in fact , high resolution numerical simulations show that supermassive stars of @xmath14 form in the presence of strong uv flux @xcite and agree with theoretical predictions . employing a cosmological framework following the formation and accretion of the resulting supermassive objects , ferrara et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have derived detailed predictions on the mass function of the first high - mass black holes .    on the other hand , moderate strengths of the background uv flux",
    "may occur more often during the epoch of reionization without requiring the presence of nearby sources . in the ubiquity of such moderate uv fluxes ,",
    "the formation of @xmath13 does occur and may lead to star formation .",
    "particularly , during the epoch of reionization the dominant background flux is emitted by pop ii stars . the strength of such uv flux to dissociate @xmath13 formation was quantified in a recent study by @xcite and found that @xmath15 ranges from 400 - 700 higher than previous estimates .",
    "therefore , halos exposed below @xmath15 are expected to be more abundant , for @xmath16 the fraction of halos is seven orders of magnitude higher compared to the @xmath17 ( see figure c1 of * ? ? ?",

    "in total , we have performed six cosmological simulations for two different halos of a few times @xmath21 and varied the strength of @xmath3 ( i.e. 10 , 100 and 500 ) .",
    "our results show that initially the gas is heated up to @xmath41 k in the presence of the background uv flux and then cools by lyman alpha cooling . depending on the strength of the uv flux",
    ", @xmath13 formation takes place and cooling due to the molecular hydrogen becomes effective . for @xmath42 10 , 100 ,",
    "the central temperature in the halo is about 1000 k while for @xmath43 the temperature in the core is a few thousand k as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is also found that for a weaker flux ( i.e. @xmath42 10 ) , @xmath13 cooling kicks in at densities around @xmath44 while for @xmath42 100 it becomes effective around @xmath45 .",
    "for the strongest flux , it starts at even higher densities of about @xmath46 .",
    "the density structure for various strengths of the uv field is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath42 10 the gas in the halos becomes more clumpy and indicates the possibility to form multiple clumps .",
    "these clumps are formed by locally induced @xmath13 cooling which lowers the gas temperature down to a few hundred k as shown in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] . for @xmath42 10 ,",
    "the clumps with no sinks are gravitational unbound and have masses of the order of few solar masses . for @xmath42 100 ,",
    "the halos have less structure and the number of cold clumps is reduced .",
    "this is due to the fact that the overall temperature in the halo is higher particularly in the outskirts which suppresses fragmentation .",
    "similarly , the fraction of molecular hydrogen is significantly reduced in the surrounding of the halo . for the strongest flux ( @xmath42 500 )",
    ", there is no sign of fragmentation as the central temperature in the halos is a few thousand k and in one halo later approaches an isothermal state due to the temperature dependence of the @xmath13 collisional dissociation rate @xcite .",
    "the fraction of molecular hydrogen is significantly lower and is limited to only core of the halos .    to further quantify the masses of the clumps formed in our simulated halos , we employed sink particles which represent the protostars in our simulations and followed the evolution for many free - fall times .",
    "the masses of the sinks are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "it is found that for @xmath42 10 , the masses of the sinks are a few hundred to about 1500 m@xmath7 . in halo a two sinks are formed . for @xmath42 100 ,",
    "only one massive sink is formed in each halo and their masses are 7400 and 2500 m@xmath7 .",
    "the masses of the sinks are above 22 , 000 solar masses for the strongest flux case and a single sink is formed per halo .",
    "overall , our results suggest that fragmentation in the halos is reduced by increasing the strength of background uv flux according to the theoretical expectations . for @xmath42 10 and 100 , although the central temperatures are quite similar the masses are higher by a factor of a few for @xmath42 100 .",
    "this is because of the warmer gas in the surroundings of the halo which leads to higher accretion rates and consequently higher sink masses at the end of our simulations .",
    "it is found that the masses of the sinks in halo b are about a factor of two lower compared to halo a. overall , the average density in halo b is lower and has a higher rotational support .",
    "this leads to lower accretion rates in halo b and consequently lower sink masses .",
    "the physical properties of the halos are depicted in figures [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "the maximum density in the halos is @xmath47 .",
    "the density profile follow an r@xmath48 behavior at larger radii for almost all fluxes and becomes flat in the core of the halo corresponding to the jeans length .",
    "the deviations from this behavior are observed for weaker values of @xmath3 due to the additional substructure inside the halo .",
    "the difference between weaker and strongest flux are more prominent in halo b as it collapses almost isothermally for @xmath43 .",
    "the overall density in halo b is lower by a factor of a few compared to the halo a around 10 pc . for @xmath49 , cooling due",
    "to @xmath13 becomes effective in the central 10 pc of the halo . on the other hand for @xmath18",
    "it is limited to the central pc of the halo while for @xmath43 cooling due to the molecular hydrogen is not very effective due to its lower abundance .",
    "the impact of different thermal evolutions is also reflected in the infall velocities of the halos .",
    "higher temperatures lead to higher infall velocities and also indicate lower molecular hydrogen fractions in those halos .",
    "similarly lower infall velocities are observed for the weaker fluxes indicating that the halo is in the molecular cooling phase .",
    "halo b has lower radial infall velocities compared to halo a. large accretion rates of about 0.1  m@xmath7/yr are observed .",
    "the decline in accretion rates towards the center is due to the increasing pressure support within the jeans length .",
    "it is further found that the accretion rates are slightly higher for stronger fluxes and are lower in halo b compared to halo a. the enclosed mass in the halos is higher for stronger fluxes .",
    "this is due to the higher infall velocities and higher accretion rates for these cases .",
    "it is also found that halo b has higher rotational support .",
    "we further noted that the accretions rates increased during the course of simulations and are shown for a representative case in figure [ fig7 ] .    we show the expected stellar masses for various values of @xmath3 in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "it is observed that the stars formed in the presence of uv feedback are very massive typically above one thousand solar masses .",
    "this figure shows an increase in the stellar masses with the strength of the uv flux , i.e. the higher the uv flux the more massive the star .",
    "fragmentation may occur at larger scales but may not be able to prevent the formation of massive stars .",
    "we expect that these massive to supermassive stars are the potential candidates for the formation of intermediate to supermassive black holes .",
    "in this article , we explored fragmentation in massive primordial halos of a few times @xmath1 m@xmath7 irradiated by different uv fluxes below the lyman limit . to achieve this goal , we performed high resolution cosmological simulations for two distinct halos collapsing at @xmath5 and varied the strength of the uv flux from 10 - 500 in units of @xmath3 .",
    "we exploited the adaptive mesh refinement technique to follow the collapse of the halo by employing additional 18 dynamical refinement levels during the course of simulations which yields an effective resolution of about 100 au . to further follow the evolution for longer time scales , sink particles representing protostars",
    "were employed .",
    "a fixed jeans resolution of 32 cells were mandated during the entire course of simulations .",
    "our findings show that the formation of @xmath13 gets delayed and no strong fragmentation occurs in the halos illuminated by the uv flux of 10 - 500 in units of @xmath3 . for @xmath49 , in our simulated halos",
    "binary or multiple systems may likely form but for higher values of @xmath3 only one single object is formed . at the end of our simulations , massive protostars of a few 100 - 10 , 000 solar masses are formed and large accretion rates of about @xmath50  m@xmath7/yr are observed .",
    "these relatively high accretion rates distinguish them from normal star formation mode in minihalos .",
    "these massive stars formed in the early universe are the potential candidates for the formation of intermediate mass black holes .",
    "@xmath13 cooling reaches local thermal equilibrium at densities higher than @xmath51 and the cooling rate scales as density while compressional heating varies with @xmath52 .",
    "so the expected polytropic index stiffens ( i.e. @xmath53 @xmath541 ) and suppresses fragmentation @xcite .",
    "of course , the possibility of fragmentation at higher density can not be completely ruled out and low mass stars may form in addition to the most massive object .",
    "@xcite performed similar simulations for a halo of similar mass irradiated by the background uv flux emitted by population iii stars .",
    "they also found that the gas self - shields from the uv flux and a dense core of @xmath55  m@xmath7 develops .",
    "they further used sink particles to follow the simulations for longer times and found that a massive sink of about 1000 solar masses is formed .",
    "their study is comparable to @xmath49 in our simulations due to the background uv flux emitted by two different stellar populations .",
    "they have employed radiation spectrum with @xmath56  k in their calculations which mainly dissociates the molecular hydrogen via the solomon process and @xmath13 self - shielding is more important in contrast to our study .",
    "in particular , we compare the accretion rates at the same times in both simulations and our results appear rather consistent .",
    "we note however that there is no one - to - one correspondence , as the thermal evolution does not precisely match and our halo is somewhat warmer on larger scales .",
    "in addition , there are of course fluctuations from halo to halo , so some variation between the halos is expected , as we also see here when comparing halos a and b.    to further explore the possible fragmentation at higher densities , we in total added 27 refinement levels which yield resolution down to sub au scales ( 0.25  au ) and the peak densities of @xmath57 .",
    "we however do not see any indication of further fragmentation for these runs .",
    "such verification further confirms that even if fragmentation occurs at later stages the mass of central object would not change significantly .",
    "our results for @xmath49 are in agreement with @xcite who simulated about 100 minihalos and found that even massive stars of thousand solar masses can form in the presence of similar mass accretion rates that found in this study .",
    "we also note that our simulations do not include the ionizing uv feedback by the protostar .",
    "as long as the accretion rates remain higher than @xmath58  m@xmath7/yr , no strong feedback is expected .",
    "ionizing feedback may kick in once the accretion rates drop more significantly , potentially limiting the growth of the resulting objects .",
    "we also assumed that halos are metal free and given the patchy distribution of the metal such halos may exist down to z=6 @xcite .",
    "however , if metal enrichment takes places in these halos it will lead to fragmentation and most likely star cluster of low mass stars @xcite .",
    "even a small amount of dust , i.e. @xmath59 is sufficient to boost the h@xmath60 fraction and induce fragmentation .",
    "in fact , recent observations suggest the potential presence of intermediate mass black holes in globular clusters @xcite .    from the results given here , we deduce that massive to supermassive stars may be more common than previously expected , and can also form for radiative backgrounds @xmath61 . based on the recent estimates of @xcite for the expected density of halos for various uv field strengths ,",
    "the expected fraction of halos exposed to @xmath61 is few orders of magnitude higher .",
    "we expect such stars to produce a considerable amount of uv feedback once they are on the main sequence , thus considerably contributing to the ionization of their environment , and perhaps also to the epoch of reionization . at the end of their lives",
    ", they may collapse to an intermediate mass black hole , and the x - rays released during their formation may contribute to establish a global background @xcite .",
