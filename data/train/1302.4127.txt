    "beamforming is an important antenna array technique with application in wireless communications to adjust array parameters for maintaining the array response from a certain direction while attenuating interference and noise .",
    "the optimal linearly constrained minimum variance ( lcmv ) beamformer @xcite is a well - known beamforming technique .",
    "many adaptive filtering algorithms have been proposed for the implementation of the lcmv beamformer , ranging from the low - complexity stochastic gradient ( sg ) algorithm to the more complex recursive least squares ( rls ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the major drawback of the reported algorithms is that they require a large number of samples to reach the steady - state when the number of elements in the filter is large . besides",
    ", filters with many elements always show a poor performance under dynamic scenarios for tracking signals embedded in interference and noise .",
    "an effective approach to circumvent these shortcomings is to utilize reduced - rank array processing and adaptive filtering techniques for the beamformer design .",
    "the reduced - rank array processing techniques aim to construct a projection matrix to project the array input vector onto a lower dimensional subspace , and use a reduced - rank adaptive filter to perform the weight update within this subspace . compared with the full - rank techniques , the reduced - rank one achieves fast convergence and improved tracking performance since the number of elements in the reduced - rank filter is much less than those in the full - rank filters , especially under the condition where the number of sensor elements in the array is large .",
    "the popular reduced - rank schemes include the auxiliary vector filtering ( avf ) @xcite , the multistage wiener filter ( mswf ) @xcite , and the joint iterative optimization ( jio ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the sg and rls type algorithms are developed based on the reduced - rank schemes for implementation . despite the improved convergence and tracking performance achieved with these reduced - rank adaptive algorithms , the calculation of the projection matrix and the reduced - rank weight vector requires a significant computational cost .",
    "the contribution of this paper is the development of a new adaptive filtering algorithm for the beamformer design that guarantees the improved convergence and tracking performance compared with those of the existing full - rank and reduced - rank algorithms , whereas the computational cost is much lower than that of its reduced - rank counterparts .",
    "an efficient approach to reduce the computational cost is to employ a set - membership ( sm ) technique to adaptive filtering @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the sm technique specifies a bound on the magnitude of the estimation error ( or the array output ) and uses the data - selective updates to encompass a set of parameters in a feasibility set , in which any member is a valid sm filter that satisfies the constraints of the design criterion .",
    "it involves two steps : @xmath1 ) information evaluation and @xmath2 ) parameter adaptation . if the parameter update does not occur frequently , and the information evaluation does not involve much complexity , the overall computational cost can be saved substantially .",
    "the well - known sm based algorithms include the works reported in @xcite-@xcite , which were developed for the full - rank parameter estimation . in this paper , we introduce the sm technique into reduced - rank array processing and propose a novel reduced - rank adaptive algorithm .",
    "the proposed algorithm introduces a framework to combine the sm mechanism with the reduced - rank joint iterative optimization ( jio ) scheme @xcite , and develops a rls algorithm for implementation , which is termed jio - sm - rls .",
    "an effective time varying bound is employed in the proposed algorithm as a constraint to avoid the risk of overbounding or underbounding @xcite .",
    "compared with the existing algorithms , the jio - sm - rls algorithm inherits the positive features of the jio scheme to enhance the convergence and tracking performance , and utilizes the data - selective updates of the sm mechanism to save the computational cost significantly .    the remaining of this paper is organized as follows : we outline a system model for beamforming and present the reduced - rank technique in section ii .",
    "section iii introduces the reduced - rank sm scheme and section iv derives the proposed jio - sm - rls algorithm .",
    "simulation results are provided and discussed in section v , and conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath3 narrowband signals impinge on a uniform linear array ( ula ) of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) sensor elements .",
    "the sources are assumed to be in the far field with directions of arrival ( doas ) @xmath6,  ,@xmath7 .",
    "the received vector @xmath8 at the @xmath9th snapshot can be modeled as    @xmath10      @xmath21    where @xmath22^{t}\\in\\mathcal{c}^{m\\times 1}$ ] is the complex weight vector of the adaptive filter , and @xmath23 stands for the hermitian transpose .      for large @xmath4 or in the dynamic scenario ,",
    "the full - rank adaptive algorithms ( e.g. , sg or rls ) fail or provide poor performance with a small number of snapshots for the beamformer design .",
    "many of recent works in the literature have been reported based on the reduced - rank techniques to solve these problems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the important feature of the reduced - rank schemes is to construct a projection matrix @xmath24\\in\\mathcal c^{m\\times r}$ ] with columns @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) constitute a bank of @xmath27 full - rank filters as given by @xmath28^t\\in\\mathcal c^{m\\times1}$ ] .",
    "the projection matrix performs the dimensionality reduction to project the full - rank received - vector onto a lower dimension and retains the key information of the original signal in a reduced - rank received vector , which is    @xmath29    where @xmath30 denotes the reduced - rank received vector and @xmath27 ( @xmath31 ) is the rank number . in what follows ,",
    "all @xmath27-dimensional quantities are denoted by an over bar .",
    "the reduced - rank adaptive filter @xmath32 $ ] follows the projection matrix to produce the filter output    @xmath33    the popular reduced - rank schemes include the avf @xcite , the mswf @xcite , and the jio @xcite , which employ the sg or the rls type algorithms to calculate @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the beamformer design .",
    "however , with respect to the sg type algorithms , it is difficult to predetermine the step size values to make a tradeoff between fast convergence and misadjustment in dynamic scenarios .",
    "furthermore , the computational cost is high due to the calculation of the projection matrix .",
    "in this section , we introduce a novel reduced - rank sm scheme by combining the sm mechanism with the reduced - rank jio scheme . it should be remarked that the jio scheme is considered here since it exhibits the superior convergence and tracking performance with relatively simple realization over other reduced - rank schemes @xcite .",
    "the existing sm techniques focus on full - rank signal processing , namely , the related filter @xmath36 is encompassed in a feasibility set , in which any member satisfies a predetermined or time - varying bound on the magnitude of the estimation error ( or the array output ) .",
    "the sm algorithms utilize the data - selective updates to reduce computational complexity @xcite .",
    "regarding the proposed reduced - rank sm scheme , some valid pairs of @xmath37 are consistent with the bound at each time instant due to the joint iterative exchange of information .",
    "the solution to the proposed scheme is a feasibility set in the parameter space , which is    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the transmitted data of the desired user from @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the set of all possible data pairs @xmath42 .",
    "the pairs of @xmath43 in the set are upper bounded in magnitude by a time - varying bound @xmath44 that can be viewed as a constrained condition in the beamformer design .",
    "actually , @xmath41 can not be traversed all over in practice .",
    "an alternative way is to construct an exact membership set @xmath45 , which is the intersection of the constraint sets provided by the observations over the time instants @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 with the constraint set @xmath48 is a subset of the exact membership set @xmath45 .",
    "the two sets will be equal if the data pairs traverse @xmath41 completely .",
    "in this section , we employ the proposed reduced - rank sm scheme to develop a new rls algorithm .",
    "the objective is to design a bank of full - rank filters and a reduced - rank filter whose output is not greater than a time - varying bound but remains the signal from one certain direction for all input data .",
    "it can be derived by minimizing the following cost function    @xmath49\\\\ & \\textrm{subject~to}~~\\bar{\\boldsymbol w}^h\\bar{\\boldsymbol a}(\\theta_0)=\\gamma,~~\\textrm{and}~~|\\bar{\\boldsymbol w}^h\\boldsymbol t_r^h{\\boldsymbol x}(i)|^2=g^2(i ) , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the full - rank and the reduced - rank steering vectors of the desired signal , @xmath52 is a constant with respect to the constraint , @xmath53 is the reduced - rank received vector , and @xmath54 corresponds to a bound within the constraint set @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the solutions @xmath43 construct the feasibility set in ( [ 5 ] ) and satisfy the constraints in ( [ 6 ] ) .    the constrained cost function can be transferred into an unconstrained least squares ( ls ) cost function by using the method of lagrange multipliers @xcite , which is    @xmath57+\\lambda_2\\big[\\bar{\\boldsymbol w}^h(i)\\bar{\\boldsymbol a}(\\theta_0)-\\gamma\\big ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath58 plays the role of the forgetting factor and lagrange multiplier with respect to the constraint on the amplitude of the array output , and @xmath59 denotes another lagrange multiplier for the constraint on the steering vector .",
