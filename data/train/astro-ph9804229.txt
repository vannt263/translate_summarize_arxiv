    "cal 87 has long been known as one of only a small number of luminous x - ray binaries in the large magellanic cloud ( long , helfand , & grabelsky 1981 , pakull et al .",
    "1988 ) . its optical spectrum , with he ii and h emission lines on a very blue continuum , shows it to be similar to galactic low - mass x - ray binaries",
    ". however , its x - ray spectrum reveals cal 87 to be one of the rare , very luminous ( l@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) supersoft sources ( sss ) which have little or no radiation above @xmath10.5 kev ( e.g. trmper et al .",
    "1991 , greiner 1996 ) . the sss are widely thought to be binaries in which a white dwarf is undergoing rapid accretion from a more massive companion , leading to steady nuclear burning on the surface of the white dwarf ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "cal 87 is unique among supersoft sources in having both optical and x - ray eclipses ( callanan et al .",
    "1989 , cowley et al .  1990 :",
    "csch ) which provide extra information about the disk structure and in principle help to constrain the stellar masses . in the original spectroscopic data of csch , he ii 4686  emission was shown to move with k@xmath640 km s@xmath5 and proper phasing with respect to the eclipse so that it was interpreted as due to orbital motion of the compact star .",
    "csch concluded that the compact star had a mass @xmath76m@xmath2 , and hence these data implied the presence of a black hole .",
    "however , optical spectra taken a few years later , combined with velocities from lines in the far uv ( hutchings et al .",
    "1995 ) , showed a quite different behavior .",
    "the velocity amplitude was larger and the phasing was very different , indicating that at times the velocities are not entirely due to orbital motion and the line - formation regions change .",
    "one problem is that spectroscopic determination of the masses is not entirely straightforward since the nearly edge - on view of the system ( @xmath8 ) causes complications in the line profiles due to motions in the accretion disk .    in this paper",
    "we report on a series of spectroscopic data with improved signal - to - noise ( s / n ) and new , concurrent photometry which we obtained at ctio in 1996 in order to conduct a more thorough investigation of cal 87 .",
    "cal 87 was observed extensively during a five - night run in 1996 november with the ctio 4-m telescope using the kpgl1 grating and loral 3k detector .",
    "the wavelength range covered was @xmath137006700 , with resolution @xmath13 .",
    "exposure times were 20 minutes , and the mean s / n was about 20 per resolution element .",
    "the one - dimensional wavelength - calibrated spectra were extracted and processed following standard iraf procedures .",
    "twenty - five spectra were obtained , evenly distributed through the orbital phases , with significantly better s / n and wavelength coverage than those used in the csch paper .",
    "table 1 gives the journal of observations .",
    "figure  [ med ] shows the spectrum of cal 87 in and out of eclipse , with principal features identified .",
    "the spectrum is similar to other supersoft x - ray binaries , with the strongest features being emission lines of he ii and hydrogen .",
    "however , the overall emission - line equivalent widths are below typical values ( see cowley et al .  (",
    "1998 ) for comparison with other supersoft systems ) .",
    "the he ii pickering - series emissions are sufficiently strong that they must significantly contaminate the h balmer emission lines .",
    "thus , throughout this paper  h@xmath9 \" ,  h@xmath10 \" , etc .",
    "refer to the blend of hydrogen and he ii pickering lines . also present",
    "are emission lines of the high excitation ions o vi ( 3811 , 3834 , 5290 , also seen in all other supersoft binaries ) , n v ( 4603 , 4619 ) , and the c iii / n iii blend ( @xmath14630 - 50 ) .",
    "there is a broad emission at 4417that we have been unable to identify .",
    "it is similar in strength to he ii 4541 .",
    "the spectra also show balmer absorption lines within the broad emission profiles , not seen in previous spectra of cal 87 .",
    "the difference between the out - of - eclipse and in - eclipse spectra is also shown at the bottom of figure  [ med ] .",
    "one sees that the bluest part of the continuum and some emission lines are eclipsed during each orbit .",
    "however , in the photometry section below we will show that the apparent reddening of the continuum in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands during eclipse , reported by alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , is due to an unresolved red field star which contributes about half of the light during eclipse .",
    "all of the individual spectra were examined as a function of time to see if the observed changes are related to the well - known orbital period ( p=0.44 days ) or to some other time scale .",
    "it is clear that the spectral changes are strongly phase - correlated , and we see no recognizable changes on non - orbital timescales during the 5-night run . on each individual spectrum measurements",
    "were made of the radial velocity of he ii 4686and the line strengths of several lines . in order to measure the weakest features ,",
    "the spectra were co - added in the observed wavelength frame in eight phase bins , each with a spread of no more than 0.1p in phase .",
    "the phase 0 ( eclipse ) and phase 0.80.9 bins each contain four individual spectra .",
    "the phase 0.1 bin contains two spectra , and the remaining five bins each contain three spectra .",
    "figure  [ binned ] displays the phase - binned spectra from @xmath141004900  as well as the sum of the spectra from phases 0.20.8 .",
    "figure  [ bin2 ] shows more detail from the phase - binned spectra in region from @xmath146004900 .",
    "using these spectra , radial velocities of he ii 4686  and several other weaker lines were measured independently by more than one author using different techniques such as parabola - fitting , line centroiding , and cross - correlating .",
    "the agreement between sets of measures was well within the estimated errors of @xmath13 km s@xmath5 in velocity and 10% in equivalent width .",
    "the mean values of all measures are listed in table 1 .    however , there are complications in making the line measurements .",
    "some emission lines are asymmetrical and are divided by absorption components that move back and forth across them with phase ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the absorptions are most clearly seen at the h - balmer lines but also may be present in he ii 4686 .",
    "it is not clear whether the he ii pickering lines are affected by absorption , but o vi , c iii , and n v are probably not .",
    "in addition , the emission - line regions undergo different levels of eclipse , and this affects their profiles and hence radial velocites during the eclipse phases . in our measures we attempted to separate the absorption and emission components where possible .",
    "emission - line velocities were based on the broad - line wings , and emission line strengths do not include the absorption components . however , where the absorption and emission velocities are close , such separation is impossible empirically . since the absorption strength changes with phase , modeling by subtraction of a constant absorption profile is not feasible .",
    "we further discuss the consequences of these blends in a later section .",
    "figures  [ lines ] and [ vels ] show the phase variations of the equivalent widths and radial velocities of selected lines , respectively .      to confirm the photometric ephemeris and",
    "look for possible changes in the light curve , @xmath11-band ccd photometry of cal 87 was obtained using the ctio 0.9-m telescope in 1994 november and 1996 november .",
    "the images were calibrated with observations of landolt s ( 1992 ) standard stars and reduced with daophot ( stetson 1987 ) , in a way similar to our earlier work .",
    "differential magnitudes were calculated for the @xmath11 filter relative to local photometric standards within the ccd frames using a procedure which minimizes errors by psf fitting ( schmidtke 1988 ) . a line - of - sight field star ( separation @xmath14 , position angle @xmath15 ; cowley et al .",
    "1991 , deutsch et al .",
    "1996 ) was resolved on most images .",
    "when daophot could not separate the two stars , then the contribution of the field star was subtracted from the blended light .",
    "the 1994 and 1996 photometry for cal 87 is presented in table 2 .",
    "photometric phases have been calculated using the ephemeris of schmidtke et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , which accurately fits the new photometry and all other data we have obtained over the past eleven years .",
    "the ephemeris is :    t@xmath16 hjd 2447506.8021(@xmath17 ) @xmath18 n@xmath190.4426777(@xmath20 ) days    we note that the recent study of cal 87 based on macho data obtained between 1992 and 1996 finds virtually the same period and phasing which differs from ours by only @xmath180.008p ( alcock et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "figure  [ phot ] shows our @xmath21 photometry from all years of observation . a mean light curve , based on observations from 1985 november through 1992 december ( but with most of the data from 19881989 ) , is superposed .",
    "also shown is a plot of residuals of the individual data points from this mean curve .",
    "there is a marked change in the depth of the primary minimum , particularly in the 1994 and 1996 observations which show a decrease of @xmath10.6 mag in @xmath11 ( i.e. the eclipse became shallower ) .",
    "the depth of secondary eclipse also varies , but to a lesser degree .",
    "the eclipse was deepest in 1988 and shallower at all other epochs for which we have observations covering these orbital phases .",
    "the out - of - eclipse light curve does not show a corresponding brightening .",
    "the same amount of extra light which is present at primary mid - eclipse in 1996 would raise the out - of - eclipse brightness by @xmath10.15 mag , but our photometry shows no change in the brightness outside of eclipse . in the bottom panel of figure  [ phot ] the dashed line shows the effect of adding this extra source of light at phases . while this added light fits the 1994 and 1996 ctio data quite well through eclipse , it is clear that this amount of extra light is not present at other phases , as the majority of points lie below the dashed curve .",
    "cal 87 lies within one of the lmc fields monitored by the macho program . to further investigate the change in the depth of eclipses , we obtained public archival macho @xmath11 and @xmath12 data for cal 87 .",
    "these data have been discussed by alcock et al .",
    "( 1997 ) but with somewhat different objectives . @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 magnitudes had already been calculated from the broad - band red and blue colors in which the observations were made .",
    "we do not know exactly how the transformations were carried out , but we can compare the ctio and macho @xmath11 light curves since we have @xmath21 data covering similar dates .",
    "we find that @xmath22 is @xmath10.15 mag brighter than our @xmath21 data in the light curve , and we suggest that the problem may lie in the transformation of the broad - band blue color to @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have sufficient @xmath23 data to compare the red light curves .",
    "thus , for this part of the analysis we have modified our @xmath21 magnitudes by @xmath24 mag in order to intercompare directly the two data sets and study the changing eclipse depth .    adding all of the ( @xmath0)@xmath25 data together ,",
    "one derives a mean color of ( @xmath0)@xmath26 .",
    "however , deutsch et al .  found the out - of - eclipse color of cal 87 to be somewhat redder , with ( @xmath0)@xmath27 .",
    "if , as suggested above , @xmath22 is systematically @xmath10.15 mag too bright , then this would explain the bluer mean color found in the macho data .",
    "this also implies that @xmath28 is approximately similar to our @xmath23 values ( cowley et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "figure  [ minjd ] shows a plot of all macho data obtained within @xmath29p of central eclipse for both @xmath11 and @xmath12 light .",
    "the modified @xmath21 minima ( @xmath30 ) observed between jd 2448900 and jd 2450300 are shown as crosses in figure 7 .",
    "the plot shows that the depth of minimum light has changed by almost a full magnitude during the @xmath14 years of observation .",
    "the depth of primary eclipse was greatest in 1988 and least in 1995 .",
    "both @xmath11 and @xmath12 data , but especially @xmath12 , suggest that there may be a cycle of @xmath1600700 days , although analysis shows this variation is probably not strictly periodic , but rather only a characteristic timescale for the changes .",
    "similar plots have been made of the out - of - eclipse light , using data from restricted ranges of orbital phase .",
    "these show that the average light level remains unchanged through the remainder of the orbit , consistent with the analysis of  extra light \" discussed above and shown in figure 6 .",
    "one clue to understanding the change in the eclipse depth could lie in any observed color changes .",
    "alcock et al .  (",
    "1997 ) plot a ( @xmath0)-color curve which appears to show that cal 87 reddens during eclipse , but since they failed to correct their magnitudes for the effects of the red field star ( discussed above ) which contributes nearly half the light of the system at primary eclipse , their color curve is not correct . using the magnitudes of deutsch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) which were derived from well - resolved hst images , we have corrected the @xmath22 and @xmath28 magnitudes for the presence of this nearby , unresolved star .",
    "( deutsch et al .  found yet another line - of - sight optical companion with a separation of 0.65@xmath31 in position angle 210@xmath32 .",
    "however , it is much fainter than the 0.9@xmath31 companion and has neglible effect on the @xmath11 and @xmath12 light curves of cal  87 at all phases . ) in our analysis of 571 macho data points we have removed 24 individual points with very large errors ( @xmath33 mag ) and 7 which which lie @xmath34 mag from the light curve , since these are obviously misidentifications or blended images ( cal 87 lies in a very crowded field ) .",
    "this resulted in 540 remaining ( @xmath0 ) points well distributed in orbital phase .",
    "we have combined the data into 50 bins which are plotted versus phase in figure  [ color ] .",
    "the error bars shown are the standard error of the mean .",
    "it is clear that when the correction is made for the superimposed field star there is ( @xmath0 ) color change with phase , even during eclipse .",
    "we have also examined the ( @xmath0)-color curve for individual years and for extreme eclipse - depth values .",
    "again , the ( @xmath0)@xmath25 shows no variation with orbital phase .    if there is no change in the ( @xmath0 ) color through the orbital cycle , one might ask why the spectrum of the  eclipsed flux \" ( as shown in figure 1 ) is bluer than the out - of - eclipse light . in this paper",
    "we have only @xmath11 and @xmath12 photometry .",
    "since the hottest central regions of the disk are eclipsed , it may well be that a ( @xmath35 ) curve would show some variation with phase , but we do not have enough @xmath36 or @xmath37 photometry to test this . in principle",
    "we can use our spectra to measure color changes shortward of v - band , provided we remove the field star contamination , which is small at these wavelengths .",
    "doing so does suggest a small change in color in eclipse , but accurate photometry is required to measure it .    considering",
    "that the depth of eclipse changes without a corresponding change in the out - of - eclipse light and that there is no ( @xmath0 ) color change in the system through eclipse , the simplest explanation would be that the shape of the eclipsing body is changing .",
    "since the companion star is unlikely to change size , this idea then implies that the eclipse is caused by an occulting region on the accretion disk rather than the secondary star ( or perhaps a combination of these two ) .",
    "however , such a scenario seems very unlikely , given the long - term stability of the eclipse phasing .",
    "a more plausible possibility is that part of the eclipsed light comes from a hot spot on the outer part of the disk , as inferred in many cataclysmic variables .",
    "if the disk precesses , there may be periods when this hot spot is hidden during eclipse , but later becomes visible through eclipse when the angle between the disk and the observer has changed . in this picture",
    "the out - of - eclipse light would remain unchanged , as observed .",
    "in figure  [ lines ] we see that most lines show an increased equivalent width through the eclipse , indicating that the lines are eclipsed less than the continuum and thus must arise in an extended accretion disk .",
    "the exception is o vi 5290 , which becomes weaker near central eclipse , indicating that it is eclipsed more than the continuum and hence is formed in the innermost part of the disk .",
    "the emission - line strengths of he ii and h show an asymmetry around eclipse indicating extra flux is present in phases @xmath10.70.9 ( see figure  [ lines ] ) .",
    "the ratio of he ii 4686  to h drops through these phases , suggesting that the extra flux is greater in the balmer lines than in he ii 4686  ( or that more he ii 4686  is hidden than h ) .",
    "the o vi line strength is unchanged over all phases other than during central eclipse .",
    "the continuum is eclipsed by a factor @xmath14.5 , which is approximately the equivalent - width increase of h@xmath9 and h@xmath10 .",
    "thus , the balmer emission region is essentially uneclipsed and must be very large with respect to the secondary star .",
    "he ii 4686  is eclipsed to 50% of its out - of - eclipse level , and he ii 5411  is eclipsed to @xmath3840% of it usual level .",
    "the pickering he ii lines ( as shown by 5411 ) are eclipsed over a shorter phase interval , and the eclipse profile is narrower than for h and he ii 4686 .",
    "o vi is also eclipsed over a short interval to @xmath15% of its out - of - eclipse level .",
    "these changes imply that the central hottest region , where o vi is formed , is eclipsed almost totally while the balmer emission mostly originates in a large region which is only barely eclipsed .",
    "best - fit sine curves for different sets of radial - velocity data are shown in table 3 .",
    "there appear to be several different phase - related velocity variations .",
    "velocities that represent purely orbital motion of the compact star should have maximum velocity at phase 0.75 , assuming that mid - eclipse corresponds to superior conjunction of the compact star .",
    "however , the values in table 3 clearly show that the situation is more complicated , with variable line profiles and non - orbital motions contributing to the observed velocities .    in our original paper ( csch )",
    "we used he ii 4686  emission - line velocities to derive the stellar masses , with the orbital inclination being constrained by the light curve .",
    "the velocities showed k@xmath640 km s@xmath5 , with phasing which showed the emission came from the region around the compact star .",
    "these velocities implied a high - mass degenerate star , much larger than a massive white dwarf .",
    "the 1996 spectra reveal that both the phasing and velocity amplitude of this line have changed , as shown table 3 .",
    "depending on what part of the line is measured ( broad base or peak ) the semi - amplitude lies in the range",
    "@xmath39 km s@xmath5 , which implies even larger masses . however , the maximum velocity occurs at @xmath40 which is earlier than would be expected if the velocities were only due to orbital motion .",
    "if one ignores the measurements near eclipse ( phases 0.90.1 ) , as there could be some rotational distortion in the velocity curve due to different parts of the disk being eclipsed at different phases , the maximum velocity moves to phase @xmath10.65 , but the amplitude becomes even smaller , making derived masses still higher .",
    "however , the phasing indicates there is some contribution to he ii 4686  which is non - orbital and calls into question whether we are able to determine the true orbital velocities and hence derive stellar masses from velocities of this line .",
    "we note that he ii 4686  shows a systemic velocity of @xmath18273 km s@xmath5 , consistent with cal 87 being a member of the lmc .",
    "the he ii 4686  line shows asymmetries that may be partially due to superimposed weak absorption components , similar to those seen at the hydrogen lines .",
    "the h absorptions were much stronger in the 1996 spectra than in previous years .",
    "( he ii 4686  differs from the he ii pickering - series lines which do not show this asymmetry . )",
    "a blended absorption will have the greatest effect on the measured emission velocity when it is strongest and off to one side .",
    "this occurs at phases near @xmath41 and @xmath42 , so correction of the emission velocities for the presence of absorption will have the effect of increasing the velocity amplitude and causing the maximum velocity to occur later in phase .",
    "the sine - curve fit to the ` h@xmath9 ' emission velocities is shown in figure 5 and table 3 .",
    "the amplitude is larger than for he ii ( k@xmath43 km s@xmath5 ) and the phasing later than expected from pure orbital motion . from the variation in the strength of hydrogen emissions through eclipse",
    "we have already determined that they are formed in a very large region , and hence they are probably not good indicators of the compact star s motion .",
    "notice that the systemic velocity for this line is @xmath177 km s@xmath5 more negative than that of he ii , when the h@xmath9 wavelength is used to compute the velocity .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the line being a blend of h@xmath9 and he ii 6560  rather than pure hydrogen .",
    "all of the o vi lines are too weak be measured on individual spectra , and the 3800  lines are very noisy .",
    "measurements made on the phase - binned spectra of o vi 5290  show a semi - amplitude k@xmath44 km s@xmath5 , but because the error is large this value should be taken with caution .",
    "a formal fit to velocities gives a maximum at phase @xmath450.11 which , given the large uncertainty , is consistent with the expected maximum at @xmath46 for a line formed near the compact star . because the 5290line appears to be blended with an unidentified feature on its long - wavelength side , we have not been able to determine a reliable value for its systemic velocity .",
    "the negatively displaced v@xmath47 values of the balmer absorption lines show that they arise in gas flowing away from the system , with the velocity component in our direction being @xmath180 km s@xmath5 more negative than the mean he ii 4686  emission velocity .",
    "because we view the system near to the disk plane , this outflow is in all azimuthal directions , albeit with varying column density ( see figure  [ circle ] ) .",
    "thus , we appear to be viewing the system through a wind that has some azimuthal density and velocity variation .",
    "the absorbing medium evidently changes over timescales of years , and this change may be connected with the eclipse depth variations .",
    "an azimuthally symmetrical wind velocity would require the observed velocity change with phase to be orbital , but there may be some wind velocity change with azimuth as well , although such a wind would have to have spiral structure with respect to the disk . because the absorption is weakest during eclipse , the absorbing gas must be physically close to the disk .",
    "the entire balmer absorption phenomenon appears to be different from what is seen in the supersoft x - ray binary smc 13 ( crampton et al .",
    "1997 ) , where the velocity amplitude is much higher than can reasonably be due to orbital motion .",
    "the balmer absorptions clearly have a larger velocity amplitude than the emissions , as they move from one side to the other of the emission peaks .",
    "the absorption velocities are similar for h@xmath10 , h@xmath48 , and h@xmath49 , showing k=73 km s@xmath5 and phasing consistent with orbital motion of the compact star",
    ". however , figure 5 shows the velocities are very scattered , and with only six values it is very uncertain if they vary smoothly through the orbital cycle .",
    "a very weak ca ii - k absorption line is seen in all phase - binned spectra .",
    "it may also be formed in an outflow region , as v@xmath47 is 4070 km s@xmath5 lower than for he ii emission . like h absorption , this feature was not seen in spectra obtained in earlier years . the mean ca ii - k equivalent width ( @xmath11.1 ) shows little change with phase , except for at @xmath50=0 ( ew=1.8 ) and @xmath50=0.5 ( ew=1.6 ) .",
    "thus , the ca ii absorbing column does not change much around the orbit , but it is somewhat higher near conjunctions .",
    "the maximum velocity of ca ii - k absorption occurs at an earlier phase ( @xmath510.45 ) than for any other lines , and its amplitude is the highest measured ( k=97 km s@xmath5 ) . if the velocity measured at the eclipse phase is ignored , then this result is even more extreme ( k@xmath6155 km s@xmath5 ) but with the same phasing .",
    "the origin of this line is not at all clear .",
    "figure  [ circle ] shows a sketch of the orbit plane and summarizes the observed spectral changes .",
    "the balmer absorption appears to be strongest in phases 0.050.23 and 0.60.7 and weakest at phase @xmath10.4 and during central eclipse .",
    "the phasing of its velocity variations implies association with the accretion disk , but the changing strength of the absorption shows the column density varies with phase .",
    "since absorption is not seen in the he ii pickering or other lines , their velocities should be more reliable than the blended h and he ii emission lines for determining the motion of the compact star .",
    "however , their weakness makes them very difficult to measure reliably .",
    "we have discovered that the photometric eclipse depth has changed over recent years , and this variation may even be cyclic .",
    "the increase of light observed at mid - eclipse may be due to a geometrical change in the disk structure , without a significant change in total luminosity  such as a bright structure above or below the disk plane .",
    "alternatively , the disk may grow in size in its plane , accompanied by extra absorption due to the outflowing material , along lines - of - sight near the center .",
    "the emergence of the balmer absorption in the 1996 spectra suggests the latter scenario .    in 1994",
    "november we obtained three optical spectra of cal 87 which were reported by hutchings et al .",
    "( 1995 ) in their discussion of eight ultraviolet spectra observed by hst in 1995 january .",
    "we have remeasured the optical spectra , although they are of considerably lower quality than the new data and only show the strongest lines . in 19945",
    "he ii 4686and 1640  emission - line velocities show a very different phasing ( maximum velocity near @xmath52 ) and higher amplitude ( k@xmath170 km s@xmath5 ) compared to both the csch data ( k=40 km s@xmath5 ) and present data ( k@xmath130 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "the equivalent width of 4686  was lower in the 1994 spectra than in 1996 by a factor of nearly two . in two of the three 1994 optical spectra",
    "weak absorption features are visible at h@xmath10 and h@xmath48 , similar to those seen in 1996 , but the low s / n make the velocities unreliable .",
    "thus , it appears that there are long - term spectral changes that may include significant non - orbital motions .",
    "the o vi lines might give a clean measure of orbital motion , as they arise in the inner disk , but they are very weak , resulting in a large velocity scatter . the measured velocity amplitude ( k=35 km s@xmath5 ) leads to the same conclusion as csch , that the compact star must be massive , with m@xmath34m@xmath2 .",
    "if instead the velocity amplitude of the compact star is shown by the balmer absorption lines ( k=73 km s@xmath5 ) , then the resulting mass diagram is almost identical to that of the supersoft binary smc 13 ( crampton et al .",
    "1997 ) and lower masses are determined .",
    "we have argued above that the measured he ii velocity amplitude may be somewhat lower than the actual velocity of the compact star , because the phasing of absorptions will decrease the apparent velocity extremes , while non - orbital motions within the system add at other phases .",
    "we point out that the he ii velocities in csch , when the eclipse was deeper , gave k=40 km s@xmath5 .",
    "the balmer - line velocities are also likely to contain some non - orbital motions .",
    "thus k=73 km s@xmath5 is a reasonable upper limit for the motion of the degenerate star .",
    "figure  [ mass ] shows the resulting masses corresponding to these two extreme k values .",
    "the masses are constrained by the fairly well - known inclination ( @xmath53 ) and by the requirement that the mass - losing star fills its roche lobe .",
    "no main sequence star fills the roche lobe defined by these plots , for orbital inclinations larger than @xmath130@xmath54 .",
    "thus , the mass - losing star must have evolved off the main sequence to cause mass - exchange .",
    "the lowest mass that can thus evolve within a hubble time is @xmath1 0.4 m@xmath2 , and these are marked in the diagram at the appropriate inclination value .",
    "these therefore correspond to the lowest x - ray star masses under these assumptions , and just allow a white dwarf in the k=73 km s@xmath5 case .",
    "it may be possible that the mass - losing star has very low mass by having lost most of it in some earlier event , and is still filling its roche lobe now .",
    "however , in any of these cases the x - ray star is more massive and the resulting masses are not those expected by the ` standard ' model ( e.g. van den heuvel et al .  1992 ) in which it is assumed that the compact star is a @xmath11m@xmath2 white dwarf and the donor star has a mass of @xmath12.0 m@xmath2 .    the spectrum in eclipse shows no signs of a late type spectrum ( see figures  [ med ] ,  [ binned ] ,  [ bin2 ] ) , consistent with the absence of an evolved more massive secondary .",
    "unfortunately , the complex changes in the disk spectrum make it difficult to be more definitive than this at present , but it appears advisable to revisit the evolutionary scenarios to accomodate a mass - losing star that is less massive than the compact star , not only in cal 87 but also for the other supersoft x - ray binaries .",
    "we discuss separately ( cowley et al.1998 ) the overall mass determinations for a number of supersoft binary systems .    some of the supersoft x - ray binaries have been found to have highly displaced lines indicating the presence of ` jets ' .",
    "these are most noticable in two low - inclination systems rx j0513@xmath5569 ( crampton et al.1996 ) and cal 83 ( crampton et al .  1987 ) where the displacements are several thousand kilometers per second . in the intermediate inclination system",
    "rx j0019@xmath1822 the jets show a velocity of @xmath56800 km s@xmath5 from the central emission line .",
    "the jet lines move with the same phase and velocity amplitude as the central line , suggesting that the motion of he ii 4686  emission is indeed orbital .",
    "since cal 87 is viewed nearly edge - on , any line emission coming from such jets would have a very low radial velocity and thus not be separated from the central emission profile .",
    "the asymmetry seen in the he ii 4686  line of cal 87 could arise from a pair of shifted lines which have larger amplitude ( or possibly slightly different phase ) than the central line .",
    "this would imply that the central line motion is not entirely orbital , but without better resolution this suggestion can not be verified .    it is a pleasure to thank the ctio staff for their assistance during our observing runs .",
    "we also thank dr .",
    "douglas welch for considerable assistance with the macho data .",
