    "they generalize well - known classes of surfaces such as incompressible surfaces , strongly irreducible surfaces and critical surfaces @xcite , @xcite , and share nice properties .",
    "for example , if a @xmath0-manifold contains a topologically minimal surface and an incompressible surface , then the two surfaces can be isotoped so that any intersection loop is essential on both surfaces .    in this paper , we show that any @xmath0-manifold containing an incompressible surface has topologically minimal surfaces of arbitrary high genus .",

    "so we can define a retraction @xmath42 , which sends all compressing disks in @xmath37 to some fixed compressing disk @xmath43 in @xmath37 and sends @xmath40 to @xmath40 .",

    "also in the case that @xmath55 is empty , @xmath14 can be regarded as a compressing disk for @xmath46 in @xmath39 .",
    "now we define a map @xmath64 , which extends @xmath48 .",
    "the disks @xmath43 and @xmath40 are disjoint from the compressing disks of @xmath12 .",

    "consider the smallest @xmath7 such that @xmath70 contains an image by @xmath71 of some @xmath69 .",
    "suppose that there are two such disks @xmath72 and @xmath73 of @xmath14 , i.e. both @xmath74 and @xmath75 are contained in @xmath76 .",
    "there are only two vertices in @xmath76 .",

    "( in fact , we are assuming that inductively @xmath71 is defined in this manner . )",
    "so if we define @xmath78 to be @xmath74 , it is well - defined .    for a disk belonging to type @xmath79 , we define its image by @xmath80 to be @xmath43 .",
    "a disk @xmath13 belonging to type @xmath63 can be regarded as a compressing disk for @xmath46 in @xmath37 .",
    "we define @xmath81 to be @xmath82 .",
    "so far , @xmath80 is defined on vertices of @xmath53 .",
    "to prove the claim is equivalent to show that @xmath80 sends two disjoint disks of @xmath53 to disjoint disks of @xmath66 or to the same disk .",
    "there are several cases to consider according to the types of the two disks .",

    "in particular , @xmath72 and @xmath73 can be chosen to be disjoint .",
    "see figure [ fig4 ] . hence @xmath91 and @xmath92 are disjoint or isotopic .            because higher dimensional simplices of @xmath53 are determined by its @xmath41-skeleton , the map @xmath80 can be extended to all of @xmath53 .",

    "@xmath46 is not strongly irreducible , so the topological index of @xmath46 is at least two .",
