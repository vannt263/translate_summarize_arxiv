    "in the last few years the study of the diffuse x - ray background ( xrb ) has witnessed significant observational progress allowing detailed comparison with model predictions .",
    "the ultra - deep _ chandra _ surveys in particular , have demonstrated that most of the xrb , at both soft and hard energies , is resolved into discrete point sources ( brandt et al .",
    "2001 ; giaconni et al . 2002 ; alexander et al .",
    "2003 ) , the vast majority of which are without doubt agns . to the first approximation , this finding has been a huge success for models that reproduce the spectral properties of the xrb under the zero order assumption that it originates in a combination of obscured and unobscured agn ( comastri et al . 1995 ; gilli , salvati & hasinger 2001 ) . under more careful examination however , a number of inconsistencies emerge .",
    "firstly , luminous ( @xmath9 ) heavily obscured type - ii qsos at @xmath10 , predicted in large numbers by the models , are scarce in the surveys above .",
    "secondly , the redshift peak of the x - ray population lies below @xmath11 in stark contrast with the model expectation of @xmath10 .",
    "although these inconsistencies suggest that some revision of the models is almost certainly required ( hasinger 2003 ) , observational biases may complicate any interpretation .",
    "for example , about @xmath12 per cent of the sources in the _ chandra _ deep fields ( cdf ) are optically faint , @xmath13mag , rendering optical spectroscopy difficult or even impossible with current technology ( rosati et al .",
    "2002 ; barger et al .",
    "any information about the nature of these sources is therefore limited and they are proposed as best candidates for heavily obscured agn ( alexander et al .",
    "2001 ; treister et al .",
    "2004 ) , likely to comprise a fraction the elusive population of high-@xmath14 type - ii qsos .",
    "moreover , the small field - of - view of the cdfs ( 0.07deg@xmath15 each ) makes them sensitive to cosmic variance further complicating interpretation of the derived redshift distribution .",
    "wide - area shallower ( @xmath16 ) surveys are less affected by the observational biases above ( e.g. baldi et al .",
    "2002 ; kim et al . 2004 ; georgantopoulos et al . 2004 ) .",
    "these samples although of key importance , comprise a large fraction of unobscured agns that are not representative of the sources responsible for the spectral shape of the xrb ( @xmath17 ; e.g. gruber et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the evidence above suggests that deep surveys with relatively wide field - of - view are essential to improve our understanding of the xrb .",
    "observational programs in this direction",
    "are already well underway such as the _ xmm - newton _ cosmic evolution survey [ cosmos ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the extended _ chandra _ deep field south [ e - cdf - s ; lehmer et al . 2005 ; virani , treister & urry 2006 ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 . in this paper",
    "we present results on a single 200ks _",
    "chandra _ pointing , which is part of an on - going x - ray survey in the extended groth strip region , which will eventually cover a total area of about 0.5deg@xmath15 to the depth above ( 200ks per pointing ) .",
    "this sample , when completed , will be intermediate in terms of area coverage and depth to the cdfs and shallower wide - area surveys , minimising any observational biases affecting the ultra - deep fields and comprising a large fraction of obscured agns responsible of the xrb properties ( nandra et al . 2005 ) .",
    "moreover , the extended groth strip is targeted by the largest space and ground - based facilities for multiwavelength observations : ( i ) the deep and deep2 surveys provide optical spectroscopy to the limit @xmath22mag , ( ii ) multiwaveband optical photometry to fainter magnitudes is underway as part of the canada france hawaii telescope legacy survey , ( iii ) deep imaging and spectroscopy , independent from the programs above , has been performed by steidel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) in search for lyman break galaxies , ( iv ) comprehensive imaging with hst / acs has recently been completed , ( v ) _ spitzer _ mid - ir data are available , ( vi ) radio observations to sub - mjy levels have been obtained by fomalont et al .",
    "( 1991 ) with new much wider vla observations recently completed , ( vii ) scuba has observed part of this field to the deep limits of the canada - uk deep submillimetre survey ( webb et al .",
    "a combination of the x - ray observations with the mutliwavelength datasets above promises a breakthrough in the study of the evolution and large scale structure of agns as well as the connection between agn activity and host galaxy formation .",
    "this paper presents the optical and x - ray spectral properties of the sources detected in the first 200ks _ chandra _ pointing observed as part of the extended groth strip x - ray survey .",
    "this observation encompasses the original groth - westphal strip region ( groth et al .",
    "in addition to studying the properties of the x - ray sources in the context of xrb models , our purpose is to demonstrate the power of the full @xmath23 extended groth strip _ chandra _ survey , when completed , for xrb studies . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the x - ray data used in this paper are from the a03 _ chandra _ observations of the original groth westphal strip ( gws ) , which is part of the extended groth strip ( egs ) region .",
    "the total exposure time is about 190ks split into 3 separate integrations obtained at different epochs .",
    "all 3 observations were obtained with the acis - i instrument ( @xmath27 ) with a similar roll - angle at the aimpoint , @xmath28 = 14:17:43.6 , @xmath2952:28:41.2 . a detailed description of the data reduction , source detection and flux estimation has been presented by nandra et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "briefly , standard reduction methods were applied using the ciao version 3.0.1 data analysis software . after merging the individual observations into a single event file , we constructed images in 4 energy bands 0.5 - 7.0kev ( full ) , 0.5 - 2.0kev ( soft ) , 2.0 - 7.0kev ( hard ) and 4.0 - 7.0kev ( ultra - hard ) .",
    "source detection was performed using a simple but efficient method which is based on pre - selection of candidate sources using the wavdetect task of ciao followed by aperture count extraction using the 90 per cent point spread function ( psf ) radius and a local background determination to estimate the source significance .",
    "the final catalogue used in this paper comprises a total of 158 sources over a total surveyed area of @xmath30 to a poisson detection probability threshold @xmath31 . of these sources",
    "a total of 155 , 121 , 97 , and 44 are detected in the full , soft , hard and ultra - hard bands respectively .",
    "fluxes are estimated by integrating the net counts within an aperture corresponding to the 70 per cent encircled energy radius at the position of the source .",
    "the counts in the full , soft , hard and ultra - hard bands are converted into fluxes in standard bands , 0.5 - 10 , 0.5 - 2 , 2 - 10 and 5 - 10kev respectively . the limiting flux in each of these bands",
    "is estimated @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the main photometric catalogue used in this paper for the optical identification of the x - ray sources is the deep2 survey of the egs that also overlaps with the original gws field .",
    "the deep2 survey photometric data were obtained at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) using the @xmath36 pixel ccd mosaic camera providing a @xmath37 field of view per pointing .",
    "the observations were performed in the @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 filters .",
    "the data reduction , source detection , photometric and astrometric calibration as well as the star - galaxy separation are described in coil et al .",
    "the pointing that overlaps with the _ chandra _ x - ray data used here is nearly complete to @xmath41mag ( @xmath42 , @xmath43mag ) .",
    "this is shallower than the nominal limit of the full deep2 egs survey ( @xmath44mag ) because of poorer seeing conditions ( about 0.95arcsec ) at the time of the observations ( coil et al .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of the photometric catalogue is estimated to be 0.5arcsec and is limited by systematic errors of the usno - a catalogue used to determine the astrometric solution .",
    "the gws also overlaps with the ongoing deep synoptic canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) .",
    "this project uses the wide field imager megaprime equipped with the megacam ccd array providing a @xmath45 field of view . in this paper",
    "we use the first data obtained as part of the deep synoptic survey in the @xmath1 filters . the exposure times in each waveband range from 113 hours",
    "( depending on the filter ) corresponding to about 29 per cent of the target integration at the completion of the project .",
    "the data reduction , source detection , photometric and astrometric calibration will be presented in a future paper . in brief",
    "the elixir package was used for the reduction as well as the initial photometric and astrometric calibration , which were then refined using our own routines .",
    "the final astrometric uncertainty is estimated to be about 0.3arcsec .",
    "the photometric accuracy is found to be better than 0.05mag in all filters while the completeness limit in the ab system is @xmath0mag ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49mag ) . although the cfhtls deep synoptic dataset reaches fainter limits that the deep2 , we prefer to use the latter at present as the basic photometric catalogue because of its homogeneity and the well documented observational properties of this survey ( e.g. coil et al . 2004 ; faber et al .",
    "2005 ; willmer et al .",
    "we nevertheless use the multi - waveband photometry of the cfhtls primarily to estimate photometric redshifts but also to search for x - ray source optical counterparts that are fainter than the deep2 limit .",
    "finally , the gws has been targeted for deep optical imaging as part of a larger program searching for lyman break galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "the observations were performed at the kitt peak 4 m mayall telescope using the prime focus ccd camera ( @xmath50 field of view ) in the @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 filters . because of the smaller field - of - view of these observations the outer edges of x - ray pointing do not overlap with the optical image .",
    "a detailed description is presented by steidel et al .",
    "the astrometry is accurate to about 0.4arcsec and the photometric internal scatter is estimated to be better than 0.03mag in all filters .",
    "these observations reach a limiting magnitude @xmath54mag , similar to the cfhtls .",
    "they are used here primarily to estimate photometric redshifts using the lyman break selection criteria . as discussed by steidel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , these methods are very efficient in identifying galaxies in narrow redshift slices in the range @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the @xmath39-band filters used in the above three datasets are similar and therefore , there is good agreement in the estimated @xmath39-band magnitudes of the same object among the different surveys .",
    "the main source of optical spectroscopy in this study is the deep2 redshift survey .",
    "this is an ongoing project that uses the deimos spectrograph on the 10 m keck ii telescope aiming to obtain redshifts for about 40000 galaxies in the range @xmath56 to a limiting magnitude @xmath57mag .",
    "the spectra are obtained with a high resolution grating ( 1200l / mm , @xmath58 ) and span the wavelength range @xmath59 .",
    "this spectral window allows the identification of the oii emission line in the redshift interval @xmath60 . outside this range",
    "the ability to measure redshifts and hence , the completeness of the deep2 , drops significantly .",
    "the data reduction was performed using an idl based pipeline developed at uc - berkeley ( cooper et al .",
    "2006 ) and adapted from reduction programs created for the sdss .",
    "the gws has also been targeted by a number of spectroscopic programs ( lilly 1995 ; brinchmann et al .",
    "1998 ; hopkins et al . 2000 ; voght et al .",
    "2005 ) that have been compiled into a single database by weiner et al .",
    "the entire egs overlaps with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and therefore spectra for relatively bright galaxies and qsos are also available ( york et al . 2000 ) .",
    "in addition to the above surveys steidel et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2004 ) performed follow - up multi - slit spectroscopy of the gws lyman break galaxies as well as some x - ray sources using the lris - b on the keck telescopes .",
    "the observations used a 300line / mm grating blazed at @xmath61 leading to a dispersion of 2.47 / pixel , a wavelength range that included at least the @xmath62 regime and a nominal spectral resolution of about @xmath63 .",
    "the total integration time varied between 1.5 - 3h ( depending on the observing conditions ) , split into 1800s sub - exposures followed by a dither of the telescope in the slit direction .",
    "the data were reduced using a custom package based on iraf scripts . a total of 10 sources in our sample have redshift measurements from these observations .",
    "the main catalogue used to optically identify the gws x - ray sources is the deep2 survey .",
    "we first search for systematic offsets between the astrometric solutions of the x - ray and optical catalogues . a matching radius of 2arcsec is adopted to include only secure optical identifications .",
    "we also consider x - ray sources with off - axis angles @xmath64arcmin ( total of 86 ) where the _ chandra _ psf is superior with a 90 per cent encircled energy radius of @xmath654arcsec .",
    "a total of 50 x - ray sources have optical identifications brighter than @xmath66mag .",
    "we estimate small systematic offsets of @xmath67 and @xmath68arcsec between the x - ray and optical source positions .",
    "these were then used to align the x - ray source catalogue to the deep2 astrometric solution .",
    "next we explore the positional accuracy of the x - ray centroid as a function of off - axis angle , @xmath69 .",
    "we match the x - ray and optical catalogues using an ample 5arcsec search radius to account for the degradation of the psf at large off - axis angles .",
    "figure [ fig_drra_vs_oaa ] plots the positional offset in ra and dec between the x - ray and optical source positions against @xmath69 .",
    "reassuringly , the mean x - ray  optical offset is close to zero at all off - axis angles but the @xmath70 rms increases from about 0.5arcsec at @xmath71arcmin to @xmath72arcsec at larger off - axis angles .",
    "we account for the degradation of the x - ray positional accuracy by varying the matching radius as a function of off - axis angle .",
    "for @xmath73arcmin we use a radius of 1.5arcsec , corresponding to the @xmath74 rms scatter around the mean . for @xmath75arcmin the matching radius increases to 3arcsec , the @xmath74 rms positional uncertainty at these off - axis angles .",
    "the surface density of optical sources to the limit @xmath76mag is large enough that a substantial fraction of chance associations is expected within the above radii .",
    "we account for this effect by estimating the poissonian probability , @xmath77 , that a given optical counterpart is spurious alignment following the method of downes et al .",
    "given the surface density of objects brighter than @xmath78 , @xmath79 , the expected number of candidates within @xmath80 is @xmath81 . assuming that source positions are poissonian , the probability of at least one object brighter than @xmath78 within radius @xmath80 is @xmath82 . in practice",
    "one has to apply a cutoff in @xmath77 to limit the optical identifications to those candidates that are least likely to be spurious alignments .",
    "the probability @xmath77 however , is estimated under the assumption that the source positions are uniformly distributed within the surveyed area .",
    "for the real clustered distribution of optical sources we assess the fraction of spurious optical identifications for different probability cutoffs using mock x - ray catalogues constructed by randomising the positions of the x - ray sources within the area covered by the _ chandra _",
    "the optical identification method is performed on the mock catalogues using the same criteria ( e.g. matching radius ) as for the real sources .",
    "this procedure is repeated 500 times . when constructing random x - ray catalogues we maintain the spatial distribution of the sources due to both vignetting and real clustering .",
    "this is accomplished by applying offsets in the range 30 - 60arcsec to the x - ray source positions around their original centroid .",
    "figure [ fig_prob_vs_numids ] plots the cumulative distribution of optical identifications for the full - band x - ray selected sample ( using the matching radius scheme described above ) as a function of probability cutoff .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig_prob_vs_numids ] is the expected number of spurious counterparts estimated as described above .",
    "this figure shows that the number of optically identified sources reaches a plateau at @xmath83 per cent while the spurious identification rate further increases with @xmath77 .",
    "based on figure [ fig_prob_vs_numids ] we adopt a cutoff probability @xmath84 per cent for optical identification in the case of off - axis angles @xmath64arcmin . because of the degradation of the positional accuracy at larger off - axis angles we relax the probability cutoff to @xmath85 for sources with @xmath86arcmin .",
    "this is to minimise the fraction of missed optical identifications because of the poor x - ray positions . for an optical source with @xmath76mag",
    "the probabilities @xmath84 and @xmath85 per cent correspond to maximum separations between the optical and x - ray centroids of about 1 and 1.5arcsec respectively . repeating the simulations above using the off - axis dependent identification scheme we estimate a spurious fraction of about 4.5 per cent .",
    "the choice of @xmath77 is a trade - off between maximum number of optical counterparts and minimum contamination rate .",
    "similar results and false identification rates are obtained for the soft , hard and ultra - hard samples .    for x - ray sources with no optical identification to the deep2 magnitude limit or outside the deep2 field - of - view we use the cfhtls to search for fainter optical counterparts applying the same selection criteria described above .",
    "moreover , a number of optically faint x - ray sources lie in the gaps between the ccds of the megacam mosaic . for these sources we use the steidel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) deep optical imaging to search for optical identifications .",
    "considering sources fainter than the deep2 magnitude limit increases the spurious fraction rate by about 2 per cent .",
    "a total of 29 sources are identified with galaxies from the cfhtls or the steidel et al .",
    "( 2003 ) survey .",
    "table [ tab_ids ] summarises the identification statistics for different x - ray selected subsamples .",
    "table [ tab_optical ] presents the optical properties of the gws x - ray sources as well as the source of optical photometry .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts are available for a total of 51 sources .",
    "these are classified into 3 groups on the basis of their optical spectroscopic properties ( primarily from deep1 and deep2 ) following methods described in sarajedini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) : broad emission - line galaxies , narrow emission - line sources and systems with absorption lines . for broad emission line agn",
    "we adopt the criterion @xmath87 .",
    "we note that the low s / n ratio of some of the spectra and the small spectral window of the deep2 observations ( @xmath88 ) introduce some uncertainty in the classification scheme above .",
    "in addition to the above three groups , a number of sources in the sample can not be classified because the optical spectra were not available for visual inspection .    for x - ray sources without spectroscopic",
    "identification we estimate photometric redshifts exploiting the multiwaveband photometry ( @xmath1 ) of the cfhtls .",
    "determining photometric redshifts for x - ray sources is challenging because of the significant , if not dominant , agn component contributing to the optical broad - band colours ( e.g. babbedge et al .",
    "2005 ; kitsionas et al .",
    "recent studies however , suggest that many moderate luminosity agn ( @xmath89 ) as well as obscured x - ray sources have optical continuum emission that is dominated by stellar light thus , allowing galaxy templates to be used for photometric redshifts ( barger et al .",
    "2003 ; gandhi et al .",
    "2004 ; georgakakis et al .",
    "2004 ; georgakakis et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we explore this possibility using the photometric redshift code of gwyn ( 2001 ) based on a standard @xmath90 minimisation method .",
    "the galaxy templates are based on those of coleman , wu & widman ( 1980 ) , providing seds for 4 main spectral galaxy types ( e / s0 , sbc , scd , i m ) , extended in the uv and ir wavelength regions using the gissel98 code ( e.g. bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "these are supplemented with the starburst sb2 and sb3 spectra from kinney et al .",
    "having only a small number of seds can cause aliasing in photometric redshifts .",
    "therefore , a new template set has been created by smoothly interpolating between each of the six original spectra .",
    "this results in a total 51 seds from ellipticals ( spectral classification 0 ) to extreme starbursts ( spectral classification 1 ) .",
    "figure [ fig_zz ] compares the photometric and spectroscopic redshift estimates for the sources with available spectroscopic observations . with the exception of broad - line qsos , for which galaxy templates are inappropriate for photometric redshift estimates",
    ", there is fair agreement between @xmath91 and @xmath92 with an rms scatter , after excluding broad - line agn , @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the total number of sources .",
    "this is further demonstrated in figure [ fig_dz_colour ] plotting @xmath95 against @xmath96 colour .",
    "sources bluer than @xmath97 are dominated by broad - line qsos and show significant scatter in their photometric redshift determination ( e.g. barger et al . 2003 ; kitsionas et al .",
    "2005 ) . for systems redder than this limit",
    "however , the photometric redshifts are more reliable .",
    "to avoid erroneous redshift estimates in the analysis that follows we use photometric redshifts only for sources with @xmath98mag .",
    "in addition to the standard photometric redshift estimation above , we exploit the lyman break galaxy selection available for the gws ( steidel et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) to determine the redshift of a small number of x - ray sources .",
    "this method has been shown to be very efficient in identifying galaxies in well defined narrow redshift slices within the range @xmath99 with a low interloper rate . here",
    "we use the bm , bx , c , d , m and md lyman break galaxy selection criteria fully described in steidel et al .",
