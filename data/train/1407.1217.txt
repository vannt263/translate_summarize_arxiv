    "the knowledge that floton - like mean - field solutions do indeed have a faithful @xmath0-particle counterpart would be quite valuable .",
    "however , there is still another catch .",
    "namely , with increasing particle number  @xmath0 and correspondingly decreasing effective planck constant @xmath132 the system is able to explore its phase space on ever finer scales , and ultimately `` feels '' that the resonant island does not represent perfectly integrable dynamics , but rather is subject to the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) scenario : the invariant flow tubes with not sufficiently irrational winding numbers are destroyed  @xcite . but this means that , in a strict mathematical sense , the question arises whether or not the quantization curves @xmath90 required by the naive bohr - sommerfeld condition  ( [ eq : sqp ] ) actually are available  if not , the order parameter should be degraded .",
    "since the answer to this question depends sensitively on the precise value of @xmath116 , and therefore on the precise particle number  @xmath0 , one has to expect strong fluctuations of the system s coherence under small variations of  @xmath0 , once @xmath0 becomes sufficiently large .    ,",
    "taken over all respective floquet states , as function of the particle number  @xmath0 . once again , the system parameters are @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath117 . for comparison ,",
    "the black line shows @xmath146 for the nondriven junction .",
    "observe the scale of the inset!,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    this expectation is confirmed in an impressive manner by fig .",
    "[ f_10 ] , which shows the respective maximum @xmath147 of the @xmath142-values of all floquet states provided by the driven junction  ( [ eq : nph ] ) for a prescribed value of  @xmath0 , again for the same set of system parameters as employed before . indeed , at about @xmath148 fluctuations of @xmath147 start to make themselves felt , and become more pronounced with increasing @xmath0 ; the previous observation that @xmath147 is close to unity for @xmath129 now appears as a fortuitous coincidence .",
    "in contrast , such fluctuations do not occur for the undriven junction  ( [ eq : ubj ] ) , which merely gives rise to exactly integrable mean - field dynamics .",
    "such fluctuations of the order parameter constitute the fourth , and probably most important property of the floton , and lead to a hard , testable prediction : in a set of experiments with resonantly driven bose - einstein condensates , prepared under ostensibly identical conditions but still admitting a small uncertainty of the large particle number , there should be large shot - to - shot fluctuations of the condensate fraction .",
    "quantum resonances , as sketched in sec .",
    "[ sec : resonance ] , constitute a generic feature of driven nonlinear systems .",
    "therefore , the appearance of trojan quasiparticles which correspond , to good approximation , to an @xmath0-fold occupied time - periodic single - particle state is not restricted to the somewhat idealized model system  ( [ eq : nph ] ) .",
    "in particular , one may deliberately `` engineer '' such a resonance in an anharmonic single - well trapping potential which is combined with additional time - periodic forcing .",
    "a central question then is how such time - dependent condensates could be prepared . here",
    "a further insight becomes important : as emphasized by leggett  @xcite , the tendency to undergo bose - einstein condensation into a `` macroscopically '' occupied single - particle state is not restricted to states of thermal equilibrium .",
    "rather , it can be understood as a consequence of two mutually reinforcing effects : on the one hand , bosonic configurations in which many particles occupy the same single - particle orbital have a higher statistical weight than in the classical case ; on the other , the hartree - fock energy of two identical spinless bosons in different single - particle orbitals is greater than that of two such bosons in the same orbital  @xcite .",
    "hence , one may reasonably assume that a resonantly driven bose gas condenses `` by itself '' into the floton ground state @xmath86 when the parameters are chosen such that this floquet state becomes the one with the lowest mean energy .",
    "if so , the floton would manifest itself , _",
    "e.g. _ , as a clearly discernible condensate peak in a time - of - flight recording , at least as long as the particle number is not too large . because of the nonheating property",
    ", this signature should persist even after comparatively long driving times .",
    "but the true `` smoking gun '' ultimately betraying the floton might consist in fluctuations of the kind depicted in fig .",
    "[ f_10 ] : if the average particle number exceeds a certain value depending on the specific set - up , the height of the condensate peak observed in a series of time - of - flight experiments would fluctuate in a seemingly erratic manner from measurement to measurement .",
