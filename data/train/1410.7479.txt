    "non - linear interaction between electromagnetic fields can lead to the appearance of resonances with a bandwidth which is much narrower than the unperturbed natural linewidth .",

    "although there are similarities between eit and cpo , these effects are actually different in nature , and the properties of the non - linear response in each case are determined by different system parameters . for example , in the case of eit , the minimal bandwidth of the resonance is determined by the transverse relaxation rate of the two - photon transition , whereas in the case of cpo , the minimal bandwidth is determined by the effective longitudinal relaxation rate ; in the eit case , the resonance appears at zero two - photon detuning , whereas in the cpo case , the non - linear resonance is centered at the pump frequency .",
