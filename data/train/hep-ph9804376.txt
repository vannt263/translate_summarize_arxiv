    ". for negative values of @xmath164 the running coupling , @xmath212 , has a maximum , @xmath213 , at a finite value of the renormalization scale @xmath214 .",
    "this is because the dominant subleading term of the running coupling in the infrared is determined by @xmath164 , @xmath215 with @xmath216 and @xmath217 , it is clear that for @xmath218 the running coupling increases for smallest scales close to @xmath219 before higher order terms dominate .",
    "there necessarily has to be a maximum @xmath220 at some finite scale @xmath221 for any solution with @xmath218 .    for @xmath222",
    ", @xmath223 is the only maximum of the running coupling for all real values of the renormalization scale , and @xmath224 is thus a true infrared stable fixed point . comparing the behavior of the resulting gluon and ghost renormalization functions in the ultraviolet we observe that , for the @xmath222 solutions , the case @xmath225 yields the best resemblance of their one  loop anomalous dimensions .",
    "we therefore interpret the case @xmath177 as the most physical one and conceive the existence of solutions for @xmath226 as a mathematical peculiarity .    in reducing the dse for the gluon propagator to a one  dimensional equation we had to dismiss the contribution in order to avoid an artificial singular contribution .",
    "to asses whether this is justified we calculate the contribution from without the one  dimensional approximation from the gluon and ghost renormalization functions as obtained from the iterative scheme , i.e. , from the one  dimensional integral equations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dismissed ] the inverse gluon function is displayed as a measure of the terms retained on the r.h.s.of the one  dimensional equation ( [ odzdse ] ) .",
    "this is to be compared to the neglected contribution as calculated from the selfconsistent results .",
    "one clearly observes that the dismissed contribution remains small at all momenta and becomes negligible for small and large momenta quickly .",
    "although , in principle , even small contributions might become important in non  linear self  consistency problems this is rather convincing support for the omission of the terms in to which the one  dimensional approximation can not be applied .",
    "we have solved a set of two coupled non  linear integral equations .",
    "these solutions involve functions which are highly singular in the infrared .",
    "the corresponding infrared behavior has to be treated analytically by converting the integral equations into recursion relations for the coefficients of asymptotic expansions .",
    "the final numerical solution is obtained by matching the asymptotic expansions to an iteration process used for momenta above the matching point .",
    "the numerical algorithm described here was used in the solution of the coupled gluon ",
    "ghost dyson ",
    "schwinger equations reported in refs .",
    "@xcite for the first time .",
    "the resulting gluon and ghost propagators displayed a new type of infrared behavior involving irrational exponents of the momenta .",
    "this generic type of dse solutions for gluon and ghost propagators of the same qualitative form has been verified recently using a different truncation scheme and different numerical methods @xcite .",
    "we therefore believe that the algorithm presented here will prove useful in further studies of dyson ",
    "schwinger equations also .",
    "after defining the variables and setting the parameters @xmath227 etc.and the matching points @xmath65 and @xmath184 the functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 are initialized to @xmath228    the iteration process consists of several parts .",
    "the first is the evaluation of the constant @xmath145 ( see and ) using the functions determined in the previous iteration step . hereby eq .",
    "is used for large momenta .",
    "next , the contributions to the gluon and ghost equations due to the infrared region is calculated using the expansion in the asymptotic series . in the intermediate momentum",
    "range the integrals above the infrared matching point are computed numerically with the help of an simpson routine of fourth order using the mesh defined by eq .  .",
    "application of eqs .   to completes the iteration step .",
    "convergence is tested by comparing the input and output functions of an iteration step pointwise .",
    "if the maximum relative deviation is less than _ eps _ it is assumed that convergence is achieved , and the result is written to the file _",
    "gluonghost.out _ in three - column form : @xmath229 .",
    "function _ simpson _ + returns the integral of a function which is given at equally spaced abscissas .",
    "as far as the number of abscissas is sufficient this function uses a closed simpson rule of order @xmath230 @xcite .    function _ gamma _ + this routine returns the incomplete gamma function @xmath186 using a continued fraction as described in @xcite .",
    "naturally , trivial tests establishing the independence of the number of meshpoints , the infrared matching point @xmath65 , the ultraviolet cut - off @xmath184 and the order of the asymptotic series in the infrared have been performed .",
    "we could also verify that the results are independent of the initializing functions chosen at the beginning .",
