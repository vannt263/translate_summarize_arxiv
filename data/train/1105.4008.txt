    "these studies provide evidence that the  phenomenon occurs at sites of and are due to magnetic reconnection , and characteristically have elongated shapes reminiscent of the `` chromospheric anemone jets '' of @xcite .",
    "the present paper strengthens this case on the basis of observations that are far superior in quality to any in the literature , and establishes that  of the type seen here are rooted in the deep photosphere . in the remainder of this introduction we show and discuss a few illustrative examples , and then report more comprehensive measurements in the main body of the paper .                our observations , described in detail in section  [ sec : observations ] ,",

    "none seems to sense the more horizontal orientation of the overlying chromospheric fibrils that are observed at the center of ; * the  migrate , while flaring repetitively , along the pre - existing network , always away from the spot ; * there are very fast variations in their fine structure during the repetitive flaring ; * some of the brighter threads display small - scale inverted - y morphology ; * some  are accompanied by dark  surges .",
    "together , these properties define the  in this data set as photospheric events rooted in the network that produce eruptive jets reaching upward to considerable height , with fast temporal variations that suggest successive interaction of newly arriving vertical field with existing network field , most likely in the form of magnetic reconnection .",
    "photospheric reconnection has been suggested theoretically ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) but has not been estabished observationally .",
    "the present observations provide the clearest evidence to date .",
    "in the rest of the paper we detail the observations ( section  [ sec : observations ] ) and the methods used for the selection and measurements of  and other bright points ( section  [ sec : measurements ] ) . in section  [ sec : results ] we quantify the observed ellerman - bomb footpoint motions , extensions and retractions , their doppler signatures , and their fast variations .",
    "we also compare ellerman - bomb properties with those of non - eruptive network bright points and display one of the two cases with a surge .",

    "thirdly , six more slits  ii - vii are positioned by spacing them parallel to slit  i , sharing the same bends , at every 128 km in the approximate jet direction . slit  vii is then the furthest from the footpoint , at 768 km from slit  i. together , these slits represent samplings of the jet along its apparent height that track its footpoint path .",
    "they enable the construction of space - time plots for the wing brightness @xmath43 and wing dopplershift @xmath44 . in the latter , we found it necessary to mask off all areas that have wing brightness below 1400 ( in the arbitrary data units also used in figure  [ fig : ha - profiles ] ) because otherwise , overlying chromospheric fibrils dominate the doppler signature with their independent dopplershifts .",
    "in addition , for these dark features the dopplergram definition switches sign , causing extra confusion , as does their varying viewing angle with respect to the line of sight . by masking the dark fibrils off , the space - time doppler signature is much better constrained to display  properties only . finally , using these multi - slit space - time diagrams we derived the proper motion speed of all  feet , the extension and retraction speeds of all jets , and the spatial occurrence distributions along all  of their doppler signatures , as described in the next paragraphs .",

    "we suspect that exceedingly large thermal line width , as proposed by @xcite and particular to the balmer lines due to the small atomic mass of hydrogen , may be an important aspect .",

    "although multiple types of  and corresponding field configurations are reported in the literature , the ones reported here seem all to be photospheric events that are most likely explained by successive reconnection of strong vertical network fields with incoming , also vertical , field that is driven into the network by the moat flow .",
    "the  observations presented in this paper have one obvious shortcoming : there was no simultaneous polarimetry performed that would provide corresponding magnetograms at similar angular resolution .",
    "such data is required to study the topology and evolution of the magnetic fields at and around  sites to ascertain what happens magnetically , in particular to establish the presence and action of field emergence and cancelation and to chart the field polarity .",
