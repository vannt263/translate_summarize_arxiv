    "this paper treats a mathematical model for the temporal change of the proportions of individuals showing certain behavioral strategies .",
    "models of this kind are of special interest for a _ quantitative understanding _ or _",
    "prognosis _ of social developments . for the description of the _ competition _ or _",
    "cooperation _ in populations there already exist _ game theoretical approaches _ ( cf .",
    "e.g. von neumann and morgenstern , 1944 ; luce and raiffa , 1957 ; rapoport and chammah , 1965 ; axelrod , 1984 ) .",
    "in order to cope with time - dependent problems the method of _ iterated games _ has been developed and used for a long time .",
    "however , some years ago , the _ game dynamical equations _ have been discovered ( taylor and jonker , 1978 ; hofbauer et .",
    "al . , 1979 ;",
    "zeeman , 1980 ) .",
    "these are ordinary differential equations , which are related to the theory of evolution ( eigen , 1971 ; fisher , 1930 ; eigen and schuster , 1979 ; hofbauer and sigmund , 1988 ; feistel and ebeling , 1989 ) .",
    "therefore , one also speaks of _ evolutionary game theory_.    the game dynamical equations have the following advantages :    * they are continuous in time which is more adequate for many problems . *",
    "ordinary differential equations are easier to handle than iterated formulations . *",
    "analytical results can be derived more easily ( cf .",
    "e.g. hofbauer and sigmund , 1988 ; helbing , 1992 ) .    up to now",
    ", there only exists a _ `",
    "macroscopic ' _ foundation of the game dynamical equations , i.e. a derivation from a _ collective _ level of behavior ( cf .",
    "section [ macr ] ) . in this paper",
    "` microscopic ' _ foundation will be given , i.e. a derivation on the basis of the _ individual _ behavior . with this aim in view",
    ", we will first develop a _",
    "stochastic _ behavioral model for the following reasons :    * a stochastic model , i.e. a model that can describe random _ fluctuations _ of the quantities of interest , can cope with the fact that behavioral changes are not exactly predictable ( which is a consequence of the ` freedom of decision - making ' ) . * the phenomena appearing in the considered social system can be connected to the principles of _ individual _ behavior . as a consequence , processes on the ` macroscopic ' ( collective ) level can be understood as effects of ` microscopic ' ( individual ) interactions . *",
    "the probability of occurence of each strategy can be calculated .",
    "this is especially important for small social systems which are subject to large fluctuations ( since they consist of a few individuals only ) . *",
    "the stochastic model allows the derivation of _ covariance equations _",
    "section  [ mostexp ] ) .",
    "since the covariances influence the average temporal behavior , they are an essential criterium for the validity and reliability of behavioral descriptions by rate equations ( which are actually approximate mean value equations ) .",
    "if the covariances exceed a certain critical value , this indicates the occurence of a _ phase transition _ ,",
    "i.e. a sudden change of the properties of the considered social system .    for the description of systems that are subject to random fluctuations different stochastic methods",
    "have been developed ( cf .",
    "e.g. gardiner , 1983 ; weidlich and haag , 1983 ; helbing , 1992 ) .",
    "one method is to delineate the temporal evolution of the _ probability distribution _ over the different possible states ( which represent behavioral strategies , here ) .",
    "this method is particularly suitable for an _",
    "` ensemble ' _ of similar systems or for frequently occuring processes . in the case of",
    "_ discrete _ states , the _ master equation _ has to be used , whereas in the case of _ continuous _ state variables the fokker - planck _ equation _ is normally preferred since it is easier to handle ( fokker , 1914 ; planck , 1917 ) .",
    "the fokker - planck equation can , in good approximation , also be applied to systems with a large number of discrete states if state changes only occur between neighbouring states .",
    "it can be derived from the master equation by a kramers - moyal _ expansion _ ( kramers , 1940 ; moyal , 1949 ) , i.e. a second order taylor _ approximation _ , then .",
    "another method , the langevin _ equation _ ( 1908 ) ( or _ stochastic differential equation _ ) is applied to the description of the temporal evolution of _ single _ fluctuation - affected systems .",
    "it consists of a deterministic dynamical part which delineates systematic state changes and a stochastic fluctuation term which reflects random state variations .",
    "the langevin equation can be reformulated in terms of a fokker - planck equation and vice versa ( if the fluctuations are gaussian and @xmath0-correlated which is normally the case ; cf .",
    "stratonovich , 1963 , 1967 ; weidlich and haag , 1983 ) .",
    "although these methods come from statistical physics , the application to _ interdisciplinary _ topics has meanwhile a long and successful tradition , beginning with the work of weidlich ( 1971 , 1972 ) , haken ( 1975 ) , prigogine ( 1976 ) , nicolis and prigogine ( 1977 ) . also for social and economic processes fokker - planck equation models ( cf .",
    "e.g. weidlich and haag , 1983 ; topol , 1991 ) as well as master equation models ( cf .",
    "e.g. weidlich and haag , 1983 ; weidlich , 1991 ; haag et.al . , 1993 ; weidlich and braun , 1992 ) were proposed . in this paper",
    "we will develop a behavioral model on the basis of the master equation ( section [ stoch ] ) .",
    "for this purpose we have to specify the _ transition rates _ ,",
    "i.e. the _ probabilities _ per time unit with which changes of behavioral strategies take place .",
    "the transition rates can be decomposed into    * rates describing _ spontaneous _ strategy changes , and * rates describing strategy changes due to _ pair interactions _ of individuals .    in the following",
    "we will restrict our considerations to _ imitative _ pair interactions which seem to be the most important ones ( helbing , 1994 ) . by distinguishing several _ subpopulations _",
    "@xmath1 , different _ types _ of behavior or different _ groups _ of individuals can be taken into account .    in order to connect the stochastic behavioral model to the game dynamical equations the transition rates have to be chosen in such a way that they depend on the _ expected successes _ of the behavioral strategies ( cf .",
    "section [ micfound ] ) .",
    "the ordinary game dynamical equations are the _ approximate mean value",
    "_ equations of the stochastic behavioral model ( cf . section [ deriv ] ) .    for the approximate mean",

    "these depend on the covariances ( of the numbers of individuals pursuing a certain strategy ) ( cf .",
    "section [ corr ] ) . neglecting these corrections",
    ", the game dynamical equations may lose their validity after some time .",
    "the calculation of the covariances allows the determination of the time interval during which game dynamical descriptions are reliable ( cf .",
    "section [ compres ] ) .",
    "the introduced equations are illustrated by computational results for the self - organization of a behavioral convention by a competition between two alternative , but equivalent strategies ( cf . sections [ selfor ] and [ mostexp ] ) .",
    "these results are relevant for economics with respect to the rivalry between similar products ( arthur , 1988 , 1989 ; hauk , 1994 ) .",

    "the problem of this section is to specify the frequency @xmath52 and the readiness @xmath54 in an adequate way . for this",
    "we make the following assumptions :    * by experience each individual knows  at least approximately  the _ expected success _ of the strategy used : we will define the expected success of a strategy @xmath9 for an individual of subpopulation @xmath1 in interactions with other individuals by @xmath55 here , the parameter @xmath56 represents the _ relative contact rate _ of an individual of subpopulation @xmath1 with individuals of subpopulation @xmath28 .",

    "@xmath58 is an exogenously given quantity that denotes the _ success _ of strategy @xmath9 for an individual of subpopulation @xmath1 during an interaction with an individual of subpopulation @xmath28 who uses strategy @xmath29 .",
    "since all these quantities can be determined by each individual , the evaluation of the expected success @xmath59 is obviously possible . * in interactions with individuals of the _ same _ subpopulation an individual tends to take over the strategy of another individual if the expected success would increase : when an individual who uses strategy @xmath9 meets another individual of the same subpopulation who uses strategy @xmath29 , they compare their expected successes @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively by exchange of their experiences .",
    "( remember that individuals of the same subpopulation were assumed to cooperate . )",
    "the individual with strategy @xmath9 will _ imitate _ the other s strategy @xmath29 with a probability @xmath48 that is growing with the expected increase @xmath61 of success .",
    "if a change of strategy would imply a _ decrease _ of success ( @xmath62 ) , the individual will not change the strategy @xmath9 .",

    "this describes an individual _ optimization _ or _ learning process_. * in interactions with individuals of _ other _ subpopulations ( who behave in a non - cooperative way ) normally no imitative processes will take place : during these interactions the expected success @xmath67 of the interaction partner can at best be _ estimated _ by _ observation _ since he will not tell his experiences .",
    "moreover , due to different criteria for the grade of success , the expected success of a strategy @xmath29 will normally be varying with the subpopulation ( i.e. @xmath68 for ) . as a consequence , an imitation of the strategy of individuals belonging to _ another _ subpopulation would be very risky since it would probably be connected with a _ decrease _ of expected success . hence the assumption @xmath69 will normally be justified .",
    "+ relation ( [ fab ] ) also results in cases where the strategies of the respective other subpopulations _ can not _",
    "be imitated due to different ( disjunct ) strategy sets .",
    "then , we need not to assume that individuals of the same subpopulations cooperate , whereas individuals of different subpopulations do not .    in section [ dyngame ]",
    "it will turn out that the game dynamical equations are the approximate mean value equations of the stochastic behavioral model defined by ( [ specform ] ) to ( [ fab ] ) . in this sense",
    ", the model of this section can be regarded as stochastic version of the game dynamical equations . moreover , the assumptions made above are a ` microscopic ' foundation of evolutionary game theory since they allow a derivation of the game dynamical equations on the basis of individual behavior patterns .      as an example for",
    "the stochastic game dynamical equations we will consider a case with one subpopulation only ( @xmath70 ) . in this case we can omit the indices @xmath1 , @xmath28 , and the summation over @xmath28 . let us assume the individuals to choose between two _ equivalent _ strategies @xmath71 , i.e. the _ success matrix _ @xmath72 is symmetrical:@xmath73 according to the relation @xmath74 ( cf .",
    "( [ sum ] ) ) , @xmath75 is already determined by @xmath76 . for spontaneous strategy changes due to _ trial and error _ we will take the simplest form of transition rates : @xmath77 a situation of the above kind is the avoidance behavior of pedestrians ( cf .",
    "helbing , 1991 , 1992 ) : in pedestrian crowds with two opposite directions of motion , pedestrians have sometimes to avoid each other in order to exclude a collision .",
    "for an avoidance maneuver to be successful , both pedestrians concerned have to pass the respective other pedestrian either on the right hand side ( strategy @xmath78 ) or on the left hand side ( strategy @xmath79 ) . otherwise , both pedestrians have to stop ( cf .",
    "figure [ separation]a ) . here ,",
    "both strategies are equivalent , but the success of a strategy increases with the number @xmath80 of individuals who use the _ same _ strategy . in success matrix ( [ pay ] ) we have @xmath81 then .    empirically one finds that the probability @xmath82 of choosing the right hand side is usually different from the probability @xmath83 of choosing the left hand side . consequently",
    ", opposite directions of motion normally use separate lanes ( cf .",
    "figure  [ separation]b ) .",
    "we will now examine if our behavioral model can explain this _",
    "symmetry breaking _ ( the fact that @xmath84 ) . figure  [ phasetr ] shows some computational results for @xmath85 and different values of @xmath86 . if @xmath87 the configurational distribution is unimodal and symmetrical with respect to @xmath88 , i.e. both strategies will be chosen by about one half of the individuals . at the _ critical point _",
    "@xmath89 there appears a _ phase transition ( bifurcation)_. this is indicated by the broadness of the probability distribution @xmath90 which comes from socalled _ critical fluctuations _",
    "haken , 1983 ) .",
    "the term ` critical fluctuations ' denotes the fact that the fluctuations become particularly large at a critical point since the system behavior is unstable , then . whereas the individuals behave more or less independently _ before _ the phase transition ( @xmath91 ) , around the critical point the individuals begin to act correlated due to their ( imitative ) interactions .",
    "however , the spontaneous strategy changes ( represented by @xmath92 ) still prevent the formation of a behavioral preference . above the critical point (",
    "i.e. for @xmath93 ) the correlation of individual behaviors is strong enough for the _ self - organization ( emergence ) of a behavioral convention : _ the configurational distribution becomes multimodal in the course of time with maxima at @xmath94 so that one of the two equivalent strategies will very probably be chosen by a _ majority _ of individuals . in this connection one",
    "also speaks of _ symmetry breaking _ ( haken , 1979 , 1983 ) .",
    "behavioral conventions often obtain a law - like character after some time . which one of two equivalent strategies will win the majority is completely random .",
    "it is possible , that conventions differ from one region to another .",
    "this is , for example , the case for the prescribed driving direction of cars .    the model of this section",
    "can also be applied to the competition between the two video systems vhs and beta max which were equivalent with respect to technology and price at the beginning ( hauk , 1994 ) .",
    "in the course of time vhs won this rivalry since ( for reasons of _ compatibility _ concerning copying , selling or hiring of video tapes ) it was advantageous for new purchasers to decide for that video system which gained a small majority at some moment .",
    "other examples for the emergence of a behavioral convention are the revolution direction of clock hands , the direction of writing , etc .",
    "a generalization of the above model to the case of more than two alternative strategies is easily possible .",
    "of course , the model can also be adapted to situations where one behavioral alternative is superior to the others . however , the formation of a behavioral convention is trivial , then .",
    "finally , some related models should be mentioned which were proposed during the recent years for the description of symmetry breaking phenomena in economics : orlan ( 1992 , 1993 ) and orlan and robin ( 1992 ) presented a phase transition model using polynomial transition rates which base on a bayesian rationale .",
    "durlauf ( 1989 , 1991 ) used markovian fields to explain the non - ergodic ( i.e. path - dependent ) behavior of some economic systems .",
    "fllmer ( 1974 ) applied the ising model paradigm ( 1925 ) to model an economy of many interacting agents and discussed under which conditions a symmetry breakdown occurs . a similar model for polarization effects in opinion formation",
    "was already suggested by weidlich ( 1972 ) .",
    "last but not least topol ( 1991 ) presented a fokker - planck equation model for the explanation of bubbles in stock markets by mimetic contagion ( i.e. some kind of imitative interactions ) between agents .",

    "approach ( [ newan ] ) originally stems from physics where the exponential function for the transition probability is due to the need to obtain the boltzmann distribution ( 1964 ) as stationary distribution .",

    "a quite general model for changes of behavioral strategies has been developed which takes into account spontaneous changes and changes due to pair interactions .",
    "three kinds of pair interactions can be distinguished : imitative , avoidance and compromising processes .",
    "the game dynamical equations result for a special case of imitative processes .",
    "they can be interpreted as equations for the most probable strategy distribution or as approximate mean value equations of a stochastic version of evolutionary game theory . in order to calculate correction terms for the game dynamical equations as well as to determine the reliability or the time period of validity of game dynamical descriptions , one has to evaluate the corresponding covariance equations .",
    "therefore , covariance equations have been derived for a very general class of master equations .",
    "the model can be extended in a way that takes into account the expectations about the future temporal evolution of the expected successes @xmath155 ( the _ ` shadow of the future ' _ ) . for this purpose , in ( [ game ] ) @xmath155 must be replaced by a quantity @xmath186 which represents the expectations about the future success of strategy @xmath9 on the basis of its success @xmath187 at past times @xmath188 .",
