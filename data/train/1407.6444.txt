    "the fixed points enjoy the infinite - dimensional conformal symmetry which is a powerful tool in solving them @xcite . besides the traditional objects of interest  local operators and their correlation functions  boundary conditions and conformal defects ( interfaces between 2d cfts ) have received much attention .",
    "such objects are not only interesting in their own right , but have proved to be an important tool in classifying and solving cfts ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite an interesting idea was put forward which associates a defect between uv and ir fixed points , described by @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , with a renormalization group flow connecting them . if the flow is triggered by a perturbation @xmath9 of the uv fixed point , one can consider this perturbation and the subsequent rg flow on a half plane @xmath10 .",

    "renormalization will then require the introduction of new boundary couplings , which will flow together with the bulk couplings @xmath14 .",
    "we can fold the bulk theory along the @xmath13 line and look at the resulting flow on a half plane @xmath15 as a coupled bulk plus boundary flow ( such a folding trick @xcite is customary in defect theory ) . on the interior of a half plane",
    "the bulk flow connects the tensor product of two copies of the uv theory @xmath16 to @xmath17 , while the induced boundary flow connects the trivial conformal boundary condition in @xmath16 to some conformal boundary condition in @xmath17 .",

    "we will often omit the word  conformal \" .",
    "the idea that one has a conformal object , which can be handled using the powerful algebraic techniques of cfts , that carries information about an rg flow is very appealing .",
    "the important question seems to be  exactly what information do perturbation defects carry about the bulk flows ?    given a conformal boundary condition @xmath20 in @xmath18 , a bulk flow will typically induce some boundary rg flow that will bring @xmath21 to some conformal boundary condition @xmath22 in @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that @xmath22 can be obtained by fusing the perturbation defect associated with the bulk flow with @xmath20 .",
    "concrete rg flows between supersymmetric @xmath23 minimal models were studied in @xcite and the proposed fusion rule was shown to hold .    in @xcite the general idea of associating a conformal defect to bulk rg flows was approached from a different angle .",
    "any conformal defect between @xmath18 and @xmath8 gives a pairing of local operators in the two theories .",

    "the coefficients @xmath26 essentially can be computed from the rg mixing matrices driven to the ir fixed point .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that special conformal defects ( rg domain walls ) exist for which the natural pairing between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is equal to the rg coefficients @xmath26 . for",
    "the rg flows between two neighbouring minimal models described in @xcite a candidate defect which is conjectured to have this property was constructed in @xcite .",
    "we discuss this defect in some more detail in sections [ g_defect ] and [ conclusion ] .",
    "here we would like to note that it is not clear whether such a defect is unique in view of the scheme dependence of the coefficients @xmath26 .",
    "it is also not clear what the relation between the rg domain walls of @xcite and the perturbation defects of @xcite is in general .    in this paper",
    "we consider perturbation defects , associated to ",
    "short \" rg flows in the bulk .",
    "such a flow is triggered by perturbing the uv cft by a nearly marginal operator @xmath29 with scaling dimension @xmath30 , where @xmath31 can be used as a dimensionless perturbation parameter .",
    "we assume that the ope of @xmath29 with itself , [ ope ] ( x ) ( 0 ) = + ( 0 ) + , does not contain any other relevant operators besides the identity and @xmath29 itself .",
    "if @xmath32 is the renormalised coupling constant corresponding to the @xmath29-perturbation , the beta function at quadratic order can be written as ( ) = + c ^2 .",
    "the new fixed point is located at @xmath33 which is small if @xmath31 and the scheme - dependent coefficient @xmath34 is fixed . in practical applications , such as flows between neighbouring minimal models @xmath0 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath34",
    "both depend on a small parameter like @xmath1 .",
    "we can trade this parameter for @xmath37 and thus @xmath38 .",
    "in such cases , one obtains a small @xmath39 if the limiting value of @xmath34 is non - vanishing in the @xmath40 limit . in practice",
    "we can always choose a scheme , which we will call wilsonian , in which @xmath41 and this assumption is easy to check .",
    "thus if we perturb the system in the right direction we will flow to an infrared fixed point at @xmath42 which is nearby in the coupling space .. ]    we consider the perturbation defect associated to such a flow . since @xmath29 has dimension close to two , the only relevant perturbation from the boundary point of view is the identity field .",
    "thus , after the introduction of the bulk counter terms , only additional linear divergences can be present along the position of the defect . to get the conformal defect we therefore only need to subtract these additional linear divergences and arrive at the bulk fixed point @xmath39 .",
    "we calculate the @xmath43-factor of affleck and ludwig @xcite for the conformal perturbation defect at the leading and the next - to - leading orders .",
    "our main result can be formulated as follows . in the wilsonian rg scheme the beta function up to cubic order",
    "has the form ( ) = + c ^2 + ^2 d ^3 , where the coefficient @xmath44 is universal ( scheme - independent ) up to terms of the order @xmath45 .",
    "we find that the square of the perturbation defect @xmath43-factor equals [ main_result ] g^2_= 1 + + + o(^4 ) .",
    "this formula is our main result .",
    "it is a universal formula of the type derived in @xcite , @xcite for the change of the central charge along the short flows .",
    "another formula of similar type was derived in @xcite for the change of the @xmath43-factor along short boundary flows .    the leading order correction in , [ g_leading ] g^2_= 1 + + o(^3 ) , is given by ( the limiting value of ) the ope coefficient @xmath46 in ( [ ope ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in a unitary theory the leading order correction is always positive , unlike in pure boundary flows @xcite .",
    "as is well known to condensed matter theorists the @xmath43-theorem of @xcite can be violated in the bulk plus boundary rg flows ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .    specialising formula ( [ main_result ] ) to the flows between the neighbouring minimal models @xcite we checked it against the @xmath43-factor of the rg domain wall candidate constructed in @xcite and found the exact match in the leading and next - to - leading orders in the expansion parameter .",
    "this corroborates that the defect of @xcite is the perturbation defect for @xmath47 flows in the minimal models .",
    "we hope that the perturbation defect picture will be more suggestive in understanding the relationship with the rg coefficients @xmath26 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section [ g ]",

    "we conclude in section [ conclusion ] with some remarks .",
    "all hard computational details are moved to the appendices .",
    "we consider the perturbation defect as a boundary condition in a tensor product of the undeformed @xmath18 and the deformed theory which we will drive to the ir fixed point . in order to calculate the boundary entropy we follow @xcite and put this boundary condition on a cylinder of length @xmath48 and circumference @xmath49 . from the cylinder partition function",
    "we can extract the boundary partition function as the finite piece in the @xmath50 limit . at the ir fixed point the value of the boundary partition function",
    "gives the @xmath43-factor , and the boundary entropy is simply @xmath51 . if we unfold the defect , the cylinder becomes a torus in which half of the torus is perturbed .",
    "we can set up a perturbative expansion for the free energy of such a torus as [ torus_pert ] = e^s _ uv , s = ^- _ t_1/2 d^2 w ( w ) , where we introduced a dimensionless coupling @xmath32 , @xmath52 is a renormalization length scale , @xmath53 stands for the perturbed half torus , and @xmath54 denotes the connected correlators evaluated in @xmath18 on the torus . for generic small value of @xmath37 all uv divergences in this perturbation series are power - like divergences which we can unambiguously subtract , _",
    "e.g. _ using analytic continuation in @xmath37 .",
    "as we take the limit @xmath50 the torus becomes very long and the leading contribution must come from a cylinder partition function with the ends capped by the vacuum of the uv theory @xmath55 ( see the picture below ) .",

    "we are going to use the integrals @xmath74 and @xmath75 to calculate the first two terms in the @xmath37-expansion of @xmath76 .",
    "this quantity is in some sense a natural companion of the central charge shift .",
    "we note that the finite temperature correlation functions at hand decay exponentially at @xmath50 , so that there can be no extra contributions from the @xmath69 integrals to the finite @xmath76 piece . in the next section",
    "we discuss in detail the renormalization scheme ( in)dependence of the calculation .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , for generic @xmath77 we only have power divergences , which can be subtracted by analytic continuation in @xmath37 . however , at @xmath78 the coupling becomes marginal and we get logarithmic divergences . for finite @xmath37",
    "they show up as poles in renormalised quantities at @xmath79 . to obtain a small @xmath37 expansion of any physical quantity we must subtract these poles .",
    "this defines a good coordinate near the ir fixed point .",

    "the cubic term @xmath75 contains a pole @xmath95 coming from two @xmath29-insertions colliding away from the boundary .",
    "this pole is to be subtracted by the same bulk counterterm used to renormalise the bulk theory . by naive power counting",
    "there can be no extra poles from collisions at the boundary of the integration region .",
    "analyzing @xmath75 in section [ cubic ] , we will check this as well as the correct factorisation of @xmath75 at the pole explicitly .",
    "it is convenient to absorb the factors of s^= ( ) ^ into a rescaled coupling constant s^ . to the order @xmath88 such a rescaling only shifts the @xmath96 coefficient in the beta function .",
    "after the rescaling we have [ g_22 ] g_^2 = 1 + ^2 i_2^ren ( ) + ^3 i_3^ren ( ) +  .",

    "we see that the only scheme dependent terms in this expression are @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "it is easy to see from the definition ( [ gn ] ) that the change in the bulk 1-loop counterterm ( [ ct_shift ] ) will result in the shift i_3^(0 ) i_3 - 2f(0 ) i_2^(0 ) .",
    "taking into account ( [ c1_shift ] ) we therefore observe that the combination i_3^(0 ) + 2c_1 i_2^(0 ) is scheme independent , and so is the expansion ( [ g2_detailed ] ) .",
    "the scheme independence means we can use any convenient scheme to calculate @xmath98 , @xmath99 . in the following",

    "we obtain the leading order formula ( [ g_leading ] ) .",
    "it is also easy to obtain the value of @xmath108 from directly working at @xmath79 with a position - space cutoff .",
    "the integral has a linear divergence coming from the region near the boundary of the infinite half - cylinder ( or the disc ) .",
    "in the cubic order we are dealing with a double integral over an infinite half cylinder g_3 = -c()^3 _ 0_1 _ 2 d^2_1 d^2_2 ( re _ 2 ) g(_1,_2 ) , where g(_1,_2)=| ( ) ( ) ( ) |^- . using the variables _ 1 = e^- , _ 2 = e^-(_2 - _ 1 ) we obtain g_3 = ( ) ^3 i_3 ( ) , i_3 ( ) = c i_3 ( ) with [ i3_disc ] i_3 ( ) = 4_|_1|1 , |_2|1 d^2_1d^2_2 .",

    "~2c_0 i_2^(0 ) +  , and therefore it is indeed subtracted by the bulk counterterm ( [ tct ] ) .",
    "this proves that , as expected by power counting , no additional renormalization is needed for @xmath89 apart from the analytic continuation that gets rid of linear divergences . in the wilsonian minimal scheme ( described at the end of section [ ren ] ) we subtract @xmath111 at the pole . using ( [ i2 ] )",
