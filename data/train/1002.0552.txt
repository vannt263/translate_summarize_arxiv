    "our aim is to systematically study , apart from the single stationary dark soliton ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a study in the tf-1d regime ) , multiple dark soliton states as well ; such a study is particularly relevant , as many dark solitons can be experimentally created by means of the matter - wave interference method , as demonstrated in refs .",
    "our study starts from the non - interacting ( linear ) limit , where we obtain the pertinent excited states of the bec and , then , using continuation in the chemical potential ( number of atoms ) , we find all branches of purely nonlinear solutions , including the ground state and single or multiple dark solitons , and their bifurcations .",
    "an important finding of our analysis is that the optical lattice ( which sets the barrier in the double - well setting ) results in the emergence of nonlinear states that do not have a linear counterpart , such as dark soliton states , with solitons located in one well of the double - well potential .",
    "as concerns the bifurcations of the various branches of solutions , we show that particular states emerge or disappear for certain chemical potential thresholds , which are determined analytically , in some cases , by using a galerkin - type approach @xcite . for each branch , we also study the stability of the pertinent solutions via a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) analysis , which reveals the role of the anomalous ( negative energy ) modes in the excitation spectra as concerns the emergence of oscillatory instabilities of dark solitons : it is found that such instabilities occur due to the collision of an anomalous mode with a positive energy mode .",
    "furthermore , based on the weakly - interacting limit of the model , we study analytically small - amplitude oscillations of the one- and multiple - dark - soliton states . particularly , we obtain equations of motion for the single and multiple solitons from which we determine the characteristic soliton frequencies ; the latter , are found to be , in many cases in good agreement with the eigenfrequencies found in the framework of the bdg analysis .",

    "( [ bdg1])-([bdg2 ] ) , we determine the eigenfrequencies @xmath37 and the amplitudes @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the normal modes of the system .",
    "note that if @xmath40 is an eigenfrequency of the bogoliubov spectrum , so are @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( due to the hamiltonian nature of the system ) , and consequently the occurrence of a complex eigenfrequency always leads to a dynamic instability .",
    "thus , a linearly stable configuration is tantamount to @xmath44 , i.e. , all eigenfrequencies being real . an important quantity resulting from the bdg analysis is the amount of energy carried by the normal mode with eigenfrequency @xmath40 , namely @xmath45 the sign of this quantity , known as _ krein sign _ @xcite , is a topological property of each eigenmode . importantly ,",
    "if the normal mode eigenfrequencies with opposite energy ( krein ) signs become resonant then , in most cases , there appear complex frequencies in the excitation spectrum , i.e. , a dynamical instability occurs @xcite . in order to further elaborate on such a possibility , it is relevant to note that modes with complex or imaginary frequencies carry zero energy ( due to the condition @xmath46 , which must hold for each bdg mode ) , while _ anomalous modes _ have negative energy ( see , e.g. , sec .",

    "( [ 1ddelgado ] ) is reduced to a linear schrdinger equation for a confined single - particle state , namely the equation of the quantum harmonic oscillator , together with the contribution of the optical lattice .",

    "( [ 1ddelgado ] ) without a linear counterpart , at least in the case of a purely harmonic potential .",
    "however , as we will show below , the presence of the optical lattice in the model results in the occurrence of additional states , for sufficiently large nonlinearity ( large atom numbers ) , which do not have a linear counterpart .",

    "first , for the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eqofm ] ) , it was assumed that the background density of the condensate can be described via the tf approximation ; this actually means that eq .",
    "( [ eqofm ] ) is valid only for sufficiently large number of atoms . at the same time , however , the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eqofm ] ) was done in the framework of the cubic nls model , i.e. , the weakly - interacting limit of eq .",
    "( [ 1ddelgado ] ) , which is valid for sufficiently small number of atoms .",
    "nevertheless , eq .",
    "( [ eqofm ] ) may still be relevant to provide some estimates .",
    "it is known that the soliton oscillation frequency ( for a bec confined in a harmonic trap ) is up - shifted for large number of atoms due to the dimensionality of the system ( i.e. , the effect of transverse dimensions , which are taken into regard in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ 1ddelgado ] ) ) @xcite .",
    "particularly , one should expect that in the case of a purely harmonic trap the soliton oscillates with a frequency @xmath74 , which can be found numerically in the absence of the optical lattice ( note that @xmath75 is the characteristic value of the soliton oscillation frequency in a 1d harmonic trap of strength @xmath76 in the tf limit  @xcite ) .",
    "for a more detailed discussion see sec .  [ sec 4a ] .",
    "moreover , for sufficiently small optical lattice wavenumbers ( such as the chosen value of @xmath77 ) , and large chemical potentials ( tf limit ) the effective potential of eq.([veff ] ) can be simplified to the following form : @xmath78    we complete this section by mentioning that the case of two ( or more ) spatially well separated solitons can also be treated analytically , taking into account the repulsive interaction potential between two solitons . in the case of two spatially separated solitons located at @xmath79 and @xmath80 , on top of a constant background with density @xmath67",

    "let us now proceed by investigating the existence , the stability and possible bifurcations of the lowest macroscopically excited states of eq .",
    "( [ 1ddelgado ] ) .",
    "we fix the parameter values as follows : @xmath82 , @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath18 ev ; for such a choice , the four lowest eigenvalues of the operator @xmath83 ( corresponding to the linear problem ) are found to be : @xmath84 and the energy of the first excited state is almost degenerate with that of the ground state , i.e. , @xmath85 .",

    "branch ( 1 ) corresponds to the states with the largest number of atoms , for fixed chemical potential .",
    "the respective states are symmetric and have no nodes . continuation of this symmetric branch to the linear limit ends at the eigenvalue @xmath90 , corresponding to the ground state of the linear problem .",
    "the second branch [ branch ( 2 ) ] starts from the first excited state in the linear limit , @xmath91 as @xmath65 .",
    "the wavefunctions of the states of this branch are _ antisymmetric _ and have a node at the center of the barrier , while their densities are symmetric . from this density symmetric one - soliton branch , two asymmetric one - soliton branches , namely branch ( 3 ) and its mirror image with respect to the @xmath92 axis , bifurcate close to the linear limit , at @xmath93  ev",
    " see the close - up inset .",
    "let us define a local occupation number , i.e. , number of atoms in the different wells , as the integral over the density up to the center of the barrier ( see also sec .",
    "v below ) .",
    "the occupation number in the well with the node is then smaller than the occupation number without the node .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the state with one node is the first excited state , characterized by a higher energy than the one without a node , which is the ground state .",
    "thus , in order to balance the chemical potential in both wells one needs a larger interaction energy ( i.e. , more atoms ) in the well without a node .",
    "note that the macroscopic quantum self - trapping ( mqst ) state as predicted in ref @xcite is not considered in what follows .",
    "the reason for that is that the mqst is a running phase state while our bifurcation analysis below focuses on the stationary states of the system .",

    "the other state has both nodes in one well .",
    "once again , the occupation number in the well with two nodes is less than the one of the well with one node , so as to balance the chemical potential .",
    "branch ( 6 ) starts from the second excited state of the linear problem , hence @xmath95 as @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the density of the respective state is symmetric and there is one node in each well .",
    "branch ( 7 ) starts from the third excited state of the linear problem , and @xmath97 as @xmath96 .",

    "specifically , the mode with smaller amplitude performs an in - phase oscillation ( with the two solitons moving towards the same direction ) , whereas the mode with larger amplitude performs an out - of - phase oscillation ( with the two solitons moving towards opposite directions ) with a larger oscillation frequency .",
    "the existence of two different oscillation frequencies indicates the coupling of the dark solitons .",
    "this situation changes for a large optical lattice strength ( e.g. , @xmath194 ev ) : in this case , the two dark solitons are decoupled , since the numerical simulations show that both the in - phase and out - of phase oscillations are characterized by almost the same frequency .    , but for the symmetric two - soliton state with in - phase ( left ) anomalous mode and out - of - phase ( right ) imaginary mode perturbations , for @xmath195 ev and @xmath190 ev . the former anomalous eigenmode is stable , while the latter is unstable ( as concluded also from the bdg analysis).,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ] , but for the symmetric two - soliton state with in - phase ( left ) anomalous mode and out - of - phase ( right ) imaginary mode perturbations , for @xmath195 ev and @xmath190 ev . the former anomalous eigenmode is stable , while the latter is unstable ( as concluded also from the bdg analysis).,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : 12 ] shows the time evolution of the symmetric two - soliton state for @xmath195 ev and @xmath190  ev perturbed by the eigenvector corresponding to the anomalous mode associated with in - phase ( left panel ) and by the eigenvector corresponding to the imaginary mode out - of - phase ( right panel ) oscillations of the dark solitons . for these parameters ,",
    "the bdg analysis predicts that the former mode is stable while the latter is unstable .",
    "this is confirmed by the direct simulations : it is clearly observed that the amplitude of the out - of - phase oscillation increases whereas the amplitude of the in - phase oscillation remains constant .    , but for the symmetric two - soliton state , for @xmath196 ev and @xmath190 ev . notice the reversal of stability of the two anomalous modes with respect to fig .",
    "[ fig : 12].,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ] , but for the symmetric two - soliton state , for @xmath196 ev and @xmath190 ev .",

    "[ fig : 12].,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : 13 ] we show the time evolution of the symmetric two soliton state for @xmath196 ev and @xmath190 perturbed by the eigenvector corresponding to the anomalous mode with in - phase ( left panel ) and by the eigenvector corresponding to the imaginary mode out - of - phase ( right panel ) oscillations . for these parameters ,",
    "the simulations show that the out - of - phase oscillation of the solitons is stable and the in - phase oscillation unstable , in agreement with the predictions of the bdg analysis .",
    "in this work , we have performed a detailed study of the statics and dynamics of matter - wave dark solitons in a cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) confined in a double - well potential .",
    "the latter , was assumed to be formed as a combination of a usual harmonic trap and a periodic ( optical lattice ) potential . for our analysis ,",
    "we have adopted and used an effectively 1d mean - field model , namely a gross - pitaevskii ( gp)-like equation with a non - cubic nonlinearity , which has been used successfully in other works to describe dark solitons in becs in the dimensionality crossover regime between 1d and 3d .    as a first step in our analysis , we studied the existence and stability of both the one- and multiple - dark soliton states .",
    "in particular , starting from the respective linear problem , we have used the continuation with respect to the chemical potential ( number of atoms ) to reveal the different branches of purely nonlinear solutions , including the ground state , as well as excited states , in the form of single or multiple dark solitons .",
    "we have shown that the presence of the optical lattice is crucial for the existence of nonlinear states that do not have a linear counterpart : these are actually asymmetric dark soliton states , with solitons located in one well ( rather than in both wells ) of the double - well potential , and do not exist in the non - interacting  linear  limit .",
    "we have systematically studied the bifurcations of the various branches of solutions and showed how each particular state emerges or disappears for certain chemical potential thresholds ; the latter were determined analytically , in some cases , by using a galerkin - type approach , in very good agreement with the numerical results . for each branch , we have also studied the stability of the pertinent solutions via a bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) analysis . this way , we have discussed the role of the anomalous ( negative energy ) modes in the excitation spectra and revealed two types of instabilities of dark solitons , corresponding to either purely imaginary or genuinely complex eigenfrequencies ; the latter were found to occur due to the collision of an anomalous mode with a positive energy mode and are associated with the so - called oscillatory instabilities of dark solitons .",
    "we have also adopted a simple analytical model to study small - amplitude oscillations of the one- and multiple - dark - soliton states .",
    "particularly , equations of motion for the single and multiple solitons were presented in the weakly - interacting limit ( where the model becomes the usual cubic 1d gp equation ) , and modified them to take into regard the dimensionality of the system ( i.e. , the effect of transverse directions ) .",
    "the analysis of these equations of motion led to the determination of the characteristic soliton frequencies , which were then compared to the eigenfrequencies found in the framework of the bdg analysis ; the agreement between the two was generally found to be very good .",
    "perhaps even more importantly , the simple physical ( i.e. , particle ) picture we adopted allowed us to reveal the role of the optical lattice strength ( i.e. , the height of the barrier in the double - well setting ) in the stability of the dark solitons , as well as its role on the coupling between solitons .",
    "particularly , it was found that sufficiently strong barriers lead to instability of symmetric and asymmetric soliton states , while it results in an effective decoupling of multi - solitons : the coupling between neighboring solitons as described by an effective repulsive potential , becomes negligible for sufficiently strong barriers .",
    "we should also note that generally the states possessing a dark soliton at the center of the trap were found to be most strongly unstable , due to the emergence of a progressively larger ( the larger the nonlinearity ) imaginary eigenfrequency .",
    "finally , we have performed systematic numerical simulations , based on direct numerical integration of the quasi - one - dimensional model , to investigate the dynamics of dark solitons in the double - well setup .",
    "we studied the manifestation of instabilities , when present , and found in all cases , a very good agreement between the predictions based on the bdg analysis and the numerical results .",
    "instabilities have been observed to manifest themselves through the exponential divergence of the soliton from its initial location ( when associated with an imaginary pair of eigenfrequencies ) or the oscillatory growth ( when associated with a complex quartet of eigenfrequencies ) .    an interesting direction for a future study would be a similar analysis in a higher - dimensional setting : this would refer to vortices confined in double - well potentials ( or more complex `` energy surfaces '' such as quadruple - well potentials @xcite ) in higher - dimensional becs .",
    "such studies are presently in progress .",
