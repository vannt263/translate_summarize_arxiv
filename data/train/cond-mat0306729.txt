    "while the physics of electron systems on flat two - dimensional planes ( `` 2degs '' ) has been firmly established , it should be interesting to consider what will happen when we put electrons on _ curved surfaces_. here we consider electrons bound on periodic curved surfaces , envisaged as the `` crystal composed of surfaces''@xcite .",
    "geometrically , we can construct periodic curved surfaces that extend over the entire three - dimensional space by connecting hyperbolic ( i.e. , everywhere negatively curved ) patches .",
    "specifically , schwarz has constructed _ periodic minimal surfaces _",
    ", where minimal means that the negatively - curved surface has a minimized area@xcite .    in the materials - science viewpoint",
    "we can envisage that periodic minimal surfaces represent the topology of a class of condensed - matter systems , where atoms are arrayed along a curved surface .",
    "when the atomic sheet is graphitic , this corresponds to the carbon structure called c@xmath0 zeolite or negative - curvature fullerene@xcite , which are periodic surfaces if we smear out atoms in the effective - mass sense .",
    "it is then a fundamental question to consider how mobile ( e.g. , @xmath1 ) electrons behave .    in this paper",
    ", we first formulate schrdinger s equation for free electrons on periodic surfaces , which turns out to be neatly expressed with weierstrass s representation when the surface is minimal .",
    "we then numerically calculate the band structure for a typical periodic minimal surface , schwarz s p - surface ( @xmath2 c@xmath0 zeolite ; see fig.[fig : surfaceunit ] ) .",
    "one interest is the relative importance of the effects of the global topology of the surface against the local atomic configuration .",
    "so we move on to a comparison of the band structure for a periodic continuous surface with that for an atomic network with a similar topology .",
    "we have found that their low - energy electronic structures are similar , i.e. , primarily determined by how the wavefunction interferes on a multiply - connected surface .",
    "we start with a differential - geometric prerequisite for representing minimal surfaces .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional surface @xmath3 embedded in 3d as parametrised by two coordinates @xmath4 . according to weierstrass and enneper ,",
    "when @xmath5 is a minimal surface , there exist @xmath6 , functions of @xmath7 , with which @xmath8 is expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is assumed to be regular : if not , we can exclude these points by incising cut(s ) to make @xmath11 a riemann surface .    to construct schrdinger s equation for an electron on a curved surface , we adopt a physcial approach where we consider electrons bound to a thin , curved slab of thickness @xmath12 , where the limit @xmath13 is taken@xcite .",
    "with two - dimensional coordinates @xmath14 and metric tensor @xmath15 , the equation reads @xmath16 \\psi(q^1 , q^2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{45 mm } = e\\ \\psi(q^1 , q^2 ) ,        \\label{eqn : schresult2 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where summations over repeated indices are assumed , and @xmath17 are the local principal curvatures .",
    "an effect of the curvature appears as a curvature potential , @xmath18 , which is in general nonzero even when the surface is minimal ( @xmath19 everywhere ) .    if we apply eq .",
    "( [ eqn : schresult2 ] ) to ( [ eqn : weiermap ] ) schrdinger s equation for a minimal surface is neatly expressed in terms of @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath22 \\psi = \\varepsilon \\ \\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 . as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : weiermap ] ) , @xmath20 has the dimension of length and @xmath21 is dimensionless .",
    "hence the energies in minimal surfaces always scale as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 linear dimension of the unit cell .",
    "we can have a more transparent form when @xmath27 ( as often the case with periodic minimal surfaces , including p - surface ) .",
    "we can then exploit the stereographic map ( gauss map ) from the infinite complex plane @xmath28 to a unit sphere @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and we end up with a differential equation for @xmath29 , @xmath31 curiously , a common coefficient @xmath32 factors out for the laplacian ( the first line ) and the curvature potential ( + 1 ) .",
    "hence the kinetic and potential energies vary in a correlated manner as we go from one minimal surface to another by changing @xmath20 .",
    "we first take schwarz s p - surface as a typical triply - periodic ( periodic in @xmath33 ) minimal surface , or a `` simple cubic network of pipes '' . the weierstrass - enneper representation for the p - surface is@xcite @xmath34 , where the unit cell size is @xmath35 .",
    "a unit cell of the p - surface comprises eight identical patches , as shown in fig.[fig : surfaceunit ] . with the stereographic mapping",
    ", a unit cell is mapped onto two spheres , connected into a riemann surface via four cuts , which have to be introduced to take care of the poles in @xmath20 .    in schrdinger",
    "s equation for periodic minimal surfaces , eqn.([eqn : schonp ] ) , the variables @xmath36 can not be separated , so that we have solved the equation numerically by discretising @xmath37 to diagonalise the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the band structure is obtained by connecting the adjacent unit cells with appropriate phase factors .",
    "we now come to the result for the band structure for the p - surface in fig.[fig : bandp_d ] ( left ) .",
    "the bands are displayed on the brillouin zone for the bcc symmetry , since the p - surface happens to divide the space into two equivalent parts where a body center enclosed by the surrounding unit cells has the same shape . in accord with the above argument",
    ", the energy scale ( band width , splitting etc ) is @xmath38 .",
    "this is of the order of @xmath39 ev for @xmath40  , the unit cell size assumed for a hypothetical negative - curvature fullerene@xcite .",
    "one virtue of surfaces is we can deform one surface to another . for periodic minimal surfaces specifically , we can deform a minimal surface into another with the bonnet transformation , a conformal transformation .",
    "are the band structures for surfaces connected by the bonnet transformation related ?",
    "a beautiful asset of the weierstrass representation is that the bonnet transformation is simply represented by a phase factor , @xmath41 , in eqn.([eqn : weiermap ] ) , where @xmath42 is called the bonnet angle .",
    "the p - surface ( cubic ) is bonnet - transformed@xcite into the g - surface ( gyroid with @xmath43 ) and the d - surface ( diamond with @xmath44 ; bottom panels in fig.[fig : surfaceunit ] ) .",
    "we can first note that , since the bonnet transformation preserves the metric tensor and the gaussian curvature , the surfaces connected by a bonnet transformation obey the identical schrdinger equation within a unit patch .",
    "this is readily seen in eqn.([eqn : schonp ] ) , where @xmath20 only enters as @xmath45 , so @xmath46 does not alter the equation .",
    "however , this does not mean that the band structures are identical , since the way in which unit cells are connected is different among them .",
    "[ fig : bandp_d ] compares the band structures for the p- and d - surfaces . while the band structures are indeed different , the band energy at _ special points _ ( brillouin zone corners , edges and face - centers ) have curiously identical set of values between different surfaces .",
    "to be precise , the ` law of correspondence ' between p - surface @xmath47 d - surface is @xmath48 , h @xmath47 @xmath48 , r and n @xmath47 x , m , which can be shown from the phase factors connecting the different patches .",
    "the band structure of atomic networks such as the c@xmath0-zeolite or the negative curvature fullerene is expected to basically reflect the properties arising from the curved surface on which the atoms are embedded , as far as the effective - mass formalism is applicable and effects of the `` frustration '' in the atomic configuration ( odd - membered rings ) are neglected . to see this ,",
    "let us investigate the band structure of the graphite networks having a global topology similar to the periodic minimal surface .",
    "such `` sponges '' , as termed by fujita@xcite , can be systematically constructed by connecting patches of atomic arrays ( graphite fragments in the case of graphitic sponges ) . among the families of the graphite sponges theoretically proposed by fujita and coworkers@xcite , here we take a sponge family as displayed in fig .",
    "[ band_honey](a ) that is the closest realisation of the p - surface .",
    "we have calculate its band structure in the single - band tight - binding model .    the results in fig .",
    "[ band_honey](b ) shows that the bands in a low - energy regime ( @xmath49 ; @xmath50 the tight - binding hopping ) has a one - to - one correspondence with those for the p - surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bandp_d ] , left ) , which is natural since the effective - mass approach should be valid there . to be precise",
    ", there are extra degeneracies in the sponge due to a symmetry in the atomic configuration .",
    "naturally the correspondence with the continuous case is degraded for higher - energy regions , since the similarity holds only when the de - broglie wavelength is greater than the atomic separation .",
    "conversely , we can say that the electronic structure in the low - energy region is basically determined by the structure of the curved surface on which the atoms reside .",
    "we have formulated schrdinger s equation for free electrons bound on periodic minimal surfaces , and obtained the band structures for p- and d - surfaces , which are bonnet transformation of each other . while we have compared the tight - binding band for an atomic sponge network with those for the continuous periodic surface in the low - energy region ,",
    "the relevant region is rather a higher ( @xmath51 ) one . for this",
    ", we have a zero - mass dirac ( i.e. , weyl ) particle as far as the effective - mass picture for graphite is concerned .",
    "so we should deal with a dirac electron on periodic minimal surfaces , which should contain a richer physics , and the study is under way@xcite .    while we have taken only p- and d - surfaces , g - surface , whose geometry is considered to be realised in a class of zeolite@xcite , is distinguished from the other ones in that it has a triply chiral ( i.e. , spiral ) symmetry . it is known that a spiral symmetry makes bands to stick together , so it would be interesting to examine how the band structure in g - surface reflects this .",
