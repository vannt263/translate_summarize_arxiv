    "development of superconducting circuits with very low levels of noise is largely motivated by their potential applications for quantum computing devices@xcite , ultra - sensitive detectors@xcite and magnetometers@xcite .",
    "performance of all these devices is limited by the level of intrinsic noise of various types . a dramatic progress",
    "was achieved recently with the elimination of the amorphous insulators and/or suppression of the charge noise associated with them@xcite .",
    "this requires minimizing the use of arrays of josephson junctions as inductance elements in these circuits .",
    "the use of magnetic self - inductance of wires and coils is not feasible due to size and geometry restrictions in these devices .",
    "high kinetic inductance appears naturally in disordered superconductors which makes them an obvious candidate for these elements .",
    "here we show that disordered superconducting wires show significant fluctuations of kinetic inductance due to electron interference induced by defect motion ; we develop a quantitative analytical theory of this quantum interference effect and calculate the amplitude of the kinetic inductance fluctuations and noise with accurate numerical coefficients .",
    "the noise due to these fluctuations provides a natural limit for the quality of kinetic inductance elements@xcite .",
    "kinetic inductance noise is caused by local fluctuations of impurities invariably present in metallic wires .",
    "quantum interference of electrons moving diffusively in the potential of impurities significantly enhances the effect of these local fluctuations .",
    "this is because the macroscopic interference pattern in a conductor is very sensitive to the position of individual impurities .",
    "motion of a single impurity , for example an impurity jumping between two stable spatial configurations , results in a substantial fluctuation in macroscopic ( or rather mesoscopic ) properties of the conductor .",
    "this effect was analyzed in great detail for the case of metals in the normal state@xcite in which the quantum interference leads to mesoscopic noise , i.e. a substantial enhancement of the noise in electronic characteristics due to local fluctuations in the impurity potential .",
    "the quantum interference pattern in the normal state is spatially correlated up to the length scale , @xmath0 , that limits the coherent propagation of electrons .",
    "@xmath0 is typically set by low energy electron - electron or electron - phonon scattering@xcite . in superconductors ,",
    "where electrons at low energies are bound into cooper pairs similarly to the case of normal metals macroscopic characteristics demonstrate mesoscopic fluctuations@xcite .",
    "however , the spatial correlations of mesoscopic fluctuations in a superconductor are distinct from those in normal metals .",
    "paired state of electrons in presence of disorder is characterized by a superconducting coherence length @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath3 is the superconducting gap , which describes a typical diffusion path of an electron during a time @xmath4 , a lifetime of a virtual excitation with the energy of order @xmath3 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the role of the dephasing length in superconductors is played by the superconducting correlation length , i.e. @xmath5 defines the scale of exponential phase relaxation and limits the quantum interference responsible for the variation of macroscopic characteristics .",
    "however , we will show that this intuition is not fully consistent with microscopic calculations .",
    "instead , we find that the superconducting gap @xmath3 limits the coherence of electronic states however the phase relaxation has a slow non - exponential character .",
    "the slow phase relaxation results in an enhanced amplitude of noise in superconductors and non - linear scaling of the noise amplitude with the strength / number of locally fluctuating impurities in thin films and wires .",
    "this behavior is in contrast to the exponential phase relaxation in the case of weak localization corrections to the superfluid density of s - wave superconductors@xcite .",
    "experimentally , the noise in the normal state conductivity associated with quantum interference is a well established phenomena@xcite . in contrast",
    ", the noise in kinetic inductance of josephson circuits was reported to be absent in early experiments@xcite and observed only very recently in ref .  .",
    "this work@xcite also reports a surprising degree of correlations between the inductance noise and flux noise in the superconducting devices that remain poorly understood@xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is the quantitative prediction of the average amplitude @xmath6 of the mesoscopic noise in the kinetic inductance @xmath7 in superconducting wires . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 correspond to the value of kinetic inductance given impurity potential @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "in realistic measurement the two distinct impurity potential realization @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent different moments in time , and the amplitude @xmath12 is averaged over long periods of time , longer than any characteristic time of the electronic system , and longer than the characteristic fluctuation time of impurities .",
    "practically , this amplitude can be connected to the amplitude of the noise spectral density .",
    "is long enough .",
    "the noise amplitude @xmath13 can be connected to the noise power spectra typically measured experimentally .",
    "we assume that scattering centers responsible for the noise can be modelled by a system of bistable tunneling defects with a lorentzian noise spectrum characterized by a tunneling time @xmath14 with the distribution @xmath15 , @xmath16 . for a typically considered model of @xmath17 for @xmath18 and the normalization coefficient given by @xmath19 .",
    "for this model the amplitude of the noise can be related to the power spectra , @xmath20 this defines the meaning of @xmath21 which is the density of defects integrated over a broad bandwidth . ]",
    "we consider a finite size rectangular piece of a superconductor of a mesoscopic size @xmath22 .",
    "in other words the dimensions of the superconductor are not too much larger than the superconducting coherence length .",
    "we show that in three dimensional samples , @xmath23 the result is given by ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 , is fermi wave vector , @xmath26 is the mean free path , @xmath27 coherence length of the superconducting electrons , @xmath28 is the wire volume and the numerical coefficient is @xmath29 .",
    "the relative density of thermally activated defects is defined by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the elastic relaxation rate of electrons and @xmath32 is the part due to fluctuating defects . the ratio @xmath33 is roughly linear in temperature and is determined by @xmath34 , the relative density of states of thermally fluctuating defects that is only weakly material dependent@xcite .",
    "the remaining parameters that determine the strength of the fluctuations @xmath35 and @xmath5 can be determined from independent measurements .",
    "the noise amplitude grows rapidly as the device becomes smaller and more disordered . as a result ,",
    "this mechanism is likely to be the dominant source of inductance noise in small and highly disordered devices .",
    "( [ 3dnoise ] ) holds for three dimensional wires with thickness @xmath36 , we will see that the fluctuations get rather larger for very thin , two and one dimensional , wires @xmath37 .",

    "( [ 3dnoise ] )  and  ( [ eq : stsinductance ] ) can be derived from the following qualitative argument .",
    "we first estimate the amplitude of the sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "consider a small cubic piece of a superconductor of the size @xmath40 with @xmath41 at these scales the coherence of electrons is weakly affected by the superconductivity .",
    "optical sum rule @xmath42 and anderson theorem of gap disorder independence imply that superfluid response is directly related to normal state conductivity  @xcite .",
    "therefore the fluctuations of the normal state conductivity @xmath43 roughly translate into fluctuations of the superfluid response , @xmath44 .",
    "conductance fluctuations of a small piece of metal have a universal value @xmath45 .",
    "thus , one expects that the maximal change in the interference pattern correspond to the relative change of the superfluid response by @xmath46 in three dimensional wires .",
    "this is the amplitude of sample - to - sample fluctuations of a mesoscopic size piece of superconductor .",
    "we now estimate the fluctuation of the superfluid response during the time @xmath47 . during the time",
    "@xmath48 a small number of defects change their position in space , which means that in contrast to the sample - to - sample fluctuations only a small number of electronic paths are affected , resulting in a smaller value of the fluctuation of the superfluid response .",
    "we expect the fluctuation to be proportional to the number of paths affected by the motion of the defects . a typical path of a diffusive electron that enters and exits a cube of size @xmath49 has a length @xmath50 , the probability that the concentration @xmath51 of randomly positioned thermally activated impurities affect this path is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the scattering cross - section of the fluctuating impurities .",
    "assuming that the fluctuating and static impurities are roughly equivalent we can relate @xmath54 , where @xmath43 is the average scattering cross - section for all impurities and @xmath55 is the total impurity concentration . combining all these factors together we get @xmath56 .",
    "we assume for the sake of this estimate that in a larger sample @xmath57 the information of the single electron phases is lost on the scale of the coherence length @xmath5 .",
    "this implies that the regions of the size @xmath5 fluctuate independently .",
    "electromagnetic response of the whole sample is obtained by adding these regions as independent resistor network , adding @xmath58 independent factors we get eq .",
    "( [ 3dnoise ] ) for the fluctuating part of the kinetic inductance .",
    "the fraction of the paths affected has to be modified as well @xmath59 . combining these factors we obtain eq .",
    "( [ 3dnoise ] ) .",
    "we will see that the assumption of uncorrelated fluctuations on the scale of @xmath5 is violated in the case of thin films and wires .    in the next section  [ sec : sample - to - sample ]",

    "a small supercurrent is injected into the wire , along @xmath61 axis , by an external source and the resulting phase difference is measured , for example with josephson junctions .",
