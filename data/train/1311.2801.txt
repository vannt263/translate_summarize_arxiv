    "in the last years , the black hole physics has received an increasing attention in the context of supergravity theories embedded in superstrings and m - theory compactified on calabi - yau manifolds[1 - 8 ] .",
    "a particular emphasis has placed on the study of extremal black solutions in various dimensions .",
    "this concerns the attractors of extremal black holes and branes . in this way ,",
    "the corresponding effective potentials and entropy functions have been computed in terms of the u - duality black brane charge invariants @xcite .",
    "more recently , a special effort has been devoted to study the black hole solutions in two - dimensional models of the dilaton gravity @xcite .",
    "this black hole solution has been subject to some interest not only because of its connection with the conformal field theories but also from its connection with the cosmological models embedded in heterotic m - theory theory compactification in the presence of the dilaton coupling functions @xcite . in such models ,",
    "the bekenstein - hawking entropy has been investigated and explicitly calculated .",
    "the black hole thermodynamics in two dimensional dilatonic models have been also studied by several investigation groups@xcite .",
    "it has been shown , in many places , that the black hole thermodynamics can open gates to understand the quantum features of gravity theory .",
    "it is possible to explore such thermodynamic properties to study certain field theory models using recent string theory technics including ads / cft conjecture .    on the other hand , the f(r)-gravity theories , in the presence of a scalar field ,",
    "have been extensively studied in the connection with cosmological models embedded in superstring models and m - theory@xcite .",
    "in particular , a new f(r)-gravity theory with a lagrangian density involving an arctangent function has been studied in @xcite . the corresponding static solutions and the potential of the scalar field",
    "have been obtained , showing a good agrement with the planck data .",
    "the aim of this work is to contribute to these activities by presenting a black hole solultion in two dimensional dilaton gravity in the presence of an inflationary potential .",
    "more precisely , we consider an arctangent potential background , explored in the brane world cosmology , to build a two dimensional black hole solution . up to some limit conditions , it has been shown that this black hole geometry recovers some known results , including the schwarzchild and anti de sitter black holes . using the complex path analysis ,",
    "the hawking radiation is computed and commented in terms of known black hole solutions .",
    "then we calculate the entropy function .",
    "this function can be related to the value of the potential at the horizon .",
    "in this section , we study two dimensional black hole solutions in the presence of an effective potential used in brane world    to get two singular two - dimensional dilatonic black hole solutions , one should first start with the most general lagrangian involved in the dilatonic gravity in @xcite @xmath0 then , one performs the following conformal transformation @xmath1 with @xmath2 in fact , the kinetic term @xmath3 can be absorbed in the redefinition of the @xmath4 function . indeed , redefining the potential as @xmath5 , and transforming the kinetic term , one gets the action appearing in @xcite @xmath6 it is worth noting that the field equation for the scalar field @xmath7 obtained from this action does not contain derivative terms .",
    "in fact , this should be equivalent to the action involving the higher derivative with only the gravitational field namely @xcite @xmath8 it turns out that the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) can be extended by introducing @xmath9 conformally coupled scalar fields @xmath10 @xcite @xmath11 however , the corresponding equations of motion are not easy to deal with . for this reason ,",
    "we consider here the simplest case without conformal coupling matter fields .",
    "the general study might be examined in future works using sophisticated numerical analysis .    in connection with the higher dimensional theories",
    ", this action could be obtained from m - theory on nine dimensional compact manifolds .",
    "indeed , within heterotic m - theory framework , the internal space can be identified with the calabi - you fourfolds fibred by the orbifold @xmath12 obtained by implementing the @xmath13 action on the circle coordinate . in this way",
    ", the corresponding models can be derived from a three dimensional heterotic m - theory with orbifold data @xcite . in the heterotic m - theory ,",
    "the models associated with this action can be controlled by the @xmath14 and @xmath4 functions depending on the scalar field known by the dilaton in string theory and related models .",
    "assuming that this action can be obtained from the superstring compactification down to two dimensions and varying it with respect to the dilaton scalar field , one gets @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "however , the variation with respect to the metric tensor yields @xmath17 in what follows , we discuss a two - dimensional dilatonic black hole in a special background based on a potential explored in the inflationary brane physics .",
    "precisely , we consider a spheric symmetric static solution , in the schwarzschild like gauge , given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a scalar function specified later one in terms of the inflationary cosmological date including the potential .",
    "this metric can be obtained generally from a @xmath20 dimensional static spherically symmetric solution @xmath21 using the compactification on the @xmath22-dimensional sphere .",
    "the metric function @xmath19 is determined by fixing the @xmath14 and @xmath4 functions .",
    "indeed , we take a particular value of the dilaton scalar field given @xmath23 .",
    "the above equations can be reduced to @xmath24 together with @xmath25 technical calculations give the following equations @xmath26 having fixed the @xmath4 function , the model will depend now only on the potential form .",
    "it turns out that there are many physical potentials incorporated in string theory and related models including m and f - theories moving on orbifold fixed spaces @xcite .",
    "such potentials have been used in the moduli stabilization in stringy cosmological models .",
    "in fact , the scalar potential shape turns out to be essential in the elaboration of stringy inflationary models .",
    "the well studied models are the chaotic inflation potential reported in @xcite and the minimal supersymmetric standard model inflation discussed in @xcite . besides such examples , there are several other models which have been also investigated in the literature .    to keep contact with the brane inflationary models , we will consider a cosmological potential satisfying the limiting curvature condition proposed in @xcite .",
    "this inflationary potential takes the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a constant .",
    "this constant represents the large field approximation .",
    "it is worth noting that this potential has many nice cosmological properties@xcite . in particular , for very small values of the dilaton scalar field , it behaves as the chaotic one .",
    "more precisely , when @xmath29 is very close to zero , at second order , a chaotic inflation scenario can be recovered @xcite . moreover , the taylor expansion at order 10 can reproduce the mssm inflation potential studied in@xcite .    after specifying the above functions , we are now in position to derive the associated @xmath19 metric function producing a two dimensional black hole solution .",
    "this can be done according to the analysis presented in @xcite . to present such solutions , let us first take some conditions on the dilaton field given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a constant .",
    "after calculation , we get @xmath32-\\arctan[\\alpha^2r^2])\\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\frac{\\lambda}{\\alpha\\sqrt{2}}(\\arctan[1+\\alpha \\sqrt{2}r]-\\arctan[1-\\alpha \\sqrt{2}r])+\\frac{r\\lambda}{\\sqrt{2}r_0\\alpha}(\\arctan[1-\\alpha \\sqrt{2}r_0]-\\arctan[1+\\alpha \\sqrt{2}r_0])\\\\ & + & \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\sqrt{2}\\alpha^2}log\\left[\\frac{1-\\sqrt{2}\\alpha r+\\alpha^2r^2}{1+\\sqrt{2}\\alpha r+\\alpha^2r^2}\\right]+\\frac{r\\lambda}{2\\sqrt{2}\\alpha^2}log\\left[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}\\alpha r_0+\\alpha^2r_0 ^ 2}{1-\\sqrt{2}\\alpha r_0+\\alpha^2r_0 ^ 2}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the location of the black hole horizon , and @xmath34 is a constant of the integration , fixed later one",
    ". the computed function @xmath19 is presented in figure 1 .    before going ahead ,",
    "let us comment the obtained solution .",
    "in fact , we will see that the above potential can recover some known black hole solutions in two dimensions including schwarzchild and anti de sitter ones .",
    "indeed , asymptotic regions in the moduli space for either large or vanishing values of @xmath7 produce a black hole solution controlled by the following solution @xmath35 such regions are defined when @xmath36 goes to zero or infinity that mean for large or vanishing values of @xmath7 . to see that , it is useful to consider the following radial variable transformation @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a natural number fixed later one",
    ". putting @xmath39 , we can recover the anti de sitter metric solution . in this case",
    ", the @xmath19 function tends to @xmath40 fixing again the constant of the integration to one ( @xmath41 ) and identifying the event horizon with the cosmological constant @xmath42 , the above equation becomes @xmath43 this particular value of @xmath38 reproduces the result presented in @xcite .",
    "+ taking @xmath44 , we can get the metric describing the schwarzchild black hole . in this case",
    ", the function @xmath19 becomes @xmath45 as in the previous case , setting @xmath34 to @xmath46 and identifying @xmath33 with the mass of black hole @xmath47 , one gets @xmath48 the second comment that we should add concerns the ricci scalar @xmath49 . using ( 2.6 ) , the above potential produces the following ricci scalar @xmath49 @xmath50 this quantity is finite for all positive values of the radial coordinate @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , the corresponding function is plotted below in figure 2 .",
    "it follows from this figure that the curvature remains positive .",
    "moreover , the ricci scalar function @xmath49 has a maximum at @xmath52{3 } \\alpha } $ ] .",
    "the corresponding value is given by @xmath53 the last comment concerns the mass of the obtained black hole .",
    "based on the result of @xcite , the @xmath28 parameter seems to behave as a mass term in the attractor mechanism , although it is fixed at infinity and not at the horizon .",
    "this observation is inspired from the analysis of the four dimensional brane inflation model associated with the potential given in ( 10 ) . in this way",
    ", the scalar large value has been shown to be identified with the mass of the schwarzchild black hole .",
    "it is recalled that the friedmann - robertson - walker equation in two dimensional inflation - brane ( @xmath54 ) background can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the scale factor , and where @xmath57 is the hubble parameter . in this equation",
    ", @xmath58 is related to the d1-brane tension and the planck mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath49 is the curvature of space given by @xmath59 , and @xmath60 denotes the mass of the black hole .",
    "the dynamics can be described by a perfect fluid with a time dependent energy density @xmath61 and the pressure @xmath62 is the dominate energy distribution to the inflation .",
    "the dilaton field satisfies the klein - gordon equation @xmath63 in the large field approximation , the effective potential behaves like @xmath64 . in this limit , ( [ h ] ) can be reduced to @xmath65 and the klein - gordon equation becomes @xmath66 solving the above equation , the expression of the dilatonic field is given by @xmath67 asymptotic behaviors require that @xmath68 should take very large values . in this limit ,",
    "the dilaton field is almost constant and becomes very large when @xmath69 goes to infinity . in what follows",
    ", one considers the scale factor @xmath70 taking a particular geometry given by @xmath71 and using ( [ scalfact ] ) , we get the following equation @xmath72 in the case where @xmath28 takes small values , that is in the limit @xmath73 , the mass equation becomes @xmath74 where @xmath75 has been fixed to @xmath76 .",
    "this equation relates the mass of the black hole and the asymptotic value of the potential .",
    "having constructed the black hole solution , a particular emphasis will put on discussing its thermodynamic properties including the hawking radiation and the entropy function .",
    "first , we compute the hawking radiation using a method based on the complex path analysis introduced by landau @xcite . in order to derive that",
    ", it is essential to recall such a method . assuming that @xmath19 vanishes at @xmath33 and @xmath77 is nonzero at @xmath33 and expanding it around the point @xmath33 , one obtains @xmath78      \\equiv \\mathcal{r } ( r_0)(r - r_0).\\ ] ] to show how to get the expression of the temperature",
    ", it is useful to consider an auxiliary field @xmath79 interacting with the above system and satisfying the klein - gordon equation @xmath80 expanding this equation , one finds the following expression @xmath81 to get a semiclassical wave function , one should consider the following standard ansatz @xmath82 this ansatz leads to @xmath83=0.\\ ] ] expanding @xmath84 in a power series of @xmath85 and neglecting the higher orders , one obtains @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a constant witch can be identified with the energy . the desired formula can be derived by taking a simple case corresponding to @xmath88 .",
    "indeed , we consider the usual saddle point method to calculate the semiclassical propagator @xmath89 for a particle propagating from a spacetime point @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",

    "the modulus squared of the amplitude for such a particle crossing the horizon can give the probability of the emissions . roughly , the complex analysis on the plane reveals the following expression @xmath97=\\frac{i\\pi \\mathcal{e}}{\\mathcal{r}(r_0)}+ \\text{real      part } , \\qquad     \\mathcal{s}_0[absorption]=-\\frac{i\\pi \\mathcal{e}}{\\mathcal{r}(r_0 ) } + \\text{real      part}\\ ] ] following @xcite , it has been shown that the squaring of the modulus leads to @xmath98= \\exp\\left[\\frac{-4\\pi \\mathcal{e}}{\\mathcal{r}}\\right ] p[absorption]\\ ] ] a close inspection and a comparison with hawking and hartle formulation @xmath99=e^{-\\beta\\mathcal{e}}p[absorption]$ ] , gives the following expression @xmath100 using equations(@xmath101 ) and ( @xmath102 ) , the temperature can be written as @xmath103 - 2 arctan[1+\\sqrt{2 } r_0\\alpha]+\\log\\left[\\frac{1+r_0\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}+r_0\\alpha)}{1+r_0\\alpha(-\\sqrt{2}+r_0\\alpha)}\\right]\\right)\\right|\\ ] ]     for the values @xmath104    the temperature variable allows one to define new regions in the spacetime and the moduli space . applying an appropriate approximation",

    "identifying @xmath33 with the mass of the schwarzchild black hole @xmath47 , as we made before , we obtain @xmath106 it is observed that for large or small values of the dilaton scalar field @xmath7 , the thermodynamical behavior remains the same .",
    "this can be interpreted as a possible duality between two different regions associated with the small and large values of the dilaton scalar field @xmath36 .",
    "it looks like the strong / weak coupling duality observed in superstring theory .",
    "this observation merits an investigation .",
    "moreover , a two dimensional version of stefan s law produces the total power radiated by the black hole .",
