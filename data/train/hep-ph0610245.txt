    "recently some new charmonium or charmonium - like states , such as @xmath0  @xcite , @xmath3  @xcite , @xmath4  @xcite , @xmath5  @xcite and @xmath6  @xcite were observed .",
    "@xmath6 was pinned down as the @xmath7 in 2006 pdg  @xcite , while others have not been identified . among these new states",
    ", @xmath0 has drawn people s great interest for its peculiar decay properties .",
    "@xmath0 was first observed by belle  @xcite in exclusive b decays , @xmath8 subsequently it was confirmed by cdf  @xcite , d0  @xcite and babar  @xcite .",
    "the mass of this state is @xmath9 mev and the width @xmath10 mev(0.9 c.l . ) .",
    "the mass is within errors at the @xmath11 threshold , but the width is small .    to accommodate @xmath0 in hadron spectroscopy , considerable speculations and plenty of interpretations were proposed .",
    "there are conventional @xmath12 charmonium assignments  @xcite , molecule state interpretations  @xcite , tetraquark state interpretations  @xcite , hybrid interpretations  @xcite or mixing states interpretations among them  @xcite",
    ".    features of hadron were mainly exhibited through its production and decay properties .",
    "four decay modes of @xmath0 have already been observed .",
    "@xmath13  @xcite and @xmath14  @xcite were observed by belle , @xmath15 was observed by belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite .",
    "recently , @xmath16 was observed by belle  @xcite .",
    "possible @xmath17 of @xmath0 have been suggested through these decay modes .",
    "the observation of @xmath15 indicates that its @xmath18 .",
    "analysis of angular distribution in @xmath13 favors its @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "this assignment is also supported by the observation @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "however , some analyses suggest that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are possible  @xcite .    as for the nature of @xmath0",
    ", none of the speculations is favored . in the discovery mode",
    "observed by belle  @xcite , @xmath0 was naturally expected to be the @xmath1 or the @xmath2 charmonium state due to its decay final states . however , there are difficulties in the charmonium explanations .",
    "@xmath0 seems not match any predicted charmonium state for its lower mass , narrower width and puzzling decay properties .",
    "the upper limit for the radiative transition @xmath23 set by belle  @xcite makes it difficult to identify @xmath0 with any charmonium state .",
    "the simultaneous decay of @xmath0 to @xmath24  @xcite and @xmath25  @xcite with roughly equal branching ratios is a strong implication of the `` molecule '' state assignment for @xmath0  @xcite",
    ".    if @xmath0 is a `` molecule '' or tetraquark state , there are also difficulties .",
    "the observed branching fraction of @xmath15  @xcite is much larger than theoretically predicted one for molecule states  @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the near - threshold enhancement in @xmath16  @xcite is due to @xmath0 , this mode has a branching ratio @xmath26 times larger than @xmath27 .",
    "this mode appears to be dominant and the branching ratio is much larger than the predicted one in the molecule model .",
    "so far , there is no compelling evidence to confirm one interpretation or to exclude one interpretation , more decay modes have to be searched and studied .",
    "recently , the radiative @xmath28 decay mode was suggested  @xcite .    in the charmonium explanation of @xmath0 ,",
    "one difficulty is its lower mass . in quark models ,",
    "@xmath1 was expected to have mass @xmath29 mev in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath30 mev in ref .",
    "@xcite . in general , features of charmonium",
    "are described well by quark models ( where the quark dynamics was assumed )  @xcite . in lattice ,",
    "the spectrum of charmonium was computed also  @xcite . however , the exact quark dynamics in hadron is not very clear , and lattice results may be improved . whether @xmath0 really has the lower mass difficulty requires more phenomenological examinations .",
    "recently , charmonium spectrum were analyzed in terms of regge trajectory theory  @xcite .",
    "however , the analyses were not complete for limited experimental information at that time . with more experimental information in hand (",
    "the @xmath17 of @xmath0 is believed to be @xmath21 or @xmath22 at present time ) , we can continue a further exploration of the charmonium possibility of @xmath0 and its implication through its mass relations with other charmonium states in this letter .",
    "reggge trajectory  @xcite is an important phenomenological way to describe the masses relations among different hadrons .",
    "there is resurgent interest in regge theory for much more accumulated experimental data .",
    "furthermore , some quark models need more complete experimental fits for testing  @xcite .",
    "regge trajectories are some graphs of the total quantum numbers @xmath31 versus mass squared @xmath32 over a set of particles which have fixed principle quantum number @xmath33 , isospin @xmath34 , dimensionality of the symmetry group @xmath35 and flavors .",
    "a chew - frautschi regge trajectory is a line : @xmath36 where intercept @xmath37 and slope @xmath38 depend weakly on the flavor content of the states lying on corresponding trajectory .",
    "for light quark mesons , @xmath39 .",
    "different regge trajectories are approximately parallel .    it is found that the linearity and parallelism of regge trajectories with neighborhood mesons stepped by @xmath40 in @xmath31 with opposite @xmath41 holds not well  @xcite . the intrinsic quark - gluon dynamics may result in large non - linearity and non - parallelism of such regge trajectories .",
    "however , the linearity and parallelism of regge trajectories with neighborhood mesons stepped by @xmath42 in @xmath31 with the same @xmath41 is found to hold well  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these properties of the regge trajectories with the same principle quantum number @xmath33 , another relation for regge trajectories with different @xmath33 was assumed .",
    "it was argued that the parallelism of regge trajectories with different @xmath33 ( others are identical ) may hold because of the similar dynamics in hadron  @xcite .",
    "whether this parallelism of regge trajectory holds has not been tested for the lack of data .    for radial excited light @xmath43 mesons",
    ", there exist relations between their masses and principle quantum numbers @xmath33 .",
    "these mesons consist of another kind of trajectory on @xmath44-plots  @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the slope parameter(approximately the same for all trajectories ) .",
    "hyperfine ( spin - triplet and spin - singlet ) splitting relation is another important mass relation among hadrons . in many potential models  @xcite ,",
    "the s - wave hyperfine ( spin - triplet and spin - singlet ) splitting , @xmath47 , is predicted to be finite , while other hyperfine splitting of p - wave or higher l - state is expected to be zero : @xmath48 where the deviation from zero is no more than a few mev .",
    "though these predictions are model dependent , the masses relation of the @xmath49 charmonium multiplet has been proved to hold in a high degree accuracy  @xcite .",
    "these hyperfine splitting relations of the @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 multiplets will be used as facts ( or assumptions ) .",
    "these mass relations will be studied or used to explore the charmonium spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the third section , in terms of the experimental data , all the properties of possible regge trajectories for the charmonium",
    "are studied , and an updated phenomenological analysis is made to the new states .",
    "subsequently , the linearity and parallelism of regge trajectories with neighborhood mesons stepped by @xmath42 in @xmath31 is combined with the hyperfine splitting relations of d - wave multiplets to examine some possible charmonium arrangements to @xmath0",
    ". then we analyze @xmath0 through the observed trajectory property on @xmath52-plots .",
    "some conclusions and discussions are given in the last section .",
    "in constituent quark model , @xmath43 mesons could be marked by their quantum numbers , @xmath53 , and the quantum numbers @xmath41 of quarkonia are determined by @xmath54 and @xmath55 . with the most new data for charmonium mesons  @xcite , we get table  [ table-1 ] . in this table ,",
    "the observed states are listed in the first volume , experimentally confirmed or favorable theoretical assignment of @xmath17 , @xmath53 and masses to these states are put in the sequential three volumes .",
    "entries in the last volume are information from pdg , and the states marked with a `` ? '' are those not confirmed or omitted from the summary table .",
    ".spectrum of charmonium . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     with this table in hand , we can construct different possible regge trajectories , study their properties , and proceed with our analysis of @xmath0 .",
    "as we know , confirmed states in each group below construct a trajectory @xmath56 respectively .",
    "this two trajectories is shown in fig.1 .    .",
    "]    in the figure , the slope of line @xmath40 is @xmath57 , the slope of line @xmath42 is @xmath58 .",
    "it s obvious that the two trajectories are not parallel .",
    "once the parallelism of this two trajectories is assumed , a large deviation ( e.g. , @xmath59 has @xmath60 deviation from the `` ideal '' @xmath61 state ) would appear .",
    "another two trajectories with different @xmath33 are constructed by @xmath62 , @xmath63 and radial excited @xmath64 , @xmath65 , respectively , @xmath66    this two trajectories is shown in fig.2 .     and @xmath67 .",
    "]    in fig.2 , the slope of line @xmath40 is @xmath68 , the slope of line @xmath42 is @xmath69 .",
    "the discrimination of this two slopes is obvious , two trajectories are not parallel .",
    "the deviation of @xmath65 from the `` ideal '' @xmath70 is about @xmath71 .",
    "obviously , the assumption in ref .",
    "@xcite that the parallelism of regge trajectories with different @xmath33 may hold works not well for charmonium .",
    "in fact , even though the dynamics in hadrons with different @xmath33 is similar , the parallelism can not be deduced directly .    in short ,",
    "trajectories of charmonium in @xmath72-plots with neighborhood mesons stepped by @xmath40 in @xmath31 are really not parallel , and they `` fan in ''  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the use of the parallelism of these trajectories to predict new states is not reliable if the deviations are unknown .",
    "there exist other regge trajectories with neighborhood charmonium stepped by @xmath42 in @xmath31 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the linearity and parallelism of this kind of regge trajectories was found to hold well .",
    "this feature of regge trajectories for charmonium has not been tested for the lack of experimental data , it could not give more predictions either if this feature is used separately .",
    "however , once it is combined with the hyperfine splitting relation in a multiplet , the @xmath22 ( @xmath73 or @xmath74 ) charmonium possibility of @xmath0 could be examined .",
    "firstly , let us examine the @xmath75 possibility of @xmath0 . in theory ,",
    "states below construct two regge trajectories @xmath76    in this two trajectories , the @xmath77 and the @xmath78 are confirmed states , while the @xmath2 and the @xmath79 have not been fixed on .",
    "if @xmath0 is the @xmath2 state , the mass of the @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) can be derived in terms of the approximate parallelism relation @xmath81 with @xmath82 . in the meantime",
    ", the mass of the @xmath83 can be obtained due to zero of hyperfine splitting of the @xmath50 charmonium multiplet .",
    "the mass of the @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) is determined by @xmath85 with @xmath86 , where the spin average is implied .",
    "therefore , the @xmath50 multiplet is pitched down as follows @xmath87 the mass of @xmath50 spin triplets increases with the increase of @xmath31 , and the whole mass sequence is reasonable .",
    "this analysis implies that the @xmath22 @xmath73 charmonium arrangement of @xmath0 is compatible with the ordinary mass relation in a multiplet .",
    "furthermore , the analysis indicates that the @xmath88 is located around @xmath89 and the @xmath90 is located around @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath92 assignments of @xmath0 could be analyzed in a similar way . in this case ,",
    "two trajectories are consisted of @xmath93 respectively . in this two trajectories , the @xmath94 and the @xmath95",
    "are confirmed states , while the @xmath92 and the @xmath96 have not been fixed on .",
    "if @xmath0 is the @xmath92 state , the mass of @xmath96 ( @xmath80 ) is determined by @xmath97 with @xmath98 gev .",
    "once the mass of the @xmath96 is known , the mass of the @xmath99 @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) is obtained due to zero of hyperfine splitting of the @xmath51 charmonium @xmath102 with @xmath103 gev .",
    "the @xmath51 spectum are therefore determined as follows @xmath104 obviously , the spectrum is exotic ( @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 ) .",
    "that s to say , the @xmath22 @xmath74 charmonium arrangement of @xmath0 seems impossible .",
    "now , let us study the parallelism of charmonium on @xmath108-plots . from table.i",
    ", states in each group below construct a trajectory on @xmath108-plots , @xmath109 respectively .",
    "this three regge trajectories on @xmath108-plots is displayed in fig.3 .",
    "-plots for @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 charmonium . ]    in the figure , the slope of line @xmath40 is @xmath113 , the slope of line @xmath42 is @xmath114 and the slope of line @xmath115 is @xmath116 .",
    "it s clear that the difference of the slopes to this three trajectories is small .",
    "these trajectories are approximately parallel . in terms of this approximate parallelism of regge trajectories on @xmath108-plots ,",
    "some charmonium assignments to newly observed states could be examined .    as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", @xmath0 may be the @xmath21 @xmath117 candidate .",
    "@xmath3 may be the @xmath118  @xcite or the @xmath119  @xcite candidate .",
    "if @xmath0 is the @xmath1 and @xmath3 is the @xmath120  @xcite , states in each group below will construct a trajectory on @xmath108-plots : @xmath121 this five trajectories is plotted in fig.4 . if the assignments to these states are correct , five regge trajectories should be approximately parallel due to previous arguments .",
    "-plots for the @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 charmonium . ]    the slope of line @xmath40 is @xmath113 , the slope of line @xmath42 is @xmath114 , the slope of line @xmath115 is @xmath116 , the slope of line @xmath124 is @xmath125 , and the slope of line @xmath126 is @xmath127 . in this figure , it is easy to observe that the trajectory @xmath126 ( with @xmath3 involved ) intersects with trajectories @xmath42 and @xmath124 , while the trajectory @xmath124 ( with @xmath0 involved ) approximately parallels trajectories @xmath40 , @xmath42 and @xmath115 . from these observations , it is reasonable to conclude that the @xmath21 @xmath117 charmonium suggestion for @xmath0 does not contradict with possible mass relations in charmonium . as a byproduct ,",
    "the @xmath118 charmonium assignment of @xmath3 seems impossible .",
    "@xmath0 may be a four - quark state ( @xmath128[\\bar c\\bar q]$ ] tetraquark state or molecule state )  @xcite , but the four - quark state possibility of @xmath0 will not be studied here .",
    "four - quark states have been extensively studied for a long time  @xcite , unfortunately , their properties especially their dynamics and decay properties are still unfamiliar .",
    "so far , many states such as @xmath129 ( or @xmath130 ) , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , the unconfirmed @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath135 and @xmath136  @xcite have once been interpreted as four - quark state , but no one has been confirmed .",
    "the nature of @xmath0 is still unclear .",
    "in addition to its @xmath17(@xmath21 or @xmath22 ) , whether it is a charmonium state or an exotic state is still uncertain . instead of the production and decay properties ,",
    "some mass relations of @xmath0 are studied in the charmonium assignments . through these relations and some phenomenological analyses ,",
    "some assignments of @xmath0 are examined .",
    "if @xmath0 is a @xmath22 state , it may be the @xmath2 charmonium state while is unlikely to be the @xmath92 charmonium state .",
    "if it is really the @xmath2 charmonium state , the whole @xmath50 multiplet is pitched down with the @xmath88 located around @xmath89 and the @xmath90 located around @xmath91 .",
    "so far , the study of four - quark state and the study of meson near thresholds are not satisfactory .",
    "four - quark state is usually invoked to explain the special decay properties of newly observed states , which in fact may be explained also without four - quark state  @xcite .",
    "only when the properties of four - quark state are definitely clear , the four - quark state explanation of newly observed state will be satisfactory .",
    "of course , some properties in our analyses may not have firm foundation .",
    "the linearity and parallelism of regge trajectories with neighborhood mesons stepped by @xmath42 in @xmath31 may be questionable ( the deviations may be relevant to the spin - dependent interactions in quark models ) , however , the analyses here provide a complementary study of @xmath0 .",
    "these properties could be tested by more forthcoming experimental data and may give hints to the quark dynamics in hadron .",
