    "it is well - known that the free schrdinger propagator @xmath2 in @xmath3 is not bounded on the lebesgue spaces @xmath4 , except for @xmath5 .",
    "this has motivated the study in other function spaces arising in harmonic analysis . among them",
    "recently much attention has been given to the so - called modulation spaces .",
    "they can be defined similarly to the besov spaces , but dyadic annuli in the frequency domain are replaced by isometric boxes .",
    "actually , for our purposes it will be more useful an equivalent definition , in terms of the short - time fourier tranform , or bargmann transform , of temperate distributions ( see @xcite or section 2 below , where the weighted variant is considered ) .",
    "namely , for @xmath6 , consider the translation and modulation operators @xmath7 as well as the time - frequency shifts @xmath8 the short - time fourier tranform ( stft ) of a temperate distribution @xmath9 with respect to a schwartz function @xmath10 is defined as @xmath11 ( with the pairing @xmath12 conjugate linear in the second factor ) .",
    "then , for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we define the modulation spaces @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( changing window yields equivalent norms ) .",
    "in particular we have @xmath17 , whereas @xmath18-based sobolev spaces can be regarded as weighted modulation spaces as well . in short",
    ", the modulation space norm measures the position - momentum ( or time - frequency ) concentration in phase space of a function .",
    "now , it was proved in @xcite that the propagator @xmath2 is in fact bounded on @xmath19 , @xmath13 ; see also @xcite . as shown in @xcite , in the case of the fractional laplacian @xmath20 , with @xmath21 ,",
    "a loss of derivatives instead occurs .",
    "local well - posedness of the corresponding nonlinear equations , with nonlinearity of power - type , or even entire real - analytic , were also considered in @xcite .",
    "remarkably , modulation spaces revealed to provide a good framework for the global wellposedness as well , as shown recently in @xcite for several dispersive equations .",
    "the main results in this connection are now available in the recent book @xcite or in the survey @xcite .",
    "a strictly related issue is the sparsity of the gabor matrix representation , in phase space , for the corresponding propagator ; this property can be in fact considered as a microlocal form of boundedness and implies the boundedness on modulation spaces in the usual sense .",
    "however it contains much more refined information which is essential , e.g. , for the problem of propagation of singularities ; we refer to @xcite and the references therein for more detail .    a case of special interest is given by the schrdinger equation with potential , i.e.  @xmath22 , with @xmath23 real - valued .",
    "the literature about wellposedness in @xmath18-based sobolev spaces is enormous and we refer e.g.  to @xcite and the references therein . concerning the wellposedness in modulation spaces , it was proved in @xcite that if @xmath23 is smooth and has quadratic growth , i.e.  @xmath24\\times\\rd)$ ] , for @xmath25 , the corresponding propagator is bounded on @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( this result also follows from @xcite ) .",
    "instead , if @xmath23 is `` first order '' , i.e.  @xmath24\\times\\rd)$ ] , for @xmath28 , one has boundedness on every @xmath19 , @xmath13 . the main motivation of the present paper is an extension of these results in the case of non - smooth potential , say with minimal regularity .",
    "indeed , our result will apply to more general equations .",
    "looking for optimal results , one is led to consider potentials with derivatives in the so - called sjstrand class , which is nothing but the modulation space @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , in the theory of pseudodifferential operator that function space was first introduced in @xcite as a natural symbol class with minimal regularity which still gives rise to bounded operators on @xmath30 , and also on @xmath19 @xcite ( similar results hold for certain fourier integral operators as well @xcite ) . several deep results in micolocal analysis , such as the fefferman - phong inequality , keep valid for symbols ( with a certain number of derivatives ) in @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "hence that class looks the natural choice when dealing with boundedness of linear operators in modulation spaces .",
    "let us now state our results in a simplified form for a model equation ; we refer to section 2 below for general statements , which involve weighted modulation spaces as well .",
    "denote by @xmath32 and @xmath33 the closure of the schwartz space in the corresponding modulation spaces ( hence @xmath34 if @xmath35 ) .",
    "let @xmath36 be fixed .",
    "consider the initial value problem @xmath37 with @xmath38 , @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath42 for @xmath43 , @xmath44 for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 real - valued .",
    "assume moreover a mild continuity dependence with respect to @xmath49 ( narrow convergence ; see section 2 below ) and let @xmath50 .",
    "then for every @xmath51 , there exists a unique solution @xmath52,\\mathcal{m}^p(\\rd))$ ] to .",
    "moreover the corresponding propagator is bounded on @xmath53 .",
    "in the case of first order potentials we have a better conclusion .",
    "suppose in addition @xmath54 and let @xmath55 .",
    "then for every @xmath56 there exists a unique solution @xmath52,\\mathcal{m}^{p , q}(\\rd))$ ] to .",
    "moreover the corresponding propagator is bounded on @xmath57 .",
    "it is shown in remark [ remark5.2 ] that similar results do not hold if one replaces @xmath58 by the larger space @xmath59 .    for comparison ,",
    "observe that @xmath60 , but functions in @xmath1 generally do not possess any derivative .",
    "hence , the above results represent a significant improvement of those in @xcite .",
    "notice that in the special case of @xmath61th order potentials @xmath62 more refined results were obtained in @xcite , where the propagator was shown to be a generalized metaplectic operator ; see also @xcite for the corresponding problem of propagation of singularities .",
    "actually , as anticipated , we will consider much more general equations , namely of the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a second order pseudodifferential operator , whose symbol has some derivatives in @xmath31 . in this connection our results can be regarded as the evolution counterpart of the boundedness results for pseudodifferential operators with symbols in @xmath31 proved in @xcite .",
    "moreover , to our knowledge , they contain as special cases all the known continuity results of schrdinger propagators on modulation spaces .",
    "the proof of wellposedness relies on the construction of a parametrix for the forward cauchy problem , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "namely , one decomposes the initial datum in coherent states @xmath65 , i.e.  gabor atoms , where @xmath66 is a fixed window ; then a parametrix is constructed as a generalized localization operator in phase space ( a type of operators introduced in their basic form in @xcite ) that moves the gabor atoms in phase space according to the hamiltonian flow , together with a phase shift .",
    "notice that at this low level of regularity the more classical approach via wkb expansions and fourier integral operators turns out inapplicable .    finally , we will consider the corresponding nonlinear equations , with a nonlinearity @xmath67 which is entire real - analytic in @xmath68 ( e.g.  a polynomial in @xmath69 ) and we will prove that all the above results extend in that setting if the initial datum is in @xmath70 or even in @xmath71 ( in the case of first order potentials ) , at least for small time .",
    "briefly , the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the main definition and properties of modulation spaces and we state the results in full generality .",
    "section 3 is devoted to some preliminary estimates , whereas in section 4 we introduce a class of generalized localization operators which will appear subsequently .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the proof of the main results ( linear case ) .",
    "finally section 6 deals with the extension to nonlinear equations , at least for small time .",
    "the fourier transform is normalized as @xmath72 and the weyl quantization of a symbol @xmath73 is correspondingly defined as @xmath74 we recall the following easy properties , which can be checked directly : @xmath75=(d_{\\xi_j } a)^w,\\qquad [ a^w , d_j]=-(d_{x_j}a)^w\\ ] ] @xmath76 @xmath77      we have already defined in the introduction the time - frequency shifts and the stft of a temperate distribution , as well as the unweighted modulation spaces @xmath19 .",
    "here we extend the definition in the presence of a weight .",
    "we consider a positive submultiplicative even continuous function @xmath78 in @xmath79 ( @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) ; moreover we suppose in the sequel that @xmath78 satisfies @xmath82 as well as @xmath83 for some @xmath84 .",

    "one can consider the standard weights @xmath94 for which we have @xmath95 if and only if @xmath96 .",

    "a carefully inspection of the proof of theorem [ teo1 ] and the needed preliminary results shows that the only point were we used the condition on @xmath327 for @xmath328 , and @xmath329 for @xmath43 , is to pass to the algebraic expression in to the corresponding quantization in the form  where , using  , additional derivatives fall on the symbol and similarly in the proof of theorem [ teopara ] ( from to ) .",
    "however , when the symbol @xmath64 has the special form in theorem [ teo2 ] the factorization at the level of symbol for @xmath330 , @xmath142 gives a corresponding exact factorization at the level of operators , and therefore the conditions @xmath331 , @xmath43 , and @xmath332 , @xmath45 , suffice in that case .",
    "it suffices to prove that , under the present assumptions , the results in proposition [ lemma2 ] and therefore those in theorem [ teopara ] still hold for the modulation spaces @xmath102 , @xmath13 . in fact , one is left to prove that the map @xmath333 is bounded of @xmath334 .",
    "now , we have @xmath335 , so that the symplectic map @xmath336 ( we omit the dependence on @xmath337 for brevity ) has the special form @xmath338 , @xmath339 , with @xmath340 .",
    "hence the change of variable @xmath341 ( for fixed @xmath342 ) gives @xmath343 however @xmath344 since @xmath336 is a lipschitz map , and holds by assumption .",

    "we have @xmath360 for every @xmath144 .",
    "hence , the conclusion follows at once from theorems [ teo2 ] , [ teo3 ] ( with @xmath361 ) .",
    "[ remark5.2]let us observe that the initial value problem for @xmath362 is not wellposed in @xmath363 .",
    "in fact , if the initial datum is @xmath364 , the solution @xmath365 verifies ( by the invariance of @xmath59 under fourier transform ) @xmath366 now , using the window @xmath367 , an explicit computation ( cf .",

    "in this section we briefly discuss the extension of the above results in presence of a non - linearity of the type @xmath67 , where the function @xmath376 is entire real - analytic , with @xmath377 ( @xmath378 has a taylor expansion in @xmath379 , valid in the whole complex plane ) . in particular we can take a polynomial in @xmath379 .",
    "each of the theorems [ teo1][teo4 ] admits a nonlinear variant .",
    "namely , under those assumptions , we have local wellposedness in @xmath380 or even in @xmath381 ( according to the corresponding linear result ) , for @xmath27 , @xmath97 , @xmath382 , of the initial value problem for the nonlinear equation @xmath383 , where @xmath384 is the linear operator , with @xmath67 as specified above .",

    "the classical iteration scheme works in @xmath390 if the following properties are verified :    * @xmath301 is strongly continuous on @xmath391 for @xmath276 ( which also implies a uniform bound for the operator norm with respect to @xmath337 , by the uniform boundedness principle ) ; * we have @xmath392 , for @xmath393 in every fixed ball .",

    "* formula ( 28 ) ) in the case @xmath394 , @xmath395 , but the same proof extends to any weight @xmath127 satisfying @xmath382 , since one just uses the fact that @xmath380 is a banach algebra for pointwise multiplication ( the same holds for @xmath396 ) .    as far as * a ) * is concerned , it follows from the above linear results that @xmath301 is bounded on @xmath397 uniformly with respect to @xmath337 and it is strongly continuous in @xmath397 as a function of @xmath49 , for fixed @xmath389 .",
