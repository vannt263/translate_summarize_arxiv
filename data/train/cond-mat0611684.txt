    "the organic chemistry synthesis approach , applied in the field of molecular magnetism , has allowed to obtain original compounds with properties characteristic of both classical magnets and organic compounds . some of the early successes reported in this field were the finding of a purely organic ferromagnet @xcite , the experimental proof of the haldane conjecture in a molecular chain compound @xcite , or the study of single molecule magnets providing model systems for the investigation of quantum effects such as quantum tunneling of magnetization or topological interferences @xcite .",
    "another important achievement was made in the field of molecular magnetic one - dimensional ( 1d ) compounds with the design of ferrimagnetic chain compounds .",
    "they consist of magnetically quasi - isolated chains where two kinds of different magnetic centers alternate regularly .",
    "the first example was identified in a bimetallic ferrimagnetic chain compound @xcite built of mn@xmath1 ions with spin 5/2 and cu@xmath1 ones with spin 1/2 .",
    "several other types of ferrimagnetic chains were then discovered with various metallic centers , different spatial intra and interchain architectures , alternating interaction pathways within the chains , leading to different magnetic properties especially at low temperature where interchain interactions begin to play a role @xcite .",
    "not only bimetallic materials but also metallo - organic chains , in which the spin carriers are a metallic ion and an organic free radical , generally nitroxide , were synthesized and proved to enrich further the variety of magnetic behaviors @xcite .",
    "very recently , this kind of materials was reinvestigated with new questions concerning in particular the nature of the slow spin dynamics in ising like chain compounds @xcite .",
    "the slow relaxation of magnetization , in first order agreement with the theory of glauber concerning ising 1d chain @xcite , is a consequence of strong uniaxial anisotropy and also of intrachain magnetic correlations .",
    "the success of the metallo - organic route chosen by several groups hold on the use of nitronyl nitroxide free radicals ( nitr ) where r stands for an alkyl or aromatic group .",
    "this organic entity has one unpaired electron carrying a spin 1/2 , delocalized on the 5 atoms of its o - n - c - n - o fragment as shown by polarized neutron studies on a compound of very weakly interacting nitronyl nitroxide molecules @xcite .",
    "this original electronic configuration allows the radical to be coupled simultaneously to two metallic groups .",
    "these groups can be built of one magnetic 3d metallic ion m like cu , ni , mn or co , surrounded by magnetic inactive bulky organic moieties like hexafluoroacetylacetonates ( hfac ) @xcite . the use of this nitr free radical leads preferentially to antiferromagnetic intrachain coupling stronger than in bimetallic ferrimagnetic chain compounds , except in the case of some cu complexes where it is ferromagnetic .",
    "the possible cis or trans nitr - m(hfac)@xmath0 coordination scheme , determined by the r group , can produce different architectural arrangements leading to linear , zig - zag or helical chains with different magnetic properties .",
    "these were studied by caneschi _",
    "@xcite within the rich family of the mn - nitr compounds .",
    "several compounds with different r group , studied by magnetometry and epr , were shown to present a ferrimagnetic 1d behaviour . at low temperature , between 5 and 9 k , they undergo a transition towards a three - dimensional ( 3d ) long - range order ( lro ) consisting of a ferromagnetic ordering of the mn - nitr entities .    in these materials ,",
    "chains are well magnetically isolated from each other thanks to their large separation by bulky magnetically inactive organic moieties .",
    "this results in very weak interchain exchange interactions , leading to a ratio of intra to interchain interaction that reaches several orders of magnitude and a strong 1d behaviour .",
    "then it is necessary to take into account other usually neglected interactions such as the dipolar one . in pure 1d compound , lro is not expected at finite temperature , but very weak interchain dipolar interactions , reinforced by strong intrachain correlations , can induce such a 3d lro @xcite . the role of dipolar interaction is also invoked to explain the 3d magnetic ordering of high spin molecular cluster compounds @xcite .",
    "the present studied chain compound @xcite , mn(hfac)@xmath0(_r_)-3mlnn with the nitr free radical ( _ r_)-3mlnn=(_r_)-methyl[3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1_h_-imidazolyl-1-oxy-3-oxide ) phenoxy]-2-propionate , shown in fig .",
    "[ complex ] , is formed by alternating mn@xmath1 ions carrying a spin 5/2 and chiral nitronyl nitroxide free radicals .",
    "it crystallizes in the non - centrosymmetric orthorhombic p2@xmath22@xmath22@xmath2 space group .",
    "there are 4 formulas c@xmath3h@xmath4f@xmath5mn@xmath0o@xmath6 per unit cell which sum up to 304 atoms .",
    "the mn@xmath1 ions are in the center of a distorted oxygen octahedron , linked to two hfac moieties and two nitr radicals in cis coordination which gives the compound its zig - zag structure .",
    "the resulting chains propagate along the @xmath7 axis with mn - mn distances of 7.57    within the chains and of at least 11.3    between adjacent chains .",
    "each chain is surrounded by 6 others , some of those related by a screw axis .    the possibility to work with a mn(hfac)@xmath0(_r_)-3mlnn single - crystal ,",
    "sufficiently stable for neutron diffraction measurements , allowed us for the first time in this kind of metallo - organic ferrimagnetic chain , to determine unambiguously the nature of the 3d lro stabilized at low temperature and to evidence strong magnetic competition .",
    "a first magnetic investigation of this compound by macroscopic measurements was reported in ref . , and is recalled in section ii .",
    "the determination by neutron diffraction of the magnetic lro below the transition is presented in section iii.1 . since it can not be explained with the same kind of magnetic interaction than the correlations probed by magnetic measurements , a neutron diffraction experiment under a magnetic field",
    "was further performed ( cf .",

    "the macroscopic magnetic properties of mn(hfac)@xmath0(_r_)-3mlnn single - crystals were investigated by dc magnetization and ac susceptibility measurements using three superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometers .",
    "one is commercial ( 0 - 80 koe , 2 - 200 k ) .",
    "the two others , developed at the crtbt / cnrs , are equipped with a miniature dilution refrigerator : one is devoted to low field measurements ( 0 - 2 koe ) , and the second to high field ( 0 - 80 koe ) .    measurements in the three directions have shown that there is a weak uniaxial anisotropy along the chain direction ( @xmath7 axis ) .",
    "the anisotropy constant @xmath8  j.m@xmath9 was estimated from saturation magnetization and perpendicular susceptibility measurements at low temperatures .",
    "hereafter , we will focus on measurements performed along the easy axis .",
    "the high temperature characterization of the sample was made by magnetization measurements in a field of h@xmath10=10 oe from t=20 - 90 k and by ac susceptibility measurements in a field h@xmath11=1.4  oe from t=5 - 20  k. throughout these temperature ranges , the fields are small enough to ensure that the magnetization is linear in field , so that the magnetization m / h equals the linear susceptibility @xmath12 .        a 1d ferrimagnetic behavior expected from the non - compensation of the mn@xmath1 isotropic spins s=5/2 and the nitr free radical spins s=1/2 is observed above 20  k @xcite .",
    "the high temperature magnetic susceptibility is indeed compatible with a strong antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath13=-510 k between the mn and the nitr spins inside the chains @xcite which is not broken even at room temperature @xcite . therefore , at lower temperature ( below 100 k ) , the chains can be considered as @xmath14=s - s=2 effective units , ferromagnetically coupled by an exchange @xmath15 as represented in fig .",

    "this feature announces a crossover from high temperature 1d to 3d short - range correlations .",
    "the positive difference of @xmath25 indicates the presence of ferromagnetic interactions between the chains .",
    "we can estimate these interactions from a mean - field approach with the equation @xcite :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the number of first neighbor chains and @xmath28 is the total interchain exchange interaction . note that demagnetization effects are negligible in this temperature range .",
    "the fit between 5 and 20 k , shown in fig .",
    "[ figchi ] , leads to @xmath29  4 mk , which confirms the strong 1d character of the system : @xmath30 .",
    "when the temperature is further decreased , the mn - radical chain has been shown to undergo a magnetic transition at @xmath31=3 k @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the susceptibility above @xmath31 reveals a small ferromagnetic interchain interaction and in addition , at @xmath31 , the susceptibility exhibits a large peak with a magnitude equal to the inverse of the demagnetizing factor n , within the error bars in the determination of n. as a result of these observations , the transition was at first attributed to ferromagnetic lro @xcite .",
    "indeed , below @xmath31 and in moderated to strong magnetic fields , the field dependence of the magnetization seems to be well accounted for by a classical ferromagnetic order . in the high field regime , magnetization curves saturate rapidly as seen in top fig .",
    "[ figmh ] , although they do not reach the expected total saturation value until 80 koe .",
    "in fact , the curves show a non zero slope which is characteristic of the presence of a small canting , estimated to be of the order of 10@xmath32 with respect to the @xmath7 axis . at low fields , but larger than 5 oe , the magnetization curves seem to vary linearly with the field , with a slope dm / dh approximately equal to the inverse of the demagnetizing factor ( see bottom fig .  [ figmh ] ) . in addition , below 2.5  k the ac susceptibility is frequency dependent and presents thermomagnetic irreversibilities , and below 1  k magnetic hysteresis loops appear as previously reported @xcite . these properties",
    "are reminiscent of ferromagnetic behavior in the presence of pinning and depinning of domain - walls , and therefore in agreement with the hypothesis of a canted ferromagnetic order stabilized in this system .",
    "however , an intriguing behavior is observed for very low fields , h@xmath335  oe , where the m(h ) curves exhibit a negative curvature ( see the curve at 1.8 k in the inset of the bottom fig .",
    "[ figmh ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the spontaneous magnetization could not be extracted from the magnetization curves , or from arrott plots @xcite of the data .",
    "the inconsistency in the results , apparent ferromagnetic behavior without a spontaneous magnetic moment , suggests that a nonconventional lro is taking place .",

    "the experiments were performed on the two crg thermal - neutron single - crystal diffractometers , d15 and d23 , at the institut - laue - langevin high flux reactor ( ill , grenoble , france ) .",
    "both diffractometers were operated in normal - beam mode , using an incident wavelength of 1.1694 and 1.2582    for d15 and d23 respectively .",
    "the d15 experiment was aimed at determining the nuclear and magnetic structures in zero magnetic field in the 1.5 - 10 k temperature range around t@xmath34 .",
    "the d23 experiment yielded information about the evolution of the magnetic structure under magnetic field and was performed using a vertical cryomagnet ( 6 t superconducting coil ) .",
    "the sample was a very small crystal of mn(hfac)@xmath0(_r_)-3mlnn of @xmath38 4.4 mg and 1 mm@xmath39 which was held in a thin al box with apiezon grease and positioned with the @xmath7 axis vertical on the spectrometer .",
    "this set - up was chosen instead of direct gluing due to the brittleness of the sample , also very sensitive to temperature cycling .",
    "the first step of the neutron diffraction experiment consisted in refining the low temperature nuclear structure , previously determined from x - ray diffraction at room temperature with calculated h positions .",
    "the x - ray structure obtained with a rf factor of 19% suggested the presence of some disorder @xcite . for the neutron refinement purpose ,",
    "352 bragg reflections were collected on d15 at 10 k. unfortunately it was impossible to collect more reflections because of the fast deterioration of the sample upon temperature cycling .",
    "the resulting lattice parameters are a=11.84 , b=13.79 , c=20.03   .",
    "the integrated intensities corrected from the lorentz factor were calculated from the @xmath40-scans with the coll5 program @xcite .",
    "the averaging of the equivalent reflections and absorption correction were done using the arrnge and avexar programs from the ccsl library @xcite with an estimated total absorption coefficient @xmath41 of 0.12 mm@xmath42 , essentially due to the large incoherent scattering of the hydrogen atoms .",
    "the weakness of the measured signal , the presence of important structural disorder , and the small number of collected bragg reflections imposed a limit to the number of free parameters in the refinement procedure .",
    "this was achieved using a method based on rigid molecular blocks . a new implementation in the mxd program @xcite was used to handle this by adjusting , for each block of atoms , the 3 coordinates of its origin , and the 3 eularian angles parameterizing its three dimensional rotation around this point .",
    "3 main blocks were chosen on chemical grounds : the block associated to the nitr radical had free origin coordinates and free rotation angles whereas the two hfac blocks had a fixed origin with respect to the mn , only the rotation angles being free in the refinement .",
    "13 minor groups ( shown in fig . [ blocks ] ) were further selected within these main blocks , which were allowed to rotate around the parent c - c or c - o bond axis : 4 cf@xmath43 groups within the hfac blocks , 5 methyl groups , 1 phenyl group and the 4 segments of the carbonate chain linked to the phenyl within the nitr block .",
    "including one isotropic thermal factor for each kind of chemical species , this led us to fit the measured intensities with 36 refinable variables for 358 observations .",
    "the resulting structure , obtained with a weighted least square r factor of 13.2 % ( see fig .",

    "a good candidate for this interchain mechanism , often invoked in chain compounds @xcite , is the weak but long - ranged dipolar coupling .",
    "in addition to its role in the onset of 3d lro , the dipolar interaction is also argued to be responsible for the magnetic anisotropy observed in some mn - based chain compounds @xcite .",

    "non - zero values can only arise from higher order processes allowing the interaction of the ions with the crystal field , the most important mechanism being the admixtures through spin - orbit coupling of @xmath77 excited states within the ground state @xcite . in the present mn - nitr chain compound",
    ", we observe a weak axial anisotropy of the magnetic moments .",
    "they are mainly oriented along the chain axis , with a small canting .",
    "such a magnetic orientation appears to be rare in spin chains where the moments usually lie perpendicular to the chain axis .",

    "the origin of the anisotropy in the present case where the magnetic entities are mn@xmath1 and organic radicals with isotropic spins 1/2 is therefore questionable .    in order to check the role of dipolar coupling in the orientation of the spins and in the onset of a finite temperature lro",

    "the method is only briefly described in this paper but more details about the formalism may be found for instance in ref .  .",
    "we have used a general anisotropic hamiltonian which takes into account the intrachain isotropic exchange couplings ( @xmath78 k ) between nearest neighbor mn ( @xmath79 ) and nitr radicals ( @xmath80 ) , the long range anisotropic dipolar coupling between all species of magnetic atoms , as well as a local anisotropy on the manganese sites .",
    "the detail of the calculations are reported in the appendix .",
    "the role of dipolar interactions was first tested by neglecting the single - ion anisotropy term , @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting antiferromagnetic lro was found with the propagation vector @xmath82=0 , as observed experimentally .",
    "however , contrary to the anisotropy inferred from neutron scattering and magnetometry measurements , the spin orientation was found along the @xmath67 axis , i.e. perpendicular to the chain direction .",
    "consequently , the influence of the single - ion anisotropy was evaluated by introducing a local uniaxial anisotropy @xmath83 whose value was increased progressively . as results ,",
    "the antiferromagnetic structure with @xmath46=0 remains for all @xmath84 values , but the spins direction switches to the @xmath7 axis for @xmath85 values greater than @xmath86   mk .",
    "this is larger but of the same order of magnitude than the value , @xmath87 40 mk , estimated from the anisotropy constant @xmath88 obtained via the low temperature magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "note that due to some approximations made in the calculations ( the interchain exchange coupling and the small canting with respect to the @xmath7 axis were not taken into account for instance ) the results should be considered as qualitative only .",
    "these results indicate first that the dipolar interaction can not explain the anisotropy observed in the chain , contrary to the case of other mn - nitr chains @xcite .",
    "other mechanisms must then be invoked such as antisymmetric exchange or mn@xmath1 single - ion anisotropy . in support of this last explanation ,",
    "let us note that , although often negligible , large zero field splittings have been reported in the cs@xmath0mncl@xmath89.2h@xmath00 antiferromagnet ( @xmath90140 mk ) @xcite for instance and in several mn(ii ) organic compounds ( @xmath91 up to @xmath721 k ) @xcite .",
    "the single - ion anisotropy has also been proposed to be the main source of anisotropy in other mn(ii ) chain compounds @xcite .",
    "in fact , one of these compounds undergoes a transition towards an antiferromagnetic lro and is one of the rare example with the direction of the mn moments along the chain axis @xcite .",
    "the second important result of these mf calculations is that the interchain dipolar interaction produces a 3d antiferromagnetic lro with propagation vector @xmath46=0 , which is robust with respect to the spins orientation .",
    "this interaction is therefore most probably responsible for the antiferromagnetic lro observed in mn(hfac)@xmath0(_r_)-3mlnn below @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless , it seems difficult to reconcile the amplitude of the dipolar interaction between two spins in neighboring chains , @xmath92 , and the critical temperature : @xmath93 mk , for a nearest neighbor chain distance of @xmath94   , which is three orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath31=3 k.    as shown below , this apparent contradiction can be resolved as soon as one considers the intrachain correlations developing at low temperatures , which build super spins made of a temperature dependent number of strongly correlated individual spins .",
    "the critical temperature can be calculated in a mean field approach , considering only intrachain exchange and interchain dipolar interaction . to describe the low temperature behavior of quantum - classical ferrimagnetic chains in the heisenberg model ,",
    "let us consider a single chain as independent quasi - rigid blocks , or super spins , of length @xmath95 and total moment @xmath96 with @xmath97 ( @xmath98=5/2 and @xmath99=1/2 ) .",
    "the correlation length is then @xmath100 with @xmath101 ( @xmath102=-510  k the intrachain correlation ) @xcite .    as we know from experiments that these super spins tend to align along the @xmath7 axis of the crystal , we end up with an effective model of pseudo ising super spins @xmath103 distributed on a distorted triangular lattice and interacting via the dipolar interaction .",
    "using @xmath104=1.7 mk in the previously introduced formalism , the mean - field critical temperature is given by    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the spin dimension and @xmath107 is a dimensionless constant dependent on the two dimensional super spin lattice geometry .",
    "this finally leads to : @xmath108 from which we obtain @xmath109 k. keeping in mind that the mean field approach always tends to overestimate the transition temperature , this result seems in rather good agreement with the measured @xmath110  k. perhaps even more important is that this calculation establishes that the lro is driven both by the intrachain exchange interaction which operates first and builds mesoscopic super spins ( at @xmath111 , around 80 spins are strongly correlated ) and by the dipolar interchain interaction which settles the 3d ordering temperature of these super spins .",
    "as argued , the dipolar interaction should be responsible for the 3d antiferromagnetic stacking of the chains .",
    "consequently , it can not explain the 3d ferromagnetic correlations observed above @xmath31 .",
    "these correlations must then be induced by the interchain exchange interaction in spite of the large interchain distances . indeed , although short - range in nature , the exchange interaction in molecular compounds can be mediated by the spin delocalization and polarization processes on the whole nitr molecule ( not only on the two o - n bridges of the radical ) and between several molecules @xcite .",
    "in the present structure , some c - h@xmath112o interchain paths of lentgh 2.7     can be identified , which fall within the range of weak hydrogen bonds @xcite .",
    "hydrogen bonds have been shown to be possible exchange paths between molecules @xcite .",
    "such exchange mechanism should lead to a small value of the interaction energy , which is consistent with the value of the interchain exchange obtained from the mean field approach ( @xmath1134  mk , see section ii ) and of the same order as the dipolar energy .",
    "however , the sign of this interaction can not be simply deduced from structural consideration due to the complexity of the exchange paths .",
    "note that previous magnetization measurements under pressure on mn(hfac)@xmath0(_r_)-3mlnn also concluded the existence of ferromagnetic interchain exchange @xcite . polarized neutron experiments on a single - crystal could give more information on these interactions .",
    "the unusual transition revealed by these experiments ( ferromagnetic - like susceptibility and antiferromagnetic lro ) could therefore result from the competition between the ferromagnetic interchain exchange and the antiferromagnetic dipolar interaction , and from their different sensitivity to the strong 1d magnetic behavior .",
    "decreasing the temperature leads to the formation within the chains of correlated blocks of spins whose length @xmath95 increases like the inverse of the temperature .",
    "the long - range nature of the dipolar interaction makes it more sensitive to the intrachain correlations than the exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "this is reflected by the transition temperature obtained in a mean field approach : @xmath31 increases like @xmath95 for the exchange interaction @xcite , whereas it increases like @xmath114 for the dipolar one ( eq . [ xi2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , below a certain temperature , when @xmath95 reaches a threshold value , the dominant exchange interaction leading to ferromagnetic interchain correlations can be overwhelmed by the dipolar one .",
    "this in turn should favor antiferromagnetic interchain arrangements .",
    "this interpretation of the magnetic properties of the mn(hfac)@xmath0(_r_)-3mlnn compound in terms of competition between weak exchange and dipolar interactions is supported by the magnetic behavior under weak magnetic fields . in the m(h ) curves ( see section ii ) , a small curvature appears at fields of a few oe and the intensity of magnetic bragg peaks associated with the antiferromagnetic order starts to decrease under the same field of a few oe ( see section iii ) .",
    "these observations are the signature of a fast deterioration of the zero - field antiferromagnetic ground state in favor of a ferromagnetic lro under a small field .",
    "they are consistent with the estimated strength of the antiferromagnetic dipolar interchain interaction which leads to an equivalent field of a few oe .",
    "this transition is however not characterized by an abrupt metamagnetic transition .",
    "this could be explained by a distribution of the intrachain correlation lengths @xmath95 , which is especially relevant in such compounds due to the finite size of the chains @xcite . because of the particular sensitivity of the dipolar interaction to the correlation length , a distribution of the @xmath95 values would result in a distribution of the reversal fields instead of a unique field characteristic of a well - defined metamagnetic transition .",
    "it is interesting to note a problem reported in some previously studied mn - nitr chains @xcite were ferromagnetic lro was inferred from magnetization measurements , in contradiction to dipolar coupling calculations on the same compounds that predicted an antiferromagnetic structure .",
    "furthermore , the calculations showed that ferromagnetic lro could only be stabilized in magnetic fields higher than 20 oe . in the present study",
    ", we measured similar ferromagnetic signatures by magnetometry and in addition , established the antiferromagnetic nature of the lro by neutron diffraction .",
    "the above analysis provides a scenario for the coexistence of these two types of fluctuations and suggests that the temperature ranges where each one dominates is driven by the intrachain correlation length .",
    "magnetization measurements on the mn - free radical chiral chain mn(hfac)@xmath0(_r_)-3mlnn compound have shown ferromagnetic correlations and a magnetic phase transition at @xmath1153 k , but with a puzzling behavior in the ordered regime .",
    "neutron measurements allowed to solve this intringuing problem .    in the present paper ,",
    "the resolution of the magnetic structure of this compound from single - crystal neutron diffraction measurements was obtained using specific methods of analysis ( rigid blocks refinement , symmetry analysis , `` molecular '' magnetic form factors ) in order to overcome ( i ) the weakness of the signal and the fast deterioration of this small and brittle molecular sample and ( ii ) the presence of delocalized spins on the organic free radicals . under moderate fields ( h@xmath116150 oe ) , the existence of a ferromagnetic lro , evidenced by macroscopic magnetostatic studies , is confirmed .",
    "however in zero magnetic field , the actual magnetic lro stabilized below @xmath31 is found to be an antiferromagnetic arrangement of canted ferromagnetic chains in contrast with the ferromagnetic 3d fluctuations observed above @xmath31 .",
    "this result demonstrates that two types of weak interchain interactions , of opposite signs , are in competition in this compound .",
    "as shown by mean - field calculations , the dipolar one , enhanced by the intrachain spin correlations , dominates below t@xmath34 and leads to an interchain antiferromagnetic structure that rapidly vanishes under weak magnetic field .",
    "the weak exchange interaction is mainly influent above t@xmath34 producing strong ferromagnetic 3d correlations , a ferromagnetic lro being only field - induced below t@xmath34 .",
    "these results underline the need , in the field of molecular magnetism where weakly competing processes may be active , of using both macroscopic magnetization measurements _ and _ microscopic probes such as neutron diffraction .",
