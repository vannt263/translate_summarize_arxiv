    "in recent times , various pricing models with jumps have been put forward which address the shortcomings of diffusion models in representing the risk related to large market movements ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "such models allow for a more realistic representation of price dynamics and a greater flexibility in calibration to market prices and in reproducing a wide variety of implied volatility skews and smiles .",
    "an important indicator for the riskiness and effectiveness of an investment strategy is the drawdown , which is the distance of the current value away from the maximum value it has attained to date .",
    "the drawdown may also be seen as a measure of regret as it represents the hypothetical gain the investor would have made had he sold the asset at the moment the current maximum was attained .",
    "a number of commonly used trading rules are based on the drawdown ( see e.g. @xcite ) , while ( maximum ) drawdowns have also been applied as risk - measures ( see @xcite ) .",
    "drawdown processes ( also called reflected processes ) are also encountered in various other areas , such as applied probability , queueing theory and mathematical genetics .",
    "see @xcite and references therein for further applications and results concerning drawup and drawdown processes .    in this paper",

    "we focus on the case that @xmath11 is a lvy process .",
    "the future drawdown and drawup processes are of interest in various applications , including in financial risk analysis and queueing models .",

    "similar results are obtained for @xmath55 .",
    "we also describe the law of @xmath56 _ conditional _ on @xmath57 or @xmath58 being large , which gives rise to `` asymptotic drawup measures '' @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "when the jumps of @xmath11 are all of single sign , we explicitly identify the laplace transform in time of the one - dimensional distributions in terms of the scale function of @xmath11 .",
    "as example , we analyze in detail ( future ) drawdowns and drawups under the black - scholes model , identifying in particular the mean of the value @xmath68 under the measure @xmath62 and the laws of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
