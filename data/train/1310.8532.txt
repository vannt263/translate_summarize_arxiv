    "it is now widely accepted that energy efficiency is a key parameter in designing wireless communication systems .",
    "this has catalyzed interests of many researchers inside the information / communication theory communities in order to better understand performance limits of wireless communication in the low power regime , and develop new techniques to achieve / approach these limits , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for instance , in wide band communications , although the signal strength is generally very low , one can capitalize on the huge bandwidth and still achieve a high capacity @xcite .",
    "the low - snr framework is also useful to model cellular networks in some specific cases @xcite , sensor networks where power saving is detrimental @xcite and more generally any communication scenario where the bandwidth and the power are fixed , but the system degree of freedom is large enough such that the power per degree of freedom is very low @xcite .",
    "mainly , there are two trends in the literature of communications at low - power regime .",
    "the first one focuses on studying fundamental limits in terms of channel capacity , error probability , error exponent , etc ; e.g. , @xcite . the second one deals more with signaling design and practical schemes that achieve these performance limits asymptotically , e.g. , @xcite",
    ". a comprehensive list of references regarding communications at low - power regime and energy efficiency can be found in @xcite     and @xmath0 denote the average transmit power at the transmitters , respectively .",
    "the acronyms csi - tr in the legend corresponds to the case where the csi is available at both transmitters and at the receiver as well .",
    "the acronym csi - r corresponds to the case where csi is available at the receiver only . ]    in this paper , we aim at studying the throughput capacity region of fading multi - access channels ( mac ) and fading broadcast channels ( bc ) with gaussian noise , where perfect channel state information ( csi ) at the receiver(s ) ( csi - r ) and at the transmitter(s ) ( csi - t ) is assumed , at low power regime .",
    "the throughput capacity of the gaussian mac fading channel has been derived in @xcite .",
    "therein , it has been shown that each point on the boundary surface of the capacity region can be obtained by successive decoding and that the optimal rate and power allocations can be seen as the generalization of the single - user water - filling construction to mac channels .",
    "the boundary surface is defined as the set of users rates such that no component can be increased with other components remaining fixed , while staying in the capacity region @xcite .",
    "for instance , the capacity region of a 2-user symmetric mac channel is depicted in fig .",
    "the boundary surface is the curved line joining the points b and c. differently from the nonfading gaussian mac channel where the boundary surface of the capacity region is a line with slope -1 , there is no linear part on the boundary surface of the gaussian mac fading channels capacity region .",
    "furthermore , since the horizontal line joining a and b and the vertical line joining c and d are completely defined by single user capacity bounds , then determining the boundary surface b - c is enough to fully characterize the mac capacity region . however , to obtain each point on the boundary surface , a parameterized optimization problem must be solved .    on the other hand ,",
    "the bc is generally a good model for downlink communications in cellular networks where a base station is sending common and/or independent messages to different users .",
    "the single - input single - output ( siso ) gaussian bc is by nature a degraded channel for which the capacity is known @xcite .",
    "even with fading along with perfect csi at both the transmitter and the receivers ( csi - tr ) , the capacity region has been obtained in @xcite and in the context of parallel gaussian channels in @xcite . here again , although the optimal power profile structure is essentially a water filling , an explicit characterization of the boundary capacity region seems difficult to obtain .",
    "we focus in this paper on the low power regime ( formally defined later ) and analyze the capacity region of the gaussian mac fading channel .",
    "we show that interestingly , at low power regime , the mac capacity region has a multidimensional rectangle structure , i.e. the boundary surface reduces to a single point .",
    "this point corresponds to the sum rate maximizer , the components of which are single - user capacity bounds .",
    "then , we propose an on - off scheme and provide a necessary condition on the fading channels under which this scheme achieves the boundary point so that each user achieves single - user performance as if others were turned off .",
    "using the duality of gaussian mac and bc , we provide a simple characterization of the bc capacity region at low power regime and show that for a class of fading channels ( including rayleigh fading ) , time - sharing is asymptotically optimal .",
    "we note that the conference versions of this paper @xcite contain part of the results presented herein .",
    "however , we believe that the actual version is a substantial extension of the conference versions .",
    "we highlight below the main extra contributions beyond the conference versions :    * we present an explicit and simplified power profile ( c.f . in section [ s5a ] ) that achieves any point on the boundary of the gaussian bc .",
    "its simplicity is coming from the fact that the transmitter needs not solve multi - variable equations to set the optimal power .",
    "instead , likewise in point - to - point communications , the optimal water - filling is derived by solving single - variable equations . *",
    "we provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which time - sharing is asymptotically optimal ( c.f . in section [ s5a ] ) , thereby fully characterizing the class of fading channels for which time - sharing is asymptotically capacity - achieving .",
    "illustrative examples ( example [ ex1 ] and example [ ex2 ] in section [ s5a ] ) are given to support this result .",
    "* we include the proof of lemma [ l1 ] ( appendix [ appendix1 ] ) which is instrumental to the prof of our main result ( theorem [ t1 ] ) .",
    "* we insert the proof of theorem [ t2 ] ( appendix [ appendix3 ] ) which we believe is an important result that characterizes the capacity of point - to - point communications at low power regime . while this result is instrumental to the optimality of the on - off power control for the mac channel ( c.f . in section [ s4 ] ) , it could be also of independent interest .",
    "* we reinforce our numerical results and include in all figures the capacity regions of the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel and the corresponding fading with channel state information at the receiver ( csi - r ) only as benchmarks .",
    "we also include fig .",
    "[ f10 ] as an evidence that time - sharing might not be optimal at low power regime for the log - logistic broadcast fading channel as discussed in example [ ex2 ] .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "section [ s3 ] contains the main result of this paper along with its proof .",

    "finally , section [ s6 ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider an uplink scenario where @xmath1 users are communicating with a base station .",
    "all terminals have a single antenna each , i.e. , a siso mac channel .",

    "we also assume without loss of generality a normalized gaussian noise so that @xmath18 .",
    "the transmitter is constrained by an average transmit power @xmath19 .",
    "we focus on fading processes with continuous probability density function ( pdf ) and with infinite support ( although the later assumption is not mandatory ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the channel gains of all users are independent , but not necessarily identically distributed . in addition , in both the mac and the bc described by and , respectively , perfect csi - tr is assumed , implying that at time instant @xmath2 , each terminal knows perfectly all channel gains @xmath5 , @xmath14 . for convenience ,",
    "we let @xmath20 .",

    "finally , bold face letters indicate vectors of dimension @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "in this section , we first present our main result in theorem [ t1 ] followed by the proof .",
    "[ t1 ] let @xmath31 be the multidimensional rectangle defined by the single user capacities , i.e. , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the single user capacity of user @xmath8 , with average transmit power @xmath34 , and with perfect csi - tr . for the siso mac described by ( [ e201 ] ) , the capacity region @xmath35 coincides with @xmath31 at asymptotically low power regime .",

    "we note first that there is no loss of rigor by considering @xmath38 in although @xmath39 depends only on @xmath34 .",
    "then , since our focus is on asymptotically low power regime , both @xmath31 and @xmath35 collapse to the zero point . however , the characterization of the capacity region adopted in theorem [ t1 ] is in the sense that the limit of the ratio between the achievable rate and the single user capacity is equal to 1 as @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we want to show that @xmath41 , the point on boundary surface of the capacity region , @xmath42 is independent of @xmath43 , i.e. , all surfaces parameterizing the boundary surface of the capacity region intersect in exactly one point .",
    "this direct approach seems a bit complicated since the expression of @xmath44 in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.16 ) is somehow complicated . instead",
    ", we adopt an information - theoretical approach to prove theorem [ t1 ] .",
    "clearly , the region on the right hand side ( rhs ) of is an upper bound on the mac capacity region since the former is only constrained by single user capacities of all users . to show that all points in this set are achievable",
    ", it suffices to sow that the point @xmath45 is asymptotically achievable . for this purpose ,",
    "let us compute @xmath42 for @xmath46 , i.e. , the point on the boundary of the capacity region that maximizes the sum rate .",
    "the @xmath8th components , @xmath14 , of this point is given by @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 denote the probability density function ( pdf ) of the channel gain power @xmath50 and its cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) , respectively ; and where the constants @xmath51 s satisfy @xmath52 let us define a function , say @xmath53 , as the rhs of , i.e. , @xmath54 for positive @xmath55",

    "the intuition behind is that at low power regime , @xmath58 which has an interpretation of the power cost , converges toward infinity since at low power regime , the power becomes more expensive .",

    "the strategy to achieve this is the same as the one that maximizes the sum rate , a time - division multiple - access strategy where at most one user is allowed to transmit at any given state .",
    "we note that since in the mac scenario we perform water - filling over the maximum of users channel gains @xmath78 to achieve the maximum sum - rate , whereas in the single - user case , we perform water - filling on @xmath79 , for each individual user , then these rates seem to be different a priori . however , the two strategies perform similarly at asymptotically low power regime as stated by theorem [ t1 ] . at low power regime , since the power cost @xmath80 , for all @xmath14 , if each user transmits only when its channel gain is  extremely good \" ( @xmath81 ) , then this channel gain is the strongest with high probability .",

    "let @xmath108 be that limit , i.e. , @xmath109 .",

    "we do not assume that the fading channels considered herein have an igfr ; however , we focus on fading channels with @xmath110 as the later condition is less restrictive than the igfr property .",
    "first , let us digress from the mac setting and focus on a siso point - to - point communication with perfect csi - tr and claim the result in theorem [ t2 ] that characterizes the capacity of this class of fading channels at low power regime .",
    "[ t2 ] let @xmath109 . for fading channels with @xmath110 ( including @xmath116 ) ,",
    "the capacity of the discrete - time memoryless channel described by @xmath117 , @xmath3 , with perfect csi - tr and under an average transmit power constraint @xmath13 , is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the water level corresponding to the capacity - achieving power profile .",
    "furthermore , an on - off signaling defined by @xmath120 where @xmath121 , is asymptotically capacity - achieving .",
    "the proof is presented in appendix [ appendix3 ]    theorem [ t2 ] provides an asymptotic expression of the capacity over a wide class of fading channels . should a specific fading be chosen , the lagrange multiplier @xmath122 can be explicitly expressed in function of the average power @xmath13 .",
    "for instance , considering rayleigh or the more general nakagami - m fading , one can easily verify that @xmath123 , for both fading .",
    "hence , they belong to the class of fading we are focusing in .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath124 .",
    "hence , using theorem [ t2 ] , it can be seen immediately that the capacity scales essentially as @xmath125 at low power regime .",
    "note that this result is in full agreement with the ones established via different techniques in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "needless to recall that at asymptotically low power regime , the lagrange multiplier @xmath126 converges toward infinity .",
    "the proof is technical and can be found in appendix [ appendix3 ] .",
    "however , the intuition behind this fact can be easily understood by giving to @xmath126 its economic interpretation as the power price . since at low power regime",
    ", the power becomes more expensive , then it is natural that @xmath126 increases indefinitely as @xmath85 .",
    "note that for the class of fading channels in theorem [ t2 ] , it has been shown in @xcite that the ratio of the capacity and @xmath13 goes to infinity .",
    "theorem [ t2 ] describes this behavior more precisely stating that the capacity per unit power goes to infinity as @xmath127 .",
    "this is in fact the capacity gain provided by perfect csi - t , but the second statement of theorem [ t2 ] clearly emphasizes that 1-bit feedback is actually enough for this to be true and proposes a general capacity - achieving on - off scheme that yields this gain .",
    "finally , we note that in order for theorem [ t2 ] to apply , we only require the @xmath108 to be positive .",
    "we do not claim that this condition is necessary , but we have verified that for all typical wireless channels encountered in the literature , this condition holds true . for instance , for rayleigh ,",

    "this rate corresponds to the asymptotic capacity described by theorem [ t2 ] and hence is the best rate we can achieve .",

    "these bits identify the user @xmath8 , @xmath146 , if any , that is allowed to communicate at that fading realization .",
    "furthermore , while at asymptotically low power regime , both tdma and the proposed on - off scheme are optimal , as far as the optimality criterion is in the limit sense ; we argue that the proposed on - off is easier to implement than tdma .",
    "this is because in tdma , the active user requires perfect csi of its channel gain to perform a water - filling , whereas this is not necessary for the proposed scheme as a constant power is used instead .",
    "in order to characterize the bc capacity region at low power regime , we utilize the established duality between the gaussian mac and bc so that we can deduce the bc capacity region from that of the mac given in theorem [ t1 ] @xcite .",
    "recall that the duality implies that the capacity region of the bc with power @xmath19 , is exactly equal to the capacity of the dual mac , which has the same channel gains , and a sum power constraint of @xmath19 across all @xmath1 transmitters .",

    "we also note that from the proof above , since each point on the bc boundary region corresponds to a sum rate maximizer of a certain dual mac , then to achieve a given point on the boundary of the bc capacity region , an optimal strategy is to use the mac - bc transformation in each fading state to find a bc power policy that achieves the same average rate as the corresponding dual mac @xcite .",
    "that is , at any given state , the transmitter allocates all the power to at most one user as follows : @xmath170^{+ } & \\text{if } \\gamma_{k } > \\frac{\\lambda_k}{\\lambda_j } \\gamma_k , \\ ; \\forall j \\\\ 0 & \\text{else } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 s are solution of @xmath171 , for @xmath14 .",

    "let us first recall the expression of the single user capacity that depends only on the power constraint and not on the lagrange multiplier @xmath92 as established in appendix [ appendix3 ] : @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the inverse function of @xmath183 and where the function @xmath183 is defined on @xmath90 by @xmath184^{+}\\right]$ ] .",
    "we note that although not explicit , is interesting in the sense that it gives a simple expression of the capacity that does not depend on @xmath92 and that is valid for an arbitrary @xmath19 value .",

    "we note that for these channels , @xmath189 .",
    "hence , for these popular fading channels , time - sharing among users achieves the boundary of the capacity region @xmath149 .",
    "however , property does not hold in general as evidenced by the following example .",

    ", it can be shown that the lagrange multiplier @xmath192 . therefore , property does not hold in this case since @xmath193 . hence , for these fading channels , time - sharing among users is strictly suboptimal .",
    "we present numerical results for a 2-user mac channel where both users undergo independent rayleigh fading channels . in all figures ,",
    "we depict the actual throughput capacity region obtained numerically using the characterization in ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , the convergence of tdma s region toward the capacity region is faster than that of the proposed scheme .",
    "note that the ratio between the maximum on - off achievable rate and the single user capacity bound of the mac capacity region increases from 0.9 for @xmath194 db in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , to 0.95 for @xmath195 db in fig .",

    "[ f5bis ] a plot that describes the ratio @xmath197 , between the rate achieved by the proposed on - off scheme and the single user capacity , versus @xmath196 .",

    "similar observations can be noted from fig .",
    "[ f5 ] for @xmath199 db and @xmath200 db . it is also worthwhile to observe that the ratio between the achievable rate and the average power increases with the power budget .",
    "this implies that a better spectral efficiency is achieved at low power regime .",
    "since this ratio has dimension of spectral efficiency per unit power ( bits per second per hertz over joules per second ) , we found it more convenient to call it spectral efficiency per unit power ( sepup ) , the unit of which is bits per hertz per joule ( b / hz / j ) .",
    "furthermore , one may define a sepup region for the mac that describes the maximum spectral efficiency per unit power users can achieve .",
    "the sepup region follows in a straightforward manner from the capacity region of the mac channel .",
    "indeed , in a @xmath1-user mac channel , given a transmit power budget @xmath201 of the users , each point of the capacity region defined by @xmath202 , specifies a point of the sepup region , say @xmath203 , such that @xmath204 .",
