    "e+a galaxies possess a characteristic spectral signature defined by strong hydrogen balmer absorption lines ( h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 ) combined with a lack of optical emission lines such as [ oii ] @xmath4 ( dressler & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "the balmer absorption lines are imprinted in the galaxy spectrum by a stars , indicating the presence of a young ( @xmath7 gyr old ) stellar population .",
    "however , the absence of [ oii ] @xmath4 emission suggests that star formation is no longer ongoing .",
    "the inference is that these galaxies have previously undergone a burst of star formation , which has recently been truncated rather suddenly ( dressler & gunn 1983 ; couch & sharples 1987 ) .",
    "for this reason , these systems are also known as ` post - starburst galaxies ' .",
    "the physical mechanisms governing the triggering and cessation of this starburst are not yet fully understood , but undoubtedly reflect the interaction of the galaxy with its environment . in general , this can occur through interaction with other galaxies ( mergers or tidal gravitational effects ) or , for those galaxies residing in clusters , through effects specific to that environment ; involving either the hot intracluster gas ( ram - pressure effects ) or the cluster gravitational potential .",
    "theoretical modelling of all these scenarios is not yet complete , although it is known that a major galaxy merger can produce the characteristic e+a spectral signature ( bekki , shioya & couch 2001 ) .",
    "in practice , more than one of the above mechanisms is probably responsible for the overall population of e+a galaxies , with different mechanisms operating in different environments .",
    "as such , these galaxies are an interesting probe of environmental influences on galaxy evolution .",
    "the population of e+a galaxies exhibits dramatic evolution with redshift .",
    "these galaxies are commonplace in intermediate - redshift clusters , where they were first identified and studied ( dressler & gunn 1983 ) : ` e ' and ` a ' representing respectively the assumed morphology and the dominant stellar lines of the spectrum , although high - resolution hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging of such clusters later revealed that these galaxies were predominantly early - type disk systems ( couch et al .  1998 ; dressler et al .",
    "whilst e+a galaxies are prevalent in intermediate - redshift clusters ( e.g.  tran et al .  2003 ) , they only constitute about 1 per cent of the members of nearby clusters ( fabricant , mcclintock & bautz 1991 ) . as a fraction of the overall zero - redshift galaxy population ,",
    "e+a objects comprise significantly less than 1 per cent ( zabludoff et al .",
    "this rarity has rendered environmentally - unbiased studies of low - redshift e+a galaxies in statistically significant numbers difficult until the recent advent of large - scale galaxy surveys .",
    "the first such study was that of zabludoff et al .",
    "( 1996 ) who identified 21 low - redshift ( @xmath8 ) e+a systems from 11113 galaxies in the las campanas redshift survey .",
    "interestingly , 75 per cent of these objects were located in the field , well outside the rich clusters in which e+a galaxies were originally studied , implying that a cluster - specific mechanism is not essential for e+a galaxy formation . furthermore , the ground - based morphologies of these galaxies showed evidence for tidal features in 5 out of the 21 cases , implicating galaxy - galaxy mergers or interactions as a formation mechanism .",
    "hst imaging ( yang et al .",
    "2004 ) later strengthed these hints by revealing the detailed morphological picture of a gas - rich merger .",
    "the zabludoff et al .",
    "sample was also investigated via spatially - resolved spectroscopy ( norton et al .",
    "2001 ) , probing the kinematics of the component stellar populations , and providing further evidence that e+a galaxies in the field represent a transitional phase between disk - dominated , rotationally - supported systems and spheroid - dominated , pressure - supported galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we extend the study of zabludoff et al .",
    "( 1996 ) by selecting a low - redshift e+a sample from the 221000 galaxy spectra which form part of the final data release of the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .  2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "we use two different selection techniques , the first based on three balmer absorption lines ( h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 ) and the second utilizing solely the h@xmath1 line .",
    "these two methods yield samples of 56 and 243 galaxies respectively . the significantly increased size of these catalogues ( with respect to zabludoff et al .",
    ") allows us to measure statistical properties of the e+a galaxy population , such as the luminosity function and the clustering properties , and provides a wider database for exploring morphologies .",

    "we compare our results to this work where possible .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section [ secsamp ] we describe the selection of our 2dfgrs e+a galaxy samples , compare the selected populations to theoretical tracks in the [ colour , ew(h@xmath1)]plane , and use h@xmath6 emission to test for any ongoing but obscured star formation .",

    "we selected e+a galaxies from the final data release of the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , a major spectroscopic survey of about 221000 galaxies undertaken using the 2df facility at the anglo - australian observatory .",
    "the 2dfgrs covers an area of approximately 1500 deg@xmath12 in three regions : an north galactic pole ( ngp ) strip , a south galactic pole ( sgp ) strip and a series of random fields scattered around the sgp strip .",
    "the 2dfgrs input catalogue was selected in the photographic @xmath13 band from the automatic plate measuring facility ( apm ) galaxy survey ( and its subsequent extensions ) , with a nominal extinction - corrected magnitude limit @xmath14 .",
    "the survey spectra were obtained through 2-arcsecond fibres and cover the wavelength range @xmath15 at a resolution of @xmath16 .",
    "this wide wavelength range is made possible by the use of an atmospheric dispersion compensator ( adc ) within the 2df instrument .",

    "we briefly summarize the generation of the spectral line catalogue ; for full details see lewis et al .",
    "after removal of the continuum by subtracting the median over windows of width @xmath20 , lewis et al .  fitted up to twenty absorption or emission lines , corresponding to standard galaxy spectral features .",
    "the line profiles were assumed to be gaussian , parameterized by an amplitude and width .",
    "the wavelength spacings of the line centres were fixed at their known laboratory values , with a variable overall offset to accommodate redshifting .",
    "the quality of each line fit was classified by a flag determined by the rms residuals , ranging from 0 ( bad fit ) to 5 ( good fit ) , and a signal - to - noise parameter was computed for each line ( relative to the continuum ) . where possible , equivalent widths were then deduced using the fitted line flux and the value of the continuum flux in the local @xmath20 window .",
    "this does not require absolute flux calibration of the spectra , although we must assume that there is no significant additive error in the continuum due to effects such as scattered light .",
    "we corrected all equivalent widths for cosmological effects by dividing by a factor @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the galaxy redshift .",
    "galaxies exhibit a continuum of properties and thus the choice of selection criteria for a specific sub - class is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "zabludoff et al .  (",
    "1996 ) performed the first environmentally - unbiased selection of e+a galaxies , obtained from the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) .",
    "their sample was defined by requiring the equivalent width of [ oii ] @xmath4 emission to be less than @xmath23 , and the average of the equivalent widths of the balmer lines h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 to exceed @xmath24 in absorption .",
    "these criteria are strict , selecting an extreme class of objects corresponding to 0.2 per cent ( 21/11113 ) of lcrs galaxies .",
    "zabludoff et al .  only considered spectra possessing a signal - to - noise ratio exceeding @xmath25 in the continua about the h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 lines .",
    "we based our e+a galaxy sample selection criteria on those of zabludoff et al . , but with several adjustments .",
    "firstly , the 2dfgrs line fits catalogue ( section [ seclinefit ] ) parameterizes the quality of the fit to each spectral line using a different method to that of zabludoff et al . ; thus we can not employ an identical selection criterion as regards signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in our analysis we considered an equivalent width measurement to be reliable if the signal - to - noise parameter of the line exceeded @xmath26 and the flag parameter of the line was equal to 4 or 5 ( these flags are classified as a ` good ' fit ) .",
    "note that a ` signal - to - noise parameter ' equal to @xmath26 is in fact a high - quality detection : this parameter is defined as the mean signal - to - noise ratio of the resolution elements of the line , averaged over three line - widths .",
    "the choice of a minimum value of @xmath26 is fairly arbitrary , but serves to select an extreme class of galaxies as required .",
    "furthermore , rather than using the average of balmer equivalent widths , we introduced a weighting scheme .",
    "the relative equivalent widths of the balmer absorption lines ( h@xmath5 ) in a given galaxy spectrum are determined partly by fundamental atomic physics and are hence expected to display some level of correlation .",
    "we fitted empirical linear relations to the distributions of ( h@xmath2,h@xmath1 ) and ( h@xmath3,h@xmath1 ) equivalent widths for objects with reliable measurements of these lines in absorption ( see fig .",
    "[ fighghd ] for more details of our fitting procedure ) .",
    "we thereby derived empirical best - fitting correlations : @xmath27 @xmath28 where all equivalent widths are measured in @xmath29 in absorption .",
    "we used these linear fitting formulae to convert h@xmath3 and h@xmath2 equivalent widths to ` effective ' h@xmath1 values . for each spectrum we averaged these values for the h@xmath5 absorption lines .",
    "[ fighghd ] displays the scatter plot for the case of ( h@xmath2,h@xmath1 ) .",
    "we selected catalogues of e+a galaxies using two different methods ; this allowed us to ascertain the effects of the selection criteria on the properties of the sample .",
    "the first selection method was based on the average of the weighted balmer ` effective h@xmath1 ' equivalent widths described above , the value of which was required to exceed @xmath30 in absorption .",
    "the second selection was based solely on the h@xmath1 equivalent width , which was required to exceed @xmath24 .",
    "we emphasize again that as there is no sign of bimodality in the sample , the choice of the value @xmath24 is fairly arbitrary .",
    "all e+a objects were required to have no detection of [ oii ] @xmath4 emission .",
    "non - detection was defined either by an [ oii ] flag parameter equal to zero , or by a flag parameter @xmath31 and an [ oii ] equivalent width less than @xmath23 in emission .    in more detail : the catalogue of 2dfgrs spectral line fits compiled by lewis et al .",

    "we next required that there was little or no detectable [ oii ] @xmath4 line emission , defined by either    * flag parameter of [ oii ] @xmath36    or    * flag parameter of [ oii ] @xmath37 * equivalent width of [ oii ] @xmath4 emission @xmath38    this requirement was satisfied by 66422 galaxies .",
    "for the first of our two e+a galaxy catalogues , we made the selection for balmer absorption based on the h@xmath5 lines :    * signal - to - noise parameter of each of h@xmath39 * flag parameter of each of h@xmath40 * the average ` effective h@xmath1 ' equivalent width ( where h@xmath41 equivalent widths are weighted by the fitted conversion factors ) @xmath42 in absorption    this produced a final sample of 56 galaxies ( 0.03 per cent of high - quality galaxy spectra ) .",

    "we note that the h@xmath3 line is fitted with both an emission and an absorption gaussian component in the spectral line catalogue .",

    "we note that this sample contains 36 of the 56 average - balmer catalogue members .",
    "[ figepahdspec ] plots the first ten 2dfgrs spectra from this catalogue .",

    "interestingly , a significant fraction of spectra ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) contain h@xmath6 emission indicative of ongoing star formation , even though no measurement of [ oii ] @xmath4 was possible .",
    "we discuss this issue further in section [ sechalpha ] .",

    "it is of note that a small number of observed galaxies in fig.[figepacol ] ( viz .",
    ", the reddest e+a galaxies with the strongest h@xmath1 absorption ) can not be accounted for by the model tracks through reasonable variations in the starburst pattern or in the dust model . for example , the reddest average - balmer e+a galaxy possesses colour @xmath76 and line - strength index @xmath77 ( although those line - strength measurements exceeding @xmath78 for some h@xmath1-selected galaxies have associated errors ranging up to @xmath79 ) .",
    "this difficulty that the starburst models have in reproducing the colours and h@xmath1 equivalent widths of some ` red h@xmath1-strong ' galaxies was first recognised by couch & sharples ( 1987 ) in their study of distant clusters , and to this day the explanation has remained an unsolved puzzle .",
    "the only viable possibilities in this context would seem to be very heavy dust extinction and/or an unusual stellar initial mass function ( shioya , bekki & couch 2004 ) .      in some cases , ongoing star formation in e+a galaxies",
    "may be hidden by dust obscuration .",

    "furthermore , just 1 out of 5 of these objects yielded a detection of neutral hydrogen gas via 21 cm emission ( chang et al.2001 ; the non - detected systems have upper limits of neutral hydrogen content of @xmath80 ) .",
    "the presence of neutral hydrogen would indicate the existence of a gas reservoir that may fuel ongoing or future star formation ( and the large - scale spatial distribution and kinematics of this gas can encode information about any merger event ) .",
    "this evidence suggests that low - redshift e+a galaxies are predominantly not undergoing dust - enshrouded star formation .    in order to test this assertion further , for each e+a galaxy spectrum in our 2dfgrs samples we inspected the equivalent width of h@xmath6 emission , which is less sensitive to extinction by dust than [ oii ] @xmath4 emission . for the purpose of this section ,",
    "we assume that any h@xmath6 emission is caused by star formation activity , although we note that the presence of an agn is an alternative explanation and more detailed consideration of spectral line ratios is required to distinguish between these two cases ( e.g.  kauffmann et al .",

    "<S> we quantify the local environments , clustering properties and luminosity function of the e+a galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the environments are consistent with the ensemble of 2dfgrs galaxies : low - redshift e+a systems are located predominantly in the field , existing as isolated objects or in poor groups . </S>",
    "<S> however , the luminosity distribution of galaxies selected using three balmer absorption lines h@xmath5 appears more typical of ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , morphologically these galaxies are preferentially spheroidal ( e / s0 ) systems . in a small but significant number </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for recent major mergers , such as tidal tails . </S>",
    "<S> we infer that major mergers are one important formation mechanism for e+a galaxies , as suggested by previous studies . at low redshift </S>",
    "<S> the merger probability is high in the field and low in clusters , thus these recently - formed spheroidal systems do not follow the usual morphology - density relation for ellipticals .    </S>",
    "<S> regarding the selection of e+a galaxies : we find that basing the balmer - line criterion solely on h@xmath1 absorption leads to a significant sub - population of disk systems with detectable h@xmath6 emission . in these objects </S>",
    "<S> the [ oii ] emission is presumably either obscured by dust or present with a low signal - to - noise ratio , whilst the ( h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 ) absorption features are subject to emission - filling .    </S>",
