    "lattice simulations of dense matter are important for the understanding of future heavy ion collider experiments as well as the equation of state of neutron stars @xcite@xcite . the main obstacle to the numerical evaluation of qcd in this regime",
    "is that the lattice action becomes complex with the inclusion of the chemical potential @xmath0 , prohibiting naive probabilistic monte carlo methods .",
    "recent attempts to evaluate qcd at finite baryon density have involved evaluating canonical ensembles with a given number of background quark sources @xcite@xcite , and the evaluation of qcd - like models in which the lattice action is real at finite @xmath0 @xcite@xcite .",
    "an earlier reweighting approach was developed at glasgow , in which the grand canonical partition function is evaluated semi - analytically .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the lattice action is made analytic in the glasgow reweighting method through the formulation of a characteristic polynomial in the fugacity variable @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the fermion matrix @xmath2 ( defined with kogut - susskind fermions @xcite ) is re - expressed in terms of the matrices which contain only links between lattice sites in the spatial directions @xmath3 , and forward and backward in the time direction @xmath4 and @xmath5 . which allows the definition of the propagator matrix @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xmath7    @xmath8    the propagator matrix is then used to re - express @xmath9 as a characteristic polynomial in the variable @xmath10 ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the lattice volume , @xmath13 the number of colours , and the expansion coefficients @xmath14 , so defined , are functionals of the lattice gauge fields . since @xmath4 is an overall factor of @xmath6 the expansion can be further simplified through the symmetry @xmath15 associated with performing a unitary transformation on @xmath6 by multiplying the timelinks by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an integer .",
    "this then allows relation of the expansion coefficients of the characteristic polynomial ( where @xmath18 ) to the canonical partition functions @xmath19 and the grand canonical partition function @xmath20 . as lee and",
    "yang showed with an ising ferromagnetic system , in the thermodynamic limit a phase transition occurs wherever a zero of the fugacity polynomial approaches the real axis in the complex-@xmath21 plane @xcite .",
    "the zeros @xmath22 are determined numerically by rootfinding the reweighted polynomial expansion coefficients .",
    "@xmath23    reweighting introduces normalisation by the ensemble generated at @xmath24 into eqn.([norm ] ) , which leaves the analytic determination of the critical points unaffected .",
    "the advantage of the scheme is that , even though the fermionic action is in general complex in su(3 ) , an ensemble can be generated at @xmath25 .",
    "however , it has been shown that the unphysical onset transition at @xmath26 of quenched measurements @xcite , persists despite the inclusion of dynamical quarks .",
    "from which it is concluded that the monte carlo sampling is ineffective , because the @xmath25 ensemble has little overlap with the physically relevant region @xcite@xcite .",
    "parallels can also be drawn between this pathology and the sign problem of the related reweighting of the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "for su(2 ) we can vary the value of @xmath24 we use to generate ensembles ( as the group is pseudoreal for quarks in the fundamental representation @xcite ) .",
    "this then allowed us to investigate the reliability of the ensemble - averaging of the polynomial expansion coefficients of eqn.([cn ] ) , which is defined through the fugacity expansion .",

    "where the ratio on the lefthand side of eqn.([aver ] ) differs from one , we found from our measurements that the reliability of the ensemble - averaging is strongly affected . in turn",
    "this affected our determination of the lee yang zeros through rootfinding , and our measurement of related thermodynamic observables evaluated from the expansion coefficients .",
    "we monitored the effect by measuring the ratio @xmath33 , of the expansion coefficients from ensembles generated at two different values of @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath34    although this ratio should be independent of @xmath35 , our measurements indicate that ensemble - averaging selectively affects the determination of the expansion .",
    "only a small range of @xmath35 can be reliably determined from an ensemble generated at a given value of @xmath24 . however , since this small range centers on different @xmath35 as @xmath24 is varied , coefficients from a covering of several ensembles ( generated at different values of @xmath24 ) can be combined to alleviate the bias inherent in the reweighting . the reliably ensemble - averaged range of coefficients from the ensemble generated at @xmath36 ( multiplied by @xmath37 )",
    "is used to replace the corresponding range of the expansion of the ensemble generated at @xmath38 . as the number of covering ensembles",
    "is increased these new composite reweighted coefficients , which replace the ill - determined coefficients , thus converge to accurate values .",
    "measurements of the chiral @xmath39 and diquark condensates @xmath40 at strong @xcite and intermediate coupling @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , indicate at least two distinct finite density regimes .",
    "the first , a low density vacuum regime in which @xmath41 @xmath42 , is believed to be separated from a thermodynamic regime , where @xmath43 @xmath44 , by a transition at @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath45 symmetry at @xmath46 allows a rotation between the two condensates and so the superfluid diquark can be used as an indicator of the spontaneous breaking of the staggered fermion chiral symmetry remnant @xmath47 ( in addition to @xmath48 ) .",
    "our measurements of the zeros of the grand canonical partition function identify this transition as we tabulate in table 1 . by evaluating the lee yang zeros @xmath22 in the complex @xmath0 plane we can readily identify the value of @xmath0 at the transition . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath49 and",
    "so @xmath50 corresponds to @xmath51 . @xmath52",
    "before our composite reweighting procedure is applied , @xmath28 is inconsistent and strongly dependent on the value of @xmath24 used in the reweighting .",
    "however the jacknife error estimates with our new scheme indicate that the zeros can be consistently determined where we alleviate the inaccuracies caused by reweighting .",
    "as we increase the number of ensembles generated at succesive values of @xmath24 used to cover the expansion , @xmath50 becomes consistent .",
    "also @xmath49 , from which we are able to more confidently associate @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "our measurements at @xmath53 on a @xmath54 lattice indicate a transition at @xmath55 , which is in approximate agreement with existing measurements @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the prominent peaking of our further measurements of the quark number density susceptibility from the composite weighted expansion coefficients , we believe , indicates that this transition is first order .",
    "having developed our new approach in su(2 ) , we now evaluate the ensemble - averaged polynomial expansion coefficients of static su(3 ) @xcite , from canonical ensembles generated with different numbers of background quark sources . in this way we are able to again systematically vary the localised region in which the ensemble - averaging is reliable , and combine coefficients from different ensembles .",
    "@xmath56    our implementation of static su(3 ) involves setting @xmath57 in eqn.([p ] ) which differs slightly from existing schemes @xcite@xcite@xcite in that we additionally incorporate the relativistic effect of antiquarks .",
    "the motivation for choosing this model over full su(3 ) is purely the computational expediency that refreshing @xmath14 in one dimension alone affords the monte carlo sampling .",
    "although the expansion coefficients are in general complex , our measurements of the ensemble - averaged real part of the phase of our measure indicate that the sign problem of the measure is negligible , fig.(2 ) . as @xmath35 moves away from the index of the expansion coefficient used as the monte carlo measure , however , the ensemble averaging of the expansion coefficients becomes less effective , as we monitor in fig.(3 ) .",
    "for the two ensembles generated with the measures @xmath58 and @xmath59 , @xmath60 is only reliably determined for @xmath61 .",
    "elsewhere error estimates indicate that the measurement is unreliable , and so only the expansion coefficients in this small range are effectively sampled .",
    "our measurements at @xmath62 with a @xmath54 lattice volume of the zeros fig.(4 ) , and corresponding quark number density susceptibility , indicate a first order finite density transition at @xmath63 .",
    "although we have addressed the pathologies of the glasgow method with our new composite reweighting approach , the main stumbling block to the evaluation of finite density su(3 ) with dynamical fermions would appear to remain the numerical effort required to evaluate the reweighting method .",
    "we seem to have traded the overlap problem for the efficiency our evaluation of canonical ensembles , which we believe now requires parallel computing .",
    "however , rootfinders can often find the zeros of a polynomial from the first few coefficients of an expansion , which we can achieve in our method by implementing a shift variable to truncate the polynomial @xcite .",
    "further progress in evaluating su(3 ) with dynamical quarks at finite density can therefore be made by evaluating ensembles weighted with the first few expansion coefficients alone in this manner .",
