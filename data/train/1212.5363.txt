    "any estimate of the electron - hole pairing amplitude depends sensitively on the level of screening included in the model . because of the long range character of the coulomb interaction , an unscreened electron - electron interaction results in very large gaps in the spectrum , and in a high critical temperature @xcite . to go beyond this",
    ", one may incorporate screening via a dielectric function appropriate for metallic graphene , completely eliminating the effective long - range nature of the interaction .",

    "a complication of this approach is that it requires knowledge of the single - particle band structure , so that the screened interactions must be computed self - consistently with states and energies found in the hartree - fock approximation .",

    "in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation the electron - electron interaction is replaced in the hamiltonian by @xmath55 the energy of the groundstate can be lowered by opening a gap at the crossing between the electron - like band of the bonding energy states and the hole - like band of the antibonding spectrum .",

    "the two occupied bands have a bonding character and @xmath70 . for values of @xmath71 , the hole - like antibonding band and the electron - like bonding band",
    "are occupied , and @xmath72 . in these two limits",
    "@xmath73 is close to its non - interacting value , @xmath74 because the large energy differences between states in different bands allows for little admixture between them in the hf state .",
    "for values of @xmath75 , the similarity in energy of bonding and antibonding states allows them to admix and thereby lower the energy of the system .",
    "it is in this range that @xmath73 significantly differs from its non - interacting value , so that we can use this quantity as a measure of the anomalous order in the hf state .",
    "a physical picture of the ordering can be found in the language of quantum ferromagnetism .",
    "we define an isospin degree of freedom for each of the sublattices , in which spin `` up '' corresponds to an electron in the left layer , and spin `` down '' indicates an electron residing in the right layer .",
    "assuming we consider only states in which the hole - like bonding band is completely full , and the electron - like anti - bonding band is completely empty , one may easily confirm that the isospin expectation values in the hf state can be written in terms of spin vectors for each sublattice , satisfying @xmath76 note that , because of the background filled hole - like bonding band , these vectors are not constant in magnitude .",

    "one thus obtains a broken @xmath21 symmetry in the groundstate .",
    "physically , this broken symmetry manifests itself as a transfer of charge between the layers , in opposite directions for the two sublattices . a related ordering for this system",
    "has recently been suggested in a tight - binding hubbard model @xcite .",
    "were spin to be included in our model , we expect that the spontaneous orderings for opposing spin directions would be staggered , yielding the essentially the same antiferromagnetic ordering in our system that is found in the tight - binding hubbard model .",
    "we note that the very short - range interaction employed in a hubbard model implies strong screening , which is not consistent with the gap opening in the spectrum .",
    "our calculation strongly suggests that the antiferromagnetic ordering will still be present when the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction is included .",
    "in @xmath19 stacked bilayer graphene , the distance between layers is relatively small ( @xmath0=@xmath89 , with @xmath34 the graphene lattice constant . ) moreover , screening is very efficient in this system at large @xmath50 . in the range of wavevectors relevant for the formation of the condensate ( @xmath75 ) ,",
