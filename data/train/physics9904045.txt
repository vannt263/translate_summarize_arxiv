    "this is the sixth part of our eight presentations in which we consider applications of methods from wavelet analysis to nonlinear accelerator physics problems .",
    "this is a continuation of our results from [ 1]-[8 ] , in which we considered the applications of a number of analytical methods from nonlinear ( local ) fourier analysis , or wavelet analysis , to nonlinear accelerator physics problems both general and with additional structures ( hamiltonian , symplectic or quasicomplex ) , chaotic , quasiclassical , quantum .",
    "wavelet analysis is a relatively novel set of mathematical methods , which gives us a possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and with the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases .",
    "in contrast with parts 14 in parts 58 we try to take into account before using power analytical approaches underlying algebraical , geometrical , topological structures related to kinematical , dynamical and hidden symmetry of physical problems . in part 2 according to the orbit method and by using construction from the geometric quantization theory we construct the symplectic and poisson structures associated with generalized wavelets by using metaplectic structure . in part 3 we consider applications of very useful fast wavelet transform technique ( fwt ) ( part 4 ) to calculations in quasiclassical evolution dynamics .",
    "this method gives maximally sparse representation of ( differential ) operator that allows us to take into account contribution from each level of resolution .",
    "let @xmath0 be symplectic group , @xmath1 be its unique two- fold covering ",
    "metaplectic group [ 9 ] .",
    "let v be a symplectic vector space with symplectic form ( , ) , then @xmath2 is nilpotent lie algebra - heisenberg algebra : @xmath3=0 , \\ [ v , w]=(v , w)\\in r,\\   [ v , v]=r$ ] .",
    "@xmath4 is a group of automorphisms of heisenberg algebra .",
    "let n be a group with lie algebra @xmath5 , i.e. heisenberg group .",
    "by stone von neumann theorem heisenberg group has unique irreducible unitary representation in which @xmath6 .",
    "let us also consider the projective representation of symplectic group @xmath4 : @xmath7 , where c is a map : @xmath8 , i.e. c is @xmath9-cocycle .",
    "but this representation is unitary representation of universal covering , i.e. metaplectic group @xmath10 .",
    "we give this representation without stone - von neumann theorem.consider a new group @xmath11 is semidirect product ( we consider instead of @xmath12 the @xmath13 ) .",
    "let @xmath14 be dual to v , @xmath15 be automorphism group of @xmath14.then f is subgroup of @xmath16 , which consists of elements , which acts on @xmath14 by affine transformations .",
    "this is the key point !",
    "let @xmath17 be symplectic basis in v , @xmath18 and @xmath19 be symplectic form on @xmath14 .",
    "let m be fixed affine polarization , then for @xmath20 the map @xmath21 gives unitary representation of g : @xmath22 .",
    "explicitly we have for representation of n on h(m ) : @xmath23 the representation of n on h(m ) is irreducible .",
    "let @xmath24 be infinitesimal operators of this representation @xmath25 , \\quad   a_p=\\lim_{t\\rightarrow 0 } \\frac{1}{t}[\\theta_{-tp}-i],\\ ] ] @xmath26 now we give the representation of infinitesimal basic elements . lie algebra of the group f",
    "is the algebra of all ( nonhomogeneous ) quadratic polynomials of ( p , q ) relatively poisson bracket ( pb ) .",
    "the basis of this algebra consists of elements @xmath27 ,   @xmath28 ,  @xmath29 ,  @xmath30 , @xmath31 so , we have the representation of basic elements @xmath32 , @xmath33 this gives the structure of the poisson manifolds to representation of any ( nilpotent ) algebra or in other words to continuous wavelet transform .",
    "according to this approach we can construct by using methods of geometric quantization theory many `` symplectic wavelet constructions '' with corresponding symplectic or poisson structure on it .",
    "then we may produce symplectic invariant wavelet calculations for pb or commutators which we may use in quantization procedure or in chaotic dynamics ( part 8) via operator representation from section 4 .",
    "let us consider classical and quantum dynamics in phase space @xmath34 with coordinates @xmath35 and generated by hamiltonian @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 is ( classical ) flow then time evolution of any bounded classical observable or symbol @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the self - adjoint operators or quantum observables in @xmath42 , representing the weyl quantization of the symbols @xmath43 [ 9 ] @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 be the heisenberg observable or quantum evolution of the observable @xmath47 under unitary group generated by @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 solves the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath50.$ ] let @xmath51 is a symbol of @xmath49 then we have the following equation for it @xmath52 with the initial condition @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the moyal brackets of the observables @xmath55 , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the symbol of the operator product and is presented by the composition of the symbols @xmath58 @xmath59 for our problems it is useful that @xmath60 admits the formal expansion in powers of @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a multi - index , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "so , evolution ( 1 ) for symbol @xmath51 is @xmath66    at @xmath67 this equation transforms to classical liouville equation @xmath68 equation ( 2 ) plays a key role in many quantum ( semiclassical ) problem .",
    "we note only the problem of relation between quantum and classical evolutions or how long the evolution of the quantum observables is determined by the corresponding classical one [ 9 ] .",
    "our approach to solution of systems ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) is based on our technique from [ 1]-[8 ] and very useful linear parametrization for differential operators which we present in the next section .",
    "let us consider multiresolution representation @xmath69 ( see our other papers from this series for details of wavelet machinery ) .",
    "let t be an operator @xmath70 , with the kernel @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath73 is projection operators on the subspace @xmath74 corresponding to j level of resolution : @xmath75 let @xmath76 is the projection operator on the subspace @xmath77 then we have the following `` microscopic or telescopic '' representation of operator t which takes into account contributions from each level of resolution from different scales starting with coarsest and ending to finest scales [ 10 ] : @xmath78 we remember that this is a result of presence of affine group inside this construction .",
    "the non - standard form of operator representation [ 10 ] is a representation of an operator t as a chain of triples @xmath79 , acting on the subspaces @xmath74 and @xmath77 : @xmath80 where operators @xmath81 are defined as @xmath82 the operator @xmath83 admits a recursive definition via @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 works on @xmath87 .",
    "it should be noted that operator @xmath88 describes interaction on the scale @xmath89 independently from other scales , operators @xmath90 describe interaction between the scale j and all coarser scales , the operator @xmath86 is an `` averaged '' version of @xmath91 .",
    "the operators @xmath92 are represented by matrices @xmath93 @xmath94 we may compute the non - standard representations of operator @xmath95 in the wavelet bases by solving a small system of linear algebraical equations .",
    "so , we have for objects ( 4 ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 then by using refinement equations we have in terms of filters @xmath98 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 therefore , the representation of @xmath101 is completely determined by the coefficients @xmath102 or by representation of @xmath101 only on the subspace @xmath103 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath104 satisfy the following system of linear algebraical equations @xmath105\\ ] ] and @xmath106 , where @xmath107 @xmath108 , @xmath109 are the autocorrelation coefficients of the filter @xmath48 . if a number of vanishing moments @xmath110 then this linear system of equations has a unique solution with finite number of non - zero @xmath102 , @xmath111 for @xmath112 . for the representation of operator @xmath113 we have the similar reduced linear system of equations",
    ". then finally we have for action of operator @xmath114 on sufficiently smooth function @xmath115 : @xmath116 where @xmath117 is wavelet basis and @xmath118 are wavelet coefficients .",
    "so , we have simple linear parametrization of matrix representation of our differential operator in wavelet basis and of the action of this operator on arbitrary vector in our functional space .",
    "then we may use such representation in all preceding sections .",
