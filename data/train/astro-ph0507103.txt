    "one of the main objectives of the pierre auger observatory @xcite is the measurement of the flux of cosmic rays above 10@xmath0 ev .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the aperture is an important piece of this measurement , in particular in its different detection configurations : sd - only , fd - only and hybrid . for this purpose",
    "it is mandatory to use a detailed simulation to exploit dependences on the numerous parameters .    the detector aperture , integrated over solid angle , is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the differential and total solid angles respectively .",
    "excluding inclined showers , @xmath4 varies from 0 to @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the effective area , @xmath7 is the overall trigger efficiency and @xmath8 is the reconstruction efficiency . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the differential and total areas where shower events hit ground level . equation ( [ apert ] ) allows the calculation of aperture for different conditions and detector configurations .",
    "single detector ( sd or fd ) apertures are obtained using the relevant detector efficiency functions for @xmath7 and @xmath8 . on the other hand , a hybrid aperture calculation has to include efficiencies of both detectors and therefore each efficiency function has to be read in ( [ apert ] ) as the product @xmath11 .",
    "under the assumption that all six telescopes forming an fd eye have identical characteristics one can restrict the generation area to a slice with a vertex at a telescope , radius from 0 up to a maximum distance and azimuthal width equal to the telescope field of view ( i.e. @xmath12 around the telescope axis ) .",
    "efficiency is calculated as a function of polar coordinates of shower impact points .",
    "because of left - right symmetry , efficiency is a function of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the absolute azimuthal distance of the impact point from the telescope axis azimuth .",
    "the assumption of identical telescopes is needed to extend the evaluation of @xmath15 for @xmath16 , using the efficiency measured by the neighbouring telescopes .",
    "the simulation fdsim @xcite was used for generating showers from two primary types , protons and iron nuclei , in 8 energy bins from 10@xmath17 to 10@xmath18 ev .",
    "two different atmospheres were used with vertical aerosol optical depth ( vaod ) above the fd level of 0.03 and 0.06 , respectively .",
    "these atmospheres will be referred to as `` clean '' and `` dirty '' , having respectively lower and higher vaod with respect to the typical malarge atmosphere@xcite .    in total 700,000 shower profiles",
    "have been generated .",
    "trigger efficiency has been calculated in cells of @xmath19 km times @xmath20 for four separate cases : protons and iron nuclei in `` clean '' and `` dirty '' atmospheres .",
    "the basic trigger function @xmath15 has been regularized and parameterised , at each energy , through a fit to an empirical function .    during the current period of data",
    "taking only some telescopes are fully equipped with a corrector ring ( an optical device for increasing aperture ) @xcite . therefore , for a selected configuration of primary and atmosphere ( protons in `` clean '' atmosphere ) , we simulated 20,000 shower profiles with this optics , to study the differences between telescopes with or without a corrector ring .",
    "using the basic trigger function discussed in the previous section it is straightforward to evaluate the efficiency @xmath21 to trigger a shower by _ at least one telescope in the eye_.   this function is mapped onto the ground . for this purpose",
    "the ground area is divided into a grid of 0.5 @xmath22 0.5 km@xmath23 cells and the corresponding polar coordinates @xmath24 relative to each eye is calculated .",
    "this allows the evaluation of @xmath21 at the cell center as seen by each eye for the different detection configurations , i.e.  _ mono _ , _ stereo _ , _ 3-fd _ or _",
    "4-fd_. the corresponding aperture follows directly from the surface integral in eq .",
    "( [ apert ] ) .",
    "the integral has been performed over a domain fully including the sd array in its final extension and assuming @xmath25 within the array boundary and 0 outside .",
    "this represents the _ effective hybrid area in the ideal case of a fully efficient sd at any energy_. since a hybrid trigger requires only a sd single station trigger ( sd - t1)@xcite , this condition turns out to be fulfilled as soon as the energy exceeds 10@xmath0 ev .",
    "then the aperture is @xmath26 where the bar signs stand for the average over solid angle , with a @xmath27 @xmath28 distribution .",
    "p.45 p.45   , title=\"fig : \" ]    &   , title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .",
    "[ hyb ] the aperture calculated for different fd configurations is shown .",
    "the mono - hybrid aperture is practically independent of primary type , but is slightly sensitive to atmosphere parameters .",
    "the relative difference between the two atmospheres is about 15% at @xmath29 ev and vanishes at higher energies . for more demanding",
    "detection configurations ( stereo , 3-fd and 4-fd ) , apertures tend to be more sensitive to both composition and atmosphere .",
    "apertures shown in fig .",
    "[ hyb ] are trigger apertures . since the only requirement applied to showers",
    "is the fullfillment of trigger conditions .",
    "other conditions have to be applied if showers are to be reconstructed . in fig . [ rec ]",
    "we show how the aperture changes when the shower detector plane ( sdp ) ( _ geometry level _ ) and the shower profile ( _ profile level _ ) are reconstructed . in this figure ,",
    "sdp reconstruction was assumed to be fulfilled with at least 5 pixels .",
    "the profile level requires a minimum number of 10 pixels and the shower maximum in the telescope field of view .",
    "the aperture shown so far is based on fd efficiency only and for the full auger site as the generation area . however the auger detector is not static , but is continually changing : at present , since new tanks are added and put into operation and , at completion , since individual detectors ( sd tanks and/or fd telescopes ) can be occasionally out of operation or excluded because of non standard performance .",
    "therefore the actual hybrid aperture in the construction phase and also in the final configuration has to be calculated using both fd and sd trigger responses .",
    "the sd trigger efficiency has been extensively studied separately and in particular the use of a `` lateral trigger probability '' ( ltp ) function has been proposed @xcite for a complete description of the trigger features .",
    "these ltp functions have been parameterised as a function of distance at various energies .",
    "because in the current phase of data taking fd telescopes have different optical configurations ( with and without corrector ring ) , the basic trigger functions were calculated accordingly . as shown in fig [ crnocr ]",
    ", the configuration with corrector ring allows more distant viewing at any angle .    in fig .",
    "[ hmono ] the mono hybrid trigger efficiency is shown as a function of energy , for the site configuration of mid october 2004 . at lower energies",
    "the mono hybrid trigger accesses only the area covered by sd tanks just in front of each eye .",
    "in particular at @xmath30 ev the single tank are easily visible as red spots in the trigger patterns . at higher energies ,",
    "when the ltp range exceeds the distance between contiguous tanks , the area accessed by the hybrid trigger is roughly the intersection of fd patterns with sd domain .",
    "p.45 p.50     &     in fig .",
    "[ aeffnow ] the hybrid trigger aperture is shown as a function of energy for mono and stereo detection as compared with sd - t1 detection ( sd - only single station trigger efficiency ) .",
    "it can be seen that mono detection approaches sd - t1 as energy increases .",
    "stereo detection becomes sizable above @xmath31 ev and then rapidly increases .",
    "the use of basic trigger functions for both sd and fd detectors allows a detailed study of the local trigger probability and aperture in the case of hybrid detection .",
    "this approach is particularly appealing since it limits the intensive cpu simulation to the generation of these functions , that can then be used very easily for aperture calculations .",
    "the advantage is still more evident if one takes into account that simulation studies are largely detector specific .",
    "finally we have shown that this approach allows the continuous evaluation of apertures as new detectors are added in the field and put into operation .    99 j. abraham",
