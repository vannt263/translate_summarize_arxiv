    "the relay channel , and its gaussian version in particular , models the communication scenario where a wireless link is assisted by a single relay . motivated by the need to increase the spectral efficiency of wireless systems , characterizing the capacity of the gaussian relay channel has been one of the central problems in information theory over the past couple of decades .",
    "the single relay channel has been introduced by van der meulen in @xcite and the seminal work of cover and el gamal in 1979 @xcite has developed two basic achievability schemes for this setup , namely decode - and - forward and compress - and - forward , as well as an upper bound on its capacity , now known as the cut - set bound . over the following 35 years",
    ", many new relaying strategies have been discovered such as amplify - and - forward , hash - and - forward , quantize - map - and - forward , compute - and - forward @xcite etc .",
    ", however the cut - set bound has remained as the only upper bound on the capacity of the gaussian relay channel . to our knowledge , it is not even known if the cut - set bound is tight or not for this channel .    in this paper , we make progress on this problem by developing a new upper bound on the capacity of the gaussian primitive relay channel .",
    "this is a special case of the gaussian single relay channel where the multiple access channel from the source and the relay to the destination has orthogonal components @xcite .",
    "see figure  [ f : gaussianrelay ] . here",
    ", the relay can be thought of as communicating to the destination over a gaussian channel in a separate frequency band , or equivalently the destination can be thought of as equipped with two receive antennas , one directed to the source and one directed to the relay with no interference in between .",
    "can be equivalently thought of as a gaussian channel of the same capacity @xcite . ]",
    "our upper bound is tighter than the cut - set bound for this channel for all channel parameters .",
    "while this result is developed in the single - relay setting , it has implications also for gaussian networks with multiple relays . in particular , combined with a simple tensorization argument recently proposed in @xcite , it implies that the linear ( in the number of nodes ) gap to the cut - set bound in current capacity approximations for gaussian relay networks is fundamental .",
    "indeed , the true capacity of gaussian relay networks can have linear gap to the cut - set bound and our result can be used to obtain a lower bound on the pre - constant .",
    "our upper bound builds on the approach we developed in our recent work @xcite for bounding the capacity of the discrete memoryless primitive relay channel .",
    "similar to earlier bounds on the capacity of the discrete memoryless primitive relay channel @xcite , the bound we developed in @xcite builds on the ( generalized ) blowing - up lemma , however unlike these earlier bounds does not critically rely on the finiteness of the alphabet size , which allows us to extend it to the gaussian case in the current paper .",
    "analogous to the results for the discrete memoryless case @xcite , a key ingredient of our upper bound for the gaussian case is a gaussian measure concentration result .",
    "consider a gaussian primitive relay channel as depicted in fig . [ f : gaussianrelay ] , where @xmath0 denotes the source signal which is constrained to average power @xmath1 , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the received signals of the relay and the destination .",
    "we have    z = x+w_1 + y = x+w_2    where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are gaussian noises that are independent of each other and @xmath6 , and have zero mean and variances @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the relay can communicate to the destination via an error - free digital link of rate @xmath9 .    for this channel , a code of rate @xmath10 and blocklength @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath12 consists of the following :    1 .",
    "a codebook at the source @xmath6 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 2 .",
    "an encoding function at the relay @xmath15 , @xmath16 3 .",
    "a decoding function at the destination @xmath17 , @xmath18    the average probability of error of the code is defined as @xmath19 where the message @xmath20 is assumed to be uniformly drawn from the message set @xmath21 .",
    "a rate @xmath10 is said to be achievable if there exists a sequence of codes @xmath22 such that the average probability of error @xmath23 as @xmath24 .",
    "the capacity of the primitive relay channel is the supremum of all achievable rates , denoted by @xmath25 .      for the gaussian primitive relay channel ,",
    "the cut - set bound can be stated as follows .",
    "[ p : cutset ] for the gaussian primitive relay channel , if a rate @xmath10 is achievable , then there exists a random variable @xmath6 satisfying @xmath26\\leq p$ ] such that    r i(x;y , z)[e : cut1 ] + r i(x;y)+r_0 [ e : cut2 ] .",
    "it can be easily shown that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 in proposition [ p : cutset ] are maximized when @xmath29 , leading us to the following corollary .",
    "[ c : cutset ] for the gaussian primitive relay channel , if a rate @xmath10 is achievable , then    r ( 1++ ) + r ( 1+)+r_0 .",
    "to simplify the exposition , in this paper we only concentrate on the symmetric case of the gaussian primitive relay channel , that is , when @xmath30 .",
    "our results can be extended to the asymmetric case by using channel simulation arguments .",
    "we defer this extension to the longer version of the paper .",
    "the following theorem states the main result of this paper .",
    "[ t : newboundsym ] for the symmetric gaussian primitive relay channel , if a rate @xmath10 is achievable , then there exists a random variable @xmath6 satisfying @xmath26\\leq p$ ] and some @xmath31 $ ] such that    r i(x;y , z)[e : symnew1 ] + r i(x;y)+r_0 -a [ e : symnew2 ] + r i(x;y)+a+e .",
    "[ e : symnew3 ]    as in the case of the cut - set bound , since both @xmath27 and @xmath28 in theorem [ t : newboundsym ] are maximized when @xmath29 , we have the following corollary .",

    "[ e : newboundsym3 ]    note that in the symmetric case , by corollary [ c : cutset ] , the cut - set bound says that if a rate @xmath10 is achievable , then    r ( 1 + ) [ e : cutsetsym1 ] + r ( 1+)+r_0.[e : cutsetsym2 ]    clearly the bound on @xmath10 in corollary  [ c : newboundsym ] is tighter than the cut - set bound since will only reduce to if @xmath32 .",
    "however , if @xmath32 then will constrain the rate @xmath10 by the capacity of the source - destination link .",
    "the constraint on @xmath10 , jointly imposed by and can be found by equating them to yield @xmath33 corollary  [ c : newboundsym ] can be restated in terms of @xmath34 as follows : if a rate @xmath10 is achievable , then    r",
    "( 1 + ) + r ( 1+)+r_0-a^*.    note that both the cut - set bound and our new bound depend on the channel parameters through @xmath35 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate the largest gap between these two bounds over all parameter values for the symmetric gaussian primitive relay channel . for this",
    ", it can be shown that when @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the gap takes its largest value and is given by the solution of equation , which is @xmath38 .",
    "we formally summarize this observation in the following proposition .",
    "[ p : largestpossible ] let @xmath39 denote the gap between the two bounds and @xmath40 its largest possible value over all symmetric gaussian primitive relay channels , i.e. , @xmath41 then , @xmath42 .",
    "while the setup we consider in this paper can be regarded as a special case of a gaussian relay network , the upper bound we develop for this special case can be used to infer how tightly the capacity of general gaussian relay networks can be approximated by the cut - set bound .",
    "initiated by the work of avestimehr , diggavi and tse @xcite , there has been significant recent interest @xcite in approximating the capacity of general gaussian relay networks with the cut - set bound , i.e. bounding the gap between the rates achieved by specific schemes and the cut - set bound on capacity .",
    "the gap in these approximation results is linear in the number of nodes in the network but independent of the channel snrs and network topology .",
    "in particular , the best currently known approximation result @xcite has a gap of @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total number of nodes .",
    "while some recent works @xcite demonstrate sublinear in the number of nodes ( or in the total number of antennas in the case of multiple antenna nodes ) gap to the cut - set bound for specific topologies , a recent tensorization argument proposed in @xcite shows that the gap between the capacity and the cut - set bound can be bounded by a sublinear function of the number of nodes , independent of network topology and channel configurations , if , and only if , capacity is equal to the cut - set bound for _ all _ gaussian relay networks .",
    "moreover , theorem  3 of @xcite implies that an explicit gap to the cut - set bound for any specific network with specific channel parameters and topology would imply a lower bound on the preconstant in these approximation results . in particular , the gap @xmath45 in proposition  [ p : largestpossible ] for the gaussian primitive relay channel ( which can be thought of as a gaussian network with two receive antennas at the destination , so four antennas in total ) implies that the capacity of gaussian relay networks can not be approximated by the cutset bound , independent of the topology and channel coefficients , with a gap that is smaller than @xmath46 .",
    "in this section , we prove bounds  sequentially with the focus on showing .",
    "suppose a rate @xmath10 is achievable .",

    "in the sequel we will prove a third inequality involving @xmath59 , which will force @xmath59 to be strictly larger than @xmath62 .",
    "indeed , it is intuitively easy to see that @xmath59 can not be arbitrarily small .",
    "assume @xmath63 .",
    "roughly speaking , this implies that given the transmitted codeword @xmath64 , there is no ambiguity about @xmath65 , or equivalently all @xmath66 sequences jointly typical with @xmath64 are mapped to the same @xmath65 .",
    "see figure  [ f : typicalset ] .",
    "however , since @xmath67 and @xmath66 are statistically equivalent given @xmath64 ( they share the same typical set given @xmath64 ) this would imply that @xmath65 can be determined based on @xmath67 and therefore the transmitted codeword @xmath64 can be decoded based solely on @xmath67 .",
    "this will force the rate to be smaller than @xmath68 .",
    "in general , there is a trade - off between how close the rate can get to the multiple access bound @xmath69 and how much it can exceed the point - to - point capacity @xmath68 of the @xmath6-@xmath17 link .",
