    "advancement in the current technology of trapping and controlling single atoms cooled down to ultra low temperatures has opened new research directions in quantum optics and quantum communication .",
    "spatial configurations of linear atomic chains or two - dimensional atomic lattices have been engineered and have been widely applied in various experimental setups  @xcite .",
    "recently , the subject of utilizing super - cold atoms as highly reflecting mirrors has gained much attention .",
    "in particular , it has been demonstrated that a collection of cold atoms trapped near the surface of a one - dimensional waveguide can form a nearly perfect mirror for the radiation incident on the atoms  @xcite .",
    "the waveguide represents a photonic channel which enhances the electromagnetic field to which the atoms are coupled thereby leading to a strong collective behavior of the atoms . as a consequence , a large part of the incident light is directed , reflected back , to the medium from which it originated .",
    "this striking mirror property of atoms is in contrary to the usual observation where atoms absorb / scatter all or most of the incident energy .",
    "another kind of systems that can exhibit mirror properties or equivalently a highly directive radiative properties are atoms chirally coupled to a waveguide  @xcite .",
    "chirality in atom - waveguide coupling is an effect associated with a broken symmetry of emission of photons from the atoms into the right and left propagating modes of the waveguide . as a result ,",
    "the emitted photons are channeled into one of the two directions of the waveguide .",
    "it has been shown that the chiral property of the emission can enhance entanglement between two distant atoms  @xcite .",
    "directive radiative properties have also been demonstrated for a single atom trapped at front of a distant dielectric mirror  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that the atom can behave as an optical mirror effectively forming , together with the dielectric mirror , a fabry - prot cavity .",
    "related studies have shown that an atom mirror can not only serve as a single mirror for a one - dimensional cavity , but also could be arranged to behave like a high - finesse cavity  @xcite .    in the course of previous work on directional emission",
    "the underlying atoms independently couple to a one - dimensional field of a waveguide , or nano - cavity or a nano - fibre .",
    "although systems involving independent atoms exhibit interesting directional properties , there can be similar features created by an open system of atoms in which the atoms are coupled to a common three - dimensional field .",
    "it was dicke  @xcite who pointed out that a collection of a large number of atoms coupled to a common em field can radiate collectively such that the spontaneous radiation can be enhanced in certain directions .",
    "since then there have been many studies of the collective radiative properties of multi - atom system demonstrating the dependence of the emitted radiation on the number of atoms and the geometry of the emitting system  @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate radiative properties of an open system of a line of few atoms and demonstrate that the dipole - dipole interaction between atoms may lead to a collective ordering of the emission along some specific directions . to determine directions of the emission , we introduce the directivity function of the emitted radiation field and study the dependence of the function on the distance between the atoms .",
    "we analyze the directional properties of the radiation field for two different configurations of the atomic chains , one mimicking an atom in front of a mirror and the other an atom inside a cavity . in the first , we choose the left - hand - side atom of the chain as a probe atom and examine conditions under which the system may radiate only to those modes whose propagation vectors lie within a small solid angle about the inter atomic axis and oriented in one of the two directions of the inter atomic axis ,",
    "either right ( forward ) or left ( backward ) direction .",
    "such a system can be regarded as an atom in front of perfectly reflecting or perfectly transmitting atomic mirror . in the second arrangement",
    ", we choose the middle atom of the chain as a probe atom and examine conditions under which the system may radiate only to those modes whose propagation vectors lie within a small solid angle about the inter atomic axis .",
    "such a scheme can be regarded as an atom inside a single - mode cavity .",
    "we find that there is a threshold for the inter atomic distances above which a highly directional emission could be achieved . below the threshold",
    "the emission is spherically symmetric .",
    "however , we find a population trapping in one of the mirror atoms . for the cavity - like arrangement , the directivity function depends strongly on the number of atoms contained in the chain and the distance between them . for a @xmath0-atom chain and atomic distances above the threshold ,",
    "two radiative modes of different spatial directions are available for the emission , one in the direction parallel and the other in the direction normal to the inter - atomic axis . below the threshold ,",
    "the system can radiate only to the mode normal to the inter atomic axis . for a @xmath1-atom chain and distances above the threshold ,",
    "only one mode is available for emission , either normal or parallel to the atomic line .",
    "thus , there exist ranges of the inter atomic distances under which the atomic chain exhibits features characteristic of a single - mode cavity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we describe the master equation of the density operator of the system and the mathematical approach used in the evaluation of the density matrix elements . we introduce the definitions of the directivity function , reflection and transmission coefficients of the radiation field emitted by a chain of atoms . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we examine the conditions for the mirror - type behavior of short chains composed of @xmath0 and @xmath1 atoms .",
    "we observe the transient transfer of the population between the atoms and the transient directivity function for an initial condition in which the probe atom is prepared in its excited state .",
    "then , we examine the directivity function of the stationary field when the probe atom is driven by a continuous wave ( cw ) laser field .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] is devoted to the problem of a cavity formation with atomic mirrors .",
    "we are particularly interested in the possibility of the system to concentrate the radiation along the inter atomic axis and thus to behave as a single - mode cavity .",
    "polar diagrams are given to illustrate the mirror and cavity - like features of atomic chains and to show how the features are sensitive to distances between the atoms .",
    "the results are summarized in sec .",
    "the paper concludes with an appendix6a in which we give details of the derivation of the atomic correlation functions in terms of the populations of the collective states of a three - atom system and the coherences between them and appendix6b where the calculation of equations of motion has been presented .",
    "we consider a system composed of @xmath2 identical two - level atoms located at fixed positions @xmath3 and coupled to the three - dimensional electromagnetic field whose modes are initially in a vacuum state @xmath4 .",
    "each atom has an excited state @xmath5 and a ground state @xmath6 separated by energy  @xmath7 and connected by a transition dipole moment  @xmath8 .     from its nearest neighbor with the remaining atoms equally separated from each other by a distance @xmath9 .",
    "( b ) the middle atom of the chain , chosen as a probe atom , is separated from its next - neighbors by @xmath10 , while the remaining atoms are equally separated by a distance  @xmath9 . ]",
    "the atoms are arranged in a line , and we consider two cases shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the first case , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , we assume that the left - side atom , chosen as a  probe \" atom is separated from its next - neighbor by a distance @xmath10 which is larger than the separation @xmath11 between the remaining @xmath12 atoms , @xmath13 . if the probe atom is excited into its upper level , it will spontaneously decay into the ground state emitting the radiation field that can be absorbed by the chain of closely located atoms and then re - emitted by the atoms towards the probe atom .",
    "thus , the chain of closely located atoms could act as a mirror , directing the emitted radiation into a cone about the interatomic axis and turned towards the probe atom . in the second case , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , we assume that the middle atom of the chain is separated from its adjacent neighbors by a distance @xmath10 , which is much larger that the separation @xmath11 between the remaining atoms .",
    "this arrangement may model a situation of an atom located inside a cavity whose mirrors are formed by two chains of equally distant atoms .    in practice",
    "this scheme could be realized by extending the recently demonstrated scheme involving two superconducting qubits coupled to a 1d field  @xcite to the case of three or five qubits coupled to a 2d field . in the experiment of ref .",

    "the intensity of the radiation field emitted at time  @xmath43 in the direction specified by the polar angle @xmath44 between the direction of observation @xmath45 and the direction of the atomic axis @xmath30 can be expressed in terms of the correlation functions of the atomic dipole operators as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the radiation pattern of a single atomic dipole , with @xmath48 the angle between the observation direction @xmath45 and the direction of the atomic transition dipole moment @xmath49 . since the radiation intensity @xmath50 is symmetric about the interatomic axis , it defines a two - dimensional surface called the polar radiation pattern of the emitting system .",
    "we may introduce the _ directivity _ function determining of how effective the atoms are in converging the emitted radiation into a small solid angle centered about the direction @xmath44 . the directivity function @xmath51 in the direction @xmath44 at time @xmath43",

    "it is equivalent to the probability density of detecting a fluorescence photon traveling in the direction @xmath44 .    since our interest is in situations where a chain of atoms works as an atomic mirror , an important factor is the ability of producing highly directional patterns of the radiation concentrated in one of the two directions along the interatomic axis , either @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "following the arrangement illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , @xmath59 describes the radiation field emitted along the atomic axis in the direction towards the probe atom , the `` backward '' direction .",

    "the directivity @xmath60 describes the radiation field emitted along the atomic axis in the direction away from the probe atom , the  forward \" direction .",
    "therefore , it would correspond to the transmission coefficient of the atomic mirror .",
    "thus , we may define the _ reflection _ coefficient of the chain of atoms as the ratio of the radiation intensity emitted in the direction @xmath61 to the total radiation intensity @xmath62 the reflection coefficient is a measure of how effective the atoms are in concentrating the radiation about one side of the interatomic axis , i.e. about the direction @xmath63 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath64 is equivalent to the probability density of detecting a fluorescence photon traveling in the direction  @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , we can define the _ transmission _ coefficient of the chain as the ratio of the radiation intensity emitted in the direction @xmath57 to the total intensity of the field emitted @xmath65 obviously , @xmath66 would correspond to complete transmission whereas @xmath67 would correspond to complete reflection of the radiation field emitted along the atomic axis .",
    "the quantity of central interest is the directivity function which can be determined from analyzing the polar radiation pattern of a chain of atoms .",
    "we may determine general conditions under which the radiation pattern of @xmath2 atoms would be highly non spherical and its maximum is concentrated along the inter atomic axis .",
    "the conclusions will serve as reference for choosing distances between the atoms and for calculations of the atomic populations and correlations .    the expression ( [ q6 ] ) can be written as a sum of @xmath2 terms @xmath68 where @xmath69 we see that the contribution of the atoms to the intensity occurs in pairs of different combinations of the atoms . therefore , the system of radiating atoms can be considered as made up of a number of short two - atom elements and the total intensity is obtained by summing up the intensities of the fields produced by all the elements .",
    "if we wish a short chain of atoms to work like a mirror with a large convergence and reflectivity of the radiation emitted by a probe atom located at either end of the chain , we should arrange the atoms such that the total field emitted ( scattered ) could be highly focused along the interatomic axis with a pronounced maximum in the backward direction @xmath70 and a minimum , preferably zero emission in the forward direction @xmath71 with respect to the line center . in order to find the conditions for concentrating the radiation in the direction @xmath61 ,",
    "let us examine the intensity ( [ q8 ] ) in more details .    from eq .",
    "( [ q8 ] ) it is seen that there are three terms determining the radiation pattern . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ q8 ] ) is just the sum of the populations of the two atoms involved , the probabilities that the atoms are in their excited states .",
    "this term is independent of @xmath44 and therefore contributes uniformly in all directions .",
    "the second term depends on @xmath44 and varies as @xmath72 with an amplitude equal to the real part of atomic correlations .",
    "consequently , this term could contribute to the radiation pattern only if the correlations between the atoms would have nonzero real part , @xmath73 .",
    "however , the cosine term , although dependent on @xmath44 , would produce intensity maxima in the @xmath74 and @xmath75 directions .",
    "as such this term is not effective in concentrating the radiation along the interatomic axis .",
    "this simple argument suggests that the atoms should be arranged such that the cosine term vanishes .",
    "this could be achieved when the correlations between the atoms have zero real part .",
    "the third term contributing to the radiation intensity  ( [ q8 ] ) varies as @xmath76 and hence can affect the radiation intensity in a decidedly different way than the cosine term .",
    "an important difference is that @xmath76 vanishes for @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "this means that the sine term does not contribute to the radiation emitted in the direction perpendicular to the interatomic axis .",
    "consequently , an appreciable concentration of the radiation could be achieved along the interatomic axis by choosing proper distances @xmath27 between the atoms at which @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore , since the sine is an odd function , it follows that @xmath80 , which means that independent of the separation between the atoms a maximum in the backward direction is always accompanied by a minimum in the forward direction .",
    "obviously , the sine term could influence the angular distribution of the radiation intensity only if the atomic correlations would have nonzero imaginary parts , @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , the sign of the imaginary part of the atomic correlations dictates the choice of distances between the atoms , at which the emission would be enhanced in the backward direction ( high reflection ) and reduced in the forward direction ( low transmission ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath82 , the sine term will display a maximum in the backward direction for atomic distances at which @xmath83 .",
    "this condition is satisfied when the atomic separations are @xmath84 however , if the coefficient of the sine term is negative , @xmath85 , a different choice of the distances is required at which @xmath86 .",
    "this condition is satisfied when @xmath87 we see that there is a lower bound imposed on the distances between the atoms , either @xmath88 or @xmath89 , above which a one - sided emission along the interatomic axis can be achieved , i.e. , a maximum of radiation in the direction @xmath71 . for distances smaller",
    "that the lower bound , the one - sided emission is expected to be significantly reduced .    in the following ,",
    "we limit ourselves to short chains containing only @xmath90 and @xmath91 atoms .",
    "also in the absence of the driving field , @xmath92 , the @xmath90 case can be solved in closed form yielding simple expressions . in the  appendix6a ,",
    "we outline the calculation of atomic correlation functions in the collective state basis .      to study the radiative behavior of a chain of interacting atoms",
    ", we require the time evolution of the populations of the atoms and the coherence between them .",
    "these are given by the diagonal and off - diagonal density matrix elements , respectively .",
    "if the space of the atomic system is spanned in the basis of the eigenstates of the free hamiltonian @xmath31 , we readily find that the basis is composed of @xmath93 state vectors , i.e. for a chain composed of @xmath90 atoms , the basis is composed of @xmath94 vectors @xmath95 , whereas for @xmath91 atoms it is composed of @xmath96 vectors @xmath97 .",
    "hence , in the simplest case of @xmath90 atoms , the master equation ( [ q1 ] ) provides us with a system of @xmath96 coupled linear equations to be solved , in principle , a @xmath98 matrix to be diagonalized .",
    "for @xmath91 we get a system of @xmath99 coupled linear equations whose solution requires a @xmath100 matrix to be diagonalized .",
    "needless to say , it is not easily accomplished .",
    "therefore , we shall use numerical methods . to get solutions for the density matrix elements , the following approach will be taken .    from the master equation ( [ q1 ] ) , we find equations of motion for the density matrix elements , which can be written in a matrix form as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a column vector composed of the density matrix elements , @xmath45 is a column vector composed of the inhomogenous terms , and @xmath103 is a matrix of the coefficients appearing in the equations of motion of the density matrix elements .    a direct integration of eq .",
    "( [ q17 ] ) leads to the following formal solution for @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the initial time .",
    "because the determinant of the matrix @xmath103 is different from zero , there exists a complex invertible matrix @xmath107 which diagonalizes @xmath103 , and @xmath108 is the diagonal matrix of complex eigenvalues . by introducing new vectors @xmath109 and @xmath110 , we can rewrite ( [ q18 ] ) as @xmath111 or in component form @xmath112 in which @xmath113 for the case of @xmath90 atoms and @xmath114 for @xmath91 atoms . to obtain solutions for @xmath115 we must determine the eigenvalues @xmath116 and eigenvectors @xmath117 which are readily evaluated by a numerical diagonalization of the matrix @xmath103 .",

    "( [ q20 ] ) by taking @xmath118 , or more directly by setting the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ q17 ] ) equal to zero , and then @xmath119 or in component form @xmath120    in what follows , we shall use the solutions ( [ q20 ] ) and ( [ q22 ] ) to illustrate the radiative properties of the atomic chains .",
    "in particular , we calculate the transient populations of the atoms and the steady - state directivity function .",
    "consider first the configuration illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , a single atom distance @xmath121 from a finite - size chain of closely located atoms .",
    "this arrangement could constitute a radiating atom at front of an atomic mirror . in order to find the mirror - like characteristics of the chain that could be inferred from the radiative properties of the systems , we examine the directivity function of the radiation field emitted by the system .",
    "the directivity function , which is determined by the angular distribution of the radiation intensity , eq .",
    "( [ q7 ] ) , depends on temporal and spatial factors , the time of the evolution of the system and the separation between the atoms .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ q7 ] ) that in general the temporal and spatial factors can not be separated .",
    "the angular distribution of the radiation field at a given time can be different for different separations between the atoms .",
    "moreover , the transient radiation intensity is a sensitive function of the initial atomic conditions . even at the initial time",
    "@xmath122 the angular distribution of the radiation intensity can depend on the separation @xmath27 if the system was prepared in a state with nonzero interatomic correlations , either @xmath123 or @xmath124 different from zero . in order to study the angular distribution of the radiation field , it is important to understand the radiative behavior of individual atoms in the chain",
    ". therefore , we first consider the evolution of the populations of the atoms . following this discussion , we display the variation of the directivity function with time for different distances between the atoms .",

    "we also see quite clearly that larger separations between the mirror atoms , additional directions of emission appear [ fig .",

    "we have studied directional properties of the radiation field emitted by a chain of closely located and dipole - dipole interacting two - level atoms .",
    "two geometrical configurations of atoms in the chain have been studied : a probe atom in front of a finite - size chain of closely located atoms , and a probe atom between a pair of chains of closely located atoms .",
    "we call the earlier case as an atom in front of an atomic mirror , and the former as an atom inside a cavity whose the mirrors are formed by the two chains of atoms .",
    "we have found that it is possible to account for certain mirror and cavity - like features , such as we have examined the conditions for one - sided emission centered about the interatomic axis , and have found a lower bound for the distance between the atoms above which a one - sided emission along the interatomic axis can be achieved .",
    "the one - sided emission focused into a cone about the interatomic axis and oriented in the backward direction can be regarded as a mirror type with perfect reflectivity . for atomic distances smaller than the lower bound",
    ", a part of the population can be trapped in the probe atom indicating that at these distances there are no radiative modes available for the emission .",
    "this is a situation similar to that one encounters in a fabry - prot cavity composed of a pair of parallel plate mirrors  @xcite .",
    "polar diagrams have been presented showing the variation of the directivity function of the time dependent as well as the stationary fields with the separation between the atoms .",
    "we have found that the directional properties of the radiation field are generally more manifested in the stationary field when the probe atom is continuously driven by a coherent laser field .",
    "the control of directionality of photon emission could have applications in quantum information processing in realizing a directional quantum network .",
    "for example , the mirror - like behavior of the chain could be used to realize a chiral quantum network , where atoms interact via one - way emission  @xcite .",
    "it could also be used as an optical reflector or an optical mirror to create , together with a distant dielectric mirror , a fabry - prot cavity  @xcite .",
