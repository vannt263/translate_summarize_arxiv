    "entanglement has been regarded as the essential resource for quantum information processing and quantum communication @xcite . from a perspective of applications ,",
    "the entangled systems shared by the separated parties in distant locations are required to be in a maximally entangled state for the efficiency and the security of quantum communication @xcite . especially , multipartite entangled systems have many vital applications in quantum computation @xcite and quantum communication , such as controlled teleportation @xcite , quantum state sharing @xcite , quantum secret sharing @xcite , and so on . however , all these tasks are based on the fact that the quantum channel with multipartite entangled states shared by the legitimate distant participants has been set up beforehand .",
    "it is well known that the parties in quantum communication can not create nonlocal entanglement with local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "the distribution of entanglement created locally is inevitable .",
    "however , in a practical transmission , the particles propagated away from each other are destined to suffer from channel noises , which will degrade the entanglement or even make the maximally entangled state become a mixed one .",
    "therefore , it will decrease the fidelity of quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum dense coding @xcite , and make the quantum communication insecure @xcite .",
    "recently , much attention has been drawn to entanglement purification @xcite , a fascinating tool for the parties in quantum communication to extract some high - fidelity entangled states from a set of less entangled systems . the original entanglement purification protocol ( epp ) by bennett _",
    "_ @xcite and that by deutch _",
    "@xcite are expressed in terms of the quantum controlled - not ( cnot ) logic operations .",
    "subsequently , pan _",
    "@xcite introduced an epp with linear optical elements based on the polarization degree of freedom of photons . in 2002 ,",
    "simon and pan @xcite presented an epp with a currently available parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) source . in 2008 , sheng _",
    "@xcite proposed an efficient epp based on a pdc source with cross - kerr nonlinearity and it can , in principle , be repeated to obtain a high - fidelity entangled ensemble . in 2011 ,",
    "wang , zhang , and jin @xcite proposed an interesting epp based on cross - kerr nonlinearity and the measurement on the intensity of coherent beams . in 2010 , sheng and deng @xcite introduced the concept of deterministic entanglement purification and proposed a two - step deterministic entanglement purification protocol ( depp ) , the first depp in which the parties can obtain a maximally entangled state from each system transmitted , far different from the conventional entanglement purification protocols ( cepps ) @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a one - step depp @xcite was proposed , only resorting to the spatial entanglement or the frequency entanglement of a practical pdc source and linear optical elements .",
    "in essence , both the cepps @xcite and the depps @xcite are based on entanglement transfer . taking the epp for photon systems as an example ,",
    "the cepps are based on the entanglement transfer between different entangled photon systems , while the depps are based on the transfer between different degrees of freedom of the entangled photon system itself .",
    "the depps require that at least one degree of freedom of photons is stable when the photons are transmitted over a noisy channel , while the cepps only require that there is entanglement in the ensemble after transmission .    up to now",
    ", most of epps @xcite are focused on bipartite entangled photon systems and there are only several multipartite entanglement purification protocols , including high - dimension epps @xcite .",
    "for instance , in 1998 , murao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed the first multipartite entanglement purification protocol ( mepp ) to purify multipartite entangled systems in a werner - type state , with cnot gates . in 2007 , this protocol was extended to high - dimensional multipartite quantum systems by cheong _",
    "@xcite , resorting to some generalized xor gates , instead of the common cnot gates . in 2009 , with the considerable experimental progress achieved , sheng _ et al .",
    "_ introduced a feasible mepp for @xmath0-photon systems in a greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xcite . in their protocol , quantum nondemolition detector ( qnd ) is exploited to fulfill the functions of the parity - check gate . with qnds , the parties can obtain some high - fidelity ghz - state systems from the less entangled ones by performing the protocol iteratively .",
    "a conduction electron can act as a qubit in both the charge degree of freedom and the spin degree of freedom , which are relatively independent on each other .",
    "in other words , when we measure the charge of an electron system , its spin state would be kept unaffected , and vice versa . owing to this fantastic feature , charge detection @xcite has been exploited to accomplish many works , such as the cont gate between electronic qubits @xcite , the generation of the entangled spins @xcite , the multipartite entanglement analyzer @xcite , and so on . also , some epps and an entanglement concentration protocol for electron systems have been proposed @xcite .",
    "for example , in 2005 , feng _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed an electronic epp for purifying two - electron systems in a werner state with parity - check measurements based on charge detection @xcite , following some ideas in the original epp proposed by bennett _",
    "@xcite for photon pairs . in 2011 , sheng _",
    "@xcite presented a mepp for electron - spin states and wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a two - electron epp by using quantum - dot spins in optical microcavities .",
    "although there are some mepps and some two - electron epps , the efficiency in these protocols is relatively low .    in this work",
    ", we present a high - efficiency mepp for electron - spin systems in a ghz state with charge detection .",
    "it contains two parts .",
    "one is our normal mepp with which the parties in quantum communication can distill a high - fidelity @xmath0-electron ensemble directly , by replacing perfect cnot gates with the parity- check detectors based on charge detection in ref .",
    "@xcite , but with a higher efficiency .",
    "the other is our recycling mepp in which the entanglement link based on charge detection is used to produce some @xmath0-electron entangled systems from entangled @xmath1-electron subsystems ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "it is interesting to show that the entangled @xmath1-electron subsystems can be obtained efficiently from the cross - combination items , which are useless and are just discarded in all existing conventional epps @xcite . with these two parts ,",
    "the present mepp for electron - spin states has efficiency higher than all other mepps largely .",
    "we discuss the detail of our high - yield mepp for electron - spin states of three - electron systems and its principle is suitable to the @xmath0-electron systems in an arbitrary ghz state .",
    "our thee - electron epp contains two parts , which makes it different from others @xcite .",
    "one is our normal mepp with which the parties can obtain a high - fidelity three - electron ensemble directly , similar to all existing mepps .",
    "the other is our recycling mepp with entanglement link from subsystems . in the second part",
    ", the quantum resources are obtained from the systems with less entanglement which are just discarded in all other mepps .",
    "we introduce the principles of these two parts independently as follows .",
    "before we start to explain the principle of our mepp , we present a detailed description of a parity - check detector ( pcd ) which is thought to be more feasible as a basic element for epp than a perfect cnot gate . in fig.[fig1 ] , the polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) transmits the electrons in the spin - up state @xmath4 and reflects the ones in the spin - down state @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , for two electrons coming from two different inputs of the first pbs , if they leave through different outputs of the first pbs , the charge detector ( c ) will get the charge occupation number @xmath6 ; otherwise @xmath7 or 2 .",
    "the charge detector can distinguish the occupation number one from the occupation numbers 0 and 2 , but it can not distinguish the case between 0 and 2 .",
    "in other words , it can only distinguish the instances that the occupation number is even or odd @xcite . with this feature",
    ", one can see that the states @xmath8 and @xmath9 will lead the charge detector to obtain the charge occupation number @xmath6 as the two electrons passing through the first pbs will leave through different modes .",
    "however , the states @xmath10 and @xmath11 will lead the charge detector to be @xmath7 and @xmath12 , respectively . as mentioned above , the charge detector can not distinguish 0 and 2 , and it will show the same result , i.e. , @xmath7 for simplicity .",
    "that is , we can distinguish the states @xmath8 and @xmath9 from @xmath10 and @xmath11 , according to the different outcomes of the charge detector .",
    "the second pbs is used to split the two electrons passing through the charge detector , without destroying their spin states .",
    "in essence , the setup shown in fig.[fig1 ] is just a parity - check detector ( pcd ) for the spins of two electrons .     and reflects the electron in the spin - down state @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 represents a mirror for the spins of an electron .",
    "@xmath14 represents a charge detector and it can distinguish the electron number @xmath6 from @xmath7.,width=264 ]    for a three - electron spin system , there are eight ghz states , @xmath15 here the subscripts @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath14 represent the three electrons belonging to the three parties , say alice , bob , and charlie , respectively .",
    "suppose that the original ghz state transmitted is @xmath18 .",
    "as we know , the noisy channel will inevitably degrade the entanglement of the state or even make it be a mixed one . in detail , if the initial state @xmath18 becomes @xmath19 , a bit - flip error takes place on the @xmath20-th qubit ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "if the state @xmath18 evolves to @xmath22 , we say that a phase - flip error appears .",
    "sometimes , both a bit - flip error and a phase - flip error will take place on the three - electron system such as the state @xmath23 . in order to purify three - electron entangled systems ,",
    "we are required to correct both bit - flip errors and phase - flip errors on the quantum system .",
    "usually , an epp can be divided into two steps @xcite .",
    "one is used to purify the bit - flip error and the other is to the phase - flip error . in the second step , the phase - flip error will be transformed into the bit - flip error with a hadamard operation on each qubit and then the parties purify the bit - flip error with the similar processes to these in the first step . that is , the phase - flip error can , in principle , be purified with the similar processes @xcite .",
    "we only discuss the principle of the present mepp for three - electron systems with bit - flip errors below",

    "@xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the probability that the three - electron system is in the state @xmath34 .",
    "they satisfy the relation @xmath35 for obtaining some high - fidelity three - electron entangled systems , the three parties should operate a pair of three - electron systems in the state @xmath28 with locc .",
    "the principle of our normal three - electron epp is shown in fig.[fig2_meepp ] .",
    "we label the two three - electron systems with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the state of the six - electron system @xmath38 is @xmath39 .",
    "it can be viewed as the mixture of the 16 pure states , i.e. , @xmath40 with the probability of @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the three parties make the electron pair they own pass through their pcds .",
    "that is , the electron @xmath43 entrances the up spatial mode and @xmath44 the down - spatial mode , for comparing the spin parity of their electron pair .",
    "after the parity - check measurements , alice , bob , and charlie communicate their outcomes , and they keep the instances in which all the three parties obtain an even parity or an odd parity .    when the parities of the electron pairs obtained by alice , bob , and charlie are all even , the state of the complicated system composed of the six electrons @xmath38 becomes a mixed one @xmath45 ( without normalization ) , @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( without normalization ) , @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "that is , they can obtain the result that the complicated system composed of the six electrons @xmath38 is in a mixture state @xmath50 ( without normalization ) @xmath51 we need only discuss the case that the system is in the states @xmath52 with the probabilities @xmath53 below .",
    "in the three down - spatial modes , a hadamard ( @xmath54 ) operation is performed on each of the electrons @xmath44 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , which will lead to the transformation @xmath57 that is , the states @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xmath60 will be changed into some other states .",
    "alice , bob , and charlie measure the spin states of the down - spatial modes @xmath37 .",
    "it is not difficult to find that the outcomes can be divided into two groups , by considering the number of the spin - down electrons @xmath61 . in the first case where @xmath61 is even ,",
    "that is , if they obtain the outcomes of measurements on their electrons through the down - spatial modes @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 or @xmath65 , alice , bob , and charlie will get the three - electron ghz states @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , or @xmath69 with the probabilities of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , or @xmath73 , respectively . in the other case where @xmath61 is odd ,",
    "that is , if they obtain the outcomes @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 or @xmath77 , they will get the other three - electron ghz states @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , or @xmath81 with the probabilities of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , or @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "for the second case , in order to obtain the ghz state without phase - flip errors , the three participants should flip the relative phase of their electron system @xmath36 . for simplicity , here we transform the state @xmath82 into @xmath45 . in fact",
    ", we can easily demonstrate that the conclusion is also suitable for @xmath82 .",
    "in other words , the transformation is unnecessary .",
    "up to now , by keeping the instances in which all the parties obtain the same parity , and then measuring the electron spins from the down - spatial modes after the h operations , the quantum state of the three - electron system @xmath83 becomes @xmath84 . here",

    "moreover , we give a general form for the purification of bit - flip errors in three - electron systems , not a werner - type state @xcite or a simplified mixed entangled state @xcite , which makes our normal mepp have a higher efficiency than others @xcite .",
    "especially , it doubles the efficiency of the mepp for three - electron systems in ref.@xcite as the three parties not only consider the case in which they all obtain an even parity but also the case they all obtain an odd parity .      in our normal three - electron epp for bit - flip errors",

    "that is , alice , bob , and charlie will obtain the state @xmath98 and @xmath99 with the same probability .",
    "these instances will decrease the fidelity of the state @xmath100 in the three - electron systems kept .",
    "this is just the reason that all existing cepps discard the cross - combination items .",
    "however , we can not come to a simple conclusion that the cross - combination items are useless , because they can be used to distill some high - fidelity two - electron entangled states . with a set of high - fidelity two - electron entangled subsystems , alice , bob , and charlie can produce a subset of high - fidelity three - electron",
