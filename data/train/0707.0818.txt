    "in this paper we study the number of open paths in an oriented @xmath1-percolation model in dimension @xmath10 , or , equivalenly , the number of @xmath1-open path in an oriented percolation model .",
    "consider the graph @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , and fix some parameter  @xmath13 .",
    "to each site of this graph except the origin , assign a variable taking value  @xmath14 with probability  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 with probability @xmath17 , independently of the other sites .",
    "an oriented ( sometimes also called _ semi - oriented _ ) path of length  @xmath0 is a sequence @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are neighbours in  @xmath21 , @xmath22 : viewing the first coordinate as time , one can think of such path as a path of the @xmath23-dimensional simple random walk .",
    "fix another parameter @xmath24 $ ] ; the concept of @xmath1-percolation was introduced by menshikov and zuev in @xcite , as the occurence of an infinite length path with asymptotic density of 1s larger of equal to @xmath1 . as in classical percolation ,",
    "this probability of this event is subject to a dychotomy @xcite according to @xmath15 larger or smaller than some critical threshold , which was later studied by kesten and su @xcite in the asymptotics of large dimension .    in the present paper , we discuss paths of finite length @xmath0 , in the limit @xmath3 . an oriented path of length  @xmath0 is called @xmath1-open , if the proportion of @xmath14s in it is at least  @xmath1 . from standard percolation theory",
    "it is known that for large  @xmath15 there are @xmath14-open oriented paths with nonvanishing probability , and from  @xcite that for any  @xmath15 one can find @xmath1 larger than @xmath15 such that , almost surely , there are @xmath1-open oriented paths for large @xmath0 . however , the question of how many such paths of length  @xmath0 can be found in a typical situation , was still unaddressed in the literature . when finishing this manuscript , we have learned of the related work  @xcite .    in this paper , we prove that the number of different @xmath1-open paths of length  @xmath0 behaves like @xmath2 , where the exponent @xmath25 is deterministic and , of course , also depends on  @xmath15 and  @xmath23 .",
    "we prove that the function @xmath26 is the negative convex conjugate of the free energy of _ directed polymers in random environment_. this model has attracted a lot of interest in recent years , leading to a better  although very incomplete  understanding .",
    "we will extensively use the current knowledge of thermodynamics of the polymer model , and the reader is refered to @xcite for a recent survey .",
    "this will allow us to obtain , when  @xmath27 , the explicit expression for @xmath25 in a certain range of values for @xmath1 depending on the parameters  @xmath15 and  @xmath23 .",
    "the reason for this remarkable fact is the existence of the so - called `` weak - disorder region '' in the polymer model , discovered in @xcite and @xcite : this reflects here into a parameter region where the number of paths is of the same order as its expected value .    at this point the reader may be tempted to use first and second moment methods to estimate the number of paths .",
    "the first moment is easily computed , and serves as an upper bound in complete generality .",
    "the second moment is more difficult to analyse .",
    "however , it can be checked that in large dimension and for density close to the parameter @xmath15 of the bernoulli , the ratio second - to - first - squared remains bounded in the limit of an infinitely long path .",
    "this means that , under these circumstances , the upper bound gives the right order of magnitude with a positive probability .",
    "however , ( i ) this method does not tell us anything on @xmath4 for general parameters , ( ii ) it fails to keep track of the correlation between counts for different values of the density .",
    "our strategy will be quite different .",
    "we will study the _ moment generating function _ of the number of paths , which is not surprising in such a combinatorial problem .",
    "the point is that the moment generating function is simply the partition function of the directed polymer in random environment .",
    "this is a well - known object in statistical physics , its logarithmic asymptotics is well studied , and is given by the free energy . from the existence and known properties of the free energy , we will derive the existence of @xmath4 and its expression in thermodynamics terms .",
    "in the course of our analysis we will prove that the free energy , a convex function of the inverse temperature , is in fact strictly convex .",
    "this property is new and interesting for the polymer model .",
    "moreover , in a more restricted range of values for @xmath1 , we even obtain an equivalent for the number of paths which achieves exactly a given density of 1s .",
    "this is clearly a very sharp estimate , that we obtain by using the power of complex analysis , and convergence of the renormalized moment generating function in the sense of analytic functions .",
    "certainly a naive moments method can not lead to such an equivalent .",
    "now , let us define the model formally .",
    "let @xmath28 be a sequence of independent identically distributed bernoulli random variables , with common parameter @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 the probability space where this sequence is defined .",
    "the vertex @xmath32 is _ open _ if @xmath33 and _ closed _ in the opposite case .",
    "a nearest neighbour path  @xmath34 in @xmath21 of length @xmath0 ( @xmath35 ) is a sequence @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "we denote by @xmath38 the set of such paths @xmath34 , and by @xmath39 the set of infinite length nearest neighbour paths . for @xmath40 ,",

    "is concerned with the event that there exists an infinite open path @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath42 it is well known @xcite that there exists @xmath43 , called the critical percolation threshold , such that @xmath44 for @xmath45 $ ] , menshikov and zuev @xcite introduced @xmath1-percolation as the event that there exists an infinite path @xmath34 with asymptotic proportion at least @xmath1 of open sites , @xmath46 they showed that there also exists a threshold @xmath47 such that ( [ eq:11062 ] ) holds with @xmath48 instead of @xmath49 ( with the probability of @xmath48 being equal to 1 when @xmath50 ) .",
    "very little has been proved for @xmath1-percolation .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath47 for large @xmath23 are obtained in @xcite at first order , showing that @xmath51 has a limit as @xmath52 , and that the limit is different from the analogous quantity for @xmath23-ary trees .",
    "as mentioned in this reference , the equality @xmath53 follows from theorem 5 of @xcite .",
