    "gibrat  @xcite , building upon the work of the astronomers kapteyn and uven  @xcite , assumed the expected value of the growth rate of a business firm s size to be proportional to the current size of the firm ( the so called `` law of proportionate effect '' )  @xcite .",
    "several models of proportional growth have been subsequently introduced in economics to explain the growth of business firms  @xcite .",
    "simon and co - authors  @xcite extended gibrat s model by introducing an entry process according to which the number of firms rise over time . in simon s framework , the market consists of a sequence of many independent `` opportunities '' which arise over time , each of size unity",
    ". models in this tradition have been challenged by many researchers  @xcite who found that the firm growth distribution is not gaussian but displays a tent shape .    using a database on the size and growth of firms and products , we characterize the shape of the whole growth rate distribution .",
    "then we introduce a general framework that provides an unifying explanation for the growth of business firms based on the number and size distribution of their elementary constituent components  @xcite .",
    "specifically we present a model of proportional growth in both the number of units and their size and we draw some general implications on the mechanisms which sustain business firm growth  @xcite . according to the model , the probability density function ( pdf ) of growth rates is laplace in the center  @xcite with power law tails  @xcite .",
    "we test our model by analyzing different levels of aggregation of economic systems , from the `` micro '' level of products to the `` macro '' level of industrial sectors and national economies .",
    "we find that the model accurately predicts the shape of the pdf of growth rate at any level of aggregation .",
    "we model business firms as classes consisting of a random number of units . according to this view ,",
    "a firm is represented as the aggregation of its constituent units such as divisions  @xcite , businesses  @xcite , or products  @xcite .",
    "we study the logarithm of the one - year growth rate of classes @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the sizes of classes in the year @xmath5 and @xmath6 measured in monetary values ( gdp for countries , sales for firms and products ) .",
    "the model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ schematic ] .",
    "the model is built upon two key sets of assumptions :    * the number of units in a class grows in proportion to the existing number of units ; * the size of each unit grows in proportion to its size .",
    "more specifically , the first set of assumptions is :    1 .   each class @xmath7 consists of @xmath8 number of units . at time",
    "@xmath9 , there are @xmath10 classes consisting of @xmath11 total number of units",
    ". 2 .   at each time",
    "step a new unit is created .",
    "thus the number of units at time @xmath5 is @xmath12 .",
    "3 .   with birth probability @xmath13 ,",
    "this new unit is assigned to a new class .",
    "4 .   with probability @xmath14",
    ", a new unit is assigned to an existing class @xmath7 with probability @xmath15 .",
    "the second set of assumptions of the model is :    1 .   at time @xmath5 , each class @xmath7 has @xmath8 units of size @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are independent random variables .",
    "2 .   at time @xmath6",
    ", the size of each unit is decreased or increased by a random factor @xmath20 so that @xmath21 where @xmath22 , the growth rate of unit @xmath23 , is independent random variable .",
    "based on the first set of assumptions , we derive @xmath24 , the probability distribution of the number of units in the classes at large @xmath5 .",
    "then , using the second set of assumptions with @xmath24 we calculate the probability distribution of growth rates @xmath0 .",
    "since the exact analytical solution of @xmath24 is not known , we provide approximate mean field solution for @xmath24 ( see , e.g. , chapter 6 of  @xcite ) .",
    "we also assume that @xmath24 follows exponential distribution either in old and new classes  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the distribution of units in all classes is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the distribution of units in pre - existing and new classes , respectively .",
    "let us assume both the size and growth of units ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively ) are distributed as @xmath30 and @xmath31 where @xmath32 means lognormal distribution .",
    "thus , for large @xmath33 , @xmath34 has a gaussian distribution @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the function of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the function of @xmath40 and @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the resulting distribution of the growth rates of all classes is determined by @xmath41 the approximate solution of @xmath0 is obtained by using eq .",
    "( [ p_large_k ] ) for @xmath42 for finite @xmath33 , mean field solution eq .",
    "( [ p_k_final ] ) for @xmath24 and replacing summation by integration in eq .",
    "( [ p_g_sum ] ) . after some algebra",
    ", we find that the the shape of @xmath0 based on either @xmath26 or @xmath27 is same , and @xmath0 is given as follows @xmath43 which behaves for @xmath44 as @xmath45 and for @xmath46 as @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the distribution is well approximated by a laplace distribution in the body with power - law tails .",
    "we analyze different levels of aggregation of economic systems , from the micro level of products to the macro level of industrial sectors and national economies .",
    "we study a unique database , the pharmaceutical industry database ( phid ) , which records sales figures of the @xmath48 products commercialized by @xmath49 pharmaceutical firms in @xmath50 countries from 1994 to 2004 , covering the whole size distribution for products and firms and monitoring the flows of entry and exit at both levels .",
    "moreover , we investigate the growth rates of all u.s . publicly - traded firms from 1973 to 2004 in all industries , based on security exchange commission filings ( compustat ) . finally , at the macro level , we study the growth rates of the gross domestic product ( gdp ) of @xmath51 countries from 1960 to 2004 ( world bank ) .",
    "figure  [ growth_dist_4industry]a shows that the growth distributions of countries , firms , and products seems quite different but in fig .",
    "[ growth_dist_4industry]b they are all well fitted by eq .",
    "( [ p_new ] ) just with different values of @xmath39 .",
    "growth distributions at any level of aggregation depict marked departures from a gaussian shape .",
    "moreover , while the @xmath0 of gdp can be approximated by a laplace distribution , the @xmath0 of firms and products are clearly more leptokurtic than laplace . coherently with the predictions of the model outlined in section [ sec : model ] , we find that both product and firm growth distributions are laplace in the body ( fig .  [ body ] ) , with power - law tails with an exponent @xmath1 ( fig .  [ tails ] ) .",
    "we introduce a simple and general model that accounts for both the central part and the tails of growth distributions at different levels of aggregation in economic systems . in particular , we show that the shape of the business firm growth distribution can be accounted for by a simple model of proportional growth in both number and size of their constituent units .",
    "the tails of growth rate distributions are populated by younger and smaller firms composed of one or few products while the center of the distribution is shaped by big multi - product firms .",
    "our model predicts that the growth distribution is laplace in the central part and depicts an asymptotic power - law behavior in the tails .",
    "we find that the model s predictions are accurate .",
