    "in which electron collisions with metal ions dictate the ionization state of the gas , the fractional abundance of these high ions peak at temperatures @xmath9@xmath10 k depending on their ionizing energies ( see below ) .",
    "plasmas in this temperature regime can be produced through moderate velocity shocks ( @xmath11@xmath12 @xmath3 ) or through the production of hotter coronal temperature gas ( @xmath13 k ) which subsequently cools through this temperature regime . in the latter case ,",
    "the quantity of high ions is related to the mass cooling rate of the coronal material .",
    "furthermore , because the high ions likely probe matter that is rapidly cooling from coronal temperatures to temperatures more appropriate for the general diffuse ism ( @xmath14 k ) , the high ions may often trace matter in the interfaces between these two temperature regimes . thus , the high ions are often used as indirect probes of energetic stellar feedback , the injection of energy into the interstellar medium ( ism ) from massive stars through their stellar winds and supernovae , in galactic environments .",
    "a significant fraction of this energy will be thermalized , producing the hot , highly ionized plasmas probed directly or indirectly by the high ions .",
    "there are complications , of course , in interpreting the relationship of the high ions to feedback .",
    "low density astrophysical plasmas with temperatures at which the high ions have their abundance peaks are significantly less stable than gas at higher or lower temperatures .",
    "gas at @xmath15@xmath10 k with near solar metallicities cools very rapidly since thermal electrons are able to excite the valence electrons into the upper states of the strong resonance transitions of these same high ions .",
    "the subsequent rapid removal of energy from the gas through spontaneous photon emission cools the gas much more rapidly that it can typically recombine .",
    "thus , low density plasmas at these temperatures are not likely to be in a state of collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) . in fig .",
    "[ f - ionicf ] , we show the equilibrium and non - equilibrium ionization fractions of si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0iv , n@xmath0v , and o@xmath0vi  produced in a radiatively cooling gas at solar metallicity from the calculations of @xcite .",
    "while the high ions peak in abundance at @xmath16 , in non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) , a substantial fraction of the high ions is present at temperatures much lower than @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "if such nei conditions are indeed important , high ions in this cooler temperature regime should be readily observable if studied with appropriate spectral resolution .",
    "yet , the importance of this cooler highly ionized phase remains largely unknown as we show below .",
    "several models for the production of high ions under nei conditions have been presented in the literature , including conductive interfaces , where the gas is initially heated up ( evaporative phase ) and then cooling when radiative cooling dominates ( condensing phase ) , turbulent mixing layers ( tmls ) in which velocity shear across an interface becomes unstable , mixing hot and warm gas in a turbulent fashion , shock ionization , and several variants of these processes ( e.g. , expanding superbubbles , supernova remnants , see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "it is important to note that all these collisional ionization models study mostly the evolution of the highly ionized gas that is cooling from the hot phase . indeed , while heating the gas can take place in the evaporative phase of a conductive interface , this process is short - lived ( @xmath17 yr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence unlikely to be seen often in absorption ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore the properties of the high ions give mostly clues on the physical mechanisms occurring in gas cooling from a hotter phase .",
    "radiation by massive hot stars or ob associations may also produce hard enough photons to ionize c@xmath0iv  and si@xmath0iv  ( ionizing energies @xmath18 and @xmath19 ev ) .",
    "while the addition of energetic radiation from hot plasmas in the winds of these stars can boost the amount of c@xmath0iv  relative to si@xmath0iv  @xcite , photoionization still fails to produce significant amounts of o@xmath0vi  ( @xmath20 ev ) or n@xmath0v  ( @xmath21 ev ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "( in the present study we will show an absence of strong narrow o@xmath0vi  or n@xmath0v  absorption , demonstrating this source of high ions does not contribute significantly to our sample . )",
    "a major shortcoming of the existing high ion surveys in the galaxy is that they were performed using moderate resolutions , with @xmath23@xmath24 @xmath3  ( fwhm ) .",
    "if cie conditions apply or the highly ionized gas is seen mostly at @xmath25 k , such resolution would be sufficient to derive the physical parameters ( the column density and doppler parameter or @xmath26-value ) from the absorbing gas . however , a few observations of the high ions obtained at resolutions @xmath273",

    "these stars are particularly suited to study the ism on large distant path as they are bright and provide generally a stellar continuum suitable for interstellar study .",
    "ob - type stars with emission lines or late b - type stars with low projected rotational velocities are , however , inadequate for studying the absorption from the high ions and were rejected from the sample .",
    "only galactic ob - type stars were considered because the interstellar spectra of hot stars in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) have the galactic and smc high - ion components blended .",
    "we also required that at least two of the three high ions ( i.e. , si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0iv , and/or n@xmath0v ) were covered by the e140h observations and detected with sufficient signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "these criteria resulted in the present sample of 38 stars .    in table",
    "[ t - data ] , the 38 stars are listed by alphabetical / numerical orders while in table  [ t - datao ] they are sorted by ascending galactic longitudes ; we use the latter sorting to number the stars with a unique i d number .",
    "we will refer mostly to this i d number in the remaining paper ( e.g. , star 11 refers to star hd18100 ) . for these 38 stars we also systematically searched for complementary stis e230h data where the al@xmath0iii  @xmath36@xmath361854 , 1862 lines are covered ; 14 stars were found .",
    "even if o@xmath0vi  was not observed at high resolution , its relationship with the other high ions is important to describe and decipher .",

    "the distances were derived following the method described by these authors ( see the appendix of their paper for further information and zech 2010 ) .    the distribution of the stars in an aitoff projection is shown in fig .",

    "only 4 stars are at @xmath42 kpc .",
    "the distances of the stars in our sample range from 0.2 to 6 kpc , with an average distance of 2.7 kpc ; about 30% have @xmath43 kpc , 50% @xmath44 kpc , and 20% @xmath45 kpc . the last column of table  [ t - datao ] indicates some known regions that the sight lines cross . except for stars 9 to 12 ,",
    "all the stars cross at least one of the radio loops ( i , ii , iii , iv ) .",
    "several stars probe ob associations .",
    "all the stars probe the interarm region between the perseus and carina arms as a consequence of the position of the earth in the milky way .",
    "many also probe the interarm region between carina and scutum - crux .",
    "two stars pass the perseus and scutum - crux arms , respectively .",
    "the major grouping of stars occurs in and toward the carina nebula ( stars 15 to 20 ) .    in summary , the assembled sample probes a variety of regions of the galaxy with some being very energetically active ( e.g. , carina nebula ) while others being more quiescent .",
    "a priori , the active regions may have an impact on the production of the high ions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and especially si@xmath0iv  and c@xmath0iv .",
    "observationally , e.g. , @xcite directly show the impact of the stellar environments in the lmc on the high - ion absorption : supergiant shells , x - ray bright superbubbles , h@xmath0ii  regions produce strong , narrow saturated si@xmath0iv  and c@xmath0iv  absorption in the lmc .",
    "as we will show , this is observed in the galaxy as well .",
    "it is therefore useful to differentiate x - ray bright from darker regions .",
    "following @xcite , we use the parameter @xmath46 , which scales with the excess of 0.251 kev x - ray excess emission in the region surrounding the star . by definition ,",
    "a @xmath47 value is a region free of any x - ray emission while @xmath48 is a target situated in a bright x - ray emission region , and @xmath49 is the intermediate case , generally a star near a diffuse enhancement or at the edge of a bright x - ray emission region . in table",
    "[ t - datao ] , we summarize the `` @xmath46 '' class . for the sight lines in common with @xcite , we simply adopted their @xmath46-values .",
    "as @xcite discussed , the separation between active ( `` bubble '' ) and quieter ( `` non - bubble '' ) regions is sometimes subjective .",
    "we emphasize that regions with large @xmath46 identify highly disturbed environments where the high ions may be produced , but not necessarily by processes directly related to the production of the x - rays .",
    "we also note that there is ( unsurprisingly ) some dependence between the type of the target star and the @xmath46-value along the sight line to the target star : 1 ) for types earlier than o7 , 11 sight lines along these stars have @xmath50 and only 1 has @xmath47 ; 2 ) for types later than o9 , the sample is not as bias with 17 @xmath47 sight lines and 9 @xmath50 sight lines .      for this study only observations made with the e140h and e230h high - resolution stis  setup",
    "were selected .",
    "the observations were obtained with three different apertures : @xmath51 ( jenkins slit ) , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "these three apertures each have their own line - spread function ( lsf ) , which we adopt from the stis  instrument handbook @xcite . for e140h",

    "the resolving power for e230h with the jenkins slit is slightly less with @xmath58 but similar ( @xmath59 ) for the @xmath52 aperture . for a full description of the design and construction of stis",
    "see woodgate et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and a summary of the stis  on - orbit performance is given by @xcite .",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite who discuss e140h data in more detail .",
    "table  [ t - data ] summarizes the stis  data for each star , including the aperture used , and the wavelength coverage .",
    "the data were reduced with the calstis  ( ver .",
    "2.22 ) pipeline in order to provide orbital doppler shift adjustments , detector nonlinearity corrections , dark image subtraction , flat - field division , background subtraction , wavelength zero - point calibration , and to convert the wavelengths into the heliocentric reference frame .",
    "the individual exposures were weighted by their inverse variance .",
    "as calstis  does not coadd the various echelle - order , one of us ( j.c .",
    "howk ) developed a series of idl routines to coadd them in order to produce a single coadded spectrum .",
    "we then applied a velocity shift to each star in order to transform the heliocentric reference frame into the local standard of rest ( lsr ) frame ( which assumes a solar motion of @xmath60 @xmath3  in the direction @xmath61 ) .",
    "table  [ t - datao ] gives the lsr correction ( @xmath62 ) applied for each star .",
    "we emphasize that the absolute velocity uncertainty of the stis  e140h and e230h observations is excellent with an overall precision of @xmath630.3 @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the _ fuse _  data exist for 36 of the 38 stars of the sample . the spectral resolution is far cruder ( a factor @xmath64 ) than the stis e140h ",
    "e230h resolution , with @xmath65 ( fwhm@xmath63@xmath66 @xmath3 ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the calfuse  ( ver .",
    "3.2 ) pipeline .",
    "the calfuse  processing is described in @xcite . in short ,",
    "the detector and scattered - light background were scaled and subtracted by calfuse .",
    "the extracted spectra associated with the separate exposures were aligned by cross - correlating the positions of absorption lines , and then co - added . in order to maximize the s / n , we coadded the various segments where applicable noting that we did not find any evidence for a reduction in the spectral resolution of the o@xmath0vi  absorption line",
    ". we also ensured before coadding the various segments that none was affected by fixed - pattern noise .",
    "as the _ fuse _  wavelength calibration remains uncertain , the zero point in the final _ fuse _  wavelength scale was established by shifting the average _ fuse _  velocity to the stis 140 m velocity of the same species or probing similar types of gas .",
    "for example , we compare the h@xmath67 absorption near the o@xmath0vi  @xmath361031 line to cl@xmath0i  @xmath681347 , 1379 or mg@xmath0ii  @xmath681239 , 1240 , si@xmath0ii  @xmath681304,1526 , and fe@xmath0ii  @xmath681608 , 1611 to si@xmath0ii  @xmath361020 and fe@xmath0ii  @xmath361055 .",
    "we note that the _ fuse _  relative wavelength calibration accuracy is generally better than @xmath69 @xmath3 , but in a few cases larger shifts ( up to about @xmath70 @xmath3 ) were found between the same species observed at different wavelengths .",
    "although the calfuse  version used by @xcite is different , we refer to this paper for a more detailed description of the _ fuse _  observations .",
    "we made use of two methods to analyze the data , namely the apparent optical depth ( aod ) method described by savage & sembach ( 1991 ) , and a component fitting method using the code described by fitzpatrick & spitzer ( 1997 ) . while the former method does not provide the doppler parameters ( or @xmath26-values ) , velocities , and column densities in the individual components ( assuming a maxwellian distribution ) , the aod method allows us to estimate directly the average velocities and total column densities of a given species from its absorption profile .",
    "the aod method also allows us to produce a pixel - by - pixel analysis of the absorption profiles with no prior assumption about the velocity distribution , which is valuable , e.g. , for comparing the variation of the column density ratio of two different species as a function of velocities along the line of sight .",
    "these two methods are therefore complementary .",
    "to derive the column densities and measure the velocities , we used the updated atomic parameters compiled by @xcite .",
    "the first step for analyzing an absorption profile is to define the stellar continuum level near the profile .",
    "specifically , the continua were modeled near si@xmath0iv  @xmath36@xmath361393 , 1402 , c@xmath0iv  @xmath36@xmath361548 , 1550 , n@xmath0v  @xmath36@xmath361238 , 1242 , al@xmath0iii  @xmath36@xmath361854 , 1862 , and o@xmath0vi  @xmath361031 . for comparison with tracers of cooler or less ionized gas",
    ", we also used systematically si@xmath0ii  @xmath361526 and mg@xmath0ii  @xmath361239 ( if mg@xmath0ii  was not available , we instead used s@xmath0ii  @xmath361250 or p@xmath0ii  @xmath361532 ) .",
    "si@xmath0ii  @xmath361526 is a relatively strong transition and its profile is generally saturated , allowing us to decipher the velocity interval over which the neutral and weakly ionized gas is present .",
    "the mg@xmath0ii  @xmath361239 ( or s@xmath0ii  @xmath361250 or p@xmath0ii  @xmath361301 ) absorption profiles are generally not saturated , showing the velocities where most of the neutral gas is present and allowing us to have detailed information about the component structures to compare with the high - ion profiles .",
    "each continuum was fitted by a legendre polynomial of a degree @xmath71 within @xmath72@xmath73 @xmath3  from the interstellar absorption line of interest following the methodology described in @xcite .",
    "the degree ( @xmath74 ) depended on the complexity of the stellar continuum near the absorption lines .",
    "the left panel on fig .",
    "[ f - sum ] for a given sight line in the appendix  [ s - fig ] shows the adopted continua for the n@xmath0v , c@xmath0iv , si@xmath0iv , and al@xmath0iii  lines .",
    "this figure shows that i ) in many cases the continuum was simple enough to be modeled by a low order legendre polynomial ( @xmath75 ) , and ii ) in cases where the continuum is complicated , one transition of the doublet often has a simpler continuum . in complicated cases , where the absorption was weak ,",
    "i.e. , no saturation was present ( @xmath76 ) , we used an iterative approach to fit the continuum where we transformed the absorption profile into an apparent column density ( @xmath77 ) profile ( see below and fig .",
    "[ f - sum ] ) and then check that the @xmath77 profiles for each transition of the doublet match each other . in cases where they did not , we adjusted the continuum in the most complex profile of the two transitions . in cases , where the profiles are saturated or @xmath78 , we relied on part of the profiles where @xmath79 .",
    "we emphasize that this iterative procedure represents a minority of cases ( @xmath80 of the sample ) .",
    "we also stress that for any absorption the continuum is critical for accurate results but it is even more crucial near weak transitions , such as the n@xmath0v  doublet , where a small alteration in the continuum may have a dramatic effect on the line parameters themselves ( line width , equivalent width , column density ) .",
    "hence we systematically modeled two stellar continua near the n@xmath0v  transitions that appear adequate , and if the differences in the @xmath81 and/or @xmath26 values were larger than about 40% , those are regarded uncertain .    for the o@xmath0vi  absorption",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite regarding specific issues for analyzing this absorption line , including the modeling of the continuum placement and the removal of the hd contamination .",
    "we , however , note that our independent continuum placements resulted in measurements generally overlapping within 1@xmath82 with those produced by @xcite ( see  [ s - aod ] for more details ) .",
    "we also do not show the continuum placement near the low ions , but note that generally the modeling was in most cases straightforward .",
    "we noted above that o@xmath0vi  can be contaminated by an hd line at @xmath83  .",
    "the o@xmath0vi  @xmath361031 is also surrounded by two h@xmath67 lines at 1031.557 and 1032.354  .",
    "the latter can be seen in 3 of our targets at about 120 @xmath3  ( star 16 , 17 , and 38 ) , but it does not directly contaminate the o@xmath0vi  absorption , and we therefore did not attempt to model it . the only other line that shows some possible contamination is si@xmath0iv  @xmath361393 , where at about @xmath84 @xmath3 , some weak ni@xmath0ii  @xmath361393.324 can be present .",

    "all the ions are fitted independently ( i.e. , we did not assume a common component structure for all the ions a priori ) , but both lines of the doublet are simultaneously fitted .",
    "we always started each fit with the smallest number of components that reasonably modeled the profiles , and added more components as necessary . in this manner , if the addition of a particular component did not improve the @xmath103 goodness of fit parameter , we removed that component .",
    "we allowed the software to determine the components freely ( i.e. , we did not fix any of the input parameters ) .",
    "this procedure was repeated for each profile until the best fit was achieved . in most complicated cases",

    "in general , the new results converged to the former fit .",

    ", we adopted the fit that we believed most accurately described the profiles .",
    "however , we stress that these sight lines have many components ( see table  [ t - fit ] and fig .",

    "we finally bear in mind that even though the @xmath103 goodness of fit may be good , in saturated regions of the profiles ( where the flux reaches zero ) , it is impossible to accurately model these regions because there is no way to determine the correct number of components .",
    "the resulting fit usually has one ( or very few ) component(s ) that fits the saturated region , and the column densities and @xmath26-values are unreliable .",
    "however , we emphasize that @xmath26 can not be larger in the saturated components , and therefore the estimate is a robust upper limit ( but @xmath81 directly depends on @xmath26 in the saturated regime , and hence @xmath81 can not be considered as lower limit  in that case the aod method gives a more robust lower limit ) .    the results from component fitting for al@xmath0iii , si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0iv , and n@xmath0v",
    "are given in table  [ t - fit ] , and the component models can be seen in figures  [ f - sum ] where both the individual components and global fits are shown . in total , the number of fitted components are 56 , 138 , 130 , and 24 for al@xmath0iii , si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0iv , and n@xmath0v , respectively . the lower number of fitted components for al@xmath0iii  is the result simply of a smaller sample of sight line ( 14 compared to 38 for c@xmath0iv  or si@xmath0iv ) .",
    "n@xmath0v  is not always detected , but also its absorption is generally well fitted with one ( or two ) component(s ) . if the saturated components are discarded , the numbers of components are 53 , 127 , and 129 for al@xmath0iii , si@xmath0iv , and c@xmath0iv , respectively . evidently from these numbers ,",
    "si@xmath0iv  is the most affected ion with saturation .",
    "broad components , with @xmath104 @xmath3 , may sometimes be less reliable , especially when they are blended with other components or the s / n level is not high and @xmath105 is small .",
    "for example , when the profiles are complex , a very broad component may be fitted principally to reduce the @xmath103 while several narrower components could be more adequate .",
    "we note that while each species was fitted independently , some of the components seen at similar velocities in the various species may trace similar gas ( see   [ s - match ] ) .",
    "therefore , a posteriori , we can compare the results between the high ions to further support ( or not ) the results from the profile fits . in the cases where there is some doubt",
    ", we did not revisit the fits because in order to do so we would need to alter our rule of minimum number of fitted components with no statistical improvement in the @xmath103 ( and we would actually have little constraints to define any additional components ) . in the appendix",
    "[ s - abroad ] we review some possible troublesome cases for each fitted ion .",
    "we finally emphasize that a limitation of the profile fitting ( especially in limited s / n ) and despite the use of the highest resolution available is that a broad component can be either a single broad component or a superposition of many narrower components with smaller @xmath81 , different @xmath26 , and dispersed over a certain range of velocities .",
    "this complicates the interpretation of the nature of the broad components , and as we will see later , the interpretation is model - dependent .",
    "we bear in mind this issue throughout the text , but as we will show the broad ( blended or not ) components have in any case different properties than the narrow ( unblended ) components .",

    "[ f - sum ] in the appendix  [ s - fig ] for all the profiles . in fig .",
    "[ f - aodex1 ] , we show a relatively simple example where both narrow and broad components are seen in the c@xmath0iv  and si@xmath0iv  profiles . in this case , the narrow component aligns with one of the al@xmath0iii  components while the broad component aligns with that of o@xmath0vi  and n@xmath0v .",
    "no narrow component is detected in the o@xmath0vi  or n@xmath0v  profile , and no broad component is seen in the al@xmath0iii  profile .",
    "however , not all the profiles are that simple , and in fig .",
    "[ f - aodex2 ] , we show three examples of somewhat more complicated profiles , highlighting the diversity in the high - ion profiles and their differences as a function of the @xmath46-value , i.e. , the amount of x - ray emission along the line of sight tracing the gas in prominent ob associations ( see  [ s - description ] ) .",
    "an inspection of the aod profiles allows us to outline some general properties of the high ions , but before proceeding further , we need to be more explicit in our definition of narrow and broad components .",
    "the highly ionized gas can have temperatures that are warm ( a few times @xmath106 k ) or in the transition regime ( @xmath107@xmath108 k ) .",
    "observationally , the temperature is not directly measured or estimated , but a limit can be inferred from the @xmath26-values derived from fitting the absorption profiles since @xmath26 is a function of both the thermal and nonthermal motions of the gas . assuming a maxwellian distribution , the broadening of an interstellar absorption line can be written : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the atomic weight , @xmath111 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath112 is the temperature , and @xmath113 is the nonthermal contribution to the broadening .",
    "it is therefore judicious to define a @xmath26 cutoff , @xmath114 , between broad and narrow components where the narrow components probe gas temperature of @xmath115 k in the absence of nonthermal broadening ( @xmath116 k if we assume roughly equal thermal and nonthermal contributions to the line width ) .",
    "this value , of course , varies for each species : @xmath117 @xmath3  for si@xmath0iv  and al@xmath0iii , 10 @xmath3  for c@xmath0iv , 9 @xmath3  for n@xmath0v , and 8.5 @xmath3  for o@xmath0vi . with the help of this definition , and",
    "using the above figures and more generally all the sample shown in fig .",
    "[ f - sum ] in the appendix , we can draw some apparent properties from the aod and fitted profiles :    \\1 ) narrow and broad components are widespread in the si@xmath0iv  and c@xmath0iv  profiles , but narrow components are rarely found in the profiles of n@xmath0v  or o@xmath0vi  absorption .",

    "\\3 ) the aspect of the n@xmath0v  and o@xmath0vi  aod profiles is often similar , being broad with little structure .",
    "this implies the lower resolution _ fuse _  observations of o@xmath0vi  are mostly adequate to trace the true component structure of the o@xmath0vi  absorption .",
    "this is important because there are more detections of o@xmath0vi  than n@xmath0v  so the o@xmath0vi  absorption can be reliably compared to the si@xmath0iv  and c@xmath0iv  absorption .",

    "\\5 ) in most cases , the velocity profiles of high , intermediate , and low ions are observed over similar velocity - intervals .",

    "all the saturated si@xmath0iv  components are narrow and only appear toward @xmath50 regions and o7 to o3 stars ( with one exception ) .",
    "these elements suggest that these components are associated with the environments of the o - type stars , especially since the velocities of these components are systematically blue - shifted relative to the star velocities .",
    "\\7 ) the ratios of the aod profiles for the high ions usually exhibit substantial variations as a function of velocity .",
    "this implies that several processes affect the origins of the high ions along most lines of sight .",
    "all these characteristics show that while the highly ionized absorption is complicated and the sight lines probe different regions of the milky way , some general properties can be recovered from these high resolution spectra .",
    "in particular , it seems apparent that c@xmath0iv  and si@xmath0iv  trace both the warm and transition temperature gas , while o@xmath0vi  and n@xmath0v  seem to only probe the latter type of gas . it also appears that extremely strong components of si@xmath0iv  and c@xmath0iv  arise in the stellar environment of the hottest stars . in the following sections , we explore more quantitatively these emerging properties .",
    "the inspection of the absorption profiles shows that the various high ions and al@xmath0iii   sometimes share the same components .",
    "the main aim of this section is to try to quantify this further , i.e. , we wish to know what are the fractions of matching components between al@xmath0iii , si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0iv , n@xmath0v , and o@xmath0vi .",
    "the result from this analysis informs us if these ions trace the same gas or not .",
    "we use the profile - fit results summarized in table  [ t - fit ] , comparing al@xmath0iii  ( @xmath118 ev ) with si@xmath0iv  ( @xmath119 ev ) , si@xmath0iv  with c@xmath0iv  ( @xmath120 ev ) , and c@xmath0iv  with n@xmath0v  ( @xmath121 ev ) .",
    "because o@xmath0vi  is so important for understanding the highly ionized plasma since it has the highest available @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ev ) , we also fitted the o@xmath0vi  for sight lines where n@xmath0v  is detected in order to compare these two ions ( we note our results compare to those of * ? ? ? * but we prefer to use the velocity calibration of our data for this velocity comparison ) . pairing adjacent ions on the ionization energy scale should in principle",
    "allow us to compare ions that are more likely to be found in similar gas phases .",
    "our first test is to make a velocity comparison using the central velocities of the components derived from the profile fits . in order to do this , we compared the central velocities of the respective ions , and paired the components if the velocity separation between them is less than 5 @xmath3  ( and often it is actually less than 3 @xmath3 ) .",
    "in some cases a given ion may have a broad and narrow components at a similar velocity but the compared ion has only a narrow or broad component at the same central velocity .",
    "in this case , we paired the components of the same kind ( i.e. , narrow with narrow components and broad with broad components , see below ) .",

    "the narrow components can be divided in two categories , the saturated and unsaturated components . the strong , saturated , and narrow si@xmath0iv   and c@xmath0iv  components are signatures of radiative feedback of o - type stars .",
    "the weaker narrow si@xmath0iv   and c@xmath0iv  components trace gas in the more diffuse ism that has radiatively cooled from the transition temperature phase or is photoionized by the euv radiation from cooling hot gas .",
    "the broad si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0iv , n@xmath0v , and o@xmath0vi  components trace collisionally ionized gas that is probably undergoing a cooling transition from the hot ism to the warm / cool ism .",
    "si@xmath0iv  and c@xmath0iv   have very different component behavior than al@xmath0iii  in most cases .",
    "al@xmath0iii  is likely mostly produced in the wim suggesting that si@xmath0iv  and c@xmath0iv  have different sites of origin than does al@xmath0iii . most of the observed si@xmath0iv  and c@xmath0iv   in the galactic disk does not arise in the wim very likely because the wim is strongly affected by the presence of the he@xmath0i  absorption edge at 24.6 ev in stellar atmospheres .",

    "the distributions for al@xmath0iii , si@xmath0iv , and c@xmath0iv  are skewed to higher @xmath26-values and are consistent with a lognormal distribution .",

    "the large observed range is certainly related to origins of these ions in both photoionized and cooling collisionally ionized gas .",

    "the profiles are complex and the broad components are blended with several narrower components and do not align with broad components seen in the other species . in star 20 , however , the broad al@xmath0iii  component aligns with the broad component seen at the same velocities in the high ions , giving some confidence in this result .    for si@xmath0iv , 12/138 have components with @xmath292 @xmath3 .",
    "several of the si@xmath0iv  profiles are complex , but for many of those , the broad components align with the broad components seen in other ion profiles .",

    "the s / n is quite low , and it could be possible that with better s / n , additional components may provide a better fit .    for c@xmath0iv , 35/130 have components with @xmath292 @xmath3 . as for si@xmath0iv , while many c@xmath0iv  profiles are complex , the broad components align with the broad components seen in other ion profiles , giving further support to the results of the fit . for three stars ( 27 , 29 , 37 ) ,",
    "the s / n is quite low . for star 7 , the broad component could be present to overcome some uncertainties in the continuum placement and does not align so well with the broad component seen in al@xmath0iii  or si@xmath0iv . in the spectra of stars 19 and 33 , the c@xmath0iv  profiles are complex and the broad components may be suspect as they are not evident in the profiles of other species .    for n@xmath0v ,",
    "19/24 components have @xmath292 @xmath3 .",
    "the velocity structures of the profiles are not complicated , with often just one component for the given s / n . however , as we noted in ",
    "[ s - anal ] , the n@xmath0v  absorption is often weak , and the stellar continuum near this doublet can be complicated , leading the errors to be dominated by the continuum placement .",
    "the results regarded uncertain owing to complicated stellar continua in this region of the spectrum ( see  [ s - anal ] ) are followed by colons in table  [ t - fit ] instead of formal errors .",
    "as most of our sight lines are at @xmath293 kpc ( 36 stars ) , our sample allows us to derive the volume density of a given ion that should be a good representation of the midplane density .",
    "the average volume density for each sight line is calculated by @xmath294 ( where @xmath295 is in @xmath296 and @xmath81 in @xmath86 ) , where @xmath81 is the total integrated column density , and @xmath71 is the distance to the star . as the column densities are lognormal distributed , we estimate the average and dispersion on @xmath297 .",
    "figure  [ f - avgn ] shows @xmath81 versus @xmath71 for al@xmath0iii , si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0iv , n@xmath0v , and o@xmath0vi  where the solid and dotted lines are the average volume density for the @xmath298 and @xmath47 cases .    in table  [ t - dens ] , we summarize the average volume densities of the various high ions and al@xmath0iii  ( see table  [ t - aodf ] for the individual estimate of @xmath295 ) .",
    "we consider various samples based on their @xmath46 values . as @xcite pointed out in their o@xmath0vi  survey and which apply here , neither the upper or lower limits are randomly distributed .",
    "hence the kaplan - meier estimator generally used in samples where both detection and limits are present is not adequate .",
    "we therefore treat limits as real values but for that reason we also show in this table the average values when limits are excluded . for o@xmath0vi  and c@xmath0iv ,",
    "there is only 1 upper and 1 lower limits , respectively , and therefore these samples are not really affected by the limits ( see rows 1 and 3 of table  [ t - dens ] ) .",
    "the al@xmath0iii  sample has 3 lower limits and hence is only marginally affected by the limits .",
    "however , the si@xmath0iv  sample has 8 lower limits and the n@xmath0v   sample has 8 upper limits , changing the average values by 0.2 dex .",
    "there is an evident increase in the volume densities from @xmath47 to @xmath50 to the carina nebula , implying that the stellar environments affect the production of the high ions .",
    "this effect is more notable for al@xmath0iii  and si@xmath0iv  than c@xmath0iv , n@xmath0v , and o@xmath0vi .",
    "this is not unforeseen as al@xmath0iii  and si@xmath0iv  can be more easily photoionized by hot stars .",
    "the much higher volume densities near carina are likely due to the extremely active star formation in that region , without doubt the most active region in our survey .",
    "the average densities found for al@xmath0iii , si@xmath0iv , c@xmath0iv , and o@xmath0vi  for the @xmath196 line - of - sight sample are smaller by 0.29 , 0.16 , 0.14 and 0.15 dex , respectively , than the mid - plane densities found by @xcite in their study of the extension of the high ions into the lower galactic halo .",
    "the nature of the stellar sight - line sample can strongly affect the derived values of average density .",
    "for example , @xcite estimate @xmath299o@xmath0vi@xmath300 ( stdev ) their @xmath196 sample of 42 stars with distances from 200 to 2000 pc and @xmath299o@xmath0vi@xmath301 ( stdev ) for their @xmath196 sample of 56 stars with distances @xmath302 pc .",
    "a combination of sample bias and the use of very different techniques to estimate the average density in the different studies could explain the differences among the various average density determinations found in the @xcite , @xcite , and table  [ t - dens ] of this paper ; we note that in all these cases the dispersions are quite large . the new results for n@xmath0v  in this paper",
    "could be combined with measures of n@xmath0v  column densities toward extragalactic objects to obtain an improved scale height estimate for galactic n@xmath0v .",
