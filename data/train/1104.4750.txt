    "in quantum information processing , information is stored and processed with a quantum system .",
    "a quantum system is always in contact with its surrounding environment , which leads to decoherence in the quantum system .",
    "decoherence must be suppressed for quantum information stored in qubits to be intact .",
    "there are several proposals to fight against decoherence .",
    "quantum error correction , abriviated as qec hereafter , is one of the most promising candidate to suppress environmental noise , which leads to decoherence @xcite . by adding extra ancillary qubits , in analogy with classical error correction , it is possible to encode a data qubit to an @xmath4-qubit codeword in such a way that an error which acted in the error quantum channel is identified by measuring another set of ancillary qubits added for error syndrome readout .",
    "then the correct codeword is recovered from a codeword suffering from a possible error by applying a recovery operation , whose explicit form is determined by the error syndrome readout .",
    "in contrast with the conventional scheme outlined in the previous paragraph , there is a scheme in which neither syndrome readouts nor syndrome readout ancilla qubits are required @xcite . in particular , in @xcite , a general efficient scheme was proposed .",
    "a data qubit is encoded with encoding ancilla qubits by the same encoding circuit as the conventional one , after which a noisy channel is applied on the codeword .",
    "subsequently , the inverse of the encoding circuit is applied on a codeword , which possibly suffers from an error .",
    "the resulting state is a tensor product of the data qubit state with a possible error and the ancilla qubit state .",
    "it is possible to correct erroneous data qubit state by applying correction gates with the ancilla qubits as control qubits and the data qubit as a target qubit .",
    "this paper presents two examples of error correcting codes falling in the second category .",
    "the noisy quantum channel is assumed to be fully correlated @xcite , which means all the qubits constituting the codeword are subject to the same error operators . in most physical realizations of a quantum computer ,",
    "the system size is typically on the order of a few micrometers or less , while the environmental noise , such as electromagnetic wave , has a wavelength on the order of a few millimeters or centimeters .",
    "then it is natural to assume all the qubits in the register suffer from the same error operator . to demonstrate the advantage of the second category , we restrict ourselves within the noise operators @xmath7 in the following , where @xmath3 is the number of constituent qubits in the codeword .",
    "we show that there exists an @xmath4-qubit encoding which accommodates an @xmath5-qubit data state if @xmath4 is odd and an @xmath6-qubit date state if @xmath4 is even .",
    "although the channel is somewhat artificial as an error channel , we may apply our error correction scheme in the following situation .",
    "suppose alice wants to send qubits to bob .",
    "their qubit bases differ by unitary operations @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "even when they do not know which basis the other party employs , the can correctly send qubits by adding one extra qubits ( when @xmath4 is odd ) or two extra qubits ( when @xmath4 is even ) .    we state the theorems and prove them in the next section .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "in the following , @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11th component of the pauli matrices and we take the basis vectors @xmath12 so that @xmath13 is diagonalized .",
    "we introduce operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 acting on the @xmath4-qubit space @xmath16 , where @xmath3 as mentioned before .",
    "let @xmath17 be @xmath18 complex matrices , and let @xmath19",
    ". denote by @xmath20 the ( joint ) rank-@xmath21 numerical range of @xmath22 , which is the collection of @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for some @xmath18 rank-@xmath21 orthogonal projection @xmath25 @xcite . a quantum channel of the form @xmath26 has a @xmath21-dimensional quantum error correcting code ( qecc ) if and only if @xmath27 .",
    "to prove this statement , we need to recall the knill - laflamme correctability condition , which asserts that given a quantum channel @xmath28 with error operators @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a qecc of @xmath31 if and only if @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the projection operator with the range space @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "it should be clear that @xmath34 if and only if there is a qecc with dimension @xmath21 .",
    "now it follows from @xmath35 and the relations @xmath36 when @xmath4 is even and @xmath37 when @xmath4 is odd that the channel ( [ eq : corrch ] ) has a @xmath21-dimensional qecc if and only if @xmath38 by noting that @xmath39 irrespective of rank  @xmath25 , we find @xmath40 if and only if @xmath41 .",

    "_    since @xmath67 is a commuting family , @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "we may assume that @xmath68 since @xmath69 , we have @xmath70    let us show that @xmath71 .",
    "we first note the identity @xmath72 for hermitian @xmath73 .",
    "let us replace @xmath74 by @xmath75 and @xmath76 by @xmath77 to obtain @xmath78 .",

    "since each eigenvalue has multiplicity @xmath81 , each convex hull involves at least three eigenvalues . by inspecting four eigenvalues plotted in the complex plane",
    ", we easily find the intersection of all the convex hulls is a single point @xmath85 , which proves @xmath71 .",
