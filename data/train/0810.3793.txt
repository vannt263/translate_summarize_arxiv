    "the maximum luminosities reached ( 35@xmath3ergs@xmath4 ) are factors of 1020 higher than those of the @xmath310m@xmath7 black - hole x - ray binaries studied in our galaxy , pushing the limits of the current supercritical accretion models and requiring very high beaming / collimation .",
    "the most likely black - hole masses are probably around 4060m@xmath7 in the case of x1 , and 80500m@xmath7 in the case of x2 , although most of the arguments for such high masses come from the thermal components of the spectral fits , which could be unreliable .",

    "the authors suggest that this is compatible with a @xmath311m@xmath7 mass black hole , where the accretion disk is colder ( 0.20.4kev ) and the inner parts of the accretion flow are in the form of an outflow or a comptonizing corona , which is responsible for the power - law emission .",
    "the current data , despite its high photon statistics , is insufficient to distinguish between different scenarios without the assumption of a specific theoretical model ( e.g. , power - law emission with or without contribution from the accretion disk and intrinsic absorption ) followed by a targeted interpretation of the results .",
    "higher s / n x - ray spectra and better constraints on the short term variability of x1 , as well as better theoretical understanding of the most luminous ulxs ( which will allow us to select the proper theoretical models to fit ) , will allow us to distinguish those scenarios in the future .",
    "it is reassuring that despite our different interpretations of the x - ray spectra of x1 , we reach similar conclusions about the possible black hole mass of x1 .",
    "the optical counterpart of x2 , a luminous hii region in the spiral arm of ngc1365 , is the most likely place to find an imbh  both in terms of formation mechanisms for imbhs , which require very dense environments , and in terms of the availability and capture of a suitable donor star to supply the accretion material .",
    "the lack of an optical counterpart of x1 makes the association with an imbh more problematic , but not implausible ; recent theoretical work suggests that for primordial imbhs ( one of three possible formation mechanisms , all of which require a dense environment ) , most imbhs with masses @xmath312m@xmath7 would be ejected from the dense globular cluster where they formed @xcite .",
    "consequently , the lack of an optical counterpart for x1 does not automatically preclude an imbh primary .",

    "<S> we present 26 point - sources discovered with chandra within @xmath0 ( @xmath1kpc ) of the center of the barred supergiant galaxy ngc1365 . </S>",
    "<S> the majority of these sources are high - mass x - ray binaries , containing a neutron star or a black hole accreting from a luminous companion at a sub - eddington rate . using repeat chandra and xmm - newton as well as optical observations , we discuss in detail the natures of two highly - variable ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) : , one of the most luminous ulxs known since the _ rosat _ era , which is x - ray variable by a factor of 30 , and , a newly discovered transient ulx , variable by a factor of @xmath290 . </S>",
    "<S> their maximum x - ray luminosities ( 35@xmath3ergs@xmath4 , measured with _ chandra _ ) and multiwavelength properties suggest the presence of more exotic objects and accretion modes : accretion onto intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) and beamed / super - eddington accretion onto solar - mass compact remnants . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these two sources have black - hole masses higher than those of the typical primaries found in x - ray binaries in our galaxy ( which have masses of ) , with a likely black - hole mass of in the case of with a beamed / super - eddington accretion mode , and a possible imbh in the case of with . </S>"
