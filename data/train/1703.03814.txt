    "however , we can use the deep multi - wavelength photometry available in zfourge  to construct composite seds @xcite and analyze the faint stellar continuum of a sample of emission - line objects at @xmath0 .",
    "we will refer to the most intense of these compact , [ ] -emitting galaxies , as extreme emission line galaxies ( eelgs ) , and galaxies with less intense , but still significant [ ]  emission as strong emission line galaxies ( selgs ) for the duration of the letter .",

    "the emission lines fall into the @xmath1-band in the redshift range @xmath3 , and this excess flux in the @xmath1-band increases our confidence in the photometric redshifts , which are in strong agreement with the handful of spectroscopic redshifts available for this population .",

    "one of the objects in our eelg sample is the subject of s16 , which analyzes a rest - frame optical spectrum from mosfire .",
