    "high - resolution x - ray images from the chandra x - ray observatory and xmm - newton elucidate all stages in the life cycles of massive stars  from ultracompact hii ( uchii ) regions to supernova remnants  and the effects that those massive stars have on their surroundings .",
    "x - ray studies of massive star - forming regions ( msfrs ) thus give insight into the massive stars themselves , the accompanying lower - mass cluster population , new generations of stars that may be triggered by the massive cluster , interactions of massive star winds with themselves and with the surrounding neutral medium , and the fate of massive stars that die as cavity supernovae inside the wind - blown bubbles they created .    in the era of _ spitzer _ and excellent ground - based near - infrared ( ir ) data ,",

    "_ chandra _ routinely penetrates @xmath0  mag of extinction with little confusion or contamination , revealing young stellar populations in a manner that is unbiased by the presence of inner disks around these stars . these vast pre - main sequence",
    "( pre - ms ) populations are easily seen by _",
    "chandra _ and the @xmath1 imaging array of its advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - i ) ; a typical acis - i observation of a nearby ( @xmath2  kpc ) msfr , lasting 40100 ksec , finds 5001500 young stars , tracing the initial mass function ( imf ) down to @xmath3m@xmath4 .",
    "these observations can increase the number of known cluster members by as much as a factor of 50 in poorly - studied regions ( e.g.ngc  6357 , * ? ? ?",
    "in the first 7 months of 2006 , at least 18 refereed papers on x - ray observations of msfrs ( using _ chandra _ or _ xmm _ ) were published or submitted .",
    "these include studies of 30  doradus @xcite , ngc  6334 @xcite , @xmath5 orionis @xcite , westerlund  1 @xcite , rcw  38 @xcite , cepheus  b / ob3b @xcite , ngc  6357 @xcite , m17 @xcite , ngc  2362 @xcite , ngc  2264 @xcite , trumpler 16 in carina @xcite , ngc  6231 @xcite , the orion nebula cluster @xcite , the arches and quintuplet clusters @xcite , and w49a @xcite .",
    "early _ chandra _ and _ xmm _ studies were summarized in @xcite ; more recent work is described in @xcite .",
    "other msfrs currently under study at penn state include rcw  49 @xcite , ngc  7538 @xcite , w51a @xcite , and the rosette nebula ( wang et al.2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "this contribution begins with recent x - ray results on the young msfrs m17 and ngc  3576 , two regions at different evolutionary stages but with notably similar outflows of hot , x - ray - emitting gas .",
    "next i introduce a new acis mosaic of the westerhout 3 complex , showing how triggered star formation in the same molecular cloud can result in very different stellar clusters .",
    "then i address the rich and complicated point source and diffuse x - ray emission seen towards trumpler  14 in carina .",
    "finally i provide a first look at a new _ chandra _ observation of 30 doradus obtained in early 2006 .",
    "the omega nebula ( m17 ) is the second - brightest hii region in the sky ( after the orion nebula ) .",
    "its ob cluster ngc  6618 probably has well over 5000 members , extending up to masses @xmath6 ( spectral type o4v+o4v ) in its central binary .",
    "it is situated at the edge of one of the galaxy s most massive and dense molecular cloud cores , m17sw , at a distance of 1.6  kpc @xcite .",
    "it is a blister hii region viewed nearly edge - on , on the periphery of a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) containing an uchii region with uv - excited water masers and active star formation .",
    "the ionization front of the hii region encounters the gmc along two photodissociation regions , called the northern and southern bars . with an age of @xmath7  myr @xcite and no evolved stars ,",
    "m17 is one of the few bright msfrs that has sufficient stellar wind power to produce an x - ray outflow and yet is unlikely to have hosted any supernovae .",
    "we observed m17 s central cluster ngc  6618 with _ chandra_/acis - i for 40  ksec in march 2002 .",
    "the extensive soft diffuse emission seen in m17 is rare ; it was described by @xcite and is shown in figure  [ fig : m17_xray_ir ] .",
    "the 877 point sources detected in this observation are described , catalogued , and compared to ir data by @xcite .",
    "fewer than 10% of these point sources ( in m17 and in the other galactic msfrs described here ) are unrelated to the msfr ( foreground stars and background agn , * ? ? ?",
    "_ chandra _ has a point spread function ( psf ) that is sub - arcsecond on - axis , but degrades radially to become many arcseconds wide at the field edge .",
    "this effect is apparent in figure  [ fig : m17_xray_ir ] and in other acis images shown in this paper .",
    "[ fig : m17_xray_ir ]    figure  [ fig : m17_xray_ir ] ( right ) shows the 5.8@xmath8 m glimpse image of m17 from the spitzer space telescope s infrared array camera ( irac ) .",
    "the early _ chandra _ and _ spitzer _ images in figure  [ fig : m17_xray_ir ] show dramatic and complex interacting components of hot and cold material .",
    "on the western side of the cluster , the parsec - scale thermalized o - star winds shock the parental gmc , triggering new massive star formation to the southwest . to the east , the winds escape the confinement of the blister hii region producing the brightest known x - ray champagne flow , heating and chemically enriching the ism @xcite .",
    "[ fig : m17_o4_stars ]    _ chandra s _ strongly - varying psf and the acis - i camera s large field of view also make it difficult to convey the sub - arcsecond imaging quality in full - field smoothed images .",

    "the soft plasma components in these o4 stars are of similar strength and are typical of o stars ; they are thought to be due to microshocks in the powerful stellar winds . both of these sources ,",
    "however , show very hard thermal plasmas as well ; the brighter o4 star s spectrum is dominated by this hard component .",
    "a reasonable explanation for this hard emission is that it comes from colliding winds in an as - yet - unrecognized close binary system .",
    "since both o4 stars exhibit this hard emission , it is possible that the o4+o4 binary actually consists of no fewer than 4 massive components .",
    "ngc  3576 is a galactic giant hii region , located at a distance of 2.8  kpc @xcite .",
    "it contains several known o and early b stars but these are not sufficient to account for the ly@xmath12 ionizing photons inferred from radio data @xcite .",
    "an embedded massive ir star cluster is located at the edge of its gmc @xcite .",
    "it contains at least 51 stars earlier than a0 , most with large ir excesses .",
    "it likely includes as yet unrecognized o stars that would account for the number of ly@xmath12 photons .",
    "a radio study of ngc  3576 @xcite revealed a large north - south velocity gradient in the ionized gas of the nebula , indicating a large - scale ionized outflow .",
    "this flow may contribute to the large loops and filaments seen in visual data ( figure  [ fig:3576_vis_ir ] , left ) .",
    "the 8@xmath8 m _ msx _ image ( figure  [ fig:3576_vis_ir ] , right ) is complementary to the visual data , revealing heavy obscuration in the southern half of the field and what appears to be a bipolar bubble likely blown by the massive stars in ngc  3576 s central cluster .",
    "this bubble appears closed to the south , where it encounters the dense gmc , but open to the north , in the same direction as the large visual loops .",
    "[ fig:3576_vis_ir ]    in july 2005 we obtained a 60-ksec acis observation of ngc  3576 , to see if a soft x - ray bubble suggested by the _ rosat _ data was indicating that ngc  3576 possessed an x - ray outflow similar to that seen in m17 .",
    "the acis aimpoint was directed at the strong infrared source irs  1 , at the core of the embedded young stellar cluster , to search for embedded protostars and the stellar sources responsible for ionizing ngc  3576 , as well as to resolve the brightest flaring pre - ms stars .",
    "our acis field here is similar to that for m17 : only part of the bubble seen by _ rosat _ is captured .",
    "it was important to keep the aimpoint on irs  1 , though , to study the embedded population and the ir cluster , which hold the key to understanding the source of the _ rosat _ bubble .",
    "figure  [ fig:3576_acis ] ( left ) shows that this observation indeed reveals the massive stellar engine powering ngc  3576 , shredding the molecular cloud from which it formed .",
    "many sources not known even from mid - ir studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are seen in x - rays .",
    "the brightest of these is a hard , deeply - embedded source @xmath13 south of irs1 .",
    "this and other new x - ray sources may be the long - sought embedded massive stars providing the extra ionization for ngc  3576 .",
    "much of the x - ray bubble seen by _ rosat _ is resolved by _",
    "chandra _ into a wide array of point sources distributed across the field .",
    "diffuse x - rays remain , however , near the top of the acis field and in a more concentrated patch southeast of the central cluster . comparing the smoothed acis image ( figure  [ fig:3576_acis ] , right ) to the visual and mid - ir data in figure  [ fig:3576_vis_ir ] , it appears that the northern visual loops outline ( at least in part ) soft diffuse x - ray emission in and beyond the northern , more open lobe of the bipolar bubble . throughout the field",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission is complementary to the mid - ir emission , suggesting either that warm dust has displaced the hot x - ray gas or that this material is shadowing the x - rays , absorbing and obscuring any soft x - ray emission that may lie behind it .",
    "the southern lobe is also traced by soft diffuse x - ray gas ; the lack of shadowing here implies that this part of the wind - blown bubble lies on the near side of the gmc .",
    "there are clear relationships between ngc  3576 s x - ray plasma , velocity and temperature gradients measured in the radio , the impressive visual loops , and the mid - ir bipolar bubble .",
    "spectral analysis of this diffuse x - ray emission is ongoing and should give some insight into the energetics of this important complex .",
    "[ fig:3576_acis ]    _ chandra _ has revealed that ngc  3576 and m17 are two examples of the same phenomenon , although ngc  3576 s cluster is younger and more deeply embedded in its natal cloud , leading to the more complex spatial morphology in its soft diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "it appears that hot , flowing x - ray gas from ob winds may be a common component of young blister hii regions , strongly affecting their morphology and dynamics .",
    "w3 is a large , nearby ( @xmath14  kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) msfr in the perseus arm of the milky way .",
    "the w3 complex contains one of the most massive molecular clouds in the outer galaxy @xcite , massive embedded protostars @xcite , near- and mid - ir sources @xcite , masers , and outflows .",
    "it is unique in containing all morphological classes of hii region , from hypercompact to diffuse , 0.01 to 1  pc in diameter , with ages @xmath15@xmath16  yrs @xcite .",
    "many authors have argued that star formation in w3 is being induced by the expansion of the adjacent w4 superbubble , which is sweeping up molecular gas into a high - density layer , within which stars are forming .",
    "@xcite revised this scenario , proposing that the young ( 35 myr ) ob cluster ic  1795 , triggered to form by w4 , is blowing its own second - generation superbubble at the molecular cloud interface , triggering in turn the w3 complex of massive star formation .",
    "w3 is an ideal testbed for understanding recent , ongoing , and triggered star formation ; x - ray sources there are all at the same distance yet exist in a range of dynamical settings , providing a series of controlled environments in which to study the violent interactions of massive stars with their natal cloud .    with many observations throughout 2005 , used acis - i to image the three major star - forming complexes , w3 north , w3 main , and w3(oh ) , amassing @xmath17  ksec on each field .",

    ". however figure  [ fig : w3_soft - hard ] clearly reveals that w3 north is not an orion - like field ; no cluster of young x - ray - emitting pre - ms stars is seen .",
    "this may indicate that the region has an anomalous imf , that this o6 star is a young example of a massive star that formed in isolation @xcite , or that the o6 star is a runaway from either ic  1795 or w3  main that has somehow managed to create a large and complex hii region at the edge of w3 s high - density layer . in any case , this is an unusual situation that merits more detailed study .",
    "w3  main harbors the strongest co peak in w3 and ir clusters with over 200 stars @xcite .",
    "an early 40-ksec acis - i observation showed possible extended emission spatially coincident with the hii regions ; over 100 of the 236 acis sources detected in this original dataset are near the w3 core @xcite .",
    "we added another 40 ksec to this original observation ; in the composite image , it is clear that w3 main is the dominant star - forming center of w3 , with an extensive population of young stars nearly filling the @xmath1 acis - i field of view .",
    "the full extent of w3 main was not clear from earlier ir studies . of the @xmath18 sources in the w3 acis mosaic , over half of them",

    "irs5 is thought to be a multiple system of perhaps five proto - ob stars @xcite .",
    "we do nt resolve the components with acis , but we do find a very hard spectrum for the x - ray source coincident with irs5 , again consistent with colliding - wind binary emission , although this hard emission could be coming from a cluster wind generated by the combined effects of the winds from all of these massive protostars @xcite .",

    "high ism velocities throughout the complex @xcite and the presence of evolved stars may imply that a supernova might already have occurred in this region , although no well - defined remnant has ever been seen .",
    "tr14 is an extremely rich , young ( @xmath221  my ) , compact ob cluster near the center of the carina complex , containing at least 30 o and early b stars @xcite .",

    "although star formation has ceased in the keyhole region of carina due to the harsh environment created by the massive stars there , the proximity of tr14 to the gmc has triggered a new generation of star formation in carina i @xcite .    in september 2004",
    "we obtained a 57-ksec acis - i observation of tr14 ( figure  [ fig : tr14_images ] ) .",
    "the aimpoint of this observation is the central star in the cluster , hd  93129ab , a very early - type ( o2i  o3.5v ) binary @xcite , with the two components separated by @xmath23 .",
    "our acis - i observation reveals @xmath221600 x - ray point sources in the tr14 region , suffused by bright , soft diffuse emission . since the tr16 and tr14 clusters overlap , some sources toward the east and southeast are most likely tr16 members ; a few sources in the northeast corner of our field may be members of the nearby tr15 cluster .",
    "the soft diffuse emission pervading the eastern half of our field is sharply cut off to the west by the gmc .",
    "the density of x - ray point sources also falls sharply to the west , due in part to reduced sensitivity because of higher extinction and in part because star formation is just now being triggered in that region , as described above .",

    "the brightest source near field center is hd93129a ; it is clearly resolved from hd93129b ( seen slightly to the southeast ) and from another , fainter star just to its south ( west of hd93129b ) .",
    "the acis spectra of these early o stars are shown in figure  [ fig : tr14_ptsrcs ] ( right panel ) .",
    "although these two stars are of similar early spectral type , they show remarkably different x - ray spectra . while both exhibit the expected soft thermal plasma with @xmath24  kev , hd93129a also requires a second , harder thermal component and is 7 times brighter in x - rays than hd93129b .",
    "we find similar results for other o stars in the field : while the o3v star hd93128 is soft ( @xmath25  kev ) and faint ( absorption - corrected luminosity @xmath26  ergs / s ) , the o3v star hd93250 is the brightest source in the acis field , with @xmath27  ergs / s and requiring both soft ( @xmath28  kev ) and hard ( @xmath29  kev ) thermal plasma components . as for other sources described above , this leads us to speculate that hd93129a and hd93250 could be colliding - wind binaries ; alternatively the hard components of their spectra are soft enough that they could be magnetically active early o stars , similar to @xmath30  ori  c @xcite .",
    "in contrast , hd93129b and hd93128 are likely more `` normal '' o stars without these phenomena .",

    "this diffuse emission is brightest in the southeast quadrant , in the region between tr14 and tr16 .",
    "surprisingly , it is not centered on the tr14 cluster .",

    "we serendipitously imaged very bright diffuse emission in the off - axis acis - s ccds that were also operational for this observation .",
    "this emission is far from the known massive stars in the carina complex .",
    "although its apparent surface brightness is much higher than the diffuse emission seen on the acis - i array , it is intrinsically fainter ; we see it as brighter because it suffers no measurable absorption .",
    "this may indicate that it lies in front of the tr14 cluster , perhaps partially filling the lower lobe of the carina superbubble seen in the mid - ir .",
    "[ fig : tr14_diffuse ]    while both regions of diffuse emission exhibit soft spectra ( figure  [ fig : tr14_diffuse ] ) , they require quite different model fits .",
    "the emission in the southeast quadrant of the i array requires a two - temperature fit ( @xmath25  kev and @xmath28  kev ) , some absorption , and typical low abundances of @xmath31 .",
    "the s array emission requires just a single thermal component with @xmath32  kev , but no absorbing column is seen and a good fit is only obtained by increasing the abundances of ne and fe , possibly indicating a supernova origin for this emission .",
    "earlier x - ray data suggested that the carina complex is pervaded by diffuse x - ray emission not concentrated on the star clusters .",
    "this detailed view from _ chandra _ now shows that the diffuse emission is spatially and spectrally complex and , while it may be due in part to massive star winds , one or more cavity supernovae probably also contribute to its complexity .",
