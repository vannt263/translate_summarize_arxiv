    "the large computational requirements of lattice qcd coupled with the enormous cost / performance advantages that can be obtained with specially configured computer hardware have encouraged the design and construction of a variety of purpose - built machines over the past nearly 18 years .",
    "the _ qcdsp _",
    "machines now being completed by our collaboration@xcite represent a continued development in this direction .",
    "the most recent , 12,288-node machine at the riken brookhaven research center has a construction cost of approximately $ 1.8 m and a peak speed of 0.6tflops or a cost per peak performance of $ 3/mflops . at present , our most efficient routine inverts the wilson dirac operator . a complete program which carries out a wilson - fermion",
    ", hybrid monte carlo evolution achieves about 25% efficiency on a lattice volume of @xmath0 sites per node which corresponds to a dollar per delivered mflops figure of $ 13.6/mflops@xcite .    achieving this level of performance required considerable care when writing the routine which applies the wilson dirac operator to a spinor field .",
    "( we expect that with more effort , this efficiency may increase somewhat further and that our staggered code will achieve a similar level of performance . )",
    "this high performance code is written in assembly language and uses many of the special hardware features provided to boost efficiency .",
    "however , the bulk of the conjugate gradient code which applies this dirac operator , as well as the hybrid monte carlo evolution which uses the conjugate gradient inverter , is written in @xmath1 and can be relatively easily understood and modified .",
    "thus , this 25% efficiency is achieved in a `` user friendly '' , @xmath1 physics software environment in which the carefully coded , high - performance routines are easily called by the high - level code ",
    "code which is no more difficult to write than that in a more standard environment .",
    "we have now completed _ qcdsp _ machines at four of the five sites listed in table  [ tab : machines ] .",
    "the machine at the riken brookhaven research center is now completely assembled , successfully runs our basic diagnostic code and is in a final debugging mode .",
    "the machines at the other four locations have been running production code for a number of months . in particular , the 8,192-node machine at columbia ( fig .",
    "[ fig:128 mb ] ) has been running quite reliably in production mode since april 1998 .",
    "there is a hardware failure roughly every two weeks which can usually be repaired by simply replacing a faulty daughter board , although on occasion more subtle errors need to be diagnosed .",
    "we anticipate that even this error rate will decrease as a period of infant mortality passes .    0.1 in = 2.9 in -.2 in    -0.3 in    ",
    ".locations of the five installed_qcdsp _ machines . [ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]",
    "during the past year , we have gone from operating up to eight motherboards in an air cooled crate to much larger machines composed of many cabinets for which water cooling is supplied . in order to allow the dense stacking of the 8-motherboard crates within these larger machines",
    ", we have arranged a water cooled , heat absorber below the fan tray that blows cooling air through each individual crate .",
    "the introduction of water cooling has caused some problems .",
    "the room humidity must be controlled to avoid condensation on the cold piping within the machine . with this internally - provided cooling ,",
    "these large computers become essentially decoupled from the cooling and safety systems routinely provided in the larger room housing the machine . as a result",
    ", we have installed temperature- and smoke - sensitive safety systems in the large machines at both columbia and brookhaven .",
    "the earlier computers at columbia were each configured as a single large machine and used to tackle large , demanding problems that typically had been previous explored on smaller machines .",
    "however , we are now able to exploit the easily configurable character of the _ qcdsp _ architecture , to adjust the hardware arrangement to support a variety of physics goals stretching from initial studies of dynamical domain - wall fermion thermodynamics on small , @xmath2 lattices on 128-node , 6.4gflops machines ( we are presently running @xmath3 such machines ) to a continuation of a large , @xmath4 , 2 and 4 staggered fermion calculation on 2 or 3 2048-node , 100gflops machines .",
    "as our physics objectives mature , we expect to assemble even larger units , ultimately running the most demanding problems on a single machine composed of perhaps 50 - 75% of all available hardware .",
    "our 8,192 machine is presently running as 17 separate computers on a wide range of lattices .",
    "now we turn to a brief discussion of future machines . in order to keep the discussion reasonably concrete ,",
    "let us consider the design of a machine intended to sustain 2.0tflops on a @xmath5 lattice .",
    "we assume that there will be demanding , full qcd calculations that require a single large machine be used to thermalize and evolve a single , relatively small lattice .",
    "our performance estimates are based on those in @xcite .",
    "two sets of curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : perf ] .",
    "the right - hand family shows the number of processors required to sustain 2tflops as a function of network bandwidth on a @xmath6 lattice for preconditioned wilson fermions and three different processor speeds . for comparison , the curves on the left correspond to a 150gflops machine with slower individual processors .",
    "( for simplicity the effects of communication latency have been ignored in this figure . )    for fixed speed processors and a fixed size problem , the number of required processors falls as increasing bandwidth increases the over - all efficiency of the machine . finally ,",
    "when the communication time falls below that required for the floating point portion of calculation , the curve flattens and no longer depends on bandwidth .",
    "the solid square corresponds to 4k , 0.5gflops - sustained processors with a 1gbit network bandwidth available to each processor  a machine that might be constructed from standard workstation and network subsystems in a couple of years .",
    "however , including modest @xmath7sec network latency will lower the sustained speed of this machine by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "the solid triangle represents 16k , 0.15gflops - sustained processors with 0.64gbit network bandwidth , a natural evolution of our _ qcdsp _ architecture with @xmath8 enhanced network .",
    "finally the solid circle shows the 0.15tflops sustained riken / bnl machine .",
    "-0.9 in = 3.3 in -1.1 in    -0.3 in    this suggests that available technology should permit either style of qcd - machine to be constructed .",
    "in deciding between these two approaches one must compare the benefits of a standard processor / workstation architecture to the significant cost advantages achieved with a custom design .",
    "it is likely that a combination of the best of both approaches will be possible .",
    "this meeting marks the completion of the current set of _ qcdsp _ machines under construction .",
    "we now look forward to a number of years during which these significant resources will be used to increase our understanding of both qcd and quantum field theory .",
