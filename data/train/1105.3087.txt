    "extra dimensions have been proposed as an alternative way to address the origin of the large scale discrepancy between planck scale and electroweak scale , known as hierarchy problem @xcite .",

    "this would lead to rapid proton decay and unacceptable flavor violation .",

    "we see that if the scale @xmath3 is large , this decay mode may still constrain the radion masses . for example , at @xmath208 level if @xmath209 tev , we found that the radion mass must be larger than 1.3 gev .",

    "the radion coupling to the fermions is proportional to the fermion mass .",
    "the dominant production mode for the radion at lhc is through gluon fusion .",
    "the radion has an enhanced coupling with gluons through the trace anomaly @xcite : l_int =   t_^,with @xmath220 defined as t_^= ( f^a_f^a )  , where @xmath221 is the field strength tensor of @xmath222    = 3.5 in    interactions and @xmath223 is the qcd beta - function coefficient defined as @xmath224 additional contributions coming from the heavy quark loop diagram is suppressed and neglecting that , the cross section of radion production through gluon fusion at lhc can be written as @xmath225 where @xmath226 , @xmath227 being the number of quark flavors .",

    "for a radion of mass @xmath2 and the center of mass energy @xmath230 we define @xmath231 .",
    "we calculate the total leading order cross section for the radion production at lhc for two different center - of mass energies , 7 tev and 14 tev as a function of the mass of the radion ( @xmath2 ) with @xmath232 tev and is shown in fig .",

    "thus if we reduce @xmath3 by a factor 2 then the cross section is increased by a factor of 4 .",
    "we have already shown that flavor physics constrains the parameter space with lower bounds obtained on the radion mass for @xmath4 tev .",
    "for a 100 gev radion , @xmath3 can be as low as 300 gev which implies a cross section of @xmath235 710 pb for the radion production at lhc with @xmath236 tev .",
    "for radion of mass less than 100 gev , there are additional constraints on @xmath3 from lep data @xcite .",

    "although the first three channels dominate the radion decay @xcite , one can try to search for flavor violating radion decays through the leptonic decay modes .",
    "the large cross section for the radion production can give significant events for the alternative decay channels ( @xmath241 ) which will have smaller sm background .",
    "therefore , they could be striking signatures for radion search at the lhc . however , the leptonic branchings of the radion are very suppressed and fall rapidly with increasing radion mass . the flavor violating leptonic decay channels ( @xmath242 )",
    "are further suppressed with branching probabilities even smaller than the diphoton channel and is of the order of @xmath196 for light radion of mass less than 100 gev .",
    "the @xmath243 decay channel is about 5% for a 50 gev radion and @xmath244 gev . with a good @xmath199-id at lhc",
    ", this can be an important channel for the light radion signal at lhc .",
    "for a heavier radion with mass greater than the top mass , the radion can decay to a top - quark and charm quark .",
    "this probability peaks for a 250 gev radion and has a branching probability of @xmath245% . for values as low as @xmath246 gev , this can give a @xmath23520% contribution to the single top production which is about @xmath247 pb in sm at lhc with @xmath236 tev . with the knowledge of the radion mass and with dedicated cuts to isolate the signal from the background this mode can give hint to flavor violating decay of the radion @xcite .",
    "it will be however impossible to see any significant effects of flavor violation in the leptonic sector at lhc in the atlas and cms experiments from radion production .",
    "the heavy radion would most likely be seen through its decays to the weak gauge bosons ( @xmath248 gev ) while the @xmath199 mode looks to be significant for the lighter radion .",
    "we refer the reader to various detailed studies on radion signals at colliders @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the flavor violation in warped extra dimension due to the radion exchange . in this scenario ,",
    "the sm fermions are propagating in the 5d bulk and the higgs is localized on the tev brane .",
    "we found that @xmath249 and @xmath250 lead to strong constraints on radion mass , @xmath2 and the scale @xmath3 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath4 tev , one finds that @xmath251 implies that @xmath6 gev .",

    "we have shown that the @xmath255 imposes a stringent limit on the scale @xmath3 for @xmath256 gev .",

    "we have also analyzed the search for radion at lhc .",
    "although , we do not find any significant flavor violating signals in the lepton sector , there is definitely a possibility of contributions to single top cross section with the radion decaying through the flavor violating mode of @xmath258 .",
