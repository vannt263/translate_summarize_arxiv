    "diffraction and interference of matter are among the most fascinating and controversial aspects of quantum theory .",
    "it is not surprising that laboratory exploration of these phenomena with subatomic , atomic , and molecular particles has been at the heart of experimental research since early days of quantum mechanics @xcite . as of today ,",
    "a wave - like behavior of matter has been successfully demonstrated for a number of elementary particles , atoms , simple molecules ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) , and , most notably , for some heavy organic compounds including c@xmath0 @xcite , c@xmath1 @xcite , and c@xmath0f@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a majority of these experiments involve sending a mono - energetic beam of particles through a screen with openings ( apertures ) such as slits , diffraction gratings , or fresnel zone plates .",
    "mathematically , the problem of quantum diffraction on stationary spatial apertures can be described by the poisson equation and treated by methods originally developed in the context of diffraction and interference of light @xcite .    a diffraction phenomenon of a different kind ",
    "`` diffraction in time ''  was introduced by moshinsky six decades ago @xcite and subsequently studied by many researchers , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the phenomenon has to do with time evolution ( more precisely , with non - uniform spreading ) of initially sharp wave fronts in quantum systems , and manifests itself already in one dimension .",
    "thus , in the original set - up proposed by moshinsky @xcite , a perfectly absorbing shutter is placed in the way of a mono - energetic beam of non - relativistic quantum particles .",
    "then , a sudden removal of the shutter creates a `` chopped '' particle beam with a sharp wave front .",
    "as shown by moshinsky , such a wave front disperses non - uniformly in the course of time and , most interestingly , develops a sequence of diffraction fringes .",
    "mathematically , these fringes appear to be analogous to the ones observed in diffraction of light on the edge of a semi - infinite plane .",
    "there are several ways of treating quantum diffraction theoretically .",
    "one commonly used , physically motivated method for evaluating the wave function of a quantum particle passing through an opening in a diffraction screen is the `` truncation '' approximation , which is based on the composition property of quantum propagators . in this approximation ,",
    "transmission of a spatially localized wave packet through the diffraction screen is treated as a three stage process : ( i ) the wave packet is propagated freely during the time that it takes the corresponding classical particle to reach the screen , then ( ii ) the wave function is reshaped ( or truncated ) in accordance with the geometry of the aperture , and , finally , ( iii ) the resultant wave function is propagated freely for the remaining time interval . the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for details and implementation examples of the truncation approximation .",
    "one drawback of the truncation approximation is that it does not account for diffraction in time .",
    "brukner and zeilinger @xcite proposed another , more versatile method for solving the problem of quantum diffraction .",
    "the central assumption of their method is that the time - dependent wave function in question satisfies certain explicitly known , inhomogeneous time - dependent dirichlet boundary conditions at the surface of the diffraction screen .",
    "more specifically , two assumptions are made : ( i ) the value of the wave function at a point inside the aperture is assumed to equal the value that the wave function would have at this point if the diffraction screen was absent , and ( ii ) the wave function vanishes at every point of the diffraction screen outside the aperture . the first assumption is commonly referred to as the kirchhoff approximation , while the second corresponds to the physical assumption of _ perfect reflectivity _ of the screen .",
    "the method of brukner and zeilinger has since been successfully used by several researchers to study quantum diffraction in both space and time @xcite .    in this paper , we present another approach to quantum diffraction in space and time .",
    "our method is based on the huygens - fresnel principle and kirchhoff theory of diffraction , and allows one to calculate the time - dependent quantum propagator for the problem of particle diffraction on spatio - temporal openings in otherwise _ perfectly absorbing _ screens .",
    "our expression for the propagator is especially adaptable for calculating diffraction patterns in situations in which the initial wave function is given by a spatially localized wave packet or by a superposition of several localized wave packets .",
    "similar to the method of brukner and zeilinger , our construction provides a unified framework that treats the phenomena of diffraction in space and diffraction in time on the same footage .",
    "the main difference between the method of brukner and zeilinger and our method is that the former is designed to treat perfectly reflecting screens , while the latter is only applicable to perfectly absorbing ones .",
    "finally , our approach allows for calculation of quantum diffraction patterns produced by openings in spatially curved screens .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theor ] we develop an expansion of the propagator for a non - relativistic quantum particle passing through a time - dependent opening in an absorbing screen . in sec .",
    "[ sec : exam ] we demonstrate utility of the expansion by applying it to some example systems in one and two spatial dimensions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] we discuss our results and make concluding remarks .",
    "some technicalities are deferred to an appendix .",
    "in this section , we address two quantum - mechanical phenomena  diffraction in time , pioneered by moshinsky @xcite , and diffraction in space , as described by kirchhoff theory @xcite .",
    "we recast standard descriptions of both phenomena in a way analogous to a time - dependent formulation of the huygens - fresnel principle .",
    "expressed in this way , the two diffraction processes appear to be closely related and can be straightforwardly unified into a single model of diffraction in space and time .      in order to facilitate the clarity of the following presentation , we begin by introducing central physical quantities and fixing notation .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the quantum propagator @xmath3 that describes the motion of a quantum particle in the @xmath4-dimensional coordinate space by relating a particle s wave function @xmath5 at time @xmath6 to that at time @xmath7 through @xmath8 the propagator is the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath9 with the initial condition @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the hamilton operator in the position representation .",

    "@xcite for reviews ) . in its one - dimensional formulation , the moshinsky problem",
    "is concerned with time evolution of a quantum particle , whose wave function @xmath21 is localized to the semi - infinite interval @xmath22 at time @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath23 for @xmath24 . over time , an absorbing wall ( shutter ) is switched `` on '' and `` off '' at the point @xmath25 , according to a protocol defined by a characteristic function @xmath26 .",
    "the latter is allowed to take values between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with @xmath27 representing the case of perfect absorption ( shutter `` on '' ) and @xmath28 corresponding to perfect transmission ( shutter `` off '' ) . the open interval @xmath29 represents the case of partially absorbing and partially transmitting ( but reflection - free ) shutter .",
    "one is then interested in the wave function @xmath21 of the particle to the right of the shutter , @xmath30 , at @xmath31 .",
    "moshinsky @xcite analyzed this problem for a `` monochromatic '' incident wave @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the heaviside step function , and a perfectly absorbing shutter that gets suddenly removed at an instant @xmath35 , i.e. , @xmath36 .",
    "his analysis showed that at times @xmath37 , the front of the probability density wave exhibits patterns identical to those observed in the fresnel diffraction of light from the edge of a semi - infinite plane , thus giving rise to the term `` diffraction in time '' .",
    "our objective is to devise an expression for the propagator @xmath38 that describes moshinsky diffraction by a shutter positioned at a point @xmath25 , such that @xmath39 and controlled ( opened and closed ) in accordance with the characteristic function @xmath26 of an arbitrary functional form .",
    "our construction relies on the huygens - fresnel principle , which , for the purpose of the current problem , can be formulated as follows : the disturbance at the point @xmath40 produced by a source @xmath41 , located at some other point @xmath42 , can be viewed as produced by a fictitious source @xmath43 , located at a point @xmath25 in between @xmath42 and @xmath40 , cf .",
    "( [ eq : x - points ] ) .",
    "the strength of the fictitious source @xmath43 is determined by the disturbance at the point @xmath25 produced by the original source @xmath41 .",
    "when a ( partially ) absorbing shutter is placed at the point @xmath25 , the strength of the fictitious source @xmath43 is modulated by the characteristic function @xmath26 taking values between 0 and 1 .",

    "interested in determining the functional form of @xmath51 , we first direct our attention to the simplest possible scenario , in which the shutter stays open throughout the entire time interval from 0 to @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath52 for @xmath53 . in this case , the propagator in the left - hand side of eq .",

    "in this paper we have revisited the phenomenon of diffraction in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "more specifically , we have considered the problem of a quantum particle passing through an opening ( or a set of openings ) in a perfectly absorbing screen .",

    "the expansion represents the full propagator as a sum of products of two free particle propagators , one connecting the initial point and the other connecting the final point to a point in the opening .",
    "the construction holds in the cases of curved ( convex or concave ) screens and for openings whose shape changes in time .",
    "consequently , our approach allows one to analyze the quantum phenomena of diffraction in space and diffraction in time , as well as the interplay between the two .    in order to illustrate the method ,",
    "we have used our propagator expansion to calculate diffraction patterns for an initially localized wave packet passing through various spatio - temporal diffraction screens in one and two dimensions .",
    "thus , in two dimensions , we have investigated the effect of screen curvature on the diffraction pattern by analyzing diffraction in time produced by absorbing parabolic shutters and demonstrating how a convex ( concave ) shutter gives rise to effective focusing ( defocusing ) of the wave function .",
    "we have also studied diffraction of spatially localized wave packets passing through holes of time - dependent size .",
    "we have shown that the shape of a diffracted wave function is largely determined by the space - time geometry of the hole , suggesting the use of time - dependent obstacles in @xmath4-dimensional systems for modeling quantum diffraction on stationary obstacles in @xmath245-dimensional systems .",
    "the approach , developed in this paper , is applicable to quantum diffraction on perfectly absorbing screens , and , therefore , complements the method of brukner and zeilinger @xcite valid for perfectly reflecting screens . in laboratory experiments , however , diffraction screens are typically neither perfectly absorbing nor perfectly reflecting , and the two methods have to be used in combination .",
