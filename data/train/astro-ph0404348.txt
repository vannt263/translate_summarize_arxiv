    "an important test of any cosmological model is that it be consistent with the observed distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "since our primary knowledge of this distribution comes from observations of galaxies , it is essential to understand the extent to which galaxies trace the matter density .",
    "this relationship is usually quantified by a bias factor which relates fluctuations in the galaxies to those in the dark matter .",
    "it is complicated by the fact that the relation between the luminosity of a galaxy or groups of galaxies and the underlying distribution of matter can depend on the type of galaxy , the spectral band of the observation , the redshift @xmath7 , and the scale length on which the comparison is made .",
    "however , such complications are also opportunities in that models of galaxy formation must successfully reproduce these differences .",
    "the standard definition of the bias factor , @xmath8 , is the ratio of the fractional galaxy density fluctuations to the fractional matter density fluctuations , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mean density of galaxies , @xmath11 is the mean density of matter and @xmath12 indicates the @xmath13 fluctuations of the densities about these means . if galaxies formed early ( @xmath14 ) , as appears to be the case ( e.g. , ellis 1997 ) , then there are good reasons to expect that , for linear density perturbations ( i.e. , @xmath15 ) on large scales in the nearby ( @xmath16 ) universe , galaxies should be relatively unbiased ( @xmath17 ) tracers of the density field ( fry 1996 , tegmark & peebles 1998 ) ; however , this assertion must be tested .",
    "here we focus on determining the bias of the hard x - ray background ( xrb ) , which is known to be dominated by distant ( @xmath18 ) active extragalactic galaxies and so provides a probe of the bias on large scales .",
    "the observed clustering of the xrb , when combined with what is known about the level of perturbations and the cosmological model from cmb observations , allows us to place relatively strong constraints on the x - ray bias .",
    "previous determinations of x - ray bias have resulted in a wide range of values , @xmath19 ( see barcons et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "some spread in the estimates is to be expected ; e.g. , at lower energies x - ray emission is dominated by clusters of galaxies , and so are expected to be as highly biased as clusters themselves ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ) . however , another major contribution to the uncertainty in the bias estimates is the lack of accurate determinations of the clustering of various x - ray sources .",
    "two of the lower estimates of x - ray bias are from treyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who found that @xmath20 to @xmath21 from a low order multipole analysis of the heao1 a2 data set and carrera et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who found that the ratio of the x - ray bias of agn to that of iras galaxies to be @xmath22 from rosat observations .",
    "the remaining uncertainty in these determinations arose from uncertainties in both the x - ray luminosity function ( lf ) and in the cosmological model .",
    "knowledge of both of these has improved dramatically in the last year and this is largely responsible for the improved accuracy of the estimate of @xmath3 in this paper .",
    "we recently presented evidence of large - scale clustering in the heao1 a2 @xmath23 full - sky map of the hard xrb on angular scales of @xmath24 ( boughn , crittenden , & koehrsen 2002 ) . before computing the correlations , local sources of the x - ray background",
    "were removed from the map .",
    "the map was masked so as to eliminate strong , nearby x - ray sources with fluxes exceeding @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , all regions within @xmath26 of the galactic plane or within @xmath27 of the galactic center were masked .",
    "the map was also corrected for a linear time drift of the detectors , high galactic latitude diffuse emission , emission from the local supercluster , and the compton - getting dipole .",
    "the latter components were fit to and then removed from the map . without these cuts and corrections ,",
    "the correlations are dominated by a few strong point sources and large - scale diffuse structures in the map .",
    "figure 1 is a plot of the intensity angular correlation function ( acf ) given by @xmath28 where the sum is over all pairs of map pixels , @xmath29 , separated by an angle @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the intensity of the @xmath32 pixel , @xmath33 is the mean intensity , and @xmath34 is the number of pairs of pixels separated by @xmath30 .",
    "photon shot noise only appears in the @xmath35 bin and has been removed .",
    "the highly correlated error bars were determined from 1000 monte carlo trials in which the pixel intensity distribution was assumed to be gaussian with the same acf as in the figure .",
    "the dashed curve represents the expected functional form of the contribution to the acf due to telescope beam smearing of a random distribution of uncorrelated sources normalized to the acf(0 ) point .",
    "it represents the profile that is expected if there were no intrinsic correlations in the xrb .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) of the map is due to pixelization and to the finite telescope beam and was accurately determined from the profiles of 60 bright , nearby point sources .",
    "it is clear from figure 1 that the xrb possesses intrinsic ( i.e. , not due to beam smearing ) correlated structure out to angular scales of @xmath36 .",
    "full details of the analysis are discussed in boughn , crittenden , & koehrsen ( 2002 ) .",
    "in order to determine the x - ray bias factor @xmath3 from the measured acf , it is essential to know from which redshifts the x - ray fluctuations originate ; the underlying density fluctuations grow quickly , so it is important that they be compared to the x - ray fluctuations at the same redshifts .",
    "this requires understanding the contribution to the @xmath23 x - ray lf as a function of redshift .",
    "however , the heao1 a2 observations are total intensity measurements of the hard xrb with no information as to the fluxes or redshifts of individual sources , so we must infer the lf by other means .",
    "recently the @xmath37 satellite has made possible large , faint hard x - ray surveys with measured redshifts .",
    "cowie et al . ( 2003 ) and steffen et al . (",
    "2003 ) have combined @xmath37 sources with brighter sources from @xmath38 ( akiyama et al .",
    "2000 ) and @xmath39 ( lehmann et al . 2001 ) to determine the redshift evolution of the @xmath0 lf with few assumptions about the character of the sources . the incompleteness uncertainty in the redshift dependence of the volume x - ray emissivity is estimated to be a factor @xmath40 at any redshift .",
    "the spectroscopically identified sources comprise @xmath41 of the total @xmath0 x - ray intensity ; the dominant uncertainties result from the unknown redshift distribution of the unidentified sources .",
    "emissivity as a function of redshift , @xmath42 , is plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the @xmath0 emissivity in the redshift range @xmath43 is taken to be that estimated by cowie et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using rosat data . in the range @xmath44",
    ", we use the emissivity implied from the luminosity function of steffen et al .",
    "finally , for @xmath45 , we use the value of the local emissivity from miyaji et al .",
    "the models discussed below are based on a polynomial fit which passes through the data points ; however , the results are largely independent of the details of the fitted function .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : dipole ]",
    "the heao data is band limited and the x - rays detected at high redshifts have larger rest frame energies than they do locally .",
    "therefore , in order to apply k - corrections to the observed intensities and to transform from @xmath0 emissivities to the @xmath23 values appropriate for the heao map , we must make an assumption about the frequency and redshift dependence of the xrb .",
    "if the ism column density in front of an agn is large enough ( @xmath46 ) the observed spectrum will be hardened by photo - electric absortion . at high redshifts ,",
    "the rest frame energies of the detected x - rays are relatively large and the effect of photo - electric absorption is less .",
    "therefore , for a given column density , sources at high redshift will appear softer than their low redshift counterparts . as a crude approximation of this affect we assumed a photon spectral index @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the number spectrum of the photons of energy @xmath49 .",
    "this roughly describes the redshift dependence of sources with an intrinsic spectral index of @xmath50 subject to photoelectric absorption by column densities of @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , the flux weighted average spectral index is @xmath52 as is observed .",
    "the difference between this model and one that assumes a constant spectral index of @xmath53 is not large in the sense that the intensity distributions , @xmath54 , of the two models fall well within the range of the extreme models of figure 3 .",
    "it is also possible that higher redshift agn are more heavily absorbed ( e.g. worsley et al . 2004 ) ; however , such effects are not included in some models of the xrb ( e.g. , ueda et al . 2003 ) .",
    "if the absorption levels were higher at higher redshifts , this would reduce the evolution of the spectral index , i.e. , lessen it s dependence on redshift . the fact that we observe more energetic rest frame photons is balanced by the fact that the sources are more absorbed . while neither of the models ( constant @xmath53 or @xmath47 ) is likely to accurately describe the actual spectrum",
    ", the fact that the biases of these models are within a few percent of each other indicates that uncertainty in the redshift dependence of the spectral index of the xrb is not an important source of systematic error .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the intensity distribution , @xmath54 , from @xmath42 in the context of the @xmath2 cosmological model used by cowie et al ( 2003 ) ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ) . while this model is somewhat different from that currently favored by the @xmath58 satellite data ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , @xmath54 is a directly observable quantity that is independent of the cosmological model . the @xmath54 resulting from our canonical emissivity model is given by the middle solid curve in figure 3 where the normalization is fixed by the lf of cowie et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and steffen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "this profile implies that the bulk of the xrb arises at much lower redshifts than previously thought ( e.g. , comastri et al .",
    "1996 ) as was first pointed out by barger et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . for this particular model ,",
    "@xmath59 of the @xmath23 background arises from redshifts less than 1 .",
    "this is in agreement with the recent observations of barger et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that indicate @xmath60 of the spectroscopically identified @xmath0 intensity arises at @xmath61 .",
    "this increases to @xmath62 when photometric redshifts are included ( barger et al .",
    "2002 ; barger et al .",
    "the total integrated intensity of our canonical model , @xmath63 , lies between and is consistent with both the @xmath64 estimate of @xmath65 ( marshall et al . 1980 ; gruber et al . 1999 ) and that estimated from @xmath38 satellite data ( gendreau et al . 1995 ; kushino et al .",
    "2002 ) , @xmath66 . in any case",
    ", the current analysis only requires the functional form of @xmath54 and not the overall normalization . finally , the intensity weighted spectral index of the model , @xmath67 , is the same as that observed for the hard xrb ( marshall et al .",
    "1980 ; gendreau et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in order to test the sensitivity of the implied x - ray bias to the lf",
    ", we consider three alternative models of @xmath54 .",
    "the upper dashed curve in figure 3 has been weighted to low @xmath7 by squeezing ( in redshift ) the canonical emissivity by a factor of @xmath68 while fixing the local emissivity to be the @xmath69 upper limit of miyaji et al .",
    "this model is fairly extreme , as it overestimates the intensity coming from low redshifts .",
    "( see table 1 for a summary of the properties of the various x - ray models ) .",
    "the lower dashed curve in figure 3 was weighted to high @xmath7 by stretching the canonical emissivity by a factor of @xmath70 while fixing the local emissivity to be the @xmath71 lower limit of miyaji et al .",
    "this model significantly underestimates the intensity coming from @xmath72 .",
    "finally , the dotted curve in figure 3 is from the recent agn synthesis model of ueda et al .",
    "unfortunately , their model of @xmath54 did not extend below @xmath73 and our results below depend somewhat on the behaviour assumed for low redshifts .",
    "given the x - ray luminosity function , the linear bias factor can be inferred from the cosmological model , but only if the time dependence and scale dependence of the bias are known . in our analysis",
    "we will assume both redshift and scale independence of the x - ray bias .",
    "given our nominal intensity distribution , and assuming the standard @xmath2 cosmology , the dominant contribution to the acf on angular scales of a few degrees comes from structures with redshifts , @xmath74 , which correspond to linear scales of from approximately @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "this is a strong indication that we are observing clustering in the linear regime and so can use the straightforward analysis of the growth of linear structures in a @xmath2 universe .    using the current @xmath58 @xmath2 parameters ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , i.e. , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , it is straightforward to compute a projected matter acf with the same redshift distribution as for the canonical model ( e.g. , boughn , crittenden , & turok 1998 ) . if our assumptions about the bias are correct , the intrinsic x - ray acf should have the same shape as the normalized matter acf , with a relative amplitude given by the square of @xmath3 , the x - ray bias factor .",
    "the observed acf also contains components due to beam smearing of uncorrelated x - ray sources and photon shot noise , the latter of which is uncorrelated and , therefore , only contributes to the acf at @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , any fit to the full data set must include these three components . at @xmath81",
    "the acf is dominated by beam smearing and photon shot noise while above @xmath82 the signal to noise is small .",
    "the solid curve in figure 1 is the two parameter , maximum likelihood fit to the data in the range @xmath83 .",
    "the implied x - ray bias is @xmath84 ( @xmath69 error ) or @xmath5 with a @xmath85 of 4.6 for 6 degrees of freedom .",
    "since the distribution of errors in the acf is to a good approximation gaussian , the statistical error attached to @xmath86 as well as the @xmath85 of the fit have the usual interpretations .",
    "the error indicated for @xmath3 represents the @xmath87 confidence interval ; however , this error is not gaussian .",
    "the signal to noise of the data point at @xmath88 is @xmath89 and a variety of fits ( see below ) of @xmath86 to the acf indicate statistical significances between @xmath90 and @xmath89 .",
    "we performed a variety of other fits to the data to check the robustness of our estimate of @xmath86 .",
    "a three parameter fit to the data in the full interval ( @xmath91 ) gives @xmath92 .",
    "a one parameter fit for the large angle correlations ( @xmath93 ) , where the beam smearing component is nearly negligible , gives @xmath94 ; even a fit to the single datum at @xmath88 yields a consistent value of @xmath95 , though it is probably mildly contaminated by the beam smearing component .",
    "following our previous work ( boughn , crittenden , & koehrsen 2002 ) , we also modeled the clustering term as a power law , @xmath96 , with @xmath97 .",
    "these fits varied in amplitude ; however , at @xmath98 all of the fits agreed to within a few percent .",
    "normalizing the model clustering acf to this level implies a bias of @xmath99 , also consistent with our canonical fit .",
    "the reduced @xmath100 s for these fits are all @xmath101 and the fits are all consistent with each other .",
    "the process of fitting for large - scale , diffuse components and then removing them from the @xmath64 map , results in some attenuation of the acf on angular scales @xmath102 .",
    "these factors were determined from the same monte carlo trials that were used to determine the statistical errors and the fits were adjusted accordingly . even if these factors are ignored , the fit value of @xmath3 changes by only @xmath103 .    to evaluate the level of uncertainty due a systematic error in the intensity distribution of the xrb ,",
    "the two `` extreme '' models of figure 3 were also fit to the data in the @xmath83 interval .",
    "the biases resulting from these two fits are @xmath104 for the low z model and @xmath105 for the high z model .",
    "since these models are somewhat exaggerated , we conclude that they represent lower and upper limits of systematic errors due to uncertainty in @xmath54 .",
    "a fit to the ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) model indicated in figure 3 results in a similar value of the bias , though the precise results depend on how the model is extended to low redshifts ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "if this model is extended so that the low z behavior is not allowed to fall below that implied by miyaji et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , @xmath107 , then the fit value of @xmath3 becomes @xmath108 , which is consistent with that implied by our canonical model .",
    "if instead , we use a linear extrapolation to low redshifts , the bias can be somewhat ( @xmath109 ) higher , but the local emissivity of this model would be nearly @xmath110 below that implied by miyaji et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "the acf on large angular scales is quite sensitive to the contribution of low @xmath7 sources ( roughly half the acf at @xmath98 is due to sources with @xmath111 ) , so any error in estimating the low redshift cutoff in @xmath54 could affect the results dramatically . by masking sources stronger than @xmath25",
    "we effectively truncate the intensity distribution at low redshifts .",
    "the truncated profiles were determined from the flux cut and the local luminosity function of steffen et al .",
    "if the value of the flux cut is in error due to , for example , a difference in normalizations of the source catalog used to make the cuts ( piccinotti et al .",
    "1982 ) and the steffen et al .",
    "luminosity function , then this would affect the cutoff redshift and would be translated to an error in the predicted acf . in the extreme limit of no flux cut , i.e. , no truncation of the @xmath54 profile , the implied x - ray bias is @xmath112 . in the other extreme ,",
    "i.e. , a flux cutoff of @xmath113 , the implied bias is @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that inaccuracy in characterizing the flux cut is the source of significant systematic error .",
    "potentially more problematic is the redshift distribution of the unresolved component of the xrb .",
    "worsley et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that above @xmath115 only @xmath116 of the xrb is resolved ; although , this conclusion must be tempered somewhat by the fact that the brightest sources they considered ( in the lockman hole ) have fluxes of @xmath117 .",
    "sources brighter than this contribute to the whole - sky xrb and they conclude that the true resolved fraction may be 10 to 20% higher . even though only @xmath118 of the counts in the heao passband comes from photons with energies above @xmath115 ,",
    "an unresolved component can still significantly affect the estimate of the bias . as a pessimistic case , we ignore the bright source correction and assume a @xmath119 unresolved component below @xmath120 . in this case",
    "roughly @xmath121 of the 2 - 10",
    "@xmath122 xrb is unresolved .",
    "if this unresolved component is distributed in redshift like the resolved component , then there is no change in the implied bias . on the other hand ,",
    "if the unresolved component is entirely due to sources at high redshift where it does not contribute to the acf signal , then the implied bias will be @xmath123 higher than our canonical value .",
    "if instead the unresolved component is due to sources at low redshift , @xmath61 , then the implied bias will be @xmath124 lower than our canonical value .",
    "these fall somewhat outside our two `` extreme '' values in table 1 and so provide a caveat to those estimates of the limits of systematic error .",
    "however , if only half of the unresolved component is located at high ( low ) redshifts and the other half is distributed like the resolved component , then the implied bias is only @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) higher ( lower ) than our canonical value , well within the limits of table 1 .",
    "it is difficult to quantify all possible systematic errors ; however , considering that the above `` extremes '' result in errors of the same order as the statistical error in the fit , we conclude that the total systematic error is no larger than the statistical error quoted .",
    "we have determined the x - ray bias of the hard xrb assuming it is time ( i.e. , redshift ) and scale independent .",
    "these assumptions are probably quite reasonable since the mean redshift weighting of the x - ray acf is quite low , @xmath126 , and the linear scales probed by the acf are quite large ( @xmath75 to @xmath76 ) .",
    "even if these assumptions are violated to some extent , @xmath3 can still be interpreted as an ` average ' x - ray bias .",
    "there are several types of sources that contribute to the xrb , including quasars , seyfert galaxies , liners , and clusters of galaxies , and the implied value of the bias must be considered to be an average over all these sources . however , the dominant contribution to the xrb is most likely to be moderately active agn ( cowie et al .",
    "2003 ) , so @xmath3 should be representative of the bulk of the sources of the xrb .    with these caveats in mind , we find an x - ray bias of @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 ( statistical error only ) .",
    "this error includes photon shot noise , fluctuations in the xrb from beam smearing , and the clustering of the xrb itself .",
    "the fits of @xmath3 for two extreme models of @xmath54 indicate that the uncertainty due to our ignorance of the x - ray luminosity function is likely less than the statistical error .",
    "other possible sources of systematic error also seem small .",
    "we conclude that the hard xrb is a largely unbiased tracer of the matter distribution on large scales .",
    "this is consistent with current models of large - scale , late time galaxy biasing ( benson et al .",
    "2000 ; tegmark & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , the latest studies of the clustering of @xmath127 galaxies on @xmath128 scales indicates that these objects are also unbiased tracers of matter .",
    "verde et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that , on scales of @xmath129 to @xmath130 , @xmath131 for @xmath132 galaxies in the @xmath133 survey with a mean redshift of @xmath134 . using a different analysis of the same data , lahav et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that @xmath135 on scales of @xmath136 to @xmath137 . both of these results are consistent with early findings from the sdss and 2mass surveys that imply linear bias factors on the order of unity ( tegmark et al .",
    "2002 ; miller et al .",
    "it should not be surprising that the xrb and galaxy biases are similar since @xmath6 galaxies are closely associated with the moderately active agn that comprise the bulk of the hard xrb ( e.g. , barger et al .",
    "2003 ; miller et al .",
    "2003 ) .    if these estimates are accurate , then the x - ray bias factor in the linear regime is now much better determined .",
    "the hard xrb background appears to be an excellent tracer of the large - scale distribution of matter , making it a useful tool for understanding the evolution of structure in the universe .",
    "one example of the importance of determining galaxy biases ( and indeed the driving motivation for this work ) is to aid in the interpretation of recent detections of correlations of galaxies with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . we ( boughn & crittenden 2004 ) have detected a correlation of the @xmath23 xrb with @xmath58 satellite map of the cosmic microwave background ( bennett et al .",

    "<S> recent deep x - ray surveys combined with spectroscopic identification of the sources have allowed the determination of the rest - frame @xmath0 luminosity as a function of redshift . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , an analysis of the @xmath1 full - sky map of the x - ray background ( xrb ) reveals clustering on the scale of several degrees . </S>",
    "<S> combining these two results in the context of the currently favored @xmath2 cosmological model implies an average x - ray bias factor , @xmath3 , of @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these error estimates include only statistical error ; the systematic error sources , while comparable , appear to be sub - dominant . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in contrast to the large biases of some previous estimates and is more in line with current estimates of the optical bias of @xmath6 galaxies . </S>"
