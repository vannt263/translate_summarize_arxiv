    "<S> we introduce a generic frhlich - coulomb model of the oxides , which also includes infinite on - site ( hubbard ) repulsion , and describe a simple analytical method of solving the multi - polaron problem in complex lattice structures . </S>",
    "<S> two particular lattices , a zig - zag ladder and a perovskite layer , are studied . </S>",
    "<S> we find that depending on the relative strength of the frhlich and coulomb interactions these systems are either polaronic fermi ( or luttinger)-liquids , bipolaronic superconductors , or charge segregated insulators . in the superconducting phase </S>",
    "<S> the carriers are superlight mobile bipolarons . </S>",
    "<S> the model describes key features of the cuprates such as their t@xmath0 values , the isotope effects , the normal state diamagnetism , pseudogap , and spectral functions measured in tunnelling and photoemission . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that a low fermi energy and strong coupling of carriers with high - frequency phonons is the cause of high critical temperatures in novel superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> there is overwhelming experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence for an exceptionally strong electron - phonon ( el - ph ) interaction in the cuprates , which competes with electron correlations . in recent years </S>",
    "<S> , several publications addressed the fundamental problem of competing el - ph and coulomb interactions in the framework of the so - called holstein - hubbard model @xcite , where both interactions are short - range ( on - site ) . </S>",
    "<S> the model describes well many properties of the insulating state of the cuprates , including antiferromagnetism , lattice distortions , and phase segregation . </S>",
    "<S> however , it could hardly account for the high value of the superconducting critical temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of ( bi)polaronic carriers in this model is very large in the relevant parameter region , and @xmath1 is suppressed below the kelvin scale .    in choosing the correct interaction for htsc , </S>",
    "<S> we take into account that most of the novel superconductors are doped insulators with highly polarizable ionic lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the low density of mobile carriers is unable to screen effectively the direct coulomb electron - ion and electron - electron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the layered structure of the cuprates reduces screening even further . since the mobile carriers are confined to the copper - oxygen planes their interaction with out - of - plane ions , such as the apical oxygens , is particularly strong . </S>",
    "<S> a parameter - free estimate of the polaron binding energy @xmath2 in the cuprates puts it at about 0.5 ev or larger @xcite . this strong long - range ( frhlich ) </S>",
    "<S> el - ph interaction necessarily leads to formation of small polarons . </S>",
    "<S> such frhlich small polarons were first considered in reference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> exact monte - carlo simulations of the single polaron problem @xcite showed that a long - range el - ph interaction effectively removes the difficulty with a large polaron ( and bipolaron ) mass in the holstein - type el - ph models . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the polaron is heavy because it has to carry a lattice deformation with it which is the same deformation that forms the polaron itself . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , there exists a generic relation between @xmath2 and the renormalization of its mass : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a characteristic phonon frequency and @xmath5 is a numeric coefficient whose actual value depends on the radius of the interaction . for a short - range el - ph interaction ( holstein ) </S>",
    "<S> the _ entire _ lattice deformation disappears and then forms in the new place when the polaron moves between the nearest lattices sites </S>",
    "<S> . therefore , @xmath6 and the polaron is very heavy for the characteristic cuprates values @xmath7 ev and @xmath8 ev . in the case of a long - range interaction , only a fraction of the total deformation changes every time the polaron moves and @xmath9 could be as small as 0.25 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , this results in a dramatic mas reduction since @xmath9 enters the exponent . </S>",
    "<S> thus the effective mass could be @xmath10 where a naive holstein - like estimate would yield a huge mass @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the above qualitative reasoning was fully confirmed by analytical @xcite and numerical ( approximation - free monte carlo ) @xcite studies of the double - chain and double - plane models with long - range el - ph interactions . </S>",
    "<S> later the single - polaron and bipolaron cases of the chain model were analyzed in more detail in references @xcite and @xcite , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these studies confirmed a much lower mass of both polaron and bipolaron in comparison to the holstein - hubbard limit .    </S>",
    "<S> here we argue that a consistent theory of htsc must include both the long - range coulomb repulsion between the carriers and the strong long - range electron - phonon interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an analytically solvable multi - polaron model of high - temperature superconductivity that includes these realistic long - range interactions . from theoretical standpoint , </S>",
    "<S> the long - range coulomb repulsion is critical in ensuring that the carriers would not form large clusters . indeed , in order to form stable _ pairs _ </S>",
    "<S> ( bipolarons ) the el - ph interaction has to be strong enough to overcome the coulomb repulsion at short distances . since the el - ph interaction is long - range , there is a potential possibility for clustering . </S>",
    "<S> we shall demonstrate that the inclusion of the coulomb repulsion @xmath12 makes the clusters unstable . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , there is a certain window of @xmath13 inside which the clusters are unstable but bipolarons nonetheless form . in this parameter window </S>",
    "<S> the bipolarons are light and the system is a superconductor with a high critical temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the bipolarons repel each other and propagate in a band of about the same bandwidth as the single - polaron bandwidth , in sharp contrast with all bipolaronic models considered previously . at a weaker coulomb interaction </S>",
    "<S> the system is a charge segregated insulator . at a stronger coulomb repulsion </S>",
    "<S> the system is a polaron fermi ( or luttinger ) liquid . in the superconducting phase but close to the clustering boundary </S>",
    "<S> , dynamical formation of short lived clusters or stripes could be expected .    </S>",
    "<S> our generic frhlich - coulomb model explicitly includes the electron kinetic energy , the infinite - range coulomb and electron - phonon interactions as well as the lattice energy . </S>",
    "<S> the implicitly present infinite hubbard @xmath14 prohibits double occupancy and removes the need to distinguish the fermionic spin . </S>",
    "<S> introducing spinless fermion operators @xmath15 and phonon operators @xmath16 , the model hamiltonian is written as @xmath17 we note that the el - ph term is written in real rather than momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> this is more convenient in working with complex lattices . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 is the polarization vector of @xmath19th vibration coordinate at site @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the unit vector in the direction from electron @xmath22 to the ion @xmath20 , and @xmath23 is the dimensionless el - ph coupling function . </S>",
    "<S> [ @xmath23 is proportional to the _ force _ acting between @xmath20 and @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> ] we assume that all the phonon modes are dispersionless with frequency @xmath4 and that the electrons do not interact with displacements of their own atoms , @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we also use @xmath25 throughout the paper .    in general , the many - body model ( 1 ) is of considerable complexity . </S>",
    "<S> however , we are interested in the limit of strong el - ph interaction . in this case , the kinetic energy is a perturbation and the model can be grossly simplified in a two - step procedure . on the first step , </S>",
    "<S> the lang - firsov canonical transformation @xcite is performed which diagonalizes the last three terms in equation ( 1 ) . introducing @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the transformed hamiltonian without an explicit el - ph term @xmath27 the last term describes the energy which polarons gain due to el - ph interaction . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is the familiar polaron ( franc - condon ) shift @xmath28 which we assume to be independent of @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 is a natural measure of the strength of the el - ph interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the third term in eq.(2 ) is the polaron - polaron interaction : @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the inter - polaron _ attraction _ due to joint interaction with the same vibrating atoms . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the first term in equation ( 2 ) contains the transformed hopping operator @xmath32 : @xmath33 ( d_{{\\bf m}\\alpha } ^{\\dagger } - d_{{\\bf m}\\alpha } ) \\right ] .    </S>",

    "<S> should be averaged over phonons because there is no coupling between polarons and phonons in the unperturbed hamiltonian [ the last three terms in equation ( 2 ) ] . for temperatures </S>",

    "<S> \\label{seven}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by comparing equations ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) with equation ( 8) , the mass renormalization exponents can be expressed via @xmath2 and @xmath38 as follows @xmath39 this results in a renormalized hopping term that represents the small parameter of a strong coupling perturbation theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above technical transformation is simple and has been described elsewhere @xcite together with a detailed description of the perturbation procedure . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting model is purely polaronic in which phonons are `` integrated out '' </S>",
    "<S> @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 when @xmath31 exceeds @xmath12 the full interaction becomes negative and polarons form pairs . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that while the above formalism fails in some regimes of the short - range el - ph models ( for instance , the adiabatic limit of the holstein model ) , it is surprisingly accurate for long - range el - ph interactions , as was demonstrated by comparing the analytical results with exact quantum monte carlo data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it makes theoretical analysis of even complex interactions and lattice geometries simple and instructive . </S>",
    "<S> but before proceeding to analyzing concrete lattices , let us elaborate on the physics behind the lattice sums in equations ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> when a carrier ( electron or hole ) acts on an ion with a force @xmath43 , it displaces the ion by some vector @xmath44 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 is the ion s force constant . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of the carrier - ion pair is @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely the summand in equation ( 3 ) expressed via dimensionless coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> now consider two carriers interacting with the _ same _ ion , see figure 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ion displacement is @xmath47 and the energy is @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the last term here should be interpreted as an ion - mediated interaction between the two carriers . </S>",
    "<S> it depends on the scalar product of @xmath49 and @xmath50 and consequently on the relative positions of the carriers with respect to the ion . </S>",
    "<S> if the ion is an isotropic harmonic oscillator , as we assume in this paper , then the following simple rule applies . </S>",
    "<S> if the angle @xmath51 between @xmath49 and @xmath50 is less than @xmath52 then the polaron - polaron interaction is attractive , otherwise it is repulsive , see figure 1(b ) . the overall sign and magnitude of the interaction </S>",
    "<S> is given by the lattice sum in equation ( 5 ) , evaluation of which is elementary . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that according to equation ( 9 ) , an attractive interaction reduces the polaron mass ( and consequently bipolaron mass ) , while repulsive interaction enhances the mass . </S>",
    "<S> thus in our model the long - range character of the el - ph interaction serves the double purpose . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , it generates additional inter - polaron attraction because the distant ions have small angle @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> this additional attraction helps overcome the direct coulomb repulsion between the polarons . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the frhlich interaction makes the bipolarons light leading to a high critical temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> the many - particle ground state of @xmath53 depends on the sign of the polaron - polaron interaction , the carrier density , and the lattice geometry . </S>",
    "<S> first we consider the zig - zag ladder , figure 2(a ) , assuming that all sites are isotropic two - dimensional harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity , we also adopt the nearest - neighbour approximation for both interactions , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and for the hopping integrals , @xmath56 for @xmath57 , and zero otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> hereafter we set the lattice period @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> there are four nearest neigbours in the ladder , @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the one - particle polaronic hamiltonian takes the form @xmath60 + t^{\\prime}[c^{\\dagger}_{n+1}c_{n}+p^{\\dagger}_{n+1}p_{n } + { \\rm h.c . } ] + t[p^{\\dagger}_{n } c_{n}+p^{\\dagger}_{n-1}c_{n } + { \\rm h.c . } ] \\right ) , \\label{eleven}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are polaronic operators on the lower and upper side of the ladder , respectively , see figure 2(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> applying the general formulas ( 3 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 9 ) , we obtain @xmath63 , @xmath64 $ ] , and @xmath65 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> fourier transformation yields the one - particle spectrum @xmath66 two overlapping polaronic bands have a combined width of @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the lower band has the bandwidth @xmath68 and the effective mass @xmath69 near the bottom , while the upper band has the bandwidth @xmath70 and a heavier mass @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now place two polarons on the ladder . </S>",
    "<S> the nearest neighbour interaction , equation ( 4 ) , is found as @xmath72 if two polarons are on the different sides of the ladder , and @xmath73 if both polarons are on the same side . </S>",
    "<S> the attractive interaction is provided via the displacement of the lattice sites which are the common nearest neighbours to both polarons , under the condition that the angle @xmath51 between the directions pointing from those sites to two polarons is less than @xmath74 . if @xmath75 the effective interaction of two polarons is repulsive . </S>",
    "<S> there are two such nearest neighbours for the intersite bipolaron of the type @xmath76 or @xmath77 , figure 2(c ) , but there is only one common nearest neighbour for the bipolaron @xmath78 , figure 2(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath79 , there are no bound states and the multi - polaron system is a 1d luttinger liquid . however , when @xmath80 and consequently @xmath81 , the two polarons are bound into an intersite bipolaron of the type @xmath76 or @xmath77 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is quite remarkable that the bipolaron tunnelling appears already in the first order in polaron hopping @xmath82 as was anticipated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this case is different from both the on - site bipolaron discussed a long time ago @xcite , and from the inter - site chain bipolaron discussed recently @xcite , where the bipolaron tunnelling was of the second order in @xmath83 . indeed , </S>",

    "<S> the bipolaron binding energy is @xmath89 the bipolaron mass near the bottom of the lowest band is @xmath90 . neglecting @xmath83 and @xmath91 relative to @xmath92 and @xmath93 we arrive at the following conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath94 , two polarons form a bipolaron with effective mass @xmath95 . the numerical coefficient </S>",
    "<S> @xmath96 ensures that @xmath97 remains of the order of @xmath98 even at large @xmath92 .    in models with strong intersite attraction </S>",

    "<S> , the lowest energy of @xmath99 polarons placed on the nearest neighbours of the ladder is found as @xmath100 , for any @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> there are _ no _ resonating states for @xmath99-polaron nearest neighbour configuration if @xmath101 . therefore there is no first - order kinetic energy contribution to their energy . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath102 should be compared with the energy @xmath103 of far separated @xmath104 bipolarons and a single polaron for odd @xmath101 , or with the energy of far separated @xmath99 bipolarons for even @xmath105 . </S>",

    "<S> many other features of the bipolaronic ( super)conductor , e.g. , the unusual upper critical field , electronic specific heat , optical , arpes and tunnelling spectra match those in the cuprates ( for a recent review , see reference @xcite ) .    finally , we show that the fermi energy in all novel superconductors is surprisingly low , of the order or even smaller than the most essential optical phonon energy . </S>",
    "<S> the band structure of the cuprates is quasi - two - dimensional with a few degenerate hole pockets . applying the parabolic approximation for the band dispersion one obtains the renormalized ( polaronic ) fermi energy as @xmath191 where @xmath162 is the interplane distance , and @xmath192 are the density of holes and their effective mass in each of the hole subbands @xmath193 renormalized by the electron - phonon ( and electron - electron ) interactions . </S>",

    "<S> the mean free path was found surprisingly large at low temperatures , @xmath203 100 - 1000  . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the cuprates are in the clean limit , @xmath204 , so that the parameter - free expression for @xmath199 , equation ( [ twentythree ] ) , is perfectly applicable .    equation ( 26 ) yields e@xmath205 mev for the cuprates , especially if the degeneracy @xmath198 is taken into account . </S>",

    "<S> we have introduced a realistic multi - polaron model of high - temperature superconductivity with the strong frhlich and coulomb long - range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we have described a simple procedure of calculating polaron and bipolaron masses , identified and quantitatively analyzed a new resonance mechanism of bipolaron mass reduction , and found the conditions for clustering of holes and the window for their high - t@xmath229 superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the model possesses a rich phase diagram in the coordinates of the inter - site coulomb repulsion @xmath12 and the polaronic ( franck - condon ) level shift @xmath2 , see figure 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state is a polaronic fermi ( or luttinger ) liquid , for the strong coulomb repulsion , bipolaronic high - temperature superconductor for the intermediate coulomb repulsion , and the charge - segregated insulator for the weak repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the inter - site bipolarons in the superconducting phase are `` superlight '' , propagating coherently with about the same mass as single polarons . in our model the bipolarons tunnel already in the first order in polaron tunnelling which results in the bipolaron mass scaling linearly with the polaron hopping integral . </S>",
    "<S> many properties of the model in the superconducting phase match those of the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that a surprisingly low fermi energy and the strong unscreened coupling of carriers with high frequency optical phonons is the origin of high temperature superconductivity .    </S>",
