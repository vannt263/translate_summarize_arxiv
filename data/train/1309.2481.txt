    "aqueous foams are present in many manufactured goods , from personal hygiene products to processed foods , but also play an important role in many industrial processes @xcite . some of these processes involve the injection of a foam into the earth s surface or subsurface , in particular to enhance oil recovery @xcite or as a carrier fluid for soil remediation processes @xcite .",
    "this latter application is recent and particularly promising as there are many expected advantages of injecting a foam rather than a single phase fluid in the polluted soil .",
    "it allows a large reduction of the needed volume of liquid for a given injection volume , while maintaining a very good compatibility with the surfactants already used for soil remediation @xcite .",
    "there is also the potential capacity for the selective transport of material by the foam , in the form of particles of polluted soil or colloidal pollutant , in the same manner as in ore separation by froth flotation .",
    "in addition , if bioremediation of a soil is required , the transport of air along with the liquid in a foam may enhance the efficiency of any biological activity @xcite .",
    "in both enhanced oil recovery and soil remediation a foam flows through a porous material with a complex geometry .",
    "being able to predict how a foam flows in a confined , tortuous , geometry is therefore of great importance , and has been studied for many years @xcite .",
    "laboratory - scale experiments most commonly study the flow through a cylindrical column of a porous material , consisting of either a model system , such as packed glass beads , or a sample of soil , sand or rock from the field .",
    "bertin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained a puzzling experimental result during testing of a heterogeneous porous medium : the ( interstitial ) velocity of the foam front invading a saturated porous medium was larger in the low permeability region than in the high permeability region .",
    "the mobility of the foam is classically quantified through an _ effective viscosity _ , defined as the viscosity of the newtonian fluid that would flow at the same velocity in the same geometry under an identical pressure head @xcite . for a bubble size larger than the characteristic pore size , even in heterogeneous porous media , the foam is organized in trains of lamellae @xcite . in this case ,",
    "kovscek and bertin @xcite have shown theoretically that the specific dissipation associated with this structure leads to an effective viscosity of the foam that scales with the permeability @xmath0 of the porous medium as a power law with an exponent @xmath1 .",
    "this key ingredient , also observed in @xcite , is at the origin of the faster invasion of the low permeability regions of heterogeneous porous media when foam is used instead of a newtonian fluid .",
    "however , the complex models developed to address this type of behaviour @xcite involve many different assumptions about local processes ( local dissipation laws , local foam structure , bubble production and coalescence rate ) .",
    "full visualisations of foam flows in model porous media are therefore urgently needed to validate and improve these theoretical approaches .",
    "two - dimensional diphasic flows in porous media have been investigated extensively in the last 25 years , allowing researchers to map out the rich phenomenology of flow regimes @xcite , to finely characterize their dynamics @xcite , and gain partial understanding of how the pore scale dynamics results in macroscopic transport properties @xcite .",
    "these experimental studies have relied on disordered porous media consisting of networks of linear channels , monolayers of glass beads , or , more recently , microfluidic devices @xcite .",
    "however , the limit in which the liquid fraction of the foam is very low has seen little investigation , although bubble formation in this limit has been investigated in @xcite , for air in pure water or in a solution of surfactants .",
    "this dry foam limit involves specific foam stability issues , making the problem more complicated .",
    "here we investigate the basic flow behaviour of a dry two - dimensional foam as it moves through two parallel linear channels enclosed in a larger cell ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : channelheleshaw ] ) .",
    "this simple system mimics the bifurcation of a large pore into two smaller ones ( at the entrance to the two channels ) , and the reconnection of two small pores into a larger one ( at the exit ) .",
    "the width of each channel is uniform along its length , and the two widths can be varied systematically for given bubble size and combined channel width . with this very simple geometry",
    "we can investigate how the total foam flux , which is imposed upstream , is distributed into the two channels .",
    "we believe this represents an important local step toward the understanding of the flux distributions in heterogeneous porous media .",
    "the pressure drop along such a channel has been measured for a single channel in a similar geometry @xcite and explored theoretically with the viscous froth model @xcite . in this study",
    "we use these established results to determine the pressure drop from the velocity and structure of the foam , and show that the dissipation law used in @xcite is valid for simple trains of lamellae . however , when the foam structure is more complex , with several bubbles across the channel section , we show how to modify the model to correctly reproduce our experimental results .",
    "this correction comes from the dependence of the friction force on the film orientation @xcite .",
    "we also show that , even for channels much longer than the bubble size , end effects are important , and they are much greater for channels venting to open air .",
    "we rationalise these end effects by taking into account the competition between viscous and capillary forces .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "our methods are given in [ methods ] and the experimental results for enclosed and open - ended channels are described in [ results ] . in [ model ] we discuss the theoretical model that we compare to experiments in [ comp ] . finally , we draw conclusions in [ conclusion ] .",
    "the double - channel flow experiments were carried out in a hele - shaw cell with a plate separation of either @xmath2  cm or @xmath3  cm .",
    "rectangular obstacles cut from polycarbonate sheet were placed within the hele - shaw cell to form two parallel channels .",
    "the channel length @xmath4 is 15 cm for all experiments , and the values of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , defined on fig .",
    "[ fig : channelheleshaw](a ) , could be changed to meet individual test requirements .",
    "the central obstacle could be moved sideways to study asymmetric channel configurations . for the experiment shown in this paper , we chose @xmath11 and @xmath12 , unless different values are specified .",
    "the obstacles were positioned either half - way along the channel , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : channelheleshaw](b ) , so that they were completely surrounded by the flowing foam ( ` enclosed channel ' configuration ) or they could be positioned at the end of the channel with the foam venting to the atmosphere ( ` open - ended channel ' configuration ) .",
    "the foaming solution used in all tests was @xmath13 sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) in ultra - pure water , with surface tension @xmath14  mn / m , as measured in @xcite , and viscosity @xmath15 pa@xmath16s .",
    "foam was created by blowing nitrogen , at a rate of @xmath17  @xmath18/min , through a single nozzle in the base of the vertical foam production cell ( fig .",
    "[ fig : channelheleshaw](b ) ) .",
    "this produced a monodisperse foam with a typical bubble volume @xmath19 deduced from the contact area @xmath20 between the bubble and the top glass plate , through the relation @xmath21 .",
    "we define the _ equivalent bubble radius _ as @xmath22 .",
    "the liquid fraction was estimated from the rate of decrease of the level of the foaming solution @xcite , since the gas flow rate is known .",
    "values in the range @xmath23 to @xmath24 were obtained for all the tests presented here .",
    "the hele - shaw cell was backlit by a circular ( diameter  @xmath25  cm ) fluorescent tube with a central dark background so that soap films appear white with good contrast .",
    "the motion of the foam was recorded using a @xmath26 pixel digital video camera running at @xmath27  fps . a typical image of the foam in the enclosed channel configuration is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : channelfoam ] .",
    "cm in a test section of length @xmath28  cm.,width=377 ]      basic image processing , thresholding and skeletonisation of the foam images was carried out using the imagej software package .",
    "the resultant images were then analysed using an in - house analysis program , described fully in @xcite .",
    "the image treatment procedure tracks individual bubbles to compute the velocity distribution within the test section over a rectangular mesh of @xmath29 boxes .",
    "the foam flow in the channels is a plug flow , with a uniform velocity , except in a small domain at the entrance and at the exit .",
    "we define the velocities @xmath30 and @xmath31 as the velocities in the central part of the channels 1 and 2 ( outside the entrance and exit domains ) , averaged over time .",
    "the time and space average velocity in the channel of width @xmath32 , before the separation into two channels , is called @xmath33 .",
    "two asymmetric channel configurations were investigated : the ` enclosed channel ' and the ` open - ended channel ' .",
    "the former is relevant to the continuous flow of a foam through a channel within a porous medium , while the latter is appropriate when considering the penetration of a foam into an air - filled porous medium , as well as to the flow of a foam along a channel that emerges into a larger void within a porous medium .",
    "the enclosed channel tests were carried out with a hele - shaw plate separation of @xmath34  cm .",
    "the average bubble area , @xmath20 , was in the range @xmath35 to @xmath36 @xmath37 , with an equivalent diameter of @xmath38  cm and a maximum polydispersity index of @xmath39 .",
    "the first set of tests where performed with channel dimensions of @xmath40  cm and @xmath41  cm , resulting in @xmath42  cm .",
    "the central obstacle was moved from a central position @xmath43  cm to one side in increments of @xmath44 or @xmath45  cm , to give a range of different @xmath5 and @xmath6 , with @xmath6 denoting the width of the narrow channel .",

    "the foam adopts a crystalline structure with only a few columns of bubbles ( double staircase and staircase structure ) . below a certain channel width",
    "the staircase structure becomes unstable and a transition towards a bamboo structure is observed @xcite .",
    "these structures are sensitive to both the average bubble size and the polydispersity of the foam , especially in the transition region between staircase and bamboo , where small increases or decreases in the bubble size can push the structure either way . in general , a bamboo foam is obtained when the channel width is such that @xmath48 .",
    "tests were also carried out with @xmath49  cm and @xmath50  cm ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : channelheleshaw ] ) , giving a channel width of @xmath51  cm .",
    "these ` straight - walled ' tests were carried out to determine whether the upstream corners introduced by the inclusion of the two side obstacles had any effect on the flow behaviour within the channels .",
    "no difference in the flow behaviour was found between the ` stepped ' and the straight - walled tests , and the two sets of results are presented together in the following .    in fig .",

    ". however , once the transition to a bamboo foam occurs , the flow in the narrow channel becomes much slower than in the larger one .",
    "the velocity ratio reaches a minimum for a narrow channel width of the order of @xmath54 . for very small channel widths , the velocity in the narrow channel increases again ( analogously to the findings of bertin _ et al . _",

    "the pressure distribution in the experiment is shown schematically in fig .  [",

    "the pressure drop @xmath69 can be decomposed into five contributions : ( i ) @xmath70 , due to both the viscous friction on the plates before entering the channel , and to the elasto - plastic stress in the foam , arising from the strong deformations that occur in the foam in this region ; ( ii ) @xmath71 due to a possible high film curvature at the channel entrance , inducing a laplace pressure drop ( as the bubble size may be of the order of the channel size this contribution can not be described in the frame of a continuum model and requires separate treatment ) ; ( iii ) @xmath72 due only to the viscous force exerted by the channel walls , since we have confirmed that the flow is plug - like in the two channels ; ( iv ) @xmath73 , the equivalent of ( ii ) for the exit ; and finally , ( v ) @xmath74 , the equivalent of ( i ) for the exit .",

    "however , for a more general 2d foam structure , the menisci can have an arbitrary orientation @xmath87 with respect to the channel orientation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lproj ] ) .",
    "the viscous force per unit length of meniscus decreases as @xmath87 increases . rather than the total length @xmath88 of meniscus , it was shown by cantat",
    "et al.@xcite that the projected length perpendicular to the flow determines the total viscous force exerted on a moving film , in agreement with their experimental observations .",
    "similarly , a general vectorial relation for the viscous force was proposed in @xcite : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the normal to the film .",
    "@xmath91 is the scalar viscous force , obtained from eq .  , and is defined by : @xmath92    for a 2d foam moving without deformation at a uniform velocity @xmath93 in a channel of cross - sectional area @xmath94 , the viscous pressure drop @xmath95 can be calculated from the force balance on the foam , with inertia negligible in our parameter range .",

    "the experiments in @xcite gave a value of @xmath100% for both bamboo and single staircase structures in a similar geometry .",
    "@xcite extended this work to a more extensive 2d random foam , and also considered the effect of liquid fraction .",
    "their measurements yielded the empirical relation : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the radius of curvature of the meniscus at the wall , and @xmath20 is the bubble area as seen from above .",
    "this relation holds for @xmath103 between 0.01 and 0.35 , corresponding to liquid fractions between 0.01% to 30% .",
    "the ratio @xmath104 can be calculated from the liquid fraction @xmath105 of the foam using@xcite @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the plate separation in the hele - shaw cell and @xmath108 is the bubble perimeter . @xmath109 and @xmath110 are constants associated with the shapes of the vertical and horizontal plateau borders respectively ; for a purely hexagonal foam they are@xcite @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "however , for a foam in a narrow channel the structure is generally not hexagonal : there are pentagonal bubbles at the walls , and in a very narrow channel the bubbles are rectangular ( bamboo ) .",
    "@xmath110 is independent of the individual bubble shape , but @xmath109 varies with changes to the bubble geometry . following @xcite ,",
    "it has been derived by us to be @xmath113 for regular pentagonal bubbles touching the cell side and @xmath114 for bamboo bubbles ( touching both cell sides ) .",
    "using the relevant parameters for each foam structure , depending on the liquid fraction and the bubble shape , we obtain values of @xmath82 for our experiments in the range 34 to 58 .",
    "for the bamboo structure , eq .   can be rewritten explicitly as a function of the bubble volume @xmath19 .",
    "the length of meniscus touching the wall is , per bubble , @xmath115 , with an angle @xmath116 ; @xmath117 and @xmath107 are the width and height of the channel respectively .",
    "the distance between two films is @xmath118 and so the number of films in a channel of length @xmath4 is @xmath119 .",
    "we therefore predict the pressure gradient along a channel to be    @xmath120    kovscek et al @xcite consider the case @xmath121 and the apparent viscosity of the foam @xmath122 is determined as defined by the relation @xmath123 where @xmath0 is the absolute permeability of the medium ( as defined for a newtonian fluid ) , and @xmath124 is the darcy ( or filtration , or superficial ) velocity , which in our case is the mean cross - sectional velocity : @xmath125 , @xmath126 being the porosity .",
    "the permeability @xmath0 scales as @xmath127 , i.e. @xmath128 , with @xmath129 a constant depending on the geometry .",

    "@xcite results from this @xmath131 dependence .",
    "we also note that increasing the overall flow rate ( i.e. increasing @xmath84 ) improves the efficiency of the displacement , as measured in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : pinnedbubble ] ) .",
    "the pressure reaches its maximal value @xmath155 for an external volume @xmath156 before decreasing slowly as the external volume increases .",
    "this maximal pressure has to be overcome before the flow in the channel can proceed .",
    "after rupture or depinning this film is replaced by another film and , after a short transient , the pressure reaches a value close to its maximal value again .",

    "the model captures the non - monotonous behavior , in particular the velocity jump at each structure transition ; this is strikingly different from the behavior of a newtonian fluid , which shows a smooth decrease in velocity ratio with decreasing channel width ratio .",
    "we overestimate the velocity in the narrowest channels due to the neglect of the capillary pressure , however this purely viscous model is expected to be valid for very long channels , for which the viscous pressure drop becomes much higher than the capillary pressure at the channel ends .",

    "it should be noted that , as the flux in the wide channel is much larger than the one in the narrow channel , it can be considered equal to the imposed total flux , and therefore @xmath192 can be considered constant .",

    "we checked that the analogous 2-d calculation for a rectangle of size @xmath203 , with @xmath204 leads to a very similar prediction , up to a prefactor close to 1 .",
    "the prediction is also very close to the full numerical calculation for @xmath205 ( fig.[fig : pinnedbubble ] ) .",

    "the pressure oscillation is thus only understood qualitatively , and would require a specific study , with a shape visualisation at the exit , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this situation , the average velocity in the narrow channel strongly depends on the bubble behavior at the exit ( pinning , bursting etc . ) , which was not controlled in the open - ended experiments .",

    "we have varied the relative width of the channels at fixed combined width , in order to investigate how changes in the foam structure inside the narrower channel influence the distribution of fluxes between the two channels , for a given imposed total volumetric flow rate .",
    "two geometric configurations were used , one with channels enclosed inside a larger hele - shaw cell , and another one in which the two channels vent to the open air .",
    "they are respectively relevant to ( i ) the continuous flow of a foam through a channel within a porous medium , and ( ii ) to the imbibition of a foam into an air - filled porous medium or to the flow of a foam along a channel that emerges into a void much larger than the typical bubble size .    in the bamboo regime the velocity in the narrow channel decreases as the channel width is increased .",
    "this brings a direct experimental evidence of the better foam penetration in the smallest pores that had already been observed in real 3d porous media .",
    "however , when the narrow channel becomes larger than the bubble size , the structure goes from a bamboo structure to a staircase structure .",
    "this structure transition induces an abrupt increases of the velocity in the narrow channel which dominates over the slow decreases of the velocity with increasing channel width previously discussed . eventually , when the narrow channel is in the random foam regime ( with bubble size much smaller than channel width ) , the velocity becomes independent of the channel width .",
    "a theoretical model accounting only for the viscous dissipation at the contact between the complex menisci network and the bounding plates allows us to qualitatively predict the smooth decrease of the velocity in the narrow channel , and the sudden jumps at the structure transitions observed when the narrow channel width increases . taking into account corrections induced by the capillary pressure across the films pinned at the channel outlet leads to an almost quantitative velocity prediction , although the theory overestimates to some extent the velocity in the narrower channel .",
    "this work improves our understanding of the better foam penetration in the smallest pores and underlines the strong influence of the local organisation of the foam . for configurations of open - ended channels with a very narrow channel ,",
    "the pinning effect at the channel exit is much more important and the flow of the bamboo foam becomes intermittent .",
    "the flow is periodically brought close to a halt while the capillary pressure across the bubble pinned at the channel outlet builds up , until that bubble bursts or depins .",
