    "various superconducting nanocircuits have been proposed as quantum bits ( qubits ) for a quantum computer .",
    "@xcite in the meantime , it has long been recognized that background charge fluctuations can severely limit the performance of microelectronic devices , particularly those based on the manipulation of electrical charge , such as single electron transistors  @xcite and superconducting cooper - pair boxes ( cpbs ) .",
    "@xcite the struggle to suppress or even eliminate noise from charge fluctuations in superconducting devices has been a prolonged battle with limited success . here , instead of focusing on perfecting materials , we propose an alternative experimentally - realizable method to suppress the effects of these charge fluctuations using two strongly ( capacitively ) coupled cpbs .",
    "cooper - pair boxes are one of the prominent candidates for qubits in a quantum computer .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite have revealed quantum coherent oscillations in two cpbs coupled capacitively and demonstrated the feasibility of a conditional gate as well as creating macroscopic entangled states .",
    "scalable quantum - computing schemes ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) have also been proposed based on charge qubits .",
    "clearly , effective suppression of charge noise is essential to the practical implementation of scalable quantum computing in a charge - based scheme .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that while operating at the degeneracy point ( where the two lowest charge states have the same energy in the absence of josephson coupling ) , the charge qubit has a long decoherence time of @xmath0 ns .",
    "however , when the charge qubit is operated away from the degeneracy point , it experiences strong dephasing by the charge fluctuations , and the decoherence time of the system is greatly reduced .",
    "@xcite    two separate cpbs generally experience uncorrelated charge fluctuations as they are most strongly affected by their own gate biases and the nearest fluctuating charge traps . however , if the two boxes are strongly coupled capacitively ( with no tunnel coupling so that the two - box states do not approach those of a single large box in the strong coupling limit ) , the fluctuations affecting one box will affect the other through coulomb interaction . in the limit of extremely strong inter - box coupling ( corresponding to a very large mutual capacitance between the two cpbs ) , the two boxes would experience an identical charge environment , so that , in principle , a decoherence - free subspace  @xcite could be established for coupled - box states .",
    "however , in reality this limit involves many degenerate charge states for the electrostatic energy of the coupled boxes , so that logical qubit encoding is impossible .",
    "can we still achieve a decoherence - suppressed logical qubit in two capacitively coupled boxes ?",
    "below we show that there exists an intermediate parameter regime where a strong inter - box coulomb correlation induces a significant suppression of decoherence in certain two - box states , so that considerable benefit can be reaped by encoding a logical qubit in terms of these states .",
    "is applied to the @xmath1th charge box through a gate capacitance @xmath2 , and a symmetric dc - squid ( with josephson coupling energy @xmath3 and capacitance @xmath4 for each junction ) is coupled to the box .",
    "also , each box is connected to a detector via a probe junction ( or a less invasive point contact ) . when a measurement is performed , the probe junction is biased with an appropriate voltage @xmath5 .",
    "the two boxes are closely - spaced long superconducting islands with sufficiently large mutual capacitance @xmath6 , and the barrier between them is strong enough to prohibit the inter - box cooper - pair tunneling.,width=307 ]",
    "consider two capacitively coupled cpbs ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "each cpb is individually biased by an applied gate voltage @xmath7 and coupled to the leads by a symmetric dc - squid .",
    "the dc - squid is pierced by a magnetic flux @xmath8 , which provides a tunable effective josephson coupling @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the flux quantum .",

    "the charging energy @xmath13 of the @xmath1th superconducting island and the mutual capacitive coupling @xmath14 are given by  @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total capacitance of the @xmath1th island .",
    "the offset charge is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the background charge , and @xmath21 is induced by both the gate voltage @xmath7 and the probe voltage @xmath5 .",
    "the average phase drop @xmath22 across the two josephson junctions in the dc - squid is conjugate to the cooper pair number @xmath23 on the box .",
    "both cpbs operate in the charging regime @xmath24 and at low temperatures @xmath25 .",
    "the states of the two coupled boxes can thus be expanded on the basis of the charge eigenstates @xmath26 so that @xmath27 we have @xmath28 where @xmath29 notice that when @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 essentially represents the charging energy of individual josephson junctions , while @xmath33 represents the charging energy of the large capacitor @xmath6 , so that @xmath34 .     for @xmath35 .",

    "the symmetry in these states indicates that they are well insulated from pure dephasing and relaxation due to charge noise , as we will show below .",
    "it is thus quite natural to adopt these two coupled - box states @xmath44 to encode a logical qubit .",
    "below we calculate the dephasing and relaxation properties of the @xmath44 states and discuss how they can be coherently manipulated .",
    "to clarify the origin of the correlated environments for the two coupled cpbs , we study the fluctuations  @xcite of the reduced offset charge @xmath45 , which could originate from the gate voltage @xmath7 , probe voltage @xmath5 , and background charge @xmath20 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between the charge noise and the coupled cpbs takes the form @xmath46 we can use the language of a two - level system to describe each of the cpbs around the degeneracy point @xmath47 and rewrite the system hamiltonian in terms of the pauli matrices : @xmath48 \\sigma_{zi } - { 1\\over 2 } e_{ji}(\\phi_i ) \\sigma_{xi}\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) . here",

    "though each cpb is directly coupled to its own charge environment , the inter - island coulomb interaction in terms of @xmath14 ensures that the environment is partly shared between the two islands , causing the cpbs to experience correlated noises . indeed , notice that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_i_delta ] ) the first part of the hamiltonian should not lead to dephasing between the @xmath44 states since it affects both identically . when each of the two environments is modeled by a thermal bath of simple harmonic oscillators described by the annihilation ( creation ) operator @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , the hamiltonian of the whole system , including the two baths , is @xmath57 with @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) . here",

    "the prefactor takes the value @xmath81 , so that the dephasing time is two orders of magnitude longer than when the boxes are only weakly coupled .",
    "this is in strong contrast to the corresponding single cpb expression for pure dephasing @xmath82 for the @xmath83 noise arising from the background charge fluctuations , the power spectrum is @xmath84 and @xmath76 can be written as  @xcite @xmath85 where the cutoff frequency @xmath86 , with @xmath87 being the decoherence time of the system .",
    "the above calculation focuses on the pure dephasing of the coupled boxes and is applicable to parameter regimes away from the double degeneracy point @xmath88 at the degeneracy point , we can estimate the effects of the charge fluctuations by directly projecting the system - environment coupling hamiltonian ( [ eq : h_i ] ) into the @xmath44 basis .",
    "the matrix elements are @xmath89 from the first equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_i_pm ] ) , @xmath90 so that there is no pure dephasing between @xmath91 and @xmath92 states as the charge fluctuations affect both identically . on the other hand , the second equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_i_pm ] ) , i.e. , the transition matrix element , dictates that charge fluctuation does lead to relaxation between these two states . using the spin - boson model above",
    ", one can calculate this transition rate straightforwardly . here",
    "we emphasize that compared to a single cpb , the system - reservoir interaction strength is @xmath33 instead of @xmath32 , just like in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta(t ) ] ) for pure dephasing .",
    "furthermore , charge fluctuations that couple to the two boxes equally will not lead to relaxation because the coupling here is proportional to @xmath93 .    in short ,",
    "a pair of capacitively coupled cpbs can have strongly suppressed pure dephasing and relaxation around the degeneracy point because of the reduced interaction strength .",
    "therefore @xmath44 are perfect candidates to encode a logical qubit . moreover , as shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "the two lowest levels are very separated from the higher levels in the coupled cpbs and the leakages from the qubit states to the higher - level states can be negligibly small .",
    "in contrast , for the single cpb qubit in the charge - flux regime where the charging energy is reduced ,  @xcite the two lowest levels are not well separated from the higher levels  @xcite and appreciable leakages are expected .",
    "coherence - preserving quantum states can be prepared as follows .",
    "first , consider an initial point on the @xmath94@xmath95 plane close to @xmath96 . here",
    "the system ground state is @xmath97 .",
    "then , shifting adiabatically ( e.g. , along the @xmath98 direction ) to the region around the degeneracy point , we arrive at the coherence - preserving ground state @xmath91 .",
    "now , using a two - frequency microwave to interact with the system for a period of time ( basically a raman process ) , as in the case of trapped ions ,  @xcite one can obtain any superposition of @xmath44 states , so that an arbitrary single qubit operation is feasible .",
    "readout of the logical - qubit states can be achieved by various approaches .",
    "for instance , one can rotate the logical qubit states to the charge eigenstates @xmath99 and @xmath100 , so that simple charge detection using , for example , single electron transistors , can determine the state of the coupled cpbs . in the case of probe junction detection ( fig .  1 and ref .  ) , when appropriate bias voltages @xmath5 are applied to the probe junctions , the measured current @xmath101 through the @xmath1th probe junction is proportional to the probability for the @xmath1th box to have a cooper pair in it .",
    "decoherence in two coupled qubits  @xcite and during a conditional gate  @xcite have attracted much attention recently .",
    "it has been shown that a decoherence - free subspace exists for two physical qubits coupled to the same bath .",
    "@xcite recently , zhou _  et  al_.  @xcite proposed an encoded qubit using a pair of closely spaced cpbs sharing a common lead , and the two boxes were assumed to couple to an identical bath . in their proposed setup ,",
    "fluctuations originating from the gate voltage may be identical because of the common lead .",
    "however , the background charge fluctuations  @xcite can not be so since these fluctuations originate from local charge traps near each box . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_i_delta ] ) , an identical bath could only be achieved in the presence of inter - box interaction and in the limiting case of @xmath102 .",
    "unfortunately , at this limit , the two - level - system description for the individual cpb breaks down . thus the proposed ideal single - bath scenario can never be achieved in the presence of background charge fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in our study of the coupled cpbs here , though the ideal single - bath case can not be realized to obtain a decoherence - free subspace , the strong inter - box coupling does enable a coherence - preserving logical qubit where the correlated baths lead to suppression of decoherence in the coupled cpbs .",
    "we emphasize that the encoding idea presented here is based on actively employing the inter - box interaction to correlate different environments experienced by the individual physical qubits .",
    "this goes beyond the decoherence - free subspace concept , where symmetry alone is used ( passively ) to combat noise from a naturally existing common environmental reservoir to all the qubits .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that in two strongly capacitively coupled cpbs , the charge fluctuations experienced by the two boxes are strongly correlated .",
    "the inter - box coulomb correlation creates a two - box subspace of two states in which pure dephasing and relaxation are strongly suppressed due to the correlated noises .",
    "these two coupled cpbs can therefore be used to encode a logical qubit that possesses superior coherence properties .",
    "we have also discussed how such logical qubits can be manipulated and measured .",
