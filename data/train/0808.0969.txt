    "continuing our study on the integrability and linearization of coupled second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( snodes ) , in the present paper , we focus our attention on the linearization of two coupled snodes .",
    "the present study arises not only for the completeness of part iv ( chandrasekar _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) but also to show the importance of unfinished tasks that exist in the theory of linearization of two coupled snodes . as far as the first point is concerned",
    ", we show that one can also solve a class of coupled second order nonlinear odes by transforming them into two second order free particle equations and from the solutions of the latter one can construct the solution of the former , even though this is a nontrivial problem in many situations ( one can also transform coupled nonlinear odes into uncoupled nonlinear ones , which has already been pointed out by us in the previous paper , part iv ) . regarding the second point , we wish to stress the fact that linearization of coupled nonlinear odes is a vast area of research which is still in its early stage . in this paper , we show that in spite of the difficulties that exist in this topic , one can make useful progress on certain issues , namely ( i ) developing a method to deduce all linearizing transformations wherein the new dependent variables are functions of the old dependent and independent variables only and not derivatives of the dependent variables , and ( ii ) developing a method of constructing solutions of nonlinear odes from the linear ones in the case of non - point transformations .    even though the modern theory of linearization of nonlinear odes had originated and developed with the works of lie , tresse and cartan ( mahomed & leach 1989 ; steeb 1993 ; olver 1995 ; ibragimov 1999 ; chandrasekar _ et al .",
    "_ 2005 ) , the entire subject was lying dormant for more than a century . only recently",
    ", during the past two decades or so , notable progress has been made to linearize nonlinear odes through non - point ( duarte _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) or generalized transformations ( chandrasekar _ et al .",
    "for example , focussing our attention on single second order odes , generalized sundmann ( euler _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ; euler _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) and generalized linearizing transformations ( chandrasekar _ et al .",
    "_ 2006 ) have been introduced to linearize a class of equations that can not be linearized by invertible point transformations .",
    "as far as two coupled snodes are concerned , to our knowledge , most of the studies were focussed only on invertible point transformations irrespective of whether it is an analytical approach or a geometrical formulation . for",
    "a survey on this topic one may refer the recent papers of merker ( 2006 ) and mahomed & qadir ( 2007 ) and for the earlier works in this direction we cite crampin _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) , fels ( 1995 ) , grossman ( 2000 ) , soh & mahomed ( 2001 ) and qadir ( 2007 ) .",
    "more recently sookmee & meleshko ( 2008 ) proposed a new algorithm to linearize the coupled second order odes by sequentially reducing the order of the equation .    in this work",
    "we aim to give a new dimension to the theoretical development of linearization of nonlinear dynamical systems having two degrees of freedom by proving that one can unearth a wide class of linearizing transformations besides invertible point transformations .",
    "of course , the latter ones form a sub - class of the new ones which we construct in this paper . in the present study",
    ", we not only derive several new types of linearizing transformations but also propose systematic procedures to derive the general solution in all these cases .",
    "we also wish to emphasize here that we derive all these transformations from the first two integrals alone and thereby establish a potentially simple , straightforward and powerful approach in the theory of differential equations .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "we briefly describe the method of deriving linearizing transformations for a system of two coupled second - order odes .",
    "we show that one can have two classes of linearizing transformations , depending upon the nature of the independent variables . if the new independent variables are the same ( @xmath1 ) , we put them in class - a category , and if they are different ( @xmath2 ) , then we put them in class - b category . in ",
    "we consider class - a category and identify three types of linearizing transformations . in ",
    "we consider class - b category and identify six types of linearizing transformations . in ",
    "3 we consider one specific example for each of the nine types of linearizing transformations we have identified , and obtain general solution to each one of them to demonstrate our procedure . finally , we present our conclusions in  4 .",
    "to begin with let us consider a system of two coupled second order nonlinear odes , @xmath5 , ( vide equation ( 2.1 ) in part iv ( chandrasekar _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 ) ) , @xmath6 any transformation of the form @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 which transforms the given set of nonlinear odes ( [ eq01 ] ) to the free particle equations , @xmath9 is called a linearizing transformation in the present work .",
    "let @xmath10 be the two first integrals of motion of the coupled system ( [ eq01 ] ) and that they can be explicitly found , if they exist , for example , by using generalized modified prelle - singer ( ps ) method formulated in paper iv ( chandrasekar _ et al .",
    "then the following theorem ensures that the transformation can be deduced from the @xmath11 s , @xmath12 .",
    ".2 cm _ * theorem : * suppose a given nonlinear system @xmath5 of odes ( [ eq01 ] ) is linearizable to a system of two uncoupled free particle equations through the linearizing transformation @xmath7 of the form ( [ lintra01 ] ) , then the latter can be deduced from the first integrals @xmath13 , @xmath12 . _",
    ".2 cm _ proof : _ let us re - express each of the functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 in ( [ met13aa ] ) as a product of two new functions , that is , @xmath16 again rewriting @xmath17 and @xmath18 as total time derivatives of another set of functions , say @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , that is @xmath21 and @xmath22 , equation ( [ met13b ] ) can be further recast as @xmath23    now identifying the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 as the new dependent variables , equation ( [ met13d ] ) can be further recast in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the redefined constants .",
    "obviously , ( [ met13h ] ) follows straightforwardly from ( [ met13 g ] ) .",
    "consequently the new variables , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath12 , defined by equation ( [ lintra01 ] ) help us to transform the given set of coupled snodes into two linear second order odes which in turn lead to the solution by trivial integration .",
    "the variables @xmath30 s and @xmath29 s , @xmath31 then define the linearizing transformations for the given equation ( [ eq01 ] ) .",
    "@xmath32    it may be noted that in general the new dependent variables , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , may also involve @xmath35 and @xmath36 , that is @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and this possibility may lead us to identify more generalized transformations like point - contact and generalized - contact transformations .",
    "however , in this paper we will confine ourselves only to the forms of @xmath33 and @xmath34 given by ( [ lintra01 ] ) .",
    "an important question which we will focus upon in the present paper is that what are the possible forms of linearizing transformations one can unearth through the above procedure .",
    "we recall here that in the case of scalar snodes , one has point , generalized sundman and generalized linearizing transformations ( chandrasekar _ et al . _",
    "2005;2006 ) .",
    "as far as the coupled snodes ( [ eq01 ] ) are concerned , since there are two independent variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 as given in equation ( [ lintra01 ] ) , one can choose them to be either the same , @xmath1 ( class - a ) , or different , @xmath2 ( class - b ) .",
    "in the case of class - a transformations , one can construct three different types of linearizing transformations , while for class - b one can formulate six different types of linearizing transformations , as we point out below .",
    "however , we also note that even further types of local transformations involving the variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 are possible but these are not included in the present study .      in the case of class a transformations we have @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "now appropriately restricting the form of @xmath17 @xmath43 , one can identify three different types of linearizing transformations .    1 .",
    "suppose @xmath39 is a perfect differential function and @xmath30 s , @xmath31 and @xmath44 do not contain the variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 , then we call the resultant transformation , namely , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , as a point transformation of type - i .",
    "2 .    on the other hand",

    ". 3 .    as a more general case ,",
    "if we consider the independent variable @xmath44 to contain the derivative terms also , that is @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath49 , then we call the resultant transformation as a generalized linearizing transformation of type - i .    in our analysis , we do not consider the possibility @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath50 because the procedure to handle it is different from the presently discussed linearizing transformations .",
    "this possibility will be studied separately .      in the class - b type of linearizing transformations",
    "we have @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",

    "we point out that the nonlinear system ( [ fcou10 ] ) admits amplitude independent frequency of oscillations .    in the above example",
