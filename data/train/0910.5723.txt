    "observations of the low - redshift universe are unable to account for a large fraction of the baryons predicted by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and nucleosynthesis measurements ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological simulations predict that most of these elusive baryons reside in a diffuse , warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim , hereafter ) with temperatures in the range @xmath0 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "theoretical models agree with numerical simulations that the relatively high temperature of the whim is produced by gravitational heating ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "when large - scale structures form by gravitational collapse , cosmological shock waves are driven into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and heat the gas to temperatures much greater than @xmath7 .",
    "the detection of the whim in the low - redshift universe requires observations in the ultraviolet ( uv ) and in the soft x - ray  bands ( see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "unfortunately , uv and x - ray  absorption lines are more technically challenging to detect than optical lines , and require satellites outside the earth s atmosphere .",
    "in addition , the low density of the whim implies that its surface brightness is extremely low , making it nearly impossible to detect in emission with current instruments such as _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  and the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ fuse _   ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite claim to have detected continuum emission with _ xmm - newton _  from a filament extending between the two large clusters abell 222 and abell 223 at @xmath8 significance , thanks to the orientation of the filament along the line of sight . @xcite and @xcite also found evidence for diffuse thermal emission from whim gas in two _ rosat _  fields , corresponding to an overdensity of galaxies at @xmath9 @xcite and to the scultor wall .",
    "absorption lines are less biased towards high gas densities and may therefore be more sensitive to the low - density whim .",
    "there are a few controversial claims of detection of o  absorption lines in the spectrum of mrk 421 ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ; @xcite ) and from the sculptor wall @xcite .",
    "future satellites such as the international x - ray  observatory ( _ ixo _  hereafter , see also @xcite and @xcite ) and _ xenia _ @xcite will be ideal to detect a large number of whim absorption lines in the spectra of qso and gamma - ray bursts , respectively ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "although x - ray  absorption lines are a powerful tool to investigate the physical properties of the whim , the information they yield has the limitation of being 1-dimensional , unless close quasar pairs can be found in large numbers .",
    "while absorption lines are not ideal to reconstruct the 3-dimensional distribution of the gas , emission lines do just that : they effectively map the 2-dimensional distribution of the whim on the sky , and by means of their spectral redshift they trace the distribution of the gas along the 3rd dimension .",
    "detecting emission from the whim is likely to be much more challenging than detecting absorption , but the reward is comparatively large .",
    "it is therefore paramount to predict accurately what level of emission can be expected , in order to build instruments and satellites adequate to the task .",
    "the spatial distribution of metals in the igm , as traced by the whim emission , also provides important clues for understanding the metal enrichment history of the universe .",
    "the distance travelled by metals between the sites of star formation and the lower density igm can constrain the energy budget of processes such as galactic winds and agn feedback .    in this work",
    ", we use a subset of runs taken from the over - whelmingly large simulations ( owls , hereafter ) project @xcite to investigate which emission lines in the soft x - ray  band best trace the low - redshift whim emission .",
    "we will do the same for uv emission in a companion paper ( bertone et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we estimate the level of the emission in a simulated cubic region of 100 @xmath10  comoving mpc on a side and discuss the observability of the whim by future telescopes such as _ ixo _ , the explorer of diffuse emission and gamma - ray burst explosions ( _ edge _ , @xcite ) and _ xenia_.    the owls  runs @xcite are well - suited for this study and represent a significant step forward with respect to previous studies . owls  couples a large simulated dynamical range with a large set of models in which the implementation of many uncertain physical processes have been varied",
    "this special feature allows us to investigate the dependence of the results on different physical processes . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the strongest soft x - ray  emission lines we have identified , which are listed in table [ eltable ] , the most important being o  @xmath11 18.97   and o  @xmath11 21.60  .",
    "when more than one line corresponds to a given transition , we consider only the strongest line .",
    ".list of the emission lines considered in this work .",
    "the first column shows the name of the emission line , the second and the third columns the wavelength and the energy of the transition , respectively .",
    "the last column identifies the type of ion responsible for the transition ( e.g.  `` h '' means h - like ) and the letter in parentheses indicates the transition for the case of triplets from he - like atoms : resonance ( r ) , forbidden ( f ) and intercombination ( i ) . [ cols=\"<,>,<,>,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ exper ]    in this section we discuss the possibility that current and future x - ray  telescopes may detect the whim emission at the levels predicted by our simulations .",
    "previous studies predict that x - ray  emission from the whim is far below the detection threshold of the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  telescopes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "predictions that whim emission lines in filaments could be detected by _ xmm - newton _  have not been confirmed @xcite .",
    "however , future missions such as _ edge _  @xcite , _ ixo _  and _ generation - x _",
    "@xcite , have been shown to have a better chance of detecting diffuse emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "ideally , the emission from the whim requires an instrument which couples a large field of view ( fov , hereafter ) with high angular and spectral resolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . while instruments with high angular and spectral resolutions alone are fine for searches of absorption features , a large fov is desirable for mapping diffuse emission .",
    "high angular resolution is also very important , as we found that the emission is dominated by bright , compact regions . without sufficient angular resolution , it will not only be more difficult to detect the emission , but one would also risk misinterpreting its origin .",
    "for example , emission that looks smooth and filamentary at poor angular resolution may come from unresolved , dense knots rather than from diffuse , low density gas .",
    "a few dedicated small to medium - size missions have been proposed to investigate the whim emission . the missing baryon explorer ( _ mbe _ , @xcite ) was the first of such medium - size missions , later followed by the diffuse intergalactic oxygen surveyor ( _ dios _ , @xcite ) , the extreme physics in the transient and evolving cosmos ( _ estremo _ , @xcite ) , _ edge _  @xcite and _ xenia _",
    "the last two missions are very similar .",
    "the common goal of all these missions is to build an instrument with a large fov and high spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "the proposed technical specifications of the instruments we consider are listed in table [ exper ] .",
    "the fov of the x - ray  microcalorimeter spectrometer ( xms ) on board _ ixo _  is @xmath12 , which corresponds to 1.1 @xmath10  comoving mpc at @xmath13 . also on _ ixo",
    "_ , the wide field imager ( wfi , @xcite ) has a fov of @xmath14 , corresponding to 3.7 @xmath10  comoving mpc at the same redshift .",
    "both instruments have sufficient coverage to image gas in filaments at @xmath15 , with an angular resolution of 5 `` each . for comparison , the wide field imager ( wfi ) and",
    "the wide field spectrometer ( wfs ) on _ xenia _  were proposed to have fovs of 1 and 0.7  degrees and angular resolutions of 15 '' and 3.7 , respectively .",
    "while xms on _ ixo _  and wfs on _ xenia _  have impressive energy resolutions of about 3  ev , it is much worse for the wfis ( 150  ev for _ ixo _  and 70  ev for _ xenia _ ) .",
    "the unresolved cosmic x - ray background has been measured to be @xmath16  photon s@xmath3 @xmath4 sr@xmath3  kev@xmath3 in the range 0.5  1  kev ( @xcite ) and is thought to be dominated by diffuse galactic and local thermal - like emission . for the energy resolution of the xms ( @xmath17  ev )",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath18  photon s@xmath3 @xmath4 sr@xmath3 .",
    "the instrumental background for xms is about @xmath19  photon s@xmath3 kev@xmath3 per @xmath4 of the detector area ( kaastra 2010 , private communication ) . for a pixel size of @xmath20 m and 3  arcsec",
    "this corresponds to @xmath21  photon s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 kev@xmath3 . for an effective area of @xmath22 and an energy resolution of 2.5  ev",
    "this implies a limiting surface brightness of @xmath23  photon s@xmath3 @xmath4 sr@xmath3 , slightly below the extragalactic background .",
    "thus , we expect observations to become background limited below @xmath24  photon s@xmath3 @xmath4 sr@xmath3 . for an angular resolution of 15  arcsec and an effective area of @xmath22 , this surface brightness would result in about 10 detected photons per resolution element in a 1  ms exposure .",
    "hence , with an instrument like xms it would be possible to detect surface brightnesses @xmath25  photon s@xmath3 @xmath4 sr@xmath3  ( at 15 arcsec resolution ) with high confidence in reasonable exposure times .",
    "[ dense_pdf ] shows that this would enable the detection of o  from gas with @xmath26 at @xmath13 .    for the proposed wfs for _ xenia _",
    "the instrumental background is expected to be even lower and the energy resolution similar to that for xms on _ ixo_. the angular resolution is , however , much poorer ( about 4 ) and the effective area is an order of magnitude smaller ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "a 1  ms exposure would in that case yield @xmath28 photons per resolution element for a surface brightness of @xmath24  photon s@xmath3 @xmath4 sr@xmath3 , more than sufficient for a robust detection .",
    "note that xms on _ ixo _  would detect an order of magnitude more photons when averaged over the same angular size ( because its effective area is an order of magnitude larger ) .",
    "we predict from the equivalent version of fig .",
    "[ dense_pdf ] for a pixel size of 4 arcmin ( not shown ) that this surface brightness limit is sufficient to detect some o  emission from gas with @xmath29 at @xmath13 .",
    "note that while this emission would appear to be diffuse due to the low angular resolution , it would in fact come from unresolved , dense clouds .",
    "compared with the wfs , the wfi for _ xenia _  has much better angular resolution ( 15 \" ) , a smaller effective area ( about @xmath30 ) and a much worse energy resolution ( @xmath31 ev ) .",
    "because the spectral resolution is more than an order of magnitude lower than for the wfs , the backgrounds will be higher by the same factor . for reasonable exposure times",
    "( @xmath32  ms ) we would still not be background limited .",
    "the poor spectral resolution would , however , make it much more challenging to interpret the observations , as the lines correspond to the differential hubble flow across a comoving distance @xmath33mpc ( for @xmath13 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the interpretation would be greatly facilitated by the much improved angular resolution , although this will not necessarily help with the identification of the lines .",
    "the wfi for _ ixo _  has an energy resolution that is lower still , @xmath34 ev , which may lead to severe projection effects and which would make it challenging to identify the lines .",
    "while wfi does not have a better angular resolution than xms , it does have a much larger field of view ( 18  arcmin vs.  2  arcmin for the high energy resolution mode of xms ) .    according to our predictions , the wfs on _ xenia _",
    "should be able to detect strong emission from the whim only for gas with overdensities greater than a thousand , such as in the centres of groups .",
    "_ ixo _  would be extremely exciting as it would be sufficiently sensitive to detect emission from o , and probably a few other lines , from both the cores of small groups and from the outskirts of larger groups and clusters down to overdensities @xmath35 , and with an angular resolution that is sufficient to resolve much of the intrinsic structure .",
    "instruments with higher sensitivity and lower flux limits will be required in the future to image the emission from the diffuse whim in low - density regions and in filaments where @xmath36 . _",
    "generation - x _",
    "@xcite might be one of those missions .",
    "since most of the baryons contained in the whim reside at such low overdensities ( fig .",
    "[ massdis ] ) , it seems unlikely that the bulk of the baryons will be detected in soft x - ray emission any time soon .",
    "absorption experiments clearly have a better chance to accomplish this goal .",
    "however , we have seen that detecting soft x - ray emission from the gas in and around ( groups of ) galaxies is within reach of proposed missions .",
    "this is extremely exciting , as such observations would provide vital clues on gas infall , outflows and metal enrichment , which are the key , poorly understood processes in models of the formation of galaxies .",
    "gravitational accretion shocks and , to a lesser extent , galactic winds driven by supernovae and/or agn , can shock - heat the diffuse intergalactic medium to temperatures @xmath37 . at low redshifts a large fraction of the baryons",
    "are thought to reside in this warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ; @xmath0 ) and soft x - ray emission lines from metals offer a way to detect them .    here , we used a subset of cosmological simulations from the overwhelmingly large simulations ( owls ) project @xcite to study the nature and detectability of this emission .",
    "these simulations are among the largest dissipative runs ever performed , and use new prescriptions for a range of baryonic processes , such as star formation , galactic winds driven by massive stars and supernovae , and feedback from agn .",
    "of particular relevance for us , is that they are fully chemodynamical , tracking the delayed release of 11 different elements by massive stars , supernovae of types ii and ia , and asymptotic giant branch stars , and that radiative cooling is implemented element - by - element in the presence of an evolving uv / x - ray background .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the strongest emission in the soft x - ray  band comes from the o  line , whose emissivity peaks at a temperature of a few times @xmath38 .",
    "a large number of other lines are , however , only slightly weaker .",
    "emission lines from metals provide strong constraints on the temperature of the emitting gas .",
    "most of the emitted radiation and essentially all of the potentially detectable flux comes from gas with temperatures close to the peak of the emissivity curve for a collisionally ionised gas . because of the quadratic dependence of the emissivity on density , the emission traces neither the bulk of the baryonic nor the bulk of the metal mass . instead , the emission is dominated by metal - rich gas at very high overdensities in and around galaxies . since the peak temperature of the emissivity increases with atomic number and ionisation state , lines from heavier or more highly ionised atoms trace hotter gas . as such , c  and o  trace gas with @xmath39 ,",
    "o , ne  and fe  gas with @xmath40 , and ne , mg , si  and s  gas with @xmath41 k. 3 .   by comparing results from different owls  models , we have investigated the dependence of the results on a number of physical mechanisms .",
    "it is essential to accurately model the cooling rates .",
    "in particular , studies that neglected metal - line cooling are not self - consistent and will have overestimated the maximum fluxes by about an order of magnitude . without galactic winds , the pdf of the flux shifts to much lower values . however , the high - flux tail , which will become detectable first , is surprisingly robust to strong variations in the strength of the winds , remaining similar even when galactic winds are turned off or when violent agn feedback is included .",
    "while assuming a constant metallicity of @xmath42 reduces the width of the flux pdf ( and thus suppresses the maximum fluxes ) , the relative differences between the models remain similar .",
    "this suggests that the different feedback processes mainly affect the metal - line emission by changing the gas densities in and around galaxies , as the highest fluxes always come from regions with temperatures close to the peak of the emissivity curve and with ( local ) metallicities @xmath43 .",
    "soft x - ray  emission lines in the low - redshift universe are likely to be detectable only for relatively high - density regions , such as groups and the outskirts of clusters .",
    "because dense , compact structures can easily dominate the emission even if they contain only a very small amount of mass , it is important for future observatories to have high angular resolution . without sufficient angular resolution",
    ", the emission is harder to detect and one risks misinterpreting the origin of the detected emission .",
    "for example , emission that looks diffuse may in reality come from a number of compact gas clouds in and around galaxies that trace the large - scale structure . 5 .",
    "while soft x - ray line emission is too faint for it to be a promising route to close the baryon budget , it does offer the exciting possibility to image the gas accreting onto and flowing out of galaxies .",
    "currently proposed missions could provide vital clues on some of the most poorly understood , but crucial ingredients of models of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "we would like to thank jelle kaastra for invaluable help with the physics of x - ray  emission and for suggesting to look at the different o  components .",
    "we are grateful to volker springel and all other members of the owls  team for their help during the development of this project and to tesla jeltema for reading the manuscript .",
    "we also acknowledge useful discussions with many members of the _ estremo _ , _ edge _  and _ xenia _  teams .",

    "the flux pdfs converge for intermediate flux values , but diverge at the lowest fluxes .",

    "the pdf is proportional to the slice thickness.,width=317 ]    in this appendix we describe how varying the thickness of the slices in which we divide the simulation box affects the flux pdf . in fig .",
    "[ thick_pdf ] we show this by comparing the flux pdfs , normalised by the slice thickness , for the four different , evenly - spaced slice thicknesses of 40 , 20 , 10 and 5 @xmath10  mpc .    in the potentially detectable regime , the results appear to be independent of the slice thickness when the flux pdf is normalised by the slice thickness .",
    "in other words , the pdf in the high flux regime is proportional to the slice thickness .",
    "this is expected if the slice is sufficiently thick to fully contain the objects giving rise to the emission , but sufficiently thin for the superposition of multiple structures to be unimportant .",
    "the shape of the pdf at low fluxes , instead , depends on the level of the flux in low - density regions and on the number of low - density structures such as filaments that could be found in each slice , which is dependent on the slice thickness . as a consequence ,",
    "the actual width of the pdf at intermediate fluxes scales with the inverse of the slice thickness and the number of pixels at the lowest fluxes increases for decreasing slice thickness .",
    "when creating the slices , we neglect the peculiar velocities of particle , selecting them only according to their position within the simulation box .",
    "this is justified for a large slice thickness , when the peculiar velocities are small compared with the difference in the hubble flow across the slice .",
    "because the effect of particle displacement is small . however , it may have a small effect on the predicted fluxes for the 5 @xmath10  mpc slices , which corresponds to @xmath58 at @xmath13 ."
