    "the cancer treatment with hadron beams has seen rapid developments in clinical use over the past 10 - 15 years@xcite .",
    "today about 70 proton and carbon - ion therapy centers are in operation all over the world@xcite .",
    "when a proton or an ion travels in matter , most of its energy is deposited very close to the end of the trajectory .",
    "this is called the bragg - peak mechanism .",
    "because of this the high - dose bragg peak can be delivered to the tumor by modulating the beam energy .",
    "the dose delivered to the surrounding healthy tissue is less compared to x - ray radiation therapy and can be minimized further by varying the incident direction of the ion beam .",
    "a standard hadron therapy facility consists of ion sources , an accelerator to bring the ions to hundreds of @xmath7 , and beam delivering systems to transport the ion beam to a clinic and then to the tumor . in the active spot - scanning delivery system ,",
    "the scanning magnets deflect the pencil beam to the required transverse position and the accelerator modulates the beam energy to deliver the bragg peak of the beam to the required longitudinal position@xcite .    to ensure accurate delivery of a prescribed dose to the tumor , the beam monitor system is required to measure the beam s intensity , centroid position and profile in real time .",
    "the beam monitor must also have low material budget to reduce the disturbances to the beam .",
    "currently parallel - plate ionization chambers with one large electrode or electrodes segmented in strips@xcite or pixels@xcite are commonly used at hadron therapy facilities to monitor the beam online .",
    "the ionization chambers can measure the beam with a position resolution sub - millimeter and intensity accuracy about 1@xmath6 that are the general requirements of hadron therapy@xcite .",
    "we are developing an online beam monitor that is based on tpc ( time projection chamber ) detection principle@xcite .",
    "eight silicon pixels sensors , _ _",
    "topmetal-@xmath0__@xcite , are used as the anode array .",
    "this beam monitor measures the position of the beam with a better than 20 @xmath1 m resolution and the angle of the beam with about 0.5@xmath5 resolution .",
    "these characteristics improve the control of beam and the accuracy of hadron therapy .",
    "in part 2 we describe the silicon pixel charge sensor _",
    "topmetal-@xmath0 _ and the design of the beam monitor that uses this sensor .",
    "we show the measurement results at hirfl in part 3 and the comparison with the ionization chambers in part 4 .",
    "the beam monitor developed for hadron therapy locates at the end of a beam line , in ambient air and at room temperature .      _",
    "topmetal-@xmath0 _ is a charge sensor , fabricated using a cmos 0.35 @xmath1 m technology .",
    "the sensor has @xmath8 pixels .",
    "each pixel size is about @xmath3 @xmath1m@xmath4 .",
    "this leads to a charge sensitive region of @xmath9 mm@xmath4 . with the readout circuits",
    "the sensor area is @xmath10 mm@xmath4 .",
    "each pixel has a @xmath11 @xmath1m@xmath4 exposed top layer metal pad ( hence the name topmetal ) , a charge sensitive amplifier ( csa ) , an analog readout channel and a digital readout channel .",
    "the metal pad collects charge .",
    "the csa converts the charge into an analog voltage signal . as we only use the the analog readout of the senor in the monitor",
    ", we will not discuss the digital readout in this paper .",
    "in the analog readout , the voltage signal from the csa goes through two pixel level source - follower stages and then is routed through a chip level analog buffer to be read out . the analog equivalent noise charge ( enc ) of the sensor",
    "is measured to be below 15 e- .",
    "the sensor response to injected charges is linear @xcite .",
    "we employ the tpc ( time projection chamber ) detection principle in our beam monitor design@xcite .",
    "the tpc detection principle is shown in fig.[monitor ] .",
    "_ topmetal-@xmath0 _ , being a 2-dimensional pixel charge sensor with readout , is used to collect the ionized negative charges generated by the passing beam .",
    "we use air in the volume of the tpc .",
    "when the hadron beam passes through the air between the electrodes , electrons and ionized air molecules are generated and start to drift under the influence of the drift potential .",
    "the electrons drift towards the _",
    "topmetal-@xmath0 _ sensor that is connected as the anode of the tpc .",
    "these electrons are quickly captured by neutral oxygen or water vapor in the air to form negative ions@xcite .",
    "it is these negative ions that drift to _ topmetal-@xmath0 _ and are collected .",
    "the slow drift velocity and heavy mass of these ions ( compared with electrons ) contribute to the improvements in measurement resolution .",
    "the slow drift velocity also better matches the shaping time in _ topmetal-@xmath0_.    we place two monitors in the beam with the drift field orthogonal to each other .",
    "each monitor provides a 2-dimensional projection of the beam on the anode plane .",
    "the beam profile and the incident angle are reconstructed from the two orthogonal projections .    shown in fig.[monitor ] ,",
    "eight _ topmetal-@xmath0 _ sensors are lined up to form the anode of the tpc ( the monitor ) .",
    "the anode is set to ground , while the cathode , which is 6 cm from the anode , is at -2000 v potential .",
    "the field cage is used to make electric field perpendicular to electrodes@xcite .",
    "the analog readout of the sensor uses a rolling shutter method with a 1.5625 mhz clock .",
    "the eight sensors are read out in parallel .",

    "the beam is time - continuous .",
    "the beam passes through a 30 mm long collimator and then the monitor .",
    "the collimator has two different inner diameters of 2 mm and 3 mm to choose . because in the monitor there is a gap of 5.4 mm between each sensor and this gap is the dead area , the position of the monitor is adjusted to make the two - dimensional projection of the beam passing though the collimator right on a single _ topmetal-@xmath0 _ sensor .",

    "these pixels are removed . besides , the two - dimensional projection of the beam shown in fig.[beam_angle9 ] is not smooth , which results from the nonuniformity of pixels .",
    "the nonuniformity of pixels means the responses of the pixels are different while the pixels collect the same charges .",
    "the nonuniformity of the pixels results from the different decay time constants of the pixels @xcite .",
    "the cmos technology is unable to make internal circuit of each pixel identical , which leads to the different decay time constants of the pixels .",

    ". this shall provide 2-dimensional profile of beams injected and passing over both arrays with good resolution in both x - z and y - z dimension .",
    "furthermore , this new design eliminates possible effect of dead area between neighboring sensors , since the array in each dimension contains two lines of eight sensors aligned staggered , such that whenever beam passes over space between sensors in one line , it will be caught by one sensor in the neighboring line .    in the active spot - scanning delivery system ,",
