    "ladder materials have been the focus of much theoretical and experimental work over the last few years  @xcite .",
    "these materials , which consist of planes of copper - oxygen ladders separated by charge reservoir layers of other atoms , are interesting for a number of reasons . in terms of structure and behaviour",
    "there are similarities to the high-@xmath3 cuprate materials .",
    "for example , hole doped two - leg ladders exhibit a spin gap and the doped holes form pairs with a @xmath4 structure .",
    "experimentally , a roughly linear temperature dependence of the resistivity has been observed in both doped ladders  @xcite and in the high-@xmath3 cuprates  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the copper - oxygen `` ladders '' are weakly coupled to one another , giving rise to a quasi one - dimensional system .",
    "this is interesting because there are analytical techniques for studying one - dimensional systems , and , perhaps more importantly , one - dimensional electronic systems exhibit luttinger liquid behaviour characterized by bosonic collective excitations and spin - charge separation .",
    "ladder systems provide an opportunity to study such behaviour , which is not normally found in higher dimensional systems .",
    "@xmath0 is an example of an experimentally realizable ladder compound  @xcite .",
    "this material , in comparison with other ladder materials , is easily fabricated and has received considerable attention from experimentalists .",
    "the structure of this compound consists of three unique layers : a copper - oxygen two - leg ladder layer , a @xmath5 chain layer , and a layer of @xmath6 and @xmath7 atoms . by replacing @xmath6 atoms with @xmath7 atoms ,",
    "pre - existing holes can be moved from the chains to the ladders . for @xmath8 ,",
    "the ladders are undoped and have a ground state with strong antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "conductivity measurements have been performed on @xmath0 for @xmath9 and @xmath2  @xcite . the @xmath1-axis ( parallel to the legs )",
    "resistivity , @xmath10 , and conductivity , @xmath11 , for @xmath2 are of particular interest . for this",
    "doping the resistivity shows insulating behaviour at low temperatures and metallic behaviour above @xmath12 k. the conductivity has a low - frequency peak located at a finite frequency ( @xmath13 @xmath14 ) . at higher frequencies",
    "there is considerable spectral weight .",
    "conductivity of single one - dimensional chains in the presence of either quenched disorder or umklapp processes has been studied in various theoretical papers  @xcite .",
    "the effects of quenched disorder in two - leg ladders have also been examined in detail  @xcite .",
    "in one such paper , kim  @xcite explains the low temperature insulating behaviour and the low frequency optical conductivity peak of the @xmath0 two - leg ladder .",

    "it has been suggested  @xcite that disorder , in the presence of pairing fluctuations , may provide an explanation provided spin fluctuations are suppressed by the presence of a gap .",
    "the purpose of this paper will be to examine the roles which quenched disorder and umklapp processes play in these regimes .",
    "specifically , we demonstrate that disorder can not be responsible for the observed phenomena whereas umklapp processes provide a plausible explanation , as they do for the high-@xmath3 cuprates  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , we argue that the scaling results of sec .  [ sec : scale ] apply to the @xmath17 two - leg ladder .",
    "we also discuss how perturbative calculations of conductivity , which should be valid at energies well above the charge and spin gap energies , are also valid , at least qualitatively , until localization effects take over at low energies . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pert ] , we perform perturbative calculations for conductivity using the memory function formalism , in analogy with giamarchi s calculation  @xcite for the single chain with umklapp processes . finally , in sec .  [",

    "it has been shown that quenched disorder , whether in the presence of pairing fluctuations alone or in the presence of pairing and spin fluctuations , does not contribute a monotonically increasing temperature dependence to the resistivity at high @xmath16 . however , if spin and pairing fluctuations persist down to the charge localization temperature , then umklapp process can contribute an approximately linear temperature dependence if the system is near an appropriate filling . experimental evidence from fujiyama",
