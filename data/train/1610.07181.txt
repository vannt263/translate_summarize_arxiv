    "the presence of inhibition in excitable systems induces a rich dynamical repertoire , which is extremely relevant for biological  @xcite , physical  @xcite and chemical systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , inhibitory coupling has been invoked to explain cell navigation  @xcite , morphogenesis in animal coat pattern formation  @xcite , and the rhythmic activity of central pattern generators in many biological systems  @xcite . in brain circuits",
    "the role of inhibition is fundamental to balance massive recurrent excitation  @xcite in order to generate physiologically relevant cortical rhythms  @xcite .",
    "inhibitory networks are important not only for the emergence of rhythms in the brain , but also for the fundamental role they play in information encoding in the olfactory system  @xcite as well as in controlling and regulating motor and learning activity in the basal ganglia  @xcite . furthermore , stimulus dependent sequential activation of neurons or group of neurons , reported for asymmetrically connected inhibitory cells  @xcite , has been suggested as a possible mechanism to explain sequential memory storage and feature binding   @xcite .",
    "these explain the long term interest for numerical and theoretical investigations of the dynamics of inhibitory networks .",
    "already the study of globally coupled homogeneous systems revealed interesting dynamical features , ranging from full synchronization to clustering appearance  @xcite , from the emergence of splay states  @xcite to oscillator death  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of disorder , e.g. random dilution , noise or other form of heterogeneity , in these systems leads to more complex dynamics , ranging from fast global oscillations  @xcite in neural networks and self - sustained activity in excitable systems  @xcite , to irregular dynamics  @xcite .",
    "in particular , inhibitory spiking networks , due to _ stable chaos _",
    "@xcite , can display extremely long erratic transients even in linearly stable regimes  @xcite .",
    "one of the most studied inhibitory neural population is represented by medium spiny neurons ( msns ) in the striatum ( which is the main input structure of the basal ganglia )  @xcite . in a series of papers ponzi and wickens",
    "have shown that the main features of the msn dynamics can be reproduced by considering a sparsely connected inhibitory network of conductance based neurons subject to external stochastic excitatory inputs  @xcite .",
    "our study has been motivated by an interesting phenomenon reported for this model in  @xcite : namely , upon increasing the synaptic strength the system passes from a regularly firing regime , characterized by a large part of quiescent neurons , to a biologically relevant regime where almost all cells exhibit a bursting activity , characterized by an alternation of periods of silence and of high firing .",
    "the same phenomenology has been recently reproduced by employing a much simpler neural model  @xcite . thus suggesting that this behaviour is not related to the specific model employed , but it is indeed a quite general property of inhibitory networks .",
    "however , it is still unclear the origin of the phenomenon and the minimal ingredients required to observe the emergence of this effect .    in order to exemplify the problem addressed in this paper we report in fig .",

    "the effect of inhibition is simply to reduce the number of active neurons ( _ neurons death _ ) .",
    "however , quite counter - intuitively , in presence of dilution by increasing the synaptic strength the previously silenced neurons can return to fire ( _ neurons rebirth _ ) . our aim is to clarify the physical mechanisms underlying neuron s death and rebirth , which are at the origin of the behaviour reported in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we consider a deterministic network of purely inhibitory pulse - coupled leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) neurons with an heterogeneous distribution of excitatory dc currents , accounting for the different level of excitability of the neurons .",

    "the monotonic decrease of @xmath0 with @xmath1 can be interpreted as a _ winner takes all _ ( wta ) mechanism  @xcite , where only the the most excitable neurons survive to the inhibition increase . for sparse networks ,",
    "the neurons rebirth can be interpreted as a re - activation process induced by erratic fluctuations in the synaptic currents . within this framework it is possible to obtain analytically , for instantaneous synapses , a closed set of equations for @xmath0 as well as for the average firing rate and coefficient of variation as a function of the coupling strength .",
    "in particular , the firing statistics of the network can be obtained via a mean - field approach by extending the formulation derived in  @xcite to account for synaptic shot noise with constant amplitude .",

    "the synaptic current @xmath11 is given by the linear super - position of all the inhibitory post - synaptic potentials ( ipsps ) @xmath18 emitted at previous times @xmath19 by the pre - synaptic neurons connected to neuron @xmath7 , namely @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of pre - synaptic neurons .",

    "<S> inhibition is a key aspect of neural dynamics playing a fundamental role for the emergence of neural rhythms and the implementation of various information coding strategies . </S>",
    "<S> inhibitory populations are present in several brain structures and the comprehension of their dynamics is strategical for the understanding of neural processing . in this paper , we clarify the mechanisms underlying a general phenomenon present in pulse - coupled heterogeneous inhibitory networks : inhibition can induce not only suppression of the neural activity , as expected , but it can also promote neural reactivation . in particular , for globally coupled systems , the number of firing neurons monotonically reduces upon increasing the strength of inhibition ( neurons death ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the random pruning of the connections is able to reverse the action of inhibition , i.e. in a sparse network a sufficiently strong synaptic strength can surprisingly promote , rather than depress , the activity of the neurons ( neurons rebirth ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the number of firing neurons reveals a minimum at some intermediate synaptic strength . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this minimum signals a transition from a regime dominated by the neurons with higher firing activity to a phase where all neurons are effectively sub - threshold and their irregular firing is driven by current fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the origin of the transition by deriving an analytic mean field formulation of the problem able to provide the fraction of active neurons as well as the first two moments of their firing statistics . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of a synaptic time scale does not modify the main aspects of the reported phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> however , for sufficiently slow synapses the transition becomes dramatic , the system passes from a perfectly regular evolution to an irregular bursting dynamics . in this latter regime </S>",
    "<S> the model provides predictions consistent with experimental findings for a specific class of neurons , namely the medium spiny neurons in the striatum . </S>"
