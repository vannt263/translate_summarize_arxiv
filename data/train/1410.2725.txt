    "this approach mimicked the theory of classical error correcting codes . and",
    "therefore the theory of error correction in random network coding draws some motivations from the field of classical error correcting codes .",
    "classical error correcting codes are constructed over @xmath7 . here",
    "a ` code ' is an arbitrary subset of @xmath7 and the ` codewords ' are @xmath8 length vectors whose co - ordinates are elements of @xmath9 . the distance , called the _ hamming distance _ , between two codewords is measured by the number of differing co - ordinates between the two vectors .",

    "a subspace , by definition , is an abelian group under vector addition . and",
    "it turns out that the hamming distance is translation invariant with respect to this addition .",
    "the geometry of the hamming distance combines with group structure to give a rich theory of classical binary error correcting codes @xcite .",
    "however there are a few differences between error correction coding over projective spaces and hamming spaces .",
    "if the volume of a set is defined as the number of elements in the set whenever the set is finite , one can study how the volume of a ball changes as the centre is translated .",
    "in euclidean spaces and hamming spaces , the volume of a ball is independent of its centre .",
    "but the volume of a ball is not independent of its centre in a projective space .",
    "a technical way of restating this observation is that the geometry induced by the subspace distance @xmath10 on @xmath1 is not distance - regular ( unlike the hamming space ) and one can not mimic the tricks of sphere - covering / packing bounds for the hamming space @xcite . and",
    "therefore the usual geometric intuitions fail in projective spaces . however , it turns out that restricting the projective spaces to a class of subspaces with a particular dimension gets this distance regular property .",

    "our focus is on non - constant dimension codes .",
    "even though the distance - regular property fails , one can recover a form of gilbert - varshamov bound for non - constant dimension codes @xcite and derive a form of singleton bound for the projective space @xcite .",

    "the authors discuss different possibilities of complements and linearity and they state a few conjectures .",
    "this paper is mainly focused on resolving one conjecture concerning the linearity .    a code in @xmath1 which imitates the group structure of a binary vector space and has the translation invariant property on the subspace distance",
    "is called a _ linear code in the projective space _ in @xcite .",
    "henceforth , we will just call it a linear code .",
    "one can construct such a linear code with @xmath3 codewords by identifying a basis as the generators of the group . a linear code constructed in this fashion",
    "is called _ a code derived from a fixed basis_. it follows from @xcite that @xmath1 can not be a linear code .",
    "so a maximal linear code is somewhere between these two extremes .",
    "the main conjecture claims that the largest possible cardinality of a maximal linear code must be * equal * to the cardinality of a code derived from a fixed basis .",
    "in other words , it states that the largest linear code in a projective space has a cardinality of @xmath3 . as a first step towards proving this result ,",
