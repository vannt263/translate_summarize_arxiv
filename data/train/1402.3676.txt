    "the study of population growth is applicable to many areas of knowledge , such as biology , economics and sociology @xcite . in recent years",
    ", this wide spectrum of applicability has motivated a quest for universal growth patterns that could account for different types of systems by means of the same idea @xcite . to model a more embracing context ,",
    "generalized growth models have been proposed to address different systems without specifying functional forms @xcite .",
    "these generalized models have helped guide the search for such universal growth patterns @xcite .",
    "the first population growth models were proposed to describe a very simple context or a specific empirical situation .",
    "for instance , the _ malthus model _",
    "@xcite was proposed to explain populations whose growth is strictly dependent on the number of individuals in the population , i.e. populations that have a constant growth rate .",
    "the model yields to an exponential growth of the population , and although it fits very well to some empirical data when the population is sufficiently small , it fails after a long period of time @xcite . to describe a more realistic population , verhulst introduced @xcite a quadratic term in the malthus equation to represent an environment with limited resources .",
    "the _ verhulst model _ yields to the logistic growth curve , which fits many empirical data very well ; examples includes bacterial growth and human population growth @xcite .",
    "another important model is the _ gompertz model _ , which was introduced in @xcite to describe the human life span but has many others applications @xcite .",
    "the model is a corruption of malthus s original model by the substitution of a constant growth rate with an exponentially decaying growth rate @xcite .",
    "the model yields to a asymmetric sigmoid growth curve .    in the last few decades",
    ", a search for theoretical models that aggregate as many situations as possible has been conducted ; the idea is that the larger the applicability of the model is , the better the theory is @xcite .",
    "for instance , the _",
    "richards model _ , which was introduced to describe plants growth dynamics @xcite , has the verhulst and gompertz growth models as particular cases .",
    "another model important in this context is the _ bertalanffy model _",
    "@xcite , which summarizes many classes of animal growth using the same approach .",
    "an additional model , which was introduced in @xcite , presents a generalization of the malthus and verhust models based on the generalized logarithm and exponential function . ]",
    "other types of models that deserve attention are the ones that use an expansion of the verhulst therm in a power series and apply it to multiple - species systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are models that use second - order differential equations to describe growth , and these models have been strongly corroborated by empirical data @xcite .",
    "all of the models cited above can be seen as _",
    "phenomenological models _ , because the only assumption that such models take into account in their formulation is the population s - macroscopic level - information .",
    "this information includes , for example , the population s size , density , and average quantities .",
    "the particularities of the individuals - the microscopic level - are removed from the formulation of these models .",
    "it is the thought process of most of the models presented in the literature .",
    "this approach is very appropriate , as it is difficult to know in detail the particularities of all of the components of the population .",
    "indeed , taking these details into account complicates the calculus and computations that are necessary to predict the population behavior from the model .",
    "however , finding universal patterns of growth is extremely helpful in observing how the components of the system behave .",
    "there would most likely be some types of individual behaviors that are common even in different systems .",
    "if that is the case , then one can justify the same pathern of growth being observed in completely different type of systems as a consequence of similarities at the microscopic level .",
    "it is observed in many fields of science that simple interaction rules of the components of a system can result in complex macroscopic behavior .",
    "moreover , some properties of such systems are universal , such as the same _ critical exponents _ in magnetic and fluid systems ; these properties are universal even in systems that are completely different @xcite . in the language of _ complex system theory _ , it is said that the collective behavior ( macroscopic level ) _ emerges _ from the interactions of the components of the system ( microscopic level ) .",
    "thus , the collective effects are called _ emergent behavior _ @xcite .",
    "the idea of mombach et all , that is reported in @xcite , which will hereafter be referred to as the _ mlbi model _ , was to apply emergent behavior s idea to population growth .",
    "hence , in oppositione to the common models that present modeling from a phenomenological point of view , this model is based on microscopic assumptions . as a result ,",
    "the ( non - phenomenological ) mlbi model , which was formulated in the context of inhibition patterns in cell populations , reaches many well known phenomenological growth models ( such as the malthus , verhulst , gompertz and richards models ) as an emergent behavior from individuals interactions .",
    "recently , this model was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the model that is proposed here continues the main idea of the mlbi model .",
    "however , the proposal of the present work is to increase the scope of this model . it will be considered that the individuals that constitute the population interact with each other not only through competition , as was proposed in the original mlbi model , but also through cooperation .",
    "the emergent behavior of this more embracing formulation is the _ allee effect _ , which is the property of some biological populations to increase their growth rate with increases in the population size for small population .",
    "this behavior can not be deduced from the original mlbi model .",
    "other interesting macroscopic emergent behavior from the model proposed here includes the observation of a regime of population divergence after a finite amount of time .",
    "it is interesting that this characteristic is observed in humanity s global population growth , as will be shown in the following sections of the paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first section , a model based on the interactions ( cooperation or competition ) between the individuals of the population is presented , and in the second section , it will be shown that the model can explain the allee effect in a non - phenomenological way .",
    "that is , the allee effect can be explained by the interactions between the individuals of the population .",
    "the model is tested with empirical data to justify its formulation . in the third section",
    ", it will be shown that some very important models in the literature can be obtained by changing some variables of the present model , such as the strength of the interaction , the geometry in which the population is embedded , and the spatial distribution of the population .",
    "thus , some very - know models in the literatur can be seen as special cases of the present model .",
    "the work presented here is based on the mlbi model , which was introduced in @xcite and reworked by donofrio in @xcite .",
    "the mlbi model was proposed to explain the population growth of cells by considering the inhibitory interactions between them . as a result",
    ", researchers dicovered that some very - known phenomenological models present in the literature ( such as verhulst , gompertz and richard s models ) can be obtained as consequence of the microscopic interactions between individuals .",
    "the present work follows the idea of the mlbi model , and expands its applicability to other ecological systems .",
    "in particular an expanded version of the model is presented , and cooperative interactions between individuals are introduced . then , one shows that the model can deal not only with populations of cells ( the context that inspired the original version of the model ) , but also with the population growth of some mammals and even human populations .",
    "moreover , the expanded version of the model can explain the allee effect , which is is not possible by regarding only its original version .",
    "first , consider that the replication rate @xmath0 of a single individual in a population is given by @xmath1 } } - \\text{\\small{[competition from field]}}+\\nonumber \\\\   & &   + \\text{\\small{[cooperation from field ] . } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this idea is identical to the one proposed by mombach ( in the first line of ( [ eq_text ] ) ) , except for the cooperative stimulus term ( the second line ) . following mombach et al , suppose that the intensity of the competitive interaction between two individuals decays according to the distance @xmath2 between them in the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the _ decay exponent _ ( see figure  ( [ figure_decay ] ) ) . in the present work",
    ", it will be assumed that the cooperative interaction behaves in the same way .",
    "thus , the replication rate of the @xmath5-th individual of the population has the form    @xmath6    this equation mathematically represents the idea introduced in equation  ( [ eq_text ] ) , where : @xmath7 is the self - stimulated replication of the @xmath5-th individual ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the position vectors of the individuals @xmath5 and @xmath10 , respectively , and consequently @xmath11 is the absolute distance between them ; @xmath12 is the exponent decay of the competitive interaction ( @xmath13 ) , or the cooperative interaction ( @xmath14 ) ; lastly , @xmath15 represents the strength of the competitive ( @xmath13 ) or cooperative(@xmath14 ) interaction .     a graph that represents the intensity of the interactions between two individuals as a function of the distance @xmath2 , according to some values of @xmath4 . as @xmath4 ( the exponent decay )",
    "increases , the interaction range decreases .",
    "when @xmath16 , the interaction range is infinity ; that is , the intensity of the interaction does not depend on the distance . ]",

    "a extended version of the calculus of mombach et all with respect to the sum in equation  ( [ defining_i ] ) is presented .",

    ", the model must be restricted to the case where @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , it is demonstrated in the analysis around equation  ( [ eq3 ] ) ( appendix  [ appendix_i ] ) , that @xmath28 ( which is much smaller than the population size ) .    as presented in @xcite , one can write the term on the right - hand side of expression  ( [ equationi ] ) by means of the generalized logarithm ( see appendix  ( [ appendix_lnq ] ) ) :    @xmath29    where    @xmath30    the parameter @xmath31 gives information about the relation between the decay exponent and the fractal dimension of the population . by introducing the average of the intrinsic growth rate @xmath32 , employing the definition @xmath33 , and using result  ( [ equatin_i_lnq ] ) , one obtain from  ( [ equation_dndt ] ) the _ richard - like _ model    @xmath34    the",
    "per- capita growth rate _",
    "@xmath35 gives information about the type of interaction that predominates in the population .",
    "for instance , @xmath36 means that cooperation predominates : the larger the population is , the larger the per- capita growth rate is .",
    "however , @xmath37 means that competition predominates : the larger the population is , the smaller the per- capita growth rate is .",
    "the result  ( [ equation_macro ] ) depends only on the macroscopic parameters of the system , besides to be deduced from microscopic ( or individual level ) premises .",
    "that is a remarkable result , and it was first obtained by mombach et all in the context of inhibitory interactions and is now expanded to cooperative interactions .",
    "this result represents a significant advance in the knowledge of patterns in population growth .",
    "it is because the model is not a phenomenological one , that is , it is not a model that is constructed to fit macroscopic data .",
    "the mlbi model , which was extended here , is deduced from the own individuals interactions .",
    "then , the macroscopic behavior emerges as a consequence of the interactions .    moreover , the model presented in this work is more robust than its original version .",
    "the original model is fully obtained by assuming that @xmath38 in  ( [ equation_macro ] ) . in this case , the per- capita growth rate @xmath35 is a monotonically decreasing function of the size of the population ( because if @xmath38 , then @xmath39 for any population size ) .",
    "consequently , the simpler form of expression  ( [ equation_macro ] ) , which does not present the cooperative effects , can not explain the _ allee effect_. however , if the cooperative term is considered ( @xmath40 in  ( [ equation_macro ] ) ) , the allee effect can be predicted by the model .",
    "this effect will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "the allee effect is the property of some populations to increase their per- capita growth rates with incriasing population size when the population is small @xcite .",
    "for instance , in figure  ( [ fig_allee_data ] ) , the experimental data of the per- capita growth rate of the muskox population are presented as a function of the population size . for a small population",

    "first , it was presented in section  ( [ section_model ] ) that    @xmath154    where @xmath155 , which is the kronecker s delta , was introduced to avoid the restriction in the sum . introducing the property    @xmath156    where @xmath157 is the dirac s delta , the expression  ( [ ii ] ) becames    @xmath158    in the last two expressions ,",
    "was introduced : @xmath159 , which is the euclidean dimension in which the population is embedded , and @xmath160 , which is the total ( hipper)volume ( in @xmath161 dimensions ) that contains the population .",

    ", the density of individuals at @xmath168 ( neighbors of @xmath5 ) , that is @xmath169 , can be written as    @xmath170    the density of individuals can also be thought of in terms of the scale of the system ( in conformity with @xcite ) .",
    "the volume of the system grows in the form @xmath171 , where @xmath172 is the typical size of the system .",
    "however , the number of individuals grows as the form @xmath173 , where @xmath26 is the fractal dimension formed by the spatial structure of the population . by considering @xmath2 , which is the absolute distance from @xmath5 , as a typical distance of the system",
    ", one can say that the density of individuals ( @xmath174 ) has the form    @xmath175    where @xmath77 is a constant .    using results  ( [ rho_value2 ] ) and  ( [ eq_rho ] ) in  ( [ value_i ] ) , one obtains    @xmath176    note that the integration argument does not depend on the angular coordinates .",
    "thus , one can write @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the solid angle , which implies    @xmath179    note that the only term that depends on the euclidean dimension is the solid angle , and the integral @xmath180 assumes the following values according to these tree possibilities : @xmath181 , @xmath182 ; @xmath183 , @xmath184 ; @xmath185 , @xmath186 . by introducing the constant @xmath187 , which depends only on @xmath161 ,",

    "the total number of individuals in the population can be determined by the integral    @xmath190    using equation  ( [ rho_value2 ] ) and integrating the solid angle , one obtains    @xmath191    note that the first term on the right in  ( [ eq2 ] ) and  ( [ eq3 ] ) can be zero ( indicating the absence of individuals ) or 1 ( indicating the presence of a single individual ) .",
    "these values are possible because the ratio of the individual is @xmath192 , and hence , there can be at most one individual inside the region that consists of the length between @xmath193 and @xmath192 .",

    "@xmath196 can be obtained from  ( [ eq3 ] ) , which is a function of @xmath46 according to    @xmath197    returning to relation  ( [ equation_i ] ) one finds    @xmath198.\\ ] ]    by introducing @xmath199 and the properties of the generalized logarithm ( appendix  [ appendix_lnq ] ) one obtains    @xmath200    99",
