    "in @xcite the following conjecture of morimoto s was established : if a knot @xmath14 has a single unknotting tunnel @xmath15 , then @xmath15 can be moved to be level with respect to the natural height function on @xmath0 given by a minimal bridge presentation of @xmath0 .",
    "the repeated theme of the proof is that by `` thinning '' the @xmath16-complex @xmath17 one can simplify its presentation until the tunnel is either a level arc or a level circuit .",
    "the present paper was originally motivated by two questions .",
    "one was a rather specialized conjecture of goda and teragaito : must a hyperbolic knot which has both genus and tunnel number one necessarily be a @xmath2-bridge knot ?",
    "a second question was this : once the thinning process used in the proof of @xcite stops because the tunnel becomes level , can thin position arguments still tell us more ?",
    "with respect to the second question , it turns out that there is an obstruction to further useful motion of @xmath15 that can be expressed as an element @xmath18 .",
    "surprisingly , further investigation showed that , so long as @xmath0 is _ not _",
    "@xmath2-bridge , the obstruction @xmath6 can be defined in a way completely independent of thin position and thereby can be viewed as an invariant of the pair @xmath5 . moreover , this apparently new invariant has useful properties : it is not hard to calculate .",
    "if @xmath9 , then the tunnel can be isotoped onto a minimal genus seifert surface .",
    "this , in combination with some work @xcite of eudave - munoz and uchida , verifies a conjecture of goda and teragaito @xcite in the case in which @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath19 and the tunnel is a level edge , then the tunnel can be moved so that instead of connecting two maxima ( say ) of @xmath0 , it connects two minima and vice versa .",
    "a future paper will expand on this observation , addressing the technically difficult and rather specialized case in which @xmath19 with the goal of verifying the goda - teragaito conjecture in this final case .    here",
    "are a few technical notes on conventions and notation used in the arguments that follow :    1 .   for @xmath20 a polyhedron",
    ", @xmath21 will denote a closed regular neighborhood , whereas ( abusing notation slightly ) @xmath22 will mean the closed complement of @xmath21 in @xmath23 .",
    "pairs of curves in surfaces will typically be regarded as having been isotoped to minimize the number of points in which they intersect .",
    "only occasionally is care required with this convention .",
    "for example , if a surface @xmath24 containing curves @xmath25 and @xmath26 is cut open along a circle @xmath27 and the remnants @xmath28 and @xmath29 are isotoped in @xmath30 to minimize their intersection ( not necessarily fixing @xmath31 or @xmath32 ) then when @xmath24 is reassembled , new intersections are introduced because of twisting around @xmath27 . in most contexts",
    "this wo nt matter , since it is the absence of intersections that typically complicates an argument .",
    "3 .   when put in thin position as in @xcite , a @xmath16-complex @xmath33 in @xmath34",
    "will typically be regarded as having first been made `` generic '' with respect to the given height function on @xmath34 ; that is , all vertices will be of valence @xmath35 , with two edges incident from above ( resp . below ) and one from below ( resp . above ) . at any height",
    "there will be at most one critical point or vertex .",
    "this convention leads to the following semantic problem : a process which puts @xmath33 in thin position typically terminates when an edge of @xmath33 is made level .",
    "then @xmath33 is no longer generic , but can be made generic by a small perturbation in which the height function on the edge becomes monotonic .",
    "to describe this situation we will sometimes say that the edge is a `` perturbed '' level edge .",
    "consider a standard genus two handlebody @xmath36 in @xmath34 and suppose @xmath37 are three non - parallel , non - separating meridian disks for @xmath36 , fixed throughout our discussion .",

    "let @xmath42 denote a fixed separating meridian disk of @xmath36 that is disjoint from @xmath43 and intersects @xmath44 in a single arc .",

    "one possibility is that @xmath74 lies entirely inside the ball @xmath75 .",

    "an arc in @xmath38 , such as @xmath25 , with both ends at @xmath51 , say , is called a _ wave _ based at @xmath51 . a simple counting argument ( as many ends of arcs of @xmath79 lie on @xmath51 as on @xmath52 )",

    "similarly @xmath80 unambiguously gives us an arc from @xmath52 to the other choice of @xmath47 or @xmath46 .",

    "see figure 4 .",
    "if @xmath24 and @xmath88 are two splitting spheres for @xmath70 then there is a sequence of splitting spheres @xmath108",
    "so that for @xmath109 , @xmath110 or @xmath39 .    there is an obvious ( but obviously not unique ) orientation - preserving homeomorphism @xmath111 with the property that @xmath112 and @xmath113 . by the alexander trick , @xmath114 is isotopic to the identity .",

    "indeed , if one pair of waves has its ends on @xmath53 and the other on @xmath48 then each wave from @xmath24 intersects each wave from @xmath88 in at least two points , a total of at least @xmath131 points . see figure 5 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath130 and both pairs of waves have their ends on @xmath53 ( or both on @xmath48 ) then each wave from @xmath24 intersects each pair of waves from @xmath88 in at least @xmath2 points , a total intersection of _ just the waves _ of @xmath39 points .",
    "any other arc of @xmath24 with the same slope will intersect a wave of @xmath88 , and vice versa , so @xmath24 and @xmath88 must both be disjoint from @xmath48 .",
    "following [ sphereintersect ] we can say more : the bigons determined by the intersection points bound non - separating disks , two in @xmath36 and two in @xmath102 . in our case",
    "each relevant bigon in @xmath102 are made up of a unions of arcs , each with one end on @xmath52 and one end on @xmath51 .",
    "in particular , the bigon intersects @xmath53 twice or more , always with the same orientation . but",
    "no such curve can bound a disk in @xmath102 , for the union of the solid torus @xmath132 with the disk would define a punctured lens space in @xmath34 .",
    "see figure 6 .        finally , if @xmath133 but @xmath24 has waves on @xmath53 and @xmath88 on @xmath48 , then each wave of @xmath24 intersects each wave of @xmath88 in at least ( hence exactly ) two points . because of the waves , any further component of @xmath83 would intersect @xmath88 and vice versa , so there can be no further components : @xmath24 and @xmath88 each intersects @xmath38 in exactly the two waves .",
