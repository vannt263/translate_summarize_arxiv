    "the recent accurate astrophysical observations and measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) tempreture and polarization anisotropy @xcite , @xcite triggered a new interest to the theory of the two - photon processes in hydrogen in view of the important role of these processes in the cosmological hydrogen recombination . the history of the hydrogen recombination in the early universe is described in many reviews , for example @xcite .",
    "the bound - bound one - photon transitions from the upper levels to the lower ones did not permit the atoms to reach their ground states : each photon released in such a transition in one atom was immidiately absorbed by another one . in particular , the lyman - alpha radiation 2p-1s , being reabsorbed , reemitted and again reabsorbed , did not allow the radiation to escape the interaction with the matter .",
    "as it was first established in @xcite , @xcite the two - photon 2s-1s radiative transition presents one of the main channels for the radiation escape from the interaction with matter .",
    "hence , the recent properties of the cmb are essentially defined by the two - photon decay processes during the cosmological recombination epoch .    in @xcite ,",
    "@xcite it was argued that the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath2 two - photon transitions can also give a sizeable contribution to the process of the radiation escape from the interaction with the matter .",
    "recently this problem was investigated thoroughly in the theoretical astrophysical studies in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there is a crucial difference between the decay of the @xmath3 ( @xmath1 ) or @xmath4 levels and the @xmath5 decay level .",
    "this difference is due to the presence of the cascade transitions as the dominant decay channels in case of @xmath3 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath4 levels . for the @xmath5 level the cascade transitions are absent .",
    "since the cascade photons can be effectively reabsorbed , the problem of separation of the `` pure '' two - photon contribution from the cascade contribution arises .",
    "an interference between the two decay channels also should be taken into account .",
    "this problem appears to be not at all trivial and requires an application of the methods of the quantum electrodynamocs ( qed ) for the bound electrons .",
    "quantum mechanical theory for the two - photon transitions was first developed by gppert - mayer @xcite and the first evaluation of the two - photon @xmath6 decay rate in hydrogen was performed by breit and teller @xcite .",
    "the accurate nonrelativistic calculation for this transition rate was given in @xcite ; fully relativistic calculations , valid also for the h - like highly charged ions ( hci ) with arbitrary @xmath7 ( nuclear charge ) values were performed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the most accurate recent calculation for this transition rate with the qed radiative corrections taken into account belongs to jentschura @xcite . as well as for the neutral hydrogen ,",
    "the cascade problem does not arise for the transition @xmath6 in the hci with arbitrary @xmath7 values .",
    "the two - photon transitions were investigated theoretically and experimentally also in the few - electron and many - electron atoms and ions .",
    "in particular , the two - photon transition @xmath8 transition rate for the neutral he atom was first evaluated in @xcite .",
    "this decay channel also does not contain cascade contribution .",
    "the cascade problem first did arise in connection with the decay of the metastable @xmath9 level in he - like uranium : @xmath10 . in this case",
    "there are two possible cascade transitions : @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding decay rate was first evaluated by drake @xcite .",
    "later savukov and johnson @xcite performed similar calculation for a variety of he - like ions ( @xmath13 ) . in @xcite , @xcite the `` pure '' two - photon contribution was obtained by subtraction of a lorentzian fir for the cascade contribution from the total two - photon decay frequency distribution .",
    "a rigorous qed approach for the evaluation of the two - photon decay probability in presence of cascades was developed in @xcite on the basis of the line profile approach ( lpa ) in qed , i.e. the qed theory of the spectral line profile ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the lpa consists of a standard evaluation of the decay probability as a transition probability to the lower levels . in the presence of cascades",
    "the integral over emitted photon frequency distribution becomes divergent due to the singular terms , corresponding to the cascade resonances . to avoid such a singularity ,",
    "the resummation of an infinite series of the electron self - energy insertions into the electron propagator was performed in @xcite .",
    "this resummation converts into a geometric progression and in this way the electron self - energy matrix element ( and the level width as its imaginary part ) enters the energy denominator and shifts the pole from the real axis into the complex energy plane , thus making the transition probability integral finite . with this approach",
    "f. low @xcite first derived the lorentz profile from qed . in @xcite , @xcite the level widths in the energy denominators were also introduced , though as the empirical parameters . in @xcite the ambiguity of the separation of the `` pure '' two - photon decay and cascades",
    "was first revealed for hci ; it was shown also that the interference terms can essentially contribute to the total decay probability .",
    "nearly at the same time when the paper @xcite did arrive , the cascade problem was discussed also for the @xmath3 ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath4 transitions in the hydrogen atom @xcite , @xcite . in these",
    "works the `` pure '' two - photon contribution was obtained simply by omitting the resonant ( singular ) terms , responsible for the cascades .",
    "this approach was criticized later in @xcite .",
    "another ( `` alternative '' ) method which formally allows for the separate determination of the `` pure '' two - photon contribution in case of the two - photon transitions with cascades was developed in a series of works by u. jentschura @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this approach contradicts to the lpa results .",
    "the lpa was applied to the @xmath14 transition ( including cascade ) in hydrogen in @xcite , where the ambiguity of the separation of the `` pure '' two - photon and the cascade contributions was again demonstrated numerically , as in the case of the hci @xcite . very recently",
    "a paper @xcite did arrive where an attempt was made to find a compromise between lpa and `` alternative '' approach .",
    "a reasonable agreement between the numerical results obtained by both methods was found .",
    "however , to our mind , the disagreement between the lpa and `` alternative '' approach is of conceptual character and can not be eliminated .",
    "thus from the qed point of view only the total two - photon frequency distribution has a direct physical sense in case of the two - photon decays with cascades .",
    "this quantity should be a basic tool for the description of the two - photon processes in astrophysics .",
    "the employment of the `` 1 + 1 '' approximation for the description of cascades should be avoided . along this way",
    "the most recent astrophysical theories @xcite , @xcite are built .",
    "still the `` 1 + 1 '' approximation is not fully excluded from the considerations in @xcite , @xcite .    in view of the recent very accurate ( with relative accuracy @xmath15 ) measurements of the properties of cmb @xcite , @xcite and with expectation of the even more accurate ( @xmath16 ) measurements in the near future , the theory of the cosmological recombination free of any uncertainties connected with the separation of the `` pure '' two - photon and cascade contributions should be formulated .    in the present paper",
    "we will formulate such a theory for the two - photon and the multiphoton decays in hydrogen .",
    "in this theory only two types of the level decays should be present : the direct one - photon decays when they are allowed and the total two - photon decays without separation of the `` pure '' two - photon decays and cascades . the total solution of the problem formulated above consists of two steps .",
    "first , the pure qed problem of the description of the multiphoton transitions in hydrogen in the `` two - photon '' approximation should be resolved .",
    "that is , all the decays of the excited levels should be classified and described either as the direct one - photon transitions to the ground state or as the two - photon transitions with cascades . in the `` two - photon '' approximation transitions with more than two nonresonant photons should be neglected .",
    "the formulation of the `` two - photon '' approximation should finalize the first step of the studies .",
    "the present paper will concern only this first step .",
    "an important feature of the rigorous qed treatment of the process of recombination is that we have to trace the decay of every particular level up to the ground state .",
    "this is of course not the full picture of the recombination process . to be more close to the cosmological recombination one has to consider the transitions from the continuous states ( plasma electrons ) down to the ground state , taking into account the rescattering processes",
    "this would correspond to the second step mentioned above .",
    "however , the accurate treatment of the recombination process from the particular excited level , as presented in this paper , also may be of interest .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that the consequent qed treatment of the @xmath17 level decay should include the two - photon contribution comparable with the widely discussed two - photon decay of @xmath18 level @xcite-@xcite . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves only with electric dipole transitions ( both in one- and two - photon decays ) and ignore @xmath19 transitions which also are of importance ( @xcite-@xcite ) .    at the second step",
    "one should modify the basic astrophysical equations describing the level population in hydrogen in such a way that the imput data for them should be , apart from the direct one - photon transition probabilities , only the total two - photon decay rates , including cascades , without separating out the `` pure '' two - photon decay rates .",
    "the use of the `` 1 + 1 '' approximation should be fully avoided .",
    "this task is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we formulate the basic concepts for the lpa - based theory for the two - photon decay with cascades .",
    "the two - photon approximation for the description of the multiphoton transitions in hydrogen is introduced . in section iii",
    "the standard derivation of the transition rate for the lyman-@xmath20 @xmath21 transition is presented and in section iv the standard qed derivation of the lorentz profile for this emission process is given .",
    "the same is done in section v for the two - photon decay @xmath22 .",
    "the decay of the @xmath18 level is considered in section vi and the ambiguity of separation of the `` pure '' two - photon and cascade contributions is demonstrated .",
    "the decay of @xmath17 level in the two - photon approximation is described in section vii , where it is shown that this decay also contains the two - photon contribution comparable with the two - photon contribution to the decay of @xmath18-level . in section viii an investigation of the decay of @xmath23 level in the `` two - photon '' approximation is performed which gives the clue to the general formulation of the two - photon approximation in the theory of the multiphoton transitions .",
    "section ix contains discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "in this section we will follow the derivation in @xcite using this example for the formulation of the general principles of the `` two - photon approximation '' in the qed theory of the level decays .",
    "the grounds of this theory consist of few basic principles .",
    "first , all the decays should be traced up to the ground ( stable ) state . within the `` two - photon approximation ''",
    "only such transitions can be defined unambigously .",
    "the two - photon approximation assumes that we take into account either direct ( allowed ) one - photon transitions from the excited level to the ground state , or the total two - photon transitions which end up also at the ground level .",
    "the two - photon transition rates consist of the inseparably mixed `` pure '' two - photon transitions and cascades .",
    "the contribution of cascades is dominating and can be of the order of the direct one - photon transitions .",
    "the `` pure '' two - photon contributions and the corresponding interference terms between the `` pure '' two - photon contributions and cascades define the level of accuracy of our theory : two - photon approximation .",
    "thus , we neglect the `` pure '' three - photon , `` pure '' four - photon etc contributions , taking into account , however , the cascade parts of the multiphoton decays .    as the direct one - photon transitions as well as the cascade transitions we will consider only the allowed e1 transition dominant in the nonrelativistic theory .",
    "the order of magnitude of the corresponding transition rates parametrically equals to ( in relativistic units ) @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electron mass , @xmath20 is the fine structure constant , @xmath7 is the charge of nucleus and @xmath26 is the numerical coefficient . in particular , for the lyman - alpha @xmath21 transition in h - like ions @xmath27 .",
    "having in mind the astrophysical applications of our `` two - photon '' approximation we have to classify different decay channels with respect to their contribution to the radiation escape from the interaction with the matter .",
    "one of the main channels for this escape was already mentioned above : this is the two - photon decay of the @xmath5 state .",
    "the order of magnitude of the `` pure '' two - photon decay rate ( in case of @xmath5-level , when the cascade contribution is absent , the `` pure '' two - photon decay rate coincides with the total one ) is @xmath28 @xcite . in case of @xmath29 transition @xmath30 . we should stress that in the present paper we do not investigate in detail the process of the occupation of the @xmath5 state .",
    "the situations when metastable state appears as an intermediate state in the cascade processes of transitions from the upper levels , will be included in the treatment of the cascades . in particular , in our treatment in this paper the total decay rate of the @xmath17 level , apart from the one - photon decay rate @xmath31 , incorporates also the two - photon decay rate @xmath32 .",
    "this happens due to the existence of the cascade transition @xmath33",
    ". then @xmath34 ( * ) ( see section vi for details ) . in the standard treatment",
    "the transition rate of the upper link of this cascade @xmath35 contributes directly to the @xmath36 : @xmath37 ( * * ) .",
    "the difference between these two situations can be explained by the two different types of the experiment .",
    "the equality ( * * ) describes the laboratory experiment , when the photon with the frequency @xmath38 is registered .",
    "another situation occurs in the astrophysical context when it is important how fast an atom in an excited state will reach the ground level , i.e. the recombination will be accomplished . for a given cascade this depends on the slowest link of the cascade . in particular , for the @xmath17 level",
    "the slowest link of the cascade @xmath39 is the lower link : @xmath40 and the total width @xmath36 is defined by the equality ( * ) . in the other words , one has to distinguish between the lifetime of a certain level @xmath41 ( equation ( * * ) ) and the lifetime of an excited state of an atom , provided that initially this atom was in the state @xmath41 ( equation ( * ) ) .",
    "we remind that we consider here the decay processes in one single atom and ignore the possibility of reabsortion of the photon with the frequency @xmath42 by another atom .",
    "in fig . 1 the decay scheme for @xmath43 level ( lyman - alpha transition ) is depicted .",
    "the emission process in frames of qed is described by the feynman graph fig .",

    "for the more detailed analysis the contributions of the `` pure '' two - photon transition rate for the each frequency interval are also compiled .",
    "the branching ratio and the transition rate for the cascade contribution can be obtained from the relation @xmath183 .",
    "this relation is sutisfied with high accuracy since the only decay channel neglected is the very weak direct 1-photon @xmath184 transition @xmath185 . from the table 1",
    "we can draw the same conlusions : as in the case of the hci @xcite : the `` pure '' two - photon and cascade contributions to the total decay rate appear to be inseparable . changing the interval size @xmath186 , we obtain quite different values for @xmath187 ranging from @xmath188 ( for @xmath189 ) up to @xmath190 ( for @xmath191 ) .",
    "moreover , in our calculations - depending on the size of the interval - the interference contribution also can become quite large , comparable in magnitude with the `` pure '' two - photon contribution .",
    "thus , we demonstrated that even the order of magnitude of the `` pure '' two - photon decay rate for the @xmath18-state in hydrogen can not be predicted reliably .",
    "earlier the result @xmath192 @xmath193 for the `` pure '' two - photon decay of the @xmath18-level was reported in @xcite and confirmed in @xcite . however , as it was pointed out in @xcite in both papers @xcite , @xcite the summation over the intermediate states was not performed properly .",
    "the `` nonresonant '' contribution @xmath194 @xmath193 deduced in @xcite , which plays the role of the `` pure '' two - photon decay rate is well within the range of our values given table 1 .",
    "however , the result @xmath195 @xmath193 obtained for the `` pure '' two - photon decay rate in @xcite is in strong contradiction with the present analysis ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , a paper @xcite did arrive where both the standard qed approach , based on the line profile theory ( @xcite-@xcite ) and the `` alternative '' approach based on the two - loop lamb shift theory ( @xcite-@xcite ) were applied to the calculation of the two - photon transition in hydrogen .",
    "a reasonable agreement between the two methods was found .",
    "however , from the derivations in @xcite it follows that the employment of the lamb shift imaginary part gives exactly the same results as the lpa qed approach .    in the end of this section",
    "we will explain why the contributions of the `` pure '' two - photon transition rates in table 1 are of the same order as the interference terms . as it was mentioned earlier",
    "the contribution of the cascade is of the order @xmath196 in r.u . however ,",
    "this is the result of the integration over the frequency interval of the order @xmath197 .",
    "then the order of the magnitude of the `` amplitude '' in the integrand is 1 ( and dimensionless ) .",
    "the order of the magnitude of the `` pure '' two - photon contribution is @xmath198 r.u .",
    "this result also incorporates the integral over frequency interval of the order @xmath199 in r.u .",
    "then the order of the magnitude of the corresponding `` amplitude '' in the integrand is @xmath200^{1/2}=\\alpha ( \\alpha z)^2 $ ] .",
    "the latter value is again dimensionless . multiplying the cascade and `` pure '' two - photon `` amplitudes '' in the integrand",
    "we will have the dimensionless integrand of the order @xmath201 . finally ,",
    "integrating the product over the frequency interval @xmath202 , where the interference terms are nonzero , we obtain the contribution of the order @xmath203 r.u .",
    "this is parametrically the same as the order of magnitude for the `` pure '' two - photon contribution .",
    "the @xmath204 decay can occur either as one - photon or as three - photon process .",
    "these channels do not interfere due to the different number of photons in the final state .",
    "the one - photon decay @xmath205 corresponds to the decay scheme fig .",
    "1 , where the initial state @xmath43 should be replaced by @xmath17 .",
    "the value @xmath31 can be obtained from the formula ( 11 ) when inserting there @xmath206 , @xmath134 .",
    "the result is @xmath207    the schematic picture for the process @xmath208 is given in fig .",
    "10 and the corresponding feynman graph is depicted in fig . 11 . the three - photon emission probability was evaluated in our work @xcite for the @xmath21 three - photon transition in hydrogen .",
    "the parametric estimate can be easily found and is equal to @xmath209 in relativistic units .",
    "the value of the probability for this transition is @xmath210 r.u .",
    "the @xmath211 transition is `` pure '' 3-photon transition ( no cascade are possible in this case)and , according to our general scheme ( see section ii ) should be neglected . for @xmath212 transition",
    "the two cascades should be taken into account : @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "the contribution of these two cascades will be studied in this section .",
    "it will be shown that the decay rates of these two cascade channels will be comparable with the `` pure '' two - photon contribution of the @xmath215 channel . unlike the @xmath215 case , where the contribution of the `` pure '' two - photon decay is nonseparable from the cascade contribution , for @xmath212 decay only the cascade contribution should be taken into account .",
    "the reason is that the `` pure '' 3-photon contribution is beyond the accuracy of the `` two - photon '' approximation , adopted in this paper .",
    "the @xmath44-matrix element for the 3-photon decay process @xmath216 is : @xmath217 where the photon field @xmath218 is described by eq .",
