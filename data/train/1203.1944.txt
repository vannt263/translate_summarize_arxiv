    "long - term source behaviour of the source in the gev band is puzzling .",
    "orbital modulation was clearly observable at the beginning of fermi observations at the superorbital phase @xmath33 .",
    "the phase of the maximum orbital modulation of the gev flux in this superorbital phase range was close to the phase of the x - ray activity .",
    "however , in the time period following the superorbital phase @xmath34 a clear orbital modulation pattern disappeared",
    "( see also @xcite ) . further study of the source on the time scale of several superorbital cycles is needed to clarify the repeatability of the observed appearance / disappearance of the orbital modulation pattern and its relation to the overall 4.6  yr activity cycle of the source .",
    "a constant time delay between the drifting orbital phases of x - ray and radio flares could be naturally explained if one takes into account that radio and x - ray emission originate from different regions .",
    "the radio emission is produced at large distance from the binary , @xmath35  cm @xcite while the x - ray flux is most probably produced at shorter distances of the order of the binary separation @xmath36 .",
    "assuming that injection of high - energy electrons responsible for the x - ray and radio flares happens in the same event in the binary , one could attribute the time delay between the x - ray and radio flares to the time - of - flight of the high - energy particle filled plasma to the radio emission region .",
    "the cooling times of high energy particles are long enough to allow them to travel to the radio emission region .",
    "this gives an estimate of the plasma outflow velocity @xmath37  cm / s , which is in good agreement with the asymptotic velocity of the stellar wind from the massive star in both the polar and equatorial regions @xcite .",
    "the constant time delay between the x - ray and radio flare phases suggests the following scenario of production of the periodic radio flares .",
    "once per orbit , an event of interaction of the compact object with the stellar wind leads to injection of high - energy particles into the stellar wind .",
    "the high - energy particles mixed into the stellar wind escape from the binary system with the stellar wind velocity .",
    "a radio flare occurs at the moment when the portion of the stellar wind filled with high - energy electrons reaches the distances @xmath38 at which the system becomes transparent to the radio waves .",
    "high - energy electrons , responsible for the radio - to - x - ray emission , are held in the plasma outflow by the magnetic field .",
    "electrons producing synchrotron emission in the radio band have energies @xmath39^{-1/2}\\left[\\nu_r/10\\mbox { ghz } \\right]^{1/2}$ ]  mev , where @xmath40 is the frequency of the radio synchrotron emission .",
    "the main cooling mechanisms for such electrons are synchrotron and/or inverse compton emission with the characteristic cooling time scales @xmath41^{-3/2}\\left[\\nu_r/10\\mbox { ghz}\\right]^{-1/2}$ ]  yr and @xmath42^{-2}\\mbox { d}$ ] .",
    "unless magnetic field in the system is much higher than @xmath43  g , the synchrotron and inverse compton cooling time scales are not shorter than the time - of - flight from inside the binary orbit to the radio emission region .",
    "thus energy losses do not prevent electrons injected in the binary system from traveling to the radio emission region on a time scale of several days .",
    "the x - ray emission is most probably produced via the synchrotron mechanism by electrons of the energies @xmath44^{-1/2}\\left[e_x/5.4\\mbox { kev}\\right]^{1/2}\\mbox { gev}$ ] .",
    "this conjecture is supported by the observations of fast variability of x - ray emission on the time scales @xmath45  s @xcite which is comparable to the synchrotron cooling time of 100  gev electrons in the @xmath43  g magnetic field .",
    "the absence of any obvious break / cut - off features in the kev - gev source spectrum with a maximum in the @xmath46  mev range is in favour of interpretation of the entire kev - gev bump as a single spectral component .",
    "in such a model the gev band emission is due to the synchrotron emission by the 10 - 100  tev electrons .",
    "the phase of the  flare is close to the phase of the x - ray flare ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pca ] and [ fig : fermi ] ) , at least during a part of the superorbital cycle @xmath33 .",
    "it is natural to identify the phase of the x - ray/  flare with the moment of formation of high - energy particle outflow inside the binary .",
    "long term evolution of this phase could not be followed in the  band , because of the large width of the activity period after the superorbital phase @xmath47 . in the x - ray band",
    "the width remains finite all over the superorbital cycle .",
    "difference in the superorbital modulation pattern in x - rays and s is , most probably , related to different regimes of acceleration / propagation / cooling of 10 mev and 10 tev electrons .",
    "the phase of the x - ray activity is close to the phase of the periastron of the binary orbit @xmath48 at the superorbital phase @xmath49 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pca ] ) when the duration of the activity period is shortest .",
    "the phase of activity gradually shifts to the post - periastron interval @xmath50 over the superorbital period and almost reaches the phase of the apastron @xmath51 toward the end of the superorbital cycle so that the x - ray emission is always delayed with respect to the apastron .",
    "shift of @xmath22 is accompanied by the increase of the width of activity period .",
    "a possible explanation for such behaviour could be found in a scenario in which the 4.6  yr superorbital cycle is interpreted as the cycle of gradual buildup and decay of the equatorial disk of the be star . at @xmath49",
    "the equatorial disk is weak .",
    "the phase of the closest encounter between the disk and the compact object is the phase of the periastron .",
    "interaction of the compact object with the disk perturbs the disk and strips away a part of the disk which escapes from the system to the radio emission region .",
    "gradual buildup of the equatorial disk due to ejection of matter from the be star leads to the increase of the disk density and/or disk size .",
    "such a scenario implies that extended radio emission should nt have a clear jet - like morphology , but rather have an irregular morphology varying over the orbital and superorbital cycle.such a variable morphologu is indeed observed in the radio band @xcite .",
    "the shift of the phase @xmath22 of ejection of a portion of the disk could be explained by the increase of the time of accumulation of energy sufficient for ejection .",
    "the kinetic energy needed to strip away a part of the disk is comparable to the gravitational binding energy of the disk , @xmath52\\left[r_d/10^{12}\\mbox { cm}\\right]\\left[h_d/10^{12}\\mbox { cm}\\right]\\times$ ] @xmath53 $ ]  erg , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the density , radius and thickness of the equatorial disk .",
    "such energy should be transmitted to the disk by the compact object at each disk - compact object interaction event .",
    "suppose that the compact object injects energy in the disk at a constant rate @xmath56  erg / s at each interaction event .",
    "the energy sufficient for ejection of a part of the disk is then accumulated on a time scale @xmath57^{-1}$ ]  d. accumulation of mass in the disk leads to the increase of @xmath58 and , as a consequence , to the shift of @xmath22 .",
    "if the disk size reaches the size of the binary orbit , the compact object always moves inside the disk and continuously perturbs it .",
    "studies of the high - mass x - ray binaries with be stars show that in this case the compact object induced instabilities in the disk might lead to destruction and complete loss of the disk .",
    "our hypothesis is that the loss of the disk corresponds to the period in the superorbital phase range @xmath59 when the strength of x - ray and radio flares decreases and no systematic periodic variability of the source is observed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pca ] , [ fig : radio ] and @xcite ) .",
    "ejection of matter from the equatorial regions of be star leads to formation of a new disk at around @xmath49 and a new cycle of disk growth / decay starts .",
    "in such a scenario , regularity of the superorbital modulation in the system could be readily explained",
    ". the constant growth rate of the equatorial disk of be star is determined by the stable rotation of the be star .",
    "the period of superorbital modulation is determined by the fixed time scale on which the disk growth to the size comparable to the size of the binary orbit .",
    "this scenario for the origin of the orbital and superorbital modulations of the source flux could be tested using the h@xmath60 data which provide a diagnostic of the state of the equatorial disk of be star @xcite .",
    "growth and decay cycles of the disk lead to the variations of the overall strength and shape of the h@xmath60 line .",
    "variability of the line intensity and profile on the time scale of the superorbital modulation was demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "monitoring of the h@xmath60 line on the time scale of several superorbital cycles would show if the the observed variability corresponds to the periodic buildup and decay of the disk .",
    "periodic ejection of a part of the disk as a result of the compact object - disk interaction might be responsible for occurence of transient red or blue `` shoulders '' of h@xmath60 line as observed by @xcite .",
    "systematic re - observation of the repetition of occurence of the shoulders in many orbital cycles and correlation of the phase of occurence of the shoulders with the phases of x - ray flares would provide a direct test for our model .",
