    "particularly , in this paper we present the dynamics of a wave packet obtained from the solution of the dirac equation with a vector potential created by two infinite solenoids .",
    "the vector potential of a single infinite solenoid oriented along the y - axis can be written as    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the magnetic flux inside the solenoid , @xmath58 defines the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath59 is the radius of the solenoid , and @xmath60 is the distance from the center of the solenoid in the x - z plane .",
    "outside two parallel infinite solenoids separated by a distance @xmath44 and with opposite magnetic field orientation , the vector potential is then    @xmath61    an example of the shape of this potential is shown in figure [ fig : plot_of_vector_potential ] . outside the solenoids , the associated magnetic fields @xmath62 of the vector potentials described by eqs .",
    "( [ vect_pot_inf_solenoid ] ) and ( [ vect_pot_two_inf_solenoid ] ) are zero .",
    "the time - dependent dirac equation is now solved for the scalar component of the four - potential @xmath63 and the vector component @xmath64 defined by eq .",
    "( [ vect_pot_two_inf_solenoid ] ) . with this choice we can study the dynamics of the wave packet in the region where the electric and the magnetic fields of the unperturbed solenoids are zero .",
    "the dynamics of the electron motion between two infinite and parallel solenoids is essentially the same as the electron dynamics in the case of aharonov - bohm effect . in both cases the electron moves in a region where the unperturbed solenoids produce no lorentz force on the electron . because of the symmetry",
    ", however , the dynamics in the case of two infinite solenoids consists only of the motion along one straight line between the solenoids .",
    "this avoids the complications of the aharonov - bohm dynamics where the trajectories on opposite sides of a single solenoid are compared . because the properties of the dynamics are not studied through an interference , in the case of two solenoids the changes in the dynamics of the electron wave packet exclude the contribution of the nonlocal properties of the electron wave function dependent on the topology of the space .",
    "another advantage of using two solenoids and localized wave packet is the possibility to separate the solenoids far enough that no parts of the wave packet penetrate the non - zero field region inside the solenoids , excluding this contribution to the dynamics as well .",
    "if necessary , the solenoids could be shielded by a potential barrier of a supercritical potential additionally preventing any penetration of the wave packet into non - zero field region .",
    "the motion of the wave packet between the solenoids , in the plane normal to the orientation of the solenoids , is shown in figure [ fig : wave_two_solenoids ] .",
    "the wave packet was initially positioned away from center of the solenoids .",
    "the dynamics was studied for two initial momenta , @xmath37 or @xmath65 .",
    "the solenoids were separated by a distance of @xmath66 and the magnitude of the magnetic flux inside each of them was @xmath67 .    as shown in figure [ fig : wave_two_solenoids ] , and in the related animation , the wave packet moved between two solenoids along a straight line , dispersing in time in the direction normal to the direction of motion .",
    "since for the unperturbed solenoid , there was no classical force acting on the electron , one should have expected a constant velocity of the wave packet along the straight line .",
    "this was not the case .",
    "the velocity of the wave packet , shown in figure [ fig : two_solenoids_velocity ] as a function of the position , increased as the packet approached the solenoids and decreased as the packet left the solenoids .",
    "it is somewhat paradoxical that while there was no classical force expected to act on the electron , the electron acceleration , obtained strictly as a solution of the dirac equation , was not zero .    extensive studies and verifications of this result were performed .",
    "they include the dependence of the solution of the dirac equation on particle charge , energy , spin orientation , orientation of the solenoids , and the strength and the orientation of the magnetic field inside the solenoid .",
    "in addition , the time and the position dependencies of the particle momentum , energy and canonical momentum were computed . the results could be summarized as follows :    * the change of the velocity of the wave packet did not depend on the particle spin orientation relative to the orientation of the solenoids * as shown in figure [ fig : positron_electron_velocities ] , change of the sign of a charged particle inverted the order of the change of the velocity , but the velocities converged to the same value at spatial infinity * change of the orientation of the magnetic field inside the solenoids had the same effect as change of the sign of charged particles * as also shown in figure [ fig : positron_electron_velocities ] , the mechanical momentum of the particle changed during the process , but the total energy and the canonical momentum did not change",
    "the change of velocity was predicted more than 35 years ago by liebowitz @xcite and by boyer @xcite , and was proposed as the basis for the aharonov - bohm phase shift .",
    "it was shown that if the magnetic interaction energy of the unperturbed solenoid currents and the passing charge is assigned to a kinetic energy change of the passing electron , then the electron has the same qualitative velocity change as found from our numerical calculation of a wave packet dynamics in the dirac equation .",
    "through lowest order in the particle - solenoid interaction , the energy conservation criterion used by boyer is equivalent to conservation of the passing charge s canonical momentum @xmath68 .",
    "thus @xmath69 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\vec p c^{2}}{% ( p^{2}c^{2}+m^{2}c^{4})^{1/2}}\\cdot \\frac{d\\vec p}{dt}+q\\vec v \\cdot ( \\vec v \\cdot \\vec \\nabla ) \\vec a \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\vec v \\cdot \\frac{d ( \\vec p + q\\vec a)}{dt}=\\vec v \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec p_{c}}{dt } \\label{boyer_no_force}\\end{aligned}\\]]where the term @xmath70 was neglected as higher order in the interaction .",
    "this equation implies conservation of the canonical momentum of the particle . in classical dynamics , the motion of an electron can now be obtained by solving the differential equation @xmath71 since @xmath72 does not explicitly depend on time , for the motion along the x - axis , eq .",
    "( [ general_no_force ] ) can be written as @xmath73 in the relativistic case @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the rest mass of the electron .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ general_no_force ] ) and ( [ rel_momentum ] ) we get the differential equation for the velocity of the electron @xmath76 substituting @xmath72 from the eq .",
    "( [ vect_pot_two_inf_solenoid ] ) for @xmath48 , electron motion along the mid - path between two solenoids , the differential equation for the velocity of the electron becomes @xmath77 where @xmath78 is half the distance between two parallel infinite solenoids .",
    "this differential equation can be solved numerically .",
    "figure [ fig : theory_two_solenoids_velocity ] shows the qualitative agreement of the classical dynamics of the particle obtained from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ rel_diff_eq_final ] ) and the quantum dynamics of the corresponding wave packet obtained from the solution of the dirac equation .",
    "to conclude this section , we can look at the ongoing question if the aharonov - bohm effect is the result of a force changing the velocity of a particle passing on opposite sides of a single infinitely long solenoid , or there is only a quantum - mechanical phase shift @xcite .",
    "quantum - mechanically such a question does not exist .",
    "the dynamics of the relativistic electron should be obtained only as a solution of the time - dependent dirac equation .",
    "the solution of the dirac equation shows that the velocity of a wave packet changes even in the region where the unperturbed solenoid gives zero magnetic field .",
    "since the change of the velocity depends on the gradient of the vector potential , the velocity of the wave packet passing on the opposite sides of the solenoid will be different .",
    "however , the particle exits the near - solenoid region with the same energy as when it entered , regardless of the side on which it passed the solenoid .    from the studies presented in this paper , the classical picture of the aharonov - bohm effect consists of the phase shift in the wave function of the particles passing on opposite sides of a solenoid being attributed to time lag resulting from different evolution of the velocities of the particles . a phase shift",
    "then results in an interference pattern change .",
    "in conclusion , the full three - dimensional finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) method was developed to solve the dirac equation . in this paper , the method was applied to the dynamics of the electron wave packet in a vector potential in an arrangement associated with the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the solution of the dirac equation showed that the velocity of the electron wave packet changed even in the region where the electric and the magnetic fields were zero .",
    "the solution of the dirac equation qualitatively agreed with the prediction of classical dynamics under the assumption that the dynamics were defined by the conservation of generalized or canonical momentum .",
    "the studies in this paper help establishing a picture of the aharonov - bohm effect as the interference pattern resulting from the phase shift in the wave function of the particles passing on opposite sides of a solenoid attributed to a time lag resulting from different evolution of the velocities of the particles .",
