    "electromagnetic ( em ) productions of the hadrons off the nucleon target have been very useful tools to study the nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in terms of the color - singlet degrees of freedom at a scale @xmath9 gev from the experimental and theoretical points of view . from those production processes",
    ", one can extract the fundamental information for the em and strong interaction structures , the hadron mass spectra , and missing resonances searches for instance .",
    "note that the em production of hadrons have been studied energetically by the various experimental collaborations : lamp2 at daresbury  @xcite , clas at jefferson laboratory  @xcite , lesp at spring-8  @xcite , cb - elsa / taps at bonn  @xcite , and so on .",
    "along with those experimental endeavors , there have been abundant theoretical works for them as well , such as the photoproduction of @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath11  @xcite , @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13  @xcite , @xmath14  @xcite , and @xmath15  @xcite , employing the tree - level born approximation with the effective lagrangian approach , and accumulated considerably important results .    among those theoretical efforts ,",
    "it is worth mentioning the interesting results of our previous works on the @xmath16 photoproduction  @xcite . in terms of the gauge invariance of the scattering amplitude , i.e. the ward - takahashi ( wt ) identity , it turned out that the contact - term contribution prevails over all other kinematic channels .",
    "this interesting behavior of the _ contact - term dominance _ can be also resulted in the large target asymmetry , saying that the production rate from the proton target is much larger than that for the neutron - target case , in which the contact - term contribution does not exists due to the electric - charge conservation : @xmath17 . in 2009 ,",
    "the leps collaboration reported that the differential cross sections for the @xmath8 photoproduction off the proton as well as the deuteron targets .",
    "interestingly enough , the production rates turned out to be similar to each other : @xmath18 . here , @xmath19 denotes the angle for the outgoing @xmath20 with respect to the incident photon in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system .",
    "thus , this observation indicates that the contact - term dominance works qualitatively well , if we take into account a naive but reasonable assumption @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "note that there are theoretical supports for the contact - term dominance for @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the resonance contributions for the @xmath8 production is also important to be studied . from the photoproduction experiment by the leps collaboration  @xcite , it was observed that the peak of the differential cross section as a function of @xmath23 varies its strength depending on the @xmath19 angle . this tendency may indicate a possible contribution from a nucleon resonance . then , the two theoretical works , employing the effective approaches , suggested that the @xmath2 resonance , which is now split into two different resonant states @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xcite , can be the most possible candidate for it  @xcite .",
    "we also want to focus on the distinctive features between the electro and photoproductions of @xmath8 . in the clas experiment for the @xmath8 electroproduction",
    "@xcite , the @xmath5 decay - angle ( @xmath6 ) distribution in the gottfried - jackson ( gj ) frame was described mainly by a curve @xmath26 , signaling that @xmath27 decays into @xmath28 mainly , in addition to small contributions from the other spin states . here ,",
    "@xmath29 stand for that @xmath8 in its spin-@xmath30 states , and @xmath6 indicates the angle between the target nucleon and outgoing @xmath5 in the @xmath8 rest frame .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath6 distribution for the @xmath8 photoproduction shows the curve @xmath31 , in which @xmath32 decays into @xmath28  @xcite . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , the @xmath6 distribution for the photoproduction was reproduced qualitatively well in terms of the contact - term dominance .",
    "this result also indicates that the contact - term contribution plays the role of the spin-@xmath33 meson exchange in addition to the @xmath34 exchange in the @xmath4 channel . in general , the most obvious difference in these two em productions",
    "is that the existence of the longitudinal - polarization component of the virtual photon .",
    "physically , the difference shown in the @xmath6 distribution between the em productions can be understood by the @xmath35 ( longitudinal ) component of the polarization vector selects the spin-@xmath36 meson , i.e. kaon exchange in the @xmath4 channel .",
    "hence , in the electroproduction , the possibility for @xmath27 gets enhanced than that for @xmath32 , resulting in that the curve shape for the @xmath6 distribution becomes proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "focusing on the two intriguing ingredients mentioned above , 1 ) the nucleon - resonance contributions and 2 ) the distinctive features in the electroproduction in comparison to the photoproduction , in the present work , we want to investigate the elementary process for the electroproduction of @xmath16 off the nucleon target , i.e. @xmath37 . so far , we have had only one @xmath8-electroproduction experiment done by barrow _",
    "_ of the clas collaboration  @xcite .",
    "hence , we will closely explore those data theoretically in the present work .",
    "to this end , we make use of the effective lagrangian approach at the tree - level born approximation , closely following the theoretical framework in our previous works  @xcite .",
    "note that this very simple theoretical framework violates unitarity explicitly .",
    "this unitarity problem can be cured by considering intermediate scattering processes with the mesons and baryons , such as the @xmath38-matrix method  @xcite .",
    "a typical calculation using the @xmath38-matrix method for the @xmath39 channel was done for the @xmath6 photoproduction , taking into account the intermediate @xmath40 state in addition to the ground states , in ref .",
    "it turned out that the effects of the @xmath38-matrix unitarization is small , and the pomeron - exchange dominates both of the @xmath38-matrix and tree - level results .",
    "hence , considering the similarity within this kind of calculations , we would like to keep employing the tree - level calculation for the @xmath8 em production processes , avoiding complexities in the calculations .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors explored several effective unitarization methods within the effective lagrangian approach , although the inclusion of the unitarity into the tree - level approximation is still imperfect in terms of the gauge invariance , relativity , and so on .",
    "the rarita - schwinger vector - spinor formalism is used for describing the spin-@xmath41 field for @xmath8 in a field theoretical manner  @xcite .",
    "we also take into account the phenomenological form factors for each kinematic channels , following the prescription suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , with a newly devised gauge - conserving term similar to that given in ref .",
    "@xcite . to take into account the @xmath42 dependence of the form factors , we employ the dipole and monopole em form factors for the vertices , where the hadrons couple to the virtual photon .",
    "all the numerical calculations are performed in the @xmath38-@xmath8 cm system with the properly defined four momenta and polarization vectors for the relevant particles involved .",
    "the transverse polarization parameter @xmath43 is chosen to be @xmath44 throughout the theoretical calculations , considering the experimentally given value @xmath45",
    "in addition , taking into account the clas experiment , we choose the kinematic regions for the photon virtuality and @xmath38-@xmath8 cm energy as @xmath46 and @xmath47 gev , respectively . in the present work , as a first step to investigate the nucleon - resonance effects for the scattering process",
    ", we take into account @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , since these resonances were found to be relevant in the @xmath8 photoproduction  @xcite . in order to study the @xmath6 distribution ,",
    "we devise a simple parameterization for it , by separating the differential cross section into each @xmath8 spin states theoretically  @xcite .",
    "firstly , as for the theoretical results , we provide the total and differential cross sections , @xmath8 spin distribution , @xmath6 distribution , and @xmath4-momentum transfer distribution for the proton target case .",
    "it turns out that the present theoretical framework reproduces the data qualitatively well with the resonance contributions , which play a crucial role in the vicinity of @xmath48 gev . at the same time",
    ", it turns out that the @xmath7 resonance enhances the production rate in the forward - scattering region .",
    "we also show numerically that the longitudinal - polarization of the virtual photon enhances the kaon - exchange contribution more as expected , than its effects on the contact - term one .",
    "this enhancement is also shown explicitly by that the numerical results for the @xmath6 distribution turns out to be considerably different from that for the photoproduction .",
    "secondly , we apply the determined information for the resonances from the electroproduction to the photoproduction of @xmath8 to see their effects . by doing that",
    ", we observe that the resonance contributions are not so effective in comparison to that for the electroproduction , since the contact - term contribution dominates the photoproduction process even with the resonance . finally , using all the ingredients obtained above , we compute",
    "the total and differential cross sections for the @xmath8 electroproduction off the neutron target . on top of the negligible @xmath34-exchange contribution",
    ", the production rate of the cross sections are saturated almost by the @xmath7 and @xmath49 contributions . from this",
    ", we can conclude that the @xmath8 em productions off the neutron target are utmost useful production channels to investigate the nucleon - resonance contributions , since the production rate is dominated almost only by them , due to the absence of the _ contact - term _ contribution .",
    "moreover , we make some brief comments on the contact - term dominance in the @xmath8 em productions , considering all the observations mentioned above .",
    "the present work is organized as follows : in section ii , we briefly introduce the present theoretical framework , defining the effective interactions for the relevant yukawa vertices , computing coupling strengths , writing down the invariant amplitudes , and so on .",
    "the numerical results and related discussions are given in section iii .",

    ", we provide approximated amplitudes for the resonance contributions as an _ example_.",
    "it can be easily verified that , at very low - energy region , the invariant amplitudes for the @xmath7 and @xmath49 contributions can be written by changing the projection operators with the metric tensors .",

    "<S> we investigate the unpolarized electroproduction of @xmath0 off the nucleon target , using the effective lagrangian method at the tree - level born approximation with the nucleon - resonance contributions from @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> it turns out that @xmath7 plays an important role to reproduce the electroproduction data properly . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results for the @xmath6 distribution shows obvious different structures from that for the photoproduction , due to the enhancement of the kaon exchange by the longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon as expected . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , we observe that the kaon - exchange contribution in the @xmath4 channel becomes about a half of that from the contact - term one that dominates the photoproduction of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide theoretical estimations for the @xmath8 electroproduction off the neutron target , showing that its production rate is saturated almost by the resonance contributions . </S>",
