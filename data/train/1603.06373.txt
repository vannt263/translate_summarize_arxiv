    "through its influence on the diffusion of spin - bearing particles , the physical characteristics of the medium leaves its signature on the observed nmr signal .",
    "this makes nmr a powerful probe into the microstructure of biological specimens as well as other porous media .",
    "nmr s sensitivity to diffusional processes can be controlled by introducing gradient waveforms into standard nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "the effect of free diffusion on experiments with general gradient waveforms has been fully characterized @xcite .",
    "however , the complexity of the environment typically leads to non - gaussian motion , which yields interesting features in the nmr signal decay that depend on the local structure .",
    "for example , a time - dependence in the diffusion coefficients @xcite tend to emerge in complex environments , while the large wavenumber regime of the signal decay could exhibit unique features @xcite as well .",
    "time dependence in diffusion coefficients was investigated extensively with emphasis on and ageing @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied as a possible indicator of mesoscopic disorder in materials and tissues , making use of diffusion - sensitive nmr images @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review on diffusion in tissues ) .",
    "fractional brownian motion is yet another viable model in which to view the signatures of non - gaussian motion in nmr signals , which is amenable to path integral methods @xcite similar in that regard to the approach discussed in the present article . in this paper",
    ", we consider the case of diffusion taking place under the influence of a hookean force field .",
    "this problem is well - studied in the field of stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , the first occurrence of it in the nmr literature is in a couple of papers published in 1960s @xcite , wherein the authors consider the case of `` diffusion near an attractive center '' and derive the signal expression for their then recent pulsed field gradient framework @xcite .",
    "since then callaghan and pinder used the formalism on a semi - dilute solution of an entangled polystyrene to model the displacements of the resulting network , which is stable during the timescale of the nmr measurement @xcite .",
    "le doussal and sen employed the problem as an `` artificial pore '' model to understand the effects of restricted diffusion in the presence of nonlinear magnetic field gradients @xcite . mitra and",
    "halperin also touched upon the problem , referring to it as the `` parabolic pore '' in the context of the center - of - mass propagators @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we have two main goals : ( i ) to provide an analytical framework with which one can derive explicit relationships for the signal decay for a general time - dependent gradient waveform , and ( ii ) develop semi - analytical and numerical tools , which could be generalized with relative ease to complicated potentials . as demonstrated below , our formulation naturally leads to a new characterization of diffusion anisotropy ; similar in spirit to the diffusion tensor model @xcite .",
    "however , while the latter tries to fit imaging data to a free diffusion model despite the underlying non - free diffusion , the present framework allows taking confinement into account , which is modeled as a harmonic force .",
    "the advantage of taking confinement into account is found in the time dependence of the predicted signal profile , which exhibits features more similar to that of actual restricted diffusion . employing a harmonic confinement instead of a direct implementation of restricted diffusion , on the other hand",
    ", offers a degree of tractability that encodes full anisotropy easily .",
    "for instance , compared to a restricted diffusion model involving a capped cylinder @xcite , which has _ two _ length parameters due to its partial isotropy , the confinement tensor generally has three distinct size parameters ( related to its eigenvalues ) that can capture full three - dimensional anisotropy , much like the diffusion tensor model .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in the next section , sec .",
    "[ sec : pathint ] , we express the nmr signal as a path integral and evaluate it assuming a hookean potential as stated above , providing a general expression that can be used with arbitrary gradient sequences . as such , we end the section by deriving analytical expressions for the expected nmr signal for the conventional pulsed field gradient ( stejskal - tanner ) and oscillating gradient sequences . for the sake of keeping the main text to the point , technicalities involved in evaluating the path integral are discussed in great detail in appendix [ app : pathint ] . in the subsequent section , sec .",
    "[ sec : mcf ] , we introduce the formulation of the semi - analytical multiple correlation function framework ( mcf ) @xcite , assuming a general confining potential .",
    "its application to the special case of a hookean potential is presented in appendix [ app : mcf ] , along with relevant technical details . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] , the random walk simulations are described before proceeding with the validation of the ( semi-)analytical approaches and the deliberation of the hookean model as an alternative tool for the characterization of diffusion anisotropy in the results section , followed by concluding remarks .",
    "here , we derive an analytical expression via a path integral for the average transverse magnetization in a specimen , stemming from spin - bearing random walkers subject to a hookean potential . in order to isolate details of the derivation from the results ,",
    "we have placed most of the former in appendix [ app : pathint ] while restricting to the essential points in this section .    in a medium subjected to a ( spatially ) non - uniform magnetic field , a diffusing spin - carrier experiences a rate of ( larmor ) precession that varies with respect to its spatial position . compared to a steady precession in the case of a uniform magnetic field",
    ", therefore , each particle picks up a phase in its rotation , depending on its random path .",
    "hence , from an ensemble of such random walkers in a ( time - dependent ) spatially linear magnetic field gradient @xmath0 of duration @xmath1 , an average signal of @xmath2 is obtained , which is the average transverse magnetization up to a unit . here , since the average is to be taken over all random paths @xmath3 , the expectation value has the form of a path integral , @xmath4 \\ , { { \\mathrm e}}^{- { { \\mathrm i}}\\gamma \\int_0^{{{t_\\mathrm{f } } } } { { \\mathrm d}}t \\ , \\bm{g } ( t ) \\cdot { \\bm{r}}(t ) } \\ ; , \\label{eq : path.int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 denotes an integral over the space of paths , and @xmath6 $ ] the weight of the path @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath7 is a normalized quantity that takes the value of 1 when @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the probability weight @xmath6 $ ] is most easily imagined as an infinite product of stepwise probabilities of transition from each intermediate path point to the next .    in this article",
    ", we assume that the stochastic process underlying the random paths is diffusion with diffusivity @xmath10 under the effect of a _ dimensionless _",
    "hookean potential , @xmath11 where we refer to @xmath12 , having dimension of inverse length squared , as the _ confinement tensor_. the true tensorial force constant can be obtained by multiplying @xmath13 by the boltzmann constant @xmath14 and the absolute temperature @xmath15 .",
    "we argue that the potential defined above suffices to capture relevant features of diffusion in confined spaces .",
    "the advantage of the assumption is that the stepwise probabilities mentioned above have a simple form ( see appendix [ app : pathint ] ) and the resulting path weight is analytically tractable .",
    "we find that the nmr signal , or average transverse magnetization , that ensues the application of an arbitrary gradient waveform @xmath0 is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a matrix of rate constants ( inverse time ) , simply proportional to the confinement tensor @xmath12 .",
    "the inverse of this matrix encodes the time scales involved in equilibration , namely the approach of a distribution of diffusing particles toward the boltzmann distribution @xmath19 .",
    "essentially , it is the finite width of this final gaussian profile that is regarded as a measure of confinement in the present article , by matching it to the width of an actual confined geometry ( appendix [ sec : analytical1d ] ) .          the results derived above can be employed to obtain exact expressions for the nmr signal intensity for any gradient waveform . in this section",

    ", diffusion is governed by the smoluchowski equation @xcite , while the transverse magnetization carried by the random walkers need also be taken into account .",

    "the first step toward the evaluation of eq .",

    "conversely , at a fixed number of realizations , higher frequency simulations ( with higher signal values ) have better sampling and hence better likelihood of small error .          incorporating a tensorial force constant ( while keeping the diffusivity a scalar ) leads to a characterization of anisotropy alternative to the commonly employed diffusion tensor model . here , we shall focus on the explicit results for the stejskal - tanner sequence , i.e. , eqs .   and .",

    "the diffusivity and temperature were as before while the confinement tensor was taken to be diagonal with eigenvalues chosen such that @xmath98 corresponded to a pore size of approximately @xmath99 m while @xmath100 was taken to be one - tenth of @xmath101 so that the corresponding pore size along the @xmath102 axis was roughly @xmath103 m .",
    "we chose the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor through the expression @xmath104 which was obtained by setting the mean squared displacements , @xmath105 , implied by the two models equal to each other ( see eq . ) .",
    "different colors in figure [ fig : stejskaltanner_anisotropy ] represent different values for the angle between the gradient direction and the `` fiber , '' i.e. , the @xmath102-axis .    in the first panel of figure [ fig : stejskaltanner_anisotropy ] , we plot the predicted nmr signal against @xmath106 .",
    "the timing parameters were : @xmath107ms and @xmath108ms .",
    "as expected , the @xmath106 dependence of the signal appears linear for both models on a semi - logarithmic plot .",
    "the two models yield essentially the same results ; the slight deviation is due to the pulse duration .",
    "the difference of the models becomes apparent when one considers the dependence of the signal on the timing parameters of the sequence . to illustrate this",

    ", the @xmath109 values were fixed to @xmath110rad / mm and the pulse separation was again @xmath107ms . in this case , the diffusion tensor model implies a linear appearance in the semi - logarithmic plots",
    ". however , the dependence in the confinement tensor model is more complicated with non - linearity becoming quite substantial in the most restricted directions .",
    "parabolic potentials are useful in numerous physics problems when one is interested in modeling slight deviations away from the equilibrium state ; when the perturbation is small , any potential can be approximated by a quadratic function . in this study , however , the utility of employing a parabolic potential model was due to a different reason .",
    "following previous work @xcite , our development can be regarded to yield an alternative model of restricted diffusion , which was the main motivation of this study .",
    "its resemblance to restricted diffusion is due to the time - dependence of the underlying mean square displacements ( hence the diffusion coefficients ) .",
    "the mean square displacement implied by the propagator in is @xmath111 , which approaches a plateau as @xmath112 as expected in restricted geometries .    despite this resemblance ,",
    "the signal implied by the parabolic potential model has an important difference from that for restricted diffusion models .",
    "the phases of the random walkers turn out to be gaussian - distributed @xcite .",
    "thus , the logarithm of the predicted signal for each isolated pore has only a quadratic term in gradient magnitude .",
    "consequently , features that are visible only at large diffusion sensitivities ( e.g. , diffraction - like effects @xcite ) are not accomodated by the parabolic potential model .",
    "although this seems like a limitation of the model , for most acquisitions involving microscopic pores and weak gradients , the low diffusion sensitivity behavior is the only regime of the signal that can be measured . under these conditions ,",
    "the observed higher order terms emerge predominantly from heterogeneities within the sample rather than true compartmental effects .",
    "heterogeneity - induced effects would be captured by the present model as well if the signal is represented as the superposition of signals associated with a distribution of confinement values , i.e. , potentials , similar to what is done in multiple diffusion tensor @xcite and diffusion tensor distribution @xcite representations .    to illustrate the above points and better assess the resemblance of the hookean model to restricted diffusion , we consider molecules diffusing between two infinite parallel plates separated by @xmath113 m .",
    "for this geometry , the potential is zero within the slab and infinite at the walls .",
    "figure [ fig : compare2slab]a depicts the potential profile for the slab geometry ( continuous line ) as well as the parabolic potential ( dashed line ) that could be used in lieu of it . for the latter",

    "[ fig : compare2slab]b , we plot the signal against the quantity @xmath115 , which is frequently referred to as the `` b - value , '' and fully characterizes the signal decay for free diffusion @xcite . here , curves in different colors represent different values of the pulse duration . for each pulse duration ,",
    "the @xmath116-value was varied by changing the gradient magnitude .",
    "having different signal values for the same @xmath116-value is a further manifestation of the failure of the free diffusion model in characterizing restricted diffusion . employing the parabolic potential",
    "however , yields a behavior similar to that observed for restricted diffusion .",
    "we observe that the deviation between the signal values for restricted and hookean models becomes more pronounced as the @xmath116-value is increased .",
    "we show the dependence of the signal on the separation of pulses in figure [ fig : compare2slab]c . to be able to simulate shorter diffusion times , the pulse duration was fixed at @xmath117s .",
    "here , different colors represent different values of the wavenumber @xmath109 .",
    "as expected , the signals for both problems reach constant values as the pulse separation ( diffusion time ) is prolonged .",
    "the curves for the two models are nearly indistinguishable at small attenuations . for stronger diffusion sensitivity ,",
    "the transition to the long diffusion - time regime occurs slightly more quickly in the case of parabolic potential , yielding a larger eventual signal .",
    "we reiterate that the comparisons here are based on the association in , which is only one way of assigning a pore size to a particular confinement value .",

    "formerly , the path integral method was used to derive the expression describing the influence of free diffusion @xcite . in an earlier publication ,",
    "the quadratic term of the signal decay due to restricted diffusion was calculated via an explicit evaluation of the path integral for the simple geometries of parallel plates , cylinders , and spheres @xcite .",
    "employing the former two geometries in perpendicular directions , the solution for a capped cylinder geometry can be obtained @xcite , which had been used to model restricted diffusion in an anisotropic pore . however , because the capped cylinder is invariant to rotations about its axis , this model has only two size parameters  its radius and length , thus limiting its applicability . on the other hand , our model has three unique confinement values ( @xmath119 , where @xmath120 ) , each of which can be related to an effective pore size along three spatial directions . in this respect ,",
    "our model is more general than the capped cylinder geometry for modeling anisotropy .",
    "we note that an alternative geometry involving three size parameters is the rectangular prism .",
    "the mr signal influenced by diffusion within a rectangular prism could be obtained by employing the solution for parallel plates in three orthogonal directions . however , even when the three size parameters are set equal , the resulting geometry is not truly isotropic , making it difficult to isolate the influence of structural anisotropy .",
    "this limitation , which is present also for the capped cylinder geometry , is overcome by our method .",
    "setting all three principal confinement values equal to each other provides the solution for a perfectly isotropic potential akin to the case of diffusion taking place within a sphere . on the other hand , setting only two of the three eigenvalues of the confinement tensor equal to each other provides the solution for diffusion within a cylinder - like pore .",
    "as exemplified in figure [ fig : stejskaltanner_anisotropy ] , compared to the diffusion tensor model , which is based on the assumption of free diffusion , our model has a different dependence on the timing parameters of the gradient waveforms .",
    "this issue is likely to be important when sophisticated pulse sequences are employed . indeed",
    ", several different pulse sequences have been studied in recent years employing pulsed @xcite and continuous @xcite waveforms . especially in the context of modeling local diffusion anisotropy , one is faced with the choice between the gaussian diffusion tensor model @xcite , and restricted capped cylinder model @xcite . although , the restricted character of the model is desirable , the capped cylinder model had two limitations , which may have prompted some studies to adopt the diffusion tensor model instead : ( i ) it has only two size parameters , so is more limited than the diffusion tensor model , ( ii ) the solutions are rather complicated .",
    "we believe the confinement tensor model introduced in this study overcomes both of these limitations making it suitable to characterize global ( macroscopic ) as well as local ( microscopic ) diffusion in heterogeneous media .",
    "for example , `` diffusion imaging with confinement tensor ( dict ) '' could be performed by estimating the confinement tensor via eqs . and",
    "for each voxel of a data set comprising multi - directional diffusion - weighted images , much like eq .",
    "is employed in diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) studies .",
    "although our formulation has focused for the most part on parabolic potentials and linear gradients , the mcf and random walk simulations can be generalized to more general cases .",
    "for example , spatially nonlinear gradients can be incorporated with ease by simple manipulations of the operators employed in the mcf technique @xcite .",
    "other potentials can also be incorporated by employing exact or approximate solutions of the corresponding helmholtz problem .",
    "finally , the work presented in this article may be relevant in very different contexts .",
    "for example , our approach here could be expanded to offer some utility in modeling noise induced by brownian motion in magnetic resonance force microscopy @xcite .    in conclusion , we have presented an in - depth study on the effect of diffusion taking place in the presence of a parabolic potential on the nmr signal .",
    "the scheme enables one to incorporate restriction - induced effects when general gradient waveforms are employed .",
    "the study lends itself to a new formulation for diffusion anisotropy featuring three parameters like the diffusion tensor model .",
    "however , by overcoming the limitations due to the assumption of free diffusion , the confinement tensor model could be considered a powerful alternative to the diffusion tensor model for characterizing anisotropy .",

    "also , note how the integrals over later positions are nested inside those of the earlier ones .",
    "the above discussion holds for any ( time - independent ) potential and number of dimensions .",

    ", we shall consider the long time limit ( @xmath150 ) of the propagator .",
    "in this regime , the dependence on the initial position disappears as expected for restricted diffusion .",
    "it is instructive to also consider the net displacements , i.e. , @xmath151 . let @xmath152 denote the equilibrium spin density .",
    "the second moment of net displacements , defined through the expression @xmath153 diverges for free diffusion as the diffusion time is prolonged .",
    "however , the same quantity for the propagator in eq . asymptotically approaches the constant value of @xmath154 . on the other hand ,",
    "if one considers a restricted diffusion process taking place between two infinite plates separated by a distance @xmath155 , this quantity similarly approaches a constant value , which is @xmath156 .",
    "setting the latter two quantities equal to each other , one can obtain an effective pore size given by @xmath157 we refer to this relationship in the results section .",
    "the form of the propagator   helps a great deal in evaluating the signal analytically .",
    "indeed , the discretized path integral   involves only familiar integrals , but each integration is affected by the result of that nested immediately inside it .",
    "consider , for instance , the inner - most integral ( over @xmath158 ) : @xmath159 the first factor has nothing to do with the remaining integrals in eq .  .",
    "the second factor , on the other hand , combines with the exponential in the next integral ( over @xmath160 ) , shifting its `` wave number '' @xmath161 by an amount @xmath162 .",
    "one can see that , with later ( large index ) wave numbers leaking into the phase factors of earlier ( smaller index ) integrations as such , and getting multiplied by @xmath163 at each step , it should be useful to define @xmath164 ( the index @xmath165 is not to be confused with the imaginary unit @xmath166 . ) following this recursion just described , one finds @xmath167 we assume that the distribution of spin - carriers has had enough time to reach equilibrium before the gradient sequence is applied .",
    "hence , the relation @xmath168 can be employed ( eqs .",
    " in the limit @xmath169 ) , with @xmath170 being some arbitrary pre - initial position",

    "the most general harmonic potential ( assuming the attraction center is at the origin ) is of the form @xmath191 where the confinement tensor @xmath12 is real and can be assumed to be symmetric without loss of generality .",
