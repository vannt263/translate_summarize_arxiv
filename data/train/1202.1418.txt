    "it has recently become clear that galaxy discs evolve significantly over time due to both internal and external influences ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) . scattering by giant molecular clouds @xcite is now thought to play a minor role @xcite , while spirals @xcite and interactions @xcite are believed to cause more substantial changes .    the milky way is believed to have both a thin and a thick disc @xcite , as do perhaps many disc galaxies @xcite .",
    "relative to the thin disc , the thick disc has a higher velocity dispersion , lags in its net rotational velocity @xcite , contains older stars with lower metallicities @xcite and enhanced [ @xmath0/fe ] ratios @xcite .",
    "a number of different criteria have been used to divide stars into the two disc populations , and some of these trends may depend somewhat on whether a spatial , kinematic , or chemical abundance criterion is applied @xcite . recently , @xcite suggest that there is no sharp distinction into two populations , but rather a continuous variation in these properties .",
    "several models have been proposed for the formation of the thick disc : accretion of disrupted satellite galaxies @xcite , thickening of an early thin disc by a minor merger @xcite , star formation triggered during galaxy assembly @xcite , and radial migration @xcite . while it is likely that no single mechanism plays a unique role in its formation , our focus in this paper is on radial migration .",
    "as first shown by @xcite , spiral activity in a disc causes stars to diffuse radially over time .",
    "stars near corotation of a spiral pattern experience large angular momentum changes of either sign that move them to new radii without adding random motion . as spirals are recurring transient disturbances that have corotation radii scattered over a wide swath of the disc ,",
    "the net effect is that stars execute a random walk in radius with a step size ranging up to @xmath1kpc , which results in strong radial mixing .",
    "note that this mechanism is distinct from the `` blurring '' caused by epicycle oscillations of stars about their home radii , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 in the midplane and @xmath4 is the gravitational potential .",
    "radial mixing is dubbed `` churning '' and causes the home radii themselves to change .",
    "note that radial mixing caused by recurrent transient spirals has two related properties that distinguish it from other processes that have sometimes also been said to cause radial migration .",
    "the two distinctive properties are the absence of disc heating , already noted , and the fact that stars mostly change places , causing little change to the distribution of angular momentum within the disc and leaving the surface density profile unchanged . these are both features of scattering at corotation ; spirals also cause smaller angular momentum changes at lindblad resonances which do heat and spread the disc .",
    "bar formation causes greater angular momentum changes than those of an individual spiral pattern @xcite .",
    "however , because the bar persists after its formation , the associated angular momentum changes have a different character from those caused by a spiral that grows and decays quickly .",
    "bar formation changes the radial distribution of angular momentum , and therefore also the surface density profile of the disc , as well as adding a substantial amount of radial motion @xcite .",
    "although the bar may subsequently settle , grow , and/or slow down over time , the main changes associated with its formation probably occur only once in a galaxy s lifetime ( for a dissenting view see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas spirals seem to recur indefinitely as long as gas and star formation sustain the responsiveness of the disc .",
    "thus angular momentum changes in the outer disc beyond the bar should ultimately be dominated by the effects of radial mixing by dynamically - unrelated transient spirals , as we find in this paper .",
    "note that @xcite studied the separate physical process of resonance overlap using steadily rotating potentials to represent a bar and spiral , and therefore did not address possible mixing by transient spirals in a barred galaxy model .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite find that external bombardment of the disc can enhance radial motion through the increase in the central attraction and also through possible angular momentum changes .",
    "however , the importance of bombardment is unclear since satellites may be dissolved by tidal shocking @xcite before they settle , and furthermore satellite accretion to the inner milky way over the past @xmath5 years is strongly constrained by the dominant old age of thick disc stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered spiral churning in 2d simulations , and it has been shown to occur in fully 3d simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite present a model for galactic chemical evolution that includes radial mixing , and point out @xcite that it naturally gives rise to both a thin and a thick disc , under the assumption that thick disc stars experience a similar radial churning .",
    "@xcite show that extensive spiral activity in their simulations causes a thick disc to develop , and present a detailed comparison with data @xcite from sdss @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also generated galaxies with realistic break radii in the exponential surface brightness profiles using cosmological @xmath6-body hydrodynamic simulations that included radial migration .",
    "however , @xcite report that no significant thick discs developed in their simulations .",
    "@xcite find evidence for radial mixing in the thin disc and for a downtrend of rotational velocity with metallicity .",
    "the presence of such a trend does not rule out migration in the thick disc , but shows that mixing for the oldest stars can not be complete .",
    "@xcite find a continuous change of abundance - dependent disc structure with increasing scale height and decreasing scale length which they note is the `` almost inevitable consequence of radial migration '' .",
    "the decreasing metallicity gradient with age of milky way disc stars can also be attributed to radial mixing @xcite .    while @xcite present circumstantial evidence for radial migration in the thick disc , they do not show explicitly that it is occurring , neither do they attempt to quantify the extent to which it may be reduced by the weakened responses of thick disc stars to spiral waves in the thin disc .",
    "@xcite find that mixing is more extensive when spiral activity is invigorated by star formation , although the level of spiral activity is strongly dependent on the `` gastrophysical '' prescription adopted .",
    "they show that mixing persists even for particles with large oscillations about the mid - plane , and they determine migration probabilities from their simulations .    in this paper , we set ourselves the limited goal of determining the extent of radial migration in isolated , collisionless discs with various thicknesses and radial velocity dispersions that are subject to transient spiral perturbations .",
    "following @xcite , we first present controlled simulations of two - component discs constructed so as to support an isolated , large - amplitude spiral wave , in order to study the detailed mechanism of migration in the separate thin and thick discs .",
    "we also report the responses of two - component discs to multiple spiral patterns , both with and without a bar .",
    "all our models use the constant velocity disc known as the mestel disc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bt08 ) .",
    "linear stability analysis by ( * ? ? ?",

    "we therefore adopt this stable model for the thin disc , and superimpose a thick disc of active particles that has @xmath7 of the mass of the thin disc .",
    "the remaining mass is in the form of a rigid halo , set up to ensure that the total central attraction in the midplane is that of the razor - thin , full - mass , untapered mestel disc .",
    "ideally , we would like to select particles from a distribution function ( ) for a thickened mestel disc .",
    "@xcite found a family of flattened models that are generalizations of the razor - thin zang discs that have the isothermal @xmath8 vertical density profile @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these two - integral models have equal velocity dispersions in the radial direction and normal to the disc plane ( see bt08 ) , whereas we would like to set up models with flattened velocity ellipsoids .",
    "since no three - integral  for a realistic disc galaxy model is known , as far as we are aware , we start from the two - integral  for the razor - thin disc @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a particle s specific energy and @xmath11 its specific @xmath12-angular momentum .",
    "the free parameter @xmath13 is related to the nominal radial component of the velocity dispersion through @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the circular orbital speed at all radii .",
    "the value of toomre s local stability parameter for a single component , razor - thin mestel disc would be @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the active fraction of mass in the component ; note that these expressions for both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are independent of radius .",
    "a composite model having two thickened discs , such as we employ here , will have some effective @xmath19 that is not so easily expressed .",
    "we choose different values of @xmath18 for the thin and thick discs , given in table  [ tab : simulations ] below , in order that the thick disc has a greater radial velocity dispersion , as observed for the milky way .",
    "we limit the radial extent of the discs by inner and outer tapers @xmath20[1+(l_z / l_o)^6]},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the central angular momentum values of the inner and outer tapers respectively .",
    "the exponents are chosen so as not to provoke instabilities ( toomre , private communication ) .",
    "we employ the same taper function for both discs and choose @xmath23 .",
    "we further restrict the extent of the disc by eliminating all particles whose orbits would take them beyond @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the central radius of the inner taper .",
    "this additional truncation is sufficiently far out that the active mass density is already substantially reduced by the outer taper .     and",
    "is broadened by epicycle excursions .",

    "( [ zprof ] ) because it approaches @xmath31 more rapidly , as suggested by data @xcite ; @xmath29 is therefore the exponential scale height when @xmath32 .",
    "we set the vertical scale height of the thick disc to be three times that of the thin disc , as suggested for the milky way @xcite .",
    "we estimate the equilibrium vertical velocity dispersion at each @xmath12-height by integrating the 1d jeans equation ( bt08 , eq .",
    "4.271 ) in our numerically - determined potential .",
    "this procedure is adequate when the radial velocity dispersion is low , but the vertical balance degrades in populations having larger initial radial motions , which flare outwards as the model relaxes from initial conditions , as shown below .",
    "the tapered thin mestel disc has a surface density that declines with radius as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : run94surfdn ] .",
    "while there is no radial range that is closely exponential , we estimate an approximately equivalent exponential radial scale length @xmath33 as shown by the blue line .",
    "accordingly , we choose @xmath34 for the thin disc so that the ratio @xmath35 is similar to that of the milky way and the average volume - corrected ratio of @xmath36(@xmath37 ) found by @xcite for 34 nearby galaxies .",
    "the values we adopt for each model are given in table  [ tab : simulations ] below .",
    "the radial gravitational potential gradient in the midplane of our model is less than that of the full - mass , razor - thin , infinite mestel disc as a result of the reduced disc surface density , the angular momentum tapers , the finite thickness of the discs , and gravitational force softening . in order to create an approximate equilibrium",

    ", the amplitudes of the vertical oscillations increase due to the weaker average restoring force when @xmath74 , and conversely decrease for @xmath74 .",
    "thus if an estimator of vertical motion is not conserved , we should expect a systematic variation with @xmath54 , as we observe for all the energy estimators in fig .",
    "[ fig : run94ezchlch ] .",
    "the fact that there is no systematic variation of the median or mean change in vertical action suggest that it is conserved .",
    "if @xmath59 is a conserved quantity , it may seem puzzling that the rms changes in our measurements are not smaller . both @xmath75 and @xmath58 are approximate , which could be responsible for apparent substantial changes , but changes in the `` exact '' estimate of @xmath59 remain significant , even for simulation t. it is possible that our estimate of @xmath42 is inaccurate .",
    "for example , we must eliminate non - axisymmetric structure from the potential to compute @xmath59 , introducing small errors when the potential is mildly non - axisymmetric .",
    "larger differences could arise , however , if the invariant curve changes its character , especially since entering or leaving a trapped area in phase space is not an adiabatic change .",
    "it is possible an orbit that appears to be unaffected by resonant islands in phase space at the initial and final times could have experienced trapping about resonant islands for some of the intermediate evolution , allowing @xmath59 to change even when changes to the potential are indeed slow .",
    "we have verified that @xmath59 is conserved to a part in @xmath76 in a further simulation with a frozen , axisymmetric potential .",
    "note this is not a totally trivial test , since we use the @xmath6-body integrator and the grid - determined accelerations to advance the motion for @xmath77 dynamical times before making our second estimate .",
    "therefore the non - zero changes in simulation t are indeed caused by changes to the potential . even though the potential variations are small",
    ", substantial action changes indicate that changes to the orbit were non - adiabatic , which can happen for the reason given in the previous paragraph .",
    "our `` initial '' @xmath59 values are estimated at @xmath78 , when we believe the model has relaxed from the initial set up ; we therefore suspect that the small potential variations are more probably driven by particle noise , which can be enhanced by collective modes @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by our finding variations in @xmath59 that were about ten times greater than in simulation t when we employed 100 times fewer particles .",
    "we have presented a quantitative study of the extent of radial migration in both thin and thick discs in response to a single spiral wave .",
    "we find angular momentum changes in the thick disc are generally smaller than those in the thin , although the tail to the largest changes in each population is almost equally extensive .",
    "we have introduced populations of test particles into a number of our simulations in order to determine how changes in @xmath11 vary with disc thickness and with radial velocity dispersion when subject to the same spiral wave , finding an exponential decrease in @xmath79 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : run102103rmslch ] .",
    "we find that spirals of smaller spatial scale cause smaller changes .",
    "when we were careful to change all the properties of the model by the appropriate factors , we were able to account for smaller changes to @xmath79 as being due to a combination of the weakened spiral amplitude near corotation and the change in the value of @xmath80 . furthermore , we found evidence that the saturation amplitude scales inversely as @xmath80 , in line with the theory developed by @xcite .",
    "note the simple scaling holds true only when the principal dynamical properties , such as @xmath19 , @xmath81 , thickness , and gravity softening , are held fixed relative to the scale of the mode .",
    "nevertheless , it seems reasonable to expect smaller changes to @xmath79 in general for spirals higher @xmath80 .",
    "the exponential decrease of @xmath79 with increasing disc thickness applies only for different populations subject to the same spiral perturbation .",
    "we have also run slightly more realistic simulations to follow the extent of churning in both thick and thin discs that are subject to large numbers of transient spiral waves having a variety of rotational symmetries . fig .",
    "[ fig : run104rhfrhi ] shows that changes in the home radii of thick disc particles are smaller on average than those of the thin disc , but again the tails of the distributions in both populations are almost co - extensive .",
    "as found in previous work @xcite , the formation of a bar also causes substantial angular momentum changes within a disc , but we find that the churning effect from multiple spiral patterns still dominates changes in the outer disc after the bar has formed .    we find that vertical action is conserved during radial migration , despite the fact that relative changes in our estimated @xmath59 , which can be measured for only about half the particles , are as large as @xmath82 . because the vertical restoring force to the mid - plane decreases outwards , an increased ( decreased ) home radius causes the particle to experience a systematically weaker ( stronger ) vertical restoring force , making it impossible for both vertical energy and action to be conserved .",
    "we find a clear systematic variation of the vertical energy with @xmath54 , but none with @xmath42 leading us to conclude that vertical action is the conserved quantity .",
    "the residual scatter in our measured values of @xmath42 could be caused by trapping and escape from multiply - periodic resonant islands in phase space , as well as numerical jitter in the @xmath6-body potential , as we discuss at the end of  6 . in the absence of these complications , we believe that the vertical action is conserved",
    ".    thus conservation of vertical action , and not of vertical energy , should be used to prescribe the changes to vertical motion in models of chemo - dynamic evolution .",
    "it would be especially useful to obtain diffusion coefficients that include the effects of radial migration as functions of radius and height due to a transient spiral or a combination of consecutive spirals with various corotation radii .",

    "also , had we chosen the negative root for initial radial velocity , the particle would have circulated only counterclockwise and yielded a @xmath87-rotationally symmetric invariant curve in the third quadrant .",
    "this accounts for the skewness of the invariant curves in the sos , which diminishes for particles of lower energy .",
