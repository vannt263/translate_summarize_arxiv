    "the kerr geometry is a vacuum spacetime with a weyl tensor of petrov type d. according to the goldberg - sachs theorem @xcite , it therefore possesses two congruences ( ingoing and outgoing ) of shear - free lightlike geodesics .",
    "historically , these congruences played an essential role in the discovery of the kerr solution @xcite , because the metric takes a simple explicit form in coordinates adapted to them .    in the original @xcite,@xcite ( eddington - kerr ) form of the metric ,",
    "the ingoing congruence consists of parametric curves of the eddington- kerr coordinate @xmath1 , often referred to as an `` advanced time '' .",
    "this nomenclature can be misleading , because hypersurfaces of constant @xmath1 are actually spacelike , not lightlike , if the kerr rotational parameter @xmath2 is nonzero .",
    "( the lightlike congruences are  twisting \" , i.e. , not orthogonal to any hypersurfaces , and hence not tangent to lightlike hypersurfaces if @xmath3 ) .    thus , the eddington - kerr form of the metric , and the boyer - lindquist form @xcite derived from it by an elementary coordinate transformation , correspond to a `` threading '' @xcite ( i.e. , a one - dimensional foliation ) of the manifold by twisting lightlike geodesics .",
    "however , a  slicing \" ( three dimensional foliation ) , in particular a light - like slicing , is for many purposes more advantageous and often corresponds more closely to the physics .",
    "light cones of the kerr geometry have not previously been a subject of systematic study to our knowledge .",
    "perhaps this stems in part from a feeling that such hypersurfaces would quickly develop caustics because of the twist inherent in the metric . yet as characteristics these surfaces obviously play a key role in the physics of kerr black holes , e.g in the propagation of wave fronts and high - frequency waves , and in characteristic initial value problems .    in this paper",
    "we first derive the general solution for axisymmetric lightlike hypersurfaces of the kerr geometry ( sec .",
    "[ formal_sol ] ) .",
    "we then focus on a particular foliation ( invariant under time - displacement ) by ( either ingoing or outgoing )  quasi - spherical \" light cones , defined as degenerate 3-spaces whose spatial sections are asymptotically spherical at infinity .",
    "these hypersurfaces become the standard minkowski light cones when the kerr mass parameter @xmath4 vanishes ; if @xmath5 , @xmath6 , they are the familiar spherical light cones , @xmath7 , of schwarzschild spacetime ( where @xmath8 is the  tortoise \" coordinate ) . quite generally ,",
    "for arbitrary @xmath9 and @xmath2 , they have the remarkable property of being free of caustics for all positive values of the kerr radial coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "these appealing features suggest that coordinates adapted to quasi- spherical surfaces should be especially convenient and useful for the description of the kerr geometry .",
    "the drawback ( and it is considerable ) is that the metric is no longer expressible in an explicit elementary form , because the new coordinates are elliptic functions of the boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "we now briefly outline the contents of the paper .",
    "we begin in sec . 2 by solving the eikonal equation for axisymmetric lightlike hypersufaces of the kerr geometry .",
    "the general solution is expressed in terms of integrals of elliptic type , and involves an arbitrary function @xmath10 of one variable , to be fixed when the `` initial '' ( e.g. asymptotic ) shape of the surface is given .",
    "( if @xmath11 the geometry becomes flat and the integrals can be reduced to elementary form ; in sec .",
    "3 we digress briefly to illustrate this . ) some general properties of axisymmetric lightlike surfaces are developed in sec .",
    "4 . in sec . 5 , guided by the results of sec . 3 for minkowski light cones",
    ", we make the special choice of @xmath10 appropriate for asymptotically spherical light cones in kerr space .",
    "the key result , that these are free of caustics for @xmath12 , is demonstrated in sec .",
    "6 . in secs . 7 and 8",
    "we show how the  quasi - spherical \" coordinates @xmath8 , @xmath13 defined by these light cones can be used to construct high - frequency solutions to the wave equation and kruskal - like coordinates for kerr black holes .",
    "9 summarizes the limiting cases that can provide serviceable approximations for the elliptic functions which appear in the quasi - spherical form of the metric . finally , in sec .",
    "10 we present some results of numerical integrations for the inward evolution of the light cone generators .",
    "the equation of an arbitrary axially symmetric lightlike hypersurface of the kerr geometry is expressible in terms of elliptic integrals as we now proceed to show .",
    "we write the kerr metric in its standard ( boyer - lindquist ) form    @xmath14    where    @xmath15    and we note the useful identities    @xmath16    @xmath17    the equation    @xmath18    represents an axisymmetric lightlike hypersurface ( ingoing for @xmath19 , outgoing for @xmath20 ) if @xmath21 , i.e. , if    @xmath22    it is easy to obtain a particular ( separable ) solution of ( [ pde ] ) depending on two arbitrary constants ( a `` complete integral '' ) by adding and subtracting an arbitrary separation constant @xmath23 on the right -hand side .",
    "let us define    @xmath24    ( note the useful identity    @xmath25    which follows from ( [ ident ] ) . ) a complete integral    @xmath26    of ( [ pde ] ) is then obtained by integrating the exact differential    @xmath27    at fixed @xmath28 .",
    "when ( [ drb ] ) is integrated , a second , additive integration constant appears which we shall denote as @xmath29 , where @xmath10 is an arbitrary function .",
    "we next proceed in the usual way to promote this complete integral , depending upon the arbitrary constants @xmath28 and @xmath30 , to a general solution involving an arbitrary function .    in ( [ rho ] ) , @xmath31 is a function of three independent variables @xmath0 , @xmath32 and @xmath28 ( not counting @xmath4 and @xmath2 ) , and a more complete expression for its differential is    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the partial derivative    @xmath35    its explicit form may be taken to be    @xmath36    up to now , we have taken @xmath28 to be a constant , i.e. , @xmath37 in ( [ drho ] ) .",
    "but we achieve the same effect ( i.e. , ( [ drho ] ) still reduces to ( [ drb ] ) ) even when @xmath38 provided we require that @xmath39 . in other words : the function @xmath40 , given by ( [ rho ] ) with @xmath28 now a _ function _",
    "@xmath41 , remains a solution of ( [ pde ] ) provided its extra dependence on @xmath42 through @xmath28 does not change the algebraic form of the differential ( [ drb ] ) .",
    "this will indeed be so if we impose the constraint    @xmath43    this condition fixes the dependence of @xmath28 on @xmath42 for any given choice of @xmath30 .",
    "thus we now have a general solution , depending upon an arbitrary _ function _ @xmath44 $ ] .",
    "the explicit form of the general solution ( [ rho ] ) is then    @xmath45    where the radial dependence has been arranged to ensure convergence of the definite integral at its upper limit .",
    "when performing the integrations in ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ solution ] ) , we are allowed to treat @xmath28 as merely a passive constant parameter ",
    "it is in fact a function of the limits of integration @xmath0,@xmath32 , not of the integration variables  with the constraint ( [ constraint ] ) imposed _ a posteriori_. it is possible , though not especially illuminating or useful , to express each of these integrals in terms of standard elliptic integrals .",
    "as a simple illustrative example ( and because we shall need some of the results later ) , we specialize in this section to the case @xmath11 .",
    "the kerr line - element reduces to the metric of flat spacetime expressed in terms of oblate spheroidal coordinates @xmath42  related to cartesians by    @xmath46    the second integral in ( [ f2 ] ) can be reduced to the same general form as the first integral when @xmath11 .",
    "assume that we are in a domain where @xmath47 .",
    "setting    @xmath48    and making the substution    @xmath49    we find    @xmath50    thus the two integrals in ( [ f2 ] ) can be combined into a single integral , to give    @xmath51    where    @xmath52    and the form of @xmath53 is given by the `` unprimed '' version of ( [ sub ] ) ; equivalently ,    @xmath54    the function @xmath55 is arbitrary . as an example , let us consider the simplest choice , @xmath56 .",
    "the functional dependence @xmath41 corresponding to this choice is determined by the constraint @xmath39 , which requires that @xmath57 by inspection of ( [ f_m0 ] ) .",
    "thus ( [ theta_s ] ) gives    @xmath58    by ( [ oblate ] ) , showing that @xmath13 is the spherical polar angle . with @xmath41",
    "known from ( [ theta_s2 ] ) , it is straightforward to integrate ( [ drb ] ) to obtain    @xmath59    thus @xmath8 is the usual spherical radius , and our solutions @xmath60 of ( [ pde ] ) are in this case the minkowski light cones .",
    "returning to the general case , we shall now derive a number of results applicable to all axisymmetric lightlike hypersurfaces of kerr .",
    "since the function @xmath41 is determined by the constraint @xmath39 , the partial derivatives of @xmath28 can be read off from @xmath61 ( [ f2 ] ) :    @xmath62    it follows from ( [ drb ] ) and ( [ dl_mu ] ) that @xmath63 , i.e. that @xmath8 and @xmath28 are orthogonal with respect to the intrinsic 2-metric    @xmath64    of the spatial sections @xmath65 of the kerr geometry . since @xmath28 is independent of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , it follows further that _",
    "@xmath28 is constant along the lightlike generators _",
    ", i.e. ,    @xmath68    if @xmath8 and @xmath28 are adopted as coordinates in place of @xmath0 and @xmath32 , the 2-metric ( [ 2metric ] ) becomes    @xmath69    where we have made use of ( [ drb ] ) , ( [ dl_mu ] ) and ( [ ident2 ] ) . the identity ( [ det ] )",
    "can be re - arranged in the form    @xmath70    where    @xmath71    is the bardeen or zamo angular velocity @xmath72 which characterizes orbits having zero angular momentum .",
    "this enables us to recast the kerr metric ( [ kerr ] ) in the form    @xmath73    thus    @xmath74    from which the null character of the 3-spaces @xmath7 is directly evident .",
    "the degenerate intrinsic metric of these 3-spaces is    @xmath75    showing that the generators rotate with @xmath76 angular velocity relative to stationary observers at infinity .",
    "( this is directly obvious from ( [ lconst ] ) , which shows that @xmath77 for an axisymmetric hypersurface ) . from ( [ dsll ] )",
    "we see that caustics will develop when the degenerate volume element tends to zero , i.e. when @xmath78 ( recalling that @xmath28 has a fixed value along each generator ) .",
    "the integrability of ( [ dl_mu ] ) for the exact differential @xmath79 provides a condition on the integrating factor @xmath80 .",
    "this takes the form of an evolution equation for @xmath80 along the generators . a straightforward calculation , which calls upon ( [ pq ] ) , ( [ ident2 ] ) , ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ dl_mu ] ) itself , yields    @xmath81    where the subscript @xmath28 indicates that the partial derivative is being taken at fixed @xmath28 .    inversion of the differential relations ( [ drb ] ) and ( [ dl_mu ] ) gives    @xmath82    which will be of use in subsequent sections .",
    "from here on we confine attention to a special class , `` quasi - spherical light cones '' , defined as lightlike hypersurfaces which asymptotically approach minkowski spherical light cones at infinity . define an angle @xmath83 by    @xmath84    in minkowski space , the generators @xmath85 of light cones are radial straight lines , suggesting ( as we confirmed in sec .",
    "[ case_m_0 ] ) that @xmath13 is the spherical polar angle . for @xmath86 ,",
    "the oblate coordinates @xmath87 become indistinguishable from spherical coordinates , so we have the condition    @xmath88    for spherical light cones in minkowski space .",
    "this asymptotic condition must therefore also hold for quasi - spherical surfaces in kerr space .",
    "this fixes the arbitrary function @xmath89 in ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that    @xmath90    generates the solution for quasi - spherical surfaces .",
    "the radial function @xmath91 is given by ( [ solution ] ) with ( compare ( [ g ] ) with @xmath56 )    @xmath92    the equation of the hypersurface is then @xmath93 , with @xmath94 and the function @xmath95 determined by the constraint @xmath39 .",
    "we now prove the rather remarkable result that quasi - spherical light cones are free of caustics for all positive values of the kerr radial coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "this is trivially true if @xmath11 , when these surfaces are simply light cones in minkowski space with vertices at the spatial origin , represented by @xmath96 , @xmath97 or @xmath98 in oblate spheroidal coordinates according to ( [ oblate ] ) .",
    "we shall prove that it is true _ a fortiori _ for @xmath99 by effectively showing that when @xmath4 is larger , the generators converge _ less _ rapidly as @xmath100 .    as noted in sec .",
    "[ gen_prop ] , formation of a caustic along a generator is signalled by    @xmath101    we consider in turn the behaviour of each factor in ( [ caust ] ) along an ingoing generator , so that @xmath0 is positive and decreasing , with @xmath28 fixed . because of the equatorial symmetry we need only consider `` northern '' generators , i.e. , we may assume @xmath13 ( which specifies the initial , asymptotic value of @xmath32 when @xmath102 ) to be acute , and @xmath103 positive , at least initially .",
    "( note from ( [ drb ] ) that equatorial symmetry of @xmath40 implies @xmath104 . )",
    "since @xmath32 decreases with @xmath0 at fixed @xmath28 according to ( [ dl_mu ] ) , the factor @xmath105 must _ increase _ and remain positive .",
    "any possible caustic in the kerr positive-@xmath0 sheet can not arise from the behaviour of @xmath106 .",
    "we proceed to consider the other factors in ( [ caust ] ) . from the definition ( [ pq ] ) ,    @xmath107    we shall further show that    @xmath108    thus , none of the three factors @xmath80 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 can reach zero sooner for positive @xmath4 than they do in flat space , and hence they do not reach zero for any positive value of @xmath0 .    to establish ( [ tiq ] ) , we note that the function @xmath111 is determined by the vanishing of @xmath112 as given by ( [ fqs ] ) . taking the differential at fixed @xmath0,@xmath28 and using ( [ pq ] )",
    "gives    @xmath113    which is manifestly positive .",

    "this completes the proof .",
    "the fact that adding mass to the kerr field should _ reduce _ the focusing of ingoing radial light rays is at first sight paradoxical , but can be explained by the circumstance that the material source is not at the origin , but located on the singular equatorial ring @xmath119 , @xmath120 ( see ( [ oblate ] ) ) .",
    "the source has a peculiar , `` demi - pole '' structure @xcite , made possible by the double - sheeted structure of the kerr manifold : a ring of positive mass in the sheet @xmath121 is bonded to a ring of negative mass in the sheet @xmath122 .",
    "light rays heading inwards toward the origin in the sheet @xmath121 are deflected outward by the ring and defocused .",
    "repulsive effects have become dominant by the time they pass through the disk @xmath123 the rays are then refocused and form a caustic in the sheet @xmath122 . this description is more than just hand - waving : the keres newtonian analogue model of the kerr field @xcite has a source structure and equations of motion closely resembling kerr ( apart from frame dragging ) , and displays precisely this behaviour .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] ( a result of numerical integrations described in sec .",

    "defining an angular function    @xmath135    and recalling ( [ dr_rb]),we find    @xmath136    therefore ( [ wave2 ] ) can be rewritten    @xmath137    if @xmath133 is large , we can apply an iterative procedure to ( [ wave3 ] ) and ( [ b ] ) to develop the solution for @xmath138 in inverse powers of @xmath133 . in the lowest approximation",
    ", we simply equate the coefficient of @xmath133 in ( [ wave3 ] ) to zero .",
    "this yields the `` eikonal approximation ''    @xmath139    with an arbitrary function @xmath30 . by linear superposition",
    "we can build from this an arbitrary high - frequency solution    @xmath140    where @xmath34 is an arbitrary function of its three arguments varying rapidly with time .    from ( [ eik ] ) and ( [ wb2 ] ) we see that crests of high - frequency azimuthal ( @xmath66-dependent ) waves twist about the axis with angular frequency @xmath134 , the zamo angular velocity .",
    "because @xmath134 and @xmath141 depend on @xmath28 , propagation of azimuthal waves produces latitude - dependent phase shifts .",
    "the latitude - dependence is , however , always bounded , even when @xmath142 at horizons .    in particular , wave - tails propagating inwards from the event to the cauchy horizon of a spinning black hole experience a blueshift which is modulated by an oscillatory , latitude - dependent factor when @xmath143  an effect first noted by ori @xcite",
    "however , since @xmath144 is no larger than the multipole order @xmath145 , this effect is more than offset by the natural power- law decay of the higher multipole wave - modes with advanced time @xmath1 , @xmath146 . it does not affect the uniformity of the leading- order divergence @xmath147 of blueshift at the cauchy horizon , where @xmath148 ( the inner - horizon surface gravity ) is a constant .",
    "these features , which are expected to extend at least qualitatively to waves having ( initially ) lower frequencies , are important when considering the back - reaction of blueshifted wave - tails on the geometry near the cauchy horizon @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to transform the kerr metric ( [ kerr_zamo ] ) into a kruskal - like form .",

    "the last term , involving the boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath66 and @xmath67 , is not .",
    "we therefore define the advanced and retarded angular coordinates @xmath162 , @xmath163 by    @xmath164    where @xmath141 was defined in ( [ alpha ] ) .",

    ".    is there a single azimuthal coordinate which regularizes the metric simultaneously on both past and future sheets of ( say ) the outer horizon , including the bifurcation surface ?",

    "we briefly mention that following standard methods one could construct a penrose diagram of the kerr spacetime using the kruskal - like coordinates ( [ uv ] ) , valid up to formation of the caustic surface .",
    "such a diagram would not look any different from the usual textbook examples @xcite except that a _ single _",
    "2-dimensional diagram is all that would be needed to illustrate the causal structure of the spacetime .",
    "this is because the ingoing ( @xmath174 ) and outgoing ( @xmath175 ) lightlike congruences intersect at surfaces of constant @xmath8 , represented by a single point on a diagram where the compactified coordinate system is derived from ( [ uv ] ) .",
    "the causal future of observers on the surface of intersection is entirely contained within the future - directed wedge of @xmath175 , @xmath174 ( as is evident from ( [ kerr_zamo ] ) by noting that when @xmath176 the line - element is spacelike ) .",
