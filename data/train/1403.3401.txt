    "according to the present understanding , the matter content of the universe is dominated by a very weakly interacting component : the dark matter ( dm ) . in the most promising scenarios ,",
    "dm consists of a thermal relic density of stable and weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "in fact , miraculously , particles with masses and annihilation cross sections set by the electroweak scale automatically yield the observed value for dm density , through the freeze - out mechanism ( for a review , see  @xcite ) . on the experimental side ,",
    "the wimp paradigm motivates the efforts aimed to the detection of three types of dm signature : elastic scattering between dm and sm particles , production of dm particles at colliders and annihilation of dm particles in the universe .",
    "in particular , for the latter case , it is essential to search for direct annihilation signals from dense dm regions , as well as studying the implied indirect large scale effects that , for example , would affect cmb .    in this regard ,",
    "the center of our galactic dm halo at the galactic center ( gc ) should provide the strongest annihilation signal .",
    "unfortunately , gc also harbours an extremely dense environment filled with stars , stellar relics and related cosmic rays , dust and gas . as a consequence the possible annihilation signals",
    "can easily be disguised as result of active astrophysical processes . in spite of that",
    ", different hints of dm annihilation have been reported in literature in recent years pointing towards the dm annihilation cross sections at the order of the thermal freeze - out one , @xmath4 . in 2008 ,",
    "the pamela satellite mission measured an excess of cosmic positrons above the energy of 20  gev , later confirmed by fermi lat and ams-02 @xcite . in 2009 , instead , the public data of fermi lat  @xcite showed a spatially extended @xmath0-ray excess at 1 - 5  gev at gc  @xcite . in 2012 , a hint of a @xmath0-ray line(s ) at 130  gev was found @xcite .    on the other hand , strong constraints from xenon100 [ 8 ] and lux [ 9 ] direct detection experiments recently excluded scattering cross sections near the typical weak - scale value .",
    "hence , with the new exclusion bounds approaching the predicted region , both the above claims and the wimp paradigm itself have started to tremble .",
    "fortunately , it is still possible to construct rather natural particle physical models that possess an annihilation cross section large enough to explain the detected signal , but , at the same time , present a suppressed dm - nucleon scattering cross section .",
    "a minimal and elegant example is provided by the so - called `` coy dark matter '' ( cdm ) , recently proposed by boehm  et  al  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the dm particle is a dirac fermion which interacts with the standard model ( sm ) particles by the exchange of a relatively light pseudoscalar mediator .",
    "the new couplings to the sm particles are assumed to be proportional to the corresponding higgs yukawa couplings , as motivated by minimal flavor violation [ 42 ] .",
    "hence , if the mass of the dm particle @xmath5 is below the mass of top quark , the dominant annihilation channel is @xmath6 . with the choice @xmath7",
    "gev the spatially extended @xmath0-ray excess at 1 - 5  gev at gc can be fitted for a natural value of the dm annihilation cross section @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the @xmath9 channel can fit the signal , provided a lower mass for @xmath5 is adopted : @xmath10  gev . in this case",
    "the sm yukawa structure adopted for the sm - pseudoscalar couplings in the cdm model is also to be modified .",
    "for instance , a viable model is achieved by assuming leptophilic sm - pseudoscalar couplings , i.e. by maintaining the yukawa structure only for the sm leptons and by neglecting the coupling of the pseudoscalar mediator to quarks .    intriguingly , a light pseudoscalar coupled to muons , as proposed by cdm , results in a new contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of this particle , @xmath11  @xcite . to this regard , among dm , neutrino masses and baryon asymmetry ,",
    "the @xmath12 deviation of @xmath11 from the sm value is a compelling experimental evidence that points to physics beyond sm ( for a review see  @xcite and references therein ) . in this study , we calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of electron , muon and tau in the framework of cdm , aiming to constrain and fit both the measured value of @xmath13 and the @xmath0-ray excess at 1 - 5  gev from gc .",
    "we will show that the pseudoscalar - muon coupling has to be enhanced by a factor @xmath14 to fit @xmath13 . within the cdm framework this if forbidden by the studies on the @xmath15 resonance decays , which constrain the pseudoscalar - muon coupling below the required value @xcite .",
    "however , this constraint is trivially avoided in case of leptophilic cdm , where the @xmath9 channel is responsible for fitting the 1 - 5  gev @xmath0-ray excess at gc .",
    "we will therefore show that the leptophilic cdm scenario allows to explain @xmath13 , to fit the @xmath0-ray excess at 1 - 5  gev from gc and to avoid the remaining well known constraints .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of muon , electron and tau within the cdm framework . in sec .",
    "iii discuss the constraints on cdm from @xmath16 and the resulting scenario . finally , in sec .",
    "iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "the prototype model we consider in this study is the cdm one , presented by boehm  et  al  @xcite .",
    "dm is composed by fermions @xmath5 with mass @xmath17 having interaction with the sm content via a pseudo - scalar field @xmath18 of mass @xmath19 .",
    "the interaction is governed by the lagrangian @xmath20 where @xmath21 runs on the sm fermions and @xmath22 being @xmath23  gev , the higgs boson vacuum expectation value .",
    "the factor @xmath24 is set to 1 in the original approach by boehm  et  al  @xcite . naturally , for @xmath25 , the couplings @xmath26 replicate the exact structure of the sm yukawa couplings .",
    "however , as we will now show , in order to fit @xmath13 it is necessary to impose @xmath27 , amplifying by net the sm yukawa hierarchy .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of a fermion can be quantified in @xmath28 clearly , for the lagrangian  , at one loop level the magnetic moment of all the fermions receive a new contribution from the exchange of a pseudo - scalar particle , which amounts to @xcite : @xmath29 notice that @xmath30 therefore @xmath31 . at the two loop level ,",
    "the pseudo - scalar mediator brings two further contributions to the anomalous coupling of the fermions ( see fig . 1 in  @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows the absolute value of these additional contributions at one plus two loop level , @xmath43 , in units of the standard deviation of the corresponding anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "we present both the cases of electron and muon , while the tau is excluded due to the huge uncertainties that plague the measurement .",
    "the implication of our fitting and the possible constraints are discussed in the next section .     to the g-2 of muon ( black ) and electron ( dashed red ) given in units of the corresponding standard deviation .",
    "the contribution to the muon g-2 is negative for @xmath44  gev ( dotted black ) .",
    "the pink regions quantify the deviation from the sm value of g-2 .",
    "the blue region denotes the measured value of the muon g-2 ( 1@xmath45 ) .",
    "the black dots on the muon curves indicate the best fits of the experimental value of g-2 , the 3.4@xmath45 excess .",
    "the factor @xmath24 is defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : defa].,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "as made clear by fig . [ fig1 ] , fitting the muon g-2 data requires a value of @xmath46 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath24 is @xmath47 for @xmath48  gev . above this threshold",
    "the required muon g-2 can be obtained for @xmath19 in two different ranges .",
    "for instance , if @xmath49 then the best fit masses are approximately @xmath50 and @xmath51  gev . however , in all these cases , the lowest mass resulting form the fitting is always constrained by the electron g-2 data . returning to our previous example , if @xmath49 then the electron g-2 deviates more than 3@xmath45 from its measured values if @xmath52  gev .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath24 comes from the unitary limit of @xmath53 , which gives @xmath54 .",
    "as anticipated , the searches for the direct production of the pseudoscalar mediator in @xmath15 resonance decays , followed by the muonic decay of the former , constrain the pseudoscalar - muon coupling to values much below the enhanced yukawa structure required for @xmath55s  @xcite . for example",
    "these experiments impose @xmath56 for @xmath57  gev and @xmath58 for @xmath59  gev  @xcite .",
    "it is consequently mandatory to modify the sm yukawa structure of the new couplings in order to fit the muon g-2 . in this regard ,",
    "the most elegant modification is assuming leptophilic cdm , where @xmath60 for quarks while @xmath61 for the sm leptons .",
    "hence , we recalculated the g-2 enhancement factors under the assumptions of our leptophilic scenario , confirming that the conclusions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] still hold .    with the leptophilic scenario in hand",
    ", we re - evaluate the constraints from lhc  @xcite and lep  @xcite .",
    "the monojet constraints from lhc are trivially avoided in the leptophilic model , because the pseudoscalar has no tree level coupling to quarks .",
    "if we assume @xmath62 and fix @xmath63 by the fitting of the gc annihilation signal , @xmath64  @xmath65  s@xmath66  @xcite , the constraint from @xmath67 results @xmath68 .",
    "the value is well above the current exclusion limits , e.g. , see fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "several papers based on the public fermi lat data claim that a spatially extended @xmath0-ray excess at gc favours dm annihilation into two possible channels : @xmath1 and @xmath69  @xcite . for leptophilic cdm",
    "the main annihilation channel is obviously @xmath1 , furthermore the @xmath70 and @xmath71 channels can be safely neglected as @xmath72 and @xmath73 . according to lacroix  et  al  @xcite",
    "the tau channel gives even a better fit once the secondary production of @xmath0-rays ( by inverse compton and bremsstrahlung ) is taken into account . in this study",
    "we adopt the best - fit values of ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath74  @xmath65  s@xmath66 and @xmath75  gev ( similar values are quoted in  @xcite ) .",
    "the leading factor 2 of the cross - section comes from the dirac fermion nature of @xmath5 compared to the majorana one in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the best - fit mass @xmath76 is highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by the vertical pink band .",
    "accordingly , the best - fit mass @xmath19 for the muon g-2 is shown by the horizontal pink region .",

    "the vertical gray regions represent the constraints from cmb  @xcite and dwarf galaxies  @xcite , with the associated arrows denoting the variation of the latter throughout the references .",
    "there is clearly a tension between the constraints and the @xmath0-ray signal from gc .",
    "however , we underline that the density profile of dm is ( both theoretically and experimentally ) poorly known at the very center of the galaxy . consequently , the present estimation of @xmath77 are hampered .",
    "we also remark that , in obtaining the results of fig .",

    ", the effects of electron - dm scattering could result in the signal observed by the dama / libra experiment  @xcite .",
