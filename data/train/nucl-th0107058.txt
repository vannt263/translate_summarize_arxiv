    "two main mechanisms for @xmath0 suppression observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite are the dissociation by the quark - gluon plasma @xcite and the absorption by comoving hadrons , mainly pions and rho mesons @xcite .",
    "the cross sections of @xmath0 absorption by hadrons are , unfortunately , not well determined . in the perturbative qcd approach @xcite , based on the dissociation of charmonium bound states by energetic gluons inside hadrons ,",
    "the dissociation cross section increases monotonously with the kinetic energy of hadrons and has a value of only about @xmath2 mb at 0.8 gev . on the other hand ,",
    "both the quark - interchange model @xcite based on the gluon - exchange potential and the meson - exchange model @xcite based on hadronic lagrangians give @xmath0 absorption cross sections by pion and rho meson which are more than an order of magnitude larger , i.e. , a few mb .",
    "a similar magnitude for the @xmath3 absorption cross section has also been obtained in the qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath0 absorption cross sections by pion and rho meson can not be directly measured , it is useful to find empirical information which can constrain their values .",
    "one such constraint is the @xmath0 absorption cross section by nucleon , as this process can be viewed as @xmath0 absorption by the virtual pion and rho meson cloud of the nucleon . from @xmath0 production in photo - nucleus reactions ,",
    "the cross section of @xmath0 absorption by nucleon can be extracted , and its magnitude has been found to be about 4 mb @xcite . the @xmath1 absorption cross section has also been extracted from proton - nucleus collisions at proton energies from 200 to 800 gev , and the empirical value is about 7 mb @xcite .    in the meson - exchange model of refs .",
    "@xcite , the interaction lagrangians between pseudoscalar and vector mesons are obtained from the su(4 ) invariant free lagrangian for pseudoscalar mesons by treating vector mesons as gauge particles .",
    "this then leads to not only pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar - vector - meson couplings but also three - vector - meson and four - point couplings . since the su(4 )",
    "symmetry is explicitly broken by hadron masses , empirical hadron masses are used in the lagrangian .",
    "furthermore , values for the coupling constants are taken either from empirical information if they are available or from theoretical models , such as the vector meson dominance model and the qcd sum rules .",
    "otherwise , they are determined by using relations derived from the su(4 ) symmetry . in this paper , we shall generalize this lagrangian to study the @xmath0 absorption cross section by nucleon and to see if its magnitude is consistent with that extracted from @xmath0 production in photo - nucleus and proton - nucleus reactions .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 absorption cross section by nucleon is studied using a gauged su(4 ) hadronic lagrangian but with empirical particle masses , which has been used previously to study the @xmath0 absorption cross section by pion and rho meson . including both two - body and three - body final states </S>",
    "<S> , we find that with a cutoff parameter of 1 gev at interaction vertices involving charm hadrons , the @xmath1 absorption is at most 5 mb and is consistent with that extracted from @xmath0 production from both photo - nuclear and proton - nucleus reactions .    </S>",
