    "we start by briefly reviewing markov processes on a finite state space @xcite .",
    "to better follow the line of arguments , it is helpful to consider a socio - physical analogy : the cycles may be interpreted as the lines of a mass transit system with the peculiarity that the lines are running one - way on closed loops .",
    "the fluxes are proportional to the total amount of passengers traveling from one station to another ; _ i.e. , _ from a state @xmath0 to a state @xmath1 of the markov process .",
    "the lines are represented in different colors in figure  [ fig : markov - graph ] .",
    "we imagine each passenger to carry a ( correspondingly colored ) ticket indicating the line he is currently using .",
    "passengers can change lines in the stations . to remain in a steady state",
    "this involves a random exchange of tickets between passengers at stations .",
    "we represent the process as a random walk on a graph @xmath3 with @xmath4 vertices @xmath5 , @xmath6 and directed edges @xmath7 .",
    "the vertices represent the states of the system , and are shown as gray circles displaying the vertex indices @xmath8 in figure  [ fig : markov - graph ] .",

    "this ensures existence and uniqueness of the normalized distribution obeying @xmath31    in the physics literature a steady state is called an equilibrium if it obeys _ detailed balance _ , _ i.e. , _ if the individual fluxes between any two vertices @xmath0 and @xmath1 cancel , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath32    detailed balance further implies a weaker symmetry that is sometimes called _ dynamical reversibility _",

    "we quantify the number of systems traversing each edge of @xmath42 by the weight @xmath44 .",
    "there can be several cycles along an edge @xmath45 and the flux @xmath46 quantifies the _ total _ number of systems traversing that edge per unit time . in the remainder of this section we work out how the steady - state fluxes can be represented by different cycles",
    "@xmath42 with positive weights @xmath47 assigned to each of them .",
    "to express the geometrical structure of the cycles we define the indicator ( or passage ) functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 as    @xmath50    [ eq : pi - defn ]    in the language of graph theory @xmath48 is the adjacency matrix of a cycle .",
    "the following identities hold :    @xmath51    where @xmath43 is the length of the cycle @xmath42 . with their help",
    "we formulate the ideas of the previous paragraph mathematically . as we show below",
    ", there is a set of cycles @xmath52 with non - negative flux densities @xmath53 such that @xmath54 for all pairs of vertices @xmath45 .    to obtain a decomposition we choose an arbitrary enumeration of all @xmath55 possible cycles @xmath56 , @xmath57 ,  , @xmath58 on @xmath59 .",
    "the ambiguity in choosing the order of this enumeration leads to different decompositions constructed by the following algorithm : + start the iteration for cycle @xmath56 with a flux field @xmath60 that contains the steady - state fluxes of the original system :    * initialization : @xmath61    successively subtract the fluxes along different cycles . in the @xmath62th step set @xmath63 to be the minimum of the values of the flux",
    "@xmath64 along the edges contained in @xmath65 .",
    "the new flux field in iteration @xmath66 is the current one with @xmath63 subtracted at the edges traversed by cycle @xmath65 :    * iteration : + @xmath67 + [ eq : algo - iterate ]    the algorithm terminates after all possible cycles have been considered :    * termination condition : + @xmath68    we show below that at this point all edge fluxes have been assigned to a cycle , and the remaining flux field is zero along all edges , @xmath69",
    "the algorithm and its proof were first mentioned by macqueen @xcite and later by kalpazidou @xcite .",
    "we briefly review their argument . to show existence of the decomposition we demonstrate that for every flux field satisfying the steady - state condition , ( [ eq : node - condition ] ) , the algorithm terminates with zero fluxes along all edges , ( [ eq : algo - terminate ] ) , and provides non - negative weights which fulfill the defining equation  ( [ eq : weight - defn ] ) .",
    "the algorithm always terminates in finite time because @xmath55 is finite .",
    "since the weight assigned to a cycle , ( [ eq : assigned - m ] ) , is the minimum of all @xmath70 among the edges of cycle @xmath65 , the new fluxes @xmath71 assigned by ( [ eq : assigned - phi ] ) remain non - negative .",
    "consequently , the steady - state weights @xmath72 are non - negative .",
    "we prove ( [ eq : algo - terminate ] ) by contradiction .",
    "suppose there is a flux @xmath73 . if this flux fulfills the node condition there is a cycle which could have been assigned a larger weight @xmath72 , contradicting ( [ eq : assigned - m ] ) .",
    "hence , the remaining fluxes obey @xmath74 in contrast , for every steady state the initial flux field ( [ eq : algo - initialize ] ) fulfills the node condition ( [ eq : node - condition ] ) . iterating the initial flux field we find @xmath75 where we used ( [ eq : geometry - identity ] ) in the last line . in contradiction to ( [ eq : algo - terminate - ic ] ) this holds for every @xmath76 , proving ( [ eq : algo - terminate ] ) .    by construction",
    "the cycle fluxes obtained in this way fulfill ( [ eq : weight - defn ] ) .",
    "we use ( [ eq : assigned - phi ] ) and a telescope sum argument to obtain @xmath77 where in the last equation we used the algorithm initialization ( [ eq : algo - initialize ] ) and ( [ eq : algo - terminate ] ) .",
    "kalpazidou pointed out @xcite that the maximal number of cycles needed is the betti number @xmath78 used in algebraic topology .",
    "this can also be seen directly from the algorithm .",
    "after all , in a worst - case scenario each non - trivial cycle reduces the flux along one edge . because the iterated flux - field always fulfills the node condition ( [ eq : node - condition ] ) the number of remaining edges at any vertex can never be exactly one . then",
    ", as the graph is connected , at some point in the algorithm , @xmath79 nontrivial weights @xmath80 have been assigned and the remaining flux field consists of @xmath81 nodes forming a cycle which will be assigned the last non - trivial weight .",
    "a minimal number of cycles with non - vanishing weights can not be stated in general .",
    "however , symmetries present in the system that lead to the same fluxes at many edges may decrease this number as in the example below .",
    "the betti number @xmath82 can also be related to the number of cycles used in snt @xcite . in the latter theory ,",
    "@xmath83 undirected edges yield a set of @xmath84 fundamental cycles .",
    "if the system exhibits only unidirectional edges , @xmath85 . in the other limiting case dynamical reversibility holds and @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath83 additional numbers can be thought of as the detailed balance , _",
    "i.e. , _ diffusive , part of the @xmath83 bidirectional transitions .",
    "further , one can ( by using the freedom of choice in the enumeration ) specify a set of disjoint cycles to be part of the decomposition .",
    "a possible choice is to include the set of @xmath87-cycles ( of which there are @xmath83 in a dynamically reversible system ) .",
    "the result is a splitting of the fluxes in a detailed - balance part ( the set represented by the @xmath87-cycles ) , and the remaining current part .",
    "this resembles the approach in @xcite , but is conceptionally different because the decomposition here does not discard the information stored in the @xmath87-cycles .",
    "the set of weights @xmath88 can be interpreted as a mapping that transforms the original graph @xmath3 into a new one @xmath89 , see figure [ fig : transformed ] .",
    "for instance , the vertex @xmath90 represents the cycle @xmath42 in @xmath59 with the non - zero weight @xmath44 as identified by the algorithm . a directed edge @xmath91 indicates that two cycles share at least one vertex of @xmath59 , _ i.e. , _ one state of the original system .",
    "each edge @xmath92 of the transformed graph is associated with a transition rate @xmath93 . in the analogy of the mass transit system",
    "@xmath94 characterizes the number of passengers changing from line @xmath42 to line @xmath95 in the stationary system .",
    "we shall call the operation @xmath96 the _ cycle transform_. by virtue of ( [ eq : weight - defn ] ) the steady - state fluxes can be calculated from @xmath97 and @xmath98 . if the steady - state distribution @xmath99 is known , the full markovian dynamics on the original state space can be reconstructed . in terms of cycles ,",
    "the @xmath99 can be interpreted as loops associated with each vertex in @xmath59 ( _ cf . _",
    "the discussion of the discrete case below ) .    to find the rate constants",
    "@xmath93 we realize that in the steady state at each vertex @xmath5 ( _ i.e. , _ station , in the socio - physical picture ) a constant number of passengers arrives per unit time .",
    "this number is proportional to the overall influx @xmath100 . the passengers carry tickets indicating which line they are running on . upon arrival at the station",
    ", a passenger enters his ticket into a ticket machine that provides him with a new one . the probability to draw a ticket for line @xmath95",
    "is given by ratio of the weight of line @xmath95 to the weights of all lines serving station @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath101 the total flux @xmath102 from line @xmath42 to line @xmath95 is obtained by summing the local exchange flux @xmath103 over all mutual stations where @xmath104 @xmath105 a remarkable feature of this new formulation is that the cycle - space fluxes fulfill detailed balance ( @xmath106 ) . in the steady state",
    "this is a microscopically balanced ticket exchange .",
    "it means , that on average , passengers arriving at a station just exchange tickets with other passengers , and board the line for which their new ticket holds .    because of detailed balance in @xmath107 we can proceed along the line indicated by ( [ eq : potential - db ] ) . replacing @xmath108 by @xmath93 ,",
    "one obtains a potential @xmath109 , such that the occupation numbers @xmath44 are given by boltzmann weights , @xmath110 here the partition function @xmath111 includes the average cycle period @xmath112 .",
    "after all , the weights @xmath80 are not probabilities . according to equations  ( [ eq : transition - matrix ] ) ,",
    "( [ eq : flux - defn ] ) and ( [ eq : weight - defn ] ) they rather fulfill @xmath113 in summary , the potential @xmath109 is obtained from the ness fluxes @xmath114 by determining the population density @xmath44 of the cycles , followed by equations  ( [ eq : bi - defn ] ) , ( [ eq : transformed - flux ] ) and finally ( [ eq : potential - db ] ) .",
    "though our approach does not require knowledge of the invariant measure @xmath115 , the steady - state fluxes @xmath114 have to be known . from an analytical point of view",
    "this requires the full solution of the mathematical problem .",
    "however , in experiments fluxes might be easier accessible than probabilities .",
    "for every well - defined mapping @xmath116 from the set of cycles to the real numbers we define the cycle average @xmath117 for instance , for the characteristic functions @xmath48 we have @xmath118 by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : weight - defn ] , [ eq : cycle - average ] ) . on the other hand , @xmath119 , because the edge fluxes are not normalized weights .",
    "now let us consider cycle - space observables related to physical quantities .",
    "consider some matrix @xmath120 .",
    "we can interpret this quantity as the change of some physical observable due to the transitions between different states .",
    "we define @xmath121 as the average flux of quantity @xmath122 at time @xmath17 .",
    "the last equivalence is the definition of the average as the two - point probability - density function ( propagator ) at time @xmath17 . for antisymmetric",
    "@xmath122 one has @xmath123 .    to connect this with the cycle transform we define an observable @xmath124 which is the integrated contribution of @xmath122 along cycle @xmath42 .",
    "with the linearity of the averages @xmath125    .the six possible configurations for the tasep example .",
    "the corresponding network of states is shown in figure  [ fig : tasep - example ] .",
    "transitions @xmath126 and @xmath127 involve a particle leaving at the right site and entering at the left site . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this section we introduce an analogy relating markov processes , thermodynamics and electrical circuits .",
    "different electric analogies have been presented in the literature that are suitable for different purposes ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hill also noticed the connection of the logarithmic ratios of fluxes and transition rates with differences of free energies @xcite .",
    "the appropriate analogies are summarized in table [ tab : analogies ] . in this analogy",
    "the quantities defined above have the properties of their electrical counterparts : + @xmath83 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are asymmetric and the resistance @xmath131 is symmetric and positive .",
    "the definition of the fluxes , ( [ eq : flux - defn ] ) , obeys kirchhoff s equation @xcite , @xmath132 which states that if no current is flowing between two nodes with a battery - like element connecting them , a voltage difference @xmath83 is created .",
    "this voltage is the negative of the electromotance @xmath130 of the battery .",
    "however , if a current is running over a resistor @xmath131 , it obeys an ohmic law and the voltage drops by @xmath133 .",
    "kirchhoff s current law ( `` node rule '' ) amounts to ( [ eq : node - condition ] ) .",
    "kirchhoff s voltage law ( `` mesh rule '' ) states that integrating the voltage differences around a closed cycle is zero .",
    "this also holds in our analogy .",
    "it is the basis for the identification of @xmath83 with a total differential in thermodynamics .",
    "finally , the quantity @xmath134 describes the change of the system s gibbs entropy @xmath135 as the systems undergoes its dynamics , @xmath136 it vanishes in the steady state , and can be related to the irreversible entropy production @xmath137 by defining an entropy flux to the medium @xcite @xmath138 one then finds @xmath139 . introducing thermodynamic analogues one obtains @xmath140 such that",
    "hence , the definitions of table [ tab : analogies ] are consistent with the definitions made earlier , and @xmath141 .",
    "the analogy is not perfect , however .",
    "consider a simple cycle with the same current flowing through all nodes .",
    "then the potential difference between two non - adjacent nodes @xmath0 and @xmath1 can not be obtained from an effective resistance ( or electromotance ) which is the sum of the individual resistances ( or electromotances ) of the edges connecting @xmath0 to @xmath1 as it would be the case in an electrical network .",
    "if time is measured in discrete units @xmath142 one obtains a markov chain . in that case one",
    "has transition probabilities @xmath143 rather than transition rates @xmath108 . instead of a waiting time @xmath11 one",
    "has a staying probability @xmath144 .",
    "the transition matrix is @xmath145 and the evolution of the probability distribution @xmath19 obeys @xmath146 with the normalization for the transition probabilities @xmath147 and defining discrete time fluxes ( _ i.e. , _ joint probabilities ) @xmath148 one can rewrite ( [ eq : discrete - evolution ] ) into a master equation @xmath149 the steady - state condition is formally identical to ( [ eq : node - condition ] ) .",
    "therefore , all relations for the cycle representation also hold in the discrete case .",
    "+ further , the analogies presented in table [ tab : analogies ] hold if one substitutes the transition rates @xmath108 for the jump probabilities @xmath10 . still , there is a subtle difference we would like to point out : + the cycle transform introduced above only uses fluxes @xmath46 with @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , the number of variables to be specified is @xmath151 . in the discrete case ,",
    "it is straightforward to include the disjoint _ loop fluxes _ @xmath152 into the cycle transform by specifying @xmath81 additional variables .",
    "one can then uniquely reconstruct the transition matrix @xmath129 and the steady state probabilities @xmath115 from the fluxes by using ( [ eq : discrete - evolution ] ) and the definition of the fluxes .",
    "as in the continuous - time case , to reconstruct the full steady state one has to specify @xmath81 additional variables that do not directly influence the cycle transform algorithm .",
