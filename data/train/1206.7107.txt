    "light beams carrying orbital angular momentum ( oam )  @xcite , which is distinct from spin ( or polarization ) angular momentum , have become important subjects for theoretical and experimental investigation over the past two decades , and have been studied in the context of applications as diverse as angular momentum transfer to trapped particles  @xcite , quantum communication  @xcite , and sensing  @xcite .",
    "the oam is directly related to the azimuthal phase of the mode , independent of the axis about which the phase angle is defined  @xcite .",
    "photons exhibiting orbital angular momentum are also referred to as twisted photons @xcite .",
    "a collimated coherent beam of such photons is called an optical vortex  @xcite , a twisted beam  @xcite , or a helical laser beam  @xcite .",
    "the interaction of beams carrying oam with matter has become a subject of considerable interest  @xcite .    in the paraxial approximation , cylindrically",
    "symmetric light beams carrying oam may be described by laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) modes , which are a natural generalization of the pure gaussian beam without oam .",

    "a modified gouy phase appears for an lg beam with winding number @xmath3 and radial node number @xmath11 , @xmath12=",

    "we will show that the gouy phase shift in an lg beam has a transverse radial dependence .",
    "the gouy effect is maximal along the axis of propagation , conventionally taken to be the @xmath5 axis , and decreases radially outwards . at a specific value of the radial coordinate @xmath15 , the gouy phase change vanishes , and it becomes negative for higher values of @xmath15 .",
    "we shall call this critical value of @xmath15 the _ gouy radius _ and label it as @xmath0 .    in what follows",
    "we shall establish that : ( 1 ) in the focal plane of a pure gaussian beam , the gouy radius @xmath0 equals the beam waist @xmath16 . ( 2 ) in the focal plane of an lg beam , the gouy radius @xmath0 becomes @xmath17 , and is proportional to the rms radius of the beam , which also grows as @xmath1 .",

( 4 ) the gouy radius serves as a natural physical boundary for the photon beam , delimiting the `` allowed '' zone from a `` forbidden '' zone . ( 5 ) the gouy radius is helpful in understanding the rotation of the poynting vector in a twisted photon beam .",
    "a beam of photons propagating in the @xmath5 direction prepared with linear momentum @xmath20 , orbital angular momentum @xmath3 , and radial node number @xmath2 may be represented by the vector potential  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a unit vector in the @xmath23 direction and @xcite : @xmath24^{|\\ell|}\\exp\\left [ -\\frac{r^2}{w^2(z ) } \\right ] l_{p}^{|\\ell|}\\left ( \\frac{2r^2}{w^2(z ) } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\exp[i\\ell\\phi]\\,\\exp\\left [ \\frac{ik_0r^2z}{2(z^2+z_r^2 ) } \\right ] \\exp\\left [ -i(2p + |\\ell| + 1)\\tan^{-1 } \\left ( \\frac{z}{z_r } \\right ) \\right ] \\label{lg}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 are the generalized laguerre polynomials , and the rayleigh range @xmath6 will be defined below . for a pure gaussian beam ( @xmath26 ) ,",

    "a general lg beam , however , has an additional radial structure , including @xmath2 radial nodes .",
    "yet the parameter @xmath18 that appears in eq .",
    "( [ lg ] ) is still conventionally referred to as the width or radius of the lg beam  @xcite . but",
    "this is misleading for nonzero @xmath3 or @xmath2 , as we shall demonstrate below .    at the beam waist of a gaussian beam , where the radius is @xmath16 ,",

    "@xmath31 is also the area of the aperture from which the gaussian beam emerges .",
    "a quantity of importance for laser beams is the rayleigh range @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the wavelength of the beam ( ref .",

    "so an important relationship exists between the beam waist radius @xmath16 , the rayleigh range @xmath6 and the wavelength @xmath33 of a gaussian beam @xcite : @xmath34 equation  [ gauss ] may be used as an alternative definition of the rayleigh range for a gaussian beam .",

    "because of the divergence of the gaussian beam as it propagates away from the beam waist at @xmath36 , the wavefront is convex rather than planar , as illustrated in fig .  [ figbeam ]",
    ". so the longitudinal wave vector component @xmath37 is smallest along the @xmath5 axis ( where the gouy effect is strongest and the phase advances most slowly ) and increases with the distance from this axis . of course",
    ", for a perfectly collimated beam with @xmath38 , the wave front would be planar , and @xmath37 would be everywhere a constant equal to @xmath20 .",
    "but for a gaussian beam @xmath37 is not constant across the transverse profile .",
    "one might expect that @xmath20 would equal the value of @xmath37 at the center of the beam , on the @xmath5 axis .",
    "but this is not the case . because of the gouy effect",
    ", the value of @xmath37 on the @xmath5 axis is necessarily smaller than the wave number @xmath20 which would correspond to a plane wave front .    in what follows",
    "we shall examine the gaussian beam at its waist , at @xmath36 , and show that it is precisely on the circumference of the beam waist , at @xmath39 , that @xmath40 , and that @xmath37 increases monotonically with @xmath15 .    the normalized field pattern for a gaussian beam is given by setting @xmath26 in the general expression of eq .  ( [ lg ] ) for lg beams : @xmath41}{w(z ) } \\exp \\left[-\\frac{r^2 } { w^2(z ) } + \\frac{ik_0r^2z}{2(z^2+z_r^2)}\\right]\\ , , \\label{gaussianwaist}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 .",
    "now @xmath37 can be evaluated as a function of the radial distance @xmath15 at the beam waist @xmath36 , by obtaining the derivative @xmath43 .",
    "to first order in @xmath5 , @xmath44 , and from eq .",
    "( [ waist1 ] ) @xmath45 , so @xmath46 it is evident that @xmath40 when @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the photon wavelength .",
    "clearly , the gouy radius at @xmath36 is @xmath49 so we have established the important result that for a gaussian wave at its waist or focus , the gouy radius is identical with the beam waist radius @xmath16 .",
    "similarly for the general lg beam ( eq .  ( [ lg ] ) ) , we have @xmath50 this yields the gouy radius @xmath51",
    "the amplitude of the lg mode is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "this function oscillates in a range @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and decays exponentially outside this range  @xcite .",
    "we then have @xmath56 and @xmath57 thus for a pure gaussian wave , with @xmath26 , @xmath58 .",
    "notably , we find that at the beam waist @xmath36 , the rms beam radius is @xmath59 times the gouy radius computed in eq .",
    "( [ waist2 ] ) , for all values of @xmath2 and @xmath60 .    clearly , @xmath61 is not the same as the radial distance of maximum intensity @xmath62 which has the value ( for @xmath63 ) @xcite @xmath64 the radius of maximum intensity becomes zero for a pure gaussian wave ( @xmath65 ) , but the expected or rms value of @xmath15 does not vanish for any realistic distribution . for large values of @xmath3 at fixed @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath62 approaches @xmath61 .",
    "we shall now tackle the more general problem of finding the beam width of a twisted photon beam for arbitrary values of @xmath5 , not just at the beam waist or focus .",
    "a note of caution is in order , because eq .  ( [ lg ] ) is a solution to the maxwell equations only in the paraxial approximation  @xcite .",
    "so for a divergent beam the equation is physically meaningful only for values of @xmath5 sufficiently small in relation to the rayleigh range .",
    "we will write eq .",
    "( [ lg ] ) in compact form as @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are real . so using eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) we may write @xmath69 as before , we will obtain the wave vector or momentum component @xmath37 , this time as a function of both @xmath15 and @xmath5 : @xmath70 the photon momentum is the sum of an imaginary and a real term .",
    "the former corresponds to an amplitude change , and the latter to a phase change  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the phase change , so @xmath71 using the definition of the gouy radius @xmath72 as the value of @xmath15 for which this change in phase becomes zero , we have @xmath73 this expression reduces to eq .",
    "( [ waist2 ] ) as @xmath74 .",
    "the gouy radius also diverges as @xmath75 .",
    "but as stated earlier , this latter case is not physical , as the paraxial approximation of eq .",
    "( [ lg ] ) breaks down for large values of @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath76 we may simplify the result as @xmath77",
    "the linear momentum of a gaussian wave photon differs from the corresponding momentum of a plane wave photon because of the gouy phase shift  @xcite , as is evident from eq .",
    "( [ zmomentum ] ) .",
    "we will now calculate the linear momentum of a laguerre gaussian photon .",
    "we first find the average momentum density integrated over the beam waist , i.e. , over the @xmath36 focal plane . from eq .",
    "( [ zmomentum ] ) we obtain @xmath78 and using eq .",
    "( [ rsquared ] ) , we have @xmath79 for a pure gaussian beam , this reduces to @xmath80 . for a plane wave ,",
    "for which @xmath81 , the photon momentum reduces to @xmath20 .    to obtain the average momentum density at arbitrary @xmath5 , we use eq .",
    "( [ kzaway ] ) and average over a plane normal to the @xmath5 axis ( the propagation direction ) : @xmath82    we see that the result is @xmath5-independent , expressing the conservation of photon momentum along the direction of propagation .",
    "the ( longitudinal ) gouy effect has been explained as a result of the transverse confinement or restriction of the photon beam  @xcite .",
    "this restriction leads to the generation of transverse photon momentum or wave vector components , so that  @xcite @xmath83 where it is to be noted that @xmath84 . comparing with eq .",
    "( [ kzarb ] ) we obtain @xmath85 where the average is performed over a plane of constant @xmath5 , or , using the cylindrical symmetry of the beam , @xmath86 these equations express the position - momentum uncertainty in the transverse direction .    now if we consider averaging over @xmath87 only in eq .",
    "( [ transverse ] ) , at fixed @xmath5 and @xmath15 , we see that within the gouy radius the transverse wave numbers @xmath88 and @xmath89 are real , but beyond this radius @xmath88 and @xmath89 become imaginary .",
    "imaginary wave numbers imply amplitude damping .",
    "the situation is analogous to a particle confined by a finite potential wall .",
    "there is a finite probability of penetration within the potential wall , and the probability drops off rapidly within this `` forbidden '' zone .",
    "thus the gouy radius provides a more satisfactory `` physical '' boundary for the photon beam than the function @xmath18 or the related radius of maximum intensity or the rms radius .    we shall now offer a correction to an important result that was derived for the rotation of the poynting vector in the course of the propagation of a laguerre gaussian beam @xcite .",
    "the authors have obtained an expression for the winding of the poynting vector around the axis of propagation of the photon beam .",
    "taking the poynting vector to be concentrated at the radius of maximum field they showed that this poynting vector undergoes a rotation of @xmath90 when propagating from the beam waist to the far field , and that the rotation is independent of the value of @xmath3 .",
    "but a more accurate calculation shows that the poynting vector does indeed circulate as a corkscrew and that the rotation is dependent on the value of @xmath3 .",
    "the poynting vector @xmath91 of an lg beam is obtained by taking the gradient of @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ lg ] ) : @xmath93 \\,\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is a function of @xmath15 and @xmath5 .",
    "( the expression given in ref .",
    "@xcite is missing a square and a minus sign . ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , the second and third terms inside the parentheses are assumed to be small and neglected .",
    "but for @xmath15 of order of the beam width , @xmath95 ( eq .  ( [ gauss ] ) ) , these terms contribute to the poynting vector magnitude @xmath96 at the same order as the @xmath97 term .",
    "what is clear is that dropping these two terms is equivalent to setting their sum equal to zero , which is valid but _ only _ at the gouy radius @xmath0 .",
    "so in the expression given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the rate of azimuthal rotation , @xmath98 @xmath15 is not an arbitrary radius but precisely the gouy radius @xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore problematic to assign to @xmath15 the value of the radius of maximum field intensity  @xcite or any radius other than the gouy radius .",
