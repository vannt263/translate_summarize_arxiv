    "the three - body recombination rate of ultracold atoms is an observable that displays the discrete - scale invariance of efimov systems : it is proportional to @xmath8 times a function that is log - periodic in @xmath1 @xcite .",

    "in particular , the impact of a finite effective range on the scattering - length dependence of efimov physics has been discussed in two recent papers  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to those works , here we include the effect of a finite effective range perturbatively and analyze the consequences for universal predictions in the three - body sector .",
    "we do this by setting up a perturbation theory around the unitary limit , and thus organize the corrections that manifest the differences between different large  scattering - length systems . these are effects beyond universality , and their inclusion allows us to extend the reach of efimov s ideas .",
    "the small parameters in this effective field theory ( eft ) expansion are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the momentum scale of the problem under consideration , and is @xmath21 for the recombination processes that are our concern here .",

    "the main result of our eft analysis at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) is that , if ( and only if ) scattering - length - dependent observables are considered , one such additional three - body parameter must be included in the calculation in order to guarantee the accuracy of the eft s predictions . to demonstrate the implications and limitations of this result",

    "( [ bhvk ] )  @xcite .",
    "the need for a three - body contact interaction at leading order implies that  at fixed @xmath1all observables in the three - body sector can be described by one - parameter correlations .",
    "for example , at fixed scattering length , particle - dimer scattering is correlated with the three - body binding energy .",
    "mapping out such a correlation corresponds to varying @xmath4 , or @xmath44 , keeping @xmath30 fixed .",
    "one can , however , also vary the two - body contact interaction and thus change @xmath1 , keeping the three - body counterterm fixed .",
    "this is what is expected to happen in atomic systems close to a feshbach resonance .",
    "there , a small variation in the magnetic field changes the scattering length dramatically , but is not expected to affect the short - distance physics that determines the value of @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath44 ( and hence @xmath4 ) does not change as @xmath1 is varied we have straightforward relations between the scattering lengths at which certain features in atomic recombination are observed .",
    "for example , the scattering length @xmath55 at which the trimer binding energy crosses the atom - dimer threshold is related to the binding momentum of the corresponding trimer at unitarity by @xmath56  @xcite .",
    "such relations can be listed for all relevant quantities and then lead to results such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) .",
    "these equations will , however , be modified in presence of a finite effective range . in the next section we consider these effects .",
    "to include higher - order corrections we follow and extend hammer & mehen s analysis  @xcite and include the operator associated with the two - body effective range , @xmath24 , perturbatively in the calculation of observables .",

    "[ fig : diagrams ] then corresponds to a single insertion of the propagator ( [ eq : d1 ] ) in the three - body system .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the corresponding integral displays a divergence that has to be canceled with an energy - independent three - body force @xmath60 .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) into the integral in the first line of this expression makes it clear that the term @xmath62 on the second line has to absorb two independent divergence structures , one of which is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "therefore we must write @xmath64 considering only fixed scattering length does not introduce an additional three - body parameter , since the total @xmath60 is fixed by the renormalization condition that the nlo amplitude has zero effect on the observable used for renormalization at leading order . however , if we desire predictions at nlo for observables as a function of @xmath1 we need to know the relative sizes of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the existence of such an @xmath1-dependent three - body force can be understood by considering the lagrangian shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "this lagrangian is constructed by writing down all terms allowed by the symmetries of the system .",

    "( [ eq:5 ] ) must be augmented to : @xmath67    this exemplifies the benefit of any eft : _ all _ operator structures allowed by the underlying symmetries will contribute at an order in the small - parameter expansion that can be determined by careful analysis .",
    "it furthermore relates experiments with ultracold atoms to a problem encountered in the application of @xmath26pt to nuclear physics . in this description of low - energy nuclear processes using only baryonic and pionic degrees of freedom , the small scale analogous to @xmath63 is the pion mass @xmath68 , and operators proportional to powers of the pion mass are a mandatory part of expressions for low - energy nuclear observables .",
    "for example , at @xmath69 , the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath70 ) potential calculated in @xmath26pt can be written as @xmath71 + [ c_{t } + d_{t } m_\\pi^2 ] \\sigma_1 \\cdot \\sigma_2 + v_{ope } + v_{tpe}^{(2)}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is one - pion exchange and @xmath73 is the `` leading '' two - pion exchange contribution to the @xmath70 interaction .",
