    "recent developments in particle physics , especially experiments on large hadron collider , bring one closer and closer to the lowest energy scale when one can start to probe extra dimensions . despite the fact that by now only kaluza - klein theories are somehow tested ,",
    "it is just a matter of time before we will be able to test many more extradimensional theories with particle physics . in that regard alternative tests are more then welcommed and cosmology could be of use here .",
    "one of the simplest implementations of cosmology in this question is search for cosmological models which allow compactification .",
    "one of the first attempts to find an exact static solution with metric being a cross product of a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional manifold and a constant curvature `` inner space '' , also known as `` spontaneous compactification '' , were done in  @xcite , but with ( 3 + 1)-dimensional manifold being actually minkowski ( the generalization for a constant curvature lorentzian manifold was done in  @xcite ) . in the cosmological context it could be useful to consider friedman - robertson - walker metric for ( 3 + 1)-dimensional section ; this situation with constant - sized extra dimensions was considered in  @xcite .",
    "there it was explicitly demonstrated that to have more realistic model one needs to consider the dynamical evolution of the extra dimensional scale factor as well . in the context of exact solutions",
    "such an attempt was done in  @xcite where both ( 3 + 1)- and extra dimensional scale factors were exponential functions . solutions with exponentially increasing ( 3 + 1)-dimensional scale factor and exponentially shrinking extra dimensional scale factor were described .",
    "more recent analysis focuses on properties of black holes in gauss - bonnet  @xcite and lovelock  @xcite gravities , features of gravitational collapse in these theories  @xcite , general features of spherical - symmetric solutions  @xcite and many others . of recent attempts to build a successful compactification particularly relevant",
    "are @xcite where the dynamical compactification of ( 5 + 1 ) einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) model was considered , @xcite , with different metric _",
    "ansatz _ for scale factors corresponding to ( 3 + 1)- and extra dimensional parts , and @xcite where general ( e.g. without any _ ansatz _ ) scale factors and curved manifolds were considered .    in  @xcite the structure of the equations of motion for lovelock theories for various types of solutions has been studied .",
    "it was stressed that the lambda term in the action is actually not a cosmological constant as it does not give the curvature scale of a maximally symmetric manifold . in the same paper",
    "the equations of motion for compactification with both time dependent scale factors were written for arbitrary lovelock order in the special case that both factors are flat .",
    "the results of  @xcite were reanalyzed for the special case of 10 space - time dimensions in  @xcite . in  @xcite the existence of dynamical compactification solutions",
    "was studied with the use of hamiltonian formalism .",
    "usually when dealing with cosmological solutions in egb or more general lovelock gravity  @xcite one imposes a certain _ ansatz _ on the metric .",
    "two most used ( and so well - studied ) are power - law and exponential _",
    "ansatz_. the former of them could be linked to friedman ( or kasner ) stage while the latter  to inflation .",
    "power - law solutions were intensively studied some time ago  @xcite and recently  @xcite which leads to almost complete their description ( see also  @xcite for useful comments regarding physical branches of the solutions ) .",
    "exponential solutions , on the other hand , for some reason are less studied but due to their `` exponentiality '' could compactify extra dimensions much faster and more reliably . our first study of exponential solutions",
    "@xcite demonstrate their potential and so we studied exponential solutions in egb gravity full - scale .",
    "we described models with both variable  @xcite and constant  @xcite volume and developed general solution - building scheme for egb ; recently  @xcite this scheme was generalized for general lovelock gravity of any order and in any dimensions as well .",
    "in some sense this paper is a logical continuation of  @xcite  in there we found analytically exponential solutions in einstein - gauss - bonnet and cubic lovelock gravity and now we want to perform stability analysis of the solutions found .",
    "this is important since just finding analytical solutions often is not enough  if the solution found is unstable , it can not describe physical phenomena it is intended to describe . in our case it is compactification  indeed , despite the fact that in  @xcite we described all possible spatial splittings , special attention was paid to cases with three - dimensional isotropic subspace , which , being expanding while all remaining dimensions are contracting , give us good example of compactification scheme at work . in  @xcite",
    "we found a number of solutions with three - dimensional isotropic subspace  now it is time to check their stability to see how much of them are stable .    for stability analysis we use four cases  ( 4 + 1 ) , ( 5 + 1 ) , ( 6 + 1 ) and ( 7 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "the reason for this choice is quite simple  as we stated , we analyze the stability of the solutions found in  @xcite and they are found in these four different dimensions . and the reason for considering these four in first place is also simple  ( 4 + 1 ) and ( 5 + 1 ) are the lowest two dimensions where gauss - bonnet gravity plays a role while ( 6 + 1 ) and ( 7 + 1 ) are two lowest dimensions where cubic lovelock plays a role . so that we not only consider solutions in two lowest dimensions , but also compare them in ( 6 + 1 ) and ( 7 + 1 ) for egb and cubic lovelock cases to see the difference cubic lovelock term brings .",
    "the structure of the manuscript is as follows : first we consider gauss - bonnet case and study stability for ( 4 + 1)- , ( 5 + 1 ) , ( 6 + 1)- and ( 7 + 1)-dimensional cases consequently , followed by a brief conclusion on the considered cases . then we deal with solutions with cubic lovelock term in ( 6 + 1 ) and ( 7 + 1 ) dimensions , also followed by a brief conclusion .",
    "finally , we discuss our results , point out familiarities and differences between cases and build directions for further research .",
    "in this section we study stability of the gauss - bonnet exponential solutions found in  @xcite .",
    "we will separately consider cases with different number of spatial dimensions and briefly comment each case .",
    "as  @xcite were devoted to study of vacuum and @xmath0-term solutions only , the equations of motion are written in a way to fit only these two cases  with @xmath0-term as a source ; in that case vacuum solutions are obtained with @xmath1 .",
    "full einstein - gauss - bonnet system ( i.e. without exponential _ ansatz _ ) reads : @xmath2th dynamical and constraint equations    @xmath3    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is gauss - bonnet coupling and we put einstein - hilbert coupling to unity .",
    "we perturb full system ( [ full_1 ] ) around exact exponential solutions to find the regions of variables and parameters where they are stable . as we perturb solution as @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( since exact exponential solution has @xmath8 ) , and keeping in mind that equations of motion are first order , the criterium for stability would be    @xmath9    so we derive @xmath10 and find regions on variables and parameters space which satisfy ( [ crit_1 ] ) .",
    "according to  @xcite , ( 4 + 1)-dimensional case has solutions with three different spatial splittings : isotropic @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "first of them , isotropic , is the simplest one  with only one variable we easily get @xmath14 ( and the perturbed equations are subject to cyclic indices permutations ) so that the solution is stable as long as @xmath15 ; this is true for both vacuum and @xmath0-term solutions .",
    "second to consider , @xmath13 is `` symmetric '' in a way that interchanging @xmath16 and @xmath17 does not change equations of motion . solutions of the perturbed equations read    @xmath18    so that stability is reached as long as @xmath19 . remembering that @xmath20",
    ", we can find stability regions on the @xmath21 space  they read    @xmath22    and are presented in fig . [ fig1](a ) .",
    "plane for gauss - bonnet solutions . in ( a ) panel we presented typical behavior for @xmath23 spatial splitting .",
    "the situation in ( a ) panel exactly correspond to ( 4 + 1)-dimensional @xmath13 case ( see eq . ( [ 4p1_2.5 ] ) ) , but other cases with @xmath23 spatial splitting ",
    "@xmath24 case from ( 5 + 1 ) ( see ( [ 5p1_6 ] ) ) , @xmath25 case from ( 6 + 1 ) ( see ( [ 6p1_1 ] ) ) and @xmath26 case from ( 7 + 1 ) ( see ( [ 7p1_1 ] ) )  have similar behavior ",
    "they meet this picture up to a factor . in ( b )",
    "panel we have typical behavior for @xmath27 spatial splitting .",
    "again , exactly this figure corresponds to @xmath28 case from ( 6 + 1 ) dimensions ( see eq .",

    "@xmath31 could be eliminated from the resulting system of the perturbed equations , making the perturbation in that direction undefined . formally since perturbation is undefined",
    ", we can not call it `` unstable '' , but on the other hand it is definitely not stable either , which in a sense makes it in some sort of neutral balance . in a sense this is expected  indeed , since @xmath17 is unconstrained , one has all grounds to question physical validity of the solution , so it is just expected that the solution is not stable .",
    "to conclude , two out of three ( 4 + 1)-dimensional solutions have stability regions on the @xmath21 plane : isotropic solution is stable iff @xmath32 while @xmath33 solution is stable iff @xmath19 ; considering the solution for @xmath17 one can find stability regions on the @xmath21 space  they are presented in fig . [",

    "so that further we call these solutions `` unstable '' but only in a sense that we can not definitely call them `` stable '' .",

    "three classes of spatial splitting ",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath27 and @xmath121  appear to be stable in both ( 6 + 1 ) and ( 7 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "first of them depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a )  actual figure is for ( 6 + 1)-dimensional case but ( 7 + 1)-dimensional fits it up to a factor .",

    "[ fig2](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .",
    "two of these three cases have similar behavior of stability areas with changing @xmath16 : @xmath23 and @xmath121 cases in both ( 6 + 1 ) and ( 7 + 1 ) dimensions have growing area of @xmath32 and so shrinking area of @xmath64 stability with increasing of @xmath69 ( areas of @xmath32 and @xmath64 stabilities cover entire @xmath113 plane and do not overlap ) .",

    "stability condition for vacuum isotropic solutions are the same as for @xmath0-term ones  they are stable as long as @xmath32 . but from  @xcite one can clearly see that @xmath25 and @xmath28 in ( 6 + 1 ) dimensions as well as @xmath29 , @xmath79 and @xmath26 in ( 7 + 1 ) dimensions also admit vacuum solutions .",
    "their stability were not addressed due to high nonlinearity of the resulting equations .",
    "indeed , the equations are obtainned as in the gauss - bonnet case , from @xmath1 condition from the constraint equation . in the gauss - bonnet case it results in bi - qubic equation , which could be dealt with .",
    "but in the cubic lovelock case the constraint is reduced to bi - sextic equation which can not be solved analytically any longer .",
    "it still could be solved numerically but in that case we would not be able to draw any generalizations so we decided to put this case aside for a while  we are going to return to it in one of the following papers .",
    "as we noted in the introduction section , exponential solutions play important role among exact solutions in cosmology . in  @xcite we reported exact exponential solutions in gauss - bonnet and lovelock gravity and demonstrated that we found all possible solutions with varying volume .",
    "there appeared to be a number of different solutions and some of them could give rise to a successful compactification so additional investigation required to find out which of them are viable from different physical points of view .",
    "one of such tests to solutions is the stability check .",
    "so we perturb full gauss - bonnet ( or more general lovelock ) system around solution to see how perturbations behave . with several parameters ",
    "@xmath122 for gauss - bonnet and @xmath105 for solutions with cubic lovelock term  for solutions which admit stability we can plot corresponding areas of stability on the parameters space . for gauss - bonnet case with only two parameters we simply use 2d @xmath122 plane but in cubic lovelock case there are three parameters and use of 3d plot could obscure the structure of stability regions .",
    "so we fixed @xmath16 and plot regions in @xmath113 plane and put an additional plot which demonstrates the effect of changing @xmath16 on the separation curves .    both gauss - bonnet and the case with cubic lovelock term",
    "have two same features  first , isotropic case is always stable iff @xmath32 .",
    "this is true in any number if dimensions and with any order of highest lovelock correction taken into account  corresponding solution of the perturbed equation is @xmath123 with @xmath124 being number of spatial dimensions .",
    "the second feature is instability due to unconstrained exponent in the exponential solution . indeed , in  @xcite we reported a number of solutions with unconstrained one or more exponents , e.g. , @xmath125 .",
    "when one perturb such solution , the corresponding perturbation @xmath126 is excluded from the full perturbed system , leaving it unconstrained . we treat it as instability , as for stable solution we need damping perturbation and we can not say this about unconstrained one . again , formally we can not call them `` unstable '' for the reason above , they would be rather in `` neutral stability '' class , but since we can not call them `` stable '' either , we exclude them from stable solutions . so below we describe cases with nontrivial stability regions .",
    "it appears that in gauss - bonnet case there are two such cases  @xmath23 and @xmath27 spatial splittings .",
    "typical stability regions for the former of them is presented in fig . [ fig1](a ) and for the latter  in fig . [ fig1](b ) . by `` typical '' here",
    "we mean that in each particular dimension separation curves resemble this typical one up to a factor .",

    "( [ l3_7p1_1 ] ) ) could also be described by this figure .",

    "one can see that both of them have substantial differences between ( 6 + 1)- and ( 7 + 1)-dimensional cases .",
    "the last point to attend to is the variation of the stability regions with varying @xmath16 in cubic lovelock case .",
    "there we have familiarity between @xmath121 and @xmath23 cases  both of them have the entire @xmath113 plane covered but separated into two regions  with @xmath32 stability and @xmath64 stability regions . these regions ,",
    "as said , cover the entire @xmath113 plane and do not overlap . with increasing @xmath69",
    "the area of @xmath32 stability gradually increase while @xmath64 regions shrinks as presented in figs .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , ( d ) and [ fig4](d ) .",
    "in contrast to two previous cases the @xmath27 case has quite different behavior .",

    "are the solutions with three - dimensional isotropic subspace . in",
    "@xcite we reported a number of them , but current analysis demonstrate that not much of them are stable .",
    "in fact , in einstein - gauss - bonnet case we can call only @xmath27 spatial splitting as stable ( with @xmath127 ) ; the same splitting is stable for the case with cubic lovelock term .",
    "formally , in einstein - gauss - bonnet @xmath128-dimensional case has solution with @xmath79 spatial splitting and it is stable iff @xmath64 , but as we look for viable compactification scheme we want expanding three - dimensional subspace , not contracting , which makes this case inviable . unlike einstein - gauss - bonnet case , in the case with cubic lovelock term @xmath79 spatial splitting is quite stable , as a part of @xmath121 general case . so that among a number of reported solutions which could give rise to compactification only one solution in einstein - gauss - bonnet case ",
    "@xmath27  could be said to be stable .",
    "the same solution is stable in the cubic lovelock case as well ; additionally we have @xmath79 solution in @xmath128 dimensions .",
    "vacuum solutions are obtained from @xmath0-term ones with @xmath44 condition in the constraint which diminish the number of parameters by one . in the einstein - gauss - bonnet case with @xmath44 condition the constraint",
    "is reduced to bi - cubic equation and so this case is analyzed while in the cubic lovelock theory it is reduced to bi - sextic equation and generally we can not solve it analytically .",
    "so we presented analysis of the vacuum solutions stability in the einstein - gauss - bonnet case but omitted them in the cubic lovelock  we are going to return to this problem in the near future .    to conclude , presence of cubic lovelock term severely changes not only the abundance of the solutions ( see  @xcite ) , but also the situation with their stability .",
    "indeed , the same spatial splittings in ( 6 + 1 ) and ( 7 + 1 ) dimensions have quite different stability conditions in gauss - bonnet and case with cubic lovelock term taken into account . we can also conclude that we described truthfully gauss - bonnet case and have all grounds to generalize solutions found on any number of dimensions , while for cubic lovelock term case there are still differences between different number of dimensions ; sometimes these differences are quite severe , as in @xmath27 splitting case .",
    "so perhaps we need additional study of higher - dimensional cosmologies in cubic lovelock case to draw any generalized conclusions ."
