    "selective excitation of preselected target states making use of shaped femtosecond laser pulses is at the heart of coherent quantum control @xcite .",
    "closed - loop optimization strategies @xcite have proven enormously successful in controlling a huge variety of quantum systems , however studies on model systems employing defined pulse shapes are the key to better understand the underlying physical mechanisms and to further develop quantum control concepts and techniques .",
    "this applies in particular to _ strong - field _ quantum control @xcite characterized by non - perturbative interaction of a quantum system with intense shaped laser pulses .",
    "strong - field physical mechanisms involve  besides the interference of multiple excitation pathways  adiabatic and non - adiabatic time evolution accompanied by dynamic stark - shifts ( dsss ) in the order of hundreds of mev .",
    "the latter is responsible for modification of the atomic states or molecular potential surfaces @xcite such that new pathways become available and new target states  inaccessible in weak laser fields  open up .",
    "recent studies of strong - field control on model systems devoted to the analysis of the basic physical mechanisms revealed that the concept of selective population of dressed states ( spods ) @xcite provides a natural description of controlled dynamics in intense shaped laser fields .",
    "for example , it was shown that ultrafast switching among different target channels by phase discontinuities within the pulse @xcite , rapid adiabatic passage ( rap ) by chirped pulses @xcite and combinations thereof @xcite are realizations of this general concept .    chirped pulses are a well - established tool in quantum control because they usually serve as a prototype for shaped pulses with controllable envelope and time - varying instantaneous frequency .",
    "therefore , they have played a prominent role in the development of quantum control concepts and techniques and are still the `` workhorse '' to test novel strategies in quantum control .",
    "examples of quantum control with chirped pulses comprise studies of selective excitation and ionization of multi - level system in alkali atoms @xcite , control of molecular dynamics in diatomics and dyes @xcite , measurement of coherent transients @xcite and the development of adiabatic passage techniques @xcite .    in the present contribution",
    "we employ chirped ultrashort laser pulses resulting from phase modulation of the laser spectrum to study resonance enhanced multi - photon ionization ( rempi ) of a multi - level system in sodium atoms .",
    "we demonstrate experimentally , that different excitation pathways and , accordingly , different target channels can be addressed selectively by a single control parameter , i.e. the chirp .",
    "the nature of these pathways is unraveled by measurement of photoelectron angular distributions ( pads ) from velocity map imaging ( vmi ) @xcite , yielding detailed information on the origin of the released photoelectron wave packets .",
    "theoretical investigations of the light - atom interaction reveal an interplay of different physical mechanisms governing control .",

    "the @xmath76 crossing occurring near the laser pulse maximum  the population transfer from state @xmath7 to state @xmath1 is relatively efficient and only about half of the population is left in states @xmath7 and @xmath8 thereafter ; then only a part of this already reduced population is transferred to state @xmath2 at the subsequent `` bow - tie '' crossing @xmath78 . moreover , this crossing occurs at late times and hence state @xmath2 is not visible in the photoelectron spectrum .",
    "state @xmath0 remains unpopulated once again as it stays far off any resonance .",
    "we now turn our attention to the regimes of a moderately large chirp @xmath19 , where the photoelectron spectrum changes from a single - state feature to one displaying double features .      for a moderate negative chirp ( @xmath79 , fig .",
    "[ all](b ) ) an early crossing occurs between states @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath2 in the rising edge of the pulse , which leads to a partial population transfer from state @xmath7 to states @xmath8 and @xmath2 , because the laser intensity is not strong enough to enforce adiabatic evolution .",
    "the population in state @xmath2 is exposed to ionization for the rest of the pulse , whereas the population in state @xmath8 proceeds until the subsequent @xmath80 crossing where it is partially transferred to state @xmath1 .",
    "the leftover temporary flows into state @xmath0 , which starts to emerge in the photoelectron spectrum , and is finally driven back into state @xmath7 . in result , all states @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are visible in the photoelectron signal , which is an indication for the creation of a coherent superposition of these ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2dmap ] at about @xmath81  fs@xmath27 ) .      for moderate positive chirps ( @xmath82 , fig .",
    "[ all](d ) ) state @xmath7 first comes very close to state @xmath0 at times of the laser pulse maximum ; during this proximity the population undergoes rabi - type oscillations between states @xmath7 and @xmath0 and is exposed to ionization from state @xmath0 .",
    "the signature of state @xmath0 is clearly visible and indeed , this is the regime where this state indisputably dominates in the photoelectron signal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2dmap ] at 0.8  ev and @xmath83  fs@xmath27 ) .",
    "in other words , it is the dss induced by the two - photon transition @xmath11 , which makes the population of the far - off - resonant state @xmath0 possible @xcite .",
    "if this stark - shift were absent ( e.g. if the two - photon transition @xmath11 were instead a single - photon one in a gedanken scenario ) state @xmath0 would never receive sizeable population .",
    "as we proceed beyond the pulse maximum state @xmath7 crosses state @xmath1 and the population is partially transferred to the latter .",
    "hence state @xmath1 emerges in the photoelectron signal due to the ensuing ionization , whereas state @xmath2 is invisible in this regime because all population left flows into state @xmath8 .",
    "in this regime the laser pulse is unchirped , @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , the _ effective _ chirp is entirely due to ac stark - shift .",
    "the latter is symmetric to the pulse because it is induced by the same pulse .",
    "moreover , because state @xmath7 crosses states @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( fig .  [ all](c ) ) , sizeable population will visit these two states through the respective first crossings @xmath84 and @xmath76 . a second pair of crossings in the falling edge of the pulse will induce additional transitions @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the implication is that states @xmath0 and @xmath1 will contribute significantly to the photoelectron signal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2dmap ] around @xmath29 ) .",
    "state @xmath2 , on the other hand , remains well off resonance throughout and receives only a small population due to ( weak ) non - resonant interaction .",
    "its contribution to the photoelectron signal should be therefore more muted than these from states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "below we discuss the five excitation regimes in the dressed state ( adiabatic ) context .",
    "when adiabatic , which demands large couplings and low chirp rates for the avoided crossings in question , starting in state @xmath7 we end up in state @xmath2 for @xmath87 or in state @xmath1 for @xmath88 ( fig .",
    "[ all ] , middle frames ; in the latter case a fully non - adiabatic passage across state @xmath0 occurs , since the pulse intensity is negligible for the @xmath84 resonance ) . therefore , clearly from fig . [ all ] ,",
    "our system exhibits a somewhat adiabatic behavior for chirp @xmath19 away from the origin .",
    "as we get closer , the crossings shift towards the pulse wings , whereas the pulse gets narrower in time , which in combination results in breaking adiabaticity .",
    "the latter is further hindered by the increased dss , which effectively enhances the chirp rate .",
    "we expect adiabaticity to remain almost unaffected for large negative values of the chirp @xmath19 , since the chirp rate @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and to break down for large positive values , for it relies on the three - photon transition @xmath86 , which gets weaker , as the resonances relative to @xmath91 and @xmath80 further separate in time .",
    "larger peak intensities @xmath92 strengthen adiabaticity for the transition @xmath93 and make complete population transfer possible , as also indicated in @xcite , whereas for the transition @xmath86 due to the unfavorable influence of the increased dss we predict the contrary .",
    "in this contribution we presented a joint experimental and theoretical study on strong - field resonance enhanced multi - photon ionization ( rempi ) of sodium atoms using chirped femtosecond laser pulses .",
    "experimentally , photoelectron angular distributions ( pads ) have proven the essential tool to identify the different excitation and ionization pathways .",
    "we observed three distinct ionization pathways contributing to the measured pads .",
    "the predominant contribution with combined @xmath12 and @xmath13-symmetry is due to a 2 + 1 + 1 rempi processes involving the strongly driven two - photon transition @xmath37 , and subsequent ionization from the states @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "photoelectrons with combined @xmath13 and @xmath14-symmetry originated from 3 + 1 rempi via states @xmath3 and @xmath4 . a weak contribution with combined @xmath15 and @xmath16-symmetry close to the ionization threshold",
    "is attributed to the third channel , that is two - photon ionization of the non - resonant transiently populated state @xmath6 .",
    "selective population of the highly excited states @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 was achieved by controlling a single pulse parameter , i.e. the chirp parameter @xmath19 . in particular , we observed highly selective population of state @xmath2 using strongly down - chirped laser pulses . for",
    "strongly up - chirped laser pulses states @xmath1 and @xmath3 were populated with high efficiency and a dominant signal from state @xmath0 was obtained for moderately up - chirped laser pulses .",
    "moreover , in the intermediate chirp regions coherent superpositions of neighboring states have been excited .",
    "simulations based on numerical integration of the time - dependent schrdinger - equation for a neutral 20-state system are in agreement with our experimental findings . in addition , a five - state model was developed in order to provide insights into the physical mechanisms at play .",
    "our analysis of the time - dependent populations showed that by tuning the chirp parameter distinct physical mechanisms have been addressed , involving adiabatic and non - adiabatic time evolution along with dynamic stark - shifts ( dsss ) and ( multiple ) level crossings .",
    "it was pointed out that the occurrence of an uncommon `` bow - tie '' level crossing is responsible for the excitation of coherent superposition states as observed in the experiment .",
    "the strong dss of the two - photon transition @xmath94 turned out to be of particular significance for populating state @xmath0 being inaccessible in weak laser fields .",
    "our results highlight the importance of studying model systems experimentally and theoretically to better understand the physical mechanisms of strong - field coherent control .",
    "our findings demonstrate that , in general , in strong - field control multiple pathways involving different physical mechanisms are at play simultaneously .",
    "each @xmath15 state consists of @xmath95 and @xmath96 substates , coupled by @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively , to a relevant @xmath12 state . therefore initially our system comprises overall 10 states ( prior to eliminating state @xmath6 ) . to simplify our approach",
    "we perform a transformation to a dark - bright basis for each of the @xmath15 states and thus eliminate half of the @xmath15 substates as dark ( uncoupled ) states , and keep the rest , which become coupled by the root mean square of the relevant @xmath97 and @xmath98 and are the ones to be referred to as @xmath15 states throughout the theoretical part of the paper .",
    "the effective two - photon transition moment between states @xmath7 and @xmath8 is [ q12 ] q_12=- , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the dipole moments for the transitions @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "the effect of a quadratic phase modulation in frequency domain of the form @xmath103 is described in time domain by a modulated linearly polarized laser electric field @xmath104 given as @xcite @xmath105 where for the positive - frequency part we have e^+ ( t ) = e^-e^i_0 t e^i(a t^2- ) with & = & , + & = & , + & = & 1 + ( ) ^2 , + a&= & resulting in the time - dependent instantaneous laser frequency [ eqn : chirp ] ( t ) = _ 0 + 2 a t. here @xmath106 denotes the fwhm of the intensity @xmath107 of the unmodulated pulse , @xmath18 is the laser carrier frequency and @xmath19 is the chirp parameter to be varied .",
