    "comparing the dust depletion patterns of the 2175- absorbers with the galactic clouds can provide important clues on the general astrophysical characteristics of them .",
    "the dust depletion for the two absorbers in this work is very similar to that measured in cold clouds of mw , which are characterized by cold , dense and primarily molecular gas .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the observations ;  3 presents the analysis of uv extinction bumps ; in  4 we present the measurements of elemental column densities in the two absorption line systems ; in  5 we explore the dust depletion patterns ; discussions are presented in  6 ; future work and conclusions are given in  7 .",
    "the sdss spectra of these two quasars are remarkable with depressed flux around @xmath10  .",
    "they were initially uncovered by patrick b. hall , when he carried out a visual inspection of the sdss spectra of the dr1 quasars with @xmath11 ( schneider et al .",
    "2003 ) to identify unusual quasar subtypes ( i.e. primarily broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars , nitrogen - strong quasars and dust reddened quasars ) .",
    "the features were then interpreted as 2175- extinction bumps associated with two strong intervening mg  ii absorbers at @xmath121.4 in lines of sight toward the quasars by wang et al .",
    "the point - spread function magnitudes measured from the sdss images are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for j1459 + 0024 ; @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 for j0121 + 0027 , respectively .",
    "the sdss spectra cover @xmath23   with a spectral resolution @xmath24 ( stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we performed follow - up spectroscopic observations of the quasars at higher spectral resolution to explore the dust depletion in these two 2175- absorbers . the medium - resolution ( @xmath25 ) , medium signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath26 ) quasar spectra were obtained with the 10-m keck telescope using the echellette spectrographs and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al .",
    "the entire spectra cover the full optical range from 3900   to 1.1 @xmath27 m , recorded by a single 2k@xmath284k lincoln labs ccd with 15 @xmath27 m pixels .",
    "the quasars were observed on 20 december 2003 ( ut ) with total exposure times of 900s and 2700s for j1459 + 0024 and j0121 + 0027 under good conditions but variable seeing of approximately fwhm=@xmath29 .",
    "we implemented the 0.5@xmath30 slit for j1459 + 0024 and the 0.75@xmath30 slit for j0121 + 0027 which yields a fwhm resolution of 33 km / s and 44 km / s respectively . an additional 1800s exposure for j1459 + 0024 was obtained on 18 february 2004 ( ut ) .",
    "the data were reduced and calibrated using the esiredux software package ( v1.0 ) developed by jxp ( see prochaska et al .",
    "2003 for details ) .",
    "then the two reduced spectra of j1459 + 0024 were combined .",
    "the data were normalized by fitting a series of polynomials to absorption - free regions of the quasar spectrum .",
    "the metal absorption lines of interest are plotted in velocity space in figures 5 and 6 .",
    "jiang et al . ( 2010 ) used a parameterized extinction curve ( fm parameterization ; fitzpatrick & massa 1990 ) constituted by a linear component and a drude component to describe the optical / uv extinction curve in the rest frame of quasar absorber .",
    "the linear component is used to model the underlying extinction , while the drude component is used to model the possible 2175- extinction bump .",
    "the parameterized extinction curve is written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "and @xmath33 is a drude profile , which is expressed as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the peak position and fwhm of drude profile , respectively .",
    "our aim is to unveil the 2175- absorption feature associated with absorption line systems on quasar spectra .",
    "we do not try to derive the absolute extinction curve .",
    "our derived curve is a relative extinction curve without being normalized by e ( ) .",
    "we can not measure the conventional extinction parameters @xmath37 , e ( ) and @xmath38 from it .",
    "but all the features of 2175- absorption bump are preserved .",
    "the strength of bump is measured by the area of bump @xmath39 , which can be interpreted as rescaling the integrated apparent optical depth of bump absorption ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we fit the sdss spectra of j1459 + 0024 and j0121 + 0027 by reddening the sdss composite quasar spectrum ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ) with parameterized extinction curves at the redshifts @xmath41 for the former and @xmath42 for the later , respectively .",
    "the redshifts are those of the strongest component in the absorption line profiles , which are measured on our keck / esi spectra , for the two 2175- absorbers .",
    "since the 2175- extinction bump is a very broad feature , whose fwhm is usually greater than 300 ( fitzpatrick & massa 2007 ) , the small differences between these redshifts and the redshifts of the centroid of absorption line profiles could not affect the results of spectrum fitting in this work . to focus on fitting the continuum of quasar spectrum ,",
    "the regions with strong emission lines and known strong absorption lines are masked .",
    "several intervening ly@xmath7 absorption lines are present blueward of the ly@xmath7 emission lines on the spectrum of j1459 + 0024 with @xmath432.6 .",
    "we remove them iteratively by clipping the outliers beyond 4@xmath44 error .",
    "the results of spectrum fitting are listed in table 1 .",
    "the best models are overplotted with sdss data in figures 1a and 2a . to emphasize the requirement of a absorption bump on the extinction curve , we also overplot the reddened composite quasar spectrum by using the linear component of best model ( green lines in figures 1a and 2a ) only .",
    "the required bump of j1459 + 0024 is so broad that its wings exceed the wavelength coverage of sdss spectrum .",
    "thus , the entire observed spectrum of j1459 + 0024 is completely off from the green model in figure 1a .",
    "the intrinsic variation of quasar spectra can mimic an extinction bump in some cases ( pitman et al .",
    "we gauge the significance of the extinction bumps in this work with the simulation technique developed by jiang et al .",
    "the simulation technique begins with the selection of a control sample of sdss quasar spectra at a similar redshift to the quasar of interest .",
    "then we fit each of them by reddening the composite quasar spectrum with a parameterized extinction curve at redshift of the absorber of interest .",
    "the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the parameterized extinction curve are fixed to the best values fitting the 2175- extinction bump of interest .",
    "the distribution of bump strengths is expected to be a gaussian by assuming random fluctuation of continuum on each spectrum in the control sample .",
    "if the bump strength of the absorber is far away from this distribution , then the bump has statistical significance . for each quasar",
    ", we select the spectra in sdss dr7 database classified as quasars ( specclass = qso or hiz_qso ) with redshift in the range of @xmath45 and signal - to - noise ratio sn_i @xmath46 6 , as its control sample . the resultant control sample of j1459 + 0024",
    "is constituted by 1002 sdss quasars around @xmath47 .",
    "the resultant control sample of j0121 + 0027 is constituted by 2351 sdss quasars around @xmath48 .",
    "the extracted distributions of bump strengths are presented in figure 1c and 2c .",
    "both of the bumps in j1459 + 0024 and j0121 + 0027 are statistically significant at confidence level of @xmath49 .",
    "the width of bump strength distribution for j1459 + 0024 is much greater than that for j0121 + 0027 .",
    "that is because the bump on the spectrum of j1459 + 0024 ( @xmath50m@xmath51 ) is much broader than that of j0121 + 0027 ( @xmath52m@xmath51 ) . for the spectrum without a real extinction feature ,",
    "the fitted bump strength is an integration of random fluctuations over the wavelength range covered by the bump of interest . in principle",
    ", a longer integration makes the resultant distribution of bump strengths broader .",
    "therefore , a broad bump has to be stronger ( with larger bump area ) than a narrow one in order to be significantly distinguished from random fluctuations of quasar spectra . in theory ,",
    "the mean value of bump strength distribution should be zero .",
    "but , the mean value of the bump strength distribution is about 1.0 for j1459 + 0024 ( see figure 1c ) .",
    "the significant non - zero mean bump strength is mainly caused by the low quality of the sdss quasar composite spectrum in far uv band of its rest frame .",
    "there are only about 150 low ( or moderate ) observed quasar spectra being used to create the composite spectrum in far uv band ( vanden berk et al .",
    "thus , it is very likely that the composite quasar spectrum can not represent the average properties of quasar spectra in far uv band completely .",
    "we also perform continuum fitting by reddening the sdss composite spectrum with different types of average extinction curves , namely that from the smc , the lmc supershell ( lmc2 ) , the lmc ( gordon et al . 2003 ) and the mw ( fitzpatrick & massa 2007 ) .",
    "the 2175- extinction bump is absent in the smc extinction curve and it is strongest in the lmc and the mw extinction curves . the strength of bump in lmc2 extinction curve is medium .",
    "these extinction curves are given in the fm parameterization .",
    "the two free parameters in the continuum fitting are e ( ) and a normalization scale .",
    "the results of spectrum fitting are presented in table 2 .",
    "we show the models using different extinction curves for the two reddened quasar spectra in figure 3 .",
    "the spectrum of j0121 + 0027 can be fitted by the average lmc ( @xmath53 ) and the average mw ( @xmath54 ) extinction curve models .",
    "but the spectrum of j1459 + 0024 can not be fitted by any model ( @xmath55 in the best case ) .",
    "that is because the extinction bump on j1459 + 0027 is much broader ( @xmath56m@xmath51 ) than that of the average lmc ( @xmath57m@xmath51 ) extinction curve or the average mw ( @xmath58m@xmath51 ) extinction curve .",
    "we compare the two extracted 2175- absorption bumps at @xmath121.4 with the bumps observed in the mw ( see figure 4 ; fitzpatrick & massa ( 2007 ) ) .",
    "the peak position and strength of bumps are within the range of galactic values . however , the fwhm of bump in j1459 + 0024 is larger than the broadest galactic bump , which is measured in the line of sight toward the star hd29647 .",
    "the direct comparison of optical / uv extinction curves of j1459 + 0024 and hd29647 is plotted in figure 3c and the comparison of j0121 + 0027 and hd164816 ( the latter has a similar bump with the former ) is in figure 3d .",
    "since the extracted extinction curves for quasar absorbers are relative extinction curves , we can not measure the absolute visual extinction @xmath37 on them .",
    "we add an arbitrary normalization on the extracted curves while plotting them with galactic curves .",
    "the total number of absorption components are not fully resolved because of our limited resolution and the intrinsic line - blending . for the line of sight toward j0121",
    "+ 0027 , three mg  ii absorption systems are seen at @xmath591.3877 , 1.3888 , 1.3907 , which match the approximate redshift of 2175- absorption bump ( @xmath121.39 ; wang et al 2004 ) detected in the sdss spectrum .",
    "since the first two strong systems are only separated by @xmath8 140 km s@xmath51 ( corresponding to @xmath3=1.3888 ) , they are considered as two associated components in one absorption system at @xmath3=1.3888 in this work .",
    "the third one could be another component , but it is neglected in our analysis because it is too weak to affect the measurements . for the line of sight toward j1459 + 0024 ,",
    "one strong mg  ii absorption system is seen at @xmath3=1.3947 .",
    "we identified numerous absorption lines associated with the absorption system , consistent with the 2175- absorption bump feature redshift ( @xmath121.39 ) measured in the sdss spectrum .",
    "we carry out the apparent optical depth method ( aodm ; savage & sembach 1991 ) to measure the column densities of low ionization absorption lines in those two 2175- absorption systems . in general , the column densities",
    "are measured by integrating the optical depth over the velocity range of the spectra covering all of the absorption in the detected transitions .",
    "the uncertainties for detections are reported as 1@xmath44 errors .",
    "the upper limits are measured by integrating the optical depth over the same velocity range as an unsaturated line ( i.e. fe  ii@xmath602374 ) and are reported as 3@xmath44 statistical limits . for the saturated lines ,",
    "the column densities derived from the aodm are reported as lower limits .",
    "we also measured the column densities of transitions in red and blue components of the absorption system toward j0121 + 0027 separately .",
    "the boundary of these two components is chosen at the point of @xmath61 km s@xmath51 compared to redshift @xmath3=1.3888 ( the thin blue dot line in figure 6 ) .",
    "all ionic column densities are presented in table 3 .",
    "the column density measurements of ions from absorption lines only represent the elements in the gas phase . if one assumes that ionization corrections are small for what is expected to be a primarily neutral gas , the observed relative gas - phase abundances reflect the underlying nucleosynthetic abundance pattern modified by the differential depletion of the elements .",
    "frequently , the relative abundance , [ fe / zn]=log(n(fe)/n(zn))@xmath62log(n(fe)/n(zn))@xmath63 , is used to infer the dust depletion level , even when n(h  i ) is not obtainable , by assuming that zn , which is assumed to be nearly undepleted due to its low condensation temperature ( meyer & roth 1990 ; pettini et al .",
    "1994 ) , tracks the fe peak closely in nucleosynthesis .",
    "the detected transitions of zinc are zn  ii@xmath602026 and zn  ii@xmath602062 on our keck spectra .",
    "these two absorption lines are weakly blended with mg  i@xmath602026 and cr  ii@xmath602062 lines , respectively . since the oscillator strength of transition cr",
    "ii@xmath602062 is fairly weak and other transitions of cr  ii are only marginally detected in both of the absorption systems , we think the absorption line of zn  ii@xmath602062 is not contaminated by blending and take the column density of zinc measured on it to derive dust depletion patterns . for other species ,",
    "the weighted mean values are adopted if there are two or more transitions detected .",
    "the depletion patterns are listed in table 4 .",
    "we compare the dust depletion patterns in the two 2175- absorption systems with the depletion patterns observed in smc ism , lmc ism and cold galactic disk clouds ( welty et al .",
    "1997 ; welty et al .",
    "1999 ) in figure 7 .",
    "the dust depletion levels increase sequentially from smc , lmc to mw .",
    "it is clear that the depletion patterns of both absorption systems closely resemble that in cold galactic clouds , especially from the best measured [ fe / zn ] values .",
    "the strength of 2175- extinction bumps increases in the same manner of dust depletion from smc , lmc to mw .",
    "it is very likely that heavy dust depletion is required to give rise of a 2175- absorption .",
    "see more discussions in  6 .",
    "the depletion levels , [ fe / zn]@xmath1 and [ si / zn]@xmath2 , in both of absorbers are among the highest dust depletion ever measured for qal systems . the mean value of [ fe / zn]@xmath64 - 0.6 was measured by york et al .",

    "2007 ; vlt / uves data from noterdaeme et al . 2008 ) , in figure 8 .",
    "we ignore censored data in the sample when plotting the figure . to present the dust depletion of two 2175- absorbers in the same figure",
    ", we assume the column density of neutral hydrogen n(h",
    "i)=10@xmath66 cm@xmath51 in both of them .",
    "this assumption is arbitrary and is for drawing purpose only .",
    "dlas bearing h@xmath68 are marked with black filled circles .",
    "it is clear that dlas showing high dust depletion level , [ fe / x]@xmath69 - 0.4 , have a high h@xmath68 detection rate ( e.g. , ge & bechtold 1997 ; ge et al .",
    "2001 ; ledoux et al .",
    "2003 ; cui et al . 2005",
    "; noterdaeme et al . 2008 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume , therefore , that the gas in these two 2175- absorbers bears molecules .",
    "the dust depletion patterns ( [ x / zn ] ) in the smc ism is very similar to that measured in galactic halo clouds , while the depletion in the lmc ism is very similar to that in galactic warm disk clouds ( see table 4 ) .",
    "since the overall metallicity and dust - to - gas ratio are very different in smc , lmc and mw ( e.g. pei 1992 ; welty et al .",
    "1997 ) , the similarities probably indicate that dust depletion can hardly be dependent on these two physical parameters . in the mw , the most severe depletions are found in lines of sight with the largest mean densities and largest fraction of h@xmath68 ; the least severe depletions are observed for halo clouds and for high velocity clouds in the galactic disk ( e.g. jenkins , wallerstein and silk 1984 ; savage & sembach 1996 ; fitzpatrick 1996 ; trapero et al .",
    "1996 ; jenkins & wallerstein 1996 ; welty et al .",
    "such a dependence of dust depletion on environment probably has to do with the modification or destruction of dust grains by supernova shocks . in cold dense molecular clouds , large dust grains",
    "can form substantially by coagulation of finer grains .",
    "while in warmer environments , large grains are usually destroyed by energetic processes and some depleted elements return to the gas phase .",
    "the fact that the strength of 2175- extinction bumps becomes weaker with the decreasing dust depletion levels from mw , lmc to smc may indicate the destruction of 2175- absorption carriers happens simultaneously with the destruction of large grains .",
    "the large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules , which have strong @xmath70 absorption in the 20002500  region , are proposed to be the carrier of 2175- absorption ( li & draine 2001 ) .",
    "these large molecules can be easily destroyed by photon - thermo dissociation , coulomb explosion and/or x - ray destruction ( e.g. voit 1992 and reference therein ) .",
    "we search for the literatures and find 15 lines of sight in mw having both measurements of uv absorption bump and metal abundance available ( see table 5 ) .",
    "dust depletion is measured with the abundance ratio [ fe / h ] by assuming the underlying abundances are solar values .",
    "the measurements of galactic 2175- extinction bump are taken from fitzpatrick & massa ( 2007 ) .",
    "note that the area of bump defined in fm07 is different from that in this work .",
    "since the extinction curve has been normalized by e ( ) in fm07 , @xmath71=e()@xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the area defined in fm07 .",
    "we plot the relative bump strength ( @xmath74 ) versus [ fe / h ] in figure 9a .",
    "we calculate spearman s @xmath75 , a non - parametric measure of statistical dependence between two variables , for the relative strength of bump and [ fe / h ] .",
    "the resultant spearman s @xmath76 suggests a tentative anti - correlation between them with statistical confidence level of 90% .",
    "the fairly large scatter of bump strength could be caused by the varying size of pah molecules from one sightline to another .",
    "draine ( 2003 ) interpreted the observed variations in fwhm ( and small variations in peak position ) of galactic 2175- extinction bump profile would result from differences in the pah mix .",
    "this differences could also affect the oscillator strength per molecule and lead to the deviation of bump strengths .",
    "note that the two 2175- extinction bumps in this work have very different widths and strengths .    in figure 9c",
    ", we confirm the anti - correlation between f(h@xmath68 ) and [ fe / h ] ( spearman s @xmath77 ) and interpret it as simultaneous dissociation of molecular hydrogen with destruction of large dust grain .",
    "in addition , we find a tentative correlation between dust - to - gas ratio and [ fe / h ] with spearman s @xmath78 ( figure 9d ) .",
    "it is consistent with the grain destruction scenario . assuming a constant density and a sphere shape of dust grains , the total cross section of finer grains would be greater than the total cross section of large grains even if some materials of dust grains are evaporated during the destruction processes .",
    "we summarize the discussions as a molecule and large grain destruction scenario : 1 .",
    "molecules ( e.g. pah and h@xmath68 ) and large dust grains form substantially in cool and dense environment ; 2 .",
    "molecules and large grains would be destroyed simultaneously when the environment is heated ( e.g. heated by supernova shock waves ; irradiated by extreme uv photons ) ; 3 .",
    "the destruction of large dust grains releases some depleted elements into the gas phase ; the dissociation of h@xmath68 molecules decreases the f(h@xmath68 ) ; the dissociation of pah molecules diminishes the strength of 2175- absorption bump .",
    "in this work , we measure the dust depletion levels for the two 2175- absorbers . more observations in other wavelength bands will definitely help us to unveil the astrophysical conditions giving rise to 2175- absorption .",
    "for the two absorbers at @xmath0 in this work , the hst / cos spectrometer covers the important h  i and h@xmath68 transitions and can be used to determine the gas metallicity and f(h@xmath68 ) .",
    "we are planning to propose keck / hires observations to catch the c  i and other transitions blueward of the esi coverage to the atmospheric cutoff .",
    "the atomic carbon is an excellent tracer of cold , dense gas because of its low ionization potential ( below 1 ryd )",
    ". the ratios of c  i and c  ii transitions will provide us a powerful tool to probe the physical environment of the absorbers .    by using the parameterized extinction curve fitting technique , we are searching for more 2175- absorbers in sdss quasar spectra database .",
