    "the standard model is famously plagued by the need for a light scalar .",
    "one possible solution is that the higgs is a pseudo - goldstone @xcite .",
    "this idea has received renewed attention with little higgs theories @xcite and certain 5d warped models @xcite . in the former ,",
    "the higgs is protected by approximate , nonlinearly realized symmetries .",
    "the protection is redundant , such that breaking any individual symmetry will not generate a potential for the higgs .",
    "this collective symmetry breaking prevents the generation of a quadratically divergent higgs mass . in the 5d setup ,",
    "the higgs is the bulk @xmath2 zero mode whose holographic dual is a 4d pgb arising from strong cft dynamics .",
    "the protection of the higgs potentials in these models is usually ascribed to the need for brane - to - brane propagators .",
    "in fact , it is just collective symmetry breaking .",
    "we can see this by deconstructing the fifth dimension @xcite and integrating out the heavy modes .",
    "this gives us an extreme deconstruction where the theory now lives on a small number of sites .",
    "counting global and gauged symmetries shows that we have produced a little higgs theory . as an example , we will study the minimal composite higgs model ( mchm ) and its descendants @xcite .",
    "this warped model has an so(5 ) bulk gauge symmetry and so(4 ) and @xmath3gauge symmetries on the ir and uv branes , respectively . by deconstructing this theory and running to a low scale",
    ", we recover the symmetry structure of the custodial minimal moose ( cmm ) @xcite . in this",
    ", there are two sites , one with so(4 ) and one with @xmath3gauge symmetry .",
    "pgb higgs models such as these represent a large and interesting class of beyond the standard model theories . it becomes an important question to decide which realistic models look the most promising . comparing mchm to the cmm will help to answer whether we do better to place a given symmetry pattern on branes in 5d or on sites in 4d .",
    "both models are suppressing contributions to @xmath4 and nonoblique corrections .",
    "mchm has a known moderate tuning for @xmath5 of @xmath6 , but were this the only difficulty we may forgive it in exchange for a uv complete theory ( to the planck scale ) with natural flavor hierarchy .",
    "in fact , we will see that the @xmath5 parameter and changes to the @xmath7rate force the theory into a corner of parameter space where reproducing @xmath1 conflicts with getting acceptable precision electroweak observables .",
    "the cmm has no large contributions to @xmath5 and uses custodial su(2 ) to suppress @xmath4 and the nonobliques .",
    "thus , its parameter space is free of tunings and tensions .",
    "it can even have the scale of new physics as low as 375 gev .",
    "we also have the freedom to add eight new quarks without causing problems for @xmath5 or tuning in the higgs potential .",
    "doing so allows us to generate weak scale dark matter within the cmm as discussed in section [ sec : dmv ] .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section [ sec : appdecwarp ] , we will show how to deconstruct a 5d warped model and what one can learn from doing so .",
    "we will take an example from the higgs as a holographic pgb @xcite .",
    "in it , a possibly natural mechanism was proposed for generating an @xmath8 higgs quartic with no mass term .",
    "we show that the method used actually requires tuning .",
    "we also present an argument that in 5d what protects the higgs potential is just collective symmetry breaking .",
    "section [ sec : cmm ] is a review of the custodial minimal moose and a discussion of possible modifications to the third generation for protecting @xmath7or generating dark matter . in section [ sec : pewk ]",
    "we review the constraints on mchm and present a global analysis of the cmm .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] is the conclusion .",
    "the little higgs began as a deconstruction of higher dimensional theories @xcite .",
    "since deconstruction rewrites a theory into four dimensions , we can use it to clarify points which may seem obscure in the higher dimensional framework .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to systematically convert warped setups into little higgs models . by doing so",
    ", we can eliminate the large @xmath9 cft that forces tuning upon warped models by their contributions to the @xmath5 parameter .",
    "perturbativity is retained as our 4d field theory is now weakly coupled .",
    "as we shall see in this section , the viability of mchm as a pgb higgs theory without a hierarchy problem can be seen purely from its symmetry pattern .",
    "we can also decide how symmetry breakings in the uv will manifest themselves at low energies .      in this 5d model @xcite ,",
    "an @xmath10 gauge symmetry lives in the bulk .",
    "it is broken to @xmath11 by two separate su(3 ) triplet scalars , one on each brane .",
    "as the uv brane scalar gets a planck scale vev , the pgb higgs is almost entirely the ir field .",
    "this takes the form of excitations about the @xmath11 preserving vacuum configuration @xmath12 .",
    "we can thus parameterize the higgs field as follows :    @xmath13    where the @xmath14 are the su(3)/su(2 ) generators .",
    "there was a proposal to generate a tree - level quartic and vanishing mass term with a bulk scalar @xmath15 transforming as a @xmath16 of @xmath17 .. ] using deconstruction , we can see that such a potential is necessarily tuned .",
    "the higgs couples to @xmath15 with the interaction , @xmath18 . under @xmath19 , the @xmath15 will decompose as triplet , doublet , and singlet . by integrating out @xmath15 ,",
    "one induces a higgs potential . assuming an appropriate symmetry breaking pattern on the uv brane , the doublet and singlet contributions to the higgs mass",
    "can cancel , leaving just the quartic . by deconstructing the theory and introducing spurions , we can check if , in fact , there is a way to engineer such a cancellation .",
    "the collective symmetry breaking is exactly the same as in the simplest little higgs @xcite .",
    "we can express the theory at some scale @xmath20 with @xmath21 as the following moose ( the procedure for turning warped models into mooses is explained in the next subsection ) :    @xmath22[f ] { } { \\ar@{-}[rr ] |-{\\selecttips{eu}{}\\object@ { > } } } & & * = < 20pt>[o][f ] { } { \\ar@{-}[rr ] |-{\\selecttips{eu}{}\\object@{>}}}^{\\mbox{\\raisebox{1.5ex}{$\\sigma$ } } } & & * = <",
    "20pt>[o ] [ ] { } \\\\ \\mathrm{gauged : } & su(2 ) & & su(3 ) & & } \\end{tabular}\\ ] ]    by the rightmost  link , \" we mean simply that @xmath23 transforms as a @xmath24 of su(3 ) under the symmetries of that site .",
    "the use of @xmath15 in the holographic higgs was to communicate a certain pattern of symmetry breaking on the uv brane to the higgs on the ir brane .",
    "in the deconstructed version , this communication will necessarily take the form : @xmath25 we can represent the above chain as an operator that transforms under the @xmath17 symmetry of the ir site . at low energies ,",
    "it is reduced to being a spurion , and all interactions must remain invariant under the residual @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , there is only one type of nontrivial operator involving @xmath23 we can write down , @xmath26 , where    @xmath27    expanding out the @xmath28 case , we get    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is an overall coupling of mass dimension 1 . thus , with this term it is not possible to cancel the mass term without affecting the quartic as well .",
    "we could also include the @xmath31 contribution :    @xmath32    with @xmath33 some heavy mass on the ir site that induces this operator .",
    "we can imagine tuning the two contributions against each other .",
    "however , that will not be radiatively stable .",
    "this is the exact problem one encounters in the simplest little higgs @xcite .      in the original mchm papers ,",
    "the absence of quadratic divergences in the higgs radiative potential is justified in five dimensions . in this version of the theory ,",
    "the higgs is the zero mode of the bulk gauge field , @xmath2 .",
    "clearly , in the infinite bulk limit , it will have no self - interaction potential .",
    "after adding boundaries , we can still have the zero mode by imposing neumann boundary conditions on both branes .",
    "thus , contributions to the potential necessarily involve brane to brane propagators .",
    "the claim is that since these are long - distance and nonlocal , they are finite .",
    "however , this is bizarre from the point of view of holographic rg .",
    "integrating out high energy modes is equivalent to moving the uv brane toward the ir one , while inducing local operators on the former @xcite .",
    "thus , as we integrate out modes down to the weak scale , we lose the ability to credit the finiteness to a long - distance effect .",
    "the uv brane is now only a short distance from the ir .    to perform the integration",
    ", we deconstuct the fifth dimension into of a large number of sites . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider a simple example with a @xmath34 gauge theory in the bulk and @xmath34 on both branes .",
    "the setup is the following .",
    "we use a constant lattice spacing , @xmath35 , and a uniform bulk gauge coupling , @xmath36 . the 4d gauge coupling , @xmath37 ,",
    "will also be constant across sites .",
    "the link vevs , @xmath38 , change exponentially with scale , providing the remnant of the warp factor .",
    "following @xcite , we have    @xmath39    the gauge boson mass matrix for this setup will be :    @xmath40    the mass eigenstates will have @xmath41 etc .",
    "thus , a given massive particle is identified with a given site .",
    "we can integrate out particles simply by popping nodes off the uv end of the moose , then renormalizing @xmath37 and @xmath42 , ( fortunately , for arguments based on the symmetry structure , we will not need the exact running of @xmath37 . ) .",
    "the locality maintained by holographic rg thus manifests itself as theory space locality .",
    "such a simple trick would not work in flat space .",
    "the mass matrix in that setup would have a uniform value for @xmath42 , and we could no longer affiliate a given mass eigenstate with a certain site .    in the @xmath34 case , the link vevs higgs the theory to the diagonal .",
    "all link scalars are eaten in the process , and there is no candidate for a pgb .",
    "going now to mchm , we give the leftmost site an @xmath43 symmetry , the rightmost @xmath44 , and everything in between becomes @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46[f ] { } { \\ar@{-}[rr ] |-{\\selecttips{eu}{}\\object@ { > } } } & & * = < 20pt>[o][f ] { } { \\ar@{-}[r ] |-{\\selecttips{eu}{}\\object@",

    "the complication in this setup comes from the mismatch between bulk and brane symmetries . if we imagine starting at some high scale @xmath47 , we will have all gauge symmetries in the theory .",
    "as we descend beneath @xmath48 , the leftmost two gauge symmetries get higgsed to their diagonal , which is @xmath43 .",
    "thus , to integrate out the first set of heavy modes , we remove the leftmost node , but reduce the symmetry on the adjacent one to @xmath43 . since the @xmath43 site corresponds to the uv brane , we see that we have indeed moved it in toward the ir brane .",
    "we can now take the extreme deconstructed limit , replacing the entire extra dimensional setup with a three - site moose .",
    "the entire bulk of the extra dimension now consists of a single @xmath45 site .",
    "we can determine the existence of a pgb in mchm purely through goldstone counting . in limit that all gauge couplings turn off ,",
    "the links have an @xmath49 global symmetry , thus there will be 20 exact ngbs in the theory when they condense .",
    "however , when the gauge groups break to the @xmath43 diagonal , only 16 gauge bosons get masses , and we get a @xmath50 of @xmath44 pseudo .",
    "furthermore , its radiative potential is protected by collective symmetry breaking . setting to zero the gauge coupling on any particular site , we once again get 20 exact goldstones . with three gauge spurions needed to have a nonzero potential ,",
    "we have recovered the finiteness of the higgs mass .",
    "thus , the 5d warped model is protected by the same collective symmetry effect exploited in the little higgs .",
    "we can go further , reducing to two sites to recover the symmetry structure of the custodial minimal moose@xcite , was gauged , rather than an @xmath44 subgroup .",
    "this just has the effect of changing a quadruplet of heavy gauge bosons with no couplings to sm fermions into scalars .",
    "these extra pseudos make no one - loop contributions to the dimension six operators constrained by observables . ] which we will describe in detail below . working backward ,",
    "we could have started with two sites , getting manifest locality in theory space . by integrating in additional nodes with the appropriate warp factor",
    ", we can grow the extra dimension to an arbitrary number of sites while maintaining locality .",
    "any such nonlinear sigma model local in theory space is equivalent to georgi s vector limit @xcite , and free from one loop ( at least ) quadratic divergences because of collective symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "we will now review the setup of the custodial minimal moose ( cmm ) , a two - site , four - link little higgs model @xcite . in equation [ eqn:5deconstruct ] , we only have a single extra dimension , and thus each site is connected to its neighbors by just one link .",
    "deconstructing the theory to two sites , we can not write down a nonderivative term only involving the link , @xmath23 , without violating collective symmetry breaking . thus , the higgs potential is purely radiative and we get no parametric separation between the electroweak and nonlinear sigma scales .",
    "the solution for a two - site moose is to introduce three more links @xcite .",
    "this allows us to write plaquette operators that can generate an @xmath8 quartic .",
    "we give the details in the next subsection .",
    "the links transform under global @xmath51 symmetries with gauged @xmath43 and @xmath44 subgroups , respectively .",

    "the advantage of this setup over the original minimal moose @xcite is the existence of an explicit custodial symmetry , @xmath53 .",
    "contributions to the @xmath4 parameter from the heavy gauge boson @xmath54 are partially canceled by the charged bosons in its @xmath19 multiplet .",
    "this cancellation allows us to take a limit in which @xmath55 and @xmath54 decouple from sm fermions , thus suppressing contributions to observables from 4-fermi and higgs - fermi operators .",
    "our motivations for choosing an @xmath45 global symmetry are the same as in mchm .",
    "it is the smallest example of a group which contains both @xmath56 as a subgroup and a field in its adjoint with the right quantum numbers for the higgs .",
    "we will also consider versions of the model , which differ from that in @xcite .",
    "the third generation quarks can be modified to implement the left - right parity proposed in @xcite to protect @xmath57 .",
    "this provides an example of translating features from 5d to a little higgs model .",
    "additionally , we will discuss the idea of @xcite , imposing an exact @xmath58 symmetry that allows for stable dark matter candidates .",
    "the link fields acquire vevs proportional to the identity at a scale @xmath42 , breaking the gauge symmetry to @xmath59 , giving masses to six gauge bosons .",
    "an approximate @xmath60 symmetry among the links ensures that symmetry breaking occurs for each one at the same scale .",
    "we can study interactions in the theory by expanding in linearized fluctuations , @xmath61 , about the vacuum .",
    "@xmath62    where the @xmath63 are @xmath45 generators in the vector representation , normalized as in @xcite .",
    "since the linear combination @xmath64 shifts under the broken generators , we can identify the @xmath16 of @xmath44 components as the eaten goldstones .",
    "this leaves 34 uneaten scalars that acquire radiative potentials @xcite . to determine the masses of the heavy gauge bosons , we start with the lagrangian for a gauged nonlinear sigma model :    @xmath65    at lowest order in the pion expansion",
    ", we get a mass matrix for the gauge bosons , and the following eigenstates :    .gauge bosons in the custodial minimal moose [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the original cmm paper @xcite did not perform a global analysis , and actually came up with overly conservative constraints .",
    "the authors proposed a lower bound for @xmath42 at 700 gev , and only in the limit that @xmath66 . in table",
    "[ tbl : fvalues ] we see that we can get values of @xmath42 below 700 gev ( significantly in some cases ) , and even where @xmath67 .",
    "the previous limit was determined by finding the @xmath68 that would satisfy limits for the most constraining operator . by only comparing to an individual operator",
    ", one can get an artificially severe bound as one necessarily ignores cancellations between operators contributions to observables . for example , the 95% cl on @xmath0 considered individually ( 11.8 tev , 6.5 tev ) are nearly twice those arrived at when fit jointly ( 6.6 tev , 3.7 tev ) .",
    "thus , a weakening of constraints can occur from the addition of more operators .",

    "the regions above the thick black line are ruled out by a tachyonic physical higgs . ]",
    "we see that neither parameter is especially constrained even though we have imposed consistency with experiment , viable ewsb , correct value for @xmath75 , and a non - tachyonic physical higgs mass .",
    "there are similarly sized acceptable regions for both @xmath70 near its perturbative limit ( @xmath76 ) , and at @xmath67 . however , in accordance with our intuition , the small @xmath74 case has closer agreement to the data .",
    "we can increase the size of the regions of acceptance by increasing @xmath42 .",
    "figure [ fig : chi2thymb ] shows the limits in terms of @xmath77 and @xmath78 . for small values of @xmath74 , we have that    @xmath79     contours as a function of @xmath77 vs. @xmath72 for @xmath80 gev , @xmath81 .",

    "we must have @xmath824.5 tev for perturbativity in @xmath70 . for the values of @xmath71 ,",
    "@xmath42 plotted , the masses of @xmath77 and @xmath78 roughly track each other .",
    "even with new particles at the upper end of these mass scales , our higgs potential is still natural , receiving contributions @xmath83200 gev thanks to loop factor suppression .",
    "in studying theories of a pgb higgs , we do well conceptually and numerically to go to four dimensions . by deconstrucing the extra dimension and using holographic rg to run down",
    ", we can get an extreme deconstruction and describe the low energy physics in terms of a small moose .",
    "questions involving the symmetry of the theory , whether those protecting the higgs mass or those in a particular breaking pattern become straightforward to answer .",
    "in particular , we see that 5d warped models are just using collective symmetry breaking in the same way as the little higgs to protect the higgs potential .    in comparison with the data ,",
    "the 4d model requires no tunings , nor was any individual parameter significantly constrained , nor did the data force us into a corner of parameter space where observables make opposite demands upon the theory . the only additional symmetry needed for this",
    "was a gauged so(4 ) to get an explicit custodial su(2 ) .",
    "the fermion sector is modified by the presence of just one additional particle . by contrast , the 5d warped analogue has all of the above difficulties , and requires the addition of a left - right parity and the placement of quarks into exotic representations of so(4 ) to fix @xmath7 .",
    "as we search for the best realistic pgb higgs model , little higgs models with explicit @xmath53 make a strong case ( @xcite offers a coset theory example ) .",
    "we can turn any 5d warped model into a theory space little higgs , instantly alleviating the @xmath5 problem and allowing for parametric separation in the higgs potential between quartic and mass terms .",
    "the cmm is the simplest possible way to include both @xmath53 and an @xmath8 quartic without theory in theory space .",
    "that being said , it is not without some aesthetic unpleasantness .",
    "there are the @xmath84 and @xmath85 plaquettes , as well as the spinor links to which fermions couple",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether there is a more elegant model that performs as well in comparison to the data .",
    "given its success , we believe the cmm offers a standard against which to judge other theories of a pgb higgs .",
    "the @xmath86 function for our analysis is parameterized as follows :    @xmath87    in @xcite , the authors obtain the @xmath88 and @xmath89 from a global fit to the data of atomic parity violation , dis , lep , sld , and tevatron results .",
    "the @xmath90 are a subset of the 80 @xmath91 and @xmath92 conserving dimension six operators of the sm @xcite .",
    "one can eliminate several operators by demanding @xmath93 conservation , and remove all those with only colored particles .",
    "the latter step is justified by a lack of experimental constraints .",
    "lastly , we can impose various flavor symmetries .",
    "we will use @xmath94 , as our third generation makes the same contribution as the others at dimension six .",
    "this leaves us with 20 operators for comparison to data .",
    "operator , the triple gauge boson vertex correction , @xmath95 .",
    "however , since it is suppressed for the region of parameter space we are considering , we neglect it for the analysis . ]",
    "we can express the 20 operators in terms of four model parameters : @xmath96 and @xmath71 .",
    "the most complicated contributions are those from the higgs sector to @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "the higgs potential is given in equation [ eqn : higgspotl ] .",
    "in it , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are given by the coleman - weinberg potential .",
