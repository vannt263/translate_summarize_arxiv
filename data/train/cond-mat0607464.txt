    "the past several years have seen many new developments in ultracold atomic physics @xcite .",
    "two experimental control techniques have played a critical role in these advances : the use of optical lattices to produce diverse interaction configurations @xcite , and feshbach resonance to control the strength of the interactions between atoms @xcite .",
    "this has motivated significant interest in combining these two techniques @xcite .",
    "close to a broad feshbach resonance , one then has strongly interacting fermions in a lattice , with the effective interaction energy easily larger than the band gap .",
    "for such a strongly correlated system , in general it is very hard to understand its physics . as the first step",
    ", one may try to understand the single - site physics , which contains the dominant interactions for the atoms in a deep optical lattice .",
    "the two - body physics on a single site has been solved exactly in @xcite under typical experimental configurations , and it is found there that many bands of the lattice are significantly populated , in agreement with the experimental observation @xcite . in the next step , it is natural to consider interactions over a few lattice sites .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that for the case of a multiple - site lattice , one needs to take into account the direct collision interactions between the neighboring sites , as the magnitude of this interaction is larger than the atom tunneling rate for a typical wide feshbach resonance such as with @xmath0 or @xmath1 atoms .",
    "an effective lattice interaction hamiltonian has been derived there , which takes into account both the multi - band populations and the direct off - site and on - site collisions . in this effective hamiltonian",
    ", whenever two atoms come to the same lattice site , they form a dressed molecule state ( a single - site cooper pair ) , which corresponds to an exact eigenstate constructed from the single - site physics .",
    "the effective hamiltonian then describes the interaction between these dressed molecules and the atoms over different lattice sites .",
    "the explicit form of the hamiltonian is as follows @xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent creation operators for fermionic atoms and bosonic dressed molecules , respectively ; @xmath5 labels two internal spin states ; and @xmath6 labels the lattice sites ( with @xmath7 labeling the sites adjacent to @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xmath8 represents a projection of the state at every lattice site @xmath6 onto the four - dimensional subspace with basis @xmath9 .",
    "the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 depend on the physical properties of the atomic system as well as the multi - band properties of the optical lattice ( see the explicit expressions in @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 corresponds to an eigenenergy of the two - body physics from a single site , and can be tuned over a wide range of values by varying the applied magnetic field @xmath15 @xcite .    in this paper , we make use of the above effective hamiltonian @xmath16 to study the physics of this strongly correlated system with interactions among a few lattice sites . in particular , we focus on investigation of the states of a single plaquette , which is a basic unit of the two - dimensional square lattice .",
    "this study has two purposes .",
    "first , understanding the states of atoms at a single plaquette is a necessary step towards the challenging goal of understanding the physics of this strongly interacting gas in a quasi - two - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the effective hamiltonian @xmath16 reduces  to the well - known t - j model @xcite and the xxz model @xcite in certain limits of the parameter values , so the physics associated with @xmath16 should be rich and parameter - dependent . in this work",
    ", we would like to understand the influence of the parameters on a few body physics , and that understanding will provide an intuition for taking appropriate approximations towards the many - body physics .",
    "in particular , from the few - body physics , we construct states which will provide the basic entries for an effective many - body theory through the contractor renormalization procedure ( a real - space renormalizaton group method for high dimensions ) @xcite .",
    "we will see that even for a single plaquette , the behavior of the states has been pretty rich .",
    "the eigenstates involve resonating valence bonds and superposition of dressed molecules , and are highly entangled over different lattice sites .",
    "with variation of the parameters in the hamiltonian @xmath16 , there are several level crossings for the lowest eigenstate with change of the state symmetry properties , which may correspond to a quantum phase transition for larger systems .",
    "second , the study of the physics of a single plaquette is also of practical relevance . for atoms in an optical superlattice , the physics can be dominated by the interactions within single plaquettes .",
    "a simple optical superlattice can be formed by adding two standing wave laser beams with commensurate wave vectors @xcite .",
    "the potential , say , along the @xmath17 direction , has the form @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "if we choose the wave vector @xmath19 and require @xmath20 , then we have potential barriers of two different heights ( see fig . [ superlat ] ) .",
    "the minima occur at @xmath21 ( for integer @xmath22 ) , where @xmath23 the lower and higher potential barriers @xmath24 and @xmath25 are given respectively by @xmath26 the barrier @xmath25 can be significantly larger than @xmath24 if we choose @xmath27 close to @xmath28 , and such a high barrier turns off the interactions except for the ones between the sites separated by @xmath24 . if we apply this optical superlattice potential along both the x and y directions and a deep lattice potential along the z direction , we then have interactions dominantly within the single plaquettes in the x - y plane . with strongly interacting atoms in this optical superlattice potential , one can test the predictions from the effective hamiltonian @xmath16 , and detect the exotic entangled states emerging from the ground state configurations of @xmath16 .     for @xmath29    we should also point out that the effective hamiltonian @xmath16 includes the hubbard model as a particular case .",
    "the hubbard model is given by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "specifically , @xmath16 can be written in the form of @xmath32 if we substitute @xmath33 with @xmath34 and make a particular choice of the parameters in @xmath16 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "so , one can see that @xmath16 extends the well - known hubbard model @xmath32 in a nontrivial way .",
    "note that for strongly interacting atoms near a broad feshbach resonance , the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath13 are significantly different from the atomic tunneling rate @xmath40 due to the multi - band populations and the direct neighboring collisions . from the expressions of these parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate that typically @xmath41 @xmath42 . this is because @xmath12 corresponds to atomic tunneling in the single lowest band , whereas @xmath13 and @xmath10 correspond to interactions involving the dressed molecule states ( which are superpositions of states in multiple upper bands ) . for the numerical calculations in this work",
    ", we typically take @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45@xmath46 , and @xmath47 @xmath42@xmath48 .",
    "( note from the form of @xmath16 that the sign of @xmath10 is essentially irrelevant , as it can be incorporated into the definition of @xmath49 . )",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is sensitive to the external magnetic field , and can be scanned from the value much smaller than @xmath50 to the value much larger than @xmath51 .",
    "the atomic states within each plaquette critically depend on the atom number and the spin configuration in that plaquette . in the following",
    ", we will consider all the different nontrivial cases with different numbers of spin @xmath52 and @xmath53 atoms occupying the four - site plaquette .",
    "over most of the typical range of the parameter values , the plaquette occupied by two @xmath54 and two @xmath53 atoms has two distinct types of ground states , with a level crossing occurring at some critical value of @xmath14 .",
    "these two types of states can be distinguished by how they transform under a @xmath55 rotation in the plane of the plaquette .",
    "under such a rotation , the ground state wavefunction for @xmath56 less than ( greater than ) the critical value is multiplied by a factor of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "thus , we say that the phase on the negative side of the transition has s - wave symmetry , and that on the positive side has d - wave symmetry .",
    "the ground states of each of these two types change smoothly with changes in the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we can identify particular energy eigenstates as the `` s - wave state '' and the `` d - wave state '' over the full range of @xmath56 , even as the exact form of the eigenstate changes .",
    "( note that these are not the _ only _ eigenstates with s - wave and d - wave symmetry  here we use these terms to refer solely to those states which are the ground states when the system is in the corresponding parameter regions . )",
    "the energies of the s - wave and d - wave states can be easily calculated through exact diagonalization , and they are plotted in fig .",
    "[ spect22](a ) , which illustrates the crossover between them .",
    "( for this figure , we scan @xmath14 and set the other parameters of @xmath16 to their typical values with @xmath59 and @xmath60 . ) the energy gap between the ground state and 1st excited state is shown in fig .",

    "( b ) : energy difference ( gap ) between ground state and first excited state .",
    "the gap vanishes at the level crossing point . because the eigenenergies vary smoothly with @xmath65 , the curve is smooth except at the level crossing points for the ground state ( where the gap is zero ) and for the first excited state ( indicated by arrows ) ]    to understand the properties of the ground state , it is important to have its explicit expression . although one can calculate this explicit expression through numerical exact diagonalization , the state is in general a superposition of many basis - vectors ( @xmath66 vectors in this case ) , with all the superposition coefficients varying with @xmath14 .",
    "it is troublesome to understand the state s properties from this lengthy expression . to overcome this problem",
    ", we describe the s - wave and d - wave states more compactly , in a way that illustrates their rotational symmetry , by means of a pictorial representation which we define here .",
    "the four sites of a plaquette we label as : .",
    "we place various pictures on these sites corresponding to creation operators applied at those sites .",
    "the whole picture represents the product of these operators , applied to the vacuum state @xmath67 . for instance ,   placed on two sites ( either horizontally , vertically , or diagonally ) represents a normalized singlet between those two sites .",
    "so , if the sites are labeled @xmath6 and @xmath68 , this represents @xmath69 .",

    "so , the states are equivalent to those in the case with two spin-@xmath54 and one spin-@xmath53 atoms , but with exchange of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath12 in the effective hamiltonian @xmath16 .",
    "the sign of g also changes , but as noted above this is equivalent to replacing @xmath49 with @xmath190 .",
    "thus this change has no effect on the eigenenergies , and the eigenstates only experience a change in the sign of those components where the plaquette is occupied by an odd number of dressed molecules .",
    "in addition , if particle - hole exchange changes the number of atoms by @xmath191 , then the eigenenergies are shifted by @xmath192 .    from this investigation ,",
    "we have seen that even on a single plaquette , the hamiltonian @xmath16 exhibits a number of different types of ground state configurations , possessing various forms of rotational symmetry ( s - wave , d - wave , etc . ) .",
    "there are level crossings between these different types of ground states as the detuning @xmath14 is varied .",
    "the change of the ground state symmetry from s - wave to d - wave as one scans the parameter @xmath56 from negative to positive regions may be a general feature and not limited to a single plaquette . for a large lattice",
    ", this symmetry change might correspond to a quantum phase transition from the s - wave to the d - wave superfluidities @xcite .",
    "the states found in this work on a single plaquette also provide some basic entries for constructing the effective many - body hamiltonian for atoms in a quasi - two - dimensional optical lattice through the contractor renormalization method @xcite .",
    "when the average filling number of the lattice is close to a half with hole doping , one expects that the basic degrees of freedom from each plaquette are the ground state configurations specified in sec .",
    "ii , the fermionic hole excitations given by the states in sec .",
    "v , the bosonic hole - pair excitations specified in sec .",
    "iv , and the bosonic spin excitations given by the states in sec .",
    "iii and ii .",
    "the effective many - body hamiltonian will then describe the interaction between these basic degrees of freedom .",
    "so , it is our hope that the investigation of the single - plaquette physics here will make it possible to better understand the physics of strongly interacting fermions on larger lattices ."
