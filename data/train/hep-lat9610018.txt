    "the current work was motivated by our search for an alternative implementation of the hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) algorithm in lattice qcd which does not require the use of pseudofermions our proposed algorithm ( which is described in more detail in @xcite requires the estimation of determinant ratios @xmath1 where the matrices @xmath2 and @xmath3 satisfy the following conditions : @xmath2 and @xmath3 are huge ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 ) ; the eigenvalues of @xmath2 and @xmath3 have positive real parts ; @xmath6 are @xmath7 , but @xmath8 is @xmath9 ; and the eigenvalues of @xmath3 are continuous perturbations of the eigenvalues of @xmath2",
    ".    in this paper we present a new method for estimating such determinant ratios , which takes advantage of pad approximation and @xmath0 noise vectors ( hence the acronym pz ) .",
    "the potential application of related methods to estimating the density of states . is also indicated .",
    "our improved algorithm is based on the approximation of @xmath10 with a rational function via the use of pad approximants .",
    "the pad approximation to @xmath11 of order @xmath12 $ ] at @xmath13 is a rational function @xmath14 where deg@xmath15 = deg@xmath16 = @xmath17 , whose value and first @xmath18 derivatives agree with @xmath19 at the specified point @xmath13 .",
    "when the pad approximation is expressed in partial fractions , we obtain    @xmath20    which implies @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ = \\sum_{j=1}^{j } a_{j } \\left\\{tr({\\bf m}_{1 } + b_{j})^{-1 } -                                          tr({\\bf m}_{2}+b_{j})^{-1 } \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the traces of inverse matrices @xmath22 may then be found using the @xmath0 noise method @xcite , and it follows    @xmath23 \\approx \\frac{1}{l }   \\sum_{j , l } a_{j } \\eta_{l}^{\\dagger } ( \\xi_{j , l}^{(1 ) } - \\xi_{j , l}^{(2)}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 are complex @xmath0 noise vectors , and the @xmath25 are vectors defined by :    @xmath26",
    "the pz method takes advantage of proven , effective numerical approximation techniques .",
    "pad approximation uses rational functions , which are very efficient when it comes to uniform approximation of analytic functions : for example , an @xmath27 $ ] pad expansion of @xmath19 around @xmath28 is accurate to within @xmath29 on the interval @xmath30 $ ] . in our application , the pad approximation to the logarithm only needs to be accurate on the region in the complex plane where the spectra of @xmath2 and @xmath3 differ .",
    "also , complex @xmath0 random vectors have been shown to be superior to gaussian in computing traces of inverse matrices .",
    "the pz method is also in a position to take advantage of recent results on efficient solution of linear problems with multiple diagonal shifts .",
    "the column inversions in [ xi_def ] for fixed @xmath31 may be performed using gmres with multiquarks in the same computational time it takes to solve just one  only more memory is required ( an additional vector for each j ) @xcite .",
    "this can lead to a considerable speedup in the algorithm .",
    "hence , a higher order pad expansion requires more memory , but the same computation time ( apart from matrix conditioning effects , see next paragraph ) .",
    "the multi - quark gmres method can be applied to non - hermitian matrices : so determinants of non - hermitian matrices may also be found directly , without recourse to the hermitian matrix @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 s turn out to have positive real parts , and negligable imaginary parts : thus the matrices @xmath34 are better- conditioned than @xmath35 , and the column inversions should be faster .    however , this effect diminishes for higher order pad approximations , because the real parts of some terms become smaller .",
    "the pz method also holds promise of being useful in the case where different quark flavors are present , in which case it is necessary to compute    @xmath36    using multi - quark gmres , this takes the same amount of computation as a single determinant ratio .",
    "figure 1 shows the result of numerical experiments involving the matrix @xmath2 associated with a typical ( heatbath - generated ) quenched gauge configuration on a @xmath37 lattice with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and the matrix @xmath3 generated from @xmath40 by updating 20 links in a heatbath .",
    "the pz estimates of @xmath41 using a @xmath42 $ ] pad approximation with up to 50 @xmath43 noise vectors is shown in figure 1 , and the jackknife error is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the pz estimate of the real part of @xmath44 ( using ( 1 ) with an additional term @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) is shown in figure 3 , while the corresponding jackknife errors are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the pz estimate of the imaginary part of @xmath44 is shown in figure 5 ( the actual value is 0 ) .",
    "these results demonstrate that the pz method leads to controlled error in determinant ratios after a relatively small number of column inversions .",
    "there are three sources of numerical error in the pz method : pad approximation ; @xmath0 estimation ; and column inversion via gmres .",
    "the pad error can be virtually eliminated by taking more terms in the pad expansion , which requires more memory but not more computation time .",
    "a theoretical expression for the @xmath0 error is    @xcite :    @xmath47    the column inversion error is reduced by taking more iterations , at the cost of increased computation time .",
    "the computation time depends on the number of noise vectors required to get a good trace estimate .",
    "if gmres is used , each noise vector used gives rise to one column inversion .",
    "it should be mentioned that alternatives to pad approximation have been proposed , including chebyshev polynomials @xcite and stieltjes integrals @xcite .",
    "numerical experiments should be performed to determine which is more efficient .",
    "some of the ideas introduced above may be used to estimate the density of states @xmath48 as follows .",
    "any term of the form      can be used as a `` probe '' to sample spectral information near the specified pole @xmath33 .",
    "hence @xmath48 can be estimated via the following procedure : ( 1 ) choose @xmath17 complex numbers @xmath33 which are strategically placed around the support of @xmath50 ; ( 2 ) estimate @xmath51 using the @xmath0 noise method ; ( 3 ) specify a fitting form for @xmath50 using @xmath17 parameters : @xmath52 ; and ( 4 ) find the parameters @xmath53 by solving the equations        ritzenhfer , k. schilling , and a. frommer , hep - lat/9605008 .",
