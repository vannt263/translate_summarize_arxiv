    "rydberg excitations of ultracold atoms  @xcite are currently attracting tremendous attention because of possible applications in quantum computing  @xcite and simulation  @xcite .",
    "one particular aspect is the realization of few - photon nonlinearities mediated by rydberg interaction  @xcite , enabling novel schemes for highly efficient single - photon generation  @xcite , entanglement creation between light and atomic excitations  @xcite , single - photon all - optical switches  @xcite and transistors  @xcite , single - photon absorbers  @xcite and interaction - induced photon phase shifts  @xcite .",
    "interacting rydberg polaritons also enable attractive forces between single photons  @xcite , crystallization of photons  @xcite and photonic scattering resonances  @xcite .",
    "the above experiments and proposals make use of the long - range electric dipole - dipole interaction between rydberg atoms  @xcite .",
    "a highly useful tool for controlling the interaction are stark - tuned frster resonances , where two dipole - coupled pair states are shifted into resonance by a dc  @xcite or microwave  @xcite electric field .",
    "frster resonances have been studied by observation of dipole blockade  @xcite , line shape analysis  @xcite , double - resonance spectroscopy  @xcite , excitation statistics  @xcite , and ramsey spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "recently , resonant four - body interaction  @xcite and the anisotropic blockade on frster resonance  @xcite , and quasi - forbidden frster resonances  @xcite have been observed and frster resonances between different atomic species have been predicted  @xcite . for rydberg - mediated single - photon transistors , the near - resonance in zero field for specific pair states has been used to enhance the transistor gain  @xcite , while in experiments on rydberg atom imaging  @xcite an increase in rydberg excitation hopping has been observed on resonance  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use stark - tuned frster resonances to greatly increase the interaction between individual photons inside a rydberg medium .",
    "we achieve this by tuning pair states @xmath0 containing two different rydberg @xmath1-states into resonance with @xmath2 pair states by an electric field .",
    "we show that for gate and source rydberg states @xmath3 we can boost the performance of a rydberg single - photon transistor .",
    "when operated classically , we achieve @xmath4 , enabling high - fidelity detection of single rydberg atoms .",
    "this improved transistor can be operated such that the gate photon is read out with finite efficiency , reaching a gain @xmath5 .",
    "we develop theoretical models for the dynamics of rydberg polaritons in the presence of frster resonances and the loss of coherence due to photon scattering .",
    "excellent agreement with our experimental data is found .",
    "finally , our all - optical probe represents a novel approach for the high - resolution study of the substructure of frster resonances caused by fine structure and stark / zeeman splitting of the @xmath2 pair states .",
    "we demonstrate this technique by resolving the multi - resonance structure of the @xmath6 pair state .",
    "* experimental setup . * our experimental scheme  @xcite is shown in fig.[resonances]a , b : by coupling the excited state @xmath7 and the rydberg state @xmath8 with a strong light field @xmath9 with detuning @xmath10 , a gate photon @xmath11 is converted into a rydberg excitation inside a cloud of ultracold @xmath12rb atoms .",
    "we then probe the presence of this gate excitation by monitoring the transmission of source photons @xmath13 coupled via electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) to the source rydberg state @xmath14 .",
    "specifically , we use ( @xmath15{mhz}$ ] ) for efficient raman absorption of the gate photon in the experiments without retrieval , while we use eit based slow light techniques ( @xmath16 ) for photon storage in experiments with gate photon retrieval . at zero electric field ,",
    "the interaction between the @xmath0 pair is of van der waals type .",
    "the difference in electric polarizability between @xmath1- and @xmath17-states enables the shift of the initial pair state into degeneracy with specific @xmath2 pairs , resulting in resonant dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "we shift the rydberg levels by applying a homogeneous electric field along the direction of beam propagation .",
    "active cancellation of stray electric fields is done with 8 electric field plates in lw configuration  @xcite , while the homogeneous field results from additional voltages @xmath18 to four electrodes ( fig.[resonances]a )",
    ".    * stark - tuned optical nonlinearities .",
    "* we first study the pair state @xmath19 . due to the fine structure splitting of the rydberg @xmath17-states ,",
    "this pair is near resonant with two @xmath17-state pairs @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "both @xmath2 pairs can be tuned into resonance at electric fields @xmath22{\\volt \\centi\\metre^{-1}}$ ] .",
    "the full pair state stark map in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath23{\\gauss}$ ] ( fig.[resonances]c , gray lines ) reveals a large number of closely spaced resonances arising from the non - degenerate @xmath24 combinations .",
    "the strength of individual resonances depends on the angle @xmath25 between the interatomic axis and the quantization axis defined by the external fields , resulting in a non - spherical blockade volume  @xcite .",
    "we explore these resonances by measuring the optical gain @xmath26 i.e. , the mean number of source photons scattered by a single incident gate photon  @xcite , as a function of applied electric field ( fig.[resonances]c ) .",
    "our high - resolution spectroscopy indeed reveals four resonances , matching with the calculated crossings of different pair state groups . in between resonances , the coupling of @xmath0 to multiple @xmath2 pair states with positive and negative frster defects results in smaller blockade than in the zero - field case .",
    "this interplay between different resonances actually decreases the measured gain with respect to the field - free value .",
    "this situation does not occur for the frster resonance @xmath27 at @xmath28{\\volt \\centi\\metre^{-1}}$ ] ( fig.[resonances]d ) .",
    "for this state combination there is one isolated resonance , resulting in the single peak in the optical gain .    * rydberg polaritons near frster resonance . * to quantitatively describe the observed resonances we include in the microscopic description of polariton propagation  @xcite the special character of the interaction close to frster resonance , see supplementary note  1 . for illustration",
    ", we consider the @xmath3 pair and angle @xmath29 , which results in the selection rule @xmath30 for the magnetic quantum numbers of the involved states .",
    "we then need to include four pair states : @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33,@xmath34 with @xmath35 . in this basis",
    ", the interaction hamiltonian reduces to @xmath36 with two dipolar coupling parameters @xmath37 .",
    "since the interaction is dominated by the frster resonance , we neglect any residual van der waals interactions . in general , the hamiltonian  ( [ interaction ] ) gives rise to flip - flop ( _ hopping _ ) processes of type @xmath38 .",
    "however , for this choice of rydberg states the dipolar coupling parameters satisfy @xmath39 , and therefore provide a strong suppression of hopping  @xcite .",
    "this behavior is in contrast to the results in ref.@xcite , where hopping processes strongly influenced the interaction mediated imaging of rydberg excitations . in the experimentally relevant regime with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the source photon detuning , while @xmath42 and @xmath43 describe the decoherence rates of @xmath14 and @xmath44 excitations , the equation describing a single polariton @xmath45 and its interaction with the gate rydberg excitation @xmath8 at position @xmath46 simplifies to @xmath47 as derived in our supplementary note  1 . here",
    ", @xmath48 is the collective coupling strength with @xmath49 being the single atom - photon coupling strength and @xmath50 is the atomic density .",
    "the effective interaction @xmath51 simplifies to @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the frster defect .",
    "it is remarkable that , regardless of @xmath53 , our microscopic derivation provides an effective interaction always based on van der waals type interaction .    for comparison with experiment ,",
    "we generalize our calculation to nonzero angles @xmath25 between the quantization and interatomic axis as well as to the larger number of states involved for the @xmath6 pair .",
    "we then integrate eq.([eequation ] ) over the cloud shape and average over the stored spin - wave .",
    "we also take into account the poissonian statistics of the gate and source photons , the storage efficiency , the fact that the blockade radius is comparable to the beam waist , and the finite experimental resolution in electric - field @xmath54{\\milli\\volt \\centi\\meter^{-1}}$ ] , see supplementary note  1 . the comparison , without any free parameters , with experimental results for the gain",
    "is shown in fig.[resonances ] .",
    "we find very good agreement for all electric fields except very close to the resonances .",
    "one reason for the discrepancy is the following : close to the frster resonance and for distances on the order of @xmath55 between gate and source , the atomic part of the polariton - excitation pair initially in @xmath3 is converted into the superposition of @xmath32 and @xmath3 .",
    "this results in additional slowing down of the polariton , and , consequently , an accumulation of polaritons close to @xmath55 . then , the assumption to study the propagation of individual polaritons breaks down as the interaction between the polaritons has to be included .    * transistor gain and single rydberg detection .",
    "* performance of the single - photon transistor on the @xmath27 resonance .",
    "( * a * ) gain and single rydberg detection fidelity increase linearly with the rate of incident source photons @xmath56 in the nondestructive range where the creation of stationary excitations from source photons is negligible .",
    "both the optical gain ( * a * ) and the single rydberg detection fidelity ( * a*,*b * ) are highly amplified on the frster resonance at @xmath28{\\volt \\centi\\metre^{-1}}$ ] .",

    "* next , we investigate to what extent these frster resonances can be used to improve the rydberg single photon transistor  @xcite .",
    "we find that for this application , the @xmath3 resonance is ideal .",
    "it enables large source photon input rates , because of the relatively weak van der waals interaction between two source photons . on the other hand ,",
    "the frster resonance provides sufficient gate - source interaction to observe high transistor gain .",
    "for source photon rate @xmath57{\\micro\\second^{-1}}$ ] we reach a maximal gain of @xmath58 . at such high source rates",
    "we observe small temporal changes in transmission which we attribute to an accumulation of stationary rydberg excitations in the medium caused by dephasing of single source polaritons .",
    "this effect has been previously observed for rydberg @xmath1-states  @xcite and differs from the interaction - induced dephasing of @xmath59-state polariton pairs  @xcite .",
    "this accumulation sets an upper limit on the source photon rate for the non - destructive imaging of single rydberg excitations  @xcite , since the creation of additional rydberg atoms also `` destroys '' the original system .",
    "we thus restrict our analysis in fig.[fidelity ] to non - destructive source input rates for which the maximum temporal change in source transmission remains smaller than 10% . in this regime",
    ", we observe a linear increase of the optical gain with @xmath56 both at zero electric field and on the frster resonance ( fig.[fidelity]a ) .",
    "exploiting the frster resonance we can improve the optical gain by a factor @xmath60 on resonance ( blue dots ) compared to the zero field case ( blue squares ) .",
    "the large number of source photons scattered from a single gate excitation enables the single shot detection of a stored gate photon with high fidelity  @xcite , see methods . in fig.[fidelity ] we show this fidelity as a function of the applied electric field for two source photon rates .",
    "the frster resonance enables a substantial increase of the fidelity to a maximal value of @xmath61 .",
    "this number is mainly limited by the fact that our beam waist @xmath62 is slightly larger than the gate - source blockade distance . for spatially resolved rydberg detection  @xcite ,",

    ", we obtain the blue solid line in fig.[coherent]a , which is in very good agreement with our data , despite the simplifications of our model .",
    "we consider this as evidence for the assumed mechanisms for the spin - wave decoherence to be correct . by identifying the decoherence mechanisms",
    ", we can isolate the required improvements for a high - fidelity coherent rydberg transistor : the blockade volume of a single gate excitation must be larger than the stored gate spin - wave to avoid the projection , while the optical depth @xmath77 inside the blockaded region must be large to prevent the dephasing due to transmitted photons . meeting both requirements simultaneously is challenging due to limits on the atomic density because of rydberg - ground state interaction  @xcite .",

    "<S> this technique boosts the gain of a single - photon transistor to over 100 , enhances the non - destructive detection of single rydberg atoms to a fidelity beyond 0.8 , and enables high precision spectroscopy on rydberg pair states . on top </S>",
    "<S> , we achieve a gain larger than 2 with gate photon read - out after the transistor operation . </S>",
    "<S> theory models for rydberg polariton propagation on frster resonance and for the projection of the stored spin - wave yield excellent agreement to our data and successfully identify the main decoherence mechanism of the rydberg transistor , paving the way towards photonic quantum gates . </S>"
