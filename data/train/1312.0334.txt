    "schrijver et al . (",

    "1993 ; chae et al.2001 ; hagenaar 2001 ; hagenaar et al .",
    "2008 ) , their origin is still under debate . some studies ( harvey et al .",
    "1975 ; hoyng 1992 ) suggest that ers may be the small - scale tail of a wide spectrum of magnetic activity and also generated by the global dynamo , which has been commonly considered as the production mechanism of active regions ( kosovichev 1996 ; dikpati & gilman 2001 ; mason et al .",
    "this means that ers are speculated to come from the bottom of convective zone . however , many authors argued that , ers are generated in local turbulent convection , i.e. , by a local dynamo populating everywhere near the solar surface ( nordlund 1992 ; cattaneo 1999 ; hagenaar et al . 2003 ; stein et al .",
    "2003 ) . besides the above models , some people ( nordlund 1992 ; ploner et al .",
    "2001 ) also proposed another possible origin , i.e. , recycle of magnetic flux from decayed and dispersed active regions .    in a former study ( yang et al .",
    "2012 ) using observations from the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; schou et al . 2012 ; scherrer et al .",
    "2012 ) onboard _ sdo _ , we have reported that ers can be classified into two types : normal ers and self - canceled ones .",
    "both of them have the same early evolution process : emerging and growing with separation of the opposite polarities .",
    "after that , the dipolar patches of normal ers cancel or merge with the surrounding magnetic fields , while for self - canceled ones , a part of magnetic fields with opposite polarities move back , meet together , and cancel with each other gradually , performing a behavior termed  self - cancellation . \" considering the same emergence process of the normal ers and the self - canceled ones , we can combine them together and investigate their properties at the emergence stage .",
    "the properties of ers during emergence process are helpful for us to provide the necessary parameters for numerical simulation and to understand the essence of ers , e.g. , to know the ratio of emergence duration to lifetime . in previous studies , only several er parameters at the emergence stage",
    "are roughly determined just based on small samples ( e.g. , schrijver et al . 1998 ; wang et al .",

    "these advantages are helpful for us to statistically study the properties of ers . in this study",

    "2012 ) at 12:00 ut on june 13 is also adopted .",

    "ers are identified as dipolar patches with opposite polarities emerge simultaneously or one following the other , and then grow and separate .",
    "each er is identified and tracked by eyes , which makes our results are very reliable .",
    "we define the time when both the positive and the negative patches are detected as the start time ( _ t@xmath20 _ ) of the emergence . if the strength of a magnetic patch exceeds the noise level , 10.2 mx @xmath21 ( liu et al .",

    "we can see that the separation distance ( panel ( a ) ) , emergence duration ( panel ( b ) ) , flux emergence rate ( panel ( d ) ) , area ( panel ( e ) ) , and flux density ( panel ( f ) ) are positively correlated with the magnetic flux . while the separation velocity has a negative correlation with the magnetic flux ( panel ( c ) ) .",

    "harvey & harvey ( 1976 ) have found that the flux emergence rate is large for the larger ers , and zhao & li ( 2012 ) showed that the emergence duration and flux growth rate are positively correlated to the total emerging flux , which are supported by our results ( see figures 5(b ) and 5(d ) ) .",
    "we also compute the magnetic centroid of each er using its total unsigned magnetic flux . during the emergence , the magnetic centroid does not keep stable , and there exists a shift on the solar surface .",

    "the shift velocity is negatively correlated with the magnetic flux ( panel ( d ) ) , indicating that the higher the total magnetic flux is , the slower the er s centroid shifts .      besides the separation movement and shift movement , ers also rotate during the emergence , leading to the change of orientation .",
    "an example of er rotation is given in figure 8 .",

    "six parameters , i.e. , magnetic flux , area , flux density , separation distance , shift distance , and rotation angle are also determined .",
    "moreover , we find that the higher the er magnetic flux is , ( 1 ) the further the two polarities separate , ( 2 ) the longer the emergence lasts , ( 3 ) the slower the separation is , ( 4 ) the higher the flux emergence rate is , ( 5 ) the larger the area is , ( 6 ) the stronger the er field is , ( 7 ) the larger the shift distance is , ( 8) the slower the er s centroid shifts , and ( 9 ) the lower the absolute angular speed is .",
    "in addition , we notice that the regions with locations around s15@xmath3 and around n25@xmath3 have larger number density .",
    "there are at least three kinds of convective cells according to their sizes , i.e. , granulation , mesogranulation , and supergranulation ( simon & leighton 1964 ; rast 2003 ) . the horizontal velocity of supergranular flows is determined to be about 0.3@xmath280.5 km s@xmath2 ( leighton et al .",
    "1962 ; simon & leighton 1964 ) .",
    "magnetic elements which emerge within the supergranular cells are advected toward to the supergranular borders with a velocity of about 0.4 km s@xmath2 ( zhang et al .",
    "however , as revealed by our results and also observed by schrijver et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the separation velocity of dipolar patches at the emergence stage is much larger .",
    "we suggest that , when magnetic flux tubes rise from below the photosphere , the @xmath33@xmath28shaped tubes are mainly affected by the buoyant force and can be ejected into the atmosphere of the sun with a high velocity , leading to a rapid separation of the positive and negative polarities . after the emergence stage ,",
    "magnetic patches are mainly driven by horizontal supergranular flows , and thus the separation slows down .",
    "we also find that the average shift velocity ( 0.9 km s@xmath2 ) of the ers is larger than that of the supergranular flows .",
    "it may be due to the existence of configuration asymmetry of ers .",
    "when ers emerge , the separation of dipolar patches is not symmetric , so the shifts are observed .",
    "another possible interpretation is that the planes the flux tubes are located in are not vertical , i.e. , there exits tilt angles relative to the solar radial direction .",
    "as soon as they rise and get through the photosphere , the flux tubes will become vertical , resulting in the magnetic centroid sideward shifts ( see figure 6 ) . as shown in this study",
    ", ers display a rotation of their axes .",
    "one possible reason is that the chaotic convective motions shear and distort the dipolar patches .",
    "another illustration is that the rotation is caused by the relaxation of twisted ers ( patsourakos et al .",
    "2008 ) , implying the structures of ers are quite complicate .",
    "the most popular model about the formation of active regions is that they are generated by a dynamo action at the bottom of the convection zone , where the tachocline is located ( dikpati & gilman 2001 ; mason et al .",
    "the tachocline is a transition layer of solar rotation , from the solid - body rotation of the radiative interior to the differential rotation of the convection zone ( kosovichev 1996 ) .",
    "the large shear in the tachocline can form and store large scale fields , which will emerge through the solar surface due to buoyant force ( parker 1993 ) .",
    "active regions are aligned generally in the east - west direction with a few degrees because of the effect of coriolis force during the emergence of flux tubes ( hale et al .",
    "1919 ; schmidt 1968 ) . but for the ers in our study , not only at the start time , but also at the end time , their orientations are basically randomly oriented in both the northern and the southern hemispheres ( figure 10 ) . besides , neither the anticlockwise rotated ers , nor the clockwise rotated ones dominate the northern or the southern hemisphere ( figure 12 ) .",
    "the locations of the ers spread all over the target from s60@xmath3 to n60@xmath3 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "these results imply that , differing from active regions , it seems that er flux is not generated by the global dynamo , and it may be generated by a local dynamo . however , small flux systems are greatly affected by convective motion below the solar photosphere and will eventually have random orientation when they emerge even if they may have been generated by the global dynamo .",
    "so we can not exclude the possibility that they may be generated by the global dynamo .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows that , instead of the equatorial or the high latitudinal regions , the regions at around s15@xmath3 and n25@xmath3 ( the general latitudes of active regions ) have larger er number density , indicating that the recycle of magnetic flux from decayed and dispersed active regions may be another origin of the magnetic flux of ers .                                                                                                ,",
    "emergence duration ( panel ( b ) ) , separation velocity ( panel ( c ) ) , flux emergence rate ( panel ( d ) ) , area ( panel ( e ) ) at t@xmath22 , and flux density ( panel ( f ) ) at t@xmath22 .",
