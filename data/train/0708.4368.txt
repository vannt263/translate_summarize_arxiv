    "the problems posed by dune mobility have been solved in practice using different techniques .",
    "small dunes can be mechanically flattened so that sand moves as individual grains rather than as a single body . however , such methods are too expensive for large dunes .",
    "these can be immobilized covering them with oil or by the erection of fences .",
    "these solutions have the drawback of not providing a long term protection since the sand remains exposed . to overcome this shortcoming ,",
    "a suitable solution is to vegetate the sand covered areas in order to prevent sediment transport and erosion @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important for coastal management where a strong sand transport coexists with favorable conditions for vegetation growth .",
    "the stabilization of mobile sand using vegetation is an ancient technique .",
    "this method has been used with excellent results on coastal dunes in algeria , tunisia , north america , united kingdom , western europe , south africa , israel among others @xcite .",
    "vegetation tries to stabilize sand dunes @xcite , preventing sand motion @xcite and stimulating soil recovery @xcite .",
    "recently , we developed a mathematical description of the competition between vegetation growth and sand transport @xcite .",
    "this model was capable to reproduce the transformation of active barchan dunes into parabolic dunes under the action of vegetation growth as can be found in real conditions . since numerical simulations are orders of magnitude faster than the real evolution , we are able to study the entire inactivation process and to forecast thousands of years of real evolution .",
    "parabolic dunes are vegetated dunes that , when active , migrate along the prevailing wind direction .",
    "they arise under uni - directional wind and in places partially covered by plants and have a typical @xmath0 shape with the ` nose ' pointing downwind and the two arms pointing upwind , contrary to barchan dunes where the horns point downwind ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "vegetation covers most of the arms of parabolic dunes and a fraction of their nose depending on the activation degree of the dune , i.e. how fast the dune moves .",
    "an active parabolic dune has a sandy nose ( fig .  1 , left ) while an inactive one is almost totally covered by plants ( fig .  1",
    ", right ) .",
    "plants are typically placed along the lee size of the dune , which is protected from wind erosion . on the contrary ,",
    "the interior side exposed to the wind is devoid of vegetation .",
    "there , erosion is strong enough to prevent vegetation growth .",
    "= 0.5 mm     the migrating velocity of parabolic dunes is several times smaller than that of barchan dunes , and in general , they have an intermediate shape between fully active crescent dunes , like barchans , and completely inactive parabolic dunes . the activation degree of the parabolic dune is characterized by the vegetation cover pattern over it , which gives information about the areas of sand erosion and deposition pattern responsible for the motion of the dune .",
    "in this work we study the degree of activation of parabolic dunes in north - eastern brazil by direct measurements of the vegetation cover on them .",
    "we further present a method to extend the local information about vegetation cover to the whole dune by comparing the measured vegetation density cover with the gray scale level of high resolution satellite images .",
    "the empirical vegetation cover is finally quantitatively compared to the numerical solution of an established model for sand transport coupled with vegetation growth .",
    "along all the coast of the province of cear in the north - east of brazil ( fig .",
    "2 ) , sand dunes are totally or partially stabilized by vegetation . on one hand , the humid climate of the region , with intense precipitation during the rain season from february to july ( fig .",
    "3a ) , amplifies the role of vegetation as an active agent in the sandy landscape evolution .            on the other hand , the ubiquity of beaches plenty of sediments combined with a strong and highly uni - directional ese coastal wind ( fig .",
    "3b ) , create favorable conditions for the evolution of crescent sand dunes . furthermore , since the wind is stronger during the dry season ( fig .",
    "3 ) , both processes , the aeolian sediment transport and the biomass production , lead to a competing effect that completely reshapes the coastal landscape by the development of parabolic dunes through the inversion of barchans and their further deactivation by the vegetation growth .    in order to obtain information about the distribution of vegetation over coastal dunes , we went to fortaleza during the rain season to measure the shape of some parabolic dunes and the vegetation that covers them ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "these dunes are located in iguape , on the east of fortaleza , and pecem , taiba and paracuru , on the west ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the geographical coordinates of all points are recorded with gps and inserted in the digital dune map .    by using satellite landsat images and a topographic map we were able to select parabolic dunes with different degrees of inactivation and vegetation cover density .",
    "figures 4a , b , c , and d , show , in order of activation , the four measured parabolic dunes on the west coast of fortaleza , while figs .",
    "4e , f , and g , show the other three dunes from the iguape region , on the east coast . in general , the most active ones were located in taiba and iguape ( shown in figs .",
    "4d and g , respectively ) , while those in paracuru ( figs .",
    "4a and b ) were among the most inactive ones .",
    "since plants locally slow down the wind they can inhibit sand erosion as well as enhance sand accretion , as it is shown in fig .  5 . this dynamical effect exerted by plants on the wind , which is characterized by the drag force acting on them , is mainly determined by the frontal area density @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the total plant frontal area , i.e. the area facing the wind , of vegetation placed over a given sampling area @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , the vegetation cover over a dune is defined by the basal area density @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the total plant basal area , i.e. the area covering the soil , on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "= 0.5 mm    the distinction between both densities is crucial for the modeling of the vegetation effect over wind strength and thus sand transport @xcite . from fig .",
    "5 it is clear that plants act as obstacles that absorb part of the momentum transferred to the soil by the wind . as a result ,",
    "the total surface shear stress @xmath6 can be divided into two components , a shear stress @xmath7 acting on the vegetation and a shear stress @xmath8 acting on the sand grains . when plants are randomly distributed and the effective shelter area for one plant ( see fig .",
    "5 ) is proportional to its frontal area , the absorbed shear stress @xmath7 is proportional to the vegetation frontal area density @xmath9 times the undisturbed shear @xmath8 @xcite . using this",
    "it has been proposed that the fraction of the total stress acting on sand grains is given by    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the ratio of plant to surface drag coefficients and the constant @xmath12 is a model parameter that accounts for the non - uniformity of the surface shear stress @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath13 arises from the relation between the sandy and the total area .    although @xmath14 and @xmath9 can be calculated from direct measurements of the plants , in order to estimate the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 in eq .",
    "[ taus ] we need a far more complex procedure since in this case we have to measure the drag forces acting on the plants and the shear stresses on the sand surface with and without plants .",
    "we visited the field location during the rain season when winds are exceptionally weak .",
    "the vegetation cover over any of the measured dunes includes at least six different species .",
    "we focused on measuring the static quantities like densities , rather than the dynamic ones like @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in the section regarding the numerical solution of the model we use reported values from the literature for these two parameters @xcite",
    "the basal and frontal area density , @xmath14 and @xmath9 , can be indirectly estimated from the local number @xmath15 , basal area @xmath16 and frontal area @xmath17 of each species @xmath18 of plants over a characteristic area @xmath3 on the dune    @xmath19    figure 6 shows an sketch illustrating the local basal @xmath20 and frontal area @xmath21 of a given plant .",

    "we identify each plant @xmath18 the number of times @xmath15 it appears in a study area @xmath22 m@xmath23 and measure their characteristic length , height , number of leafs and leaf area ( fig .  7 , left )",
    ". some species of the typical vegetation we found are shown on the right side of fig .",
    "7 . using the morphological information of each species",
    "@xmath18 we measure the fraction of the total leaf area of each plant that covers the soil @xmath16 , and the fraction that faces the wind @xmath17 .",
    "in general , we found the same qualitative distribution of plants on all measured parabolic dunes ( fig .",
    "the area between the arms of the dune is totally covered by plants , while their density reduces on the windward side where sand erosion is very strong and increases once again on the lee side , where most of the sand deposition occurs .",

    "( [ rho ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) , the basal and frontal plant density at some particular points on the dunes .",
    "the first interesting result is that both densities are proportional to each other ( fig .",
    "9 ) with a proportionality constant @xmath24 with a reasonable dispersion in spite of the different dunes and types of vegetation .",
    "therefore , the plant basal density , also called cover density , @xmath14 , can be used to characterize the interaction between vegetation and the wind strength given by eq .",
    "this result agrees with measurements on creosote bush reported in wyatt et al .",

    "the gray - scale of the satellite image ( with a resolution 0.6 m / pixel ) suggests that vegetation density determines the image darkness .",
    "therefore , a crude approximation for the cover density at the dune is obtained by relating the density cover @xmath14 to its normalized image gray - scale value @xmath29 .",
    "this value is defined as    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the gray - scale value of a given point and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are defined by the normalization conditions @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",

    "we can estimate the density cover over the whole parabolic dune .",

    "the color - scale one identifies the zones where sand transport occurs .",
    "the windward side in the interior part is the most active part of the dune , as consequence of the erosion that prevents plants to grow . on the contrary",
    ", plants apparently can resist sand deposition since they accumulate clearly at the lee side and the crest of the dune .",
    "= 0.5 mm    another important conclusion is that the degree of activation of a dune apparently depends on its distance from the place where it was born .",
    "the three dunes in iguape ( fig .",
    "11 ) are deactivated according to their distance from the sea shore , the most active being the one nearest to the sea ( fig .",
    "11 , bottom right ) .",
    "similarly , the same occurs with other studied parabolic dunes .",
    "the numerical study of parabolic dunes has recently experienced new developments based on cellular automaton models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have recently proposed a continuum approach for the study of the competition process between vegetation growth and sand erosion @xcite . as was stated in the previous section",
    ", plants can locally slow down the wind , reducing erosion and enhancing sand accretion . on the other hand ,",
    "sand is eroded by strong winds denuding the roots of the plants and increasing the evaporation from deep layers @xcite . as a result",
    ", there is a coupling between the evolution of the sand surface and the vegetation that grows over it , controlled by the competition between the reduction of sand transport rate due to plants and their capacity to survive sand erosion and accretion @xcite ( the full model is presented in the appendix ) .",
    "= 0.5 mm    in order to compare with measurements we perform numerical calculations of parabolic dunes emerging from two different initial conditions .",
    "figure 12a , shows the parabolic dune resulting from the evolution of a barchan dune under active vegetation growth @xcite , while in fig .",
    "12b the parabolic dune emerges from the evolution of a blow - out , i.e. a spot of bare sand within a vegetated surface , which are common in coastal systems @xcite .",
    "from fig .  12 , it is clear that for both initial conditions a parabolic dune evolves with the characteristic vegetated arms pointing upwind and a sandy windward side .",
    "moreover , the convex and heavily eroded windward side finishes in a cut - edge vegetated crest , in sharp contrast with the barchan dune where the windward side is concave and the crest smoothly rounded .    as can be seen in fig .  12 , it is in the morphology , and not the vegetation distribution , where the two parabolic dunes evolving from different initial conditions differ most .",
    "although the dunes are of similar sizes , the windward side of the blow - out parabolic dune is more than twice the size of the windward side of the barchan - born parabolic dune .",
    "furthermore , the blow - out dune is more elongated than the corresponding barchan - born one and concentrates a higher sand volume in its ` nose ' .",
    "this can be understood from their respective evolutions : on one hand , the former dune is growing from a spot of bare sand in the vegetated surface and its volume is increasing due to the sediment that is continuously added on the vegetated surface @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the barchan - born parabolic dune has a total sand volume fixed from the beginning and since this volume is distributed over a growing surface , the parabolic dune is continuously shrinking , particularly its ` nose ' @xcite .    after comparing the simulated parabolic dunes ( fig .",
    "12 ) with the real ones from brazil ( fig .",
    "the similarity between the dune emerging from a blow - out and the measured ones seems evident .",
    "figure 13 depicts one dune from iguape and a simulated blow - out in their color - scale ( fig .",
    "13a and c ) and in the gray - scale corresponding to the quantitative vegetation cover density @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "13b and d ) .",
    "although the real dune has twice the size of the measured one , their morphology is very similar .",
    "examples of their similarities are : their relative length and width ; the position of the slip - face , that is sharper along the windward side than in the ` nose ' , and the gentile slope in the windward side and the front of the ` nose ' compared to the step lee side .",
    "regarding the distribution and density of the vegetation , both dunes also share strong similarities ( fig .",
    "13b and d ) .",
    "the distribution of the vegetation is clearly divided into two regions , the windward side almost devoid of plants and the vegetated lee side ( fig .",
    "as was discussed in the previous sections , this is a direct consequence of the competition between sand transport and vegetation growth , while on the heavily eroded windward side plant roots are uncovered and dried , on the lee side they survive sand accretion ( see fig .",
    "= 0.5 mm    = 0.5 mm    however , although the distribution of vegetation is qualitatively similar on both dunes , there is an important quantitative difference regarding the vegetation cover density : on the lee side of the simulated dune ( fig .",
    "13d ) the vegetation density reaches a far higher value , in fact very close to one , than in the real dune ( fig .",
    "this could be consequence of the way the effect of the vegetation on the sand transport is modeled .",
    "we assume that the shear stress partition , i.e. the wind slow down , is the only way plants can affect the sand transport , but there are other effects .",
    "for instance , plants act as physical barriers for the saltating grains that are carried by the wind .",
    "plants can trap them by direct collisions as well as by reducing the wind stress . in this case",
    ", a given vegetation density can be more effective in avoiding soil erosion than when one only considers the wind slow down .",
    "this can explain why the lee side on both dunes can have the same protecting role while having different vegetation density cover .",
    "we presented measurements on real parabolic dunes along the coast of brazil , concerning their shape and the vegetation cover on them .",
    "the vegetation cover over a dune was estimated by the number and size of plants in a characteristic area of the dune .",
    "to do so we identify the species of plants present on the dune and count the number of times they appear in the study area and measure their characteristic length , height and total leaf area .    by using the vegetation data we were able to calculate the plant cover density at particular points on the dunes and compare it with the gray scale of the satellite image .",
    "doing so we found a relation between both the vegetation cover density and the image gray - scale which leads us to estimate the density cover on the whole parabolic dune .",
    "then we compare the empirical vegetation cover data with the result of our simulations to validate quantitatively the distribution of vegetation over the dune .",
    "we conclude that the model indeed captures the essential aspects of the interaction between the different geomorphological agents , i.e. the wind , the surface and the vegetation .",
    "furthermore , it gives arguments in favor of the possible origin of parabolic dunes on the brazilian coast as coming from a blow - out , rather than from an early active coastal barchan dune system . through this",
    "we could estimate the degree of inactivation of the dune and reconstruct the previous dune history .",
    "we wish to thank labomar in fortaleza for the kind help during the field work .",
    "this study was supported by the volkswagenstiftung , the max plank prize and the dfg .",
    "the vegetated dune model consists of a system of continuum equations in two space dimensions that combines a description of the average turbulent wind shear force above the dune including the effect of vegetation , a continuum saltation model , which allows for saturation transients in the sand flux , and a continuum model for vegetation growth @xcite .",
    "the model can be sketched as follows : ( i ) first , the wind over the surface is calculated with the model of @xcite that describes the perturbation of the shear stress due to a smooth hill or dune .",
    "the fourier - transformed components of this perturbation are      where x and y mean , respectively , parallel and perpendicular to the wind direction , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are modified bessel functions , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the components of the wave vector @xmath47 , i.e. the coordinates in fourier space . @xmath48 is the fourier transform of the height profile , @xmath0 is the vertical velocity profile which is suitably non - dimensionalized , @xmath49 is the depth of the inner layer of the flow , and @xmath50 is the aerodynamic roughness .",
    "@xmath51 is a typical length scale of the hill or dune and is given by @xmath52 the mean wavelength of the fourier representation of the height profile .",
    "( ii ) next , the effect of the vegetation over the surface wind -shear stress partitioning- is calculated by eq .",
    "[ taus ] , which gives the fraction @xmath8 of total stress @xmath6 acting on the grains .",

    "if sand deposition leads to slopes that locally exceed the angle of repose , @xmath66 , the unstable surface relaxes through avalanches in the direction of the steepest descent , and the separation streamlines are introduced at the dune lee .",
    "each streamline is fitted by a third order polynomial connecting the brink with the ground at the reattachment point , and defining the  separation bubble \" , in which the wind and the flux are set to zero .",
