    "it is a pleasure to join the other authors of this special volume in celebrating the exceptionally wide variety of accomplishments in the distinguished career of professor girish s. agarwal .",
    "his impressive contributions as a theoretical physicist in quantum optics began with more than two dozen papers written in our department in rochester while still a student @xcite .",
    "it seems certain we will continue to benefit from many further interesting calculations and valuable insights in years to come .",
    "as coherence in quantum optical contexts has provided a constant source of fruitful inspiration to professor agarwal , we ve chosen the raman effect during fully coherent pulse propagation in three - level media as the topic of our contribution .",
    "this is an area that has prompted recent studies of his own @xcite , and is an area of wide theoretical and experimental activity at present .",
    "the door to this domain was opened by the famous work of mccall and hahn @xcite on two - level effects in ruby , in which they found theoretically and demonstrated experimentally the first optical soliton , the @xmath0 @xmath1 pulse of self - induced transparency ( sit ) .",
    "the coherent pulse propagation domain was gradually expanded to include pulse - pair propagation including three - level solitonic behavior @xcite , and the phenomenon of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) then emerged in the seminal work of harris @xcite .",
    "this has led to exciting discoveries including superluminal and ultra - slow pulse propagation .",
    "a consistent theoretical challenge , particularly in numerical modeling of short pulses , has been the effect of inhomogeneous broadening ( see some treatments in @xcite ) , and that is one element of the present paper .",
    "the raman effect was the first effect in physics of a specifically three - level character , and it is the basic model for essentially all experiments on lambda systems with two optical fields . our contribution can be considered as an examination of the _ cooperation _ between sit and the raman process , in contrast to the study by agarwal , dey and gauthier @xcite on the _ competition _ between eit and raman processes .",
    "of course the stimulated raman effect ( str ) has been actively studied for decades ( for an early review see @xcite ) .",
    "the str is a process by which a strong laser beam incident on the  pump \" transition of a three - level lambda system causes amplification of a weak  probe \" pulse injected at the stokes frequency ( see fig .",
    "traditionally str has been studied in atomic and molecular systems , but it has also been examined in bose condensates @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present analytic and numerical solutions to the coupled plane - wave maxwell - bloch system for stimulated raman scattering , without the usual assumption of undepleted pump pulse and with careful consideration of non - trivial changes in both the probe and pump pulse shapes due to propagation .",
    "we show in the fully coherent case ( pulses short enough to neglect homogeneous damping ) that complicated exact analytical results can be interpreted relatively easily , partly in sit terms , by introducing three  regimes \" of interaction .",
    "we show how the three regimes can be considered separately despite the tightly coupled nonlinear nature of the solutions .",
    "we consider the coherent propagation of two laser pulses in the @xmath2 direction in a medium of three level atoms in the lambda configuration as shown in fig .",
    "[ lambda ] .",
    "the electric field of the individual laser pulses can be written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the slowly varying envelope of the electric field , @xmath5 is the wavenumber , and @xmath6 is the frequency ( similarly for @xmath7 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system in the rotating wave picture is given by @xmath8 where h.c .",
    "refers to the hermitian conjugate of the previous operator .",
    "for the 1 - 3 transition we have @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the dipole moment , and @xmath11 , and corresponding notation for the 2 - 3 transition .",
    "note that the same @xmath12 is the one - photon detuning of each transition below resonance .",
    "we will describe each individual atom by its density matrix .",
    "the von neumann equation for the density matrix @xmath13 $ ] gives the following density matrix equations , with the use of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    ":    [ densitymatrix ] @xmath14    eqns .",
    "assume that the duration of the laser pulses is sufficiently short that the excited state decay rate @xmath15 can be neglected because we consider pulses with durations much shorter than @xmath16 .",
    "maxwell s equation for the field gives these two slowly varying envelope equations    [ maxwellequation ] @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the atom field coupling parameter , @xmath19 is the density of atoms , @xmath10 is the dipole moment matrix element between atomic states @xmath20 , and similarly @xmath21 for states @xmath22 .",
    "the notation @xmath23 accounts for inhomogeneous broadening by averaging over a range of detunings @xmath12 with the function @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the inhomogenous lifetime . for these equations",
    "to permit analytic solutions , one needs @xmath26 , which we will assume for the remainder of this paper .",
    "we solve eqns . and using a method developed by park and shin @xcite which is based on the bcklund transformation .",
    "we assume the initial density matrix of each atom is in an incoherent mixture of the two ground states , which is written in explicit form as @xmath27 the solution to the field envelopes is given by    [ pulsesolution ] @xmath28^{-1 } \\\\",
    "\\omega_{b } & = \\frac{4}{\\tau}\\bigg[2 \\textnormal { cosh}\\big(t/\\tau -bx\\big ) + \\exp\\big(t/\\tau + ( b-2a)x\\big)\\bigg]^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath29 is the nominal pulse width and @xmath30 is the retarded time , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are given by    [ lengthscale ] @xmath33    where the function @xmath34 is the beers absorption coefficient ( inverse beers length ) sometimes written @xmath35 in the case of doppler broadening : @xmath36    related solutions were previously given in @xcite and @xcite for the case where @xmath37 , and in the limit where inhomogeneous broadening is ignored . for the remainder of this paper we will be considering the opposite limit ,",
    "corresponding to large inhomogeneous broadening as in the familiar sit scenario @xcite , and @xmath38 will be the appropriate length unit for spatial pulse evolution .     ]",
    "the analytic pulse solutions are plotted in fig . [ fig.pulse ] .",
    "their solution formulas resist easy interpretation .",
    "however , they can be unravelled as follows . from the plots we see three distinct types of evolution . when only @xmath39 is significantly present we will speak of regime i ( frames 1 and 2 of fig .",
    "[ fig.pulse ] ) . during  transfer \" from pump to stokes",
    "when both pulses are substantial we have regime ii ( frames 3 - 5 ) . during regime",
    "iii only @xmath40 is significantly present ( frame 6 ) .",
    "we will isolate these three regimes analytically by looking at the asymptotic behavior of the pulse solutions.by considering @xmath41 we can look at regime i , and by considering @xmath42 we can look at regime iii .",
    "the transfer regime ii corresponds to @xmath43 .",
    "the area of a pulse is defined to be @xmath44 from which the pulse areas of solutions can be shown to be    [ pulsearea ] @xmath45 \\\\ \\theta_{b}(x ) & = \\frac{4}{h(-x)}\\big[\\tan^{-1}(h(-x))+\\cot^{-1}(h(-x))\\big]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 in the asymptotic limit @xmath41 it is straightforward to show that @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the opposite limit ,",
    "where @xmath49 , we have the opposite result , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    in regime",
    "i , eq . can be approximated by ( recalling the definitions of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath52 ) :    [ pulseinput ] @xmath53    which corresponds to a single @xmath0 sech - shaped pulse traveling at a group velocity of @xmath54 . in regime",
    "iii the pulse solutions are approximated by    [ pulseoutput ] @xmath55    which corresponds to a single @xmath0 sech - shaped pulse traveling at the group velocity of @xmath56 .",
    "thus in both regimes i and iii we see that the solution reduces to that of a @xmath0 area sech shaped pulse moving in a two - level medium .",
    "these asymptotic solutions correspond exactly to sit solitons @xcite .",
    "these two regimes are connected via the intermediate regime ii where the three level character of the medium causes the raman transfer process to occur , and the full solutions given in eq .",
    "must be used .",
    "to test the potential experimental relevance of the analytic solutions presented , we have to replace the infinite uniform medium assumed to this point by a more realistic medium with finite edges .",
    "we then solve eqns . and numerically .",
    "the analytic solution shapes and areas should not be assumed in advance , so at the entrance face to the medium we will inject gaussian input pulses given by    [ numinput ] @xmath57    where the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 give the input pulse areas . in the previous section we showed how the analytic solution can be separately interpreted in three distinct regimes by considering asymptotic solutions .",
    "we now chose input pulses for the numerical solution specifically to test the validity of our hypothesis that this process can be broken up into the three regimes defined above .     ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig.numpulse ] we plot the numerical solutions to eqs . and .",
    "we assume the medium is initially configured just as in fig .",
    "[ fig.pulse ] , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and that the medium is inhomogeneously broadening such that @xmath62 .",
    "we choose input pulse areas @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the numerical solution shows that the @xmath65 gaussian - shaped input pulse is reshaped into a @xmath0 sech - shaped pulse in regime i just as a pure two level sit description would suggest .",
    "the raman transfer process then takes place in regime ii , which amplifies the weak @xmath66 stokes pulse to a @xmath0 sech shaped pulse on the 2 to 3 transition .",
    "this final pulse in regime iii is an sit soliton , and will propagate without any dispersion or further modification .",
    "we also plot the numerically integrated pulse area in the bottom frame of fig .",
    "[ fig.area ] .",
    "one can clearly see the input pulse as it is reshaped into a sech shape is also changed to @xmath0 total area , just as predicted by standard sit theory .",
    "the area of the input pulses used in the numerical solutions is an experimentally controllable parameter .",
    "this value determines how many absorption lengths into the medium the pulses will travel in regime i before beginnning the transfer process in regime ii . the top frame of fig .",
    "[ fig.area ] shows the pulse areas given in eqns . .",
    "the input area of the weak pulse determines how far to the left of the asymptotes in fig .",
    "[ fig.area ] we start . in the numerical solution",
    "we choose an input pulse area for pulse b of @xmath64 which corresponds to @xmath67 in the analytic area formula given in eq . .",
    "thus within about 20 absorption lengths one would estimate the two pulses would be of roughly equal area . in fig .",
    "[ fig.numpulse ] we indeed see the pulses in frame 3 are almost of equal area , after traveling about 20 absorption lengths through the medium .",
    "this can be more clearly seen in the plots of the pulse areas in fig .",
    "[ fig.area ] where we see the pulses have equal area near @xmath68 as predicted .",
    "thus we can use eqns .",
    "along with the input area of the stokes pulse to determine where the raman transfer will occur even when the input pulses are of different shapes .     ]",
    "we have presented an analytic solution to the coupled maxwell - bloch equations that describe a raman transfer process between two sit solitons .",
    "this process can be broken up into three distinct regimes of which only one exhibits the characteristics of a three - level medium . in both asymptotic regimes",
    "the process can be considered as a two - level sit process .",
    "we also show how to estimate the distance that the pulses will propagate in each regime . by knowing the input areas of the stokes pulses",
    ", one can use the area formulas in eqns . to determine the propagation distance",
    "the pump pulse will propagate in regime i , as an sit soliton .",
    "the analytic pulse solutions in eqns",
    ". then describe the raman transfer process in regime ii .",
    "finally , once the transfer process has occurred , we show that the stokes pulse travels as an sit soliton in regime iii for the remainder of its propagation through the medium .",
