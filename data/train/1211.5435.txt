    "very recently , mizuguchi _ et al .",
    "_ discovered a new layered superconductor bi@xmath4o@xmath4s@xmath5 with @xmath6 k@xcite and other groups also reported similar materials , lao@xmath7f@xmath8bis@xmath0@xcite and ndo@xmath7f@xmath8bis@xmath0@xcite .",
    "these materials share some common features with both copper - based and iron - based high temperature superconductors .",
    "the electronic properties of these materials are determined by the bis@xmath0 layer@xcite , similar to the cuo@xmath0 layer in cuprates or the fe@xmath0an@xmath0(an = p , as , se , te ) layer in iron - based superconductors .",
    "electron doping to the bis@xmath0 layer can induce superconductivity .",
    "for example , in lao@xmath7f@xmath8bis@xmath0 , the partial replacement of o by f provides electron doping and induces superconductivity .",
    "some properties in the superconducting ( sc ) state are also shown to be unconventional although it is too early to make a conclusive statement@xcite .",
    "a number of studies appear shortly after the discovery of bis@xmath0 layered superconductor@xcite .",
    "the basic band structure of these materials has been calculated by first principle calculation . the conduction band in the bis@xmath0 layer is mainly attributed to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 orbits of bi@xcite .",
    "neglecting the interlayer coupling and states away from fermi surface , usui _ _ et al.__@xcite proposed a two - orbital model , in which only @xmath9 and @xmath10 orbitals are included , to describe the band structure . a good fermi - surface nesting and two quasi - one - dimensional bands",
    "have been found in lao@xmath7f@xmath8bis@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the importance of fermi surface nesting has been emphasized in ref .  .",
    "because of the low @xmath11 and the extended @xmath12-orbitals in bis@xmath0 layered materials , electron - phonon coupling was suggested to play the main role in the cooper pairing@xcite .",
    "however , because electron - electron correlation generally is more important in a low dimensional system , the correlation effect might play an important role in driving superconductivity even if the @xmath12-orbitals of bi are much less localized compared with @xmath2-orbitals in cuprates and iron - based superconductors@xcite .",
    "experimentally it has also been proposed in ref .   that the sc pairing is strong and exceeds the limit of the phonon mediated picture .",
    "the correlation effect , therefore , seems to be a good candidate responsible for the sc pairing in these materials .    in the two - orbital model based on the @xmath12-orbitals of bi ,",
    "the quasi - one dimensional bands are generated through the @xmath12-orbitals of s@xcite .",
    "if electron - electron correlation is important , the superexchange mechanism can naturally result in a next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) antiferromagnetic ( afm ) exchange coupling .",
    "although the existence of afm fluctuation is still needed to be justified experimentally , theoretically it is legitimate to search for the consequence of possible correlation effect in these materials .    in this paper , we investigate the pairing symmetry of layered bis@xmath0 compounds by assuming that electron - electron correlation is still important so that the pairing is rather short range . under the assumption that the short range pairing stems from short afm exchange couplings , we find that the extended @xmath1-wave pairing symmetry always wins over @xmath2-wave .",
    "such result is very similar to the case in iron - based superconductors@xcite .",
    "we find that the pairing strength is peaked around the doping level @xmath3 , which is also consistent with experimental observation .",
    "the pairing symmetry is very robust against spin - orbital coupling because it is mainly determined by the structure of fermi surfaces .",
    "the extended @xmath1-wave pairing can be tested by measuring the gap distributions at different fermi surfaces .",
    "laobis@xmath13 is an indirect semiconductor .",
    "its band gap is about 0.82 ev , which is much larger than the superconducting gap , @xmath14 k. the simplest effective model is a two - orbital model constructed by @xmath15 and @xmath16 orbitals of bi .",
    "as shown in band structure of lao@xmath17f@xmath17bis@xmath13 from first principle calculation@xcite , the four lowest conduction bands are splitted slightly .",
    "the splitting is so small compared with their band width so that the low energy physics can be captured by a two dimensional two - orbital model that ignores the coupling between bis@xmath13 layers .",
    "we adopt the band structure proposed in ref .",
    ", in which the noninteracting hamiltonian reads @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 are creation operators for electrons with spin @xmath21 in the two orbitals @xmath22 aligned along _",
    "diagonal _ directions in bi unit cell and @xmath23 the hopping parameters in eq .",
    "[ eq2 ] are given by @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 in units of ev .",
    "it is clear from these parameters that the material is quasi - one dimensional because the value of @xmath32 is almost an order of magnitude larger than other hopping parameters .",
    "the model has a lifshitz transition at electron doping @xmath33 and @xmath34 where the fermi surface topologies are changed .",
    "if the electron - electron correlation effect can not be ignored , the hopping through the @xmath12-orbitals of s would naturally lead to an afm exchange coupling between two nnn sites of bi for the above two - orbital models . taking the standard approach , in general ,",
    "we can write the interacting hamiltonian as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the local spin operator , @xmath37 is the local density operator , @xmath38 denotes a pair of nnn sites , @xmath39 is orbital index and we use @xmath40 to label @xmath41 and @xmath42 orbitals , respectively .",
    "owing to the quasi - one dimensional property , the afm nnn coupling can take two independent values such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 , keeping c@xmath4 symmetry unbroken , with @xmath45 expected to dominate over other exchange parameters . if we rewrite the interaction term in momentum space , @xmath46    in general , the presence of electron - electron correlation can also significantly renormalize the bare band structure . in the strong coupling limit",
    ", the band width renormalization strongly depends on doping .",
    "however , here since the correlation is , at most , moderate , we assume that the renormalization does not vary significantly as the function of doping .",
    "under such an assumption , we can use standard mean - field approximation to obtain the sc state and its favored pairing symmetry .",
    "this approach has been used to study iron - based superconductors where the correlation is most likely around intermediate coupling strength . under mean - field approximation ,",
    "the total hamiltonian can be simplified as @xmath47 where @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52,\\\\ \\delta_{\\alpha}^\\prime & = & \\left[\\frac{-2}{n}j_{2,\\alpha}^\\prime\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}^\\prime } d_{\\mathbf{k}^\\prime,\\uparrow,\\alpha}\\cos(k_{x}^\\prime - k_{y}^\\prime)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since we only consider spin singlet pairing , there are two possible pairing symmetries . in bis2 layered materials",

    "s - wave pairing is defined if the phase of the order parameter has no change under c4 rotation and if the phase changes , then the system is in d - wave pairing . in real space , which can be obtained from eq.8,9 by fourier transformation . under c4 rotation , @xmath53 is changed into @xmath54 and @xmath55 into @xmath56 .",
    "thus , in our definition , s - wave pairing is taken if @xmath57 and @xmath58 while the @xmath2-wave pairing is chosen if @xmath59 .",

    "[ freeenergy ] , we plot the free energy of @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave pairing states in @xmath67 plane with @xmath68 electron doping . in all plotting region , the extended @xmath1-wave is favored .",
    "the reason that the extended @xmath1-wave is favored over the @xmath2-wave can be roughly understood by the overlap between the absolute value of the pairing gap form factor with the fermi surface topologies as shown in ref .  .",
    "for simplicity , we consider the case that only @xmath45 exists .",
    "we first assume the @xmath1-wave and @xmath2-wave have the same pairing amplitude , then the overlap between sc gap and fermi surface is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the sc gap form factor over the whole fermi surface .",
    "the pairing channel is the one that has largest overlap .",
    "[ overlap051 ] illustrates the sc gap distribution over the entire fermi surface with @xmath69 at doping @xmath70 .",
    "the gap distributions of @xmath1- and @xmath2-wave pairing states are the same except the region near the nodes of @xmath2-wave state .",
    "it s obvious that the overlap of @xmath1-wave pairing state is larger than that of @xmath2-wave pairing state .",
    "our calculation also shows that the @xmath1-wave pairing does not co - exist with @xmath2-wave pairing . as shown in fig .",

    "the density of states ( dos ) in sc ground state : ( b ) for @xmath1-wave pairing state and ( d ) for @xmath2-wave pairing state .",

    "( b ) @xmath76 as a function of doping at @xmath80,height=264 ]    the extended @xmath1-wave pairing is very robust against the variation of parameters .",
    "this is because the quasi - one dimensional nature in the band structure results in the dominant pairing channel which is mainly from the @xmath45 term .",
    "for example , even we increase @xmath81 , the amplitude of pairing induced by @xmath82 is still much larger than that by @xmath77 , as shown fig .",
    "[ dx_muj2 ] ( a ) .",
    "@xmath76 is five times of @xmath78 when @xmath83 and ten times when @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , the optimal doping to achieve the highest @xmath11 is around 0.5 . therefore ,",
    "given @xmath45 , we will obtain a superconducting dome with optimal @xmath11 at @xmath85 as shown in fig .",
    "[ dx_muj2 ] ( b ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the experimental results .",
    "experimentally , the optimal doping of lao@xmath7f@xmath86bis@xmath0 is suggested to be @xmath87 per bi atom@xcite and @xmath88 per bi atom for ndo@xmath7f@xmath86bis@xmath0@xcite . in the later case , the actual value may be higher because of the existence of impurity phases@xcite .",
    "the robustness of the extended @xmath1-wave is preserved even if we include other short range afm couplings such as nearest - neighbor ( nn ) intra - orbital and inter - orbital ones or spin - orbital coupling ( soc ) . in the mean - field level",
    ", the nn intra - orbital afm coupling favors @xmath89 pairing symmetry . as shown in fig .",
    "[ j1j2 ] , as soon as @xmath45 is larger than the nn coupling @xmath90 , the extended @xmath1-wave dominates .",
    "the nn inter - orbital afm coupling can induce four types of pairing symmetry , inter - orbital @xmath91 , inter - orbital @xmath89 and inter - orbital @xmath92 .",
    "also , in the mean - field level , only inter - orbital @xmath89 pairing symmetry is favored by nn inter - orbital coupling and the extended @xmath1-wave induce by @xmath45 dominates while @xmath45 is larger than the nn inter - orbital afm coupling @xmath93 , as shown in fig.[j2j1inter ] .",
    "the time reversal symmetry breaking inter - orbital @xmath92 does not exist in mean - field level .",
    "furthermore , the extended @xmath1-wave is also very robust against spin - orbital coupling .",
    "because of the absence of @xmath94 orbital contribution near fermi surfaces , the onsite soc hamiltonian is given by @xmath95 . by fitting the first principle band structure with soc with the two - band model , we get @xmath96 ev .",
    "however , even if this soc appears to be strong , it only lifts the degeneracy at x and @xmath97 points and makes no significant adjustment on fermi surfaces .",
    "we find that the extended @xmath1-wave is hardly affected .",
    "an only visible effect is that the soc slightly increase the optimal doping level when we repeat the above mean - field calculation in the presence of soc .",

    "[ overlap051 ] , [ overlap025 ] and [ overlap069 ] . for the extended @xmath1-wave , while the sc gap is developed throughout the fermi surfaces , the gap has significant variations .",
