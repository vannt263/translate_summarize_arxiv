    "a power - law spectrum and a disk blackbody spectrum have similar luminosities in the 0.310 kev band , but will be quite different in the energy range up to 100 kev . since our data are only effective below 10 kev , an approximation with a single power - law spectrum is adequate . in ngc 1399 , we selected only sources that were located at least 20 arcsec off the nucleus and within the d25 circle ( 6.9 arcmin in diameter from the rc3 catalog ) . in the antennae",
    ", we selected only sources in the active starforming region , which is bounded by a 1.4 arcmin radius circle .    since the absolute astrometry accuracy of chandra is 0.6 arcsec , which is worse than the angular resolution , a correction for the aspect is necessary between observations before the same region could be applied in different observations for source selection . for ngc 1399 , we selected all detected sources ( @xmath12 ) in the region of interest as defined above in different observations . then we took observation ( b ) as a reference and searched in other observations for matched sources that were located within 1 arcsec of the selected source in ( b ) . a pointing offset",

    "a similar correction was applied to observations of the antennae with observation ( i ) used as the reference .      to examine source variability between observations ,",
    "luminosity - luminosity ( l - l ) diagrams are presented for both galaxies .",

    "for an unmatched source in the list , we placed the same elliptical region in the other observation and calculated the net counts by subtracting the background level , estimated with wavdetect , from the total counts encircled by the ellipse .",

    "[ fig : lla ] shows l - l diagrams for the antennae sources between observation ( i ) and all others .",
    "we emphasize that we calculate luminosity from counting rate assuming a fixed spectrum .",
    "our quoted luminosities are the counting rate multiplied by a roughly constant factor ( the factor is not exactly constant because different instrument modes were used for ngc 1399 and the detector response changed slowly for the antennae ) .",
    "because we are investigating the variability of individual sources , our comparisons of luminosities is very similar to a comparison of counting rates .",
    "if the assumed spectra form for a given source is incorrect , then the luminosities will be incorrect , but all luminosities for any individual source would be shifted by the same factor ( if the spectral shape of an individual source varies between observations , then that would be evidence for variability ) .",
    "we choose to present luminosities instead of count rates , because the former are easier to compare with measurements of other sources .",
    "we note that an estimate of the true luminosity depends on the spectral form assumed and the energy band used .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the sources is likely larger than our quoted values , since emission is likely present both above and below the 0.3 - 10  kev band . to determine the magnitude of the uncertainty on the luminosity in our chosen energy band , we fit each source that has enough photons with an absorbed power - law and measured its intrinsic luminosity ( the photon index and column density",
    "are allowed to vary ; see details in section  [ sec : spec ] ) .",
    "then we fit the spectrum and obtained another estimate of the luminosity by fixing the absorption to the galactic value and the photon index to 1.5 .",
    "the ratio between these two luminosities varies between 0.6@xmath61.2 for bright x - ray sources in ngc 1399 and 1@xmath62 in the antennae .",
    "therefore , a bilateral systematic error of @xmath15 is derived .",
    "we also checked with xspec that the systematic error of @xmath15 could cover spectral changes from @xmath16 for a single power - law spectrum , @xmath17 kev for a single disk blackbody spectrum , or a reasonable combination of them ; the column density was fixed at the galactic value for ngc 1399 but was varied from the galactic value to 10@xmath18 @xmath19 for the antennae .",
    "that means this systematic error is valid for black hole binaries at most spectral states that have been observed in our galaxy .",
    "the systematic error is shown as two dashed lines in the l - l diagram .",
    "sources lying between the two dashed lines are considered constant within the accuracy of our measurement .",
    "lightcurves for the ulxs , which we define as having a luminosity in 0.3 - 10 kev band above @xmath20 ergs s@xmath1 in at least one observation , and for the six most variable sources are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lcn ] for ngc 1399 and in fig .",
    "[ fig : lca ] for the antennae .",
    "the variability is defined as the maximum ratio in luminosities , which could be a number with a standard error if the lowest luminosity is detected or a 90% lower bound if the lowest luminosity is an upper limit .",
    "the luminosities in the lightcurves are derived slightly differently than those in the l - l diagram .",
    "first we generate a complete source list , which is based on detected sources in the reference observation ( ( b ) or ( i ) ) , as well as sources only detected in other observations .",
    "we place the same circular region for a given source in all observations and calculate the luminosity .",
    "this difference in technique causes a mild difference with the luminosities in the l - l diagrams but is consistent within the errors .",

    "for all the x - ray sources in ngc 1399 and the antennae , we calculated their variability defined as described above .",

    "the color of the optical counterpart ( @xmath21 , washington @xmath22 and kron @xmath23 , @xcite ) for this source is inconsistent with that of a globular cluster , but the color may be affected by a defect in the @xmath23-band image ( t. richtler private communication ) . of the other 9 variable sources , only two have optical counterparts within @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the majority of the variable sources are not associated with globular clusters .",

    "we examined two long observations spaced by similar periods , i.e. , ( b ) and ( g ) for ngc 1399 and ( i ) and ( vii ) for the antennae , to check if the difference in variability between ngc 1399 and the antennae still persists when only observations with detection thresholds well below our luminosity cutoff are used .",
    "we found that 7 of the 63 bright sources in ngc 1399 and 4 of the 15 bright sources in the antennae are variable .",

    "they predicted outburst durations similar to what we find for ngc 1399 .",
    "for the sources associated with globular clusters , another possibility is that the companion stars are initially isolated stars which are captured by the black hole after evolving to the giant phase .",
    "the capture cross - section is enhanced for stars in the giant phase .",
    "however , grs 1915@xmath3105 shows strong variability on short time scales , which we do not observe from the bright x - ray sources in ngc 1399 .",
    "the sensitivity of chandra to short timescale variability is limited due to the low counting rate , but our detection of short timescale variability from sources in the antennae ( with comparable counting rates ) indicates that similar flares would have been detected from the ngc 1399 sources .",
    "the short timescale variability of sources in ngc 1399 should be investigated in more detail with new observations .",
    "@xcite has suggested that the bright x - ray sources in ngc 1399 may be neutron stars accreting from white dwarf companions in ultracompact binaries , similar to 4u 1820@xmath2530 .",
    "the variability of 4u 1820@xmath2530 is similar to the ngc 1399 bright sources .",
    "hence , neutron star ultracompact binaries may account for some or all of the bright sources if mildly super - eddington ( apparent ) luminosities can be achieved .",
    "however , the short lifetimes expected for the high accretion rates required given the very low - mass companions ( @xmath52 ) make it unlikely that the ulxs in ngc 1399 are neutron star ultracompact binaries .",
    "another possible interpretation of the bright sources is that they are neutron - star binaries similar to the neutron - star x - ray binaries known as z sources .",
    "z sources are persistent with variability similar to that seen from the ngc 1399 sources .",
    "again , mildly super - eddington ( apparent ) luminosities would be required to produce the dimmest of the bright sources and such objects are unlikely to explain the ulxs .",
    "interestingly , @xcite suggested that the z sources have giant star companions with mass loss driven by nuclear evolution .",
    "this would make the systems the neutron star analogs of black hole / giant star binaries such as grs 1915@xmath3105 .",
    "the three most luminous x - ray sources in ngc 1399 are interesting .",
    "the brightest one , psx-1 , has a hard spectrum ( @xmath53 ) , little variability ( @xmath54 ) , and a high luminosity around @xmath4 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "the spectrum indicates the source is not in its high / soft state ( @xmath55 ) but at the hard extreme of the low / hard state ( @xmath56 ) @xcite .",
    "the low variability indicates that the source is probably not relativistically beamed @xcite , because relativistically beamed sources are expected to be highly variable .",
    "this source is associated with a bright gc with @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xcite , which means it is unlikely to be a background agn .",
    "a huge number of sources would be required to explain the emission as a collection of neutron star or black hole x - ray binaries .",
    "if the source is an imbh in the low state , its practically constant luminosity is reasonable if compared to the long - term behavior of m82 x-1 , which varies in luminosity by a factor of 2 - 3 @xcite and shows a hard spectrum with a power - law index @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "ngc 1399 psx-2 and psx-4 display typical behaviors of black holes in the high / soft state .",
    "psx-2 is associated with a bright gc ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) but psx-4 is not .",
    "the plausible cool disk ( @xmath62 kev ) emission is consistent with the soft spectral index ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "their low variability ( @xmath64 for psx-2 and @xmath65 for psx-4 ) is suggestive of some galactic black holes in the high state , but no galactic source has been found to remain in the high state for four years @xcite . the cool disk has been a useful probe in finding imbh candidates @xcite .",
    "however , their disk temperatures are somewhat higher than most imbh candidates , and their luminosities ( @xmath66 ergs s@xmath1 ) are also around the lower bound of those candidates @xcite .",
    "these sources do not have high mass companion stars to produce geometrically beamed emission as suggested by @xcite .",
    "therefore , it could be possible that these two sources are 10@xmath6100@xmath7 black holes emitting at the high state if the disk components are true . one possible way to determine the reality of the disk emission is an accurate measurement of the column density , since these two sources , in particular psx-2 , show significantly higher intrinsic absorption if modeled by a single power - law spectrum .",
    "the bright x - ray sources in the antennae are variable .",
    "this suggests that they are black hole binaries and accreting from massive stars to produce unstable disks @xcite .",
    "they are not as variable as black hole lmxbs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vfun ] ) . considering the variability together with their high luminosity",
    ", we suggest they are hmxbs accreting via roche - lobe overflow . there is no disk emission found in any of the 4 ulxs .",
    "the most luminous source , x-16 , manifests a very hard spectra ( @xmath67 ) and has strong variability with a change of luminosity of @xmath610 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alg ] ) .",
    "the source could be an imbh with a mass of a few hundred to thousand @xmath7 emitting at the hard state .",
    "the x - ray behavior is also consistent with a relativistically beamed jet pointing at us , but @xcite pointed out that there is no radio emission found from any ulx in the antennae .",
    "it is interesting that none of the ulxs shows the very soft spectrum normally seen in ulxs in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "we note that x-37 was reported to have a soft component in its spectrum , but has been subsequently identified as a background agn . x-11 and x-42 are likely to be in the hard state ( @xmath68 ) , x-44 looks like it is between the hard and soft states ( @xmath69 ) . a plausible correlation ( @xmath70 ) is found in x-11 between luminosity and @xmath5 , which shows similar behaviors as stellar mass black holes , but we should be cautious because of the weak correlation coefficient .",
    "the x - ray properties of these three sources are consistent with hmxbs , but whether they are imbhs or @xmath620@xmath7 black holes emitting in near or super eddington luminosities is still unclear .",
