    "theoretical developments at the interface between high energy physics and cosmology led , about twenty five years ago , to a tremendous change in our view and understanding of the early universe , the so - called primordial inflation @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review ) . similarly to the current concept of dark energy @xcite , widely used nowadays to explain present cosmic acceleration , the idea of inflation , a period of rapid expansion of the cosmic scale factor in the very early universe , became the favorite paradigm for explaining both the causal origin of structure formation and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies . from the observational side",
    ", an inflationary epoch also provides a natural explanation of why the universe is nearly flat ( @xmath2 ) , as evidenced by the combination of the position of the first acoustic peak of the cmb power spectrum and the current value of the hubble parameter @xcite .    extending our parallel with dark energy",
    ", we must emphasize that there is also considerable freedom in modeling the field potential responsible for the primordial inflationary epoch .",
    "several potentials , ranging from single power - laws , as the quartic @xmath3 or the quadratic chaotic @xmath4 types , to more elaborated forms , have been largely explored in the literature @xcite .",
    "another simple and interesting possibility is the one given by the usual exponential function , i.e. , @xmath5 as originally investigated in refs .",
    "scalar fields with simple exponential potentials occur in fact quite generically in certain kinds of particle physics theories .",
    "examples extend from supergravity and superstrings theories , as the well - studied salam - sezgin model @xcite , gravitational theories with high derivative terms @xcite , kaluza - klein theories in which extra dimensions are compactified to produce our 4-dimensional world , to many others ( see @xcite for more details ) .    in this _",

    "quasi_-exponential ( power - law ) behavior , for @xmath18 the usual potential ( [ potexp ] ) is fully recovered .",
    "in what follows , we analyze the inflationary scenario that arises from ( [ potexpg ] ) within the slow - roll approximation .",
    "we show that this single scalar field model admits a wider range of solutions than do conventional exponential scenarios , and seems to fit the current observational constraints from cmb and large - scale structure ( lss ) experiments .",
    "let us first consider a single scalar field model whose action is given by [ action ] s = d^4 x .",
    "( throughout this paper we work in units where the planck mass @xmath19 ) . in this background ,",
    "the stress - energy conservation equation for the field can be expressed as @xmath20 , where dots denote derivative with respect to time and primes with respect to the field @xmath17 . in the",
    "so - called _ slow - roll _ approximation , the evolution of the field is dominated by the drag from the cosmological expansion , so that @xmath21 or , equivalently , @xmath22 . with these simplifications , the _ slow - roll _ regime can be expressed in terms of the _ slow - roll _ parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 , i.e. , @xcite [ epsilon ] ( ) ( vv)^2 , and [ eta ] ( ) , where @xmath25^{1/2}$ ] is the hubble parameter . in order to work properly , the inflationary potential must have a sufficiently small slope , so that @xmath26 , @xmath27 , which is consistent with the approximation for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    by substituting our generalized potential ( [ potexpg ] ) into the above equations , we obtain    @xmath30 ^ 2}\\ ; , \\ ] ]    @xmath31 ^ 2}\\ ; , \\ ] ]    which reduce to the usual exponential result @xmath32 in the limit @xmath14 . from eq .",

    "( [ ns])-([rr ] ) , we obtain the contributions of the scalar and tensor perturbations as a function of @xmath43 , so that we can compare the model s predictions for these quantities with current observational limits .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that bounds on the gravitational wave background provide constraints on the maximum number of _ e - folds _ , i.e. , @xmath44 @xcite . in the subsequent discussions",
    ", however , we consider the interval @xmath1 , as well argued in ref . @xcite .",
    "figures ( 1b ) and ( 1c ) show the @xmath45 plane for three different values of the number of _ e - folds _ corresponding to the range @xmath1 and characteristic values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "note that , the larger the energy scale the larger the positive interval of the parameter @xmath48 that is compatible with the current bounds on @xmath36 from wmap3 plus the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , i.e. , @xmath49 ( 95.4% c.l . ) @xcite ( clearly an opposite dependence is also found between the remaining number of _ e - folds _ and the positive interval for @xmath48 ) .",
    "note also that , for negative values of @xmath48 , a scale - invariant spectrum ( @xmath50 ) is possible , which seems to be in agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath51 at 95.4% c.l . ) . in both figures ,",
    "the former bounds on @xmath36 are represented by shadowed areas .",
    "the @xmath52 plane is displayed in figure 2 for some selected values of the parameter @xmath48 .",
    "for the portion of this plane compatible with current bounds on @xmath37 from wmap3 plus sdss , i.e. , @xmath53 ( at 95.4% c.l . ) @xcite , a considerable interval ( which includes negative and positive values ) of @xmath48 is in agreement with the current limits on @xmath36 discussed above .",
    "similarly to the intermediate inflationary scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig . 1 of this reference ) , and as expected from our eq .",
    "( [ rr ] ) , a harrison - zeldovich spectrum ( @xmath50 and @xmath54 ) is also a prediction of this scenario regardless of the value of @xmath48 . in terms of the parameter @xmath48 ,",
    "note that both the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( [ rr ] ) approaches zero as @xmath55 since , from eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) , @xmath56 .    0.1 in      the running of the spectral index in inflationary models , to lowest order in slow - roll , is given by @xcite @xmath57 where [ xi ] ^2 ( ) = - ( 2)^ .",
    "by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) , ( [ eta ] ) and ( [ ns ] ) into the above expressions we obtain a relation between the spectral index and its running , i.e. , @xmath58 note that the above relation has both the possibilities for negative and positive running .",
    "for instance , for values of @xmath48 lying in the open negative interval @xmath59 the running is always positive ( 0 for @xmath50 ) , which seems to be disfavored by the wmap3 data ( @xmath60 at 95.4% c.l . ) but not ruled out by a joint analysis involving wmap3 and sdss ( @xmath61 at 95.4% c.l . )",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for all other values of @xmath48 out of the above interval , a prediction for a negative running is found ( see figure 3 ) . note also that , for values of the spectral index @xmath62 , as indicated by current observations @xcite",
    ", all models approach @xmath63 which , although in full agreement with the bounds above , makes a distinction between different scenarios difficult from the observational viewpoint .",
    "primordial inflation constitutes one of the best and most successful examples of physics at the interface between particle physics and cosmology , with a tremendous consequences on our view and understanding of the early universe . in this paper",
    ", we have investigated some cosmological consequences of a new inflationary scenario driven by a generalized exponential potential of the type @xmath64 [ eq.([potexpg ] ) ] . as discussed in sec .",
    "i , this generalized potential behaves as a simple power - law for all values of @xmath16 and is an exact exponential function for @xmath18 . within the _ slow - roll _ approximation",
    "we have calculated the main observable quantities , such as the spectral index , its running and the ratio of tensor - to - scalar perturbations and shown that , even for values of the number of _ e - folds _ in the restrictive interval @xmath1 @xcite , the predictions of the model is in good agreement with current bounds on these parameters from cmb and lss observations , as given in refs .",
