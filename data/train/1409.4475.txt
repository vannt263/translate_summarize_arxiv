    "<S> a question whether there exists an interaction between the spins of the endohedral atom @xmath0@c@xmath1 and the properties of the confining shell which might affect the alignment of , or manipulation by , the spins for building a register for a quantum computer is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that an effect , termed the ` c@xmath1 spin - charging ' effect , can occur in endohedral atoms and would affect the operation of a quantum register . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is exemplified by choosing the @xmath2 ( cr and mn ) and @xmath3 ( mo and tc ) transition metal atoms as well as a rare - earth eu atom as the case study . </S>",
    "<S> a class of high - spin atoms which are less suitable for building a quantum register is , thus , identified .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of a non - zero spin atom confined by c@xmath1 ( referred to as the endohedral @xmath0@c@xmath1 atom ) as the building block of the register for a quantum computer was proposed by harneit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the higher the spin of the atom , the better . </S>",
    "<S> confined atoms then must be atoms with one or more multielectron semifilled subshells in their configuration whose electron spins are aligned . </S>",
    "<S> the study by harneit @xcite focused on the use of a semifilled shell n(@xmath4c@xmath1 atom . </S>",
    "<S> the general idea for building the register for a quantum computer depends on the freedom to align the spin of the encapsulated atom , on the ability of the c@xmath1 confining cage to screen the spins from the influence of unwanted decohering fields and on the ability to write ( read ) to ( from ) an assembly of confined atoms held together as an array .    </S>",
    "<S> it is , therefore , interesting to explore whether , in fact , the freedom to align the spins of encapsulated atoms exists independently of the properties of a confining shell and whether external fields are able to perturb this alignment . </S>",
    "<S> the latter question has already been addressed theoretically by connerade and solovyov and amusia and baltenkov @xcite who studied the properties of a spherical c@xmath1 cage and showed under what conditions the c@xmath1 screening of an external field remains effective . </S>",
    "<S> the former of the two questions is addressed in the present paper by accounting for an effect termed the ` c@xmath1 spin - charging effect ' .    </S>",
    "<S> the c@xmath1 spin - charging effect was recently uncovered as a by - product by dolmatov @xcite in the study of @xmath5 electron elastic scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the quintessence of the effect is that both the electron spin - up @xmath6 and spin - down @xmath7 functions of a high spin encapsulated atom @xmath0 , such as an atom with one or more multielectron semifilled subshells in its configuration , may be drawn noticeably , but very differently , into the region of the c@xmath1 wall . </S>",
    "<S> this results in loading the c@xmath1 cage with electron density of a preferred spin orientation . naturally , the effect is accompanied by the loss of some electron spin - density localized on the confined atom @xmath0 itself . clearly , the phenomenon is potentially important for the proposed realization of an @xmath0@c@xmath1 register for a quantum computer . </S>",
    "<S> it is the ultimate aim of the present paper to delineate the spin - charging effect more precisely for this purpose . to meet this goal , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2- , @xmath3- and @xmath8-semifilled shell cr( ... @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) , mn( ... @xmath11 , @xmath12 , mo( ... @xmath13 , @xmath10 ) , tc( ... @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and eu( ... @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) </S>",
    "<S> atoms encapsulated inside c@xmath1 are chosen for the completeness of the case study .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we briefly outline the methodology to calculate the c@xmath1 spin - charging effect in an endohedral semifilled shell atom , @xmath0@c@xmath1 .    a convenient way to account for the structure of a semifilled shell atom is provided by the spin - polarized hartree - fock approximation ( sphf ) developed by slater @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sphf accounts for the fact that spins of all electrons in a semifilled subshell of the atom ( e.g. , in the @xmath18 subshell of mn ) are co - directed , in accordance with hund s rule , say , all pointing upward </S>",
    "<S> . this results in splitting of a closed @xmath19 subshell in the atom into two semifilled subshells of opposite spin orientations , @xmath20@xmath21 and @xmath20@xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in view of the presence of exchange interaction between @xmath23@xmath21 electrons with only spin - up electrons in the original semifilled subshell of the atom ( like the @xmath18@xmath21 subshell in the mn atom ) but absence of such for @xmath23@xmath22 electrons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the sphf configurations of cr , mn , mo , tc and eu are as follows : cr( ... @xmath24@xmath21@xmath24@xmath22@xmath25@xmath21@xmath26@xmath21 , @xmath27s ) , mn( ... @xmath24@xmath21@xmath24@xmath22@xmath25@xmath21@xmath26@xmath21@xmath28@xmath22 , @xmath29s ) , mo( ... @xmath30@xmath21@xmath30@xmath22@xmath31@xmath21@xmath32@xmath21 , @xmath27s ) , tc( ... @xmath30@xmath21@xmath30@xmath22@xmath31@xmath21@xmath32@xmath21@xmath32@xmath22 , @xmath29s ) and eu( ... @xmath31@xmath21@xmath31@xmath22@xmath33@xmath21 ... @xmath34@xmath21@xmath35@xmath22 , @xmath36s ) . </S>",
    "<S> sphf equations for the ground state of a semifilled shell atom differ from ordinary hf equations for closed shell atoms by accounting for exchange interaction only between electrons with the same spin orientation ( @xmath21 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 , @xmath22 ) @xcite . to model a @xmath0@c@xmath1 atom , we account for the presence of the c@xmath1 cage by adding a rectangular ( in the radial coordinate @xmath37 ) potential well @xmath38 of a finite width @xmath39 , depth @xmath40 and inner radius @xmath41 to the hf ( sphf ) equations @xcite , as in many of other studies , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein :    @xmath42    in the literature , some inconsistency is present in choosing the magnitudes of @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the c@xmath1 phenomenological potential ( [ swp ] ) , cp . , </S>",
    "<S> e.g. , references @xcite with each other . in the present paper , </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , we choose @xmath43 au ( which is twice of the covalent radius of carbon ) , @xmath44 au @xmath45 ( @xmath46 au being the radius of the c@xmath1 skeleton ) and @xmath47 ev ( which was found by matching the electron affinity @xmath48 ev of c@xmath1 with the assumption that the orbital momentum of the @xmath49-ev - state is @xmath50 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this choice is most consistent with observations . </S>",
    "<S> calculated @xmath51 and @xmath52 functions of valence spin - up and spin - down electrons of the cr , mn , mo , tc and eu atoms , both free and encapsulated inside c@xmath1 , are depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .    note how the encapsulation of the chosen atoms inside the c@xmath1 cage draws their outer @xmath51 and , respectively , @xmath52 orbital functions into the region of the c@xmath1 wall . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a significant transfer of electron density from the encapsulated atom to the cage , but , more importantly in the context of the present paper , a transfer of electron _ spin - density _ from the atom to the cage . </S>",
    "<S> the transfer makes the cage become ` spin - charged ' . </S>",
    "<S> the c@xmath1 cage becomes spin - charged even for the _ spin - neutral _ @xmath53 and @xmath54 subshells of endohedral mn and tc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is because of the stronger drain of the valence @xmath55@xmath22 than @xmath55@xmath21 electron density from the atom to the cage . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly enough , the spin - dependent drain of the valence electron density does not emerge in eu@c@xmath1 where both the @xmath56 and @xmath57 orbital functions are drawn into the c@xmath1 cage equally strongly , in contrast to the outer @xmath51 and @xmath52 orbital functions of the endohedral mn and tc atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the semifilled @xmath58@xmath21 subshell of eu lies much deeper relative to its @xmath59@xmath21 and @xmath59@xmath22 subshells than the semifilled @xmath60@xmath21 subshell of mn ( @xmath61 ) or tc ( @xmath62 ) relative their valence @xmath63@xmath21 and @xmath63@xmath22 subshells . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , the exchange interaction between the @xmath8@xmath21 and @xmath64@xmath21 electrons in eu is negligibly small . </S>",
    "<S> hence , there is practically no difference between the @xmath56 and @xmath57 functions both in free and encapsulated eu . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the eu atom retains its electron _ spin - density _ intact upon confinement inside c@xmath1 , which could prove important for an eventual application .    in conclusion , the authors believe that the c@xmath1 spin - charging effect we have described will affect the manipulation of spins in the corresponding @xmath0@c@xmath1 systems and that it must inhibit , or at least render more complex , the operation of a quantum register . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper thus brings to light a class of high - spin atoms which are less suitable for building a quantum register , namely those which are subject to a strong electron spin - density drain from the atom to the c@xmath1 cage . </S>",
