    "extended nebular filaments are commonly seen in association with the central galaxies of galaxy clusters .",
    "clusters that feature a massive central galaxy are also often identified as having a cooling flow , based on cooling - timescale arguments or other evidence ( fabian , nulsen , & canizares 1984 ) .",
    "this association has prompted speculation that the optical nebulosity is linked causally or energetically to the intracluster medium ( icm ) , and hence may be an important diagnostic of the cooling - flow phenomenon . as a result ,",
    "several previous studies have investigated optical `` cooling - flow filaments '' in attempts to understand their physical properties .",
    "these efforts have helped delineate the observed characteristics of the nebulosity , and have prompted a variety of theoretical explanations for what is seen .",
    "optical spectroscopy reveals that the filaments emit strongly in low - ionization forbidden lines , thus resembling low ionization nuclear emission - line regions ( liners ; heckman 1980 ) .",
    "heckman et al . ( 1989 ) also reported evidence that cooling - flow filaments can be separated into two characteristic groups based on their line - intensity ratios .",
    "typical ratios for type i systems are [ ] @xmath0/h@xmath1 , [ ] @xmath2/h@xmath3 , and [ ] @xmath4/h@xmath5 ; these objects tend to have low x - ray and h@xmath6 luminosities and are associated with low cooling rates and small optical filaments .",
    "in contrast , typical ratios for type ii objects are [ ] @xmath0/h@xmath7 , [ ] @xmath2/h@xmath8 , and [ ] @xmath4/h@xmath9 ; these sources have high x - ray and h@xmath6 luminosities and are associated with high inferred cooling rates and extended optical filaments .",
    "theoretical efforts to interpret the optical spectra have invoked various combinations of cooling or irradiation from the icm , shocks , active galactic nucleus ( agn ) emission or outflows , magnetic reconnection , and hot stars . however , none of these scenarios has proven entirely satisfactory in explaining the observations ; consequently , the origins and energetics of these systems remain poorly understood .",
    "an important example of optical filaments in apparent association with a cooling flow is found in ngc  1275 ( kent & sargent 1979 ) , the central elliptical galaxy in the perseus cluster ( abell  426 ) .",
    "the nebular gas extends to at least 20 kpc from the center of the galaxy ( assuming h@xmath10=75 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 ) , with a complicated spatial structure ; the optical spectrum fits within heckman et al.s type ii category .",
    "the surrounding intracluster medium is believed to have a cooling flow , with mass deposition rates of up to 130 m@xmath12 yr@xmath11 ( fabian , cowie , & grindley 1981 ; allen et al .",
    "ngc  1275 features additional unusual characteristics that may be relevant to interpreting the extended nebular emission .",
    "the central elliptical galaxy is seen at a recession velocity of @xmath13 km s@xmath11 , but is partially obscured by a smaller _ foreground _ galaxy at a velocity of @xmath14 km s@xmath11 ( minkowski 1957 ) ; the redshift difference is consistent with the velocity dispersion observed for this cluster ( e.g. , kent & sargent 1983 ) .",
    "ngc  1275 is also host to a strong agn and associated radio source , 3c  84 , which emits jets that may be interacting with the ambient gas ( pedlar , booler , & davies 1983 ; pedlar et al . 1990 ) .    in this paper , we report the results of a detailed study of the physical properties of the optical filaments associated with ngc  1275 .",
    "this work makes use of extensive spectroscopic observations to quantify two - dimensional aspects of the observed emission , and also places sensitive limits on weak spectral features of diagnostic interest .",
    "the results can be used to place stringent limits on the role of various agents proposed for heating or ionization of this plasma .",
    "long - slit spectra of the filaments of ngc  1275 were acquired in 10 observing runs during 1988  1990 , using the shane 3-m telescope + uv schmidt ccd spectrograph at lick observatory ( miller & stone 1987 ) .",
    "the resulting data cover the wavelength range 3396  6940    in three bandpasses , spanning 3396  5000   , 4695  6280   , and 6130  6940   .",
    "the slit was 2.5@xmath15 wide and 132@xmath15 long , with spatial sampling of 0.66@xmath15  pixel@xmath11 .",
    "observations were acquired with the slit centered on the nucleus and oriented at four different position angles ( pa = 62 , 77 , 283 , and 313 ) selected to lie along filaments with the highest surface brightness in h@xmath6 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "typical atmospheric seeing was 2and not all observations were done under strictly photometric conditions .",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath163.5 longward of 6130 and @xmath167 elsewhere .",
    "the giant region detected by shields & filippenko ( 1990a ) lies at pa = 62 .",
    "line emission from the high - velocity system ( @xmath17 km s@xmath11 ) appears primarily northwest of the nucleus ( e.g. , unger et al . 1990 ) ; it is visible in our spectra acquired at pa = 313 , and to a lesser extent at pa = 283 .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques , as implemented in iraf .",
    "spectra acquired at the same position angle and wavelength setting were averaged after flux and wavelength calibration and sky subtraction .",
    "estimates of the sky contribution were derived from regions near the ends of the slit , where no nebular emission was evident and the contribution of galaxy starlight was minimal .",
    "measurements of filament emission were obtained for regions where h@xmath6 emission was detected in a visual inspection of the 2-dimensional ( 2-d ) spectra .",
    "emission - line strengths for the stronger lines were measured along the slit on a pixel - by - pixel basis , using an automated algorithm . for each resulting 1-d spectrum ,",
    "the continuum in each wavelength setting was approximated by a low - order polynomial fit to emission - free bandpasses .",
    "after subtraction of the continuum , candidate emission lines were measured by fitting gaussian profiles to all features detected at @xmath18 significance .",
    "the lines were subsequently identified , and spurious features rejected , by comparison of the measured list with an input list of line wavelengths , shifted by an a priori estimate of the emission redshift ; this redshift value was measured interactively for h@xmath6 in the spectrum of the filament coadded along the slit .",
    "lines were identified if the predicted and observed wavelengths agreed to within 5  .",
    "this bound was set to allow for the correct identification of lines in the presence of substantial ( @xmath19 km s@xmath11 ) velocity gradients that are observed in this gas ( e.g. , rubin et al .",
    "the line flux measured by this method is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the line profile dispersion as determined by the gaussian fit and @xmath22 is the peak height of the emission line above the continuum .",
    "estimation of line - intensity ratios for the ngc  1275 nebulosity requires correction for reddening .",
    "the filaments are subject to a galactic foreground extinction of @xmath23 mag ( lockman & savage 1995 ) as well as internal extinction , some of which may be due to the high - velocity system .",
    "the limited signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of many of the pixel - by - pixel spectral extractions translates into significant uncertainties in a reddening value based on balmer - line ratios , and as a result we derived an average reddening correction for each filament ( i.e. , region of nebular emission seen on one side of the nucleus at a given pa ) .",
    "we obtained total extinction values from the measured h@xmath6/h@xmath24 line - intensity ratio , assuming an intrinsic value of 2.86 ( hummer & storey 1987 ) and the extinction curve of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) . the results were compared with extinction values implied by line ratios employing h@xmath25 and h@xmath26 , and were found to be consistent , with the exception of measurements for pa = 313 , where the limited s / n made the high - order balmer lines unmeasurable , and for pa = 283 .",
    "the line ratios at the latter pa show evidence of underlying stellar absorption , which is not surprising in light of earlier reports of early - type stellar contributions to the integrated light seen in some portions of ngc  1275 ( e.g. , wirth et al .",
    "the influence of the stellar features is apparently strongest at this pa since the emission equivalent widths are relatively weak . for this filament",
    "we determined a consistent reddening value for the higher balmer transitions subject to absorption with constant equivalent width .",
    "the total extinctions ( including the galactic contribution , and neglecting the redshift difference of the absorbers ) calculated by these means are @xmath27 1.0@xmath280.2 , 0.8@xmath280.2 , 2.3@xmath280.5 , and 1.1@xmath280.4 mag for filaments at pa = 62 , 77 , 283 , and 313 , respectively . the larger value of extinction towards pa = 283may be caused by the high - velocity system ( unger et al .",
    "the b - band atmospheric feature appears slightly longward of redshifted [ ] @xmath296731 , but does not affect measurements of that line .",
    "in addition to studying the spatially resolved emission at each pa , we generated a composite spectrum of the filament system in order to study weak emission features .",
    "for each pa , the 2-d spectra were averaged over intervals of high s / n filament emission ( s / n @xmath30 5 for h@xmath6 ) . for pa = 62 ,",
    "this criterion translated into an extracted region 14@xmath15 wide , centered 23@xmath15 away from the nucleus .",
    "the pa = 77  and pa = 283  extractions were 18.5@xmath15 wide , centered at 21@xmath15 and 20@xmath15 away from the nucleus , respectively .",
    "the extraction for pa = 313  spanned 33@xmath15 , centered at 26@xmath15 from the nucleus ; we ultimately decided not to include this extraction in the composite spectrum because the emission - line equivalent widths were generally less than for the other pas , with a correspondingly lower s / n .",
    "the resulting 1-d spectra were shifted to the rest wavelength scale , as determined from the redshift of the balmer lines , and the spectra for different pas were then combined to a single overall average .",
    "the relative velocity shifts between the filament extractions were less than 90 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the final composite spectrum ( figure 2 ) represents a total integration time of 10 hours in each wavelength setting .    in order to improve the accuracy of the continuum subtraction for the composite spectrum",
    ", we experimented with modeling the stellar continuum with templates derived from observations of emission - free galaxies .",
    "a reasonable correspondence in terms of the strength of stellar features in ngc  1275 was found with the spectrum of ngc  205 .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion of ngc  1275 is 250 km s@xmath11 ( nelson & whittle 1995 ) while that of ngc  205 is 50 km s@xmath11 ( held , mould , & de zeeuw 1990 ) .",
    "we consequently convolved the ngc  205 spectrum with a gaussian having @xmath31 km s@xmath11 in order to match the dispersion seen in ngc  1275 . to optimize the template match , a fit with @xmath32 minimization",
    "was carried out using specfit as implemented in iraf ( kriss 1994 ) , varying the template redshift , scaling , and reddening .",
    "a best fit was obtained with @xmath33 mag .",
    "the galactic extinction for ngc  205 is @xmath34 mag ( burstein & heiles 1984 ) ; if the two galaxies were perfectly matched in spectral properties , this would imply a total extinction for ngc  1275 of @xmath35 mag , in agreement with the galactic foreground estimate .",
    "this value is somewhat less than is obtained from balmer emission lines for the filaments ; the disparity may stem from real differences in the reddening of starlight and nebular emission , and/or differences in stellar populations for ngc  1275 and ngc  205 .",
    "the spectral regions over which we performed the continuum fitting do not appear to be affected strongly by metallicity differences between ngc  1275 and ngc  205 .",
    "for the stronger emission features , line strengths measured after subtraction of this continuum fit were consistent with the results obtained from a smooth fit to the continuum , as employed for the pixel - by - pixel extractions .",
    "use of the galaxy template was important for obtaining accurate values or limits for the weaker features , however , and for some lines the template fit was locally optimized ( by adjusting the scaling ) in order to match the observed continuum .",
    "the line fluxes obtained after subtraction of the continuum template are listed in table 1 , and were obtained from gaussian profile fits as described above .",
    "error bars listed for the detected lines represent the root - mean - square uncertainty per pixel ( @xmath36 ) in the local continuum , summed in quadrature over a width of 6@xmath37 , i.e. , @xmath38 . for lines that were not detected , we list @xmath39 upper limits of @xmath40(3@xmath36 ) , where @xmath37 is the width of either h@xmath24 or h@xmath6 , depending on which of these balmer lines is closer in wavelength . for the composite spectrum",
    ", the h@xmath6/h@xmath24 ratio implies a total extinction of @xmath41 mag , yielding an intrinsic value of @xmath42 mag .",
    "the higher - order balmer lines in the continuum - subtracted spectrum showed evidence for being over - corrected for the underlying stellar absorption : ( h@xmath26/h@xmath24)@xmath43 @xmath44 ( h@xmath26/h@xmath24)@xmath45 .",
    "the implied disparity between the ngc  1275 and template spectra does not significantly influence the estimate of @xmath46 obtained from h@xmath6/h@xmath24 , however , due to the large equivalent widths of these emission features .",
    "an informative overview of the emission properties of the ngc  1275 filaments can be obtained from standard line - ratio diagrams employed for nebular classification ( baldwin , phillips , & terlevich 1981 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows three such diagrams along with measurements from the pixel - by - pixel extracted spectra for ngc  1275 .",
    "the observations have been corrected for reddening , as described in  2 , and the use of intensity ratios of lines close in wavelength makes these diagrams insensitive to any residual reddening uncertainties .",
    "loci commonly adopted for classification of regions , seyfert nuclei , and liners are also indicated ( e.g. , shields & filippenko 1990b ) .",
    "as found in previous work , the filaments in ngc  1275 are characterized by low - ionization emission , resembling that of liners ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "an additional diagram illustrating the ionization state of the gas is shown in figure 4 , which is a plot of [ ] @xmath296300/[]@xmath295007 versus [ ] @xmath293727/[]@xmath295007 ; this combination is more sensitive to reddening , but has the benefit of tracing the ionization of a single element .",
    "figure 4 shows that the filaments overlap the low - ionization extreme of liner behavior , and in particular extend to very high [ ] / [ ] ratios .",
    "we note further that in figure 3 the measurements do not uniformly populate the liner locus , but instead are clearly concentrated to relatively low values for each of the forbidden - line / recombination - line ratios .",
    "another way of stating this result is that the nebulosity is not merely described by low ionization , as for liners , but is also characterized by low excitation . since the forbidden lines arise from collisional excitation , while the balmer lines trace recombination , this result implicates a relatively low degree of heating per ionization in the cluster filaments .",
    "an interesting result illustrated by the 2-d spectra is that the distribution of points shows a larger variation in the [ ] /h@xmath24 ratio than in ratios employing the forbidden lines of lower ionization , such as [ ] /h@xmath6 , [ ] /h@xmath6 , and [ ] /h@xmath6 .",
    "the measurements include data for pa = 62  at the location of a giant region reported by shields & filippenko ( 1990a ) .",
    "the ratios for this locale are distinct from those elsewhere in the filaments , and contribute excursions to low values of [ ] /h@xmath6 and [ ] /h@xmath6 seen in figures 3@xmath47 and 3@xmath48 .",
    "removal of these points would increase the contrast between variation in [ ] /h@xmath24 and in the other ratios .",
    "a set of weak lines that are of special interest are the coronal lines .",
    "these high - ionization collisionally excited lines are emitted from gas at a temperature of @xmath49 k , which is intermediate between that of the icm , 10@xmath50 k , and the optical filaments , @xmath51 k. the coronal lines trace gas in the process of cooling and their strength is a direct measure of the mass cooling rate , @xmath52 ( hu , cowie , & wang 1985 ; sarazin & graney 1991 ) .",
    "detection of coronal lines may thus provide important diagnostics of the cooling - flow phenomenon .",
    "the wavelength range covered in our spectra includes several coronal lines , specifically [ ] @xmath294232 , [ ] @xmath294414 , [ ] @xmath295303 , [ ] @xmath295445 , [ ] @xmath296374 , and [ ] @xmath296702 .",
    "none of these transitions was detected in our composite spectrum .",
    "upper limits to these lines were measured after subtracting a fit to the stellar continuum using a galaxy template of ngc  205 , as described in  2 .",
    "the location of [ ] @xmath296374 coincides with the red wing of [ ] @xmath296364 and consequently warranted special treatment .",
    "the following procedure was used to remove the oxygen line .",
    "a stellar continuum was fitted over the wavelength range of 6250 to 6350  as described in  2 , simultaneously with a gaussian to [ ] @xmath296300 . to remove [ ] @xmath296364 , we divided the template of [ ] @xmath296300 by the line ratio of 3.0 dictated by atomic parameters ( osterbrock 1989 ) , and subtracted the resulting profile and continuum fit from the composite spectrum .",
    "an upper limit for [ ] @xmath296374 was derived from the residual .",
    "the upper limits on the coronal lines were corrected for extinction corresponding to @xmath53 mag , the same as that applied to the detected lines .",
    "the results are listed in table 2 .",
    "utilizing theoretical models and our upper limits , we can calculate upper limits on the cooling rate of the hot icm as measured in our apertures . the coronal line expected to have the highest emissivity is [ ] @xmath296374 , for which sarazin & graney ( 1991 ) predict @xmath54  erg  s@xmath11 for every 1 m@xmath12  yr@xmath11 .",
    "for the one - pixel equivalent aperture corresponding to the composite spectrum , the upper limit to the reddening - corrected surface brightness of this line that we measure is @xmath55   erg  s@xmath11  @xmath56   arcsec@xmath57 .",
    "the composite spectrum is averaged over regions that extend out to a radius of @xmath16 28@xmath15 .",
    "assuming that the coronal emission is distributed uniformly within this radius , our measurement suggests an upper limit for the luminosity of [ ] of @xmath58 erg s@xmath11 , corresponding to a mass cooling rate of less than 2900 m@xmath12 yr@xmath11 .",
    "this value of @xmath59 is well above the accretion rate derived from x - ray observations ; upper limits to the other coronal features would lead to even less restrictive limits on @xmath59 .",
    "these results underscore the practical difficulty in using the coronal lines to constrain @xmath59 , even with the investment of substantial amounts of observing time .",
    "the strength of coronal emisson relative to h@xmath6 is of interest if the nebular filaments are energetically coupled to the cooling icm .",
    "a cold filament irradiated by an isobarically cooling gas reprocesses the ionizing radiation into h@xmath6 with an efficiency @xmath163% ( voit & donahue 1990 ; donahue & voit 1991 ) .",
    "the h@xmath6 strength would thus be 0.03 ( 5/2 ) @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the proton mass , @xmath62 is the mean mass per particle in units of @xmath61 , @xmath63 is the temperature of the hot gas , and @xmath64 is the boltzmann constant . in this picture , both the h@xmath6 and coronal - line luminosities scale with @xmath59 , leading to well - defined predictions for their ratios , which we list in table 3 ( voit , donahue , & slavin 1994 ; sarazin & graney 1991 ) .    the observed upper limits to the coronal - line strengths relative to h@xmath6 are larger than those of the predictions , thus leaving open the possibility that the filaments are ionized by the cooling icm , a scenario we examine in more detail in section 4 .",
    "the same data set as employed here was used by shields & filippenko ( 1992 ) to obtain a more restrictive limit on [ ] @xmath296374 , after binning the data on the basis of h@xmath6 surface brightness . the use of an intermediate surface brightness bin produced a somewhat higher s / n ratio in the continuum . their upper limit to [ ] @xmath296374/h@xmath6 was @xmath65 , adjusted to use the same upper - limit definition and reddening correction employed here .",
    "this value is @xmath66% less than the theoretical prediction , which may implicate other ionization sources for the filaments . however",
    ", this conclusion assumes that the cooling plasma irradiating the nebular gas lies within our measurement aperture , rather than on larger scales , and that the coronal feature displays the same velocity width as h@xmath6 .",
    "similar observational upper limits for coronal lines from cooling - flow filaments in other clusters have been reported by donahue & stocke ( 1994 ) and yan & cohen ( 1995 ) .",
    "an additional complication to the use of the coronal lines as diagnostics of cooling stems from persistent uncertainties in the relevant atomic data ( e.g. , mohan , hibbert , & kingston 1994 ; pelan & berrington 1995 ; storey , mason , & saraph 1996 ; ferguson , korista , & ferland 1997 ; oliva 1997 ) . as summarized by voit et al .",
    "( 1994 ) for [ ] @xmath295303 , alternative choices of atomic parameter values can lead to order - of - magnitude differences in the predicted emissivities for a cooling icm . as noted in table 3 , our upper limit to [ ]",
    "@xmath295303/h@xmath6 is less than the value predicted by voit et al .",
    "( 1994 ) but larger than that of sarazin & graney ( 1991 ) .",
    "an unambiguous interpretation of coronal - line limits or detections will require further improvement in the atomic data .",
    "a question central to the understanding of cooling - flow filaments is the issue of what ionizes and powers these systems .",
    "a comparison of the recombination expected for mass deposition rates obtained from x - ray observations with the observed h@xmath6 line luminosities makes it clear that simple cooling of the gas with a transition through a nebular phase is insufficient to explain the energy requirements of the filaments in ngc  1275 and other objects ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "a variety of mechanisms have been proposed for the ionization of cooling - flow filaments .",
    "below we compare the predictions of these scenarios with the results of our observational study , taking into account various physical constraints .",
    "ngc  1275 shows evidence for a seyfert - like nucleus ( seyfert 1943 ) , as is clear from the emission - line spectrum ( e.g. , filippenko & sargent 1985 ) and nonstellar continuum from the central regions .",
    "if the extended nebulosity is photoionized by this continuum , the ionization state of the gas will reflect the ionization parameter , which we define here as the ratio of ionizing photon and electron densities at the face of the irradiated cloud . the line ratio [ ] @xmath296717/[]@xmath296731 is sensitive to the electron density , but remains consistent with the low - density limit ( @xmath67 @xmath68 ; osterbrock 1989 ) throughout the filaments .",
    "while the density may vary below this threshold within the measured regions , pressure arguments suggest that large fluctuations are unlikely ( e.g. , johnstone & fabian 1988 ; heckman et al .",
    "if the nebular filaments are ionized by the agn , we would then expect that the ionization parameter would largely vary in the same way as the ionizing flux , proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "the line ratio that is the best diagnostic of the ionization state is [ ] @xmath295007/h@xmath24 , since this ratio involves a high - ionization line ( e.g. , ferland & netzer 1983 ; ho et al .",
    "the filaments range from @xmath70 to @xmath71 in projected distance from the nucleus .",
    "if these structures lie in the plane of the sky , then the change in the ionization parameter due to geometric dilution of flux would be approximately one order of magnitude , translating into a significant variation in [ ] /h@xmath24 .",
    "values of this line ratio as a function of radius for each of the filaments are shown in figure 5 .",
    "while negative gradients are seen in some places , the variations at large radial distance tend to be small and/or non - monotonic , a result that is in agreement with previous observations having more limited pa coverage ( johnstone & fabian 1988 ) .    the observed behavior may still be consistent with photoionization by a central source if the physical distance from the nucleus is not indicated by the projected distance .",
    "johnstone & fabian ( 1988 ) constructed a detailed model to study the effects of geometry in the filaments of ngc  1275 , and were able to reproduce the observed line ratios as a function of projected distance , but suggested some disagreement with the observed surface brightness of the filaments .",
    "the present data show reasonable consistency between measured surface brightnesses and predictions for ionization by the nucleus .",
    "the flux in the ultraviolet continuum measured by the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( kinney et al . 1991 ) and x - ray measurements from _ einstein _ ( branduardi - raymont et al . 1981 ) imply a 2-point spectral index between 2500   ( after dereddening ) and 2 kev of @xmath72 ( assuming @xmath73 ) . extrapolating the uv flux assuming a power law with this slope implies an ionizing luminosity of @xmath74 photons s@xmath11 .",
    "clouds with a density of @xmath75 @xmath68 at a characteristic distance of @xmath76 kpc will be described by an ionization parameter of @xmath77 , consistent with the observed line ratios .",
    "these numbers also predict for ionization - bounded clouds an emission measure ( em ) of @xmath78 @xmath79 pc , in reasonable agreement ( given the uncertainties in this calculation ) with the observed ( reddening - corrected ) surface brightness of h@xmath6 of @xmath80 ergs s@xmath11 @xmath56 arcsec@xmath57 , corresponding to em @xmath81 @xmath79 pc . however , despite this nominal agreement , ionization by the agn appears unlikely based on other line diagnostics that are independent of projection .",
    "a line of particular interest for this purpose is  @xmath294686 since it is a gauge of the hardness of the ionizing continuum .",
    "figure 6 shows the composite filament spectrum for ngc  1275 in the region of @xmath294686 together with the template continuum .",
    "the observed 3@xmath82 upper limit for @xmath294686/h@xmath24 is 0.024 , after dereddening .",
    "photoionization simulations show that this value is sensitive to the ionization parameter for a given spectral shape .",
    "based on the continuum and nebular parameters described above , we examined this issue using photoionization calculations obtained with cloudy , version 90.04 ( ferland 1996 ) .",
    "the result is a prediction that @xmath294686/h@xmath83 , which is four times our upper limit .",
    "therefore , the nebular filaments in ngc  1275 are highly unlikely to be powered by the agn .",
    "in addition to being a source of ionizing radiation , the agn in ngc  1275 is a radio source ( 3c  84 ) with extended radio structures ( pedlar 1981 et al . ; pedlar et al .",
    "1990 ) , that may in principle power the optical nebulosity .",
    "the relation between the radio plasma and the nebular gas was discussed briefly by mcnamara , oconnell , & sarazin ( 1996 ) in a multiwavelength study dealing with ngc  1275 and its environs .",
    "the extended radio emission roughly coincides with two cavities in the x - ray gas located on the northeast and southwest outer portions of the galaxy ( pedlar et al .",
    "1990 ; mcnamara et al .",
    "the nebular emission seems to avoid the radio emission , which may be evidence for the radio lobes displacing the nebular gas .",
    "another interpretation would be that the nebular gas , which has a higher density , may be confining the radio - emitting gas and channeling it to regions of lower density ( mcnamara et al .",
    "1996 ) . in any case , if an interaction with the radio lobes were responsible for powering the nebular emission , we might expect the optical filaments to be correlated spatially with the radio structures .",
    "this correspondence is not seen , but might indicate that the shocked gas remains in a hot phase .",

    "chandra _ , however , show little evidence for x - ray emission by a hot shocked component in the regions in question ( m. wise , private communication ) ; a similar situation has been reported for hydra a ( mcnamara et al . 2000 ) . as will be argued below",
    ", these results and additional spectroscopic constraints suggest that shock heating is unlikely in the filaments of ngc  1275 .",
    "the above arguments point toward a distributed ionizing source as the underlying power source for the filaments in ngc  1275 .",
    "this ionization mechanism could in principle be shocks , stars , and/or the cooling icm itself .",
    "several observational properties can be interpreted as possible evidence of shocks in the filaments .",
    "the velocity field of the nebular gas shows variations of @xmath84 km s@xmath11 ( e.g. , burbidge & burbidge 1965 ; heckman et al .",
    "moreover , the line widths are greater than the thermal width .",
    "line emission from gas at a temperature of 10,000 k will exhibit a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath85 km s@xmath11 for hydrogen , which can be compared with observed fwhm values of @xmath84 km s@xmath11 in the spatially - resolved spectra , after removal of the instrumental width .",
    "several possible mechanisms are available for driving shocks , including interaction of the radio plasma from the agn with surrounding gas (  3.3.1 ) , pressure imbalances resulting from thermally unstable cooling in the cluster center ( cowie , fabian , & nulsen 1980 ) , and accretion infall onto the central galaxy . for shocks driven by radio ejecta , bicknell , dopita , & odea ( 1997 )",
    "have shown that the luminosity in h@xmath6 is of order 0.1% of the energy flux into the radio plasma , with the exact value dependent on the gas density distribution and shock velocity . for ngc  1275 ,",
    "pedlar et al . (",
    "1990 ) estimate that @xmath86 erg s@xmath11 is injected into the radio halo ; this value is inversely related to the age of the halo , which pedlar et al . take to be @xmath87 years or less .",
    "the total h@xmath6 luminosity of the ngc  1275 filaments is @xmath88 erg s@xmath11 ( heckman et al .",
    "1989 ; caulet et al .",
    "it appears doubtful that the radio source is sufficient to power the observed line emission , unless the radio halo is exceedingly young or the energy transfer to optical emission is unusually efficient .",
    "efficient cooling of matter near the cluster center can lead to regions that are underpressured relative to their surroundings , and hence will be subjected to repressurizing shocks ( cowie , fabian , & nulsen 1980 ) .",
    "the power delivered by such shocks results from the thermal and mechanical energy of the icm , so that the maximum power that be can extracted from the cooling icm is ( 5/2 ) @xmath89 erg s@xmath11 . only about 3% of this energy",
    "is processed into h@xmath6 , requiring that the cooling clouds be shocked multiple times to reproduce the observed emission ( the `` @xmath90 problem '' ; see heckman et al .",
    "1989 for a discussion ) .",
    "the apparent survival of grains in the filaments of other cooling - flow galaxies suggests that passage of repeated shocks through the nebular gas is unlikely ( donahue & voit 1993 ) .    if the bulk kinetic energy of infalling matter dominates the energy inflow to the central region , the power available for driving shocks is of order @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the characteristic infall speed .",
    "if @xmath92 is as high as the cluster velocity dispersion ( @xmath93 km s@xmath11 ; kent & sargent 1983 ) , the resulting rate of energy transfer is @xmath94 erg s@xmath11 , which is sufficient to power the filament emission .",
    "however , if @xmath92 is closer to the filament velocity dispersion , the available power is an order of magnitude less , and probably insufficient to generate the observed h@xmath6 luminosity .",
    "one general characteristic of shocks is that line - intensity ratios of emitted radiation reflect the kinetic energy flux entering the shock front , and hence are a function of shock velocity ( e.g. , shull & mckee 1979 ; dopita & sutherland 1995 , binette , dopita , & tuohy 1985 ) .",
    "if the observed line width reflects the characteristic shock velocity , then we would expect the line ratios to correlate with line width ; such behavior is in fact seen in large - scale outflows from starburst galaxies ( e.g. , heckman et al .",
    "1999 ) . a plot of log([]@xmath296583/h@xmath6 ) versus the fwhm of h@xmath6 from the four pas is shown in figure 7 , together with model predictions , which exhibit a positive trend in most cases .",
    "the range of observed fwhm is @xmath84 km s@xmath11 , while [ ] /h@xmath6 is clustered around 0.9 .",
    "a shallow but statistically significant correlation ( spearman non - parametric significance of @xmath95 ) is present , with larger line ratios associated with higher velocity width .",
    "this trend is due to combining values from all the pas ; pa = 283  and pa = 313  have slightly higher line ratios and fwhm than pa = 62  and pa = 77 .",
    "significant correlations are not seen in either the individual pas or in pa62/pa77 and pa283/pa313 groupings , making shocks as heating sources in the filaments unlikely .",
    "similar behavior is seen in the [ ] /h@xmath24 ratios , although no correlation or pa - dependent behavior is evident in [ ] /h@xmath6 or [ ] /h@xmath6 .",
    "a further piece of evidence which argues against shocks comes from the upper limit on electron temperature as determined from the [ ] lines ( table 1 ) .",
    "figure 8 shows the continuum around the expected location of [ ] @xmath294363 .",
    "an upper limit on the temperature as measured from [ ] @xmath294363/[]@xmath29@xmath294959 , 5007 @xmath960.047 restricts the electron temperature to be less than 33,000 k ( osterbrock 1989 ; shaw & dufour 1995 ) .",
    "shock models predict [ ] @xmath294363/[]@xmath29@xmath294959 , 5007 to be between 0.01 and 0.07 ( shull & mckee 1979 ; raymond 1979 ; binette et al .",
    "1985 ; dopita & sutherland 1995 ) , corresponding to electron temperatures between 13,000 k and 54,000 k. shock models with velocities less than @xmath97 km s@xmath11 predict an [ ] line ratio consistent with our upper limit , but have problems in simultaneously matching the high- and low - ionization forbidden - line strengths .",
    "these models also consistently underpredict @xmath295876 , except at high velocities , where the predicted @xmath294686 exceeds our upper limit ( raymond 1979 ; binette et al .",
    "1985 ; dopita & sutherland 1995 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that shock heating in the filaments of ngc  1275 is a minor contributor to the energetics of the nebular gas .",
    "cooling - flow galaxies commonly exhibit an optical continuum that is bluer than typical elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , johnstone , fabian , & nulsen 1987 ; mcnamara & oconnell 1989 ; allen 1995 ; cardiel , gorgas , & aragon - salamanca 1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "some degree of correlation exists between such blue continua and nebular emission , prompting suggestions that both may trace the influence of an underlying young stellar population . while nebular emission ( bremsstrahlung , free - bound , and 2-photon )",
    "may contribute to such a continuum , a quantitative calculation indicates that the continuum emission accompanying the observed h@xmath24 luminosity would be 2 orders of magnitude too weak to account for the observed light .",
    "stars are thus the likely source of the blue continua . as possible ionizing agents for the nebular gas , stars also have the added appeal of producing negligible nebular emission , consistent with the observations of ngc  1275 and other cooling - flow galaxies .",
    "early studies of the large - scale nebular morphology of ngc  1275 interpreted this object and its system of radial filaments as the result of a large - scale outflow ; indeed , it was called an `` exploding galaxy '' ( burbidge & burbidge 1965 ) . modern studies of another object given this label , m82 , demonstrate that it is in a sense `` exploding '' because of its large - scale outflow driven by star formation ( e.g. , mccarthy et al . 1987 ; shopbell & bland - hawthorn 1998 ) . however , such vigorous star formation is not apparent in ngc  1275 .",
    "ngc  1275 does show weaker indications of star formation within the last @xmath98 yrs on a variety of scales ( wirth et al .",
    "1983 ; holtzman et al . 1992 ; mcnamara et al . 1996 ) .",
    "optical measures of the young population have been used to estimate roughly the associated ionizing luminosity , yielding a result that is consistent with the requirements of powering the filaments ( wirth et al .",
    "1983 ; romanishin 1987 ) .",
    "however , there is not a strong spatial correspondence between the regions of recent star formation and the nebular gas .",
    "as noted previously , the nebular spectrum also differs markedly from typical region spectra ; in the one instance where recent star formation is clearly evident within a filament ( at pa = 62 ) , the nebular line ratios are distinct from the remainder of the filament system ( shields & filippenko 1990a ) .",
    "photoionization models suggest that hot stars can generate liner - like emission ( filippenko & terlevich 1992 ; shields 1992 ) , but these scenarios generally have difficulty producing [ ] and [ ] emission as strong as seen here , unless the gas contains a very high density component ( @xmath99 @xmath68 )",
    ".    stars may nonetheless play a role in powering the filaments if they generate a radiation field that ionizes gas on scales exceeding that of localized regions .",
    "a similar scenario has recently gained favor for explaining the ionization of the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) commonly seen in spiral galaxies ( e.g. , howk & sembach 1999 ; rand 1998 ; martin 1997 ) .",
    "however , the forbidden - line strengths seen in the dig are characteristically weaker than in the ngc  1275 filaments ; typical dig line ratios are [ ] @xmath296300/h@xmath100 , [ ] @xmath296583/h@xmath101 , @xmath295876/h@xmath6 @xmath102 , and [ ] @xmath295007/h@xmath103 ( galarza , walterbos , & braun 1999 ; sembach et al .",
    "2000 ) , which contrasts markedly with the values in table 1 .",

    "1999 ; hoopes et al . 1999 ) .",
    "in contrast , the average em in ngc  1275 for the regions studied here is @xmath16 900 @xmath79 pc .",
    "given the arguments for and against stellar photoionization , it may be the case that this excitation process , if present , is at work in combination with another ionization source , as has been pointed out by voit & donahue ( 1997 ) for abell  2597 .",
    "the evidence from ngc  1275 , however , does not form a strong case for stellar photoionization as the dominant heating mechanism in the filaments .",
    "the hot icm surrounding ngc  1275 can be the ionization source of the filaments if its energy is channeled efficiently into the nebulosity ( voit & donahue 1990 ; begelman & fabian 1990 ) .",
    "in one such scenario , known as self - irradiation , the hot icm ionizes nebulae that have already cooled and condensed from the icm itself ( donahue & voit 1991 ; voit & donahue 1990 ; voit et al .",
    "another way to channel icm energy into the nebulae is the formation of mixing layers between cold clouds ( @xmath105 k ) embedded in a hot ambient medium ( @xmath106 k ) ( begelman & fabian 1990 ; crawford & fabian 1992 ) .",
    "line emission comes from the mixing layer , which is described by an intermediate temperature ( @xmath107 k ) , and from the cool cloud that is now being irradiated by the mixing layer .",
    "crawford & fabian ( 1992 ) were able to reproduce the line ratios of abell  496 , a cluster that displays type i filaments , with a mixing - layer prescription .",
    "however , in order to reproduce the line ratios of the type ii cluster abell  2597 , these authors found it necessary to invoke an additional energetic contribution from shocks .",
    "the observed line ratios in ngc  1275 are close to values predicted by one of the self - irradiation models presented by voit et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . in that model ( d39t67 ) , the icm is cooling from a temperature of 5@xmath10810@xmath109 k , the ionization parameter is 10@xmath110 , and the column density of irradiated is 10@xmath111 @xmath56 .",
    "their predicted @xmath294686/h@xmath24 ratio is almost a factor of 3 larger than our upper limit .",
    "this comparison shows that self - irradiation is not the ionization mechanism because it provides a continuum which is harder than that inferred from the observed line ratios .",
    "a cooling - flow system that shows similar filaments , in terms of line ratios , to ngc  1275 is abell  2597 ( heckman et al .",
    "1989 ; voit & donahue 1997 ) .",
    "voit & donahue ( 1997 ) similarly ruled out a hard ionizing continuum as the energy source in the filaments of abell  2597 on the basis of an upper limit of 0.02 on @xmath294686/h@xmath24 , which is again a factor of @xmath112 below expectations for self - irradiation .",
    "none of the ionization mechanisms considered individually in the preceding sections is entirely satisfactory in accounting for the emission properties and energetics of the cooling - flow filaments in ngc  1275 . given the compelling evidence for the presence of young stars , it is reasonable to explore models that are composites of stellar photoionization and some secondary heating mechanism .",
    "the study by voit & donahue ( 1997 ) of abell  2597 is illuminating in this regard .",
    "voit & donahue ( 1997 ) invoked stellar photoionization as the ionizing mechanism for the optical filaments of abell  2597 after placing strong upper limits on [ ] @xmath294363 and @xmath294686 , a result that ruled out shock heating and self - irradiation by the icm .",
    "however , they found that the electron temperature predicted for stellar photoionization was lower than what they inferred from their observations of the [ ] and [ ] lines .",
    "for this reason , they suggested that a heating source in addition to hot stars may be important .",
    "the secondary source they considered was the icm ; it can heat the filaments via electron conduction ( e.g. , sparks 1992 ) , acoustic - wave heating ( e.g. , pringle 1989 ) , and mhd - wave heating ( e.g. , friaca et al .",
    "voit & donahue ( 1997 ) argued that the resulting energy flux incident on the nebulae can become greater than that of photoelectric heating if the nebulae are characterized by low ionization , a case which holds in cooling - flow filaments .",
    "unfortunately , detailed theoretical predictions appropriate for comparison with observations have not yet been generated for these scenarios .",
    "a related case where the heating rates due to the dissipation of turbulence have been calculated and found to be comparable to the radiative cooling rates is in the dig of the milky way ( minter & spangler 1997 )",
    ". however , detailed observational parameters ( such as the amplitude of density fluctuations , and turbulence length scales ) needed to calculate the heating rate from this mechanism are unavailable for cooling - flow filaments .",
    "we investigated an alternative scenario in which the observed emission arises from a combination of clouds subject to stellar photoionization and irradiation by the icm . in this simplified model",
    ", we assumed that within a given measurement aperture , we see a mix of clouds ionized by stars and by radiation from the icm . in this picture",
    "we observe a weighted average of the spectrum of the two types of cloud .",
    "a fraction of the observed line emission comes from regions ionized by stars , while another fraction comes from nebulae irradiated by the icm .",
    "this weighted average translates into the corresponding fractions in terms of line ratios ( with all ratios normalized to h@xmath24 ) .",
    "we used line ratios from the self - irradiation models of voit et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and representative values for intermediate - metallicity regions ( veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ) .",
    "once the relative contributions of stars and the icm were determined from @xmath294686/h@xmath24 , attention was turned to reproducing [ ] @xmath296300/h@xmath6 as well as the other line ratios .",
    "[ ] @xmath296300/h@xmath6 is a good diagnostic because it is very weak in regions . including more stars pushed [ ] @xmath296300/h@xmath6 below observed values ,",
    "while more self - irradiation would push  @xmath294686/h@xmath24 above what is observed .",
    "ultimately we were not able to find a composite model that fits all the line ratios simultaneously .",
    "combinations satisfying the helium requirement , with marginal agreement for the other line ratios , failed to match the oxygen constraint , and vice versa .",
    "composite models can be found that satisfy both [ ] /h@xmath6 and /h@xmath24 , but these scenarios proved inconsistent with the other line ratios .",
    "the reason for this failure to come up with a successful hybrid model may be due to our simplistic approach , which neglects clouds that see ionizing radiation from _ both _ sources simultaneously , or more likely suggests that other ionization mechanisms are at work .      if the filaments in ngc  1275 and other cooling - flow galaxies are photoionized , hints about the nature of the ionizing continuum come from the strengths of the emission lines",
    ". relatively strong forbidden lines , the absence of  @xmath294686 , and the presence of  @xmath295876 suggest that the ionizing continuum cuts off at energies somewhere between 24 and 54 ev .",
    "an ionizing source generating a continuum with a natural cutoff at 54 ev is normal o - type stars .",
    "for this reason we tried in the previous subsection to construct a composite model of stellar photoionization and self - irradiation by the icm , but our attempts were unsuccessful in terms of matching the observed line ratios .",
    "the cooling icm can produce a range of ionizing continua , depending on its initial temperature .",
    "self - irradiation models ( voit et al . 1994 ) that predict a @xmath294686 value similar to what is observed fail at reproducing the other line ratios , while self - irradiation models that agree with most of the observed line ratios have high @xmath294686/h@xmath24 .",
    "one way to construct an appropriate ionizing spectrum with the shape dictated by the observations is to introduce a cutoff at the helium edge of 54 ev by attenuating the spectrum by an ionized screen .",
    "the filtering medium will imprint a sharp dip at 54 ev while leaving the flux of photons with energies between 24 and 54 ev nearly unchanged .",
    "observational evidence for such a screen may come from x - ray observations of abell  426 that suggest the presence of absorbing matter with a column density of @xmath113 @xmath56 , in excess of the galactic foreground component ; the ionization state of this medium is not well understood ( e.g. , allen , fabian , & edge 1992 ; arnaud & mushotzky 1998 ) .",
    "we therefore constructed models in which the ionizing continuum from the cooling icm is attenuated through a screen before irradiating the filaments .",
    "this scenario differs from the traditional self - irradiation models of voit & donahue ( 1990 ) in the sense that the filaments and the screen need not be the by - products of the cooling flow .",
    "the models discussed here also differ from the mixing layers picture of crawford & fabian ( 1992 ) in terms of the origin of the ionizing continuum . in the mixing layers model ,",
    "the ionizing spectrum comes from gas at a temperature intermediate between the temperature of the icm and that of the optical filaments .    to test the photoionization plus screen scenario",
    ", we carried out photoionization calculations using cloudy , version 90.04 ( ferland 1996 ) .",
    "we assumed plane - parallel geometry throughout the calculations , and a metallicity of 0.4 times solar values , consistent with x - ray studies ( e.g. , allen et al .",
    "the flux originating from the icm was scaled to match the soft x - ray central surface brightness reported by mohr , mathiesen , & evrard ( 1999 ) , and propagated consistently through the calculation .",
    "we found good results assuming a temperature for the dominant ionizing plasma of 10@xmath109 k. while lower than that of the majority of the icm , this value is in general accord with the high degree of cooling occurring in the perseus cluster core , and with spectroscopic evidence for cooler phases ( e.g. , mushotzky & szymkowiak 1988 ) in this region .    in order to have the appropriate screening properties , the ionization state of the filtering medium should be such that the optical depth at 54 ev is large enough to suppress @xmath294686 in the filaments , while the total hydrogen column density stays less than , or comparable to , the column density inferred from x - ray observations .",
    "moreover , the ionization parameter of the screen should be high enough to produce minimal optical forbidden - line emission , since the screen is evidently not seen in such lines .",
    "therefore , we chose the hydrogen density in the screen to be 1 @xmath68 , implying an ionization parameter of @xmath114 , and stopped the calculation when the optical depth at 54 ev became 10 .",
    "the resulting hydrogen column density in the screen is @xmath166@xmath10810@xmath115 @xmath56 . for the filament",
    ", the forbidden - line spectrum suggests an ionization parameter @xmath116 (  3.3.1 ) .",
    "this value emerges naturally from the propagated radiation field and a choice of density of @xmath117 @xmath68 , consistent with the observed [ ] @xmath296717/@xmath296731 line ratio .    resulting predictions for the emission - line spectrum emergent from a filament are shown in table 3 .",
    "all the line ratios were satisfactorily reproduced , with the exception of the [ ] lines , which are too strong by a factor of @xmath118 .",
    "figure 9 shows the continuum incident on the screen , and the continuum exiting the screen and incident on the filament .",
    "notice the strong ionized helium edge at 54 ev .",
    "since the ionized screen is photoionized , it will also emit recombination radiation , especially in @xmath294686 ( pa@xmath6 ) . in a sense , then , this model removes the difficulty of excess emission in the filaments , but probably creates a new observational inconsistency in that the screen should be a strong source of observable recombination emission , which is not apparently seen .    @xmath294686 emission would be reduced by a factor of @xmath119 if recombination in the screen were described by case a conditions rather than case b. however , the line center optical depth for ly@xmath25 , which upon reabsorption can branch to emit the pa@xmath6 line , remains @xmath120 for the column density and temperature describing our model screen ; additional turbulence of @xmath121 km s@xmath11 within the screen would be required to yield case a conditions .",

    "several pieces of observational evidence indicate that this might be the case . the h@xmath6 and radio emission are cospatial in projection in pks  0745 - 191 and in the core of ngc  1275 ( heckman et al .",
    "1989 ; ge & roberts 1993 ) .",
    "van breugel , heckman , & miley ( 1984 ) noted that there is a spatial inverse correlation between radio polarization and h@xmath6 surface brightness in abell  1795 , a result later confirmed by ge & owen ( 1993 ) at higher spatial resolution .",
    "obtaining more radio polarimetry data with high spatial resolution for cooling - flow clusters will be very helpful in testing this inverse correlation .",
    "a detailed rotation measure map will make it possible to look for a relation between the h@xmath6 luminosity of a filament and the degree of depolarization it imprints on the radio emission cospatial with it .",
    "the above discussion provides circumstantial evidence for the importance of magnetic fields in understanding cooling - flow filaments .",
    "if faraday depolarization in the optical filaments can be taken as evidence for the filaments being magnetized with a complex geometry , then magnetic field lines may be reconnecting in the nebular gas , and one would expect strong depolarization to be associated with strong optical emission . in terms of energetics ,",
    "jafelice & friaca ( 1996 ) argued , on the basis of theoretical models , that magnetic reconnection is capable of powering the lower luminosity type i filaments , but falls short of sustaining the type ii systems , such as ngc  1275 , abell  1795 , and pks  0745 - 191 .",
    "additional high spatial resolution radio polarimetry for cooling - flow galaxies is desirable in order to carry out a comparative study of the magnetic properties of the two source types .",
    "a further interesting experiment would be to obtain such data for the central galaxy in srsic 159 - 03 ( s 1101 ) , which displays filaments with emission - line ratios encompassing both type i and type ii values ( crawford & fabian 1992 ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented the results of a detailed optical spectroscopic study of the optical filaments around ngc  1275 , the central galaxy in the perseus cluster of galaxies .",
    "the database was extensive enough to yield tight upper limits on weak lines of interest for constraining the ionization and thermal state of the nebular gas .",
    "line - ratio diagrams reveal that the nebulosity has an unusual combination of emission - line strengths reflecting both low ionization and low excitation .",
    "the spectroscopic results were used to gauge the viability of several scenarios proposed for powering cooling - flow nebulosity .",
    "mechanisms examined include shocks , ionization by an agn central source or extended radio structures , stellar photoionization , and energy transfer by various means from the icm .",
    "none of these models is entirely satisfactory in accounting for the energetic and/or emission - line properties of the filaments .",
    "radio studies of faraday rotation for cooling - flow galaxies provide tantalizing suggestions that magnetic reconnection plays a significant role in the filament energetics .",
    "additional polarization studies of these sources may provide a clearer picture as to the importance of magnetic fields in these systems .",
