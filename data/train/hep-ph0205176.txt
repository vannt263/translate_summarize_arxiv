    "theoretical studies of rare decays of @xmath10 quarks have attracted increasing attention since the start of the physics programme at the @xmath5 factories at kek and slac .",
    "both @xmath5 factories are performing admirably and in excess of 60 fb@xmath11 of data has been accumulated by each experiment .",
    "the much anticipated measurement of @xmath12 has established cp violation in the @xmath5 system @xcite , while more recently evidence for cp violation in @xmath13 has been reported @xcite .",
    "many rare decays will be observed for the first time over the next few years , and measurements of their branching ratios ( brs ) will be sensitive probes of models beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the so far unobserved decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath14 ( and charged conjugates ) . in the sm",
    "these purely leptonic decays proceed via annihilation of the @xmath5 meson to a virtual @xmath15 , and offer the possibility of measuring the decay constant @xmath16 .",
    "however , in the sm the rates are helicity suppressed , and thus the largest brs are for @xmath17 .",
    "the first measurement of br@xmath18 ) is expected at belle and babar , while the sm br@xmath19 for @xmath20 is below the experimental sensitivity .",
    "@xmath3 mesons can not be produced at the @xmath4 @xmath5 factories operating at the @xmath21 , but their search is possible at hadronic machines ( tevatron run ii , lhc - b , btev ) . although br@xmath22 is considerably larger than the corresponding br for @xmath23 , the suppressed cross ",
    "section for @xmath3 production and the larger backgrounds at hadron colliders render isolation of these these decays very challenging , assuming the brs of the sm .    in models beyond the sm",
    "there can be sizeable enhancements from new particles , which may bring some of these decays within experimental observability .",
    "in particular charged higgs bosons ( @xmath24 ) @xcite and susy particles with @xmath2 parity violating interactions @xcite , can both contribute at the tree ",
    "we study the prediction for br@xmath19 and br@xmath22 in the mssm with lepton violating trilinear couplings @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , we examine the correlation between these decays and show that by allowing a second @xmath27 coupling to be non ",
    "zero , the correlation observed by previous authors can be avoided .",
    "the br@xmath22 can be enhanced to the level of 5% ( over 40% in one case ) without violating the bounds on br@xmath19 .",
    "brs of this magnitude may be in reach at the tevatron run ii and lep , with plentiful yields at lhc - b and btev .",
    "our work is organised as follows : in section 2 we give a brief introduction to the @xmath3 meson .",
    "in section 3 we introduce the annihilation decays @xmath28 , while section 4 examines the additional contributions to the decays in the mssm with @xmath2 parity violation .",
    "section 5 presents the numerical results for the brs and section 6 contains our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath3 meson is the last sm meson to be discovered @xcite .",
    "it is unique in the sense that it is composed of two heavy quarks of different flavour .",
    "it possesses no strong or electromagnetic annihilation decay channels because it carries open flavour .",
    "its mass and lifetime have been estimated by non ",
    "relativistic potential models and perturbative qcd @xcite , which predict @xmath29 gev and @xmath30 . due to its mass",
    "it can not be produced at the @xmath4 @xmath5 factories running at the @xmath21 .",
    "it can , however , be produced at lep and the tevatron , which both searched in the channels @xmath31 .",
    "lep reported a few candidate events but claimed no signal @xcite .",
    "the tevatron run i produced the first experimental evidence for the @xmath3 meson , with a sample of 20 @xmath32 events corresponding to a background fluctuation of @xmath33 , @xcite .",
    "the measured mass and lifetime were @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , in agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "this is the only experimental information on the @xmath3 meson , and hence the sm predictions for its brs have not been verified .",
    "large deviations from the sm rates are still permitted by experiment .",
    "although measurements with a precision comparable to the @xmath36 and @xmath37 systems are not expected in the near future , if new physics could affect the @xmath3 rates significantly without contradicting existing measurements in other systems , these effects could be tested at the upcoming hadronic @xmath5 machines where the @xmath3 meson accounts for approximately @xmath38 of the inclusive cross - section for all beauty hadrons .",
    "possible decay channels for the @xmath3 meson are :    * @xmath39 quark spectator , with @xmath40 quark weak decay : e.g.  @xmath31 * @xmath40 quark spectator , with @xmath39 quark weak decay * annihilation decays : @xmath41    in the sm , ( i ) and ( ii ) are expected to amount to around @xmath42 of the width , with the remaining @xmath43 coming from the annihilation decays .",
    "the latter is a much larger fraction than in the case of @xmath36 decays . from now on we will concentrate on leptonic annihilation decays .",
    "in the sm , the purely leptonic decays of @xmath46 and @xmath47 proceed via annihilation to a @xmath15 boson in the @xmath48-channel .",
    "the decay rate is given by ( where @xmath49 or @xmath39 ) : @xmath50 and one expects : @xmath51 these decays are relatively much more important for @xmath3 than @xmath36 due to the enhancement factor @xmath52 .",

    "this particularly applies to lep and the tevatron which can produce both @xmath36 and @xmath3 mesons but have not searched for the majority of the annihilation channels .",
    "cleo and the @xmath5 factories have already reported strong limits on @xmath0 decays for @xmath20 .",
    "the best limit on @xmath73 decays comes from the l3 collaboration . in the search for @xmath73 at lep @xcite",
    "there is a sizeable contribution from @xmath74 , which has the same experimental signature @xcite .",
    "thus the experimental limit constrains the br of an admixture of @xmath36 and @xmath3 , and the effective limit on the process @xmath74 depends strongly on the conversion probability @xmath75 ( 0.02%0.1% ) @xcite . for lower estimates of the conversion probability ,",
    "the present experimental limit puts a bound of the order of the sm width on @xmath74 .",
    "therefore future , more precise bounds on @xmath73 from high energy machines and/or a better knowledge of the @xmath75 conversion probability will start to put meaningful constraints on br@xmath76 .",
    "neither the lep collaborations nor the tevatron run i searched for the channels @xmath77 and no limits whatsoever exist for @xmath78 .",
    "while neither lep nor tevatron run i could be competitive with the @xmath5 factories in setting bounds for @xmath79 , attempts to measure this quantity could actually pick up a signal from @xmath80 . in the next section",
    "we shall show that in susy models with @xmath2 parity violation , the decays @xmath1 may be enhanced sufficiently to bring them within experimental sensitivity of both lep and tevatron , thereby motivating a search in these channels . more specifically , assuming an optimistic @xmath75 conversion probability of @xmath81 , a measurement that gives a limit of @xmath82 on the @xmath79 channels may be able to detect @xmath80 brs of @xmath83 .",
    "due to the current meagre experimental information on the decays of @xmath3 mesons , future measurements of their brs may be a test of models beyond the sm .",
    "it is entirely possible that its brs are very different from the sm predictions .",
    "the expected yield of @xmath3 mesons from run ii at the tevatron is @xmath85 , increasing to @xmath86 at lhc - b and btev @xcite .",

    "new physics contributions to the decays have been studied by a few authors . @xcite",
    "considered the effects of @xmath24 on the decays @xmath44 , while @xcite extended this analysis to the case of @xmath45 . in both cases",
    "the @xmath24 contribution modifies the sm prediction by a factor @xmath2 where : @xmath87    since the sm predictions for @xmath88 are already very small ( see table [ explimits ] ) , the @xmath24 contribution can not enhance them to current experimental observability . on the other hand , the @xmath24 contribution can saturate the current experimental bounds on @xmath62 . the delphi search for @xmath62 constrains @xmath89 ( @xmath42 c.l . ) which strengthens to @xmath90 if the @xmath3 contribution is included @xcite .",

    "the @xmath5 factories with @xmath92 fb@xmath11 will be sensitive to brs of the order of the sm prediction and thus the first measurement of @xmath62 is expected , unless its br is suppressed by some new physics contribution ( @xmath24 or otherwise ) .",
    "the mssm with @xmath2 parity violating trilinear couplings predicts extra contributions to @xmath93 from tree level slepton or squark exchange .",
    "it has been shown that these contributions can be sizeable @xcite .",
