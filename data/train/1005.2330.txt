    "the detection of cosmic @xmath0-rays is essentially based on either direct or indirect methods . the former uses satellised high - energy particle physics type detectors , based on the tracking of the @xmath0-ray pair conversion and the calorimetry of the subsequent electromagnetic cascade .",
    "this technique is constrained almost by definition in weight , size and power consumption , which limits respectively the maximal @xmath0-ray energy , the effective area , and the dynamic range .",
    "they have however a large field of view ( fov ) , almost avoiding any need for pointed observations since the performance of the instrument ( angular and energy resolution ) changes slowly within the fov . with livetimes close to 90% ,",
    "space - based observatories provide some of the best continuous monitoring of the high - energy sky ever realized .",
    "the indirect methods rely on the detection of the secondary particles induced by the @xmath0-ray pair creation in the atmosphere .",
    "this can be done directly on the ground , with large area all - weather water erenkov detectors or air shower detectors ( such as milagro and argo - ybj ) at the price of @xmath2tev energy thresholds and poor background rejection .",
    "another technique consist in the indirect detection of the air cascade at energies @xmath3 , using the faint optical erenkov flash of the shower with atmospheric erenkov telescopes ( acts ) , with the drawback of having a limited livetime @xmath4 due to the same constraint as ground - based optical telescopes of clear , dark night skies for carrying out observations limiting light curves to be continuous only over a time up to @xmath5 , with varying sensitivities and energy thresholds due to the specifics of this technique . since such cascades , or even the erenkov light pool , have transverse sizes @xmath6",
    ", the effective area can be much larger than the physical size of the detector itself , and , provided an efficient hadronic background , have a tremendous sensitivity .",
    "clearly , space- and ground - based instruments are extremely complementary , and are very likely to remain so until much larger @xmath0-ray detectors can be put in space .      after a long generation of @xmath0-ray detectors based on moderately precise spark - chambers technology running on expandable gas , such as sas-2 ( 1972 - 1973 ) , cos - b ( 1975 - 1982 ) and egret ( on board of _ cgro _ , 1991 - 2000 ) , the newest and most recent observatories _ agile _ and _ fermi_-lat use robust and finely segmented silicon - based trackers , improving the angular resolution by an order of magnitude but also increasing the fov up to about @xmath7 through a more compact design .",
    "the lat onboar _ fermi _ detects @xmath0-rays in the range @xmath8@xmath9 where the lowest energy is limited by the background and the highest energy mostly by statistics .",
    "the whole sky is covered within two orbits , or @xmath10 , with an integrated flux sensitivity above @xmath11 of @xmath12 and @xmath13 for respectively galactic and extragalactic ones , providing among the longest light curves ever recorded@xcite .",
    "an extremely important figure is that the lat detects the crab nebula , a standard candle used in tev astronomy , within a year at @xmath14@xcite , an energy usually defined as the border between high energy ( he , @xmath15 ) and very high energy ( vhe , @xmath16 ) where acts become sensitive .",
    "of crucial importance for agn studies evoked here is of course the lat s uniform all - sky monitoring capabilities along with its efficiency , allowing observers at any other wavelength to have ( almost ) guaranteed gev observations of their favourite sources without need to apply for observations . within a year",
    ", the lat has collected @xmath17 @xmath0-rays , 2 orders of magnitude more than its predecessor .",
    "the first _ fermi _ catalog@xcite ( 1fgl ) , based on 11 months of scientific operations , contains 1451 sources of which 1043 are at galactic latitudes @xmath18 . from this latter sample",
    "was then derived the first lat agn catalog ( 1lac ) , comprising 300 bl lac objects ( compared to 13 for egret ) , 296 flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs , of which egret saw 66 ) , and 113 agn of other ( or unknown ) type .",
    "this is a tremendous change of the he sky with just one of the 10 expected years of scientific operations , so even more is to be expected in the future .",
    "# 1    ( # 1 )      the most sensitive extensive air shower ( eas ) detector to date is the milagro observatory , which has provided a 1 to 100 tev survey of the @xmath0-ray sky in which 34 _ galactic _ _ fermi _ sources were found@xcite .",
    "so far however acts have been the dominant technique for studying the vhe extragalactic field , since the @xmath0-ray horizon at tev energies is ( at best ) located at @xmath19 due to photon - photon interactions with the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .    the new generation of major acts ( hess , magic and veritas mainly ) , with larger telescopes and improved reconstruction techniques , have augmented the flux sensitivity of this technique by an order of magnitude within a decade , reaching a significance of 5 standard deviations on crab nebula type sources in @xmath20 or less , and ways are found to decrease the effect of moonlight in order to increase the observation time .",
    "the population of extragalactic `` tev sources '' is currently at 30 , but continuously increasing , as can be seen in fig .",
    "most of the sources are bl lacs with fluxes at the level of a few percent of the crab nebula equivalent , with little measurable variability .",
    "while it is widely accepted that blazar @xmath0-ray emission originates from inverse compton emission in an ultrarelativistic jet pointing within a few degrees of our line of sight , it is still not clear where in the jet this emission occurs , nor what the source of the scattered soft photons is . beyond these questions , it has also yet to be established what role the central black hole exactly plays in the mechanism that powers the jet . the extremely efficient release of binding energy of accreting gas , as well as directly extracting spin energy from the black hole through the blandford - znajek mechanism@xcite , are possible .",
    "the newly available means to perform @xmath0-ray multi - wavelength monitoring of the nonthermal emission will certainly provide clues for a better understanding about the jet composition , and perhaps about jet formation as well .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars in @xmath21 representation usually has two broad components , with the lower one generally believed to be synchrotron radiation , and the higher one inverse compton ( ic ) radiation from the same electrons on target photons which can have different origins .    at the time",
    "this review is being written , all but 4 of the grand ensemble of extragalactic @xmath0-ray sky sources are seen by _ fermi _ , so the global he spectral characteristics can be well summarized by the 1lac sample . fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) shows that the he @xmath0-ray index @xmath22 becomes harder when the synchrotron peak shifts globally blueward .",
    "this should be compared with fig .  2 in ref .  ,",
    "displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , where this trend was first seen using only egret blazars , but with 37 fsrqs and 13 bl lacs .",
    "it appears hence that the fsrq @xmath0-ray spectra are different from the bl lac population , with the average photon index of the former being @xmath23 , while the average photon index of the latter is @xmath24 .",
    "the blazar index versus luminosity characteristics as seen by _ fermi _ appear also to largely follow the so - called blazar sequence@xcite , based on a one zone , homogeneous synchrotron self - compton and external compton model , where the peak luminosities of the two radiative components are located at increasingly higher frequencies when the observed @xmath0-ray luminosity decreases , and where the external compton cooling becomes progressively more inefficient than the self - compton .    on the other side ,",
    "the _ observed _ vhe spectra from all extragalactic objects have photon indexes @xmath25 , so the combination of _ fermi _ and acts constrains for almost all bl lacs the peak of the observed sed ( in @xmath21 representation)@xcite .",
    "this should now allow the best characterization ever made of both components of the sed , the monitoring with unprecedented accuracy of how these components evolve , and how they are related .",
    "the fsrq class of blazars are the most powerful @xmath0-ray emitters as well as the most luminous .",
    "this is best illustrated by the gigantic flare@xcite exhibited by 3c 454.3 on december 2 , 2009 , when it reached a flux of @xmath26 , which is up to date the brightest transient ever detected in the he range . for comparison ,",
    "the brightest persistent source in the he sky is the vela pulsar , at about half that flux .",
    "this population is also extremely variable , and their spectra show significant spectral curvature in the he range . since _",
    "fermi _ probes these sources mostly at their peak luminosity frequency , and with unprecedented resolution , theorists working on fsrqs are guaranteed to have a field day .",
    "the detection of the fsrq 3c279@xcite at @xmath27 during an optical flare in 2006 by the magic experiment at the @xmath28 level and a dedicated low - energy analysis was the first of this kind with an act .",
    "the corresponding gev flux , had _ fermi _ been there to see it , would have been a really exceptional state , an order of magnitude higher than the highest gev flux seen so far on this source , as is pointed out in ref .   in order to match the _ fermi _ extrapolation to higher energies assuming a conservative ebl attenuation and no further spectral steepening .",
    "this detection is clearly paving the way for upcoming acts with @xmath29 thresholds , which could probe the fsrq compton component variability at timescales not accessible to _ fermi _ , and eventually find out whether they can exhibit very fast variability as well .",
    "the most constraining observations on jet kinematics and the @xmath0-ray emitting region probably come from agn observations with acts , mostly the high - frequency peaked class of bl lac objects ( hbls ) , which can exhibit minute - timescale variability in their vhe @xmath0-ray fluxes , as has been shown by the hess and magic experiments in pks  2155 - 304@xcite and mkn  501@xcite , respectively .",
    "these findings have given raise to considerable theoretical developments in the literature@xcite , as existing models have to struggle to either remain simple but invoke uncomfortably large bulk lorentz factors of 100 or higher in order to allow @xmath30 @xmath0-rays to escape from the compact area , or use multiple emitting zones , or the emission region becomes very small@xcite .",
    "intruigingly , the power density spectrum of one of the giant flares of pks 2155 - 304 shows no sign of high - frequency cutoff in the red noise power law distribution up to the poisson noise level , so it can not be excluded that even faster variability could be detected in the light curves if they were sampled by more sensitive instruments ( or if the fluxes were higher ) .",
    "the bl lac object pks  2155 - 304 was also the first source of this type to be targeted during a simultaneous space - ground multi - wavelength campaign in 2009 involving _ _ fermi__@xcite .",
    "observing the soft spectrum of the archival egret measurements on this object would have been quite disconcerting since the this soft spectrum is incompatible with a smooth connection to the lowest known vhe spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and would therefore rule out a single radiative ic population .",
    "the _ fermi _ observations during this campaign turned out to be actually in good agreement with the simultaneous vhe spectrum , and provided the first simultaneous ic characterization of an hbl .",
    "an interesting feature of this campaign was that the x - ray and vhe light curves , despite significant variability , were not correlated , when the vhe and optical fluxes appeared to be correlated to some degree .",
    "while the latter correlations have yet to be confirmed and understood , the observed x - ray / vhe behaviour could actually be reproduced with a simple ssc model since the highest electrons , those radiating the x - rays through the synchrotron mechanism , are barely noticed at vhe energies due to a combination of large klein - nishina suppression , a low density of target photons , and ebl attenuation .    with the advent of quasi - continuous , well - sampled observations of flaring bl  lac objects , vhe @xmath0-ray",
    "light curves can now be characterized beyond finding the fastest doubling / halving time scales .",
    "tools commonly used in x - ray observations can now usefully be applied to the _ whole _ data set instead of picking the most interesting part of it ( or at least what might look as such ) . in this way it has now been established that , at least for pks  2155 - 304 , the 2006 flaring state is compatible with a stationary lognormal process@xcite whose power spectum density is red noise , sharing a characteristic of accreting sources shining with thermal radiation such as cyg x-1 or some seyfert galaxies for instance .",
    "this might be important enough that it should be sought for not only in the other jet - dominated non - thermal emissions from agn , but also again in the same source to find out whether the psd slope or lognormal factor are subject to changes .",
    "its eventual ubiquity would also have to be reproduced by time - dependent emission models .",
    "not much was known about bl lac objects in the he range , so it was not clear until _ fermi _ started observing what exactly was happening in that regime , i.e. whether bl lacs were just very faint , or if they were bright at higher energies where egret s sensitivity dropped .",
    "it was hence surprising to find many hard bl lac objects among the bright sources seen by _ _",
    "their spectra are generally power laws over 3 decades in energy , with sometimes small deviations at energies @xmath31 .",
    "the overall sed is rather unsurprising , as the high end of the he and the low end of the vhe spectra tend to be well within range , and in some cases even slightly overlap , since a few of the hardest sources with he indexes of @xmath32 have a spectral bin as high as @xmath33 .",
    "a rather special case is the hbl pg 115 + 113 , of unknown redshift , which has the largest spectral difference ( @xmath34 ) between the he and the vhe regimes . since",
    "its distance is still unknown , it can not be ruled out that the observed large spectral break is not related to the source but to the @xmath0-ray propagation@xcite .",
    "this source , like many other bl lacs visible in both the he and vhe ranges , exhibits surprisingly little variability in either energy band@xcite over long time scales when it is actually known to be largely variable at x - ray and optical wavelengths .",
    "there are high hopes that _ fermi _ , given its intra - day overall sky surveillance and the fact that it shares the same radiative population as vhe instruments , will prove to be a more efficient provider of flaring states in blazars of interest for acts than all - sky x - ray monitors such as the asm onboard _ rossi - xte _ or the bat onboard _",
    "swift_. but looking at the rich astronomer s telegram history of _ fermi _ the very variable extragalactic sky is so far essentially composed of fsrqs and a low - frequency peaked bl lac .      unlike most blazars , high frequency vlbi can probe the jets in a few selected vhe sources like m87 and centaurus a@xcite down to size scales  100 gravitational radii@xcite . getting closer to localise the source of the @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "these sources are widely supposed to be the unbeamed parent population of blazars , so even observations at large angles of the jet can provide valuable insights of jet physics .",
    "in m87 , it was possible to establish that the acceleration and the collimation of the jet occurs within @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is the schwarzschild radius of the central black hole , a very important size in such systems ) . a joint act campaign , along with vlba observations , has revealed that an increase of the nucleus radio flux might be the lagged counterpart of a similar vhe @xmath0-ray transient , implying that the @xmath0-ray emission , and hence the acceleration of the underlying radiative population , is likely to happen well within the collimation region@xcite .",
    "scenarios to explain how @xmath0-ray variability can be detected in off - axis jet systems include e.g. a multiblob ssc model similar to those used for blazar emission@xcite , a two - zone spine - sheath layer mechanism@xcite , and pulsar - type acceleration due to centrifugally accelerated electrons in a rotating jet magnetosphere@xcite .",
    "unifications of these scenarios with the beamed population is going to be an interesting development to follow in the future , as well as its long - term he characterization by _",
    "fermi_.    another possible emerging population of @xmath0-ray emitting agn unseen before _",
    "fermi _ are the narrow - line seyfert-1 galaxies ( nls1 ) of which up to now 4 have been detected@xcite .",
    "it was not completely unexpected that the rather rare radio - loud sample of nls1 galaxies could be also high - energy emitters since in some scenarios they are probably have a pole - on orientation@xcite .",
    "the he spectra are however extremely steep so , given their distance , nothing is expected to be visible by acts by extrapolating the _ fermi _ spectra , but suprises can arise given the rather complex seds which leave probably more room open to radically different models than there is for bl lac models .",
    "photons of energy @xmath37 can create an electron / positron pair when colliding with target photons of energy @xmath38 provided that @xmath39 , which makes photons in the @xmath11@xmath40 range sensitive to various existing cosmic backgrounds@xcite and especially those in the far uv - far ir range ( usually called the _ extragalactic background light _ , or ebl ) , since they have the relevant density to adversely affect the vhe extragalactic spectra when the sources are located at cosmological distances .",
    "due to difficulties in subtracting local galactic foregrounds , this part of the cosmic background is poorly enough constrained that @xmath0-ray attenuation can be a useful tool to probe the ebl at energies despite all the uncertainties in the intrinsic emitted spectrum@xcite .",
    "bl lac objects can be used for this since the radiative particle distribution is expected to be close to the injection function , for which theoretical constraints exist , because the lorentz factor @xmath41 at which electrons cool within the dissipative region is expected to be large enough@xcite that the radiative electron spectrum is not affected within a time @xmath42 .",
    "the use of such constraints turn out to be so far the most efficient way to constrain the ebl and hence properties of star formation rate and early population iii stars@xcite . the fsrq class , despite the advantage of being at larger distances on average than bl lacs ,",
    "might be more tricky to use for such purposes , since not only much faster cooling time scales deviate the radiative spectrum faster from the injected one , but also because significant @xmath0-ray absorption is expected inside the source itself@xcite .",
    "another original use of ebl attenuation is the possibility to constrain the hubble constant@xcite .",
    "it seems however that , at least for distant bl lacs ( @xmath43 ) , most of the vhe spectra contain photons up to hundreds of gev , but rarely up to tev energies .",
    "interestingly , extending the _ fermi _ spectrum by ( just ) one decade , along with a conservative ebl attenuation model , reproduces the vhe spectra quite well .",
    "this could mean that , for most of those hard _",
    "fermi _ sources ,",
    "the _ observed _ sed peak is not necessarily the _ intrinsic _ luminosity peak , which could be in some cases be located at energies well above @xmath44 .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig5 ] , where a clear evolution of the observed spectral break with the redshift is possibly a model - independent signature of the increasing effect of ebl attenuation , further complicating the characterization of the intrinsic emission .",
    "if it was well known that high - energy @xmath0-rays can be an interesting probe of the contents of the space they travel through , that they can also be a probe of space _ itself _ is a rather new and at least as interesting development .",
    "it appears that some models for quantum gravity predict an energy - dependence on the speed of light through lorentz invariance violation@xcite , which can be probed when high - energy gamma - rays travel over cosmological distances .",
    "this has in turn been searched for by quantifying possible energy - dependent lags in agn light curves ( assuming no intrinsic time - effect cause ) , which has provided some of the most constraining upper limits to the energy scale at which this happens ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "besides high expectations for the coming years of _ fermi _ results , the act systems have also upgrading plans which will improve the vhe knowledge of the sky .",
    "the magic collaboration is now operating a second large telescope , and the hess collaboration is building a central large telescope which will operate with the 4 smaller ones .",
    "a major change will come from the construction of larger cherenkov observatories such as the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) or the advanced gamma - ray imaging system ( agis ) , with sensitivities improving by an order of magnitude at @xmath45 and a lower energy threshold .",
    "however , in the most optimistic case , this is not likely to happen before the next marcel grossmann meeting , which will be a more appropriate venue to discuss these developments in further details .",
