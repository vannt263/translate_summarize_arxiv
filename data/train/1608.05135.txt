    "however , the qubit s pure dephasing , @xmath39 , will not reduce even when decoupled from the tl .",
    "now we study the effects of the flux qubit pure dephasing and observe ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fce ] ) , as pure dephasing increases , the fidelity to the ideal target entangled state exponentially decays to that of a completely mixed state , @xmath215 .",
    "similarly , the concurrence also exponentially decays to zero and the entanglement disappears .",
    "in contrast , the right and left moving photon excitation probabilities are equal @xmath216 and independent of dephasing .",
    "thus , for large dephasing the system classically randomly routes the single photon into a mixture of right- and left - moving modes .",
    "next we show how to transfer quantum state between the `` flying '' photonic qubit and the `` static '' flux qubit with the help of quantum measurement .",
    "as discussed above , for a right - moving single photon and the flux qubit prepared initially in the state of @xmath125 , our hybrid quantum system can generate an entangled state @xmath217 . here",
    "we neglect the small phase @xmath134 and the spatial dependent phase @xmath130 , which only indicates the opposite propagation directions .",
    "we rewrite the state @xmath214 as @xmath218 in the bell state basis of the flux qubit , where @xmath50 .",
    "clearly , heralded quantum state transfer can be conducted by measuring the state of the `` static '' flux qubit in the bell basis .",
    "a measurement yielding @xmath219 projects the `` flying '' photonic qubit to @xmath220 . here",
    "we neglect the travail global phase of @xmath221",
    ". the success probability can be @xmath222 .",
    "if we obtain @xmath223 during the measurement , we need induce a @xmath221 phase shift in either path of the photon .",
    "thus , we can do a measurement - based heralded quantum state transfer from the `` static '' flux qubit to the `` flying '' photonic qubit .",
    "we now provide an estimate for the performance of our device for entangling the traveling single photon and the flux qubit , prepared in the superposition state of @xmath180 , based on feasible experimental parameters .",
    "the decay rate @xmath224 of a single siv is about @xmath225 corresponding to a lifetime of @xmath226 @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we use @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "the applied single - photon pulse has a duration of @xmath229 .",
    "the challenging requirements in the realization of our system are three - fold : ( i ) large single - spin zeeman shift ; ( ii ) the long decoherence time of the flux qubit ; ( iii ) a strong coupling between the nanowaveguide and the atom yielding a purcell factor larger than @xmath230 . using a flux qubit with a persistent current of @xmath166 and",
    "a flux concentrator we can achieve a coupling strength of @xmath231 . in a recent experiment @xcite , the flux qubit exhibited a longitudinal lifetime of @xmath232 and a decoherence time of @xmath233 giving a pure dephasing rate @xmath234 @xcite .",
    "thus we have @xmath235 .",
    "since the transmission line is terminated by a squid we assume that through appropriate tuning we can eliminate all longitudinal relaxation of the flux qubit , giving @xmath236 during the single photon pulse .",
    "recent progress in nanowaveguide qed has achieved the strong coupling regime with a purcell factor larger than @xmath237 through a variety of methods : using a nanofiber @xcite , or a dielectric slot nanowaveguide @xcite , or a photonic crystal waveguide @xcite or a plasmonic nanowire @xcite .",
    "we use a purcell factor of @xmath238 to achieve the strong coupling regime in our estimation . using these realistic numbers for parameters in the master equation model",
    ", we achieve a high fidelity of @xmath239 and entanglement with a large concurrence of @xmath240 . throughout our numerical investigation",
    ", we require @xmath241 .",
    "considering the large dipole moment of siv , this classical rabi frequency can be reached with a weak laser field .",
    "in summary , we can conditionally control the routing of a single photon wavepacket by the quantum state of a flux qubit via quantum magnetic tuning of the position of an eit window in a single siv color center interacting strongly with the single photon .",
    "our scheme can create a quantum state of a flying single photon dependent on the quantum state of a flux quibt .",
    "the proposed device can act as a hybrid quantum interface and creates entanglement between the mw and optical regimes .",
    "the atom in the implementation of our device can be , but is not limited to the siv defect .",
    "it can be nv centers in nanodiamond , rare earth ions in nanoscrystal or alkali atoms .",
