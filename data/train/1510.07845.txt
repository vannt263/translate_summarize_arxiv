    ", we have used a 2000 point equidistant grid with @xmath78 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for stronger interactions . for the time - evolution of the com variance",
    ", we have used 600 point equidistant grid with @xmath83 for both @xmath55 and @xmath40 simulations .",
    "we have assured ourselves that the results are converged with respect to changes in these parameters and those of time and space discretization .",
    "in addition , we have compared the qiwib results against an independent implementation of mctdhb @xcite , which produced identical results at the reported accuracy .",
    "the simulations of the quench dynamics are performed in two steps : ( 1 ) relaxation to the ground state of the harmonic trap and ( 2 ) time propagation after turning off the trap .",
    "it follows from very general principles that observables linked only to the com wave function are independent of the interaction strength for at most harmonic potentials or constant gauge fields .",
    "here we demonstrate this explicitly for the com variance and a many particle system governed by the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( 1 ) . for this purpose",
    "we write an arbitrary initial quantum state as @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a complete basis set which depends only on the com and @xmath86 is a complete basis set which depends on the @xmath13 relative motion degrees - of - freedom .",
    "we further write the time evolution of the many - body wavefunction as ( @xmath87 ) @xmath88 in eq .  , the total hamiltonian was written as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the com hamiltonian and the remaining terms , including the interaction - dependent operators , form @xmath91 .",
    "then we can explicitly write @xmath92 the dynamics of the second moment of the com wave function is obtained as @xmath93 from the last line of eq .",
    "it can be seen that the result is independent of the interaction strength during the time evolution .",
    "the time evolution of the com variance thus depends only on the initial state ( through the expansion coefficients @xmath94 ) and the external potential through the com hamiltonian @xmath90 .",
    "this fact can be used as a sanity check for mctdhb simulations , which , if fully converged , should produce the same time evolution for the com variance for different values of the interaction strength .",
    "the ground state of @xmath65 particles in a time - independent harmonic trap with frequency @xmath38 is described by a product of the center - of - mass ( com ) and relative motion wave functions : @xmath95 .",
    "the analytical form of the com wave function is @xmath96 where @xmath97 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relative motion wave function with the normalization constant @xmath98 and harmonic oscillator length scale , @xmath99 , can be obtained as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the relative coordinate , @xmath102 is the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind and @xmath103 comes from the discontinuity in the first derivative due to the delta interaction @xcite .",
    "explicitly , @xmath103 is calculated by solving the transcendental equation @xmath104 the ground - state energy is given by @xmath105 and the exact results for the natural occupancy are obtained by numerically diagonalizing of the single particle density matrix @xmath106    after turning off the trap , the gaussian com wave function expands .",
    "in particular , the time evolution of the com wave function represents the textbook example of gaussian wave propagation @xcite @xmath107 } \\biggr).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the com wave function spreads leading to a variance increasing quadratically in time @xmath108.\\ ] ] the relative motion after trap release , on the other hand , is dominated by the bound state of the attractive @xmath109 interactions . indeed",
    ", since the @xmath109 function has exactly one bound state , near the origin the relative motion wave function will approach this bound state in the long time - limit and possible other contributions from scattering state will disperse . the initial relative motion wave function can be expressed in terms of the bound state and scattering states : @xmath110 , where the bound state is @xmath111 .",
    "then , the expected variance of the relative motion wave function in the long time limit must be @xmath112 .",
    "in the main text we have demonstrated the ambiguity of the studying the eigenvalues of the single - particle density matrix , the natural occupations , for a specific mctdhb simulation . for @xmath65 particles we are able to vary the number of modes @xmath0 over a good range , which permits a conventional study of convergence with respect to mode number .",
    "it is further possible to analyse the shape of the two - particle wave function in the mctdhb approximation , which sheds some light on the unphysical coupling of relative and com motion in the truncated multi - mode expansion .",
    "we test the convergence by checking whether relevant quantities , e.g.  the variational ground - state energy , remain unchanged as the number of modes @xmath0 is increased .",
    "the results in table  [ tab1 ] are still varying at the level of several percent between @xmath113 and @xmath40 and thus indicate , correctly , that the mctdhb expansion converges very slowly and is not yet fully converged with 10 modes . while this way of testing convergence is reliable and has produced the correct answer , varying @xmath0 from one to ten modes is a luxury that can only be afforded for small particle numbers @xmath5 . in simulations with hundreds to thousands of particles ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the options for choosing @xmath0 are severely limited due to the unfavorable scaling of numerical effort when both @xmath5 and @xmath0 are large .",

    "[ fig : m5m10gspop ] , we present the dependence of the natural occupation on the interaction parameter .",
    "a couple of remarks pointing to the ambiguity of this convergence indicator are in order .",
    "first , by looking at the results for @xmath40 and @xmath122 one is tempted to conclude that mctdhb has already converged since three orbitals are below @xmath123 .",
    "but , we know from fig .  [ fig : r2r2 ] that for the same interaction strength the mctdhb com variance is still far from the exact value .",
    "second , it can be seen that all the natural occupations , except for the highest one , are shifted up as the number of single - particle modes @xmath0 is increased .",
    "this further exemplifies the failure of the convergence requirement based on the lowest occupancy .",
    "for example , the 5th lowest natural occupation at @xmath124 is below @xmath125 for @xmath126 , while this is not true for @xmath40 , where the 5th single - particle mode is now above the cut - off value .     for ( a ) @xmath126 and ( b ) @xmath40 .",
    "the dashed horizontal line denotes the convergence criterion of @xmath127 . ]",
    "lastly , we look at the rate of convergence for observables , in particular the ground state energy and the single - particle density variance , as depicted in fig .  [ fig : convm ] .",
    "we find that the mctdhb results approach the exact values with a slow power law as a function of the number of single - particle modes @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath128 .",
    "the empirical exponent @xmath103 lies between @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which indicates slightly faster convergence than the @xmath130 leading exponent of the full - ci expansion of two 1d bosons with point interaction in a fixed harmonic oscillator basis @xcite .",
    "we note that this power - law behavior only sets in for mode numbers larger than @xmath131 in this case and the convergence rate is significantly slower for smaller @xmath0 .",
    "this may be because the variational optimisation of the modes is particularly effective for small @xmath0 .",
    "it also means , however , that in the pre - power - law regime of @xmath132 increasing the number of modes brings even less effect than the empirical power law would suggest that governs larger regimes of @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , for particle numbers in the hundreds or larger , the scaling of computational resources practically limits the application of mctdhb exactly to the small @xmath0 regime .     for @xmath124 : ( a ) ground - state energy and ( b ) single - particle density variance . dashed horizontal lines correspond to the exact values .",
    "symbols denote the mctdhb results for different @xmath0 .",
    "the exponent of the power law fit , @xmath103 , is also shown .",
    "( inset ) log - log plot of the absolute difference between the exact and mctdhb results . ]      in order to understand how mctdhb deals with the competing length scales and why it violates the separation of com and relative motion , it is instructive to plot the two particle density , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2body ] for @xmath65 .",
    "in these plots , the diagonal ( @xmath133 ) represents the com coordinate @xmath134 and the antidiagonal ( @xmath135 ) the relative motion coordinate @xmath136 .",
    "while the left hand panels relate to the ground state of @xmath137 , the right hand panels relate to a later time @xmath138 after trap release . here",
    "the com wave function has expanded significantly according to eq .",
    ", whereas the relative - motion bound state is hardly changed .",
    "the upper two panels show the exact result and panel ( b ) clearly demonstrates the diverging length scales .",
    "note the changing spatial scale between panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the middle panels ( c ) and ( d ) present the @xmath1 ( gross - pitaevskii ) result . at this level ,",
    "the com and relative motion length scales are identical because the product form of the state with a single mode function @xmath139 together with the inversion symmetry of the problem forces a four - fold symmetry and leaves no option to distinguish the two diagonal directions . for long times",
    ", the wave function expands in both directions and the com and relative motion length scales are identical .",
    "the lower panels ( e ) and ( f ) report an mctdhb simulation with @xmath126 modes .",

    "[ fig:2body](f ) shows five separated peaks with each one exhibiting a four - fold symmetry and resembling the @xmath1 result , albeit on a different scale . as the mctdhb expansion is a sum over symmetrized product states , different numbers of modes @xmath0 will produce up to @xmath0 peaks with diagonal  off diagonal symmetry .",
    "thus for given @xmath0 , the com and relative motion are strongly coupled and expansion dynamics , where the com length scale grows over time , will not be captured correctly . furthermore , this discretised behavior due to finite @xmath0 leads to an impractical number of @xmath0 needed to correctly model the limit of a delocalised com but localised relative motion .     for @xmath137 at different times : left [ ( a),(c),(e ) ] @xmath140 and right [ ( b),(d),(f ) ] @xmath141 .",

    "the function @xmath160 can be further interpreted as the mean - density for a fixed com position .",
    "this can be justified by following ref .",
    "we write the single - particle density in this case as @xmath161 the integration over @xmath162 can be easily done due to the presence of the @xmath109-function leading to @xmath163 again we transform the integration variables using eq .   such that @xmath164 , where we define @xmath165 this yields @xmath166",
    "lastly , we integrate over the @xmath167 to find that indeed @xmath160 is equal to @xmath168 , @xmath169    it is straightforward to show that the variances add in a convolution provided that at least one of the functions is centered at the origin ( in our case the com wave function ) : @xmath170 where @xmath171 , @xmath172 and the functions @xmath173 and @xmath160 are normalized to unity . from eq .  , it can be deduced that the width of the exact single - particle density will always be greater than the width of the com wave function , @xmath174 and the equality is satisfied in the limit of large interaction coupling @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "moreover , the variance of the relative motion density for an untrapped state is smaller than the untrapped case , i.e. , @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is an excellent approximation of the untrapped relative motion variance that becomes exact for large @xmath5 @xcite .",
