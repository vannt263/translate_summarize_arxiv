    "monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides mx@xmath1 ( tmds ) ( transition metal m = mo , w ; chalcogen x = s , se ) have recently attracted great attention because of their distinctive electronic and optical properties differing from their corresponding bulk materials .",
    "these properties present a vast arena of potential applications@xcite such as optoelectronics and valleytronics , quantum informatics and spintronics .",
    "one of the most significantly properties of these monolayer materials arising from the reduced dimensionality and dielectric screening is the strong coulomb interaction between electrons and holes .",
    "this leads to the formation of tightly bound excitons and large exciton binding energies , which implies a rich excitonic physics in these monolayer materials@xcite .",
    "there were a number of works have been focused on the excitonic properties of these monolayer materials in both experiment and theory , particularly on the exciton binding energies . in theoretical aspect ,",
    "first - principle calculation based on gw and bethe - salpeter equation ( gw - bse ) approach were used extensively to investigate the excitonic states and binding energy@xcite .",
    "the very large exciton binding energies in the range of 0.5@xmath21 ev are predicted and confirmed by many consequent experiments such as the photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy@xcite , femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and microscopy@xcite , the optical reflection spectra@xcite , time - resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy@xcite . within the frame of wannier - mott exciton ,",
    "the simple hydrogenic model is also employed@xcite , in which the usual rydberg series of energy levels of the excitonic states are obtained and applied to explain several experimental results successfully@xcite .",
    "however , the pronounced deviation from the usual hydrogenic model in the several lower excitonic levels were also observed in experiments@xcite .",

    "in addition , several exciton complexes and the corresponding binding energies are investigated by using the fractional dimensional space approach@xcite , in which the exciton binding energy depends on the modulation of the dimensionality parameter @xmath6 , which underlies the confinement effects of various geometrical structures .",
    "in fact that the agreements between experiments and theories are obtained as above mentioned works . however , from the comparison of the obtained binding energies in experiments and theoretical models , it can be concluded that the causes regarding exciton binding energies can be varied in a large scale are still not clearly and the values of exciton binding energies for the same monolayer tmds in various experiments and theoretical models can not get inconsistent .",

    "1(a ) presents the dependence of exciton binding energies on the cut - off wave vector @xmath7 at @xmath92 . as can be seen that exciton binding energies decrease with increasing the cut - off wave vector .",
    "when the @xmath7 reaches above the value of @xmath93 , the effect of @xmath7 on exciton binding energies becomes insignificant , which means that only the phonons with small wave - vector , corresponding to the long - wave length phonons , are strongly coupled with the charge carriers , which is consistent with the results that small - momentum optical phonons give the mainly contributions to the fr@xmath0hlich interaction based on first - principle calculation@xcite .",
    "indeed , the influence of cut - off wave vector ( @xmath7 ) of lo and so phonon mode on the exciton binding energies are similar in following section , so we choose @xmath94 as the limitation value for all numerical calculations presented in this paper . on the other hand ,",

    "( 3 ) and ( 15 ) , it can be known that the corrections of exciton - so phonon coupling to exciton binding energies depend on the cut - off wave vector @xmath7 , polarization parameter of substrate @xmath96 and distance @xmath4 .",

    "3(a ) , exciton binding energies in monolayer mos@xmath1 for different polar substrate are presented at distance @xmath4=0.5 nm . comparing with fig .",
    "2(a ) , it can be seen that the correction of exciton binding energies are enhanced more obviously with increasing @xmath7 due to two branches of so phonon modes included . moreover , the corrections increase from h - bn to zro@xmath1 substrates , which because of the polarization parameter @xmath96 that denotes the polarization strength of substrates increases from h - bn to zro@xmath1 substrates as table ii listed .",
    "the increasing of this parameter denotes the enhanced strength of exciton - so phonons coupling , and thus resulting in the correction effect more stronger .",
    "therefore , the polarization of substrate plays a significant role on the exciton binding energies in these monolayer materials .",
    "however , the coupling strength between exciton and so phonons can be modulated by the distance @xmath4 as plotted in fig .",
    "3(b ) . from it",
    ", we can see that the corrections of exciton binding energies decrease sharply and can be varied in range of several hundreds of mev for different polar substrate with increasing the distance @xmath4 . moreover , the exciton binding energies change hardly when this distance exceeding @xmath4=3.0 nm , which means that the contribution of so phonons to correction are very minor or negligible above this distance and lo phonons dominate the correction of exciton binding energy .",
    "this also provides the highlight for how to evaluate and control the influence of so phonons induced by the substrates on the exciton states in experiments .",
    "in addition , the screening effect of substrate also leads to the large reduction in exciton binding energy has been calculated based on the first - principle@xcite .",
    "although both this screening effect and so phonons are related to the polar substrates and give potential correction to exciton binding energy , the correlations between them can not discuss quantitative in the present study .",
    "the total corrections of exciton - lo and so phonons coupling on exciton binding energies for the monolayer mos@xmath1/sio@xmath1 system are presented in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the magnitude of exciton binding energy can be tuned in a very large scale due to this two kinds of exciton - optical phonons coupling , which not only provides an potential explanation for the divergence of the exciton binding energy between experiment and theory , but also proposes a way to identify the variation of exciton binding energy by controlling the polarization of substrate , the distance @xmath4 and dielectric environment in experiment .",
    "in fact , many - body mechanisms have been assigned to result in these discrepancies in several works@xcite .",
    "the present model proved that exciton - optical phonons coupling is an effective many - body interaction affecting exciton binding energies remarkably as plotted in fig .",
    "4 . especially , the so phonons induced by the polar substrates have potential influence on the properties of excitonic states at certain distance @xmath4 .",
    "these so phonons modes generate a series of novel quantum phenomena in the van der waals heterostructures based on these monolayer tmds materials and arouse more and more interesting in recent years@xcite .    in summary",
