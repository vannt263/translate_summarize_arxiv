    "exactly soluble models are rare in the theory of phase transitions and their prominent importance is hardly disputable . in systems displaying quantum criticality @xcite ,",
    "properties specific to different spatial dimensionalities are entangled , which yields a rich structure of the phase diagram and leads to violations of standard paradigms .",
    "for this reason quantum - critical systems are harder to analyze , and often also more interesting , as compared to their classical counterpart . as a matter of fact , this is hardly ever the case that a microscopic model displaying a quantum critical point can be exactly studied both at temperature @xmath6 and for @xmath7 .",
    "interacting bose systems play a distinct role in the quantum many - body physics and the last two decades brought tremendous progress in their understanding both on the experiment and theory sides .",
    "in particular , a number of important rigorous results concerning the bose - einstain condensation @xcite have been established in the recent years .",
    "these are however in almost all cases restricted to @xmath6 and do not allow access to the unconventional universal features of the phase diagram at @xmath7 and comparison to computations based on non - exact techniques .",
    "a basic aspect of bose - einstein condensation is the actual order of the transition . in the non - interacting case",
    "it is third order ( within the ehrenfest classification ) , on the other hand , order - parameter based studies of dilute bose systems @xcite as well as related effective low - energy bosonic models for underlying fermi systems @xcite typically truncate the effective action at quartic order biasing the system towards a second - order transition .",
    "it is however well known that different fluctuation - related effects tend to change the order of both thermal and quantum phase transitions @xcite , and often destabilize them towards first - order .",
    "in fact , this is hardly ever the case that the transition between the microscopic model and the effective order - parameter description can be made in a fully controlled way .",
    "it is also well known that bose - einstein condensation is sensitive to the boundary conditions and displays different properties at different dimensionalities @xmath0 . for these reasons insights brought by simple interacting microscopic models soluble at @xmath8 and arbitrary dimensionalities",
    "seem very valuable .",
    "in this paper we consider the quantum critical properties of the imperfect bose gas @xcite ( ibg ) in @xmath0 spatial dimensions . for @xmath9 and off the @xmath10 limit this system was rigorously studied @xcite decades ago using sophisticated mathematical methods .",
    "this is however only recently that the analysis was extended to arbitrary @xmath2 @xcite and it was demonstrated that in the classical regime ( in the immediate vicinity of bose - einstein condensation at @xmath7 and for @xmath2 ) this system belongs to the universality class of the @xmath0-dimensional berlin - kac ( spherical ) model @xcite .",
    "this was however so far not appreciated that the system displays a quantum critical point ( qcp ) and is susceptible to exact analysis also off the thermal phase transition , and even for @xmath11 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the imperfect bose gas @xcite reads @xmath12 using the standard notation .",
    "the mean - field interaction energy @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) emerges from a binary repulsive interaction @xmath15 in the kac limit @xmath16 , where the interaction strength is suppressed , but its range diverges @xcite .",
    "this fact clarifies the actual physical content of the model ( [ ibg_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the particles are spinless and are enclosed in a box of volume @xmath17 ; the system is subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we ultimately pass to the thermodynamic limit . applying a hubbard - stratonovich type transformation",

    "the other important observation is that all the scales @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath24 , as well as the correlation length ( see below ) , diverge at the qcp at @xmath6 , @xmath31 .",
    "also note that at arbitrary @xmath32 the limit @xmath10 involves at least two divergent lengthscales @xmath29 and @xmath24 .",

    "( [ s_point_eq ] ) is related to the correlation length @xmath3 via @xcite @xmath41 where the constant @xmath42 depends on the boundary conditions @xcite , and thus @xmath43 implies the divergence of @xmath3 .",

    "bose - einstein condensation persists for @xmath7 in dimensionalities @xmath2 and the thermal transition is in the universality class of the @xmath0-dimensional spherical model .",
    "the system is a rare example of a microscopic model , where one can exactly establish the occurrence of a second - order quantum phase transition and analyze the quantum - critical properties without a recourse to an effective model and ( approximate and not always fully controllable ) renormalization - group methods .",
    "interestingly , the system is solved exactly by a saddle - point approach , but exhibits non - landau critical indices .",
    "instead , for @xmath125 and in the thermal regime , one finds the behavior characteristic to the berlin - kac universality class .",
    "the expression for finite-@xmath1 transition line ( up to a factor defining the interaction constants ) fully coincides with the result obtained from an effective order - parameter field theory at leading order in an expansion in interactions .",
    "this is interesting because the present calculation is valid at arbitrarily large interactions .",
    "for @xmath4 the correlation length shows essentially singular behavior in one of the scaling regimes emergent in the limit @xmath10 . in all the other cases , including @xmath34 we find power - law divergences . for @xmath2",
    "the overall structure of the phase diagram is consistent with the predictions of the renormalization - group theory of effective order - parameter models with the dynamical exponent @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , the vicinity of the quantum critical point splits into the classical regime , dominated by the thermal fluctuations , the quantum - critical regime , and the quantum regime , where the essential system properties are the same as in @xmath6 .",
    "the correlation length in the phase involving the bose - einstein condensate is infinite , indicating generic coherent behavior .",
