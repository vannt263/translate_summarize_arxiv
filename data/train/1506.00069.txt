    "topological insulators ( tis ) became a focus of attention of many condensed matter physicists in recent years , not least due to their possible applications in spintronics and quantum computing .",
    "these are materials with time - reversal symmetry and non - trivial topological order , which have an insulating bulk but conducting topologically protected edge / surface states  @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit interaction plays a significant role in these materials , and particularly manifests itself in spin - momentum locking of charge carriers in edge / surface states .",
    "optical excitation is an efficient tool for generating currents in materials .",
    "this process has been studied in 3d tis  @xcite . in ref .",
    "effects in study are due to electric optical transitions between surface states , which are possible in the presence of magnetic field . besides , in the presence of strong magnetic fields , the electric dipole transitions between landau levels are also possible  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these papers , here we study 2d tis and show that the optical generation of the current is possible without magnetic field as well .",
    "hgte / cdte quantum well structures  @xcite are one of the most well - known 2d tis .",
    "these quantum wells exhibit an inverted band structure if their width exceeds a certain critical value .",
    "the inverted band structure and strong spin - orbit interaction give rise to unusual optoelectronic phenomena , e.g. a nonlinear magneto - gyrotropic photogalvanic effect ( pge )  @xcite ( pge ) .",
    "a circular pge was also experimentally observed  @xcite when the sample was illuminated by mid - infrared or terahertz laser radiation .",
    "these photocurrents were induced due to direct transitions between different size - quantized subbands or due to indirect ( drude - like ) transitions within the lowest size - quantized subband . in both cases",
    "the optical transitions responsible for the pge involve only bulk states .",
    "however , in the case of a finite sample size of 2d ti there exist topologically protected helical edge states which form two branches with opposite spins  @xcite . in the recent paper  @xcite it was predicted that edge states affect bulk magneto - conductivity .",
    "the paper focuses on the bulk properties in a strong magnetic field and does not discuss optoelectronic properties of the edge states . however , it is of interest whether the photocurrent can be induced at the edge states at zero magnetic field .",
    "a pge due to transitions between edge states of the opposite chiralities has been predicted in ref .  , but electric dipole transitions between them are forbidden by selection rules , and only magnetic dipole transitions are possible in this case .",
    "thus , the direct transitions between the edge states are weak . unlike ref .",
    ", in this paper we study electric dipole transitions between the edge and bulk states in hgte / cdte quantum well 2d ti in zero magnetic field , which lead to the edge currents . to our knowledge , this mechanism of the pge in ti has not been studied yet .",
    "starting from the bernevig - hughes - zhang ( bhz ) model of hgte / cdte 2d ti , we find a relation between matrix elements of the edge - bulk transitions . in the general case",
    "the electron - hole symmetry is broken , and the probability of transition depends on the spin and , hence , on the chirality .",
    "thus , the transitions will lead to a different population of spin - up and spin - down states and to occurrence of a photoinduced electric current . in order to study this effect ,",
    "we derive a kinetic equation and then solve it in the quasi - equilibrium approximation",
    ". we also propose a way to detect the photoinduced current by coupling 2d ti with a conductor and measuring an electromotive force ( emf ) induced in the conductor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : transitions ] we consider optical transitions between edge and bulk states and derive the photoinduced electric current .",
    "in section  [ sec : emf ] we calculate the emf that appears in the conductor tunnel - coupled to the edge state .",
    "below we set @xmath0 , @xmath1",
    ".     exceeding the absorption threshold by @xmath2 induces transitions between edge and bulk conduction band states .",
    "the different thickness of arrows depicts that probability of electric dipole transitions may depend on chirality / spin of the edge electron . ]",
    "we consider a hgte / cdte quantum well ti with a conducting helical edge state illuminated by circularly polarized light with a frequency @xmath3 slightly exceeding the the absorption threshold , so that optical transitions may occur between the edge state and the bulk conduction band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transitions ] ) .",
    "we assume that the ti is located at @xmath4 ; @xmath5-axis is taken along the edge of ti , and @xmath6-axis is perpendicular to the 2d ti .    both in hgte and",
    "cdte the relevant bands are s - type band ( @xmath7 ) and p - type band split by spin - orbit interaction into a @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and a @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) bands .",
    "the latter is usually neglected as it has negligible effects on the band structure  @xcite .",
    "cdte has a band - ordering similar to gaas with @xmath7 conduction band and @xmath9 valence band . in hgte",
    "the usual band - ordering is inverted .",
    "the quantum well subbands derived from the heavy - hole @xmath9 are usually denoted by @xmath12 , and the subbands derived from the electron @xmath7 are denoted by @xmath13 .",
    "we describe hgte / cdte quantum well ti by the four - band bhz model  @xcite .    in the four - component basis consisting of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 with @xmath18 correspondingly",
    ", the hamiltonian reads : @xmath19 where @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are material parameters , which depend on quantum well geometry : @xmath25 , @xmath26 ; parameter @xmath24 is negative if the quantum well is in a ti state , and @xmath27 is a value of a band gap in ti .",
    "parameter @xmath28 if electron - hole symmetry is broken , and @xmath29 otherwise .",
    "since the hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : bhz - ham ] ) has been obtained in kp - approximation , and the non - diagonal part of  ( [ eqn : bhz - ham ] ) linear by quasi - momentum @xmath30 corresponds to kp - term , the hamiltonian of a light - matter interaction in electric dipole approximation reads @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the electron charge , @xmath33 is a vector - potential of electromagnetic field . in the case of right - hand polarized light ( as defined from the point of view of the source ) propagating along @xmath6-axis the vector - potential can be represented as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the intensity of light , @xmath36 is the refractive index .    under the illumination by the right - hand",
    "circularly polarized light the selection rules allow only those electric dipole transitions from the edge to bulk , which increase angular momentum by @xmath37 . in the hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : light - matter - ham ] )",
    "these transitions are described by the first term .",
    "the conjugate term describes the reverse optical transitions .    in the absence of the boundary ,",
    "the eigen states of 2d ti are bulk states separated by a gap , and the bulk states at the bottom of the conduction band are formed by @xmath38 states with a zero momentum and a well - defined projection of an angular momentum @xmath39 .    in a finite - size sample , there appear edge states which are superpositions of @xmath40 and @xmath38 bloch wavefunctions .",
    "these edge states can be found by solving schroedinger equation with zero boundary conditions for the hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : bhz - ham ] ) in the coordinate representation in @xmath41-direction and the momentum representation in @xmath5-direction ( see ref .  ):",
    "@xmath42 where @xmath43 are inverse decay lengths for the localized edge states . in the presence of the boundary , conduction band wavefunctions are distorted near the boundary where they overlap with the edge states . instead of explicitly calculating the conduction band wavefunctions by solving schroedinger equation with zero boundary conditions , we will use the time - reversal symmetry and orthogonality conditions for the eigen states of the hamiltonian .",
    "the bhz hamiltonian and zero boundary condition are invariant under the time - reversal symmetry @xmath44 . therefore ,",
    "if the spin - up eigen state with energy @xmath45 is of the form @xmath46 , then the spin - down eigen state can be obtained as @xmath47 we denote the overlap integrals between the edge and bulk states as : @xmath48 mutual orthogonality of edge and bulk states yields the relation between the integrals @xmath49 thus , both @xmath50 and @xmath51 are non - zero , and not only the edge states are superpositions of @xmath52 and @xmath53 bloch wavefunctions with different well - defined projections of total angular momentum , but the bulk conduction states are also their superpositions even at the bottom of the band .",
    "selection rules allow transitions from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , and from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the transitions from the both edge state branches to the conduction band satisfy the selection rules .",
    "calculation of the matrix elements @xmath58 of the first term of the hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : light - matter - ham ] ) corresponding to these transitions yields the main relation @xmath59 note , that if electron - hole symmetry is present , the probabilities of optical transitions from the both edge state branches are equal .",
    "electron - hole symmetry implies that the edge states are superpositions of @xmath60 and @xmath61 with equal ( up to a phase factor ) amplitudes .",
    "the same is true for the bulk states ( it is shown explicitly in the appendix  [ app : electron - hole - symmetry ] ) .",
    "hence , the transition probability for the both spin - up and spin - down branches will be the same .",
    "however , in real samples the electron - hole symmetry is broken i.e. the electron and hole components of the bulk eigen states as well as the edge eigen states are not equal anymore , and the probability of an edge - bulk transition will depend on spin .",
    "values of matrix elements for the case of strong electron - hole asymmetry are derived in  appendix  [ app : asymmetry ] .",
    "we estimate the ratio of probabilities for typical values of parameters@xcite : @xmath62 , @xmath63,@xmath64 , @xmath65 corresponding to the quantum well width @xmath66 . in this case @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the transitions in case of hgte / cdte 2d ti are strongly spin - dependent",
    ".    our consideration can be applicable not only in case of hgte / cdte 2d ti but also in case of other 2d ti which can effectively described by bhz model .",
    "one of the interesting examples is a recently predicted all electron ti in inas double well@xcite which allow easily tune bhz parameters . in case of this material",
    "the band gap @xmath27 is of order of @xmath68 and @xmath69 is order of @xmath70 .",
    "these values of parameters correspond to characteristic frequencies @xmath3 of order of @xmath71 and ratio of matrix elements @xmath72 of order of @xmath73 , i.e. the probabilities of transitions is also strongly spin - dependent .",
    "note , that we used zero boundary conditions ( bcs ) for 2d ti .",
    "the result  ( [ eqn : matrix - elements ] ) does not qualitatively depend on the bcs for the wavefunctions provided they are invariant under time - reversal symmetry and yield helical edge states .",
    "different bcs are discussed in ref .  .",
    "although the choice of the boundary conditions does not affect the topological nature and the existence of the edge states , the spectra of bulk and edge states , and the eigenstates themselves depend on the bcs . particularly , the matrix elements of the transitions may depend on the bcs .",
    "however , in our approach only the eq .",
    "( [ eqn : edge - state ] ) depends on the bcs . in general case the amplitudes of @xmath40 and",
    "@xmath38 bloch functions will be different , but if the electron - hole symmetry is broken these amplitudes will remain still unequal .",
    "further , in order to obtain our main result  ( [ eqn : matrix - elements ] ) we exploit their inequality , time - reversal symmetry and mutual orthogonality of eigenstates .",
    "thus , we believe that the result does not qualitatively depend on the bcs provided they are invariant under time - reversal symmetry and yield helical edge states .",
    "if the light is incident in an arbitrary direction @xmath74 , then the matrix elements @xmath75 can be obtained by replacing vector potential in the light - matter interaction hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : light - matter - ham ] ) with its projection on the ti plane(for details see  appendix  [ app : angle ] ) : @xmath76 below we will use an expression for the value of the squared matrix element averaged over the direction : @xmath77    kinetic equations for distribution functions of electrons in the edge state @xmath78 and in the conduction band @xmath79 can be written as @xmath80}{\\tau_{sp}(\\varepsilon+\\omega,\\varepsilon)}d\\omega     \\label{eqn : kinetic - equation } + \\\\\\frac{n_{-s}(\\varepsilon)-n_s(\\varepsilon)}{\\tau_e}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the rate of transitions induced by illumination , @xmath82 is the rate of spontaneous transitions between the conduction bulk state with energy @xmath83 and the edge state with energy @xmath84 , i.e. recombination rate ; @xmath85 is the spin relaxation time for the edge electrons . since there is still discussion in the literature@xcite which mechanism agrees better with experimental data , in this paper we introduce this time assuming that in any realistic system it is finite .",
    "here we write these kinetic equations  ( [ eqn : kinetic - equation ] ) phenomenologically , and more rigorous derivation based on the keldysh technique is given in the appendix  [ sec : ke - appendix ] .",
    "the rate of the transitions induced by illumination can be related to the matrix elements using the fermi golden rule @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the density of states in the conduction band with a fixed @xmath88 : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the effective mass of conduction band electrons and @xmath91 is the length of 2d ti in the @xmath41 direction .",
    "note that summation over @xmath92 in the definition of @xmath93 instead of summation over both @xmath92 and @xmath88 reflect the fact , that the transitions are vertical , i.e. @xmath88 projection of momentum conserves .    in order to deduce a relation between induced and spontaneous transition rates one can use a detailed balancing condition similar to that for einstein coefficients for discrete levels@xcite .",
    "the factors @xmath94 in the kinetic equation do not depend on the illumination and environment , since they are intrinsic properties of the 2d ti .",
    "therefore , the kinetic equation  ( [ eqn : kinetic - equation ] ) should remain valid if we put the system in thermal equilibrium with black body radiation . in this case",
