    "in general , the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) refers to any change of the temperature of the magnetic material under the variation of external magnetic field . the revival of interest toward the various aspects of the physics of mce which has been observed recently is mainly connected with the potential room - temperature cooling applications ( see refs .   for recent reviews ) .",
    "another important application of the mce is the possibility to map out the @xmath3-@xmath4 phase diagram by detecting the magnetocaloric anomalies at a magnetic phase transition at high ( pulsed ) fields .",
    "for some materials there is no alternative way to do that . since the first successful experiment of adiabatic demagnetization@xcite , mce is the standard technique of achieving the extremely low temperatures@xcite",
    ".    another important issue of the mce is its intimate relation with the quantum critical points ( qcps)@xcite . the mce can be quantified by the adiabatic cooling rate @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the heat capacity at the constant magnetic field , and @xmath7 is the magnetization .",
    "the dependence of the cooling rate on the magnetic field is an important characteristic of a specific magnetic material .",
    "the cooling rate @xmath8 is related to the so - called generalized grneisen ratio , @xmath9 the important quantity characterizing the qcp .",
    "it is known that the generalized grneisen ratio changes its sign when the parameter @xmath10 governing the zero - temperature quantum phase transitions crosses its critical value @xmath11 , i.e. , in the qcp@xcite . in the case of mce @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ 1.02 ] ) is the external magnetic field @xmath3 and qcp corresponds to the critical value @xmath12 at which the system undergoes the transition between different magnetic structures at zero temperature@xcite . as the sign of the cooling rate depends on the way magnetic field affects the entropy at isothermal conditions , the system can undergo adiabatic cooling as well as adiabatic heating under the increasing ( or under the decreasing ) of the external magnetic field magnitude .",
    "thus , the magnetic materials with complicated structure of zero - temperature ( ground - state ) phase diagram display non - trivial mce with a sequence of cooling and heating .    very recently",
    ", exact as well as numerical descriptions of the mce in various one - dimensional interacting spin systems have been attracted much attention@xcite .",
    "some two - dimensional systems have been also investigated , mainly , in the context of effect of frustration on the mce@xcite .",
    "the main features of mce which have been revealed during the investigation of various models are : ( i ) essential enhancement of mce in the vicinity of qcp , ( ii ) enhancement of mce by frustration , ( iii ) appearance of the sequence of cooling and heating stages during adiabatic ( de)magnetization for the systems demonstrating several magnetically ordered ground states , and ( iv ) potential application of mce data for the investigation of critical properties of the system at hand .",
    "in this paper we continue the investigation of the mce in one - dimensional quantum spin systems admitting the exact solution in the form of free spinless fermions via the jordan - wigner transformation ( see , for instance , ref .  ) .",
    "though , the cases of spin-1/2 @xmath0 ( isotropic ) and @xmath13 ( anisotropic ) models have been considered in ref .  , there is a series of spin chains with multiple spin interactions introduced by suzuki in 70s@xcite which can be solved by the standard jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "we consider the simplest model of the suzuki series , the spin-1/2 @xmath0 chain with three - spin interactions both of @xmath1 and @xmath2 type@xcite .",
    "as has been shown in previous investigations , inclusion of the three - spin interactions leads to appearance of new phases in the ground state and , thus , to more reach behavior in the vicinity of quantum phase transitions .",
    "we study two different types of three - spin interactions , namely , the three - spin interaction of the @xmath1 type@xcite and of the @xmath2 type@xcite .",
    "although these types of three - spin interactions are connected to each other by a unitary transformation@xcite , in the pure form they represent the systems with different symmetries and have different ground - state phase diagrams . in particular , in the former case the ground - state phase diagram contains a point , where three different ground states merge [ quantum triple point ( qtp ) ] .",
    "appearance of additional parameters in the system , the three - spin coupling constants in our case , makes possible manipulation of the physical features of mce , namely , the position of the qcp and the values of the maximal and minimal temperatures during the adiabatic ( de)magnetization .",
    "the knowledge about manipulation of the mce physical parameters can be very useful for the future quest for the novel magnetic materials and their applications in various aspects .",
    "on the other hand , the appearance of the points where several magnetically ordered ground states merge on the ground - state phase diagram , caused by the inclusion of additional three - spin interactions into the hamiltonian , can lead to essential enhancement of mce due to large entropy accumulation in such points . finally , in real - life materials randomness is always present .",
    "it can be modeled assuming that on - site fields or intersite interactions acquire random values .",
    "the considered quantum spin chains admit an exact analytical solution for thermodynamics in the case when the transverse magnetic field is a random variable with the lorentzian probability distribution@xcite . as a result , with such a model",
    "it is possible to discuss the mce in the presence of randomness .",
