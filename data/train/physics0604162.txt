    "liquid crystals ( lcs ) play an important role in the modern technologies being used for numerous applications in electronic imaging , display manufacturing , and optoelectronics  @xcite .",
    "a large variety of electro - optical effects that may occur in lcs can be employed for a design of photonic devices .",
    "for example , the property of lcs to change its orientational structure and the refractive index in the presence of a static electric field suggests one of the most attractive and practical schemes for tuning the photonic bandgap devices  @xcite .",
    "nonlinear optical properties of lcs and multistability of light transmission are of a great interest for the future applications of lcs in photonics  @xcite .",
    "light polarized perpendicular to the lc director changes its orientation provided the light intensity exceeds some threshold value  @xcite .",
    "this effect is widely known as _ the light - induced freedericksz transition _ ( lift ) , and its theory was developed more than two decades ago in a number of the pioneering papers  @xcite .",
    "in particular , zeldovich _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the light - induced freedericksz transition can generally be treated as the second - order orientational transition , but in some types of lcs hysteresis - like dependencies and two thresholds can be observed , for the increasing and decreasing intensity of the input light .",
    "the results obtained later by ong  @xcite confirmed that for the mbba nematics the freedericksz transition is of the second order and there is no hysteresis behavior , whereas for the paa nematics the freedericksz transition is of the first order and the hysteresis - like behavior with two distinct thresholds should be observed .",
    "although these conclusions have been confirmed to some extent in later experiments  @xcite , the theory developed earlier was based on the geometrical optics and by its nature is approximate .",
    "the similar approximation was used later  @xcite for taking into account a backward wave in a lc film placed in a fabry - perot resonator , where it was shown that the threshold of the freedericksz transition depends periodically on the lc cell thickness .",
    "nonlinear optical properties of a nematic lc film in a fabry - perot interferometer was studied by khoo _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who considered the propagation of light polarized under an acute angle to the lc director and observed experimentally bistability in the output light intensity caused by giant nonlinearity of the lc film .",
    "cheung  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite observed experimentally the effects of multistability in a similar system , including oscillations of the output light intensity .",
    "however , in spite of numerous theoretical studies and experimental observations , a self - consistent theory of the light - induced freedericksz transition based on a systematic analysis of the coupled equations for the nematic director and electromagnetic field is still missing .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we consider a general problem of the light transmission through a homeotropically - oriented nematic lc and analyze the specific conditions for the multistability and light - induced freedericksz transition , for possible applications in all - optical switching photonic devices .",
    "second , for the first time to our knowledge , we consider this problem self - consistently and solve numerically a coupled system of the stationary equations for the director and maxwell s equations .",
    "we present our results for two kinds of nematic liquid crystal , para - azoxyanisole ( paa ) and np - methoxybenzylidene - np - butylaniline ( mbba ) , which show quite dissimilar behavior of the nematic director at the freedericksz transition in the previous theoretical studies @xcite , and also discuss light transmission and bistability thresholds as functions of the cell thickness .    the paper is organized as follows . sections  ii and iii present our basic equations and outline our numerical approach .",
    "section  iv summarizes our results for two kinds of nematic liquid crystal and discusses in detail both bistability and hysteresis - type behavior of the light transmission .",
    "section  v concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a nematic lc cell confined between two planes ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) with the director initially oriented along the @xmath2 axis ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the lc cell interacts with a normally incident monochromatic electromagnetic wave described by the electric field @xmath3 , @xmath4.\\ ] ]     ( colour online ) schematic representation of the problem .",
    "a lc cell is placed between two walls ( @xmath5 ) , the vector @xmath6 describes the molecules orientation in the cell . ,",
    "width=188 ]    to derive the basic equations , we write the free energy of the lc cell in the presence of the electromagnetic wave as follows  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 ^ 2,\\ ] ] @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the lc elastic energy density , @xmath11 is a contribution to the free energy density from the light field , @xmath6 is the nematic director , @xmath12 are the elastic constants , @xmath13 is the lc dielectric permittivity tensor , @xmath14 describes anisotropy of the lc dielectric susceptibility , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the main components of the tensor @xmath17 parallel and perpendicular to the director , respectively .",
    "we assume that outside the lc cell the electric field is directed along the @xmath18 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which can cause the director reorientation in the @xmath19 plane inside the lc cell .",
    "when the incident beam is broad , we can describe it as a plane wave , so that all functions inside the lc cell will depend only on the @xmath2-coordinate .",
    "therefore , we can seek the spatial distribution of the nematic director in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the angle between the director and the @xmath2 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the unit vectors in the cartesian coordinate frame .    after minimizing the free energy ( [ eq2 ] ) with respect to the director angle @xmath21 , we obtain the stationary equation for the lc director orientation in the presence of the light field    @xmath24    where we take into account that , as follows from maxwell s equations , the electric vector of the light field inside the lc cell has the longitudinal component @xmath25 .    from maxwell s equations ,",
    "we obtain the scalar equation for the @xmath18-component of the electric field , @xmath26 where @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the wavelength of the incident light .",
    "the time - averaged @xmath2-component of the poynting vector , @xmath29 , remains unchanged inside the lc cell  @xcite , and it can be used for characterizing different regimes of the nonlinear transmission .",
    "we solve the system of coupled nonlinear equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) in a self - consistent manner together with the proper boundary conditions . for the director , we assume the strong anchoring at the cell boundaries , i.e. @xmath30 whereas for the electric field we consider the standard scattering conditions @xmath31 here @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the amplitudes of the incident , reflected , and outgoing waves , respectively . in all equations",
    "above we consider the magnetic susceptibility @xmath35 , and the refractive index outside the cell @xmath36 , also taking into account that @xmath37 .",
    "the boundary conditions ( [ eq7 ] ) imply that we consider two counter - propagating waves on the left side of the lc cell , incoming and reflecting , whereas only an outgoing wave appears on the right side .",
    "therefore , in order to solve this nonlinear problem , first we fix the amplitude of the outgoing wave @xmath34 .",
    "it allows us to find the unique values of the incident @xmath32 and reflected @xmath33 waves .",
    "equation for the director ( [ eq4 ] ) is similar to a general - type equation for a nonlinear pendulum with the fixed boundary conditions ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "this means that we should look for its periodic solutions with the period @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , there exist many periodic solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "first of all , a trivial solution @xmath39 corresponds to the undisturbed orientation distribution of the director and the absolute minimum of the free energy ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the freedericksz transition occurs when this trivial solution becomes unstable for larger values of the input light intensity , and the director angle @xmath40 becomes nonzero .",
    "we find this solution numerically by using the well - known _ shooting method _  @xcite . by fixing the amplitude of the outgoing wave @xmath34 and taking @xmath41 at the right boundary",
    ", we find the values of the derivative @xmath42 such that after integration we obtain a vanishing value of the director angle at the left boundary , @xmath43 . by analyzing the nonlinear equation ( [ eq4 ] ) in a two - dimensional phase space",
    ", we can show that the corresponding solution lies just below the separatrix curve , and it has no node between the points @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this observation allows us to reduce significantly the parameter region for the required values of the derivative @xmath42 . from the obtained set of solutions we chose the solution that corresponds to the absolute minimum of the free energy ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "( colour online ) ( a , b ) spatial distributions of the field amplitude @xmath44 in the cell of mbba , _ before _ ( dashed ) and _ after _ ( solid ) the light - induced freedericksz transition , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "( b ) spatial distributions of the director deviation angle @xmath40 in the cell of mbba _ after _ the light - induced freedericksz transition , for @xmath48 ( solid ) , @xmath49 ( dashed ) , are shown together with the function @xmath50 at @xmath51 ( dash - dotted ) .",
    ", width=302 ]    we also take into account the fact that a finite energy barrier can appear between the minima of the free energy which correspond to the trivial and nontrivial solutions for the director orientation angle @xmath40 . when the light intensity decreases adiabatically , the director does not return to its initial undisturbed position at the threshold value of the `` up '' freedericksz transition , but it remains in a disturbed state which corresponds to a local minimum of the free energy ; thus , the transition to the state @xmath39 takes place only when this energy barrier disappears .",
    "this leads to a hysteresis - like dependence of the director and the different threshold values for the `` up '' and `` down '' transitions in the director orientation .",
    "we solve the nonlinear transmission problem for two kinds of nematic liquid crystals , para - azoxyanisole ( paa ) and np - methoxybenzylidene - np - butylaniline ( mbba ) , which possess different signs of the parameter @xmath52 , which appears in the geometrical optics approximation  @xcite . according to their approach ,",
    "the sign of this parameter @xmath53 determines the order of the freedericksz transition . for paa @xmath54 and",
    "the freedericksz transition should be of the first order , while for mbba @xmath55 and there should be the second order transition .",
    "we take the following physical parameters  @xcite : ( a ) for paa , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , at @xmath60 , and ( b ) for mbba , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , at @xmath46 ; and consider two values for the cell thickness , @xmath45 and @xmath49 .",
    "spatial distributions of the electric field amplitude @xmath65 in the lc cell before and after the light - induced freedericksz transition occurs is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) for the parameters of mbba and the cell thickness @xmath45 . for the other value of the lc cell thickness ( @xmath49 ) , the spatial distribution of the electric field is similar , but the number of the oscillations of the electric field @xmath44 inside the lc cell increases due to a larger value of @xmath66 . for paa , a very similar distribution of the electric field is found .",
    "thus , we reveal an essentially inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the electric field inside the lc cell , and the functions @xmath65 are different before and after the freedericksz transition .    spatial distribution of the director orientation angle @xmath40 inside the lc cell after the freedericksz transition",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) for the parameters of mbba , for @xmath67 and @xmath49 , respectively . on the same plot ,",
    "we show the function @xmath68 at @xmath69 for comparison .",
    "we notice that the position of the maximum of the director deviation angle can shift from the point @xmath70 , as a consequence of an asymmetric distribution of the field @xmath65 inside the lc cell .",
    "spatial distribution of the director angle @xmath40 in the paa cell has the same character as that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) for mbba .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we present our numerical results for a change of the maximum deformation angle @xmath71 of the director as a function of the power density inside lc @xmath72 for increasing and decreasing light intensity , for both paa and mbba and two values of the cell thickness , @xmath73 and @xmath49 . for both kinds of lc , we observe a hysteresis - like dependence of the angle @xmath74 and two different thresholds of the light - induced director reorientation : @xmath75 , for the increasing intensity , and @xmath76 , for the decreasing intensity . in both cases ,",
    "these two thresholds correspond to the first - order transition .",
    "the results are similar for two values of the lc cell thickness , see figs .",
    "[ fig3](a - d ) .",
    "thus , our results suggest that at the light - induced freedericksz transition the cells of both kinds of lcs , paa and mbba , reveal hysteresis - like behavior with the respect to @xmath72 .",
    "dependencies of the amplitude of the outgoing wave @xmath77 on the amplitude of the incident wave @xmath78 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a - d ) for the parameters of both paa and mbba .",
    "depending on the lc cell thickness @xmath79 , the cell transmission is characterized by either hysteresis or multistability with respect to the incident wave amplitude . in the case of small thickness of the lc cell ( @xmath73 )",
    "only the hysteresis - like transmission is observed ; it is caused by the hysteresis behavior of the director reorientation between `` up '' and `` down '' thresholds , as presented in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a , c ) .",
    "however , for larger thickness ( @xmath80 ) we observe the transmission multistability , above the `` up '' threshold for increasing light intensity , and above the `` down '' threshold for decreasing light intensity [ see figs .",
    "[ fig4](b , d ) ] .",
    "multistability in our system is similar to that of a nonlinear resonator , and is it determined by the resonator properties of a finite thickness of the lc cell .",
    "( colour online ) thresholds of the director reorientation for increasing ( solid ) and decreasing ( dotted ) light intensities vs. the cell thickness @xmath79 : ( a ) paa , ( b ) mbba .",
    ", width=302 ]    the thresholds of the director reorientation for increasing and decreasing light intensities are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5](a , b ) , for paa and mbba , respectively , as functions of the normalized thickness of the lc cell .",
    "similar to the results of the geometrical optics approximation  @xcite , the threshold values are proportional to @xmath81 , but they increase approximately in two times due to an essentially inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the electric field inside the lc cell .",
    "a similar increase of the threshold value for an inhomogeneous distribution of the electric field in the lc cell was also mentioned by lednei _",
    "et al . _",
    "in addition , for the `` up '' threshold we observe an additional periodic dependence of the threshold value on the cell thickness @xmath79 , which is typical for resonators and is caused by an interference of two counter - propagating waves in the lc cell .",
    "this result agrees with the results obtained for lc in a fabry - perot resonator  @xcite .",
    "the `` up '' threshold is determined by a competition between the electric field forces and elastic forces of the liquid crystal , and thus the interference distribution of the electric field in the lc cell is important .",
    "however , the `` down '' threshold is defined by the condition of the disappearance of a barrier between the local and absolute minima of the lc free energy  @xcite .",
    "we suppose that difference of these mechanisms leads to the different type of @xmath79-dependencies for the `` up '' and `` down '' thresholds .",
    "we should mention that our results differ qualitatively from the results of earlier studies  @xcite , where for mbba both hysteresis and bistability were not predicted . in the simplest case of one traveling wave  @xcite",
    ", the conservation of the value of @xmath72 during the freedericksz transition leads to the conservation of the electromagnetic field amplitudes at the boundaries of the lc cell .",
    "however , in the general case there always exists a reflected wave , so that we have @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , @xmath84 are the power densities of the incident and reflected waves , respectively .",
    "in such a case , the conservation of @xmath85 does not require the conservation of @xmath83 and @xmath86 , so that the amplitudes of the electromagnetic fields at @xmath0 can change at the freedericksz transition , as is seen in fig .",
    "thus , the problem solved in this paper and that in refs .",
    "@xcite corresponds to different boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , we suggest that experimentally observed the second order freedericksz transition for mbba liquid crystal @xcite is caused by the weak reflection from the boundaries of lc cell . in that situation , the single wave approximation can be used and results obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite become valid .",
    "we have analyzed the light transmission through homeotropically - oriented cell of a nematic liquid crystal , and studied multistability and light - induced freedericksz transition .",
    "we have solved numerically the coupled stationary equations for the nematic director and electric field of the propagating electromagnetic wave , for two kinds of liquid crystals ( paa and mbba ) .",
    "we have found that the liquid crystals of both kinds possess multistability and hysteresis behavior in the transmission characterized by two thresholds of the director reorientation , so that for the increasing and decreasing light intensities the freedericksz transition is of the first order .",
    "we have demonstrated that the resonator effects of the liquid - crystal cell associated with the light reflection from two boundaries are significant , and they are responsible , in particular , for the observed periodic dependence of the threshold values and multistability of the transmitted light as a function of the cell thickness .",
    "we expect that these features will become important for the study of periodic photonic structures with holes filled in liquid crystals @xcite where multiple reflection effects and nonlinear light - induced freedericksz transition should be taken into account for developing tunable all - optical switching devices based on the structure with liquid crystals .",
