    "an accurate description of electronic excited states has always been a major goal for theoretical and computational chemists .",
    "nowadays , linear - response time - dependent density functional theory ( lr - tddft ) @xcite has become the standard workhorse for practical applications , because of the favorable balance between accuracy and computational cost . however , there are a variety of well - established limitations of tddft with the standard semilocal functionals @xcite .",
    "these challenges include double excitations , charge transfer ( ct ) excitations , and rydberg excitations@xcite .",
    "although many of these problems can be ameliorated by using range - separated @xcite or more accurate asymptotic - corrected response kernels @xcite , the results are not always satisfactory , and a more careful examination beyond the usual tabulations of mean absolute errors is required to check for an accurate rydberg series .    quantum defect ( qd ) theory@xcite has long been applied as a test for atomic rydberg excitations@xcite . in the long history of quantum mechanics , the qd was originally introduced to empirically describe weak electron penetration effects relative to strong shielding effect @xcite . later , systematic derivations were given , creating a non - empirical theory @xcite .",
    "the qd can also be applied to describe many molecular rydberg states @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to atomic rydberg series .",
    "qds are often given as lists , with the index corresponding to the principal quantum number .",
    "but the crucial feature of qds is that they are smoothly varying functions of the energy .",
    "in fact , they even merge continuously with scattering phase shifts across the ionization threshold@xcite .",
    "we use the smoothness feature to create our procedure for extracting qds from lists of excitation energies . in earlier work ,",
    "van faassen and burke @xcite analyzed the singlet and triplet spin - states of the s- and p- series for atomic helium , beryllium and neon as test cases for standard tddft .",
    "although excitation energy errors were no more than a few millihartree , the delicate qd results exposed their limitations . with a ground - state dft calculation that yields a potential with the correct asymptotic decay (",
    "although see ref .",
    "@xcite for a way around even this restriction ) , qds that were reasonably but not highly accurate were usually found with semilocal approximations to the kernel in tddft .",
    "later , the d series in be was shown to be very poorly described by tddft@xcite .",
    "recently , two of us developed the particle - particle random phase approximation ( pp - rpa ) and the particle - particle tamm - dancoff approximation ( pp - tda ) theory for calculation of challenging excitations such as double excitations , charge transfer excitations , rydberg excitations , and excitations in diradicals .",
    "good excitation energies were typically found with a relatively low @xmath0 computational cost , where @xmath1 is the number of virtual orbitals.@xcite thus pp - rpa and pp - tda are promising methods that complement standard lr - tddft , especially for these challenging cases . in the present work ,",
    "we develop qd analysis to more stringently test these methods , and compare them to tddft .",
    ".[beexci ] first 11 excitation energies in be @xmath2p series . for transitions to @xmath3 and higher ,",
    "the values have been extracted from the fits to the associated qds given later ( for alda , this begins at @xmath4 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the fact that pp - rpa and pp - tda are able to describe charge transfer and rydberg excitations is often attributed to their coulomb and exchange kernels which are asymptotically correct . however",
    ", the orbital energies from the two - electron deficient reference also play a vital role .",
    "although the coulomb and exchange kernel is the same , the pp - rpa and pp - tda with dft references substantially underestimate the rydberg excitation energies @xcite as a result of the poor kohn - sham orbital energies , making it meaningless to further look into the qd , just as in the tddft case . because pp - rpa is only a first - order approximation to the adiabatic connection - pairing matrix fluctuation theory",
    ", it remains sensitive to the properties of the reference calculation .",
    "a well - behaved reference , such as hf in this atomic rydberg excitation case , is needed for pp - rpa and pp - tda to produce meaningful qds . however , for low - energy excitations in molecules , dft references lead to significantly better results.@xcite",
    "in this paper , we have developed a very general approach for extracting both threshold energies and qds from limited series of rydberg excitations .",
    "we have demonstrated that our procedure can be used to extract extremely accurate threshold energies ( errors in the 0.1 mh range ) , and maximum errors of order 0.01 for qds .",
    "we have shown why measures like mean unsigned errors in collections of transition frequencies are not useful for rydberg series , and how to parametrize and quantify errors in qd s .",
    "we find that pp - rpa with a hf reference greatly outperforms tddft with a local approximation to the exchange - correlation kernel .",
    "the results reported here should become the benchmark for approximate calculations of rydberg series .",
    "our qd extraction procedure can be applied to other series , such as excitions in solids .",
    "any quantum chemical method for excitations should be measured against our pp - rpa results for these atoms .",
    "we suspect they will be difficult be beat with the same level of generality and low computational cost .",
