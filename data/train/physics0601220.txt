    "for many interesting problems in plasma physics a deeper understanding can only be gained with the help of kinetic plasma models .",
    "in contrast to macroscopic models where only the streaming velocity , pressure , temperature and other fluid quantities are considered , the kinetic description deals with the particle distribution function @xmath0 . here @xmath1 is the position in space and @xmath2 is the three dimensional velocity .",
    "the equation describing the evolution of the six dimensional distribution function in phase space for a collisionless system is the vlasov equation .",
    "the complexity of kinetic plasma descriptions arises because of the electromagnetic fields appearing in the vlasov equation .",
    "these depend on the charge density and current density in the plasma which are in turn given by the moments of the distribution function .",
    "thus the system presents itself as a strongly coupled non  linear system of partial differential equations .",
    "analytical solutions of this system are only possible for a very restricted number of special problems .    among the numerous problems ,",
    "where collisionless kinetic plasma simulations are important , we name only two topics , which are important in both laboratory- and astrophysical settings .",
    "these are the thin current sheet region in collisionless magnetic reconnection processes and the structure of collisionless shocks .",
    "the harris sheet model @xcite gives a kinetic equilibrium of a current sheet separating two regions of different magnetic field . while this can be formulated analytically , the reconnection process , which is initiated by small perturbations from the harris equilibrium , is not yet fully understood .",
    "also , there has been tremendous progress in the last 10 years , both on the fluid level ( see @xcite ) and using kinetic simulations ( see @xcite for particle in cell simulations and @xcite for vlasov simulations ) .",
    "still many questions remain to be solved , such as : the spontaneous onset of reconnection , three dimensional effects , turbulence in the reconnection zone , acceleration of particles , and comparison to experiments .",
    "it has become clear that , especially for the acceleration of particles , fully kinetic models and simulations are inevitable . up to now",
    "most kinetic simulations make use of the particle in cell method ( pic ) , and very few deal with a direct integration of the vlasov equation . in order to validate pic simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection ,",
    "it is necessary to simulate the same problems using different schemes , and vlasov schemes are an important alternative method .",
    "the second important system currently investigated is the problem of collisionless shocks . in the framework of mhd  equations these shocks appear as singular points , where the macroscopic quantities show a discontinuity . to understand the inner structure of shocks , kinetic models are necessary since only they can describe the underlying dissipation processes .",
    "for some special geometries together with low mach numbers there are time independent analytical solutions to the kinetic equations , corresponding to stable shock conditions . for higher mach numbers these solutions break down , and a time dependant behaviour appears .",
    "this leads to excitation of wave modes with a possibility of particle acceleration .",
    "this time dependant behaviour is not accessible with analytical methods , and numerical approaches have to be attempted .    as mentioned above , in practise",
    "there are two different numerical approaches to solving the vlasov equation . in the particle in cell ( pic ) approach trajectories of individual representative particles",
    "are followed through the electromagnetic fields .",
    "the fields are given on a numerical grid , while the positions and velocities of the simulation particles can be any value .",
    "due to the finite number of particles , the pic method suffers from considerable numerical noise .",
    "a related problem is the fact that only those parts of the distribution function can be calculated with high precision which contain many particles in a phase space volume .",
    "in particular the high energy tails of the distribution function can not be resolved .",
    "the other numerical approach integrates the vlasov equation directly on a high dimensional numerical grid in phase space .",
    "these vlasov schemes do not suffer from any numerical noise .",
    "the tails of the distribution function can be modelled with high accuracy , and deviations from a maxwellian distribution can be pinpointed .",
    "these advantages are traded against higher computational effort of the vlasov  codes as compared to pic",
    " codes . additionally , care has to be taken for choosing the integration scheme of vlasov s equation , taking into account the hyperbolic nature and corresponding integral quantities .",
    "the distribution function has to fulfil a number of restrictions which are derived from its physical interpretation as probability density in phase space and from the properties of the vlasov equation .",
    "the probability density interpretation implies that the distribution function has to remain positive at all times .",
    "one property of vlasov s equation is that the values of the distribution function are transported along the characteristics through phase space without modification .",
    "when starting from a positive distribution function this not only implies that the positivity is preserved but also that both upper and lower bounds of the distribution function remain unchanged , and that no new maxima or minima are generated .",
    "a second property of vlasov s equation is the conservation of phase space density as a consequence of liouville s equation .",
    "a numerical scheme can not satisfy all the above criteria exactly .",
    "therefore a number of numerical schemes have been proposed , each of which is a compromise between different requirements .",
    "spectral codes which solve the vlasov equation in the fourier domain suffer only from little numerical diffusion , but they are mostly limited to periodic boundary conditions , see e.g.  @xcite . another important drawback of these methods is that they do not preserve positivity , let alone the number of extrema in the distribution function .",
    "eulerian solvers , on the other hand , allow for non  periodic boundary conditions and can be made to preserve positivity and the maximum principle .",
    "they are , however , slightly more diffusive than spectral codes",
    ". a recent comparison of eulerian solvers can be found in @xcite . in this work",
    "we will use a flux conservative and positive scheme @xcite which obeys the maximum principle and suffers from relatively little numerical diffusion .",
    "the integration of the vlasov equation has to be performed simultaneously to the evaluation of the maxwell equations .",
    "the dynamics of the full electrodynamic fields imposes an additional criterion for the time step used in the simulation .",
    "since electromagnetic waves can travel through the system , the time step has to be chosen such that the speed of light @xmath3 is resolved on the numerical grid : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the time step and @xmath6 is the grid resolution .",
    "one way to avoid this is to use an electrostatic model .",
    "this is , however , only applicable in special situations where the self generated magnetic field can be neglected . here",
    "we will use the darwin approximation of maxwell s equations , which follows from a rigorous expansion of the full maxwell equations in orders of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a characteristic velocity of the system . in the framework of the darwin approximation ,",
    "the purely electromagnetic modes are neglected but electrostatic , magnetostatic , and inductive fields are still considered .",
    "darwin s approximation has been widely used with particle in cell simulations @xcite , however , it has not found its way into vlasov simulations yet .",
    "an alternative method is the use of an implicit time stepping as it has been implemented by @xcite in the celested3d code .",
    "the next section will present the basic equations together with their normalisation . in section [ secdarwin ] we will introduce the darwin approximation of the maxwell equations .",
    "section [ secfluxcons ] will give an overview of the one dimensional flux conservative scheme used for integrating vlasov s equation , while section [ seccharacter ] will describe the time splitting schemes that provides the generalisation to the 5dimensional phase space .",
    "in section [ secresults ] results are presented , and section [ secconclusion ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "in this and the next section we want to present the basic equations and approximations of our model .",
    "the aim is to simulate vlasov s equation @xmath9    here @xmath10 is the distribution function of species @xmath11 . in this work only singly charged ions and electrons @xmath12 are considered , although the code allows arbitrary species .",
    "the quantities @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the charge and the mass of the particles of species @xmath11 .",
    "the lorentz force depends on the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "these are in general given by maxwell s equations , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the magnetic and @xmath17 the electric field . in section [ secdarwin ]",
    "we will present the darwin approximation of maxwell s equations , which is used to solve the electromagnetic fields in our simulation code .",
    "the charge density @xmath18 and the current density @xmath19 are given by the moments of the distribution function , @xmath20      here we want to present the normalisation of the vlasov ",
    "maxwell system equations . for this",
    "we introduce normalising parameters @xmath21 , where @xmath22 stands for any of the physical quantities .",
    "the normalised quantities @xmath23 are then given by @xmath24 .",
    "the un  normalised characteristics of vlasov s equation for species @xmath11 are given by @xmath25 here we have used the symbols @xmath1 and @xmath2 to denote the characteristics @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these have to be distinguished from the independent variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 in vlasov s equation . in the following",
    "the appropriate meaning should be clear from the context .",
    "the form of the above equations is not modified by the normalisation , @xmath28    only the individual charge to mass ratios @xmath29 are relevant parameters of the system . on the other hand",
    ", maxwell s equations simplify to @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the ratio of the normalisation velocity over the speed of light .",
    "we choose @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the ion mass and @xmath35 is the unit electron charge . @xmath36 and @xmath37 remain free to choose .",
    "then @xmath38 is the ion inertial length , @xmath39 is the inverse ion gyro frequency ( @xmath40 ) , and @xmath41 is the alfvn velocity .",
    "we still have the freedom of choosing the magnetic field @xmath36 .",
    "if we choose @xmath36 to be a characteristic magnetic field magnitude in the system , then @xmath42 gives the ratio of alfvn velocity to the speed of light in the system . on the other hand we can choose @xmath36 such that @xmath43 .",
    "then the local magnetic field magnitude in the system determines @xmath44 . in this work",
    "we will choose the first , so that the field magnitude in the system remains around unity and the free parameter @xmath42 can be used to set the magnetic field strength . in the following",
    "we will drop the hat  notation ( @xmath45 ) for the normalised quantities .",
    "the flux conservative integration scheme of the vlasov equation , which will be presented in section [ secfluxcons ] , is not restricted by a cfl condition on the time step . however , when combined with the maxwell equations for the electromagnetic fields a cfl condition is introduced by the time integration of the fields on the numerical grid .",
    "this implies that the fastest electromagnetic wave mode , i.e. the vacuum mode , has to be resolved on the grid , @xmath46 where @xmath3 is the speed of light .",
    "this condition imposes severe restrictions on the time step . in many applications the electromagnetic vacuum modes are not important .",
    "the standard solution to this problem is the electrostatic approximation . in this approximation",
    "only poisson s equation needs to be solved for the electric field .",
    "a magnetic vacuum field can also be superimposed .",
    "the influence of the plasma on the magnetic field is , however , completely neglected . to account for this influence , and thus the possibility of magnetosonic wave modes ,",
    "the darwin approximation is commonly used in particle simulations .",
    "this approximation can be derived from the maxwell equations in an expansion in orders of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is some characteristic velocity . assuming @xmath47 this leads to a set of equations where the vacuum modes are eliminated but all other wave modes are retained .",
    "darwin s approximation can be used when the velocities are small compared to the speed of light and there is no energy transported by the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "some applications are the study of magnetic reconnection , e.g. in the earths magnetotail @xcite , or the investigation of high intensity charged particle beams @xcite .",
    "naturally it is not capable of describing phenomena where the electromagnetic vacuum modes play a major role , e.g. in laser  plasma interaction .",
    "darwin s approximation starts from a separation of the electric field into a longitudinal and a transverse part @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath49    the normalised maxwell s equations are then approximated by @xmath50 the approximation only appears in eq ( [ erregb ] ) , where only the longitudinal part of the displacement current is taken .",
    "all other equations remain unchanged . in vacuum ,",
    "equations ( [ errege ] ) and ( [ erregb ] ) are now decoupled and no purely electromagnetic modes can appear .    an advantage of using darwin s approximation instead of the full maxwell equations is the fact , that the equations can be solved without performing a time integration step .",
    "all the electromagnetic fields can be calculated from the moments of the distribution at a given time together with the boundary conditions for the fields .",
    "this will be presented in the following .",
    "poisson s equation for the electrostatic potential @xmath51 immediately gives the longitudinal electric field .",
    "taking the curl of ( [ erregb ] ) , together with ( [ esplit ] ) and ( [ divbzero ] , results in @xmath52 giving three poisson equations for the components of the magnetic field . to calculate @xmath53 the curl of eq ( [ errege ] )",
    "is taken and eqs ( [ erregb ] ) and ( [ esplit ] ) substituted , giving @xmath54 to eliminate the time derivative of the current density , @xmath19 is expressed as moment of the distribution function , @xmath55 here the index @xmath11 sums over all particle species .",
    "now , vlasov s equations for the different species are substituted , @xmath56 here the pointed brackets @xmath57 denote averaging with the distribution function @xmath58 .",
    "the electric field appearing on the right hand side is , of course , comprised of the longitudinal and the transverse part . while the longitudinal component is already known from the charge density , it is the transverse component that is being calculated here . inserting @xmath59 into eq ( [ etransorig ] ) and introducing the local plasma frequency @xmath60 this leads to @xmath61 this equation is a helmholtz ",
    "equation for each component of @xmath53 .",
    "the last term on the right hand side can be deduced from the condition @xmath62 , since it only adds a curl free component to @xmath53 .",
    "it can thus be omitted to calculate @xmath63 , with @xmath64 @xmath63 is then projected onto its divergence free part by calculating @xmath65 with @xmath66 to give @xmath67 .",
    "altogether this sums up to 8 elliptic equations .",
    "however , the time spent in solving these equations , compared to the integration of the 5 or 6 dimensional problem , is negligible .",
    "this situation is different in pic simulations .",
    "one has to compare about 30 particles per cell used in standard pic simulations to @xmath68 - @xmath69 mesh points for the resolution of the velocity space used in vlasov codes .",
    "for this reason the computational effort of solving the above elliptic equations has an effect on the total computational time in standard pic simulations , but not in vlasov simulations .",
    "in this section we briefly present the numerical scheme used for integrating the vlasov equation .",
    "this scheme has originally been presented in filbet et al . @xcite .",
    "the scheme uses a flux conservative formulation and is based on a third order reconstruction of the primitive of the distribution function using a fixed stencil .    to formulate the scheme we start from the observation that in hamiltonian systems the values of the distribution function are transported along the characteristics @xmath70 here",
    "@xmath71 denotes the characteristic with parameter @xmath72 that satisfies , where in general @xmath73 . for the rest of this section , we restrict the calculations to one dimension .",
    "the generalisation to the higher dimensional system will be given later .",
    "we thus assume @xmath74",
    ". then we can integrate ( [ charactransport ] ) and obtain a propagator from time @xmath75 to time @xmath76",
    "@xmath77    here @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the boundaries of the numerical grid cell @xmath80 .",
    "the discretisation of the distribution function is now suggested by the above equation .",
    "the values @xmath81 on the numerical grid represent the cell integrals @xmath82 we also define the flux through a cell boundary at @xmath79 during the time interval @xmath83 $ ] @xmath84 then equation ( [ charactransportint ] ) can be expressed in the following form @xmath85 this equation still follows exactly from vlasov s equation .",
    "however , the flux @xmath86 has to be calculated , and this requires an approximation of the distribution function .    in the framework of the third order positive and flux conservative scheme , as presented by @xcite ,",
    "the primitive of the distribution function is approximated using a four point stencil .",
    "let @xmath87 then it follows exactly that @xmath88 the primitive is given exactly on the cell boundaries . to approximate @xmath89 in the cell interval @xmath90 $ ]",
    ", the four points @xmath91 are used . taking the derivative of the primitive",
    ", we recover the approximation of the distribution function @xmath92 \\left ( f_{i+1 } - f_i \\right ) \\\\ & - \\frac{\\epsilon_i^-}{6\\delta x^2 } \\bigl [       2\\left ( x - x_i \\right ) \\left ( x - x_{i+3/2 } \\right )   \\\\      & + \\left ( x - x_{i-1/2 } \\right ) \\left ( x - x_{i+1/2 } \\right ) \\bigr ] \\left ( f_i - f_{i-1 } \\right ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] here limiters @xmath93 are introduced .",
    "the limiters are chosen in such a way as to limit the values of the distribution function to a fixed interval @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the maximum of all @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath93 can be written as @xmath97 and @xmath98    if we determine @xmath99 such that @xmath100 , we get @xmath101 +       \\delta x \\sum\\limits_{k=\\min(i , j)+1}^{\\max(i , j)-1 } f_k , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath102 .",
    "the above scheme was presented in one dimension . to perform two dimensional vlasov ",
    "simulations including magnetic fields , the scheme has to be generalised to a total of 5 dimensions .",
    "califano et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a scheme in which the individual steps for the different dimension are carried out using a second order time splitting scheme .",
    "the scheme is an extension of the time splitting scheme presented by cheng and knorr @xcite .",
    "for the two spatial directions @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the projection of the characteristics onto the axes is simply evaluated from by the corresponding velocity components @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in this way",
    ", the two space dimensions are independent of each other and can be performed sequentially , @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes a time ",
    "integration step in one dimension with the direction @xmath11 .",
    "in contrast to this , the velocity components are not independent of each other due to the magnetic field . to create a second order scheme califano et al .",
    "@xcite formulated a straightforward second order time splitting scheme , @xmath109 this propagator in the velocity directions was then combined with the propagator in the space directions to create the full scheme , @xmath110 in the following we will refer to this method as the _ time splitting _ method .    we implemented and tested this scheme , but found it to suffer from substantial inaccuracies , as shown in section [ secgyromotion ] . therefore , a new scheme for the integration is proposed in this work which we call the back substitution method . here",
    ", the integration of vlasov s equation in the three velocity dimensions is still split into three separate steps , one for each direction . the difference to the above scheme is the way the integration of the characteristics is separated out into the three substeps .",
    "this implies that the concrete implementation of the scheme proposed here depends on the method of integration of the characteristics",
    ". we will therefore quickly present boris scheme for integration of characteristics in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "boris scheme is widely used in particle codes and has the advantage that it is a second order integration scheme in which the magnetic field does not cause a change in the kinetic energy .",
    "the integration step is formulated as an implicit finite difference scheme @xmath111 the electric and magnetic forces are separated , @xmath112 leading to @xmath113 the transformation from @xmath114 to @xmath115 is a pure rotation with an angle @xmath116 , where @xmath117 to implement this rotation the vectors @xmath118 and @xmath119 are defined @xmath120 then the rotation is performed in two steps @xmath121 and @xmath122 this scheme supplies @xmath123 in terms of @xmath124 .    for the integration of vlasov s equation in three dimensional velocity space the three individual integration steps are performed in turn , thus , the integration of the characteristics also has to be split into three separate steps . for this ,",
    "two things have to be considered .",
    "firstly , when integrating one component of the velocity , we take into account the shifts of the distribution function that have already been performed . secondly",
    ", we then have to observe the order of integration , which is reversed with respect to the integration of a particle trajectory .",
    "this follows from the fact that , for the vlasov scheme , the characteristics have to be traced backwards in time .    for clarity",
    ", we will present the back substation method for forward integration of the characteristics .",
    "later , we will reverse the order of the substeps for the backward integration needed in the vlasov scheme .",
    "for forward integration , first , the integration in @xmath105 is performed , as described in the discussion of boris scheme above . for the integration of the characteristics",
    "this means @xmath125 .",
    "when the integration along the @xmath106direction is performed , in the next step , the shift along the @xmath105direction has already been performed . for the integration of the characteristics",
    "this means that a scheme calculating @xmath126 is needed . in the above notation",
    ", it is sufficient to reformulate the integration to give @xmath127 .",
    "this can be achieved using simple algebraic manipulations and eliminating @xmath128 . for the last integration step along the @xmath129direction",
    ", one can find in the same manner a scheme giving @xmath130 .",
    "the details of this scheme are presented in appendix [ appbacksubst ] .",
    "the scheme has also been implemented and it was found to be less diffusive than the second order time splitting scheme ( see section [ secgyromotion ] ) . as stated above",
    ", the characteristics have to be traced backwards in time . to this end",
    ", we reverse the order of integration , without changing the above formulas ; i.e. we first shift the distribution function in the @xmath129direction using @xmath131 , then in the @xmath106direction using @xmath132 , and finally in the @xmath105direction using @xmath133 .",
    "the splitting of the integration into individual steps introduces another problem , independent of the splitting scheme used .",
    "the limiters @xmath134 and @xmath135 guarantee only that the distribution function is positive and limited by @xmath95 from above for incompressible transport equations .",
    "the vlasov equation together with any set of equations for the electromagnetic fields presents such a system . due to the separation of the integration along the different directions in velocity space together with the forces originating from the magnetic field , the single integration steps are , however , not incompressible .",
    "this holds for both the splitting and the back substitution scheme .",
    "the first direction of integration might compress the distribution function in the @xmath105 direction , while the successive integrations decompress the distribution function in the @xmath106 and @xmath129 directions . in the end",
    "the total compression will always vanish .",
    "the maximum value of the distribution function might however increase during an intermediate step .",
    "we present two types of calculations .",
    "in the first we omit the limiter from above completely , allowing the distribution function to rise uncontrollably . the limiters @xmath134 and @xmath135",
    "are then given by @xmath136 and @xmath137 this means , the maximum principle , that was fulfilled by the original scheme , is now no longer satisfied . in the second type of simulation",
    "we keep the original limiters ( [ limitplus ] ) and ( [ limitminus ] ) but determine @xmath95 to be the global maximum of the distribution function after each intermediate integration step for each direction in velocity space .",
    "the third order positive flux conservative method has been extensively tested in one dimension and in the electrostatic limit @xcite . here , we first want to present results of the integration scheme in three dimensional velocity space with a given magnetic field .",
    "we compare the results of the two integration schemes and a standard second order finite difference scheme .",
    "the latter is included in the comparison since it has been used for vlasov simulations of reconnection by various authors .    in the second part of this section we present results of reconnection simulations .",
    "these have been carried out using both the flux conservative scheme with the back substitution method and the finite difference scheme .",
    "results of the two are compared .      to test the quality of the vlasov integration scheme together with the integration of the characteristics",
    "a simple test system was simulated . in this test",
    "only one positively charged species was simulated in a constant magnetic field @xmath138 , with @xmath139 .",
    "the initial distribution function was taken to be a shifted maxwellian @xmath140 , \\ ] ] where @xmath141 is a constant velocity in the @xmath103direction .",
    "there was no spatial variation , and so a simple gyro motion of the thermal peak in velocity space is expected . however , due to numerical errors this peak will change its shape .",
    "these numerical errors only appear in the presence of a magnetic field . in the pure one dimensional advection problem",
    "only small errors compared with the exact solution are found .     and @xmath142 ( a ) initially , ( b ) after one gyration period and ( c ) after five gyration periods .",

    "additional simulations have been carried out using a simple finite difference scheme .",
    "the scheme is obtained from eq ( [ vlasovorig ] ) by substituting all partial derivatives by their centred finite difference approximation over one grid cell .",
    "a third order runge - kutta method is used for the time step . in figure [ figgyroa ] the @xmath105@xmath106 distribution function is shown for the case of @xmath144 and @xmath142 using the flux conservative scheme with the back substitution algorithm for integration of the characteristics .",

    "initially ( a ) , the distribution function is set to the shifted maxwellian . at @xmath145 ( b )",
    ", the peak has performed one full gyration .",
    "a slight dissipation can be observed .",
    "the dissipation has increased after five gyration periods @xmath146 ( c ) . with the above time step , this correspond to a total of 1000 time steps .     during five gyro",

    "these have been calculated over a time of five gyro  periods for different simulation time steps , different grid resolutions of the phase space , and different time splitting algorithms . in figure [ figenergies ]",
    "the thermal energies are shown for both the back  substitution algorithm ( upper panel ) and for the time splitting algorithm ( lower panel ) , both taken without limiting the distribution function from above . for a small time step @xmath148 , i.e.  a time  resolution of 200 time steps per gyration ,",
    "calculations using @xmath149 and @xmath144 grid points per velocity dimension have been carried out . in the case of @xmath149 and using the back  substitution algorithm , the thermal energy rises more than a factor of 4.5 during the simulated time period .",
    "the amount of diffusion can be reduced considerably by increasing the grid resolution . at @xmath144 ,",
    "the increase in thermal energy reduces to around 20% over the simulated five gyro  periods .    for @xmath149 , an increase in the time step by a factor of 10",
    "does not modify the results by a great amount .",
    "the already large diffusion values remain similar although somewhat lower .",

    "this means that an increase in the time steps leads to better results for the thermal energy .",

    "the best result is achieved by taking a small time step and a grid resolution of @xmath144 . instead of a slight increase in thermal energy , a slight decrease can be observed here . increasing the time step to 20 steps per gyration",
    "degrades the results again .",
    "a strong increase in the thermal energy is observed , which is even _",

    "these results differ only marginally from those obtained without the limiter in place .",
    "note , that the limiter ensuring positivity of the distribution function is always in place .",
    "summarising , one finds that the back  substitution method gives superior results over the time  splitting method .",
    "furthermore in terms of thermal energy , the back  substitution method rewards larger time steps ( i.e. less computational time ) with higher accuracy .     against @xmath151 over five gyro  periods .",
    "after five gyro  periods the mean velocity has an error in magnitude and phase from the starting value.[figgyromotion],width=377 ]    instead of looking at the thermal energy , which is related to dissipation in phase space , one can also investigate the gyro  motion of the maxwellian peak . from the distribution function the averages @xmath152 and @xmath153 are taken and plotted against each other through time . in the exact case , this should result in perfectly circular motion with exactly one turn during a gyration period @xmath154 .",

    "for the same parameters as above , the magnitude of the velocity after five gyro  periods is given in table [ tabgyroerrorsmag ] , for the various schemes and numerical parameters .",
    "table [ tabgyroerrorsphase ] shows the corresponding phase errors in radians .",
    "the back  substitution shows better results both for the large and the small time steps than the time splitting method .",
    "the best overall result is achieved by the back  substitution method in conjunction with a small time step and a grid resolution of @xmath144 . only a marginal phase error can be observed .",
    "there is almost no error in the average velocity .",
    "a decrease of the grid resolution results in a positive phase error and a decrease of the velocity magnitude error .",
    "in contrast , an increase of the time step causes a rise in the velocity magnitude together with an increase of the phase error . here now , an increase in the grid resolution from 30 to 60 does not improve the results when using a large time step . for a resolution of 10 and",
    "a large time step only the phase error increases .",
    "one can note , that in all these cases the phase error is negative .",
    "this means that the simulated gyro motion always lags behind the physical gyro motion .",
    "the errors in phase and velocity magnitude are generally larger when using the time splitting method . with the large time step the magnitude of the velocity goes up by approximately 2 to 4 times the initial velocity .",
    "the velocity error is lower when using the small time step ; however , for the high resolution the error is still 20% .",
    "only the low resolution , large time step case has a relatively small error in the magnitude .",
    "this is accompanied by a large error in phase . for resolutions 30 and 60",
    "the phase error is better than the one found with the back  substitution method .",
    "the error in the velocity magnitude here is on the other hand , unacceptable . in both cases",
    "one finds that switching on the limiter does not modify any of these results considerably .",
    "finally , comparing this with the results from the finite difference scheme one finds that the flux conservative approach is far superior in all cases .",
    "although the finite difference schemes show small amplitude errors , phase errors are serious .",
