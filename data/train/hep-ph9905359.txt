    "recently , the cdf collaboration reported on the first experimental observation of the @xmath0 meson , the heavy quarkonium with the mixed heavy flavour @xcite .",
    "this meson stands among the families of charmonium @xmath10 and bottominum @xmath11 in what concerns its spectroscopic properties : two heavy quarks move nonrelativistically , since the confinement scale , determining the presence of light degrees of freedom ( sea of gluons and quarks ) , is suppressed with respect to the heavy quark masses @xmath12 as well as the coulomb - like exchanges result in transfers about @xmath13 , which is again much less than the heavy quark mass .",
    "so , the nonrelativistic picture of binding the quarks leads to the well - known arrangement of system levels , which is very similar for the families mentioned above .",
    "the calculations of @xmath14-mass spectrum were reviewed in @xcite .",
    "so , we expect @xmath15 when the measurement gave @xmath16    there is an essential difference in the production mechanisms of heavy quarkonia @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath0 . to bind the @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks , one has to produce four heavy quarks in the flavour conserving interactions , which allows one to use the perturbative qcd , since the virtualities are determined by the scale of heavy quarks mass .",
    "thus , we see that the production of @xmath0 is relatively suppressed @xmath19 because of the additional heavy quark pair in final states .",
    "the basic peculiarities of production mechanisms appear due to the higher orders of qcd even in the leading approximation : the fragmentation regime at high transverse momenta much greater than the quark masses and a strong role of nonfragmentational contributions at @xmath20 , which can be exactly calculated perturbatively ; a negligible contribution of octet mechanism @xcite because there is no enhancement due to a lower order in @xmath21 .",
    "the predictions for the cross sections and distributions of @xmath0 in various interactions are discussed in @xcite , where we see a good agreement with the meausrements of cdf [ 1 ] .",
    "in contrast to @xmath10 and @xmath11 states decaying due to the annihilation into the light quarks and gluons , the @xmath0 meson is a long lived particle , since it decays due to the weak interaction .",
    "the lifetime and various modes of decays were analyzed in the framework of a ) potential models @xcite , b ) technique of operator product expansion in the effective theory of nrqcd @xcite , considering the series in both a small relative velocity @xmath22 of heavy quarks inside the meson and the inverse heavy quark mass @xcite , c ) qcd sum rules @xcite applied to the three - point correlators @xcite .",
    "the results of potential models and nrqcd are in agreement with each other .",
    "so , we expect that the total lifetime is equal to @xmath23 which agrees with the experimental value given by cdf [ 1 ] : @xmath24 within the accuracy available .",
    "further , the consideration of exclusive @xmath0 decays in the framework of qcd sum rules indicated that the role of coulomb corrections to the bare quark loop results could be very important to reach the agreement with the other approaches mentioned @xcite .",
    "this requires working out the @xmath2 corrections in nrqcd , which possesses a spin symmetry providing some relations between the exclusive form factors . for",
    "the semileptonic decays , such a relation was derived in @xcite .",
    "note , that the cdf collaboration observed 20 events of @xmath25 , so that the consistent calculation of semileptonic decay modes is of interest . for theoretical reviews on the @xmath0 meson physics , see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of semileptonic @xmath0 decays in the framework of sum rules in qcd and nrqcd .",
    "we recalculate the double spectral densities available previously in @xcite in full qcd for the massless leptons and add the analytical expressions for the form factors necessary in evaluation of decays to massive leptons and p - wave levels of quarkonium with different quark masses .",
    "we analyze the nrqcd sum rules for the three - point correlators for the first time .",
    "we derive generalized relations between the nrqcd form factors , which extends the consideration in @xcite , because we explore a soft limit of recoil momentum close to zero , wherein the velocities of initial and final heavy quarkonia @xmath26 are not equal to each other , when their product tends to zero , in contrast to the hard limit @xmath27 .",
    "the spin symmetry relations between the form factors are conserved after the taking into account the coulomb @xmath2 corrections , which can be written down in covariant form .",
    "we investigate numerical estimates in the sum rules schemes of spectral density moments and borel transform and show an important role of coulomb corrections .",
    "next , we perform the calculation of gluon condensate contribution to the three - point sum rules of both full qcd and nrqcd for the case of three massive quarks , for the first time .    the paper is organized as follows",
    ". the qcd sum rules of three - point correlators are considered in section 2 , where the spectral densities are calculated in the bare quark - loop approximation and with account of the coulomb corrections , and the gluon condensate term in the borel transform scheme is presented .",
    "numerical estimates of semileptonic decay modes are also given here .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the nrqcd sum rules for recoil close to zero .",
    "the spin symmetry relations are derived and the gluon condensate is taken into account in the scheme of moments .",
    "the results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "appendices a and b contain technical details in evaluation of decay widths for the massive leptons and gluon condensate in full qcd , respectively .",
    "in this paper we will use the approach of three - point qcd sum rules @xcite in the study of form factors and decay rates for the transitions @xmath28 , where @xmath4 denotes one of the leptons @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",
    "this procedure is similar to that of two - point sum rules and the information from the latter on the coupling of mesons to their currents is required in order to extract the values for the form factors .",
    "thus , in our work we will use the meson couplings , defined by the following equations : @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the scalar and vector mesons with desired flavour quantum numbers , respectively , and @xmath35 are the quark masses .",
    "now we would like to describe the method used .",
    "as we have already said , for the calculation of hadronic matrix elements relevant to the semileptonic @xmath0-decays into the pseudoscalar and vector mesons in the framework of qcd , we explore the qcd sum rule method .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements for the transition @xmath28 can be written down as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the polarization vector of @xmath39-meson . @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the flavour changing vector and axial electroweak currents .",
    "the form factors @xmath42 and @xmath43 are functions of @xmath44 only",
    ". it should be noted , that by virtue of transversality of the lepton current @xmath45 in the limit @xmath46 , the probabilities of semileptonic decays into @xmath47 and @xmath48 are independent of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "thus , in calculation of these particular decay modes of @xmath0-meson these form factors can be consistently neglected @xcite . however , since the calculation of both the semileptonic decay modes , including @xmath51 or @xmath30 , and some hadronic decays , stands among the goals of this paper , we will present the results for the complete set of form factors given in eqs .",
    "( 3)-(5 ) .    following the standard procedure for the evaluation of form factors in the framework of qcd sum rules , we consider the three - point functions : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are interpolating currents for states with the quantum numbers of @xmath55 and @xmath39 , correspondingly .",
    "@xmath56 are the currents @xmath40 and @xmath41 of relevance to the various cases .",
    "the lorentz structures in the correlators can be written down as : @xmath57 the form factors @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 will be determined , respectively , from the amplitudes @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in ( 8)-(10 )",
    "the scalar amplitudes @xmath66 are the functions of kinematical invariants , i.e. @xmath67 .    to calculate the qcd expression for the three - point correlators we employ the operator product expansion ( ope ) for the @xmath68-ordered product of currents in ( 6)-(7 ) .",
    "the vacuum correlations of heavy quarks are related to their contribution to the gluon operators .",
    "for example , for the @xmath69 and @xmath70 condensates the heavy quark expansion gives @xmath71 then , in the lowest order for the energy dimension of operators the only nonperturbative correction comes from the gluon condensate : @xmath72 the leading qcd term is a triangle quark loop diagram , for which we can write down the double dispersion representation at @xmath73 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "the integration region in ( [ pertdisp ] ) is determined by the condition @xmath76 and @xmath77 the calculation of spectral densities @xmath78 and gluon condensate contribution to ( [ ope ] ) will be considered in underlying sections .",
    "now let us proceed with the physical part of three - point sum rules .",
    "the connection to hadrons in the framework of qcd sum rules is obtained by matching the resulting qcd expressions of current correlators with the spectral representation , derived from a double dispersion relation at @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath79 assuming that the dispersion relation ( [ physdisp ] ) is well convergent , the physical spectral functions are generally saturated by the lowest lying hadronic states plus a continuum starting at some effective thresholds @xmath80 and @xmath81 : @xmath82 where @xmath83 where @xmath84 denote the masses of quarkonia in the initial and final states .",
    "the continuum of higher states is modelled by the perturbative absorptive part of @xmath66 , i.e. by @xmath85 . then",
    ", the expressions for the form factors @xmath86 can be derived by equating the representations for the three - point functions @xmath66 in ( [ ope ] ) and ( [ physdisp ] ) , which means the formulation of sum rules .      in this section we present the analytical expressions to one loop approximation for the perturbative spectral functions .",
    "we have recalculated their values , already available in the literature @xcite . among new results",
    "there are the expressions for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath88 are spectral functions , which come from the double dispersion representation of @xmath89 .",
    "these spectral densities are not required for the purposes of this paper , but they will be useful for calculation of form factors for the transition of @xmath0-meson into a scalar meson - wave level , for which @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the scalar @xmath33-wave meson under consideration , and @xmath92 . ] .",
    "the procedure of evaluating the spectral functions involves the standard use of cutkosky rules @xcite",
    ". there is , however , one subtle point in using these rules . at @xmath93",
    "there is no problem in applying the cutkosky rules in order to determine @xmath94 and the limits of integration over @xmath95 . at @xmath96 , which is the physical region ,",
    "non - landau - type singularities appear @xcite , what makes the determination of spectral functions to be quite complicated . in our case",
    "we restrict the region of integration in @xmath97 and @xmath98 by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , so that at moderate values of @xmath99 the non - landau singularities do not contribute to the values of spectral functions . for spectral densities",
