    "processes in which proteins assemble on membranes to drive topology changes are ubiquitous in biology . despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations ( e.g. @xcite ) , how assembly - driven membrane deformation depends on protein properties , membrane properties , and membrane compositional inhomogeneity remains incompletely understood .",
    "an important example of this phenomenon occurs during the formation of an enveloped virus , when the virion acquires a membrane envelope by budding from its host cell .",
    "budding is typically driven at least in part by assembly of capsid proteins or viral membrane proteins @xcite , and many enveloped viruses , including hiv and influenza , preferentially bud from membrane microdomains ( e.g. lipid rafts ) @xcite .",
    "understanding how viruses exploit membrane domain structures to facilitate budding would reveal fundamental aspects of the viral lifecycle , and could focus efforts to identify targets for new antiviral drugs that interfere with budding .",
    "furthermore , there is much interest in developing enveloped viral nanoparticles as targeted transport vehicles equipped to cross cell membranes through fusion @xcite . more generally ,",
    "identifying the factors that make viral budding robust will shed light on other biological processes in which high - order complexes assemble to reshape membranes . toward this goal",
    ", we perform dynamical simulations in which capsids simultaneously assemble and bud from model lipid membranes .",
    "we identify mechanisms by which membrane adsorption either promotes or impedes assembly , and we find multiple mechanisms by which a membrane microdomain significantly enhances assembly and budding .    enveloped viruses can be divided into two groups based on how they acquire their lipid membrane envelope . for the first group , which includes influenza and type c retroviruses ( e.g. hiv ) ,",
    "the ( immature ) nucleocapsid core assembles on the membrane concomitant with budding . in the second group ,",
    "a core assembles in the cytoplasm prior to envelopment ( reviewed in @xcite ) . in many families from this group ( e.g. alphavirus )",
    "envelopment is driven by assembly of viral transmembrane glycoproteins around the core @xcite . for all enveloped viruses ,",
    "membrane deformation is driven at least in part by a combination of weak protein - protein and protein - lipid interactions .",
    "thus , properties of the membrane should substantially affect budding and assembly timescales .",
    "in support of this hypothesis , many viruses from both groups preferentially bud from membrane microdomains 10 - 100 nm in size that are concentrated with cholesterol and/or sphingolipids @xcite .",
    "a critical question is whether viruses utilize microdomains primarily to concentrate capsid proteins or other molecules , or if the geometric and physical properties of domains facilitate budding .",
    "answering these questions through experiments alone has been challenging @xcite .",
    "extensive previous theoretical investigations have studied budding by pre - assembled cores or nanoparticles ( e.g. @xcite ) , budding triggered by non - assembling subunits @xcite , or used a continuum model to study assembly and budding @xcite .",
    "most closely related to our work , matthews and likos recently performed simulations on a coarse - grained model of patchy colloidal particles assembling on a membrane represented as a triangulated surface @xcite .",
    "these elegant simulations provided a first look at the process of simultaneous assembly and budding and showed that subunit adsorption onto a membrane facilitates assembly through dimensional reduction . here , we perform dynamical simulations on a model which more closely captures the essential geometric features of capsid subunits and lipid bilayers , and we explore how the presence of a microdomain within the membrane can influence assembly and budding .",
    "our simulations show that , while the membrane can promote assembly of partial capsids , membrane deformations can introduce barriers that hinder completion of assembly .",
    "we find that a microdomain within a certain size range favors membrane deformations that diminish these barriers , and thus can play a key role in enabling complete assembly and budding .",
    "furthermore , our simulations suggest that assembly morphologies depend crucially on multiple timescales , including those of protein - protein association , membrane deformation , and protein adsorption onto the membrane .",

    "the capsid subunit is a rigid body with a pentagonal base and radius of @xmath10 formed by 15 attractive and 10 repulsive interaction sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] a ) .",
    "subunit assembly is mediated through a morse potential between ` attractor ' pseudoatoms located in the pentagon plane , with one located at each subunit vertex and 2 along each edge .",
    "attractions occur between like attractors only , meaning that there are vertex - vertex and edge - edge attractions , but no vertex - edge attractor interactions .",
    "the 10 repulsive interaction sites are arranged symmetrically above and below the pentagon plane , so as to favor a subunit - subunit angle consistent with a dodecahedron ( 116 degrees ) .",
    "the motivation for our modifications to the model are described in si section [ sec : capsomer_model ] .",
    "the potential between capsomers and lipids accounts for attractive interactions and excluded - volume .",
    "first , we add to the capsomer body six attractor pseudoatoms that have attractive interactions with lipid tail beads .",
    "when simulating a phase - separated membrane , the attractors interact only with the domain lipid tails ( fig . [ fig : model]b ) .",
    "the attractors are placed one above each vertex and one above the center of the pentagon , each located a distance of @xmath11 above the pentagon plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model]a ) .",
    "these are motivated by , e.g. , the myristate group on retrovirus gag proteins that promotes subunit adsorption by inserting into the lipid bilayer @xcite .",
    "the attractor - tail interaction is the same form as the lipid tail - tail interaction except that there is no repulsive component ( si eq .",
    "( [ eq : adh_hydrophobicity ] ) ) .",
    "it is parameterized by the interaction strength , @xmath12 , which tunes the adhesion energy per capsomer according to @xmath13 with @xmath14 ( si sec .",

    "[ fig : model]a ) .",
    "excluders experience repulsive interactions with all lipid beads .",
    "since the mean location of the attractive interaction sites on adsorbed subunits is near the membrane midplane , the effective radius of the assembled capsid ( not including the lipid coat ) can be estimated from the distance between the attractors and the capsomer plane plus the capsid inradius ( the radius of a sphere inscribed in a dodecahedron ) , which gives @xmath16 . as discussed below ,",
    "this is smaller than any enveloped virus , and thus our results are qualitative in nature .    in this work",
    "we are motivated by viruses such as hiv , where expression of the capsid protein ( gag ) alone is sufficient for the formation of budded particles @xcite .",
    "therefore we consider a model which does not include viral transmembrane proteins ( spike proteins ) .",
    "we also do not consider how some viruses use cellular machinery to drive scission @xcite as this process is virus - specific and depends on detailed properties of cellular proteins .",
    "for those viruses our model may elucidate the mechanisms leading up to the point of scission .",

    "finally , the code was modified to update rigid - body positions according to changes in the box size generated by the barostat at each time step .",
    "matthews and likos @xcite showed that hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) between lipid particles can increase the rate of membrane deformation .",
    "however , given that the mechanisms of assembly and budding appeared to be similar in simulations which did not include hi , the timescales for protein diffusion and association are only qualitative in a coarse - grained model , and the large computational cost required to include hi in our more detailed model , we neglect hi in our simulations .",

    "we found that assembly of membrane - absorbed subunits required large subunit - subunit interactions ( as compared to those required for assembly in bulk solution ) , but that such subunits could undergo rapid nucleation on the membrane .",
    "however , we found no sets of parameter values for which our model undergoes complete assembly and budding on a homogeneous membrane . in most simulations , assembly slows dramatically after formation of a half - capsid ( six subunits ) .",
    "the nature of subsequent assembly depends on the adhesion strength",

    "first , formation of a completely enveloped capsid incurs a membrane bending free energy cost of @xmath53 , independent of capsid size @xcite .",
    "this free energy penalty must be compensated by subunit - subunit and subunit - membrane interactions . in our model",
    "the subunit - membrane interactions do not promote membrane curvature , and thus large subunit - subunit interactions were required for assembly on the membrane",
    ". for these parameters nucleation also occurs in bulk solution if there is no membrane present ( nucleation did not occur in bulk solution with a membrane present for any value of @xmath41 because subunits adsorbed onto the membrane before undergoing nucleation ) .",
    "we also considered a model in which the surface of the subunit is curved ( si fig .",
    "[ fig : curved_capsomer ] ) , so that subunit - membrane adsorption does promote local curvature .",
    "interestingly , this model did not lead to improved assembly as compared to the flat subunits .",
    "this surprising result and the frustrated assembly dynamics of half - capsid intermediates reveal additional kinetic and free energetic barriers to assembly , which are geometric in origin . for intermediates below half - size ,",
    "the capsid - induced membrane curvature is positive everywhere , and further assembly requires only a small change in the angle of an approaching adsorbed subunit . on the other hand , assembly beyond",
    "half - size induces a neck characterized by negative curvature ( si fig .",
    "[ fig : geom_assembly]a ) ; consequently , subunits approach the assembling partial capsid with orientations that are not conducive to association .",
    "addition of such a subunit requires a large membrane deformation , which is energetically unfavorable for physically relevant values of the membrane bending rigidity and thus rare ( si fig .",
    "[ fig : geom_assembly]b ) .",
    "assembly therefore stalls or , in the case of weak adhesion energy , proceeds by detachment of subunits from the membrane leading to assembled but partially wrapped capsids .",

    "a second barrier arises because subunit - membrane interaction energies are reduced in regions where the membrane curvature is large on the length scale of the rigid subunit .",
    "this effect introduces a barrier to subunit diffusion across the neck ( see the animation si video  [ fig : movie ] ) , thus decreasing the flux of subunits to the assembling capsid .    as discussed below",

    "because it requires a relatively large thermal fluctuation , scission is characterized by long time scales .",
    "after scission , the portion of the domain not enveloping the capsid remains within the membrane .",
    "analysis of simulation trajectories identified several mechanisms by which the domain facilitates assembly .",
    "firstly , partitioning of adsorbed proteins into the domain generates a high local subunit concentration .",
    "secondly , the domain line tension promotes membrane curvature , since this reduces the length of the domain interface @xcite . while this effect is not sufficient to drive domain curvature on an empty membrane for the parameters we consider , it facilitates membrane curvature around a partial capsid within the domain .",
    "while the first two mechanisms could be anticipated based on existing theoretical knowledge , the simulations also identified a third mechanism that we did not anticipate .",
    "namely , domains with sizes of order 2 - 4 times the area of a wrapped capsid promote long , shallow necks around assembly intermediates .",
    "while curvature energy favors capsid assembly in the domain interior , the line tension is minimized by a neck which extends to the domain interface .",
    "the relatively shallow curvature of such a neck greatly reduces the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers to assembly discussed in the previous section .",
    "subunits diffuse readily across a long neck , and subsequent attachment to the assembling capsid incurs relatively small membrane deformation energies .",
    "the influence of the neck on subunit diffusion and association is illustrated by animations from assembly trajectories in si video [ fig : movie ] .    outside of optimal parameter values ,",
    "we observe five classes of alternative end products . _",
    "( i ) _ for large values of the line tension @xmath57 , formation of a partial capsid triggers budding of the entire domain before assembly completes . under these parameters ,",
    "the interfacial energy provides a driving force for budding of the entire domain , which is balanced by curvature energy in the absence of assembly @xcite .",
    "however , once the assembly of a partial capsid induces sufficient membrane curvature , the interfacial energy dominates and the domain buds . within this region , the number of subunits found within the budded domain and the threshold value of the surface tension required for entire - domain budding increase with @xmath56 .",

    "this result was unexpected  in the absence of protein assembly , line tension triggers budding _ above _ a threshold domain size ; smaller domains are stable because bending energy dominates over interfacial energy @xcite .",
    "however , we find here that partial capsid intermediates stabilize membrane deformation over an area proportional to their size , and thus drive budding within domains _ below _ a threshold size . on the other hand , for larger than optimal domains",

    "_ we found that the dynamics is qualitatively similar when excess subunits are included in the simulation .",
    "for example , we performed simulations on systems with with 19 capsomers , about 60% more than needed for capsid formation . for an injection timescale of @xmath63 ,",
    "the behavior is similar to the small @xmath41 results discussed above , except that subunits on the periphery of an assembling capsid typically form flat aggregates that can hinder budding ( si fig .",
    "[ fig : budplenty ] ) .",
    "for adhesion strengths between 0.3 to 0.4 @xmath8 budding is observed ( si fig .",
    "[ fig : budplenty ] ) , whereas larger values of @xmath28 lead to the forms of kinetic traps discussed above .",
    "our simulations demonstrate that , while a fluctuating membrane can promote assembly through dimensional reduction , it also introduces barriers to assembly by limiting the diffusion and orientational fluctuations of adsorbed subunits .",
    "these barriers , which are not present for assembly in bulk solution @xcite , can engender metastable partially assembled or partially budded structures . while barrier heights may depend on the specific membrane and protein properties ( see below ) , their existence is generic to the assembly of a curved structure on a deformable surface .",
    "we find that assembly from a membrane microdomain can substantially reduce the effect of these barriers , which could partly account for the prevalence of enveloped viruses that preferentially bud from lipid rafts or other membrane microdomains .    as a first exploration of the relationship between membrane domain structure and budding",
    ", we considered a minimal model for a microdomain , which accounts only for preferential partitioning or targeting of capsid proteins within the domain .",
    "our simulations identified two effects by which such a domain can promote assembly and budding : ( i ) generating a high local concentration of adsorbed subunits and ( ii ) decreasing membrane - associated barriers to assembly by lengthening the neck around the budding capsid .",
    "while the first effect could be anticipated from standard reaction diffusion analysis , the second arises from the complex interplay between domain line tension and the geometry of a bud .",
    "importantly , the predicted effects are sensitive to the domain size ( fig .  [",
    "fig : phase_diag1 ] ) , with an optimal domain size on the order of 2 - 3 times the area of a wrapped capsid .",
    "smaller domains lead to budding before completion of assembly , whereas facilitation of budding becomes ineffective when the domain radius becomes large in comparison to the capsid size .",
    "importantly , these predictions can be directly tested by _ in vitro _",
    "experiments in which capsid proteins assemble and bud from artificial phospholipid vesicles with domains of varying sizes .",
    "finally , we consider the limitations of the model studied here .",
    "although extending the model to relax these limitations is beyond the scope of the present work , doing so in future investigations could further elucidate the factors that control assembly and budding .",
    "the effective diameter of our enveloped @xmath64 capsid is about 28 nm , while the smallest enveloped viruses found in nature have diameters of 40 - 50 nm ( e.g. @xcite ) . although the relationship between particle size and budding has been explored in detail for preassembled nucleocapsids or nanoparticles ( e.g. @xcite ) , our simulations here have identified new factors that control simultaneous assembly and budding . during assembly of a larger capsid , each subunit would individually comprise a smaller fraction of the total capsid area and thus would incur a smaller increment of membrane deformation energy when associating with the capsid .",
    "similarly , intra - subunit degrees of freedom could allow subunit distortions that would facilitate diffusion across the neck .",
    "however , note that such distortions would be free energetically unfavorable and thus would still impose a free energy barrier .",
    "we also note that the potential used for the subunit - membrane interaction in this work does not represent local distortions of the lipid hydrophobic tails resulting from insertion of a hydrophobic group .",
    "these distortions would most likely promote local negative curvature and thus might inhibit formation of membrane curvature ; however , they could induce membrane - mediated attractions between subunits .",
    "given the qualitative nature of subunit - subunit interactions in our model , we do not expect these effects to qualitatively change the results .    while our model demonstrates three mechanisms by which a domain can promote membrane deformation , the effect of lipid and protein compositions within microdomains on membrane bending rigidity and spontaneous curvature could have additional effects @xcite .",
    "similarly , for some viruses important roles are played by recruitment of additional viral proteins @xcite , other cellular factors that create or support membrane curvature @xcite , and cytoskeletal machinery that actively drives budding ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "while these results can be systematically incorporated into the model , our current simulations provide an essential starting point to understand how microdomains facilitate budding and , through comparison with experiments , to identify the critical steps in budding .",

    "is based on the model for @xmath64 capsids developed by wales @xcite , but has been extended to allow for physically realistic interactions with the membrane .",
    "our capsid subunit is a rigid body with a pentagonal base and radius of @xmath10 formed by 15 attractive and 10 repulsive interaction sites . while the original model @xcite contained 5 attractive and 5 repulsive sites , the new sites that we have added ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fullcapsomer ] and  [ fig : capsomer_model ] ) are necessary to describe assembly on a fluctuating surface .",
    "the effects of their inclusion are shown in the following sections .",
    "subunit assembly is mediated through a morse potential between ` attractor ' pseudoatoms located in the pentagon plane , with one located at each subunit vertex and 2 along each edge .",
    "attractions occur between like attractors only , meaning that there are vertex - vertex and edge - edge attractions , but no vertex - edge attractor interactions , equation ( [ eq : attractors ] ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the interaction strength between vertex sites , @xmath83 is the interaction strength between edge sites , @xmath84 is the distance between sites _",

    "@xmath86 is the equilibrium pair distance and @xmath87 defines the range of the interaction .    in comparison to the original model",
    "@xcite the additional attractive sites provide a stronger driving force for formation of structures with the lowest energy face - face angles and thus provide additional thermodynamic stabilization of the lowest energy dodecahedron capsid structure .",
    "this increased stabilization of the curved , icosahedral shape is necessary to compete with membrane bending energy which favors flat aggregates .",
    "although we did observe assembly on the membrane with the original model for carefully tuned parameters , the improved model is much more robust , meaning that it undergoes assembly over a much wider range of parameter values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : newattractors_effect ] ) .",
    "the 10 repulsive interaction sites are separated into 5 ` top ' and 5 ` bottom ' sites , which are arranged symmetrically above and below the pentagon plane respectively , so as to favor a subunit - subunit angle consistent with a dodecahedron ( 116 degrees ) .",
    "they are at distance @xmath88 from the capsomer plane , and their projections on that plane lie on each of the pentamer radii , at a distance @xmath89 to the corner .",

    "similarly , @xmath100 was initially set to the distance between the top and bottom sites of two adjacent capsomers in a complete capsid , but then was adjusted to @xmath101 to optimize assembly behavior .",
    "we changed the form of the repulsive sites in the original model ( one top and one bottom site ) to 5 sites for the following reasons . from exploratory simulations",
    ", we found that membrane - subunit interactions significantly constrained relative orientations of nearby adsorbed subunits for physically relevant values of the membrane bending modulus .",
    "therefore , association can proceed only through a relatively narrow range of face - face angles ( in comparison to the angles available for association in solution ) . as the partial capsid grows , the accessible range of angles narrows even further ( fig .  [ fig : geom_assembly]a ) .",
    "increasing the number of repulsive sites and moving them closer to the capsomer plane enables a decrease in the interaction range , which allows a wider range of approach angles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wales_pot ] ) while maintaining the equilibrium angle at the same value as for the original model .",
    "moreover , the reduction of the interaction cutoff reduced computation times by nearly a factor of 3 .",
    "the attractive subunit - membrane interaction is mediated by six sites , one at each of the five vertices and one at the center of the capsomer .",

    "a layer of 35 beads arranged in the shape of a pentagon is added to the capsomer base to prevent the overlap of viral subunits and membrane lipids ( fig .",

    "interact via an excluded volume potential @xmath105 with all lipid beads :          the adhesion free energy per capsomer was estimated from the calculation of the interaction between the matrix protein attractive site and the lipid tail beads lying inside its interaction range .",
    "the number of interacting beads depends on the matrix protein penetration into the membrane ( fig.[fig : adhesion_energy_geo]a ) , so the free energy was integrated over the accessible values of the penetration @xmath59 :      where @xmath111 is the standard volume , @xmath112 the range of possible penetrations where capsomer adhesion sites experience attractive interactions with the membrane , and @xmath113 the interaction energy for a given penetration :        we found that the adhesion free energy is linearly related to @xmath12 : @xmath115 with @xmath116 .",
    "note that this estimate overestimates the adsorption free energy , since it does not include entropic penalties suffered by lipid molecules upon subunit adsorption .",
