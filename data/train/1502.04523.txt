    "one of the central problems of quantum theory , already raised by its founders  @xcite , is the question of testing whether a given physical system can not be properly described classically .",
    "this problem has attracted special interest in quantum optics  @xcite , quantum information  @xcite , and recently even in quantum biology  @xcite . in this paper , we address the problem of not only testing but also quantifying nonclassicality ( or quantumness ) of light or , more generally , of a bosonic system .    in general , a state is referred to as _",
    "nonclassical _ if its glauber - sudarshan @xmath0  function  @xcite can not be considered a classical probability density  @xcite , which means that it is not positive ( semidefinite ) . in other words , a state that can not be expressed as a statistical mixture of coherent states is called nonclassical .",
    "otherwise the state is considered classical .",
    "it is worth noting that if the @xmath0  function is more singular than the dirac @xmath5-function ( which is the case for , e.g. , the fock states ) , then it is also nonpositive .",
    "thus , the nonpositivity of the @xmath0  function is the necessary and sufficient condition for nonclassicality .",
    "there exist several criteria of nonclassicality .",
    "however , most of these criteria can only show a signature of nonclassicality .",
    "they do not provide any quantitative measure of the nonclassicality .",
    "thus , they can not be used to compare the amount of nonclassicality present in two different states . besides the above - mentioned @xmath0-function - based criterion of nonclassicality ,",
    "all the finite sets of other criteria are sufficient but not necessary .",
    "only an infinite set ( or hierarchy ) of nonclassicality criteria can be considered a sufficient and necessary condition of nonclassicality ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "thus , these finite - set criteria of nonclassicality may be better viewed as _ witnesses _ of nonclassicality rather than measures of nonclassicality .",
    "this limitation of the existing criteria of nonclassicality is well known and several efforts have been made to quantify nonclassicality .",
    "these efforts led to the introduction of various measures of nonclassicality .",
    "for example , in 1987 , hillery introduced a distance - based measure of nonclassicality  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the trace distance of a quantum state from the nearest classical state can be considered as a measure of nonclassicality associated with the given quantum state .",
    "this idea of distance - based measures has attracted considerable attention in quantum optics  @xcite .",
    "this intuitive definition is easy to understand but extremely difficult to compute as it requires minimization over an infinite number of variables .",
    "specifically , one needs to minimize over the set of all possible classical states in order to identify an optimal reference classical state that yields a minimum distance with respect to a given nonclassical state .",
    "this is the main problem associated with the distance - based measures of nonclassicality .",
    "because of this computational difficulty , until now the nonclassical distance has not exactly been computed for any nonclassical state according to the original definition .",
    "however , the computational difficulty associated with hillery s original measure can be circumvented by measuring the distance of a given nonclassical state from a specific class of classical states .",
    "this approach was adopted in a few works .",
    "for example , marian  @xcite defined a simplified version of the hillery nonclassical distance for a single - mode gaussian state of a radiation field as the bures distance between the state and the set of all classical single - mode gaussian states .",
    "wnsche  @xcite measured the distance of a given state from the set of only coherent states . specifically , they used the hilbert - schmidt distance of a pure state @xmath6 from the coherent states as a quantitative measure of nonclassicality of @xmath6  @xcite . almost in the similar line ,",
    "mari  @xcite introduced a measure of nonclassicality of a state @xmath6 in terms of its trace - norm distance from the set of all states having the positive wigner function .",
    "strictly , speaking this quantifier of nonclassicality is not a proper measure since some nonclassical states do have positive wigner function ( as discussed below with respect to a nonclassicality volume ) .",
    "similarly , dodonov and ren  @xcite used the hilbert - schmidt distance from the set of all displaced thermal states as a quantitative measure of nonclassicality .",
    "these measures are naturally free from the problem that arises due to the minimization over the set of arbitrary classical states .    in 1991",
    ", lee  @xcite introduced a quantitative measure of nonclassicality which is usually referred to as nonclassical depth .",
    "it is well known that noise can destroy nonclassicality .",
    "lee used this property to define the nonclassical depth as the minimum amount of noise required to destroy the nonclassicality .",
    "this measure is not continuous and for every non - gaussian pure state it is always equal to @xmath7  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", one can not use this measure to compare the amount of nonclassicality present in two non - gaussian pure states .",
    "the nonclassical depth was applied in dozens of papers ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in 2004 ,",
    "kenfack and yczkowski  @xcite introduced the concept of the nonclassical volume , which is a quantitative parameter of nonclassicality corresponding to the volume of the negative part of the wigner function .",
    "a non - zero value of the volume definitely indicates the existence of nonclassical state , but this volume is not useful as a measure in general , since the wigner function can not detect the presence of nonclassicality in all quantum states . specifically , the wigner function of a squeezed coherent state is not negative . as a consequence ,",
    "the nonclassical volume vanishes for all squeezed coherent states , although they are nonclassical according to the definition based on the nonpositivity of the @xmath0  function .",
    "this example implies that , in general , the nonclassical volume is not an appropriate measure of nonclassicality .",
    "various other methods to test ( or witness ) nonclassicality ( see , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and quantify it  @xcite have been developed by vogel  in particular , the nonclassicality witnesses  @xcite , based on the matrices of the normally - ordered moments of , e.g. , annihilation and creation operators , have attracted considerable interest as an infinite set of observable conditions corresponding to a necessary and sufficient condition for nonclassicality .",
    "various generalizations have been studied , including tests of spatiotemporal nonclassical properties of multimode fields  @xcite . moreover , this approach was the inspiration to introduce entanglement witnesses based on the matrices of moments of annihilation and creation operators of the partially - transposed density matrices  @xcite ( for generalizations see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the relations between these entanglement and nonclassicality criteria were also studied in detail ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "note that the majority of these works have solely described nonclassicality ( or entanglement ) witnesses rather than nonclassicality measures . only the more recent works of vogel  ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) were focused on quantifying nonclassicality .",
    "for example , an experimentally - accessible method to determine a degree of nonclassicality was recently described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    with the advances in quantum computation and information ,",
    "many measures of entanglement ( which is a specific manifestation of nonclassicality ) have been studied .",
    "unfortunately , measures of entanglement can not be applied directly to all nonclassical states .",
    "for example , nonclassicality of single - mode states can not be measured directly by using a measure of entanglement .",
    "interestingly , an indirect way to use measures of entanglement as measures of nonclassicality was suggested by asboth  @xcite .",
    "specifically , if a single - mode nonclassical ( classical ) state is combined with the vacuum at a beam splitter , then the output state will be entangled ( separable ) , for which various entangled measures can be applied . for example , in the original ref .",
    "@xcite , the relative entropy of entanglement and the logarithmic negativity ( referred to as entanglement potentials ) were applied as measures of entanglement produced at the output of a balanced beam splitter as the result of combining a nonclassical state with the vacuum . in principle",
    ", one can use any other measure of entanglement ( e.g. , the concurrence related to the entanglement of formation ) to measure nonclassicality using this approach .",
    "recently , vogel and sperling  @xcite studied the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite to measure nonclassicality based on the schmidt rank as an entanglement potential .",
    "note that this measure based on the schmidt rank is discontinuous ( analogously to the nonclassical depth , as it is explained in detail in sec .",
    "iii  a ) .",
    "here we apply the continuous entanglement potentials , which are based on the negativity and concurrence .",
    "it is important to clarify our usage of the term _ entanglement potential _ , which is more general than that used in the original refs .",
    "specifically , we use this notion by referring to any entanglement measure applied to the output of the auxiliary beam splitter used in ref .",
    "thus , in our understanding , the following measures can be considered as special cases of entanglement potentials : the negativity and concurrence potentials , as well as those based on ( i ) the logarithmic negativity , ( ii ) relative entropy of entanglement , and ( iii ) schmidt numbers . however , strictly speaking , asboth  @xcite referred solely to the measure ( i ) as the entanglement potential , while to the measure ( ii ) as the entropic entanglement potential .",
    "moreover , vogel and sperling  @xcite are not referring to the measure ( iii ) as an entanglement potential at all .",
    "we analyze the nonclassicality of states only .",
    "note that the nonclassicality of operations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) can also be studied by applying various measures .",
    "the discussion above shows that there exists a large number of quantitative measures of nonclassicality .",
    "however , none of the measures can be considered as superior as all of them have some limitations and different physical ( or operational ) interpretations . here",
    "we discuss the relativity of a set of nonclassicality measures which can be observed even for the simplest nontrivial case of a single qubit defined as a coherent or incoherent superposition of the vacuum and single - photon states .",
    "we also report our analytical solutions for the lee nonclassical depth , the negativity potential , and the hillery nonclassical distance .",
    "the latter is found to be equivalent to the concurrence potential .",
    "further , we find boundary states , which are maximally nonclassical states according to one nonclassicality measure for a given value of another nonclassicality measure",
    ".    it is well known , and already confirmed experimentally  @xcite , that statistical mixtures of the vacuum and single - photon states are nonclassical ( except for the vacuum ) .",
    "we find , which is the most important result of this paper , that such statistical mixtures can be more nonclassical than coherent or partially incoherent superpositions of the vacuum and single - photon states .",
    "this can be noticed by comparing their nonclassicality for two chosen measures .    for the clarity of our presentation",
    ", we analyze the algebraically - simplest nonclassical states , i.e. , single - qubit states , which can be written in a general form in the fock basis as follows : @xmath8 = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } 1-p&x\\\\ x^*&p \\end{array}\\right ] ,   \\label{rho}\\ ] ] where the parameters are @xmath9 $ ] , @xmath10 $ ] , and @xmath11 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we recall the definitions of four popular nonclassicality measures . and , more importantly , we find analytical formulas for these measures for arbitrary single - qubit states . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the main results of this paper , which show the relativity of ordering states with respect to their degree of nonclassicality . we also demonstrate that the nonclassicality of mixed states can exceed that of superposition states .",

    "we present the definition of @xmath1 in a slightly different form as based on the standard cahill - glauber @xmath12-parametrized quasiprobability distribution ( qpd ) rather than the @xmath13-function used by lee .",
    "then we find a compact formula for the nonclassical depth for arbitrary single - qubit states .",
    "we start from the fock - state representation of the @xmath12-parametrized qpd , @xmath14 , for an arbitrary - dimensional state @xmath6 as  @xcite @xmath15 given in terms of @xmath16 where @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the associate laguerre polynomials  @xcite . in special cases , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "it is seen that all the qpds can be obtained from the @xmath0  function ( @xmath40 ) by its convolution with the gaussian noise . by decreasing the parameter @xmath12 from 1 ,",
    "the @xmath0  function for a given nonclassical state becomes non - negative at some value ( say @xmath41 ) .",
