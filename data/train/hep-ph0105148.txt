    ", the heavy baryon subspace of the qcd hilbert space , spanned by low - lying states with baryon number one and heavy quark number one , exhibits an additional symmetry , viz . a contracted @xmath12 symmetry @xcite .",
    "this symmetry connects orbitally excited states of heavy baryons to the ground state .",
    "this symmetry is distinct from the well - known @xmath13 light quark spin - flavor symmetry which connects heavy baryon states with light degrees of freedom in different spin and isopsin states , @xcite , as well as from the well - known @xmath14 heavy quark spin - flavor symmetry @xcite . an effective theory based on the contracted @xmath12 symmetry",
    "was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the real world neither the heavy quark mass , @xmath15 , nor the number of colors , @xmath0 , is infinite .",
    "however , if they are large enough , the heavy baryons should possess an approximate symmetry and the effective theory should reliably describe heavy baryon phenomenology .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to make predictions about spectroscopy and electroweak decays of heavy baryons based on the effective theory .",
    "the focus here will be on the phenomenology of @xmath3 and @xmath4 baryons and their excited states .",
    "the light degrees of freedom in these baryons are in the spin and isopsin ground state which simplifies the formalism .",
    "the generalization to the higher spin and isospin states presents no conceptual difficulties and can be done by combining the contracted @xmath12 symmetry with the light quark spin - flavor symmetry .",
    "the emergence of the new symmetry can be seen in a class of models of a heavy baryon ( which will be referred to as the bound state picture ) in which the heavy baryon is described as a bound state of a heavy meson and an ordinary baryon @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath3 baryon is described as a bound state of a @xmath16 or @xmath17 meson plus the nucleon . in the combined limit ,",
    "the heavy meson and the nucleon have large masses ( the nucleon mass @xmath18 goes to infinity in the large @xmath0 limit @xcite ) .",
    "the reduced mass of the meson - nucleon system is large , which in turn leads to a highly localized wave function . as a result",
    ", the potential for the low - lying excited states of the heavy baryon can be approximated by an harmonic potential . while the reduced mass of the system is of order @xmath0 ,",
    "the potential is of order unity @xcite .",
    "hence , excitation energies are of order @xmath19 and vanish as @xmath0 goes to infinity .",
    "the contracted @xmath12 group is generated by the harmonic oscillator creation and annihilation operators and their bilinears . in the limit where excited states become degenerate with the ground state ,",
    "the contracted @xmath12 group becomes the symmetry group of the system .",
    "the connection between qcd and the bound state picture is obscure .",
    "however , as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the contracted @xmath12 symmetry also emerges from qcd in the combined limit in a model - independent manner .",
    "this emergent symmetry along with self - consistent counting rules of ref .",
    "@xcite can be used to write down an effective hamiltonian which describes the low - energy excited states of heavy baryons @xcite .",
    "the effective expansion is formulated in terms of a small parameter @xmath20 which scales as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a typical hadronic scale .",
    "the actual expansion parameter turns out to be @xmath2 .",
    "the ordering of heavy quark and large @xmath0 limits is formally irrelevant ; the expansion is valid for an arbitrary value of @xmath23 .    in the combined limit",
    "the heavy baryons contain two types of excitations  collective and non - collective .",
    "the collective excitations can be interpreted as the coherent motion of the brown muck ( the technical term for the light degrees of freedom ) relative to the heavy quark . in the bound state picture , these excitations are described as the motion of the heavy meson relative to an ordinary baryon .",
    "the non - collective excitations are internal excitations of the brown muck itself . in the bound state picture",
    "this corresponds to using an excited baryon in place of the nucleon ( _ e.g. _ @xmath24 ) . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the typical excitation energy of the collective degrees of freedom near the combined limit is of order @xmath2 , while the typical non - collective excitations are of order @xmath25 .",
    "the hilbert space near the combined limit is spanned by states of the form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 stand for collective and intrinsic excitations , respectively .",
    "the low - energy excited heavy baryons can be identified with states of the form of eq .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath29 ( @xmath30 denotes the ground state of the brown muck ) .    the effective hamiltonian which describes the low - energy degrees of freedom contains operators which only excite the collective degrees of freedom .",
    "it turns out that these operators can be defined in a model independent way in terms of the qcd operators near the combined limit @xcite .",
    "one group of such operators consists of the total momentum and position operators of the heavy baryon : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these operators are conserved quantities and are well defined ; they are the translation operators in position and momentum space .",

    "the operators @xmath38 and @xmath34 are ( up to corrections of order @xmath20 ) the translation operators for the heavy quark in position and momentum space .",
    "the corrections arise because the heavy quark can not be translated independently from the rest of the heavy baryon .",
    "these corrections are of relative order @xmath20 and will be neglected in this paper , since we are working only up to relative order @xmath2 .",
    "these two pairs of operators can be used to define additional collective variables . the operator @xmath39 and its canonical conjugate operator @xmath40 can be interpreted as the momentum and position of the brown muck .",

    "however , the counting rules require this kinetic term to be of order @xmath2 . as discussed later , this restriction on @xmath31 means that the predictions of our effective theory for electroweak observables are valid only for velocity transfers of order @xmath66 .",

    "this is ultimately connected to the intrinsic scales that determine the dynamics : the heavy quark and the brown muck masses are of order @xmath44 while the coupling is of order unity , so that the harmonic - like excitations are of order @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the effective hamiltonian , a number of other important operators ( which determine the electroweak decays of heavy baryons ) can be expressed in terms of the collective variables of eqs .",

    ", we will apply the effective theory to study the phenomenology of the low - lying heavy baryon states .",
    "the leading order results of our effective theory reproduce those obtained in the bound state model of heavy baryons @xcite . however , the effective theory treatment has the advantage of being model independent .",
    "moreover , it can be consistently extended to higher orders . in this work ,",
    "we extend the predictions to next - to - leading order .",
    "these corrections contribute at relative order @xmath2 and not @xmath20 as was previously believed @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that while @xmath20 is formally a small number , in the real world @xmath67 , so that the expansion parameter @xmath68 is not particularly small .",
    "therefore , predictions of the effective theory even at nlo may be relatively crude",
    ". moreover , the effective theory can only be useful for describing the ground and the first excited state of heavy baryons .",
    "the second orbitally excited state is either unbound or very near the threshold and clearly beyond the harmonic limit implicit in the effective theory .",
    "one also has to keep in mind that in the combined expansion @xmath61 and @xmath69 corrections are formally of the same order .",
    "however , on phenomenological grounds , the heavy quark limit seems to be more closely reproduced in nature than the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "of course , the ultimate test of the effectiveness of the combined expansion is how well it reproduces experiment . at present",

    "the spinors are normalized as , @xmath151    in hqet , the form factors ( as functions of the velocity transfer ) have a smooth expansion in powers of @xmath61 . as will be seen from the analytic expressions , this is no longer true for the @xmath20-expansion in the combined limit .",
    "in fact , the form factors as functions of the velocity transfer have an essential singularity in the combined limit .",
