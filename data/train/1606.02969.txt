    "although the sm - like higgs boson has been discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , there are still a number of questions that call for physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) : ( i ) the origin of the mass of higgs particle or the origin of weak scale , ( ii ) the nature of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) , ( iii ) the origin of neutrino masses and mixing , ( iv ) matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe , to name a few .    the first question is often phrased as hierarchy problem , that addresses why the electroweak ( ew ) scale @xmath1 gev is much smaller than the planck scale .",
    "one of the nice ways to understand this is through quantum dimensional transmutation , which explains why the proton mass is much suppressed compared with the planck mass in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "technicolor ( tc ) provides an answer in this way , but the naive version of it is strongly disfavored by the electroweak precision test ( ewpt ) @xcite .    since the observation of w. bardeen @xcite",
    ", softly broken scale invariance has been considered as a possible solution for the hierarchy problem .",
    "if the model is scale invariant at classical level , no dimensionful parameters are allowed and the scale symmetry is broken only logarithmically through scale - anomaly .",
    "many authors have studies this type of models where the ew symmetry is dynamically broken via dimensional transmutation in the hidden sector with new confining strong interactions @xcite , or coleman - weinberg mechanism @xcite .",
    "some of the present authors have proposed a scale - invariant extensions of the sm with a strongly interacting hidden sector , namely hidden qcd models @xcite . at the classical level ,",
    "the scale invariance is imposed so that all dimensionful parameters are forbidden in the classical lagrangian .",
    "the higgs mass term arises at quantum level through the dimensional transmutation driven by asymptotically free gauge theories in the hidden sector .",
    "hidden sector couples to the higgs through singlet scalar field only and there are stable or long - lived particles ( lightest hidden mesons and hidden baryons ) that can make good dm candidates . in those works ,",
    "hidden qcd sector was studied in the chiral effective lagrangian approach and non - perturbative parameters were estimated by naive dimensional analysis .",
    "then the same model was analyzed in the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) approach in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the same model using another approximation method , the ads / qcd @xcite , in order to analyze non - perturbative strong dynamics in the hidden qcd models .",
    "first we reformulate the hidden qcd sector in terms of the linear sigma model , in which the sigma and pi mesons are effective degrees of freedom .",
    "we consider a linear sigma model coupled with a scale - invariant higgs - singlet sector and analyzed the masses and mixing between the sm higgs boson , a singlet scalar messenger and the sigma meson . in the ads",
    "/ qcd we successfully reduce the number of free parameters by matching the mass spectra of the lightest scalar , vector and axial vector mesons .",
    "next , we apply this model to dark matter phenomenology . in our model , since the hidden quarks do not couple to any u(1 ) gauge fields , the hidden pions can not decay through the u(1 ) anomaly and are found to be stable lightest particles coupling weakly with the sm fields .",
    "hence the hidden pions become candidates of the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dm . with the free parameters reduced by the ads / qcd",
    ", we identify the parameter space that satisfies the recent observations . then we study the distinctive features of the allowed parameter region and also some typical correlations among various observables .",
    "we address on the possible signatures of the model that can be further scrutinized in the future experiments such as lhc run - ii , ilc and so forth .",

    "the corresponding lagrangian is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass parameter of the sm higgs boson .",

    "the sm singlet scalar @xmath2 couples to the hidden - sector quarks @xmath8 through the yukawa interaction . since there are no dimensionful parameters in the lagrangian , this system is scale - invariant at the classical level .",
    "at quantum level and low - energy scale , the hidden - qcd quarks can condensate .",
    "such condensates @xmath9 induce a linear term in @xmath2 . then the potential of @xmath2 can be tilted and @xmath2 can develop a vev . the vev of the singlet scalar generates a higgs boson mass term @xmath10 , as well as the rh neutrino masses and the current quark masses of the hidden - sector quarks .",

    "our model contains two extra neutral scalar bosons that mix with the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "mass spectra of those two scalar bosons are constrained by the up - to - date experimental results on the higgs signal strengths in such a way that both of them are heavier than the 125 gev sm - like higgs boson . besides the resonance solutions by the sm - like higgs , extra light and heavy scalar particles , the non - resonance solutions are also possible for moderate values of hidden pion mass and decay constant . in that case",
    ", the mass of the light extra scalar particle will be around a few hundred gev , which can be accessible at the lhc run - ii .",
    "the model also predicts the values of other observables such as relic density , dm - nucleon cross section and triple higgs coupling and so forth .",
    "especially , the higgs signal strength @xmath207 will be sharply determined .",
    "the more detailed study on the collider phenomenologies , for example , the pair production of the sm - like higgs boson , could be possible . in addition , more complete studies with the hidden baryons , another dm candidates , can be pursued with the ads / qcd .",
