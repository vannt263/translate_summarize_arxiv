    "when a snr expands near or inside a molecular cloud , the shock driven into the cloud can accelerate relativistic particles , heat and compress the molecular gas , and change its chemistry , in addition to being an important source of turbulent mixing .",
    "if the turbulence is not strong enough as to disrupt the cloud , condensed clumps may be created which eventually may become new stars .",
    "therefore , the interaction of snrs with molecular clouds joins the two endpoints of the life cycle of stars and gas in our galaxy ( frail , goss & slysh 1994 ) .",
    "the study of such interactions sheds light on several different fields in astrophysics .",
    "unfortunately , confusion introduced by unrelated gas along the line of sight , makes it not trivial to establish unambiguously whether an snr is physically associated with a molecular cloud or whether their distances differ and they appear as positionally coincident just because of a projection effect .",
    "morphological signatures like arcs of gas outlining an snr , or indentations in snr edges surrounding gas concentrations , are often used ( landecker et al . 1989 , reynoso et al .",
    "1995 , dubner et al .",
    "more convincing , but also more rare , are line broadenings ( e.g. frail & mitchell 1998 , reach & rho 1999 ) or wings ( seta et al .",
    "1998 ) indicative of shocked gas .",
    "almost three decades ago , goss ( 1968 ) discovered for the first time oh emission in the satellite line at 1720 mhz associated with two snrs : w28 and w44 ( see also goss & robinson 1968 ) .",
    "hardebeck ( 1971 ) found that this emission comes from several compact regions with strong inversion of the oh levels .",
    "later , another oh 1720 mhz emission feature was found towards ic 443 ( denoyer 1979a ) .",
    "turner ( 1969 ) suggested that the inversion of the 1720 mhz line is produced by infrared pumping .",
    "since then , however , galactic oh maser emission at 1720 mhz near snrs has been largely forgotten . in the following years",
    ", the evidence that the three snrs above are interacting with nearby clouds has grown as to make them three of the best known and studied cases of snr - molecular cloud interactions ( eg . wootten 1977 , 1981 , denoyer , l.k .",
    "1979b , 1983 , white et al .",
    "1987 , burton et al .",
    "it is natural then to suggest that this interaction plays a key role in the production of maser emission at 1720 mhz ( frail et al .",
    "several oh 1720 mhz surveys have been carried out recently ( frail et al .",
    "1996 , green et al .",
    "1997 , koralesky et al . 1998 ) in order to find new cases of snr - oh 1720 mhz maser associations . at present , among 150 surveyed galactic snrs ,",
    "positive results have been obtained for around twenty of them .",
    "the origin of this maser emission can be easily explained through collisional excitation by the passage of a shock front ( frail et al .",
    "therefore , the presence of oh 1720 mhz masers is proposed as a powerful tool to diagnose snr - molecular cloud interactions . elitzur ( 1976 ) showed that the pumping is more efficient if the kinetic temperature is in the range 25 to 200 k , and the h@xmath2 density is in the range @xmath3 to @xmath4 3 .",
    "locket , gauthier & elitzur ( 1999 ) found tighter constrains on the physical conditions needed to produce oh 1720 mhz maser emission : the presence of masers imply moderate temperatures ( 50  125 k ) and densities of the order of 10@xmath5 3 , which can exist only if the shocks are of c - type .",
    "thus , the abscence of oh 1720 mhz masers in itself is not enough to rule out an interaction .",
    "since the maximum amplification occurs along the edge of an snr , where the least velocity dispersion and hence the largest coherence is maintained , the velocity of an oh 1720 mhz maser associated to an snr can be identified with the systemic velocity of the remnant , making it possible to constrain its distance .",
    "this property is also suggested by claussen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who point out that the only oh 1720 mhz maser emission observed toward ic 443 appears at the site where clear evidence for the existence of a transverse shock is found .    in a recent paper , frail & mitchell ( 1998 ) surveyed the regions of the masers associated with the well studied snrs w28 , w44 and 3c 391 , in high excitation co and h@xmath2co transitions .",
    "the latter snr is also known to be interacting with molecular gas ( wilner , reynolds & moffett 1998 , reach & rho 1988 , 1999 ) .",
    "the authors succeeded in finding the molecular shocks in all three of them , supporting the idea that the masers originate in post shock gas .",
    "they found that the masers are distributed near , but not coincident with , peaks of co j=32 emission .",
    "motivated by the proposed interaction between snrs and molecular clouds that oh 1720 mhz masers may reveal , we have selected three snrs : g349.7 + 0.2 , g16.7 + 0.1 and ctb 37a , and surveyed the molecular gas around them in search for the clouds hypothetically interacting with the shock fronts .",
    "we used the lowest energy transition of the co molecule as a probe , which is ubiquitous and easy to detect , as a first approach to the structure of the ism around these remnants .",
    "the present observations allowed us to detect several sites of possible interaction between these snrs and the surrounding molecular gas , even at locations where no oh 1720 mhz masers are present ( e.g. g16.7 + 0.1 ) .",
    "these observations provide the basis for future work analyzing molecular shocks through higher transitions , and for comparing the physics of shocked and unshocked gas .",
    "observations of the co j=10 line ( 115.271204 ghz ) were performed with the nrao 12 meter telescope located on kitt peak , arizona , on 1998 june 12 - 18 and 27 - 30 .",
    "the beam size at this frequency is @xmath6 .",
    "a square field of @xmath7 was covered toward each of the remnants .",
    "observations were made using the on - the - fly ( otf ) technique , allowing efficient imaging of extended regions .",
    "three difrerent spectrometers were employed : two of them with 128 channels and resolutions of 1 mhz and 500 khz , respectively , and a 768-channel correlator with a resolution of 98 khz .",
    "an absolute position - switching mode was used , with reference positions given in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "these reference positions were measured to be free of co emission down to levels of less than about 0.5 k. four images were obtained for g349.7 + 0.2 , five for g16.7 + 0.1 and two for ctb 37a . since data at the 12 meter telescope are calibrated by default to the t@xmath8 scale , which is equivalent to the radiation temperature t@xmath9 for a source much larger than the main diffraction beam of the telescope , it is often necessary to apply corrections which refer to sources of different sizes . for sources with sizes in the range @xmath10 , the efficiency factor which converts t@xmath8 to t@xmath9 is 0.85 based on historic measurements of the planets jupiter and saturn .",
    "the aips package was employed for data processing .",
    "baselines were subtracted in the uv plane directly with the task sdlsf , which uses a unique range of line - free channels in the whole area . because of the proximity of all three sources to the galactic plane ,",
    "the intensity distribution along the observed images made it extremely difficult to find a suitable range of line - free channels .",
    "we thus decided to give priority to the baseline removal in the regions closest to the remnants and oh 1720 mhz masers , with possible detriment to the rest .",
    "images were averaged for each source using the task wtsum , with @xmath11 as weight , where @xmath12 is the noise image corresponding to each image . due to the very high noise of one of the original images of g349.7 + 0.2 ,",

    "since most of the material in a cloud resides in the envelopes , this line is adequate to estimate a reliable mass for the cloud . to detect high - density clumps or cores inside clouds , with densities in the range 10@xmath87 to @xmath88 3 , other species like cs , c@xmath89o or h@xmath2co ( mangum & wootten 1993 , bronfman , nyman & may 1996 ) or higher co transitions ( eg . frail & mitchell 1998 ) need to be observed .",
    "frail & mitchell ( 1998 ) estimated the densities of post - shock gas associated with oh 1720 mhz masers to be n@xmath90 3 , and infer pre - shock densities of the order @xmath91 to 10@xmath92 3 . in summary ,",
    "our data reveal the ism structures with which snrs are interacting , but do not probe the shocked molecular gas in which the oh 1720 mhz maser emission is produced , which should be observed in other lines .",
    "large molecular complexes are proposed to be the birthplace of the young , massive progenitor stars of type ii supernovae .",
    "half of the galactic snrs are supposed to be of this type , and this would be the reason why huang & thaddeus ( 1986 ) found a very good correlation between large molecular cloud complexes and half of the snrs surveyed in co. it is likely that the observed molecular complexes be part of the natal - clouds of the pre - supernova stars .",
    "however , although it is statistically improbable that such a good correlation arises from chance superpositions , there is very little direct evidence that snrs are actually in physical contact with the molecular clouds observed .",
    "shocked - excited 1720 mhz oh masers toward snrs constitute a powerful tool to ensure on safe grounds that the molecular structures at the same velocity of the masers are physically related to the remnants . the use of oh 1720 mhz masers as signposts of snr - molecular cloud interactions allowed us to detect the molecular gas into which sn shock fronts are being driven . in what follows ,",
    "we analize the interaction of each snr with its surrounding molecular gas .      in this case , the evidence for snr - molecular cloud interaction is compelling , based on the positional and velocity coincidence between the co feature and the oh 1720 mhz masers .",
    "this conclusion supports the statement of clark & caswell ( 1976 ) that the expansion has been influenced by a dense environment in early stages . to obtain an additional proof of interaction , we have searched for iras point sources that fulfill the following conditions : ( 1 ) @xmath93 jy , ( 2 ) @xmath94 , and ( 3 ) @xmath95 , where @xmath96 denotes the ( uncorrected ) ir - flux density in the wavelength @xmath97 m .",
    "these selection criteria are indicative of proto - stars ( junkes , frst & reich 1992 ) or dust heated in snr shocks ( arendt 1989 ) .",
    "we have found that the point source iras 17146 - 3723 , which agrees with these conditions , is positionally coincident with the co cloud .",
    "it is unlikely that this iras source is a protostar triggered by the shock wave of g349.7 + 0.2 because of the time scales involved .",
    "formation of protostars from condensed molecular matter needs a period of the order of @xmath88 years , enough for the matter to cool , which is too long compared to the age of a snr .",
    "we therefore suggest that iras 17146 - 3723 is produced by shock - heated dust and , together with the oh 1720 mhz maser emission , confirms the interaction between the snr and the molecular cloud detected here . a thorough analysis of the more extended region surveyed here ,",
    "is given in reynoso & mangum ( 2001 ) .",
    "our observations show two distinct clouds towards ctb 37a , both coincident spatially and in velocity with the two groups of oh 1720 mhz masers .",
    "thus , the present co data provide additional support to the theory of the two overlapped snrs",
    ". however , the complexity of the co distribution in this direction makes it difficult to identify molecular clouds interacting with the snr shock fronts .",
    "one of the remnants , g348.5 + 0.1 , has a characteristic `` breakout '' morphology , which would imply a strong density gradient .",
    "nevertheless , there is no correspondence between the co distribution and such radio morphology .",
    "this is in contrast with the case of 3c 391 , where the @xmath86co distribution shows a molecular cloud exactly parallel to the bright radio emission ridge ( wilner et al .",
    "1998 ) . as in the case of g349.7 + 0.2 , an additional evidence for interaction is given by the iras point source 17111 - 3824 , which has an ir spectrum typical of shocked heated dust according to the criteria of junkes et al . ( 1992 ) , and lies close to the oh maser at the northern cloud .",
    "this iras source is shown as a white star in fig .",
    "5 .    apart from the presence of the oh 1720 mhz masers and iras 17111 - 3824",
    ", there are no further indications of shocked molecular gas such as line broadenings or wings . however , at @xmath98  there appears a bright , elongated co structure positionally following the masers closest to the central cloud . in fig .",
    "8 , two profiles are shown , the upper towards the three masers at the central cloud ( white crosses in fig .",
    "5 ) , and the lower towards an arbitrary direction displaced from the remnant , at the northwest of the field . in the upper profile , three peaks are cleary distinguished : one at @xmath99 , which corresponds to the gas in which the oh 1720 mhz masers originate , and the others at approximately 88 and 107 .",
    "the peak at @xmath100  is also seen in the profile outside the snr , and is commonly regarded as an expanding arm about 3 kpc from the galactic center ( caswell et al .",
    "the other peak , instead , does not appear in the lower profile , so it is likely to be related with the central cloud . at 88 ,",
    "the only co emission observed extends over the area enclosed by the radio continuum emission .",
    "therefore , we propose that the co emission at this velocity corresponds to a fraction of molecular gas accelerated by the shock front towards the rear side of the remnant at a velocity of about 25 .",
    "this accelerated component of the gas would be additional proof for an snr - molecular cloud interaction .",
    "chevalier ( 1999 ) proposes that in the initial interaction , the ( radiative ) snr shell drives a slab into the cloud .",
    "we suggest that in this case , the slab can be seen as the 88  component .",
    "the post - shock pressure is @xmath101 dyn @xmath0 , where the subindex @xmath102 indicates that the parameters are estimated at the cloud .",
    "assuming constant density for the radiative shell , and allowing for magnetic fields , chevalier s model states that the ratio between the ram pressure in the slab and that at the front of the radiative shell , @xmath103 , is limited to the range @xmath104 . in this equation",
    ", @xmath105 is the intercloud density and @xmath106 is the velocity of the radiative shell before entering the cloud .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath107 3  as a typical value for the intercloud density ( e.g. chevalier 1999 ) , the shock velocity at the cloud is @xmath108 . at velocities",
    "lower than @xmath34 , shocks are of c - type ( neufeld & dalgarno 1989 ) , thus this estimate is consistent with the theoretical prediction by lockett et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that the conditions under which 1720 mhz oh maser emission is produced can exist only if shocks are of c - type .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath109  can be reached if an intercloud density as low as @xmath110 3  ( e.g. mckee & cowie 1975 , dubner et al . 1999 ) is assumed .      like g349.7 + 0.2",
    ", this is another case in which the evidence for snr - molecular cloud interaction is clear .",
    "what is remarkable about this case is that one single maser was found to be associated with a region with several structures of molecular gas and more than one site of possible interaction between this gas and the snr shock front .",
    "the same occurs with ic 443 which , in spite of being one of the remnants more clearly interacting with dense molecular gas , has only one maser coincident with a site where the shock is transverse ( claussen et al .",
    "1997 ) .    based on high - resolution observations ,",
    "frail & moffett ( 1993 ) describe the central jetlike radio structure as consisting of a center of symmetry at ra=@xmath111 , decl=@xmath112 ( j2000 ) from which emission extended in two directions opens up into more extended lobes . in fig .",
    "7 , it can readily be seen that the northern lobe seems to be inclined towards the central cloud , tending to enclose the inner co emission peak ( see also fig .",
    "also , the southern lobe appears to the east of the southern cloud , with the oh 1720 mhz maser lying at the contact region between them .",
    "both lobes show enhancements in the radio continuum emission at the locations of the molecular clouds , which is an indication of interaction .    in virtue of the morphological agreement",
    ", the north - western cloud appears as an excellent candidate for interaction with this snr , although no line broadenings are detected .",
    "the interaction between g16.7 + 0.1 and the northern cloud places this remnant in the same class as ic 443 and 3c 391 in the sense that , although the morphologically most convincing site of snr - molecular gas interaction is suggested by a flat radio continuum rim exactly parallel to the boundary of a molecular cloud , there appears only one maser ( actually two in the case of 3c 391 ) , and not at that site but near the opposite side of the remnant .",
    "moreover , the morphology involved in such cases makes it difficult not to conceive a strongly transverse shock .",
    "thus , it appears that not all transversely - shocked dense gas regions lead to the conditions which give rise to oh 1720 mhz maser emission .",
    "possible explanations for the lack of oh 1720 mhz masers in these cases could be related , for instance , to dissociation of oh by high velocity shocks .",
    "the trend observed in these three remnants is undoubtfully a topic that deserves further investigation , and should certainly be taken into account in future theoretical works .",
    "the surroundings of the snrs g349.7 + 0.2 , ctb 37a and g16.7 + 0.1 have been investigated in the co j=1 - 0 transition .",
    "these remnants have been selected since all of them have associated oh 1720 mhz maser emission .",
    "our observations allowed us to determine the density distribution of the ism into which these remnants are expanding , revealing a rich environment in all three cases . in spite of the confusion produced by the ubiquity of the co j=10 emission , we have been able to identify molecular clouds interacting with snrs based mainly on the positional and kinematical coincidence with shock - excited oh 1720 mhz masers , but also on morphological arguments as well as radio continuum enhancements , ir emission by shock - heated dust , and peculiar spectral components .",
    "unfortunately , we have not detected spectral line broadenings , which are unmistakable signatures of interaction . however , there are other cases of snrs interacting with molecular clouds , in which no line broadenings have been observed in the co j=10 transition ( wilner et al . 1998 , dubner et al . 1999 ) . reasons for this non - detection vary from rapid dissociation of the molecules , masking of weak co j=10 features by background cloud emission , and beam dilution of highly localized blast - wave interactions ( wilner et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized below .",
    "\\1 ) all but two of the oh 1720 mhz masers are associated with co emission peaks that posses an excellent velocity correlation with the former .",
    "the difference between both velocities is in average @xmath113  in the worst case .",
    "\\2 ) the masers are positionally close to , but not coincident with , co peaks .",
    "the same trend has been observed by frail & mitchell ( 1998 ) .",
    "\\3 ) the co emission associated with the oh 1720 mhz masers allows constraint of the systemic velocities of the snrs .",
    "\\4 ) the h@xmath2 densities inferred ( @xmath114 3 ) are representative of the preshock gas , but do not trace high density clumps or shocked , compressed material .",
    "\\5 ) several cases of snr - molecular cloud interaction have been detected based on wings , shifted spectral components , morphological coincidences and ir emission from shock - heated dust .",
    "\\6 ) in g16.7 + 0.1 , the oh 1720 mhz maser seems to originate in molecular gas accelerated to 6.5 , and not in the gas located at the systemic velocity of the snr .",
    "\\7 ) the interstellar gas does not account for the breakout morphology of g348.5 + 0.1 , one of the snrs of the ctb 37a complex .",
    "\\8 ) in ctb 37a , the shock is computed to be of c - type , in agreement with theoretical predictions ( lockett et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "\\9 ) g16.7 + 0.1 is found to belong to a group of snrs ( together with 3c 391 and ic 443 ) with the following common characteristic : part of the rim is obviously flattened by a dense molecular cloud .",
    "the morphology strongly suggests that the expansion is perpendicular to the line of sight at this location .",
    "however , no oh maser emission at 1720 mhz is detected .",
    "the only oh 1720 mhz masers observed in such remnants ( only one or two ) are far from the flattened part of the rim .",
    "this behavior seems to contradict the suggestion that oh 1720 mhz masers appear where shocks are transverse .",
    "we are grateful to the nrao for allocating time in the 12 meter telescope for this project .",
    "we also thank d. helfand , n. kassim and c. salter for providing us their continuum images of the snrs . e.m.r .",
