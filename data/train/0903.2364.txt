    "the study on quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phase structure is recently extended to finite isospin density  @xcite . the physical motivation to study qcd at finite isospin density and the corresponding pion superfluidity",
    "is related to the investigation of compact stars , isospin asymmetric nuclear matter and heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "while the perturbation theory of qcd can well describe the properties of new qcd phases at extremely high temperature and density , the study on the phase structure at moderate temperature and density depends on lattice qcd calculation and effective models with qcd symmetries .",
    "the lattice simulation at finite isospin chemical potential  @xcite shows that there is a phase transition from normal phase to pion superfluidity phase at a critical isospin chemical potential which is about the pion mass in the vacuum . the qcd phase structure at finite isospin density is also investigated in low energy effective models , such as the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite applied to quarks  @xcite which is simple but enables us to see directly how the dynamic mechanism of isospin symmetry breaking operates .",
    "near the phase transition point , the chiral and pion condensates calculated in this model are in good agreement with the lattice simulation  @xcite .    in a pion superfluid at zero baryon chemical potential ,",
    "the quark and antiquark of a condensed pair have the same isospin chemical potential and in turn the same fermi surface .",
    "when a nonzero baryon chemical potential is turned on , it can be regarded as a fermi surface mismatch between the quark and antiquark .",
    "the pion superfluidity in baryonic matter is recently discussed at mean field level in the njl model in chiral limit  @xcite and in real case with finite current quark mass  @xcite .",
    "the pion superfluid can exist when the baryon density is not very high , otherwise the system will be in normal phase without pion condensation because of the too strong mismatch . inside the pion superfluid",
    ", the condensed state is separated into two phases . at small isospin chemical potential @xmath0 ,",
    "the homogeneous and isotropic sarma phase  @xcite is free from the sarma instability  @xcite and magnetic instability  @xcite due to the strong coupling and large enough effective quark mass , it is therefore the stable ground state . at large @xmath0 , while the sarma instability can be cured via fixing baryon density @xmath1 to be nonzero , its magnetic instability implies that the inhomogeneous and anisotropic larkin - ovchinnikov - fudde - ferrell ( loff ) phase  @xcite is favored than the sarma phase . in the intermediate @xmath0 region ,",
    "the stable ground state is the sarma phase at higher @xmath1 and loff phase at lower @xmath1 .",
    "the bose - einstein condensation  bardeen - cooper - shriffer ( bec - bcs ) crossover at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials is investigated in the njl model  @xcite .",
    "the pion condensation undergoes a bec - bcs crossover when the isospin chemical potential increases .",
    "the point here is that the crossover is not triggered by increasing the strength of attractive interaction among quarks but driven by changing the isospin density .",
    "it is found that the chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature and density plays an important role in the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "most of the work in the njl model is mainly based on the mean field approximation to the quark mass and on the random phase approximation ( rpa ) for the bethe - salpeter equation for the meson masses  @xcite .",
    "if one examines the thermodynamic potential in the mean field approximation , one sees immediately the deficit of this approach , viz , that only the quarks contribute to the thermodynamic potential with mesons playing no role whatsoever .",
    "this is clearly inadequate and unphysical , since one expects at least that the pionic degrees of freedom should dominate the system at low temperature , while the quark degrees of freedom should be relevant only in the chiral symmetry restoration phase . as such",
    ", this indicates that calculations in the njl model must be performed beyond the mean field approximation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the thermodynamics of a quark - meson plasma is calculated to order @xmath2 in an expansion in the inverse number of colors , and pions as goldstone particles corresponding to spontaneous chiral symmetry restoration do control the thermodynamic functions at low temperature and density .",
    "a characteristic feature of the sarma phase is the intermediate temperature superfluidity  @xcite : the superfluidity happens at finite temperature but disappears at zero temperature .",
    "since the mean field treatment is a good approximation only at zero temperature  @xcite , a careful study on the sarma phase needs to go beyond the mean field .",
    "as for the bec - bcs crossover induced by the change in density , the description on the bec phase at low density should be closely related to whether the meson fluctuations are included or not . in this paper , we investigate the pion superfluidity in the frame of the njl model beyond mean field approximation .",
    "we will focus on the effect of meson fluctuations on the sarma phase and the bec - bcs crossover at finite temperature and baryon and isospin density .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we present the thermodynamics of the pion superfluidity and the gap equations for the chiral and pion condensates in the njl model in and beyond mean field approximation . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we calculate the phase diagram and see the meson effect on the sarma phase and bec - bcs crossover .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section [ s4 ] .",

    "the lagrangian density has the symmetry @xmath14 corresponding to baryon number symmetry , isospin symmetry and chiral symmetry , respectively .",
    "however , at nonzero isospin chemical potential , the isospin symmetry @xmath15 breaks down to @xmath16 global symmetry with the generator @xmath17 which is related to the condensation of charged pions . at zero baryon chemical potential , the fermi surfaces of @xmath18 and anti-@xmath19 quarks coincide and hence the condensate of @xmath20 and anti-@xmath21 quarks is favored at sufficiently high @xmath22 and the condensate of @xmath21 and anti-@xmath20 quarks is favored at sufficiently high @xmath23 .",
    "we introduce the chiral condensate , @xmath24 and the pion condensate , @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "a nonzero condensate @xmath5 means spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , and a nonzero condensate @xmath27 means spontaneous isospin symmetry breaking .    in mean field approximation",
    "the thermodynamic potential includes the condensation part and the quark part , @xmath28 and the quark part can be evaluated as a summation of four quasiparticle contributions  @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the dispersions of the quasiparticles , @xmath31 with the definitions @xmath32 and the function @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 .",
    "the effective quark mass @xmath35 is controlled by the chiral condensate , @xmath36 .",

    "the sarma state appears only in isospin asymmetric matter with @xmath51 .",
    "the two gap equations ( [ gap2 ] ) and two number equations ( [ number1 ] ) determine self - consistently @xmath52 and @xmath13 as functions of @xmath53 and @xmath1 at mean field level .",
    "we now consider the meson contribution to the thermodynamics of the system .",
    "the meson modes are regarded as quantum fluctuations above the mean field in the njl model and can be calculated in the frame of rpa  @xcite . for the mean field quark propagator with off - diagonal elements in flavor space ,",

    "they will decay into their quark - antiquark pairs . as a consequence ,",
    "the determinant in the logarithm of ( [ ofl ] ) is a complex function in the meson energy plane and the imaginary part can be expressed as a scattering phase shift associated with quark - antiquark scattering . from the calculation in the njl model with only chiral dynamics  @xcite ,",
    "the meson width is small around the critical temperature but becomes remarkable when the meson mass is much larger than two times the quark mass , and correspondingly , the contribution from the phase shift to the thermodynamics is negligible at low temperature but significant when the temperature is high enough . for our calculation in the pion superfluidity phase , it can be estimated that the phase shift will be important in the bcs state at high density but its contribution is weakened in the bec state at low density . since we focus in this paper the sarma phase and the bec state which exist at low isospin density , we take pole approximation and neglect the scattering phase shift to simplify the numerical calculations . in pole approximation , the meson contribution can be greatly simplified as a summation of four quasiparticles , @xmath66\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with meson energies @xmath67 .",
    "while mesons do not change the baryon density of the system , the charged pions modify the isospin density when the meson contribution to the thermodynamics is included , @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the @xmath71 and @xmath72 density .    up to this point , the order parameters @xmath35 for chiral phase transition and @xmath27 for pion superfluidity have been regarded as the values minimizing @xmath73 , and @xmath74 has been evaluated at these mean field values , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "while this is a correct perturbative expansion above the mean field , we may ask the questions : what is the feedback from the mesonic degrees of freedom to the order parameters and whether we could improve on these mean field values by regarding @xmath35 and @xmath27 as variational parameters of the total thermodynamic potential @xmath77 ?",
    "we now perform this procedure and see what the difference between the new and mean field condensates is .",
    "taking the first order derivatives of the total thermodynamic potential with respect to the unknown quark mass @xmath35 and pion condensate @xmath27 , we obtain the following modified gap equations , @xmath78 in comparison with the mean field gap equations ( [ gap2 ] ) , the fluctuation part @xmath74 in the thermodynamic potential leads to a new minimum at @xmath79 and @xmath80 that now differs from the mean field one at @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it is easy to see that the structure of the new gap equations guarantees the two phase transitions . from the second gap equation for pion superfluidity",
    ", the trivial solution @xmath83 corresponds to normal quark matter , while the nonzero solution from the zero of the bracket corresponds to the energetically favoured pion condensed state . in the chiral limit , there are also two solutions of the first gap equation corresponding respectively to the chiral symmetry breaking and restoration phase .",
    "we now expand the fluctuation part of the thermodynamic potential around the mean field minimum , @xmath84 and , to further simplify the calculation , we consider the expansion only to the first order derivatives . inserting the expansion into the new gap equations yields the following gap equations @xmath85 with two effective coupling constants @xmath86 and @xmath87 defined by @xmath88 in comparing this group of coupled gap equations with the mean field one ( [ gap2 ] ) , one observes that , in the chiral limit , the two groups take the same form , differing only in the effective coupling constants .",
    "the coupling constants in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels are the same at mean field level , but they become different and depend on temperature and charge densities when one goes beyond the mean field . if we take @xmath89 , we recover the mean field case . that is , in this approach , the contribution from meson fluctuations is fully included in @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the above approach describes the thermodynamics of a quark - meson plasma with both chiral phase transition and pion superfluidity phase transition beyond the mean field at finite temperature and baryon and isospin density .",
    "the two new gap equations ( [ newgap2 ] ) determine simultaneously the order parameters @xmath5 ( or @xmath35 ) and @xmath27 of the two phase transitions . in the chiral limit",
    ", the two phase transitions are fully separated from each other  @xcite : the chiral symmetry is automatically restored in the pion superfluidity phase .",
    "that is , the two order parameters do not coexist in the system . in the real word ,",
    "chiral symmetry is not fully restored at any isospin chemical potential .",
    "however , @xmath5 is much smaller than @xmath27 in the pion superfluidity region  @xcite .",
    "since we focus in this paper on the fluctuation effect on the pion superfluidity , we will , for the purpose of simplification in numerical calculations , neglect the @xmath5 fluctuations and keep only the @xmath27 fluctuations in the gap equations .",
    "namely , we take @xmath90 in the following .",
    "since the njl model is non - renormalizable , we should employ a regularization scheme to avoid the divergence in the gap equations .",
    "the simplest and normally used way is to introduce a hard three momentum cutoff @xmath91 . in the following numerical calculations , we take the current quark mass @xmath92 mev , the coupling constant @xmath93 gev@xmath10 and the cutoff @xmath94 mev  @xcite .",
    "this group of parameters ensures the pion mass @xmath95 mev and the pion decay constant @xmath96 mev in the vacuum .    in the treatment",
    "above , we considered the meson fluctuations as a perturbation around the mean field and took only the first order derivatives in the effective coupling constants ( [ gspi ] ) . if this treatment is good , the difference between the two pion condensates calculated in and beyond the mean field approximation should be small . to check the validity region of this method",
    ", we show in fig.[fig0 ] the two condensates as a function of isospin density at fixed temperature and baryon density . at low isospin density which corresponds to the bec region ,",
    "the difference between the two is really small , but it grows with increasing density and becomes large in the bcs region .",
    "therefore , the approximation with only first order derivatives is good for the study of bec , but the contribution from the higher order derivatives may be important for the bcs state .     is the chiral condensate in vacuum and @xmath97 is the critical isospin density of pion superfluidity .",
    ", width=302 ]    the phase diagrams of pion superfluidity in @xmath98 plane at fixed baryon density and in @xmath99 plane at fixed temperature are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the thin and thick solid lines are respectively phase transition lines in and beyond mean field approximation which separate the normal quark matter at high temperature or high baryon density from the pion superfluidity matter at high isospin density . for pion superfluidity , the averaged fermi surface of the paired quarks is controlled by isospin chemical potential and the mismatch is served by baryon chemical potential .",
    "therefore , the sarma phase which is induced by the fermi surface mismatch may enter the pion superfluidity at nonzero baryon density . in mean field approximation , by analyzing the four quasiparticle dispersions @xmath30 , the possible types of sarma state and their thermodynamic and dynamic instabilities are discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is found that the sarma phase is the ground state of the pion superfluidity at low isospin chemical potential . very different from the bcs phase structure where the temperature of the pairing state is always lower than the temperature of the normal state",
    ", the sarma phase appears in an intermediate temperature region and the normal state exists in lower and higher temperature regions , see the mean field phase transition line in the @xmath98 plane at low isospin density in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "however , the phase structure in the @xmath98 plane is significantly modified when the meson fluctuations are included . from fig.[fig1 ] , the meson effect reduces greatly the pion superfluidity region , and the critical temperature is suppressed from about 150 mev in mean field treatment to about 80 mev in the case beyond the mean field .",
    "a qualitative change resulted from the meson fluctuations is that the intermediate temperature superfluidity or the sarma state in mean field calculations is totally washed away , and the normal quark matter is always above the bcs pairing state . in the @xmath99 plane ,",

    "for relativistic pion superfluidity , the chemical potential which controls the bec - bcs crossover is @xmath104  @xcite depending on temperature and baryon density through the effective quark mass @xmath35 , and @xmath0 can be viewed as the binding energy of the bound state of quark and antiquark in the bec limit . in fig.[fig2 ] we show @xmath104 as a function of @xmath105 at fixed temperature and baryon density in and beyond mean field approximation . in both cases , the effective chemical potential goes up from negative to positive values with increasing isospin density .",
