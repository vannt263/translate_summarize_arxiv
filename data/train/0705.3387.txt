    "the interaction of rare - gas clusters with intense laser pulses has attracted considerable attention over the last decade since spectacular experiments showed how effective energy from the laser beam can be coupled into the cluster , culminating in the demonstration of fusion in exploding deuterium clusters @xcite .",
    "other efforts aim at understanding the interaction of matter beyond a few atoms with light of different wavelength , motivated by the fact that little is known about such processes with intense light of frequencies different than the infrared ( ir ) range around 800 nm wavelength .",
    "first experiments at flash in hamburg have revealed very efficient energy absorption at 98 nm wavelength @xcite and have triggered theoretical research @xcite as recently reviewed @xcite .",
    "clearly , the time - dependent description of a finite many - body system interacting with a laser pulse is challenging .",
    "a full quantum description is numerically impossible and would probably provide little insight conceptually .",
    "one can observe two different strategies in the literature to tackle this problem : ( i ) a more or less full quantum approach for a single atom in the cluster treating the influence of the other atoms and ions in the cluster more approximately as a kind of environment @xcite .",
    "( ii ) a classical propagation of all charged particles in time ( ions and electrons ) with quantum mechanical elements added in form of rates on various levels of sophistication @xcite .",
    "we have followed the latter route , describing the motion of all charged particles classically , while they interact and are subjected to the external dipole - coupled laser field .",
    "initial bound electronic motion is not treated explicitely , but only in form of ( quantum ) ionization rates which are integrated into the classical dynamics with a monte carlo scheme , see @xcite .",
    "the approach works very well , as long as the electrons , once ionized from their mother - ions , behave essentially classically .",
    "this is the case if they are subject to a strong external field ( as it is the case with strong ir pulses ) or are instantaneously free ( as in the case of hard x - rays ) . under vuv radiation , however , the photo - electrons stay often very close to their mother - ions or other ions , effectively screening them and modifying subsequent ionization processes .",
    "the reason for this behavior is the size of the quiver motion ( typically less than a ground state electron orbit of the rare - gas atom ) and the small kinetic energy which remains of the photon energy in excess of the ionization potential .",
    "the latter is not the case for hard x - rays where the photon energy is high enough to remove the photo - electrons completely from the cluster ( at least for moderate cluster sizes ) . for intense ir - fields , on the other hand ,",
    "the photon energy is much too low for the photo - electrons to leave the cluster instantaneously , but the quiver motion is ( for typical intensities ) of the size of the cluster or even larger implying that the photo - electrons certainly will not remain in the vicinity of specific ions .",
    "rather , they are dragged back and forth through the cluster by the laser field .",
    "hence , the photo - ionization of ions surrounded by screening electrons is a phenomenon unique to vuv radiation , adding to the challenge for a theoretical description . on the other hand , as will become clear subsequently , exactly those electrons which screen individual ions define a timescale , suitable to formulate a coarse grained electron dynamics in the cluster .",
    "it is the key to incorporate physical processes which in our approach lie at the interface of classical and quantum description , such as the influence of the surrounding charged particles ( ions and electrons ) on the photo - ionization rate of an ion in the cluster .    in the next section",
    "we summarize our quantum - classical hybrid description which contains the quantum photo - ionization rates of multi - electron ions , the classical propagation , and , as an element in between , the treatment and identification of those electrons which screen the ions . in we explain how to deal with photo - ionization of bound electrons into the plasma of cluster electrons",
    ". discusses as an application and illustrative example the illumination of ar@xmath0 with a vuv pulse of wavelength .",
    "the paper ends with a short summary in .",
    "the interaction of a cluster with intense radiation can be partitioned into three parts : ( a ) atomic ionization , ( b ) cooperative interaction of ions among each other and with electrons , and ( c ) relaxation . during phase ( a ) which lasts approximately until every second atom in the cluster is ( singly )",
    "ionized , one can simply apply the atomic photo ionization cross sections for many - electron atoms supplied , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "gradually , the bound electrons feel the cluster environment , which has roughly three effects ( i ) the ionization potential is lowered through close by ions , ( ii ) previously ionized electrons trapped by the cluster screen the ion under consideration , ( iii ) the global field , generated by electrons and ions , modifies the ionization potential as well .",
    "we will treat all three effects which happen during phase ( b ) of the dynamics in . here , we describe briefly how to extrapolate the known photo - ionization cross sections below the ionization threshold .",
    "the calculation of photo - ionization and excitation for individual energy levels of isolated atoms and ions is straight forward .",
    "including the ( quantum ) photo rates into the classical propagation of charged particles in the cluster , we do not resolve the angular dependences of the photo cross section .",
    "averaging over angular degrees of freedom considerably simplifies the cross sections which only depend on the radial wavefunctions for the respective mean initial and final energies of the photo transition , for a similar philosophy see @xcite .",
    "we start from the dipole matrix element for linearly polarized light along the @xmath1 direction and consider the transition between initial and final atomic states with well defined orbital quantum numbers @xmath2 f|z|i= d_r(_f,_i ) d y^*__fm_f ( ) y__im_i ( ) with the radial dipole matrix element d_r(_i,_f ) = _ 0^dr u__f(r)ru__i(r ) . within the independent particle picture all states in a shell defined by orbital angular momentum @xmath3 are degenerate and have the same radial wavefunction @xmath4 .",
    "it is an eigenfunction to a spherically symmetric effective single particle potential obtained ( along with the eigenfunction ) from the cowan code @xcite . within this mean field approximation the full photo cross section is easily obtained by summing over all available final states and averaging over the initial states in the shell @xmath5 , _",
    "( ) = [ ( + 1)d_r^2(,+1)+ d_r^2(,-1 ) ] . here , @xmath6 gives the number of available initial electrons .",
    "furthermore , in the cluster the ions are surrounded by other electrons and ions . the latter lower the potential barriers for ionization into the cluster .",
    "hence , what is discrete photo excitation in an isolated atom becomes at the same photon energy ionization into the cluster .",
    "therefore , we need an interpolation of the discrete excitation spectrum distributing the oscillator strength over the respective photon energy interval .    in the following ,",
    "we compare two different interpolations . the first one is taken from @xcite .",
    "there , approximate analytical expressions for the photo - absorption of many electron atoms are derived .",
    "the corresponding results for the ar atom are shown in with dashed lines .",
    "for comparison , the cross sections with hydrogenic wavefunctions @xcite are also shown . in the second approximation",
    "we define a continuous photo - absorption in the region of discrete spectral lines by demanding that the renormalized photo excitation cross section merges smoothly with the photo - ionization cross section at threshold @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by distributing the the oscillator strength @xmath7 of a spectral line @xmath8 over an interval half way to each of the adjacent lines such that _ n()= , where @xmath9 is now the interpolated photo - absorption cross section for @xmath10 .",
    "the result ( solid line in ) shows reasonable agreement with the analytical approximation for low and high energies . for intermediate energies , the well known cooper minima lead to considerably lower values than in the analytical approximation which does not account for this interference effect .",
    "hence , we will use in the following the approximation .",
    "the propagation of the classical particles is in principle straight forward .",
    "more refined methods , such as tree - codes are only worth the effort of coding for large clusters ( @xmath11 electrons and ions and more ) .",
    "another issue is the coulomb interaction .",
    "using the real coulomb potential with its singularity is numerically very costly ( small time steps close to the singularity ) and leads for more than two bound electrons to artificial autoionization since one electron can fall into the nucleus ( below the quantum ground state energy ) and another one can be ionized with the released energy .",
    "in strong field physics ( at ir frequencies ) the so called soft - core potential u(r ) = - has been used routinely where the singularity is cut off by the smoothing parameter @xmath12 chosen to get potential depths ( slightly ) below the true ionization potential of the atom or ion .",
    "as long as the quiver amplitude @xmath13 , the cut off is irrelevant for the dynamics , as it is typically the case for a strong pulse ( for @xmath14 and 800 nm wavelength , @xmath15a@xmath16 while @xmath12 is of the order of 1a@xmath16 ) . however , at 10 times higher photon frequency and a factor 100 weaker peak intensity which is realistic , e.g. , for the flash source in hamburg , @xmath17 .",
    "even more problematic is the fact that the soft - core potential is harmonic about its minimum with a characteristic frequency @xmath18 which could become resonant with the vuv laser frequency .    to avoid these problems we use a different approximative potential which has the correct asymptotic coulomb behavior at large distances but lacks an eigenfrequency",
    "since it has a non - zero slope at @xmath19 , v(r ) = - ( 1-e^-r / a ) . here",
    ", @xmath12 is chosen in analogy to the potential ( [ ushape ] ) discussed above .",
    "note that @xmath20 . for rare - gas atoms",
    "@xmath12 is of the order of one : @xmath21 for xe and @xmath22 for ar .    for the photon frequency used here ( @xmath23 )",
    "there is no qualitative difference using a u - shape ( soft - core ) or a v - shape potential .",
    "the subsequent considerations also do not depend on the approximate or exact form of the of the coulomb potential .",
    "therefore we will use the generic form @xmath24 , which could be either of the three options : v(i , j ) = \\ {    ll |r_i - r_j|^-1 & + ^-12 & + ( 1-e^-|r_i - r_j|/a ) |r_i - r_j|^-1 &    .",
    "our numerical examples presented here have been obtained with the v - shape potential .      at photon energies comparable or less than the ionization potential of a cluster ion ( @xmath25ev ) , most of the photo - electrons remain in the cluster , i.e. , quasi - free electrons are produced .",
    "they thermalize quickly , i.e. , form a plasma .",
    "we have to determine which among these quasi - free electrons travel all over the cluster and visit many ions ( delocalized quasi - free electrons ) and which revolve about a single ion , that is , are effectively in excited states about an ion ( localized quasi - free electrons ) .",
    "to do so , we record the revolution angle @xmath26 of each classical electron about its closest ion as a function of time . if the electron @xmath27 moves for two revolutions ( @xmath28 ) about the same ion @xmath29 we consider it as localized , and the period of its motion @xmath30 is then given by @xmath31 .",
    "the average period @xmath32 of all localized classical electrons sets the time scale for a coarse grained dynamics .",
    "this time scale changes slowly in real time @xmath33 due to changes in number and energy of the localized electrons , see . with an initial guess for the first averaged period @xmath34fs",
    ", we update @xmath35 after a time @xmath36 according to the general sequel _",
    "= 1^n_j_=1^n _ , where the actual time interval used is increased by the standard deviation @xmath37 of the mean , @xmath38 .     of the averaged localized motion of the screening electrons as a function of real time for an ar@xmath0 cluster with laser parameter as specified in . ]",
    "the coarse graining of time through the time intervals @xmath39 , whose length is defined by the localized electrons , plays a crucial role for the description of the entire cluster dynamics .",
    "it provides the natural time scale to interpolate between the explicit time - dependent dynamics of the classical electrons and the time - averaged rate description of the bound `` quantum '' electrons . over an interval @xmath40 in time",
    "all processes involving quantum rates will be considered within a fixed cluster environment with properties averaged over the previous interval @xmath41 .",
    "we are now prepared to calculate atomic properties in the environment of other cluster ions and electrons with the understanding that all these processes are for a specific time interval @xmath39 as introduced in the previous section .",
    "the photo - ionization dipole matrix elements for many - electron atoms provided within the hartree - fock approximation @xcite allow one to determine the photo cross section for ionization of individual occupied orbitals to the continuum , see .    to apply these cross sections , we have to approximately map the present situation of a cluster ion surrounded by the localized electrons and other charged particles ( ions and delocalized electrons ) into an effective single ion scenario .",
    "this requires first to determine the electronic energy of an ion with its localized electrons and then to construct an energy - equivalent configuration .",
    "averaged over @xmath39 we calculate the number @xmath42 of electrons localized about ion @xmath29 and their mean energy e^ * _ = e(q _ ) + _ j=1^n _ ( -q_v(j,))+_j > k=1^n _ v(j , k ) , with @xmath43 , the interaction potential between two particles of unit charge at positions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , the charge of the ion @xmath29 and @xmath47 the energy of its bound electrons .",
    "the localized electrons are in excited states of the ion @xmath29 , as shown in .",

    ", we relax all localized electrons but one onto the last occupied orbital of the actual configuration .",

    "<S> the quantum - classical hybrid - description of rare - gas clusters interacting with intense light pulses which we have developed is described in detail . much emphasis is put on the treatment of screening electrons in the cluster which set the time scale for the evolution of the system and form the link between electrons strongly bound to ions and quasi - free plasma electrons in the cluster . as an example we discuss the dynamics of an ar@xmath0 cluster exposed to a short vuv laser pulse of 20ev photon energy . </S>"
