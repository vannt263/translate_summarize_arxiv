    "it seems reasonable to predict that the new gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors now under construction , once operating at the maximum of their sensitivity , will be able to detect gws .",
    "will it be possible to use these future measurements to try to gain information on which is the theory of gravity at low energies ? there are no particular reasons , in fact , why gw must be of spin two . in reality , many theories of gravity can be built which contain scalars and vectors .",
    "these theories are mathematically well founded .",
    "string theory , more in particular , is believed to be consistent also as a quantum description of gravity .",
    "the predictions of these theories must then be checked against available experimental data .",
    "this forces the couplings and masses present in the lagrangian to take values in well defined domains .",

    "the interaction and cross section of a massive elastic sphere with scalar waves has been analysed in great detail in reference @xcite see also@xcite",
    ".    an appealing variant of the massive sphere is a _ hollow _",
    "sphere @xcite .",
    "the latter has the remarkable property that it enables the detector to monitor gw signals in a significantly _ lower frequency range _",
    "down to about 200 hz than its massive counterpart for comparable sphere masses . this can be considered a positive advantage for a future world wide network of gw detectors , as the sensitivity range of such antenna overlaps with that of the large scale interferometers , now in a rather advanced state of construction @xcite .",
    "a first study of the response of such a detector to the gw energy emitted by a binary system constituted of stars of masses of the order of the solar mass was performed in @xcite .",
    "a simple formula for the gw energy was obtained in the newtonian approximation whose region of validity encompasses emitted frequencies of the order of the first resonant mode of the detector under study .",
    "a hollow sphere obviously has the same symmetry of the massive one , so the general structure of its it normal modes of vibration is very similar in both @xcite .",
    "in particular , the hollow sphere is very well adapted to sense and monitor the presence of scalar modes in the incoming gw signal .",
    "in the first part of this talk i will report on the results of an extension of the analysis of the response of a hollow sphere , to include scalar excitations@xcite .",
    "the second part of this talk will be dedicated to a class of recently proposed experiments to measure deviations from einstein s gravity at distances smaller than 1 cm @xcite .",
    "the experimental techniques involved in performing such experiments are tightly connected to those employed in the detection of gw from resonant mass detectors .",
    "i will review the main experimental difficulties in trying to achieve a useful signal - to - noise ratio , estimating the various backgrounds which could screen the gravitational signal .",

    "there has been much interest recently for compatifications of string theory models which could lead to effects of quantum gravity at the scale of the tev .",
    "this idea is not new , but has received new impulse from the works of ref.@xcite .",
    "let me recall very briefly the main idea .",
    "the low - energy action of the heterotic string compactified to four dimensions looks like @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the dimensionless string coupling ( the exponential of the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton ) , @xmath71 is the inverse of the mass scale , the subscript @xmath72 refers to the fact i am considering a heterotic string , @xmath73 is the compactified volume , @xmath74 is the gauge coupling constant and , for the sake of simplicity , in ( [ a1 ] ) i have only considered the gauge and gravitational sectors . from these expressions",
    "i see that for typical values of @xmath75 , @xmath76 is of the order of the planck scale and the theory is weakly coupled for @xmath77 .",
    "let me now esamine the situation for the case of strings of type i. this is a theory of open and closed strings .",
    "the closed string sector generates gravity while the gauge sector is generated by open strings whose end are confined to propagate on d - branes . having in mind a four dimensional compactification i divide the six internal ( compactified ) dimensions as parallel or transvers to the d - brane . assuming that the standard model is localized on a @xmath78 brane , there are @xmath79 longitudinal and @xmath80 transverse directions .",
    "the corresponding low - energy effective action for the zero - mass sector looks like @xmath81 upon compactification , the planck lenght and gauge coupling are given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the compactified volume parallel ( transverse ) to the p - brane .",
    "the requirement of weak coupling ( @xmath84 ) implies @xmath85 while the transverse volume is unrestricted . then the relation between the planck scale and that of the string of type",
    "i becomes @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the parallel volume in string units and i have assumed that the transverse compactified space of dimension @xmath88 is isotropic . from ( [ a4 ] ) i see that choosing @xmath89 and @xmath90 in a suitable way it is possible to find a @xmath91 .",
    "furthermore ( [ a4 ] ) can be seen as coming from the gauss s law for gravity in @xmath92 dimensions thus leading to a newton s constant @xmath93 for @xmath94 tev , i find @xmath95 km , @xmath96 mm ( @xmath97 ev ) , @xmath96 fermi ( @xmath98 mev ) for @xmath99 large dimensions .",
    "@xmath100 is still not ruled out from experimental data .",
    "it is thus considered important to perform experiments to check the consistency of gravity at the mm scale , below which the effect of extra - dimension should be considered important @xcite .    as the prototype experiment to perform such a measurement",
    "i take the setting of fig.1 , in which a test mass ( generator ) is made to oscillate in front of another oscillator ( detector ) .",
    "the frequency of oscillation of the generator is the same as the frequency of the first resonant mode of the detector .",
    "this frequency is typically of the order of the khz to try to decouple the system from background noise .",
    "it is also advisable to keep the entire apparatus at very low temperature to decrease the noise .",
    "the main advantage of a configuration of the type of that of fig.1 is that it is a null gravity experiment : _",
    "i.e. _ gravity is constant between the two parallel plates . in the fourier transformed domain",
    "i am thus lead to a signal which is different from zero only for deviations from gravity which , as usual , are parametrized by a yukawa type potential @xmath101 which expresses the interaction of an atom of the generator plate ( of area @xmath102 , thickness @xmath103 , density @xmath104 ) with the detector plate which is taken to have geometrical dimensions such that its area is much bigger than @xmath102 . integrating over the generator plate and taking the derivative with respect to the distance between the two parallel plates ,",
    "i find the force @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the distance between the two plates with @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "fourier transforming ( [ a5 ] ) leads to @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a bessel function . to obtain ( [ a6 ] )",
    "i have used the fact that only the oscillator first resonant mode is relevant for our discussion .",
    "an estimate of the noise is given by @xmath111 where m is the mass of the detector , k is the boltzmann constant , t the temperature at which the experiment is performed , q is the detector s quality factor and @xmath112 the integration time . plugging into ( [ a7 ] ) typical values for the quantities involved",
    ", i get @xmath113 dyne .",
    "the ratio between ( [ a6 ] ) and ( [ a7 ] ) gives the signal to noise ratio , snr .",
    "a proposed experiment along these lines has been described in @xcite .",
    "fourier transforming the casimir force between two parallel plates , i get @xmath114 for values typical of these experiments ( probing gravity at the mm scale ) @xmath115 dyne that is a value which is a couple of order of magnitude smaller than our noise .",
    "consequently i do not have to worry about corrections to ( [ a8 ] ) coming from lack of parallelism between the plates , the temperature being different from zero , the materials being not perfect metals or the two plates being not at rest .",
    "let me come now to the second source of noise which i have denoted surface type forces because they are generated by the superficial properties of the two plates .",
    "it is in fact well known that if i put in front of each other two materials i can measure in the space between the two an electric field of the order of the tens of millivolt .",
    "this field is generated by patches of charges on the surface of the materials which , in first istance i attribute to impurities on the parallel two surfaces .",
    "an estimate of the force generated is given by @xmath116 the strength of @xmath117 is such that it could overcome the signal from the yukawa potential . from the experimental point of view",
    "this force is dealt with by connecting the two material to earth and among them or giving a bias current to balance for the phenomena . giving the importance of the consequences of the presence of @xmath117",
    "it is then time to better understand the physics of the problem .",
    "if the material of which the two plates are made are different metals , then the electric field originates from the difference of the fermi levels between the two . but even if the materials are the same the effect is still there , due to the fact that the metals are not monocrystals .",
    "it is anyway possible two coat the two plates with a thin layer of monocrystal material .",
    "few angstrm are sufficient to change the superficial properties . in my opinion",
    "this is the most elegant way to cope with this problem .",
    "in conclusion , in this chapter i have shown that performing experiments of gravity at the mm scale is possible given our understanding of the possible noise sources .",
    "i hope that very soon we will have experimental data to discuss .",
