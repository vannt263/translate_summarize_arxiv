    "the modes of an electromagnetic field in a cavity , taken together with their unphysical , longitudinal counterparts , can be mapped onto the eigenstates of the laplacian acting on the de rham complex of a 3-manifold with boundary .",

    "are associated with coexact , resp .",
    "exact forms , which permits to further map longitudinal modes to forms of degree @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "this is necessary in view of ( [ due ] ) , but a more physical justification , tied to the application to the casimir effect to be discussed later , is that zero - modes are not subject to quantization . +",
