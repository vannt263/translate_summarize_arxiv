    "the friedrichs model is a model aimed to describe the basic features of resonance phenomena .",
    "the basic idea is considering resonances associated to a hamiltonian pair @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian for the `` non perturbed '' dynamics .",
    "@xmath4 has a simple non - degenerate absolutely continuous spectrum that coincides with the positive semiaxis .",
    "in addition , @xmath4 has at least an eigenvalue imbedded in the continuous spectrum .",
    "the total or `` perturbed '' hamiltonian has the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a potential and @xmath7 a coupling parameter that it is usually taken to be real ( to preserve the self adjointness of @xmath8 ) and positive .",
    "the potential depends on a form factor function @xmath9 , which determines the existence and properties of the resonance .",
    "the action of the potential is to transform the bound state into a resonance , characterized by a point in the complex plane , as shall be described below .",
    "this point depends analytically on the coupling parameter @xmath7 .",
    "this is the basic description of the model as originally introduced by friedrichs in 1948 @xcite .",
    "the first step to show that the fridrichs model is an excellent device in order to understand the machinery of decay in quantum mechanics accessible to physicists was given by horwitz and marchand @xcite .",
    "after that , there were given several generalizations of the original model for various purposes including a description of unstable theory of fields .",
    "in the present review , we intend to discuss most of the known versions of the friedrichs model together their applications to model various situations in which quantum decay appears .",
    "the fridrichs model was conceived as mathematically rigorous and exactly solvable so that it could well serve as a toy model for a precise description of quantum decay .",
    "also its possible generalizations are enormous in number and vast in applications .",
    "the present review is a first step to collect these generalizations . in order not to make this paper",
    "excessively long , we have selected some of these generalizations and not included a few ones .",
    "our selection has been biased by our own work in the field .",
    "examples of generalizations of the fridrichs model that we have not included in our review are :    i. ) the fano - anderson model @xcite .",
    "this is a fridrichs model in which the unperturbed hamiltonian has a bounded absolutely continuous spectrum .",
    "this model is useful in solid state physics to analyze instabilities due to the presence of resonances ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "ii . ) the cascade model @xcite .",
    "this is a model for unstable field theory .",
    "iii . ) a typical example of a generalization of the fridrichs model that can not be solved unless we make some rather severe approximations is given in a description of the boson - fermion interaction in nuclei developed by our group @xcite .",
    "we also do not intend to discuss some special physical features concerning to decay , such as the zeno effect that deserves a whole monograph both by its extension and importance @xcite . neither the possible relation of the friedrichs model with a model for quantum systems with diagonal singularity @xcite .",
    "we are mainly concern in the study of resonances in the friedrichs model ant its various generalizations and we have obtained these resonances by means of the resolvent and not through the @xmath10 matrix .",
    "consequently , we did not attempt to obtain in our examples the @xmath10 matrix or the mller operators , which being relevant in a study of scattering are not necessary for our purposes .",
    "the list of topics to be discussed in the present monograph goes as follows : in section 2 , we introduce a the basic friedrichs model having a simple and as well as a double pole resonance .",
    "we define basic features in a language which can be accessible to both mathematicians and physicists .",
    "we devote 2.1 , to the description of the resonance that emerges along the construction and properties of its corresponding gamow vector , i.e. , the state vector that decays exponentially .",
    "we also include a situation in which the resonance comes from a double pole of the resolvent . in this case , the exponential decay of the resonance is multiplied by a linear function of time .",
    "the original friedrichs model considers that the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath4 has one bound state only .",
    "what if we assume that @xmath4 has more than one bound states ?",
    "then , the solution to the problem becomes more complex . in section 3",
    ", we consider the case in which @xmath4 has two bound states which become resonances due to the interaction with the potential .",
    "this is the two level friedrichs model .",
    "the study of the @xmath0 level fridrichs model is of particular interest . here , the decay behavior , given by the survival probability , although modulated by an exponential , becomes oscillatory .",
    "this fact has been observed experimentally @xcite , which incidentally shows the interest of these particular model in physics .    in section 5 ,",
    "we introduce two generalizations of the friedrichs model to describe resonances in relativistic quantum field theory . in the first case , two scalar relativistic quantum fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 with respective masses @xmath13 and @xmath14 have an interaction of the type @xmath15 . this problem can be solved on a sector in which a particle @xmath11 decays into two particles @xmath12 .",
    "the solution is provided by a generalization of the friedrichs model , which shows resonances if @xmath16 and can be exactly solved .    in the second case , we study the interaction between two boson fields .",
    "one is a local field and the other a bilocal field with a continuous bounded mass spectrum .",
    "the interaction between these two fields is quadratic .",
    "this situation can be solved by formulating it in terms of a generalized friedrichs model that can be exactly solved due to the fact that the interaction in quadratic .",
    "we conclude this section with a discussion of a friedrichs model suitable for virtual transitions , which is possibly the simplest second quantization of the friedrichs model .",
    "it studies the formation of a photon cloud around an atom .",
    "in section 6 , we present a miscellaneous selection of friedrichs models .",
    "the former is a discrete version . here",
    ", the non - interaction hamiltonian is a harmonic oscillators plus a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "then , an interaction is switched on between the first oscillator and the bath .",
    "the second one has the originality of producing an interaction between two hamiltonians with continuous spectrum .",
    "one of these hamiltonians , corresponding to an internal channel , has a bounded continuous spectrum doubly degenerated . the second one ,",
    "corresponding to the external channel , has a continuous spectrum coinciding with the positive semiaxis and is infinitely degenerated .",
    "an interaction intertwines both hamiltonians . as a consequence",
    ", the continuous spectrum of the hamiltonian of the internal channel is transformed in a branch cut for the resolvent of the total hamiltonian .",
    "this branch cut is interpreted as a type of generalized resonance similar to the one obtained in yukawa type interactions @xcite .",
    "we finish the paper with two appendices . in the former ,",
    "we discuss the concept and main properties of rigged hilbert spaces ( rhs ) .",
    "rhs are essential in the definition and presentation of properties of gamow vectors , or vector states for resonances . in a second appendix",
    ", we show how to calculate the reduced resolvent , which gives the localization of the resonances , for the basic friedrichs model .",
    "although we are not going to study in depth the physical consequences of this model , a comment could be in order here .",
    "with respect to the relation between branch points and van hove singularities , it has been reported @xcite a behavior which is contrary to which is obtained in the basic friedrichs model : for low dimensional systems the van hove singularity leads to a non - analytic dependence on the decay rate associated with the resonance on the coupling constant .",
    "next , we start with the definition of resonance that we shall use in the sequel .",
    "a resonance can be defined into several ways .",
    "it can be defined through the resolvent , or the behavior of the analytic continuation of the @xmath10-matrix .",
    "both ways can be shown to be equivalent in specific models like the standard friedrichs model .",
    "any definition of resonance in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics relies in the existence of two dynamics , a _ free _",
    "dynamics , represented by the _",
    "unperturbed _ or _ free _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath4 and a _ perturbed",
    "_ dynamics given by the _ total _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath17 , where @xmath6 is a potential responsible of the resonance behavior .",
    "both hamiltonians are densely defined on an infinite dimensional hilbert space @xmath18 of pure states of the system under study .",
    "after the properties of the resolvent of a self adjoint operator , we now that the resolvents    @xmath19    are analytic on the complex variable @xmath20 with a branch cut that coincides with the continuous spectrum of @xmath4 and @xmath8 , that we usually assume to be equal , in both cases , to the positive semiaxis @xmath21 .",
    "next , we make the following assumptions :    i. ) there is a dense set @xmath22 of vectors in @xmath18 such that both @xmath23 and @xmath24 admit an analytic continuation through the cut .",
    "ii . ) for some @xmath25 , the partial resolvent @xmath24 has an isolated singular point ( in general a pole ) at a point @xmath26 of analyticity of @xmath23 .",
    "then , we say that the hamiltonian pair has a resonance at the point @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this is the definition that we shall use in the friedrichs model .",
    "a second definition of resonance is also very much used and is suitable for the friedrichs model :    let us consider that the hamiltonian pair @xmath3 satisfies the sufficient conditions such that the @xmath10 operator exists . in this case ,",
    "an incoming _ free _ state @xmath11 ( evolving under the free dynamics @xmath4 ) will undergo the interaction given by the potential @xmath27 and will be released as a free state @xmath12 .",
    "the relation between this incoming and outgoing free states is given by the @xmath10-operator in the form :    @xmath28    in the energy representation , we can write @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the @xmath10-operator is a function of the energy @xmath30 ( and eventually of other variables ) . in general",
    ", @xmath31 is a complex analytic function with no other singularities than a branch cut coinciding with the positive semiaxis ( and we assume that @xmath21 is the continuous spectrum of both @xmath4 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if the function of complex variable @xmath32 determined by @xmath31 has analytic continuation through the cut ( and this can be shown to be the case under very general causality conditions @xcite ) and this continuation has poles outside the negative part of the real axis ( then these poles come in complex conjugate pairs ) , then these poles are assumed to be resonance poles @xcite .",
    "thus , each resonance pole has a real part @xmath33 and a nonzero imaginary part @xmath34 .",
    "the energy @xmath33 corresponds to the maximum of the bump of the cross section ( whenever this equivalence applies ) or the resonance energy and @xmath35 is the width of this bump ( related to the mean life of the resonance ) .",
    "the relation between the latter definition of resonance and other definitions ( bump in the cross section , sudden change in the phase shift , etc ) is discussed in @xcite .",
    "there are other definitions of resonances in quantum mechanics that appear in the literature . under general conditions , these definitions are equivalent either to the resolvent or the @xmath10 matrix point of view .",
    "these are :    i. ) resonances are the eigenvalues of the dilated hamiltonian .",
    "a dilation ( or dilatation ) is a transformation @xmath36 on @xmath37 depending on a complex parameter @xmath38 , defined as follows :",
    "@xmath39 clearly if @xmath38 is real , @xmath36 is unitary .",
    "dilations are used to define a large class of nonlocal potentials called dilation analytic potentials @xcite .",
    "if @xmath6 is a dilation analytic potential , then define :    @xmath40u^{-1}(\\theta)=e^{-2\\theta}\\,h_0+v(\\theta)\\,.\\ ] ] then , resonances are the solutions of the eigenvalue equation :    @xmath41 the value of the eigenvalue @xmath42 of @xmath43 does not depend on the parameter @xmath38 and these eigenvalues are resonances according to the definition which makes use of the partial resolvent . for details , see @xcite . dilatations really provide a method to obtain resonances called the _ complex scaling method_.    ii . ) when the potential is spherically symmetric , one form of finding resonances is obtaining solutions of the schrdinger equation with complex eigenvalues , @xmath44 satisfying the so called _ purely outgoing boundary conditions_. this means that as @xmath45 , then @xmath46 , i.e. , only outgoing wave function can exists .",
    "these complex eigenvalues @xmath26 can be identified with resonances and are poles of the @xmath10 matrix .",
    "resonances are also defined as complex eigenvalues of a dissipative operator in the context of the lax - phillips formalism .",
    "this can be found in @xcite .",
    "there are relations between these definitions of resonances .",
    "as was mentioned above , some of them are consequences of others . for a review in this subject , see @xcite and references thereof .",
    "we shall present in here the friedrichs model in its most simple form , which has been described in many places @xcite .",
    "we can introduced it in two different languages : hilbert space language or bra ket formalism .",
    "the latter makes use of the rigged hilbert space construction that we describe in the last part of the present review .",
    "although we shall use of the bra - ket formalism along our presentation , we discuss briefly the hilbert space presentation first and then we shall go to the second one which is more familiar to most users . then , in its simplest basic form , the friedrichs model includes the following ingredients :    1.- a ( infinite dimensional ) hilbert space @xmath18 .",
    "if we use the energy representation , this hilbert space is given by :    @xmath47    here , @xmath48 is the field of complex numbers , @xmath21 is the positive semiaxis @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the hilbert space of square integrable functions on @xmath21 .",
    "we say that we are using the energy representation because the hamiltonians we shall use in this friedrichs model will have a continuous spectrum coinciding with @xmath21 , then the space of the wave functions in the energy representation is then @xmath50 .",

    "we conclude that , by construction , @xmath4 has a non degenerate absolutely continuous spectrum that coincides with @xmath66 , plus an eigenvalue , @xmath61 .",
    "since @xmath62 , this unique eigenvalue of @xmath4 is embedded in the continuous spectrum of @xmath4 .",
    "3.- the total hamiltonian has the form @xmath5 , where @xmath7 is a coupling constant and @xmath6 is a potential to be defined . in order to create resonances",
    ", @xmath6 should produce an interaction between discrete and continuous parts of @xmath4 .",

    "if this were the case , the domain of @xmath6 is @xmath18 ( and @xmath6 is bounded ! ) and the domain of @xmath8 coincides with the domain of @xmath4 .",
    "this may suggest that we can not allow into its antidual @xmath70 .",

    "the total hamiltonian @xmath8 has a continuous nondegenerate spectrum equal to @xmath66 .",
    "so far , we have introduced the basic features of the friedrichs model , without a discussion of its properties .",
    "let us translate the above definition in terms of the bra - ket formalism .",
    "we have already defined the ket @xmath71 . for each @xmath72 in the ( absolutely ) continuous spectrum of @xmath4",
    ", there is an ( generalized ) eigenvector of @xmath4 , @xmath73 , with eigenvalue @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath74 . taking this into account",
    ", we can use the following notation for an arbitrary vector @xmath11 as in ( [ 3 ] ) :    @xmath75    the expression for the free hamiltonian can be derived from the spectral representation theorem @xcite ( see the specific form to translate integral spectral representations into the bra - ket formalism in @xcite and a generalization in @xcite ) . in our case , it takes the following form :    @xmath76 is the projection into the bound state @xmath77 of @xmath4 and @xmath78 a similar object that can be defined for @xmath73 can be written as @xmath79 .",
    "see @xcite . ] .",

    "we recall that the form factor should be kept square integrable on the positive semiaxis if we want to keep the model in the context of hilbert space , although this restriction may be unnecessary .",
    "also , the form factor could be real or complex , it does not matter . from ( [ 10 ] ) , we clearly see that @xmath6 produces an interaction between the continuous and discrete parts of @xmath4 modelled by the form factor function .",
    "we want to repeat again that the interaction also depends on the form factor @xmath7 , so that @xmath5 .",
    "we want to show that even this simple friedrichs model shows resonance behavior .",
    "in fact , this resonance is produced when the action of the interaction `` dissolves '' the discrete spectrum of @xmath4 in the continuum .",
    "this process depends crucially of the form factor @xmath9 .",
    "the position of the resonance will also depend on the coupling constant @xmath7 @xcite .    in order to search for resonance behavior",
    ", we need to fix a definition of resonance and we shall use the definition proposed in @xcite that we have presented earlier ( see ( [ 1 ] ) ) .",
    "accordingly , let us consider the projection @xmath81 into the subspace spanned by the eigenvector @xmath77 of @xmath4 .",
    "pick @xmath51 , as in ( [ 9 ] ) . then , @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the identity operator . then , consider the function on the complex variable @xmath20 , depending of the vector @xmath51 :    @xmath84    the real number @xmath85 is irrelevant in the discussion of the analytic properties of @xmath86 , which are only contained in the following function independent of @xmath11 :    @xmath87    if this function , has an analytic continuation and the continuation has an isolated pole at @xmath88 with nonzero imaginary part , this pole should be associated to a resonance , according to the definition of resonances from the resolvent properties @xcite . the real part of @xmath26 , @xmath33 is the resonance energy ( or location of the maximum of the bump of the cross section ) and @xmath89 the width of the bump .    by extension , ( [ 14 ] ) is also called the reduced resolvent .",
    "some sufficient conditions for this analytic continuation to exist and have the desired properties have been studied in @xcite .",
    "these are conditions on the form factor @xmath90 . under these conditions",
    ", we can find an explicit expression for @xmath91 in ( [ 4 ] ) @xcite :    @xmath92    under the sufficient conditions mentioned earlier @xcite , @xmath91 is an analytic function on the complex plane @xmath48 with a cut coinciding with the positive semiaxis ( the continuous spectrum of both @xmath4 and @xmath8 ) and admits analytic continuations beyond the cut from above to below and from below to above . in the first case , the boundary values of the function on the positive semiaxis are given by :    @xmath93    and in the second :    @xmath94    these analytic continuations have respective zeroes at the points @xmath88 and its complex conjugate @xmath95 ( observe that ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) are complex conjugate of each other ) , under the mentioned sufficient conditions @xcite . correspondingly , the analytic continuation of the inverses @xmath96 and @xmath97 have poles at @xmath26 and @xmath98 respectively .",

    "these resonance poles may be simple or multiple .",
    "the case of the friedrichs model with simple pole resonances is the easiest to study , yet containing all the nontrivial information concerning resonance behavior . as we have seen before , these resonance poles come into complex conjugate pairs .",
    "the next objective is to find the gamow vector for this resonance . with this goal ,",
    "let us construct the general state vector in the following form :    @xmath99    we want to emphasize that discrete and continuous degrees of freedom are orthogonal with both discrete and continuous spectrum , the space spanned by the bound states is always orthogonal to the space spanned by the scattering states . ] .",
    "this idea implies the following relations :    @xmath100    the gamow vectors are defined as the generalized eigenvectors of the total hamiltonian with complex eigenvalues .",

    ", there is a rigged hilbert space @xmath1061 , such that i. ) @xmath1062 , ii . )",
    "@xmath4 is continuous on @xmath445 with its own topology and iii . ) for any @xmath1063 , the absolutely continuous spectrum of @xmath4 , there exists a @xmath1064 with @xmath1065 .",
    "let us recall ( [ a16 ] ) , let us omit the arbitrary @xmath1066 and let us choose @xmath1067 and @xmath1068 ( in order to be consistent with the usual notation for the eigenvalues of @xmath4 , we shall use @xmath72 instead of @xmath7 in ( [ a15 ] ) and ( [ a16 ] ) ) . then , according to the gelfand - maurin theorem , one gets for the continuous part of @xmath4 the following generalized expansion    @xmath1069    as the continuous spectrum of @xmath4 is purely absolutely continuous and non - degenerated , ( [ r1 ] ) can be written as @xcite    @xmath1070    in addition to the continuous spectrum , @xmath4 has an eigenvector that we have called @xmath77 ( @xmath1071 ) .",
    "then , the complete expansion of @xmath4 in terms of its generalized eigenvectors with eigenvalues on its hilbert space spectrum is given by ( [ 10 ] ) , i.e. ,    latexmath:[\\[\\label{r3 } h_0=\\omega_0\\,|1\\rangle\\langle 1|+\\int_0^\\infty     the explicit form of a rhs that implements in our case the conditions of the gelfand - maurin theorem is easy to find .",
    "in fact , we shall have a pair of rhs that satify these conditions .",
    "in addition , both members of the pair of gamow vectors that describes the resonance will be functionals on each of these rhs .",
    "these rhs are very easy to construct .",
    "in fact , as @xmath4 has a bound state and a non - degenerate continuous spectrum covering the positive semiaxis , the minimal hilbert space in which @xmath4 acts is given by    @xmath1073    where @xmath48 denotes the set of complex numbers and @xmath1074 direct sum .",
    "all vectors in ( [ r4 ] ) have the form ( [ 3 ] ) .    in our case , the vector space of test functions should have certain analyticity conditions so that the antiduals contain the gamow vectors .",
    "several motivations ( see @xcite ) suggest the use of functions which are at the same time hardy and schwartz , so that the spaces of test vectors are given by    @xmath1075    where @xmath567 denotes the schwartz space , @xmath1041 the space of hardy functions on the upper ( with @xmath252 ) and lower ( with @xmath251 ) half planes .",
    "these functions are restricted to the positive semiaxis because they represent wave functions in the energy representation and we assume that the energy is always positive .",
    "note that the values of a hardy function on the positive semaixis determine all its values as a consequence of a theorem due to van winter @xcite .",
    "finally , the rhs for the basic friedrichs model is the following :    @xmath1076    note that the duals @xmath1077 .",
    "the gamow vectors @xmath1078 , @xmath1079 , belong to @xmath202 and the gamow vectors @xmath1080 , @xmath1079 , belong to @xmath194 .",
    "we recall that the potential is given by ( [ 11 ] ) , i.e. ,    @xmath1081    note that if @xmath9 is a square integrable function , then @xmath6 is a bounded operator from @xmath18 into @xmath18 .",
    "the proof goes as follows : take @xmath11 as in ( [ 3 ] ) , then    @xmath1082     & \\le & ||f||^2\\,||\\varphi||^2+|\\alpha|^2\\,||f||^2=||f||^2(|\\alpha|^2+||\\varphi||^2 )     \\nonumber\\\\[2ex ]    & = & ||f||^2\\,||\\psi||^2\\ , .",
    "\\label{r8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since @xmath11 is arbitrary , we conclude that @xmath6 is bounded .",
    "in addition , @xmath6 is hermitian .",
    "then , a consequence of the kato - rellich theorem @xcite establishes that @xmath1083 is self adjoint on @xmath18 .",
    "this is true for any square integrable form factor @xmath9 .",
    "if , in addition , @xmath1084 , @xmath8 is continuous on @xmath1085 respectively and can be extended into a weakly continuous operator on the antiduals .",
    "then , the action of @xmath8 on the gamow vector makes sense .",
    "it could happen that @xmath9 is not in this class , still being square integrable , or even that @xmath9 were not square integrable , being for instance a polynomial in the variable @xmath72 . in this cases and in some others ( like for instance",
    "if the form factor @xmath9 is a dirac delta ) , @xmath8 is a continuous mapping from the space of test functions into the antiduals :    @xmath1086    in some cases , the domain of @xmath8 can be extended to some subspaces of @xmath1087 like for instance to the spaces spanned by the gamow vectors .",
    "this happens for instance in the two situations mentioned before of square integrable or polynomial form factor , also the form factor @xmath1088 for the double pole resonances in the friedrichs model is of this form .",
    "then , the extension of @xmath8 into the antiduals can not be produced by the duality formula ( [ a5 ] ) , but instead by completion @xcite .",
    "note that this type of extensions may not be extended into the whole antiduals .",
    "other types of more sophisticated friedrichs model need different rhs construction . along the present work",
    ", we make a case by case study of these different types of constructions .",
    "in this appendix , we want to obtain the expression of the reduced resolvent for the simplest form of the friedrichs model leading to equation ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "we shall make use of operator theory and follow the guidelines of @xcite .",
    "in fact , we want to show that            @xmath1093 \\varphi(\\omega ) \\end{array } \\right)\\nonumber\\\\[2ex ] = qv\\ , \\left(\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\[2ex ] \\varphi(\\omega ) \\end{array } \\right ) = q\\ , \\left(\\begin{array}{c } \\int_0^\\infty f(\\omega)\\,\\varphi(\\omega)\\,d\\omega \\\\[2ex ] 0   \\end{array}\\right)= \\left(\\begin{array}{c } 0\\\\[2ex ] 0 \\end{array}\\right)\\ , . \\label{c3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      the second step in the proof of ( [ c1 ] ) is noting that the projectors @xmath735 and @xmath1094 commute with the free hamiltonian @xmath4 . since @xmath1095 , this claim would be shown if we can see that @xmath1096 .",
