    "one of the most important problems of modern astrophysics is to explain how cosmic ray particles are accelerated to relativistic energies in powerful sources of nonthermal radiation .",
    "diffusive first - order fermi acceleration at nonrelativistic shock fronts has been regarded as a prime candidate for particle acceleration in astrophysics ( for reviews see drury 1983 ; blandford and eichler 1987 ) .",
    "modern tev air - cherenkov telescopes have indeed resolved the shock regions in supernova remnants and identied the shocks as strong emission regions of tev photons generated by the accelerated particles ( hinton and hofmann 2009 ) .",
    "it is likely that diffusive shock acceleration also operates efficiently at magnetized shock waves with relativistic speeds .",
    "such relativistic shocks form during the interaction of relativistic supersonic and super - alfvenic outflows with the ambient ionized interstellar or intergalactic medium ( gerbig and schlickeiser 2009 ) producing anisotropic counterstream plasma distribution functions due to shock - reflected charged particles in the upstream medium ( spitkovsky 2008 , sironi and spitkovsky 2009 ) .",
    "relativistic outflows are a direct consequence of violent explosive events such as in gamma - ray burst sources ( piran 1999 ) both in the collapsar ( woosley 1993 , paczynski 1998 ) and supranova ( vietri and stella 1998 ) models , but also occur as highly collimated pulsar winds and jets of active galactic nuclei with initial bulk lorentz factors @xmath9 .",
    "the transport and acceleration of energetic particles in the partially turbulent cosmic magnetic fields associated with shocks is described using the equation for the particle distribution function ( for a recent derivation , see schlickeiser 2011 ) .",
    "the diffusion approximation for the particle density in the rest frame of the fluid is a well - known simplied form of the equation , which results when turbulent pitch - angle scattering is strong enough to ensure that the scale of the particle density variation is signicantly greater than the particle mean free path ( jokipii 1966 , hasselmann and wibberenz 1968 , earl 1974 ) .",
    "numerical studies confirmed the accuracy of the diffusion approximation in a uniform mean guide magnetic field ( kota et al .",
    "1982 ) .    while for nonrelativistic shock waves the analytic theory of diffusive shock acceleration is well developed ( axford et al . 1977 , krymsky 1987 , blandford and ostriker 1978 , bell 1978 , drury 1983 ) , for relativistic shock speeds such an analytical theory does not exist sofar even for parallel shock waves , although the underlying transport equation ( see eq .",

    "it is the purpose of this manuscript to develop an analytical study of acceleration in parallel relativistic magnetized shock waves employing the diffusion approximation in the upstream and downstream regions of the shock wave .",
    "the development runs much in parallel with the existing work on nonrelativistic shocks .",
    "magnetized space plasmas such as the interstellar medium harbour low - frequency linear ( @xmath10 ) transverse mhd waves ( such as shear alfven and magnetosonic plasma waves ) with dispersion relations @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , in the rest frame of the moving plasma .",

    "accordingly , the anisotropy , defined as the deviation    g(,v,,t)=f_0 ( , p , , t)-f(,p , t ) , [ a1 ] then is small ( @xmath20 ) with respect to @xmath21 .",
    "the diffusion approximation applied to the transport equation for @xmath18 allows us to relate the anisotropy @xmath22 to the solutions of the diffusion - convection tranport equation for @xmath21 .    because of the gyrorotation of the particles in the uniform magnetic field , one is not so much interested in their actual position as in the coordinates of the guiding center    = ( x , y , z)=+cq_ab_0 ^ 2_0= + cq_ab_0    p_y + -p_x + 0    , [ a2 ] where we orient the large - scale guide magnetic field , which is uniform on the scales of the particles gyradii @xmath23 , @xmath24 along the @xmath25-axis .",
