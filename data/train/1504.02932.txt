    "gaia is a space observatory of the european space agency ( esa ) , performing high precision astrometry , multi - colour , multi - epoch photometry and spectroscopy on astronomical objects brighter than @xmath15 g magnitudes .",
    "this satellite , surveying the throughout sky , will observe each object @xmath16 times averagely during five years of its lifetime @xcite .",
    "the astrometric precision of gaia depends strongly on the source magnitude and will be @xmath17as to @xmath18as for a single astrometric measurement of stars with magnitude @xmath19 to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "different astronomical phenomena could be observed during the gaia mission , e.g. supernovae @xcite , novae , dwarf novae , eruptive stars , variable stars @xcite , astrometric microlensing events @xcite , etc .",
    "here , we study some features of detecting the last one with gaia .    if the light of a background star passes through the gravitation field of a collinear foreground object , according to the einstein general relativity , the light beam bends toward the center of gravity @xcite .",
    "consequently , several distorted , ( un)magnified images are produced whose angular separations are too small to be resolved even by modern telescopes .",
    "instead , the combined and magnified light of images is received by observer , so - called gravitational microlensing .",
    "one of its feature is the displacement between the light centroid of images and the source position while the source star is passing the gravitational field of lens , i.e. astrometric trajectory @xcite . during a microlensing event by measuring the astrometric lensing and parallax effect ,",
    "the mass of the deflector can be inferred @xcite . in microlensing events ,",
    "the astrometric cross - section is much larger than the photometric one @xcite .",
    "hence , the optical depth of astrometric microlensing events is larger than the photometric one @xcite .    detecting the astrometric microlensing with the gaia satellite",
    "was first discussed by dominik & sahu ( 2000 ) .",
    "then , belokurov and evans ( 2002 ) studied this subject by more details.the astrometric microlensing due to massive objects in solar orbit beyond the kuiper belt was investigated by gaudi and bloom ( 2005 ) . also , proft et al .",
    "( 2011 ) investigated several catalogs to find several nearby stars with large proper motions which are potential candidates for the astrometric microlensing detection in the gaia era .    here",
    ", we investigate quantitatively the gaia efficiency for specifying the _ binarity fractions of microlenses _ in binary astrometric microlensing due to massive stellar populations , i.e. stellar - mass black holes , neutron stars and white dwarfs in addition to main - sequence stars . in order to obtain the gaia efficiency , we preform a monte carlo simulation .",
    "then , we evaluate the optical depth and the number of binary events being observed with gaia with detectable binary signatures , considering different binary fractions for massive stellar populations . indicating the binary fractions in massive stellar populations is useful for studying the gravitational waves and estimating their amounts , see e.g. riles ( 2013 ) , cutler and thorne ( 2002 ) .",
    "we find that gaia can potentially point out the binary fractions of massive stellar populations .",
    "furthermore , we estimate the gaia efficiency for measuring the mass of _ massive _ stellar populations in the galactic disk through astrometric microlensing of a single lens to indicate if gaia can give any information about their mass distributions . indeed",
    ", astrometric microlensing events due to more massive microlenses have longer einstein crossing times and larger angular einstein radii .",
    "therefore , the gaia efficiency for measuring the lens mass in these events is high .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ( [ one ] ) the basics of astrometric microlensing are explained . in the next section ,",
    "we simulate binary astrometric microlensing events being observed with gaia to investigate how much information gaia gives us about the binary stellar populations in the galactic disk . in section (",
    "[ three ] ) we study if gaia can determine the mass distributions of massive stellar populations through detecting astrometric microlensing of a single lens .",
    "we conclude in the last section .",
    "in microlensing events , the light centroid vector of source star images does not coincide with the source position .",
    "this astrometric shift in source star position changes with time as a microlensing event progresses . for a point - mass lens , the centroid shift vector of source star images is given by @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the position and magnification factor of @xmath24th image",

    "the lens mass can be inferred .",
    "nearby lenses have considerable and measurable relative parallaxes and the angular einstein radii which are suitable candidates for astrometric measurements with gaia . in that case , if the lens mass is high , the error bars of the lenses mass strongly decrease due to their large angular einstein radii .    in astrometric microlensing",

    "but , we can discern the type of microlenses with the masses in the common ranges ( belong to two populations ) through their color and magnitude . because , these microlenses most likely locate at the distance less than @xmath251 kilo parsec from the observer .    in order to study the dependance of efficiency on the parameters of the model , in figure ( [ fig5 ] ) we plot the normalized efficiencies , i.e. @xmath252 , for detecting high - quality events due to stellar - mass black holes ( black solid line ) , neutron stars ( red dashed line ) , white dwarfs ( green dotted line ) and main - sequence stars ( blue dot - dashed line ) in terms of the relevant parameters of the lens and source . to compare the efficiency curves with each other ,",
    "we normalize all efficiency curves to one which means the area under each curve is one , hence we name them as _ normalized efficiency curves_. since the area under each efficiency curve is proportional to the related value reported in the ninth column of table ( [ tab1 ] ) i.e. @xmath66 , the normalization is done by dividing y values to @xmath66 . generally , the behaviors of efficiency for different stellar populations are similar , although some differences exist in the slope of curves , peak position , etc .",
    "the normalized efficiency function in terms of the lens and source parameters is given as follows :    \\(i ) the first one is the impact parameter , @xmath253 .",
    "the efficiency of detecting high - quality events is high for astrometric microlensing events with @xmath254 for which the photometric microlensing can be observed as well as the astrometric one .",
    "\\(ii ) the second parameter is the relative velocity of source with respect to lens , @xmath44 . the efficiency increases with decreasing the relative velocity .",
    "indeed , the einstein crossing time rises with decreasing the relative velocity .",
    "since the gaia cadence is almost constant for all events towards the galactic bulge , so the number of observational data for long - duration microlensing events ( over the astrometric trajectories and photometric light curves ) is high . as a result ,",
    "the errors in parameters for these events are smaller than those due to short - duration ones .",
    "\\(iii ) and ( iv ) two next parameters : @xmath71 the mass and @xmath255 apparent magnitude of source star .",
    "the gaia astrometric precision depends strongly on the source magnitude and increases with decreasing it .",
    "hence , the gaia efficiency for measuring the lens mass in astrometric microlensing due to brighter and heavier sources is higher than that due to fainter and less massive ones .",
    "\\(v ) the next parameter is the normalized lens mass , @xmath33 .",
    "since the mass range for all stellar population is not similar , we normalize the lens mass for each stellar population to its maximum amount so that the range of the normalized lens mass for all populations is in the range of @xmath256 $ ] .",
    "for the massive lenses the einstein crossing time is long .",
    "consequently , the number of data over the astrometric trajectory and photometric light curve increases . on the other hand ,",
    "their angular einstein radius and astrometric signal are high .",
    "therefore , the gaia efficiency for measuring the mass of more massive lenses is higher than that of less massive lenses .",
    "\\(vi ) the next parameter is the corresponding time to the closest approach , @xmath28 .",
    "we uniformly choose @xmath28 in the range of @xmath257t$ ] .",
    "but the events with @xmath258 has the maximum efficiency . because , for these events the number of observational data over the astrometric trajectory and light curve is maximum .",
    "\\(vii ) and ( viii ) two last parameters : @xmath95 the relative distance of the lens to the source star from the observer and @xmath37 the source distance from observer .",
    "indeed there are two kinds of suitable sources for the gaia detection : ( a ) nearby sources with @xmath259 and ( b ) the bright sources often located at the galactic disk . correspondingly , there are two peaks in the efficiency diagram versus @xmath37 .",
    "these two classes have the different @xmath260s . we know that the einstein crossing time is proportional to @xmath261 , but the relative parallax and the angular einstein radius depend on these parameters as @xmath262 . although , the efficiency enhances with increasing each of them , but the first is an increasing function versus @xmath260 and @xmath37 and the others are decreasing functions .",
    "therefore , the efficiency is maximized for the first class when @xmath263 $ ] and for the second class when @xmath264 .    according to the dependance of efficiency on the parameters",
    ", we expect that most high - quality events have long einstein crossing times or small impact parameters or their source is a bright star . hence , most sources are so close to the observer .",
    "+    we also investigate the dependence of the gaia ( normalized ) efficiency on the galactic latitude , shown in the top panel of figure ( [ fign ] ) .",
    "the normalized efficiency decreases very slowly by increasing the distance from the galactic plane . because , there are two effects act reversely : ( i ) the extinction toward the galactic bulge strongly increases by decreasing the distance from the galactic plane as shown in the bottom panel of figure ( [ fign ] ) and ( ii ) the galactic disk density , equation ( [ rhod ] ) , decreases by increasing distance from the galactic plane .",
    "the first effect decreases the probability of finding a source star brighter than 20-g magnitude toward the galactic center while the abundance of stars is maximum in this direction .",
    "consequently , the efficiency is almost constant over the galactic bulge . to determine the extinction",
    ", we average over the amounts of the extinction due to the galactic longitudes in the range of @xmath190^{\\circ}$ ] for each value of @xmath92 .",
    "one of astronomical phenomena being observed with gaia is astrometric microlensing events . in this work",
    ", we investigated whether gaia can specify the binary fractions and mass distributions of massive stellar populations through astrometric microlensing .",
    "we simulated binary astrometric microlensing events being observed with gaia due to binary stellar - mass black holes , binary neutron stars , binary white dwarfs and binary main - sequence stars to evaluate the efficiency for detecting the binary signatures .",
    "we considered @xmath265 as the detectability criterion and concluded that gaia detects the signal from the second lens with probability @xmath266 per cent .",
    "then , we estimated the number of binary astrometric microlensing due to the mentioned populations with detectable binary signals in the gaia era as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively ( @xmath267 ) . hence , gaia can potentially determine the binary fraction of massive stellar populations . since the predicted number of binary astrometric microlensing events of stellar - mass black holes is small ,",
    "so the gaia accuracy to specify their binary fraction is low .",
    "the significant points is that binary systems composed of white dwarfs , neutron stars or black holes are sources of detectable gravitational waves .",
    "therefore , indicating the binary fraction of these massive stellar populations helps to assess the amount of the gravitational waves .    also , we investigated the gaia efficiency for measuring the mass of massive stellar populations in the galactic disk , i.e. stellar - mass black holes , neutron stars and white dwarfs in addition to main - sequence stars as microlenses in astrometric microlensing events of single lenses .",
    "the gaia efficiency for measuring the mass of microlenses enhances with increasing the lens mass . by performing monte carlo simulation",
    ", we concluded that the gaia efficiencies for detecting high - quality events due to these stellar populations are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 per cent respectively .",
    "we estimated the number of high - quality events for these populations as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "hence , gaia can obtain some information about their masses and mass distribution of these massive stellar populations .",
    "i am grateful to sohrab rahvar for helpful discussions and comments and scott gaudi for careful reading and commenting on the manuscript .",
    "i thank anonymous referee for useful comments and suggestions which certainly improved the manuscript .",
    "also , i acknowledge the use of the legacy archive for microwave background data analysis ( lambda ) , part of the high energy astrophysics science archive center ( heasarc ) ."
