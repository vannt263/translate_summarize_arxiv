    "is often referred to as photo - assisted transport @xcite . in the absence of an ac bias , most treatments of molecular wire junctions focus on the problem of stationary current and conductance . on the other hand , the problem of ac - stm requires an explicit time - dependent approach that allows a full description of the transient terms , as well as the stationary terms . in this regard a hamiltonian formulation of transport such as",

    "the connection between the _ molecule _ and the substrate is assumed to be quite strong .",
    "indeed , such strong binding to a substrate is known to occur when the _ molecule _ is functionalized : when for instance an end group of atoms in the _ molecule _ is replaced by a sulphur atom , which has strong binding properties on a gold substrate .",

    "the relative importance of odd and even photon peaks can be traced to a high sensitivity of the noise with respect to the ac bias amplitude @xmath75 , due to the oscillations of the bessel functions ( see eq .  ( [ noise_derivative_1dot ] ) ) .",

    "first , notice that the noise does not display steps any more .",
    "qualitatively , it is understood that current flows when the absolute value of the bias is large compared to the the `` photon energy '' @xmath69 : in this situation there is no balance between carriers emmitted from the tip to the substrate , and vice versa .",

    "more interesting is the reduction of the noise observed when @xmath78 .",
    "current can flow with the help of virtual transitions through the dot , but for this ac bias where essentially only single photon transitions contribute , there is an additional channel which brings about noise reduction .",
    "this explains the two side dips in the noise at @xmath78 in fig .",

    "further increasing the coupling to the substrates gives rises to monotonous steps which resemble the noise characteristic of a single dot with a sharp level .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "as long as the substrate coupling @xmath67 is smaller than the hopping between the two sites of the _ molecule _ , increasing @xmath67 smoothes out the photo  assisted shot noise .",
    "but for @xmath88 , the system behaves as if it was a single dot ( the dot closest to the tip ) .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by comparing the density of states of the double dots / single dot case ( eq .",
