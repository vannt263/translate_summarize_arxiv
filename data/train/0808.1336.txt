    "as pointed out by sakharov @xcite in the 60 s , one of the necessary conditions for the observed universe is cp violation in physical processes . in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , the only source of cp violation is given by the so - called kobayashi - maskawa mechanism @xcite in the quark sector . in weak transitions , the up - type quarks and the down - type quarks",
    "are coupled through the @xmath5 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite , which contains a cp - violating phase .",
    "therefore , studying and understanding the origin of such a phase in the sm is crucial to particle physics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "more importantly , it is possible to shed some light on new physics in such studies .    due to its hierarchical structure ,",
    "the ckm matrix has one useful unitarity condition , which connects its first and third column : @xmath6 this relation has a special status because it renders on a complex plane a triangle that has all sides about the same size ( and so are the angles ) .",
    "an important program of current @xmath0-factories is to use various processes to overconstrain this unitarity triangle ( ut ) .",
    "through such an exercise , we hope not only to measure precisely the sides and angles of the ut but also to obtain hints of physics beyond the sm that provides additional cp - violating sources .",
    "the indirect cp violation in the @xmath0 system has been first established in the charmonium modes in 2001 , and is now measured at a precision better than @xmath7 . soon after that first measurement , the direct cp violation in the @xmath0 system has also been observed in the @xmath8 decay mode in 2004 .",
    "this is a result of the interference between color - allowed tree and qcd penguin amplitudes . in the following , we concentrate exclusively on the direct cp asymmetries in rare",
    "@xmath0 decays .",
    "among all processes , charmless two - body hadronic @xmath0 decays are often sensitive to the @xmath9 and @xmath10 matrix elements that involve cp - violating phases through @xmath0-@xmath11 mixing and/or decay amplitudes . with increasing precision on their branching ratios and cp asymmetries ,",
    "these rare decay modes provide additional useful constraints on the ut .",
    "consider the decay of a @xmath0 meson into some final state @xmath12 and its cp - conjugated one .",
    "assuming the process involves two amplitudes , one has @xmath13 and @xmath14 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : amps ] ) and ( [ eq : acp ] ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote respectively the relative strong and weak phases between the two amplitudes .",
    "therefore , observing a sizable cp asymmetry in the decays requires the interference of at least two amplitudes with large relative strong and weak phases .",
    "currently , information of direct cp asymmetries in hadronic @xmath0 decays is collected by the babar , belle , cleo , cdf and d collaborations . in table  [ tab : dcpv ] , we list the asymmetries that deviate from zero at more than @xmath17 level .",
    ".direct cp asymmetries of rare @xmath0 decays measured at the @xmath17 level or more , all quoted from ref .",
    "[ tab : dcpv ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as shown in table  [ tab : rhok ] , the cp asymmetries of all the listed modes are consistent with zero . in particular , the two neutral @xmath0 decays imply that the strong phases between the color - allowed tree and qcd penguin amplitudes are trivial .",
    "we consider the following four quantities : @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the corresponding relative strong phases . instead of treating @xmath23 and @xmath24 as independent parameters , one may employ the factorization assumption to obtain @xmath25 where the uncertainty mainly comes from the form factors . in this case , there are now only four parameters for the four observables in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fourobs ] ) . solving them",
    "gives @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "this result is consistent with other methods @xcite .",
    "we review the importance of cp asymmetries in @xmath0 meson decays .",
    "the flavor su(3 ) symmetry assumption is employed to analyze charmless two - body modes in a global way .",
    "the direct cp asymmetries provide useful information on both weak and strong phases . currently , there are six direct cp asymmetry observables deviating from zero at @xmath17 level or more . sizable relative sizes and strong phases",
    "are observed between the color - allowed and color - suppressed tree amplitudes from current data .",
    "the puzzle in the cp asymmetry pattern of @xmath30 decays can be explained by such a color - suppressed amplitude or some new physics effects with a new weak phase in the electroweak penguin amplitude .",
    "the large color - suppressed amplitude explanation requires better understanding of the strong dynamics .",
    "the same comment applies to the singlet penguin amplitudes too .",
    "we examine the flavor symmetry principle by scrutinizing a set of @xmath31 decays .",
    "current data indicate unexpectedly large su(3 ) breaking in the strong phases .",
    "this may eventually go away if @xmath32 turns out to be @xmath33 larger or the symmetry breaking in amplitude sizes is @xmath34 larger .",
    "a definite conclusion on this issue relies on more precise experimental measurements .",
    "in addition to the @xmath35 modes , it is useful to constrain @xmath2 using charmless decay modes as well .",
    "the rates and cp asymmetries of some @xmath36 and @xmath4 modes can be used to determine @xmath2 with only a mild assumption of factorization for the tree amplitudes .",
