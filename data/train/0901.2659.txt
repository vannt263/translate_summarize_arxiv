    "the random field ising model ( rfim ) is one of the most studied systems in magnetism ( for reviews , see @xcite and more recently @xcite ) .",
    "its simple theoretical definition and the interesting physical properties that emerge from its study represent two great motivations for the investigation of this model .",
    "in addition , a considerable experimental interest arised after the identification of the rfim with some diluted antiferromagnets in the presence of a uniform magnetic field @xcite , like @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .    following the success of the ising model to capture the essential physics of complex systems , several lattice models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these models involve a periodic lattice whose sities are occupied by spin-@xmath10 variables with two states , @xmath11 .",
    "every configuration , @xmath12 , has a potential energy given by the ising hamiltonian , @xmath13 i.e. , any pair of nearest - neighbors spins contributes with a random exchange interaction @xmath14 and each spin interacts also with a magnetic field of local intensity @xmath15 .",
    "systems based on eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) are called models of _ quenched _ disorder ( mqd ) @xcite .",
    "they are characterized by a frozen - in spatial distribution of disorder , i.e. , @xmath14 and/or @xmath15 vary at random with @xmath16 but remains fixed with time .",
    "these models have been very well explored in the literature @xcite , and some experimental results can theoretically be reproduced even at mean - field level @xcite .",
    "however , mqd are _ equilibrium _ models , and they neglect diffusion of magnetically active ions that occurs in some systems , like spin glasses @xcite . diffusion constantly modifies the distance between each specific pair of spin ions in substances and , consequently , one should probably allow for variations both in space and time of @xmath14 and/or @xmath15 in a model .",
    "these effects do not seem to be correctly described by _ annealed _",
    "systems , where the change with time of the spatial distribution of @xmath14 and/or @xmath15 is constrained by the need to reach equilibrium with the other degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "therefore , impurities tend to be strongly correlated , which is not observed in most substances . instead",
    ", one may conceive a situation in which both @xmath17 and the spatial distribution of impurities @xmath14 , or the spatial distribution of the local fields @xmath15 , vary with time .",
    "that is , one may assume that spins and impurities ( or fields ) behave more independently of each other than in the annealed model so that a conflict occurs , and a steady _ nonequilibrium _ condition prevails asymptotically .",
    "this is consistent with the reported observation of nonequilibrium effects , for exemple , the influence of the details of the dynamical process on the steady state in some materials @xcite .",
    "these models can be called nonequilibrium random - field ising models ( nrfim )    the study of nonequilibrium models defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) reveals many interesting features @xcite , with a rich variety of phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "exact results obtained for one - dimensional lattices @xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite reveal that the critical behavior is non - universal , but it generally depends on apparently irrelevant details of dynamics , like diffusion of impurities , i.e. , the properties of the distribution of the random variables , and on the transition rates chosen .",
    "the probability distributions analyzed were discrete , for random exchange interactions and/or random magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "as experimental realizations of these systems , we may imagine : i ) a magnetic material under the action of a random ( or very rapidly fluctuating ) magnetic field , i.e. , a field that varies according to a given probability distribution with a period shorter than the mean time between successive transitions that modify the spin configuration , or ii ) a disordered system with fast and random diffusion of impurities in which the latter consist of both exchanges as in spin glasses and local fields as in random field systems @xcite .    due to these motivations , we have studied the nrfim on a square lattice with nearest - neighbors interactions and in the presence of random magnetic fields that follow a double - gaussian probability distribution .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations and our results suggest that first - order phase transitions occur in the model for some values of @xmath18 at low temperatures and high random - field intensities . in the low - field region , we have performed a finite size scaling ( fss ) to estimate the critical exponents , in order to test whether the system follows continuous fss laws .",
    "a simple realization of the ideas discussed in the introduction is the kinetic ising model @xcite , where the spin system is in contact with a heat bath at temperature @xmath19 that induces stochastic changes of @xmath17 according the master equation @xcite @xmath20.\\ ] ] here , @xmath21 is the probability of any configuration @xmath17 at time @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the probability per unit time for a transition from @xmath17 to @xmath24 ; the latter is obtained from @xmath17 by flipping spin @xmath25 .",
    "the detailed balance condition , i.e. , @xmath26 $ ] , with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the inverse temperature ( @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant ) , is sufficient to guarantee that the stationary solution of eq . ( [ eq2 ] ) is the gibbs state corresponding to energy given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and temperature @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this is satisfied by the metropolis algorithm @xcite , @xmath30 , for instance @xcite .",
    "we have considered the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) on a square lattice of linear dimension @xmath31 and constant exchange interaction , i.e. , @xmath32 . in other words ,",
    "@xmath33 and the random fields @xmath34 follow a continuous probability distribution , namely , the double - gaussian one , @xmath35 + \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(h_{i}+h_{o})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right]\\right\\},\\ ] ] where we have two gaussian distributions centered at @xmath36 with the same width @xmath3 .",
    "the time evolution of any state @xmath17 is generated by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) with @xmath37 describing a competing process @xcite . for the numerical implementation ,",
    "the algorithm is as follows : at each time step , a new configuration of random fields @xmath34 is generated according to @xmath38 , eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) ; then , every lattice site is visited , and a spin flip occurs according to metropolis rule . in other words , the random variables @xmath15 vary with time , i.e. , the system is described at each time by eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , with @xmath15 distributed according to @xmath38 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the _ instantaneous _ hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) , corresponds to the one that characterizes the quenched rfim .",
    "however , the local fields also change at random with time at each site according to @xmath38 .",
    "consequently , a sort of dynamic conflict occurs , which differs fundamentally from the _ equilibrium _ quenched and annealed random - field models , and we have a _ nonequilibrium _ system @xcite .",
    "we may interpret this as a magnet under a field that is changing ( all over system ) at random with time according to @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "thus , we have two different characteristic time scales : one for the fluctuations of the spins and another one for the fluctuations of the random field , and we consider that these two fluctuations are independent ( a formal discussion about this is found in ref .",
    "@xcite , chapter 7 ) .",
    "we will show that this rapid fluctuation of the random variables @xmath15 during the time evolution of the system lead to a first - order transition between the ordered and the disordered phases for high values of the random - field intensity @xmath7 , in opposition of the continuous transition that was found for small @xmath7 .    although we do not have evidences that the double - gaussian distribution for the random fields can be realized experimentally , we can argue that this distribution is suitable for an appropriate theoretical description of random - field models @xcite . in the identification of the rfim with diluted antiferromagnets in the presence of a uniform magnetic field ,",
    "the local random fields are expressed in terms of quantities that vary in both signal and magnitude @xcite .",
    "this characteristic rules out the bimodal probability distribution from a such class of physical systems .",
    "although the rfim defined in terms of a single gaussian probability distribution is physically acceptable , it usually leads only to continuous phase transitions , either within mean - field @xcite , or standard short - range - interaction approaches @xcite .",
    "this discussion is based on quenched random - field models , but an extension to the case of nonequilibrium diluted antiferromagnets was discussed by some authors @xcite . as pointed in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", the double - gaussian distribution can recover in appropriate limits the bimodal distribution ( @xmath4 ) and the single gaussian one ( @xmath39 or @xmath40 ) . in fig.[fig1 ] , we show two histograms of the random variables @xmath34 generated numerically accordingly the probability distribution of eq .",

    "<S> the effects of locally random magnetic fields are considered in a nonequilibrium ising model defined on a square lattice with nearest - neighbors interactions . in order to generate the random magnetic fields , we have considered random variables @xmath0 that change randomly with time according to a double - gaussian probability distribution , which consists of two single gaussian distributions , centered at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with the same width @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution is very general , and can recover in appropriate limits the bimodal distribution ( @xmath4 ) and the single gaussian one ( @xmath5 ) </S>",
    "<S> . we performed monte carlo simulations in lattices with linear sizes in the range @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the system exhibits ferromagnetic and paramagnetic steady states . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest the occurence of first - order phase transitions between the above - mentioned phases at low temperatures and large random - field intensities @xmath7 , for some small values of the width @xmath3 . by means of finite size scaling </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the critical exponents in the low - field region , where we have continuous phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show a sketch of the phase diagram of the model for some values of @xmath3 . </S>"
