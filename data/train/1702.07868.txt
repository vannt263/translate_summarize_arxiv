    "the passive particle transport in a 2d incompressible flow with prescribed vorticity is a research topic of the highest relevance in fluid dynamics @xcite . in the lagrangian formulation ,",

    ", we consider the dynamics induced in an ideal flow confined in a circular domain of radius @xmath0 under the action of a prescribed @xmath1-periodic vortex path .",
    "this problem is classical in the literature ( see for instance @xcite ) and can be seen as a 2d idealization of the mixing of a fluid in a cylindrical tank .",

    "it is useful to see @xmath8 as a complex variable , then the corresponding hamiltonian system is @xmath9 where the asterisk means the complex conjugate .    in the related literature",
    ", @xmath10 is called the _ stirring protocol_. when it is constant , then @xmath11 is a conserved quantity and all the particles rotate around the vortex in circular trajectories .",
    "when @xmath10 is time - dependent , then the hamiltonian ceases to be a conserved quantity and the analysis is more delicate . in @xcite",
    ", it is proved that any smooth stirring protocol @xmath10 induces an infinite number of periodic trajectories rotating around the vortex ( non - zero winding number ) .",
    "hence , it is a natural question to try to identify the stirring protocols that generate periodic trajectories with zero winding number , that is , particles moving periodically but not rotating around the vortex .",
    "this question was posed explicitly as an open problem in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.3 ) .",
    "our intention is to advance on the comprehension of this difficult problem by analyzing the family of circular protocols @xmath12 . in this case , the change to a corotating frame @xmath13 transforms into the autonomous system @xmath14 the hamiltonian structure is preserved , so the streamlines are just the level curves of corresponding hamiltonian , which is indeed a conserved quantity .",
    "this fact enables a complete bifurcation analysis of the relative equilibria , performed in section [ sec2 ] , which correspond to periodic solutions of zero winding number for the original system .",

    "let us prove now the remaining cases of the result .",

    "similarly as before , system has a critical point at @xmath89 inside the disk of radius @xmath0 if and only if is satisfied .",
    "notice that , since @xmath65 , in this case @xmath108 varies from zero to @xmath163 .",
    "thus , on account of @xmath164 , if @xmath165 stays above of the maxima of @xmath104 inside @xmath166 then @xmath110 has a unique zero which is larger than @xmath0 .",

    "it only remains to prove the stability of such critical points .",
