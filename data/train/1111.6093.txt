    "the properties of topological superconductors and superfluids have attracted a considerable interest recently .",
    "the defining feature of these systems is that , while the fermionic excitations in the bulk are fully gapped , nontrivial topology of the order parameter manifests itself in the existence of gapless quasiparticles localized near the order parameter inhomogeneities , such as abrikosov vortices , domain walls , or the sample boundaries .",
    "one of the most studied examples is the chiral @xmath0-wave spin - triplet state , whose experimental realizations include the superconducting state of sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 ( ref . ) or thin films of superfluid @xmath4he-@xmath5 ( ref . ) .",
    "the chiral @xmath0-wave state in fermionic superfluids is closely related to the moore - read pfaffian quantum hall state.@xcite    the momentum - space order parameter of a chiral @xmath0-wave superconductor is proportional to @xmath1 . in the absence of external magnetic field , it is two - fold degenerate : the states @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which are obtained from each other by time reversal , have the same energy",
    ". therefore , superconducting states with opposite chiralities separated by domain walls ( dw ) might form in different parts of the system . indeed , there is evidence of the dw existence in sr@xmath2ruo@xmath3 ( refs . and ) and also in slabs of superfluid @xmath4he ( ref . ) .",
    "the dw formation costs gradient energy due to the spatial variation of the order parameter .",
    "in contrast to ferromagnets , which break up into domains in order to minimize the net magnetic moment , there is no similarly compelling energy reason in a neutral superfluid .",
    "one possible mechanism is that domains are spontaneously formed upon cooling across the phase transition due to the sample inhomogeneity . alternatively ,",
    "an increase in the gradient energy might be compensated by the creation of low - energy quasiparticles bound to the dw , which is particularly effective in one - dimensional systems.@xcite    while the static properties of the dws in various realizations of the chiral @xmath0-wave state have been extensively studied,@xcite their dynamics has received comparatively little theoretical attention , see ref . .",
    "the motion of a different type of planar defects , namely , an interface between the @xmath5 and @xmath8 phases of superfluid @xmath4he was studied in refs . and , where it was pointed out that the scattering of bogoliubov quasiparticles by the moving interface results in an effective friction force .",
    "similar ideas can be applied in our case as well .",
    "the dw , which is assumed to be moving uniformly as a whole , suffers viscous friction and acquires mass due to its interaction with fermionic quasiparticles , see sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . to obtain the dw dynamic characteristics we employ the effective bosonic action formalism , see sec .",
    "[ sec : s - eff derivation ] .",

    "although some bits and pieces about the properties of the dw quasiparticle spectrum can be found scattered in the literature , we believe it is useful to present a complete picture in one place .",

    "we assume that the band dispersion is isotropic : @xmath15 , with the effective mass @xmath16 ( our results can be straightforwardly generalized for the case of anisotropic dispersion ) .",
    "we also neglect disorder , as well as the effects related to the electric charges , such as the meissner screening of the external or internal magnetic fields .    for a static dw",
    ", one can choose the @xmath17-axis along the normal and write the order parameter as @xmath18 where the amplitudes of the components , the relative phase @xmath19 , and the common phase @xmath20 all depend on @xmath17 .",
    "assuming that the most stable superconducting state in the bulk is described by one of the two degenerate chiral states @xmath21 and allowing for a nonzero phase difference between the two domains , we have the following expression for the order parameter asymptotics far from the dw : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is a parameter which depends on the microscopic details ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "its value is fixed by the condition of vanishing supercurrent across the dw , see a discussion of this point in appendix [ sec : gl description ] .",
    "an exact analytical expression for the dw structure is not available and a variety of approximations have been proposed in the literature .",
    "for instance , the amplitudes of both components can be put constant : @xmath25 ( ref . ) .",
    "alternatively , one can assume constant phases : @xmath26 or @xmath27 , where a real function @xmath28 varies between @xmath29 at @xmath30 and @xmath31 at @xmath32 ( refs . , and ) .",

    "( [ dw - model ] ) is not important for our purposes .",
    "we are interested in the motion of the dw as a whole .",
    "such a motion can be caused , for instance , by the ( extremely weak ) interaction of an external magnetic field with the orbital moment of the cooper pairs.@xcite the direction of the latter is given by the unit vector @xmath44 , which takes opposite values in the two domains [ according to eq .",

    "one can express linear - response kinetic coefficients , in particular , the dw viscous friction , in terms of the equilibrium fluctuation properties .",
    "it is legitimate , therefore , to use the matsubara formalism with the magnetic field and the driving force both set to zero . in the absence of external field ,",
    "the controversy about the magnitude of the orbital moment and the lack of its local definition , see refs . , and , is not relevant for our problem .    in the bosonic effective action",

    "its motion induces transitions between the quasiparticle states , which result in the effective dw friction and inertia .",
    "if the leading term in the frequency expansion of the kernel @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 , then @xmath58 can be interpreted , in the spirit of the caldeira - leggett model,@xcite as the viscous friction coefficient , while a term quadratic in @xmath59 yields the inertial mass of the dw .",
    "the frequency is assumed to be small compared to the gap amplitude , so that the dw order parameter profile is not deformed during its motion .",
    "note that there are different ways to define the effective mass of a topological defect in superconductor and superfluids , discussed mostly in the context of the abrikosov vortex dynamics , see ref . .",
