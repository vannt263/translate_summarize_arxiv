    "andreev and thurston s work together gave a complete characterization of the space of the classical combinatorial gauss curvature .",
    "as a corollary , they got the combinatorial - topological obstacle for the existence of a constant curvature circle packing metric , which could be written as combinatorial - topological inequalities .",
    "chow and luo @xcite first introduced a combinatorial ricci flow , a combinatorial analogue of the smooth surface ricci flow , for triangulated surfaces with thurston s circle packing metrics and got the equivalence between the existence of a constant curvature metric and the convergence of the combinatorial ricci flow .",
