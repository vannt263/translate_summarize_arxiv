    "knowledge of the physical mechanism of diffusion is essential to an understanding of the dynamical complexities of supercooled liquids .",

    "if so , distributions of barrier heights , reaction coordinates for barrier crossing , and details of the relevant saddle - barriers are significant .",
    "valuable information is encoded in the @xmath0-dependence of the self diffusion coefficient @xmath12 and of the viscosity @xmath16 ( the stokes - einstein law , @xmath17 , holds until very close to the glass transition at @xmath18 ) . for most normal liquids",
    "@xmath12 exhibits arrhenius @xmath0-dependence . in @xcite",
    "strong liquids this continues all the way down to @xmath18 , while super - arrhenius , with the apparent activation energy @xmath19 increasing with decreasing @xmath0 , sets in before @xmath18 in @xcite fragile liquids .",
    "some exceptions classified as weak by kivelson et .",
    "al @xcite , including simple atomic models such as lennard - jones ( lj ) , show a normal or upper - supercooled range of power - law @xmath20 .",
    "clearly the mechanism of diffusion is @xmath0-dependent , and a straightforward conclusion is that activated potential - energy barrier crossing , or _ hopping _ , plays an important role .",
    "in contrast to chemical reactions where the arrhenius law was first introduced , however , the barriers and reaction coordinates for diffusion have proved elusive . to further complicate matters , free energy or entropic barriers , associated with the difficulty of finding a low - energy pathway ,",
    "may also be important .",
    "it is not straightforward to infer a mechanism from @xmath20 , and thus there has been considerable speculation .",
    "adam and gibbs suggested @xcite that liquids may be decomposed into roughly independent _ cooperatively rearranging regions _",
    "( crr ) containing @xmath21 particles , with super - arrhenius arising from the growth of the crr , and thus the activation free energy , with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "an influential paper by goldstein @xcite formulated dynamics in terms of the @xmath22-dimensional potential energy @xmath23-surface , or _",
    "landscape_. he proposed the existence of distinct high and low-@xmath0 dynamical regimes , separated by a crossover temperature . at low @xmath0",
    "the system stays for times long compared to a vibrational period in the basins associated with the local minima of the landscape , and diffusion is governed by infrequent hopping of the saddle - barriers connecting adjoining basins .",
    "perhaps the rearrangements of the crr correspond to reaction coordinates on the landscape . at high-@xmath0 a different , freer motion is presumed to occur .",
    "the onset of the low-@xmath0 mechanism is sometimes described as a transition to hopping , but if the high-@xmath0 diffusion constant is arrhenius , implying activation , the change must be more subtle .",
    "the idea of a crossover is central to current thinking about supercooled liquids .",
    "we will pursue the landscape point of view in this paper , so the mechanism of diffusion is naturally discused in terms of the topology .",
    "goldstein s picture has been extended to involve two characteristic temperatures , meaning that the mechanism changes gradually over a crossover range @xmath1 .",
    "interesting features of supercooled dynamics such as super - arrhenius and stretched exponential decay of time correlations first appear at @xmath24 @xcite and @xmath20 extrapolates to zero from above , via power - law fit , at the mode - coupling @xcite temperature @xmath25 .",
    "note that @xmath9 , defined by the extrapolation , seems a useful quantity regardless of the validity of mode - coupling theory .",
    "an alternative formulation , the @xcite frustration limited domain theory of kivelson and co - workers , introduces an upper crossover temperature @xmath26 at which collective dynamics first becomes important .",
    "still lower @xcite lie @xmath18 , the kauzmann temperature @xmath27 and the vtf @xmath28 , but this paper is concerned with temperatures from @xmath24 to somewhat under @xmath9 .",
    "it is difficult to obtain well - equilibrated computer simulation data below @xmath9 , and impossible to approach @xmath18 .",
    "stillinger and weber showed @xcite how to obtain an explicit description of motion over the landscape in a molecular dynamics simulation , by mapping a @xmath22-dimensional liquid configuration @xmath29 to the associated minimum @xmath30 , or _ inherent structure _ ( is ) , with frequent steepest - descent minimizations ( faster conjugate - gradient minimizations are equivalent @xcite at supercooled @xmath0 ) . the configuration space is thus partitioned into the basins of attraction of the is and the rate of _ inherent structure transitions _",
    "( ist ) may be measured .",
    "the is - mapping is a powerful technique for the investigation of supercooled dynamics but it has not yet been exploited to anything like its full potential .",
    "sastry et al .",
    "demonstrated @xcite in the lj mixture that the averaged is energy , @xmath31 , undergoes a sharp drop ( the @xcite slope ) from an upper high-@xmath0 to a lower low-@xmath0 plateau .",
    "they identify the beginning of the drop with @xmath24 , and @xmath9 lies near the apparent bottom .",
    "the bottom energy is cooling - rate dependent and the true value , requiring cooling slow enough to maintain equilibration , remains unknown .",
    "it is appealing , within the landscape point of view , to relate the change in dynamical mechanism to occupation by the system of lower - lying is .",
    "more direct investigations of the influence of the landscape on dynamics are possible .",
    "the minima of the squared potential gradient @xmath32 include all the extrema , or critical points , of @xmath23 , including minima of order @xmath33 and saddles of order @xmath34 .",

    "cavagna , angelani et al .",
    "@xcite showed that minima dominate below @xmath9 , saddles above .",
    "the is - mapping assigns the system to a minimum even if it is in the upper reaches of the basin near the saddle - barriers ; the critical point mapping does so only if it is actually close to the is .",
    "they suggest @xcite that the crossover is from motion among the minima ( is dynamics ) at @xmath36 to motion among the saddles ( saddle dynamics ) at @xmath37 .",
    "either mapping may be used at any @xmath0 .",
    "reference to saddle dynamics or is dynamics below indicates that it gives the simpler , more physical description .",
    "the _ saddles ruled _ @xcite regime is also one of _",
    "border dynamics_. reaction coordinates leading to several different is intersect at a multidimensional or @xcite monkey saddle , so is boundaries are closely spaced in the vicinity of a saddle .",
    "the system is always near a border , crossings are facile and frequent , and ist are not hops but merely unphysical bookkeeping @xcite events .",
    "a much better understanding of the @xmath37 region is being achieved with the new ideas about saddles and border dynamics .",
    "recently @xcite we gave the first quantitative expression for @xmath12 in terms of the ist rate @xmath38 and the mean - square separation of successive is .",
    "we argued that the long - time slope of the mean - square displacement per degree of freedom ( msd ) of the is - configuration , @xmath39 , is equal to @xmath12 , as is so for the ordinary msd , @xmath40 .",
    "the is - displacement is the sum of the ist - vectors ( separations of successive minima ) , @xmath41 after @xmath42 transitions in time @xmath7 ; for any quantity @xmath43 , the displacement @xmath44 .",
    "a key quantity in this approach is @xcite the ist - vector correlation , @xmath45 . in unit - density lj ,",
    "@xmath46 = 32 atoms , where @xmath47 ( lj units ) , an ist - markov approximation of random walking among the is , predicts @xmath12 accurately for @xmath48 and substantially overestimates @xmath12 for @xmath49 .",
    "the markov approximation is equivalent to the statement that the ist - vectors are uncorrelated , @xmath50 .",
    "our result supports the idea of long sojourns in the basins below @xmath9 , since the system then has time to lose correlation or memory between ist , leading to a random walk . because of the uniquely weak @xmath0-dependence of @xmath12 at @xmath37 in lj , transition to hopping may actually be an accurate description of the crossover in this case .",
    "the overestimate of @xmath12 by the markov approximation at @xmath37 is associated @xcite with a long ranged anticorrelation of successive transition vectors , negative @xmath51 at large @xmath52 , necessary for frequent ist to result in relatively little displacement .",
    "_ anticorrelated ist - vectors are a signature of the bookkeeping ist occuring in border dynamics . _",
    "a problem arises in trying to learn about landscape dynamics with the is - mapping . in the absence of long - range correlations",
    "the configuration space of the liquid should be regarded as a composite of the spaces of @xmath53 independent local regions of @xmath54 particles .",
    "a simple model @xcite uses 3@xmath46 sinusoidal potentials . local regions and adam - gibbs @xcite crr need not be equivalent , but we will treat them as such . with independent ist occurring in each region , and with a transition for the whole system recorded when",
    "any region changes , @xmath55 and the distribution of waiting times between ist , @xmath4 , is correspondingly @xcite , and unphysically , skewed towards short time @xmath56 .",
    "computational constraints then indicate that one should simulate the smallest realistic system ; with sufficiently large @xmath46 an ist will be observed on every time step and no meaningful calculation will be possible .",
    "more fundamentally , the desired properties are those of the crr , the building blocks of the macroscopic liquid , but straightforward simulation yields those of the homogenized composite . with increasing @xmath46",
    "the former become more difficult to disentangle from the latter .",
    "this is also true for static quantities .",
    "for example , whatever the distribution of @xmath57 in a local region , it will be gaussian for the entire system at large @xmath46 .",
    "even for the best choice of @xmath46 some new theory is required to interpret the simulation data .    in this article",
    "we further examine the @xmath0-dependent mechanism of diffusion in unit - density lj , @xmath46 = 32 , via three new landscape dynamical entities , and with an initial attempt to derive local relaxation from simulated composite dynamics .",
    "the first is @xmath58 , the msd _ with no contribution from ist_. starting in a thermal ensemble of basins , @xmath2 is calculated from only those trajectories which remain in the initial basin at time @xmath7 .",
    "the second is @xmath3 and the third is the distribution @xmath5 of waiting times in an is _ for a local region or crr_. we present a simple method to obtain @xmath5 from @xmath4 and @xmath53 , estimated from the averaged participation ratio , @xmath59 , of the ist - vectors .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom ( not particles ) participating in an ist is roughly @xmath59 ; thus @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "comparison of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath40 and @xmath5 casts considerable light upon the relation of diffusion to the landscape . for @xmath62 , where @xmath13 is a characteristic plateau time",
    ", @xmath2 attains a constant value , due to @xcite the finite volume of the basin .",
    "this is true even at high @xmath0 where the system moves freely among the is , since only trajectories which remain in the original is contribute ( thus averaging is difficult ) . at @xmath0",
    "= 1.10 the plateau is reached quickly but a small interval of linear @xmath7-dependence is visible at intermediate times , from which an _ intrabasin diffusion coefficient _ , @xmath8 , may be calculated .",
    "below @xmath63 the diffusive interval in @xmath2 expands ; @xmath24 is estimated as the top of the slope in @xmath31 .",
    "more cooling reveals that the @xmath15 regime is _ intrabasin dominated _ with @xmath11 - the true diffusion constant may be calculated in a single basin !",
    "thus , as for high @xmath0 , diffusion can not consist of a sequence of activated ist hops , but the mechanism is quite different from the high-@xmath0 mechanism .",
    "intrabasin diffusion arises from the roughness of the landscape at the upper elevations of a basin and provides a mechanism for confinement different from inter - basin barriers but nonetheless capable of producing @xcite a markov chain of ist under the right conditions .",
    "we suggest that the elementary steps in this process are transitions among the domains of the saddles connected to the is , ie , intrabasin diffusion is saddle dynamics .",
    "dominated _ diffusion is also is dynamics , since the motion among the is is then a simple random walk ; at intermediate @xmath0 both descriptions are appropriate .",
    "the system does not sense the finite size of the basin until the mean local waiting time , @xmath6 , reaches @xmath13 .",
    "we thus have a new criterion for the onset of the low-@xmath0 is - dynamics mechanism and , indeed , it is found that @xmath6 crosses @xmath13 slightly below @xmath9 .",
    "the analysis would make no sense with an @xmath46-dependent mean time taken from @xmath4 .",
    "more information is obtained by comparison of @xmath3 with @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath64 , where @xcite @xmath65 is the return vector , the separation of the system from its is . if @xmath66 and @xmath67 are uncorrelated , @xmath40 must lie above @xmath3 .",
    "this is so at low @xmath0 but as @xmath0 increases @xmath3 rises above @xmath40 .",
    "the relation of @xmath3 to @xmath40 , indicating the correlation of @xmath66 and @xmath67 , yields a _ border index _",
    "@xmath68 which complements the information contained in @xmath51 regarding is vs saddle dynamics . in sum",
    ", with some novel applications of the is- mapping we achieve an extremely detailed description of the @xmath0-dependent mechanism of diffusion .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations are performed on unit - density supercooled lj @xcite , @xmath46 = 32 , with the methods described in ref  @xcite . as discussed there , and above , a small system should be used for ist dynamics . increasing @xmath46 beyond the number required to solvate a crr merely creates an intractably large ist rate and makes it difficult to extract the properties of a crr from those of the composite landscape .",
    "is @xmath46=32 large enough ?",
    "the diffusion constants are close to those for @xcite @xmath46=108 and @xcite @xmath46 = 256 , with slightly weaker @xmath0-dependence .",
    "the crystal melts at @xmath69 and @xcite fitting @xmath20 yields @xmath47 , while at @xmath46=256 @xcite @xmath70 and ( for modified lj ) @xcite @xmath71 .",

    "the plot @xcite of @xmath31 is similar to that of ref  @xcite , reaching the bottom of the landscape at the same @xmath73 , and with the gentler drop from the high-@xmath0 plateau expected for small @xmath46 .",
    "clearly , the essential physical features of the crossover - we make no claim about deeply supercooled liquids - are present at @xmath46=32 and using a larger system would simply fine - tune various numerical estimates at enormous @xcite computational cost .    natural lj units will be used throughout . rather than making a single long",

    "the ist are bookkeeping events as border dynamics prevails , @xmath12 is not @xcite proportional to @xmath38 , there is no effective barrier to leaving a basin and hopping is surely not an apt description .",
    "one might say either that intrabasin dynamics are irrelevant to diffusion , or that no distinction exists between inter- and intra- basin dynamics .    at @xmath101 , @xmath2 looks rather different - the difusive interval has grown to the point that it resembles a conventional msd and easily allows estimation of an intrabasin @xmath8 .",
    "the plateau must be reached eventually , but in the current simulation all we can say is @xmath102 .",
    "comparison with @xmath40 shows ( fig  [ ddis ] ) that @xmath103 , with @xmath8=0.0045 , @xmath12=0.00714 .",
    "the two msd have a brief interval of overlap at the beginning of their linear regimes but soon diverge , so the mechanism is not governed by    intrabasin diffusion and is probably unchanged from @xmath0 = 1.10 .",
    "nonetheless we believe that the emergence of intrabasin diffusion is significant and characteristic of the upper crossover regime .",
    "basins are not harmonic away from the minima and apparently below @xmath24 the higher elevations are rough enough to produce diffusion .",
    "an equivalent statement is that the process is best viewed as a random walk among the saddles @xcite .",
    "configurations in the upper part of a basin are closer to the saddles than to the is and will be assigned accordingly by the critical point mapping . a random walk among saddles connected to a basin",
    "will appear as intrabasin diffusion . at this @xmath0 ordinary diffusion",
    "is also saddle dynamics , so with @xmath103 it follows that unconstrained saddle dynamics is faster than intrabasin saddle dynamics .",
    "the need to utilize an inefficient random walk to escape the basin , and of course the lower thermal energy , has caused the plateau time to increase significantly from its @xmath0 = 1.10 value and @xmath104 holds even more strongly despite an increase in @xmath6 .    in our picture of intrabasin diffusion ,",
    "saddle transitions occur while the is does not change .",
    "we previously discussed bookkeeping ist , where the is changes but there is little actual motion . with several",

    "fig  [ sadis ] shows is    and saddle energies vs @xmath7 at @xmath105 . in the time interval @xmath106 the system undergoes seven is transitions while assigned to the same saddle ( bookkeeping ist ) . for @xmath107",

    "@xmath80 produces a remarkable result .",
    "the period of overlapping linear @xmath7-dependence of @xmath110 and @xmath111 is now substantial , and ( fig  [ ddis ] ) * the true diffusion constant may be calculated from trajectories with no ist .",
    "* the system now stays in a basin long enough that on average intrabasin diffusion is fully developed before an ist occurs , and before the plateau is reached ( although @xmath6 is now approaching @xmath13 , fig  [ ttpl ] ) . under these circumstances diffusion",
    "is _ intrabasin dominated _ , and the ist simply act to keep the process going , ie , to avoid the influence of finite basin size .",
    "intrabasin and unconstrained saddle dynamics ( ordinary diffusion ) are indistinguishable .",
    "we thus have some new    perspective on the changes around @xmath9 . there",
    "the chain of ist becomes @xcite a markov process , and an obvious explanation is that sufficiently long confinement of the system in a basin allows successive ist to lose correlation . while conventionally confinement arises from energy barriers , we find that the system diffuses to the border and crosses with ease .",
    "confinement is produced by diffusion itself ; the time required to escape by the random walk is long even absent a barrier at the border . a sufficiently slow walking about the saddles connected to a basin can produce a markov process among the is themselves , and is dynamics is also a good description of the intrabasin dominated regime . upon close examination ,",
    "the crossover is not simply from saddle dynamics at high @xmath0 to is dynamics at low @xmath0 .",
    "there is a third , intermediate-@xmath0 region where both descriptions are correct , defined by the condition @xmath112 .",
    "arrhenius plots of @xmath8 and @xmath12 are displayed in fig  [ ddis ] .",
    "estimates of @xmath8 are possible for @xmath113 .",
    "linear behavior of @xmath2 is not cleanly visible below @xmath0 = 0.38 and is marginal at @xmath0 = 1.10 ; we expect it disappears at slightly higher @xmath0 , but collecting data where trajectories leave a basin so quickly is difficult .",
    "the intrabasin dominated @xmath112 range , marked by arrows , is approximately @xmath114 .",
    "starting from high @xmath0 , the upper limit of intrabasin dominance is reached when two conditions hold : @xmath0 is low enough for @xmath2 to have a diffusive @xmath7-interval , and @xmath6 adequately exceeds the time at which that interval begins . for the lower limit , either of two conditions may be true : @xmath6 substantially exceeds @xmath13 , so a barrier to leaving the basin exists and activation becomes important , or the linear portion of @xmath2 shrinks so that it no longer represents the intrabasin motion .",
    "in fact , both appear to set in gradually and simultaneously .    at our lowest temperature ,",
    "@xmath0 = 0.34 ( fig  [ msd034 ] ) , @xmath2    rises quickly to the plateau just as at the high @xmath0 = 1.10 ; a linear region of this curve can not be identified and @xmath13 is now back within the 6.25 @xmath74 window .    quantitative estimates of @xmath115 , along with @xmath94 , are shown in fig  [ ttpl ] ; at intermediate @xmath0 all we can say is    @xmath116 . while @xmath13 is short at high @xmath0 because of the abundant thermal energy , it is short at low @xmath0 because the system occupies the lower regions of the basin only .",
    "thus a ) the plateau is reached after a shorter displacement , and b ) the intra - basin motion is mostly fast harmonic oscillations , not diffusion .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath6 curves cross at @xmath117 , and we propose @xmath118 as a new way to define a crossover temperature . below @xmath0 = 0.51",
    "the system explores the accessible portion of the basin more quickly but exits more slowly , indicating barriers at the border .",
    "gradually saddle dynamics loses out to is dynamics as the physical description , @xmath119 below @xmath0 = 0.46 , and barrier crossings assume the rate - limiting role for diffusion .",
    "in addition to the standard analysis of @xmath20 and the results @xcite of very recent work , we now have two new indicators pointing to a change in the mechanism of diffusion at @xmath93 .",
    "the local waiting time @xmath6 crosses @xmath13 at @xmath0 = 0.51 , and intrabasin dominance sets in at @xmath0 = 0.52 with @xmath11 for @xmath120 .",
    "however the crossover develops over a wide temperature range , and involves much more than the presence or absence of hopping , as explained in the last few paragraphs .",
    "we hope it is clear that the is - mapping is a powerful tool for studying the dynamical crossover .",
    "ist - vectors are anticorrelated @xcite at high @xmath0 , and correlation decreases through the crossover range until the ist - markov approximation becomes accurate below @xmath9 .",
    "a substantial negative value of @xmath51 is a sign of saddle or border dynamics , while @xmath121 indicates is or hopping dynamics . is borders are closely spaced near a multidimensional saddle .",
    "anticorrelation is required for the bookkeeping ist arising from a small motion through such a region to not , wrongly , predict a large motion .",
    "it implies that saddle dynamics is a more physical description than is dynamics .",
    "a simple process appears complicated when formulated with inappropriate elementary steps , and loss of correlation signals the onset of the low-@xmath0 mechanism , which is truly is dynamics .",
    "analysis of the msd within the basin of attraction of an is , @xmath2 , proved quite fruitful .",
    "we will now see that such is also the case for the msd of the is itself , @xmath3 , leading to another informative correlation , that of the return vector and the is configuration . with the definitions from the introduction ,",
    "@xmath122 it follows that @xmath123 unless the is displacement , @xmath124 , and the return vector displacement , @xmath125 , are anticorrelated .",
    "fig  [ msds ] shows that at @xmath0 = 1.00 , @xmath3 lies    _ above _ @xmath40 , they nearly sumerimpose at @xmath0 = 0.80 , and the obvious @xmath123 holds at @xmath126 . thus the pattern of anticorrelation of ist - vectors @xmath127 at high @xmath0 , decreasing with decreasing @xmath0 ,",
    "is repeated with the @xmath128 correlation .    for a more quantitative analysis",
    "we have calculated @xmath129 .",
    "one anticipates a rapid decay of @xmath130 leading to @xmath131 and this expectation is correct .",
    "the correlation @xmath132 , determined from @xmath40 , @xmath3 , and @xmath129 via eq  [ msdeq ] , decays quickly ( fig  [ cru ] ) to an asymptotic negative value which decreases in amplitude with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "we suggest that @xmath133 is a direct measure of the degree of _ borderism _ - the extent to which the system lives on the is - borders @xcite .    expressing @xmath124 as the sum of the ist - vectors the most important contributions are evident ,",
    "@xmath134 the first term on the rhs may be understood with fig  [ anticor ] , a one - dimensional illustration of the situation at time @xmath7 , just after the @xmath135th ist .",
    "the system has moved from the left- to the right - hand basin and it follows that @xmath136 and @xmath65 point in opposite directions , with a negative contribution to @xmath133 .",
    "for the second term on the rhs , set @xmath7 = 0 in fig  [ anticor ] .",
    "the first ist will occur from right to left in the future so change @xmath136 to @xmath137 and reverse its direction .",
    "the vectors now point in the same direction so with the minus sign in eq  [ crq ] this contribution to @xmath133 is also negative . in the @xmath22 dimensional configuration space ( or @xmath138 dimensional local region space )",
    "the vectors will be distributed about the @xmath83 = 1 relative orientations , reducing the dot products .",
    "the geometrical arguments apply when @xmath139 is evaluated just before , and @xmath65 just after , an ist . for border dynamics these conditions always hold and @xmath140 . on the other hand",
    "if the system oscillates about the is for long periods between ist , the low-@xmath0 scenario , the return vector has no special relation to any ist vector at any time and @xmath141 .",
    "the correlation of @xmath124 and @xmath125 is a maximum for pure border dynamics and vanishes in a hopping model .",
    "the interesting part of @xmath133 is its asymptotic value and we define @xmath142 as the _ border index_. the @xmath0-dependence of the border index is shown in fig  [ bordr ] .",
    "it extrapolates to zero via    power - law fit for @xmath143 at @xmath0 = 0.53 , yielding another physically appealing route to a crossover temperature .",
    "the fit range differs from that used for @xmath9 but @xmath68 is close enough ( power = 0.74 ) to linear in @xmath0 that we expect only a small effect .",
    "in the foregoing we have examined the @xmath0-dependent physical mechanism of diffusion in unit - density lj . for some perspective , it is useful to ask why this is a nontrivial problem .",
    "lj is classified @xcite as weak / nonfragile , indicating weak @xmath0-dependence at high @xmath0 and a constant activation energy at low @xmath0 .",
    "the simulated diffusion constant is indeed well represented by @xmath144 for @xmath78 ; @xmath145 = 1.16 .",
    "the factor of @xmath0 is appropriate because @xmath146 at high @xmath0 and constant density .",
    "linear or other multiplicative powers are not very important when fitting over several decades but we have only @xmath147 and they significantly influence the goodness of fit and the value obtained for the activation energy . despite the simplicity of eq  [ fit ] , fitting @xcite the same data to a power law for @xmath148 yields a reasonable @xcite @xmath9 .",
    "one might well wonder if anything is going on beyond a gradual change from @xmath149 to @xmath150 . that is a bare - bones prescription for a transition to hopping , consistent with the ist approaching a markov chain @xcite and the saddle order extrapolating to zero @xcite .",
    "however it then seems odd that @xmath145 = 1.16 does not appear as a characteristic dynamical temperature instead of various @xmath93 , and the sharp drop in @xmath31 around @xmath9 suggests that the crossover is more interesting . to investigate this crucial point",
    "we have begun @xcite to catalog the saddles and barrier heights in unit - density lj . starting from the thermal configuration the is is determined and the connected first - order saddles are found @xcite by eigenmode following .",
    "steepest descent from the saddle yields barrier heights @xmath151 , which may be collected as a function of is energy @xcite or of the original temperature .",
    "preliminary results @xcite are that the barrier heights increase through the slope region @xcite of @xmath31 from @xmath152 = 2.8 to @xmath153 = 3.7 ; @xmath0 is less than the averaged barrier height for the entire range of this study .",
    "the same result has recently been obtained @xcite in a soft - sphere mixture .",
    "comparisons of barrier heights to @xmath0 must be made carefully .",
    "most discussions of barrier crossing assume that @xmath151 is much greater then @xmath0 , but that does not apply here and one might argue that the relevant height is @xmath154 . even with such a modification , average barrier heights remain larger than @xmath145 , indicating - along with the new results found above - that the mechanism of diffusion in lj is highly non - trivial .",
    "there are two explanations for the clear presence of a high-@xmath0 mechanism with free motion among the basins at @xmath49 despite an apparent requirement for activated hopping .",
    "one is the broad distribution of barrier heights , reflected in the low @xmath155 for the kww distribution of local waiting times .",
    "even if @xmath0 falls below @xmath156 , there will be no transition to low-@xmath0 dynamics if enough low barriers remain .",
    "the average alone does not adequately describe the physics .",
    "furthermore there are several ways to perform the average @xcite and a physically motivated choice must be made .",
    "for example a calculation of @xmath156 including saddles of all orders would be nonsense , since high barriers which are never visited in thermal motion would dominate .",
    "averaging over first order saddles eliminates many irrelevant high barriers , but not necessarily all .",
    "other topological features such as the connectivity of the is and saddles should be important as well .",
    "the landscape determines @xmath9 and more generally @xmath20 through the interplay of several physically significant effects .",
    "note that one important landscape quantity , @xmath31 , is a thermodynamic property of the basins .",
    "one can imagine different liquids with the same @xmath31 and different t - dependent distributions of barrier heights , giving rise to quite different activation energies and other aspects of dynamics .",
    "another is found in cavagna s @xcite argument that barrriers are irrelevant while the saddle mechanism dominates , so the action of a high-@xmath0 mechanism while @xmath0 is less than @xmath157 need present no conundrum .",
    "then , when the saddle mechanism shuts down and activation becomes required at @xmath93 , the barrier heights have already completed most of their growth .",
    "the system will exhibit approximate arrhenius behavior upon further cooling .",
    "cavagna gives a fragile scenario where the barriers are already @xmath158 at @xmath9 , for a very strong increase in relaxation time .",
    "however although we have @xmath159 , @xmath145 is only @xmath97 , presumable due to the importance of low - barrier paths . relatively weak arrhenius behavior at @xmath160 results , consistent with lj being @xcite a weak / nonfragile liquid .",
    "even if @xmath161 is not meaningful at higher @xmath0 , eq  [ fit ] can still fit the data because the arrhenius factor is approaching its @xmath145-independent high-@xmath0 limit .",
    "saddle dynamics , in which @xmath20 is @xcite proportional to the number of @xmath84 instantaneous normal modes or @xcite the saddle order @xmath162 , apparently is consistent with @xmath146 .",
    "thus eq  [ fit ] can represent the full @xmath0-range , but the empirical activation energy is a compromise resulting from the fitting process with no simple relation to a barrier height .    in either case",
    "the crossover is seen to be a subtle , complex process .",
    "application of the is - mapping has revealed far more then could be deduced from @xmath20 alone , including : 1 .",
    "intrabasin and intrabasin _ dominated _ diffusion , associated with saddle dynamics 2 .",
    "the distribution of local waiting times , well behaved as @xmath163 , calculated from the simulated distribution with the idea that the configuration space is a composite 3 . a new , physically appealing criterion for dynamical crossover , @xmath14 4 .",
    "a quantitative indicator @xmath68 of the dominance of saddle or border dynamics ( borderism ) , which also yields a crossover temperature .",
    "the value of @xmath164 , from a power - law fit to @xmath20 , is now just one of many pieces of evidence that a dynamical crossover occurs at @xmath93 . from recent prior work @xcite : 1 .",
    "is energy @xmath31 is undergoing its steepest fall .",
    "the true bottom is uncertain due to cooling - rate dependence and point 1 . only identifies the general vicinity of the crossover .",
    "2 . saddle order @xmath72 also extrapolates to zero at @xmath0 = 0.52 3 .",
    "ist - markov approximation becomes accurate at @xmath15 . in this paper",
    "we have added : 4 .",
    "@xmath11 , diffusion is intrabasin dominated , for @xmath120 .",
    "local waiting time reaches time to explore basin , @xmath14 , at @xmath0 = 0.51 .",
    "border index @xmath68 extrapolates to zero , @xmath0 = 0.53 .",
    "we suggest that points 3 - 5 are particularly direct evidence that the mechanism of diffusion is changing .",
    "they are based on ideas about the mechanism itself , while a fit to @xmath20 produces a characteristic temperature based upon the symptoms. although 1 - 6 focus attention on a narrow range @xmath165 the crossover is gradual and might be thought to take place over @xmath113 , the interval where intrabasin diffusion can be detected , encompassing the slope of @xmath31 .",
    "this agrees roughly with having the crossover begin at @xmath24 .",
    "we believe it significant that intrabasin diffusion can produce confinement for times long enough that the ist become a markov chain , _ without _ invoking barriers .",
    "thus diffusive confinement and confinement by barriers become two distinct features of the mechanism .",
    "since intrabasin diffusion can be explained as saddle dynamics , our work fits with the growing recognition that the saddles of the landscape need to be considered on an even footing with the is .",
    "there is no contradiction in having the intrabasin diffusion and ist - markov regimes overlap . in the latter case @xmath166 , and in the former , since escape from a basin requires diffusion to the border , @xmath167 .",
    "our simulation model exhibits most of the physical features currently being discussed for moderately supercooled dynamics , as well as some found here for the first time .",
    "there is much to be learned from lj , @xmath46 = 32 , although of course we intend to apply our methods to other liquids .",
    "it is difficult to achieve equilibrium below @xmath9 .",
    "note that , even though we report data down to @xmath0 = 0.34 , only one significant @xmath0 appearing in the above estimates is below 0.50 , the end of intrabasin dominance at @xmath0 = 0.46 .",
    "our interest is the crossover and the lowest , probably non - equilibrated , @xmath0 are not required for the principal conslusions .",
    "we would like to thank frank stillinger for valuable discussions .",
