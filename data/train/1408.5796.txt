    "we address the mutual disappearance of opposite - polarity magnetic elements from the solar photosphere following their apparent `` collisions , '' as observed in line - of - sight magnetograms .",
    "this phenomenon is called `` magnetic flux cancellation '' @xcite .",
    "the study of magnetic flux cancellation is important for understanding the nature of the flux removal process from the solar surface layers .",
    "@xcite investigated five flux cancellation events at granular scales in which the horizontal magnetic fields between the canceling opposite - polarity magnetic elements were detected in only one event that takes place in a small emerging flux region .",
    "this finding is interesting since almost all theoretical scenarios proposed to explain photospheric flux cancellation expect an increase in the horizontal magnetic field between the canceling opposite - polarity magnetic elements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "magnetic reconnection in the photosphere or around the temperature minimum region has been proposed to explain the formation of the horizontal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "such horizontal magnetic fields have been observed in some events @xcite .",
    "prior to the work of @xcite , only one flux cancellation event without a detection of horizontal magnetic field was reported @xcite .",
    "the increase in horizontal magnetic field expected theoretically has not been commonly observed at least in flux cancellation events at granular scales @xcite . the solar optical telescope ( sot ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on board _ hinode _",
    "@xcite has shown that these small - scale flux cancellation events at granular scales may be observed everywhere on the solar surface which clearly makes this phenomenon key to understanding the removal of photospheric magnetic flux .",
    "@xcite suggested that flux cancellations with and without detectable horizontal fields are physically distinct processes .",
    "they also cautioned that the sot observations of flux removal events at granular scales without the appearance of the horizontal fields may not be spatially resolved .",
    "this caution is based only on the null detection of linear polarization signals representing horizontal magnetic fields .",
    "however , circular polarization signals ( stokes _ v _ ) are also detected at the polarity inversion line in these events . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the observational implications of the observed stokes _ v _",
    "profiles for the spatially unresolved flux removal process .",
    "the doppler velocity at the flux cancellation site is an important parameter that may discriminate between an emerging u - loop model or a submerging @xmath0-loop model ( see figure  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "the zero - crossing wavelength of the stokes _ v _ profile is sometimes used to derive a doppler velocity of the magnetized atmosphere .",
    "however , the stokes _ v _ profiles observed along the polarity inversion line often take asymmetric or multi - lobed forms ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "it is difficult to determine the zero - crossing wavelength of such anomalous stokes _ v _",
    "there are two processes commonly invoked to explain anomalous stokes _ v _ profile : ( 1 ) a coupling of gradients in velocity and magnetic field along the line - of - sight ( los ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or ( 2 ) the superposition of two or more magnetic components of both polarities with relative doppler shifts within a resolution element ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a correct interpretation of the anomalous stokes _ v _",
    "profiles is essential for interpreting the magnetic field structures in the neighborhood of the polarity inversion line between the canceling magnetic elements .",
    "we investigate circular polarization ( stokes _ v _ ) profiles at the polarity inversion line formed by canceling opposite - polarity magnetic elements just outside an active region noaa 10944 on 2007 march 2 .",
    "the sot spectropolarimeter ( sp , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provides the stokes profiles with a @xmath1 slit width and a @xmath2 pixel sampling along the slit .",
    "the stokes profiles were measured with an integration time of 4.8 s at each slit position .",
    "the calibration of the stokes profiles was done with a standard procedure @xcite .",
    "the total circular polarization ( @xmath3 ) is estimated as follows : @xmath4 the center of the fe 630.25 nm line ( @xmath5 ) is defined in each pixel as the center of gravity of the stokes _ i _ profile .",
    "the local continuum intensity ( @xmath6 ) is defined as the average of the stokes _ i _ profile from @xmath7 pm to @xmath8 pm .",
    "figure  [ fig_sfov1 ] shows a map of the total circular polarization for our target cancellation event .",
    "the opposite - polarity magnetic elements independently appear in the quiet area outside the moat region and then approach each other .",
    "the cancellation activity of these magnetic elements is observed during a 10 minute period after the map of figure  [ fig_sfov1 ] , but the linear polarization signal does not increase near the polarity inversion line during the cancellation .",
    "the temporal evolution and detailed properties of this cancellation event were described as `` region a '' in @xcite .",
    "doppler shifts are derived both from @xmath5 of the stokes _ i _ profile and from the zero - crossing wavelength of the stokes _ v _ profile . a reference wavelength to the doppler shift",
    "is the average of @xmath5 of stokes _",
    "i _ profiles in the quiet area , and the same value is used as the reference wavelength for the zero - crossing wavelength of stokes _ v _ profiles .",
    "the zero - crossing wavelength is derived by the linear fit to successive four wavelength points crossing the zero .",
    "a highly asymmetric , strongly redshifted stokes _ v _ profile in the fe 630.25 nm line is observed at the polarity inversion line , as shown in figure  [ fig_profile1]_d_. if we interpret the shift of the zero - crossing wavelength as being caused by a doppler velocity , it would be 3.3 km s@xmath9 , which is much higher than the doppler velocity of the stokes _ i _ profile ( -0.6 km s@xmath9 ) . the three - lobed shape is more clearly seen in the stokes _ v _ profile of fe 630.15 nm ( figure  [ fig_profile6301]_a _ ) , and one of two zero - crossing wavelength positions is more redshifted for the fe 630.25 nm line .",
    "hereafter , we try to explain such a strange stokes _ v _ profile by mixing profiles of the canceling magnetic elements .",
    "the stokes _ v _ profile at the polarity inversion line ( @xmath10 ) is synthesized as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the stokes _ v _ profiles observed at the pixels next to the polarity inversion line on the positive polarity side and on the negative polarity side , respectively ( figures  [ fig_profile1]_e _ and [ fig_profile1]_f _ ) .",
    "note that nearly symmetric stokes _",
    "profiles are observed at the pixels next to the polarity inversion line .",
    "the positive constant values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are determined to minimize the difference between the observed stokes _ v _ profile and the synthesized profile at the polarity inversion line inside a wavelength range of @xmath16 43.1 pm from the averaged center of the fe 630.25 nm line .",
    "the values calculated from this fit are @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the synthesized stokes _ v _",
    "profile is shown by the diamond symbols in figure  [ fig_profile1]_d _ , and it looks very similar to the observed one .",
    "most of local dips and peaks in the stokes _ v _ profile at the polarity inversion line are successfully demonstrated in spite of such a simple summation of the observed stokes _ v",
    "_ profiles .",
    "@xcite performed a similar addition of opposite - polarity stokes _ v _ profiles to reproduce multi - lobed stokes _ v _ profiles like those within sunspot penumbrae .",
    "he stressed the importance of relative doppler shifts between the opposite polarity elements . in the present work ,",
    "we infer a relative doppler velocity of 1.3 km s@xmath9 between the pixels next to the polarity inversion line , but we find a relative difference of -0.3 km s@xmath9 for the corresponding stokes _",
    "i _ profiles .",
    "the different spectral extents of the stokes _ v _ lobes in the positive and negative - polarity magnetic elements also help in the generation of anomalous stokes _ v _ profile at the polarity inversion line .",
    "the different spectral extents originate from the difference in the field strength of the canceling opposite polarity magnetic patches .",
    "figure  [ fig_profile6301]_a _ shows that the reproduction of the stokes _ v _ profile in the fe 630.15 nm line is as good as that of the fe 630.25 nm line with similar values for @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath19 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "similar results are obtained at the neighboring pixel along the polarity inversion line , as shown in figures  [ fig_profile2]_d - f_. a three - lobed profile is observed at the polarity inversion line , which is produced by the sum of the observed profiles at the pixels next to the polarity inversion line . in this case , the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 are 0.52 and 0.54 for the stokes _ v _ profile in the fe 630.25 nm line , respectively .",
    "these values are similar to those of the previous case .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is 0.49 and @xmath15 is 0.61 for the fe 630.15 nm line .",
    "the different coefficients between the two fe lines may be caused by the height gradient of the magnetic field structures at the pixel of polarity inversion line or at the neighboring pixels .",
    "highly asymmetric or three - lobed stokes _ v _ profiles are observed at the polarity inversion line between the canceling magnetic elements . such anomalous stokes",
    "profiles at the polarity inversion line are successfully produced by the sum of the stokes _ v _ profiles observed at the pixels next to the polarity inversion line .",
    "this could serve to warn of over - interpreting stokes profiles observed at the polarity inversion line .",
    "for example , the doppler velocity derived from the zero - crossing wavelength of the stokes v profile is not necessarily reliable .",
    "the mixture of opposite - polarity stokes _ v _ profiles with a relative doppler shift causes the anomalous stokes _ v _",
    "profiles at the polarity inversion line formed by canceling opposite - polarity magnetic elements like those observed in the penumbra @xcite .",
    "the large relative doppler shift is not observed in the stokes _ i _ profiles , but is observed in the stokes _ v _ profiles at the pixels next to the polarity inversion line .",
    "the combination of opposite - polarity stokes _ v _ profiles could originate from the presence of unresolved opposite - polarity magnetic elements or the unresolved boundary between the opposite polarity patches .",
    "we can not investigate the mixture of magnetic fields within the pixel because we analyze stokes profiles in a single pixel of 0@xmath20.16 width which is about half of a diffraction limit of a 50 cm diameter telescope at 630.25 nm .",
    "the diffraction - limited performance of the telescope with a strehl ratio of about 0.8 was confirmed with images taken by the broadband filter imager of sot @xcite .",
    "the rms contrast of the continuum intensity is 8.1@xmath21 in our data set , which is similar to the rms contrast ( 8.5@xmath21 ) of a synthetic image from the mhd simulation that was degraded by a point - spread function of the sot / sp without the defocus in @xcite .",
    "this means that our observations are performed under the almost best focus condition and the size of a resolution element is about 0.32 . although it is difficult to clearly distinguish the mixture of unresolved opposite polarity elements from the unresolved boundary between the opposite polarity magnetic patches , our result may support the later case because we can reproduce the stokes _ v _ profiles at the polarity inversion line using a fraction of the neighboring profiles , i.e. there are no indications of other magnetic elements in the area .",
    "magnetic flux disappears in this flux cancellation event during our observing period @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is expected that a magnetic flux removal process is actually operative in this event .",
    "however , our results suggest that the stokes _ v _ profile arising from the flux removal process is not yet detected , at least in the event studied herein .",
    "the mixture of the opposite polarity magnetic elements to be canceled is limited within a local area around the polarity inversion line since nearly symmetric profiles are observed at the pixels next to the polarity inversion line .",
    "one possibility of a lack of the stokes _ v _ profile arising from the flux removal process is that the spatial resolution of the sot / sp ( @xmath22200 km ) is still insufficient to detect the removal process of photospheric magnetic flux @xcite . whether it is possible to observe the horizontal fields expected in the flux - removal process of the event studied depends on both observational resolution as well as the actual mhd nature of this process .",
    "the latter is worthy of theoretical investigation but lies outside the scope of the paper . for the present",
    "there is much to learn from stokes - polarimetric analysis of photospheric events involving the interaction of flux elements of opposite magnetic polarities such as presented in our paper and elsewhere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
