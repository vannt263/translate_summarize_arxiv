    "functional organic adsorbates are of special interest to surface nanotechnology .",
    "their ability to selectively trigger dynamical changes in surface domains on molecular length scales opens many relevant applications in technology . a specifically interesting class of functional molecules",
    "are molecular switches@xcite , which can be reversibly switched between two or more stable geometries .",
    "switching of these molecules adsorbed on surfaces can occur via photo - excitation@xcite or inelastic electron scattering events@xcite .",
    "a typical problem to the design of such systems is the loss of photo - induced switching function of gas - phase molecules upon adsorption to a surface , such as in the case of the prototypical conformational cis - trans ( z - e ) switch azobenzene ( ab ) on coinage metal surfaces@xcite .",
    "very often this loss of function is related to overly strong coupling to the surface electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "this coupling modifies ground - state energetics@xcite and , even more importantly , is expected to change excited - state mechanisms and lifetimes . for the ab case recent experiments have e.g. shown that for the supposedly minimized coupling of a derivative of azobenzene with bulky spacer groups , namely _",
    "tetr_-tert .- butyl - azobenzene ( tba ) , the switching function can indeed be retrieved at au(111 ) @xcite , while no switching is observed for the azobenzene and tba on ag(111 ) .",
    "a plethora of spectroscopical techniques gives access to the changes in electronic structure that underlie corresponding excited - state dynamical processes .",
    "still , often enough the accessible observables do not permit to formulate a precise molecular mechanism , which in turn is a prerequisite to the understanding and subsequent design of corresponding systems .",
    "first - principles modelling techniques have in turn proven to be valuable tools for the investigation of such mechanistic details , but are challenged by the large system sizes and the necessity to simultaneously describe localized molecular orbitals ( mos ) and the metallic surface band structure . _",
    "ab initio _ quantum mechanical simulations , such as density - functional theory ( dft)@xcite or post - hartree - fock approaches@xcite , have a successful history as such tools in surface science and chemistry .",
    "the current state - of - the - art provides , in many cases , a reliable description of ground - state properties , including adsorption geometries , energetics as well as thermal barriers . when it comes to the description of spectroscopy and excited - state properties , quantum chemical approaches are the optimal choice for finite systems or isolating materials , where cluster approximations are possible .",
    "they are currently not applicable to metallic systems though , where periodic boundary conditions are necessary to correctly describe the delocalized electronic structure .",
    "applicable excited - state methods for this case include time dependent dft ( td - dft ) @xcite , or many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) based methods@xcite , the latter enabling the description of both , ionic ( gw)@xcite and neutral ( bethe - salpeter equation , bse)@xcite electronic excitations . in recent years",
    ", computational cost and accuracy of these approaches has improved tremendously .",
    "nevertheless , current computer infrastructure and the remaining accuracy issues of applied density - functional approximations and self - energy descriptions render systematic excited - state studies of large systems virtually intractable at the time . in this situation",
    ", a need exists for highly efficient excited - state schemes that , while maybe not fully quantitative , allow for a qualitatively correct description of the major physical effects that govern excited - state processes at surfaces .",
    "already very early in the history of dft , attempts to apply and/or generalize the method beyond hohenberg and kohns rigorous proof@xcite and towards non - equilibrium excited - state properties have been undertaken .",
    "many of them with the specific aim for a highly efficient description .",
    "the most rigorous and major extension was the runge - gross proof of a one - to - one correspondence between the time - dependent potential and the time - dependent electron density@xcite .",
    "another line of development are functionals generalized to fractional occupation numbers@xcite , which has led to the standard dft treatment for metallic systems@xcite . utilizing a lagrange multiplier formalism , dederichs _ _ et al.__@xcite",
    "have shown how to construct constrained density functionals@xcite , constraining electrons into specific regions of space or spin channels .",
    "this very efficient method has been heavily utilized to describe electron - transfer processes@xcite , but also surface reactions@xcite .",
    "another very early approach is based on converging the density with respect to non - equilibrium electron occupations that resemble excitations , so called delta - self - consistent field dft ( @xmath0scf - dft)@xcite .",
    "this approach , in different variations , has had a comeback in recent years due to its success on molecular charge - transfer excitations@xcite , which are badly described by adiabadic linear - response ( lr ) td - dft using standard semi - local exchange - correlation ( xc ) kernels@xcite .",
    "although in principle without any formal justification , this method has recently been put into context by a number of different works .",
    "ziegler and coworkers identified a close connection to a constrained variational procedure@xcite , which then provides a direct link to lrtd - dft@xcite .",
    "theoretical works by grling@xcite and ayers _ _ et al.__@xcite in turn point towards a possible formal basis for an excited - state density functional and would , at least in the case of the exact xc - functional , justify a corresponding treatment .    in the context of metal - surface adsorbed molecules an interesting extension to @xmath0scf - dft was put forward by gavnholt _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "this so - called linear expansion @xmath0scf ( le@xmath0scf ) scheme centers on resonance states that resemble gas - phase adsorbate orbitals , and enforces their occupation in the self - consistent density .",
    "this not only provides a well - defined constraint for intra - molecular excitations of the adsorbate , but also enables the description of photoemission and charge - transfer excitations .",
    "the method has already been successfully applied to several smaller adsorbate systems@xcite and promises at least semi - quantitative results , while adding only little computational overhead to ground - state dft calculations . in this work",
    "we strive to generalize this le@xmath0scf approach as an efficient means to the calculation of excited - state potential - energy surfaces ( pess ) for large metal - adsorbed molecules .",
    "we present necessary modifications to the method that allow the calculation of intra - adsorbate as well as substrate - mediated charge - transfer excitations within the same formalism . implementing the method into the ultrasoft pseudopotential plane wave code castep@xcite",
    ", we initially compare the ability of this le@xmath0scf scheme to describe excited - state pess in the gas phase , and establish the equivalence to simple @xmath0scf for this limit of no molecule - substrate interaction .",
    "thereafter we illustrate what kind of insights can be gained from this approach for the showcase azobenzene adsorbed on extended ag(111 ) and au(111 ) surfaces .",
    "already from the computed lowest - lying intra - molecular excitations along the two most important gas - phase isomerization pathways we can conclude on intriguing surface - induced pes modifications with direct bearings on the isomerization mechanism .",
    "in the following section we briefly revisit the @xmath0scf method and introduce the rationale behind le@xmath0scf as well as our modification and implementation of it .      detailed descriptions of the @xmath0scf - dft approach have already been given numerous times in literature@xcite .",
    "in the simplest case , excitations are modelled by reordering orbital occupation between states that mainly contribute to a transition .",
    "this changed population generates a modified density under which the kohn - sham ( ks ) equations@xcite are solved .",
    "singlet excitations are modelled by changing populations within one spin channel , triplet excitations by switching channels .",
    "certain care has to be taken to ensure the correct calculation of singlet states .",
    "a generally used correction method is zieglers sum rule@xcite : @xmath1 .",
    "if the system does not show magnetization and the ground state is a singlet state , singlet excitations can also be calculated to a reasonable approximation without taking spin explicitly into account .",
    "this has been shown for the case of gas phase azobenzene@xcite , o@xmath2 on al ( 111)@xcite and recently also for iridium complexes@xcite , the latter work also providing a rationalization for the success of this approach .",
    "corresponding constraints provide a reasonable description of excited states that are well described as single - particle state - to - state transitions , although the variational adaptation of the ks states with respect to the excited - state density clearly does give additional flexibility .",
    "definition of such single - electron excitation constraints is a simple matter when molecular states can be clearly identified in character and are well separated spatially and energetically .",
    "this is almost always the case in minimum - energy structures of isolated organic molecules .",
    "more reactive geometries , _",
    "i.e. _ transition - state structures , can already contain state degeneracies that hamper convergence .",
    "in such a case minimal smearing of the occupation constraint might enable calculation with only a small additional error in energy@xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the case of the excitation spectrum of molecules interacting with periodic structures , where degeneracies are ubiquitous , such a simple approach will strongly affect the character and the absolute energy of the excitation .",
    "in this situation one also has to distinguish between adsorbates interacting with isolating surfaces and adsorbates on metals . in the first case ,",
    "substrate states are mainly localized and generally exhibit strong hybridization with adsorbate states similar to interactions between two covalently interacting molecules .",
    "such hybridization can in principle completely modify the character and the energy of states , but will again generate states that are localized and can , in the best case , be identified in their character and occupied correspondingly .",
    "therefore a simple @xmath0scf approach should still capture the main part of the transition .",
    "in the case of transition metal substrates , however , interactions are twofold . following the newns - anderson model@xcite",
    ", chemisorbed molecules will show strong hybridization with _",
    "d_-bands , which modifies character , splitting and energetic position of the frontier orbitals .",
    "simultaneously , there will also be a weak hybridization due to interaction with _",
    "s_- and _ p_-bands .",
    "this broadens molecular states and spreads their character over many bands in a small energy window .",
    "in such a case a simple @xmath0scf approach , that occupies the band with the highest overlap compared to a gas - phase molecular state , will miss significant parts of the transition and therefore strongly underestimate the change in density .",
    "gavnholt _ _ et al.__@xcite have devised the linear expansion @xmath0scf ( le@xmath0scf ) approach to specifically target such systems . in their approach",
    "they do not just define constraints on ks states , but on linear combinations of them . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us shortly recapitulate the ground - state case for an isolated system ( or for an extended system for each @xmath3-point separately ) .",

    "is constructed from the \\{@xmath7 } via @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the occupation of the state i. in a @xmath10 ground - state calculation this results in @xmath11 for a finite system with @xmath12 being the number of electrons of the system , or in case of an extended system @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the mathematical weight for each @xmath3-point and @xmath15 being the fermi energy . in simple @xmath0scf calculations",
    "one instead constructs the density by replacing one of the states in the sum with another originally unoccupied virtual ks state . in le@xmath0scf , gavnholt",

    "the excited - state density then follows as @xmath20    equation [ ledscfpsi ] thus constructs a new ks state from unoccupied orbitals which resemble the chosen reference state and which are then used to construct the excited - state density .",
    "this approach can readily be used to model intra - molecular highest occupied mo ( homo)- lowest unoccupied mo ( lumo ) type excitations , where an equal number of electrons and holes are excited in the adsorbate , but also for adsorbate - substrate charge - transfer , where only a hole or an additional electron is enforced on the adsorbate states . in this case",
    ", the occupation of the remaining states has to be adjusted by lowering or increasing the fermi energy correspondingly in order to conserve the total electron number of the whole system .",
    "this approximation to an excitation can be justified by the large ensemble of substrate electrons which occupy metal bands of very similar character , such that removing one such band from the density should induce only a minor error on the excitation energy . summarizing the approach , those parts of the reference orbital , which are not yet included in the first n@xmath21 - 1 ground state occupied orbitals",
    "are constructed from a range of virtual ks states by projecting out components resembling this state and subsequently including them in the density .",
    "the ground - state ks procedure is therefore modified in the construction of the density ( eq . [ ledscfdens ] ) in every scf step .",
    "following this approach the kinetic energy of the system has to be corrected for the terms due to the newly added constraint orbital@xcite .",
    "when breaking spin symmetry or including different positions in momentum space ( @xmath3-point sampling ) the procedure is followed independently for different spin channels or at different @xmath3-points .",
    "this approach is ideally suited for the description of inverse photo - emission and for diatomics on transition metal surfaces and was shown to outperform spatially constrained dft approaches as well as simple @xmath0scf @xcite .      in the following",
    "we would like to generalize the le@xmath0scf approach in two aspects .",
    "first of all to allow for an arbitrary number of constraints constructed from arbitrary reference states without discriminating between occupied and unoccupied states .",
    "this provides a more consistent infrastructure for the description of intra - molecular as well as charge - transfer excitations , and might even open the application to systems very different from adsorbate - substrate complexes .",
    "secondly , the approach should enable the construction of excited - state pess for large adsorbates in arbitrary geometries , while in the limit of infinite separation between adsorbate and substrate it should retrieve the simple @xmath0scf result . in order to achieve this , certain conditions on the reference states @xmath22 have to be imposed .",

    "[ occ_constraint ] the @xmath30 s are given by the aspired constraint definition , while occupations @xmath31 have to be adapted to conserve the electron number .",
    "due to the modified construction of the ks states and the occupation reordering , there is no need for modification of the density construction routine itself .",
    "the modified ks states and excited - state occupations also enter in the calculation of the kinetic energy , which is therefore implicitly treated correctly , again without need of further modification as was necessary in the original implementation of gavnholt _ et al .",
    "_ in the gpaw package@xcite .",
    "constraints are enforced independently in different spin channels and at different @xmath3-space positions .",
    "this approach only differs from the simple @xmath0scf approach by the modification of the ks states , which corresponds to a unitary transformation and forces the resulting ks solution to include the specified resonances .",
    "it naturally accounts for the hybridization - induced broadening of the adsorbate ks states at the surface and in all cases includes or removes the _ whole _ reference state . in contrast",
    ", a strong limitation of the method lies in hybridization effects that go beyond this . due to the interaction of the sub - systems ( molecule and surface ) ,",
    "hybridization of the system can already lead to ground - state occupations that are very different from the separated sub - system case .",
    "the correct treatment of electron transitions then has to start from this occupation and transfer the corresponding amount of electrons effectively as we will discuss in the application to adsorbed azobenzene below .",
    "concerning the calculation of energy derivatives , this approach suffers from similar problems as the original implementation of le@xmath0scf does .",

    "the choice of the reference state fell on a virtual ground - state ks state of the gas - phase adsorbate ( @xmath0scf@xmath32 ) .",
    "as shown schematically in column 3 of fig .",
    "[ dscf - scheme ] , this corresponds to calculating the sc excited - state solution , while forcing the constrained orbital into the non - sc ( or ground - state ) solution .",
    "this might be a valid approximation , if the molecular state of interest does not change strongly due to screening in the excited state .",
    "particularly for the description of vertical excitation energies of equilibrium geometries or pess of small adsorbates where a small number of degrees of freedom defines the ks states , this might be a good choice .",
    "this was nicely shown for the calculation of excited - state pess of small diatomics on transition metal surfaces@xcite .",
    "the single nuclear degree of freedom in this case reduces the chance of large variations in character and extent of the orbitals between ground - state and excited - state solutions .",
    "notwithstanding , in many cases this approximation will fail , namely when the ground - state optimized orbital is not a good approximation to the final excited - state ks state .",
    "this is in fact the general case for the frontier orbitals of molecules with many degrees of freedom and/or extended @xmath33-systems in non - equilibrium geometries , and is especially true when applying standard semi - local exchange - correlation ( xc ) functionals . in the latter case",
    "it is known from lrtd - dft treatments that the qualitatively wrong description of ground - state molecular resonances in semi - local functionals hampers the description of non - equilibrium geometries and charge - transfer excitations@xcite .",
    "this problem can to some extent be resolved by including the correct 1/r density - density - response behaviour into the xc - functional description@xcite .",
    "a big strength of the simple @xmath0scf approach is in this respect its additional flexibility due to the variational optimization of the orbitals .",
    "although the definition of the excitation itself is primitive compared to lrtd - dft , the additional variation allows for a consistent - quality description for large portions of pess and the qualitatively correct description of charge - transfer states and other problematic cases already with a semi - local or hybrid xc - functional@xcite .",
    "the absolute excitation energies will nonetheless be determined by the quality of the underlying xc functional , meaning that an underestimation of _",
    "e.g. _ the homo - lumo gap due to self - interaction error will also carry over to the excited - state description .",
    "some of this @xmath0scf flexibility is lost due to the projection inherent in le@xmath0scf . in order to also ensure a correct sc treatment of the actually constraint orbitals",
    ", one has to provide reference states @xmath22 that are already optimized to the specific excited state of interest .",
    "this can for example be done by calculating the simple @xmath0scf solution of the excited - state reference system ( here the gas - phase molecule ) and then including reference states into the le@xmath0scf calculation that are already in the final excited state ( le@xmath0scf@xmath34 , cf .",

    "the barrier along inversion is almost unchanged , whereas the rotational barrier is strongly modified .",
    "compared to the gas - phase case , the stability of the z - ab isomer is drastically reduced from a basin depth of 1@xmath41ev to 0.05@xmath41ev or 0.38@xmath41ev at ag(111 ) and au(111 ) , respectively ( zero - point - energy corrected values from ref . ) . in the context of photo - induced e@xmath36z isomerization , this implies that vibrationally hot molecules on ag(111 ) after deexcitation are liable to thermal re - isomerization to the e - ab isomer .",
    "the bottom panels of figs .",
    "[ pes - ag ] and [ pes - au ] show the integrated ground - state occupancies of the projected gas - phase reference orbitals corresponding to the homo and lumo of azobenzene . for e - ab and z - ab as well as following geometries along the inversion degree of freedom no considerable charge is added to or withdrawn from these frontier orbitals on au(111 ) , cf . fig .",
    "[ pes - au ] on the right .",
    "this indicates that the bonding in these molecular geometries is mainly physisorptive .",
    "following the inversion isomerization of azobenzene on ag(111 ) , cf .",
    "[ pes - ag ] on the right , we obtain a very similar picture , although the z - ab isomer already shows some charge transfer in the ground state .",
    "in contrast , following rotation we see that on both surfaces around mid - rotation the lumo is more than half occupied and the homo loses considerable occupation .",
    "this is due to an orbital degeneracy of homo and lumo at this point , which exists independent of metal surface adsorption .",
    "this leads to the formation of a strongly chemisorbed species at this point , further rationalising the ground state barrier reduction .",
    "the shift of the z - ab minimum towards higher @xmath39 angles ( 44@xmath42 ) on ag(111 ) together with the significant population of the lumo creates a somewhat chemisorbed species in that case as well .",
    "the le@xmath0scf@xmath34 method calculates the first and second excited states of these surface systems by adding an electron to the region of hilbert space corresponding to the ab gas - phase lumo and removing an electron from homo or homo-1 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding excited - state curves , cf . figs .",
    "[ pes - ag ] and [ pes - au ] , for both degrees of freedom show very similar overall topologies compared to the respective gas - phase case . when following inversion on ag(111 ) and au(111 ) , the s1 state is almost unchanged in comparison to gas - phase azobenzene .",
    "a significant lowering of the excitation energy occurs only for geometries close to the z - ab minimum . for rotational isomerization ,",
    "s1 state energies around mid - rotation are reduced simultaneously with the barrier reduction in the ground state , while excitations close to the equilibrium geometries are almost unchanged .",
    "the systematic downshift of the s2 state corresponds to a shift of about 1 ev on both coinage metal surfaces all along the pathway , except around the mainly physisorbed e - ab geometry .",
    "two very important features for the isomerization mechanism in gas phase are the state - crossings between s0 and s1 at mid - rotation and between s1 and s2 close to the e - ab minimum . both can , in principle , still be observed , suggesting that an intra - molecular isomerization mechanism analogous to the gas phase could also prevail at the surface .    as most intriguing features of surface adsorption we thus see a stronger lowering of the s2 state compared to s1 , and a stronger lowering of excitations for all geometries away from the e - ab equilibrium structure .",
    "both effects can be rationalized by the interaction of the molecular dipole with the image charge that is induced in the underlying metal substrate during adsorption .",
    "azobenzene in the planar trans configuration shows no significant dipole orthogonal to the surface in the ground and both excited states . yet , following the isomerization pathways towards the non - planar z - ab isomer , the z - component of the dipole in the ground state increases significantly to a gas - phase value of 3.0 debye ( d ) .",
    "the corresponding excited - state dipole moments for gas - phase z - ab are 2.3 d and 4.3 d for s1 and s2 , respectively .",
    "the stronger polarisation of the s2 excited state thus leads to a stronger interaction of the molecular dipole with the image charge monopole and explains the particularly pronounced lowering of the s2 pes upon adsorption obtained in the le@xmath0scf@xmath34 calculations .",
    "an important point to mention here is that the variational treatment in le@xmath0scf and @xmath0scf approaches enables such an image charge build - up due to polarisation effects ( opposed to lrtd - dft treatments ) , although we emphasize that this is unlikely a quantitative account .",
    "another effect that modifies excited - state behaviour is the hybridization of molecular with surface states .",
    "a marker for the strength of hybridization is the change in ground - state occupation of the frontier orbitals , which we find much more pronounced for ab adsorbed on ag(111 ) than on au(111 ) . in regions where orbitals show occupancies very different from the gas phase , e.g. z - ab at ag(111 )",
    ", we obtain pes changes that are more significant than for regions where occupancies do not change drastically .",
    "this effect is especially strong around mid - rotation , where the ground - state occupation of the lumo already increases beyond one electron on both surfaces .",
    "this prohibits the full transfer of one further electron into the lumo in the le@xmath0scf@xmath34 excited - state calculations and we instead only perform these calculations by enforcing a full two - electron occupation of the lumo . in figs .",
    "[ pes - ag ] and [ pes - au ] we mark these regions with dashed lines to emphasize the expected increased uncertainty due to the concomitant violation of the excitation constraint .",
    "we believe that these parts of the s1 curves can only serve as an upper estimate to the actual pes topology and attest that such situations of strong hybridization and charge transfer represent a clear limitation to the le@xmath0scf approach .",
    ".[vertical ] vertical excitation energies ( in ev ) for the first singlet excited state of z - ab ( s1 ) and the second singlet excited state of e - ab ( s2 ) , as well as the difference between them .",
    "reference values shown are taken from experiments in solvent @xcite and from high - level quantum chemical ( ri - cc2 ) calculations for the isolated molecule @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notwithstanding , even when only taking them qualitatively , the obtained results clearly show that an explicit treatment of hybridization , charge transfer and image charge effects is necessary to appropriately describe ground- and excited - state pess of a functional molecule like azobenzene when adsorbed at metal surfaces .",
    "investigating ab in a van - der - waals potential to merely mimick the effect of surface - modified molecular geometries on the switching function , flo _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite recently reported only a small increase in conversion times and decrease of photo - yield compared to the gas phase , while otherwise the photo - isomerization was unaffected . without yet embarking on actual dynamical simulations , the le@xmath0scf - obtained pess topologies already indicate that much larger effects are induced by the metal electronic structure .",
    "notably this is the image charge induced lowering of excited - state pess , which due to the varying degree of state polarization and molecular dipole moment does not occur globally , but differentially `` skews '' individual state topologies and vertical excitation energies . for the present system this leads to a strong lowering of the s2 state particularly around the z - ab geometry .    by itself",
    "this image - charge lowering might already rationalize a significantly reduced switching efficiency of the traditional intra - molecular gas - phase isomerization mechanism at the surface : this mechanism proceeds via initial excitation to s2 and fast population transfer to s1 for the e@xmath36z isomerization , as transition to s1 is symmetry forbidden in the e - ab geometry .",
    "the back - reaction z@xmath36e instead involves direct excitation to s1 . in the gas phase",
    "the corresponding vertical excitation energies for the two reactions differ substantially ( cf . table [ vertical ] ) and allow the two isomerizations to be selectively induced by light with two largely differing wave lengths .",
    "in contrast , at the surface our le@xmath0scf@xmath34 results suggest that the selective image - charge induced s2 lowering reduces this difference for the two transitions substantially .",
    "while in the gas phase it amounts to more than 1ev , particularly at au(111 ) the difference between e - ab s2 and z - ab s1 reduces to 0.11 ev . considering an additional state broadening at the surface , this proximity of the two different excitations alone might then already cause a significant loss of switching efficiency via this intra - molecular mechanism as the forward and backward isomerization can simply no longer be selectively triggered .",
    "at least qualitatively , these findings should also be robust against the other clear limitation of le@xmath0scf , namely the one imposed by the employed approximate dft functional .",
    "already in the gas phase our preceding work demonstrated that gga - pbe based @xmath0scf ( but also gga - pbe based lrtd - dft ) severely underestimated absolute vertical excitation energies for azobenzene compared to accurate quantum - chemical ( ri - cc2 ) calculations @xcite .",
    "these were primarily global shifts of entire respective excited - state pess though and largely left topological features like barriers unchanged .",
    "addition of exact exchange can remedy these self - interaction induced shortcomings of the semi - local functional for gas - phase azobenzene @xcite .",
    "however , simultaneously it would remove much of the balanced error cancellation in the description of the metal substrate@xcite . for metal - surface adsorption",
    "there is at present no feasible and equally efficient alternative to semi - local dft .",
    "gga - pbe based le@xmath0scf excited - state pess thus have to be seen in light of the self - interaction induced overpolarizability and wrong relative positions of molecular and substrate states , which will affect the observed image charge and hybridization effects upon adsorption .",
    "while thus certainly not quantitative , the approach still enables in our view an effective first account of the electronic structure and charge distributions at the metal surface and is thus a viable means to generate further insight into the intricacies of surface functionality of large organic molecules like azobenzene .",
    "we presented an alternative implementation of the le@xmath0scf method of gavnholt _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and necessary modifications to allow its application to complex metal - surface adsorbed chemical reactions .",
    "the current method provides a computationally efficient way to describe low - lying localized excited states in large periodic systems .",
    "the correct calculation of reference states that are used to generate the resonances assures consistent quality of excited - state potential energy surfaces and also sets the connection to simple @xmath0scf in the limit of vanishing hybridization , in the surface context between adsorbate and metal substrate . for the example of photo - induced isomerization of azobenzene at ( 111 ) coinage metal surfaces we illustrated that the approach yields an account of the additional stabilization due the interaction of large excited - state dipoles with the substrate image charge and hybridization - induced state renormalization .",
    "as such the method at least qualitatively describes most important physical effects that arise from the interaction with the electronic structure and charge distributions at the metal surface , and thus allows to discuss surface effects on the molecular functionality beyond the level of surface - modified adsorbate geometries . for the azobenzene showcase system this is already highlighted by the observed unbalanced shifts of the intra - molecular excited - state energies of e - ab and z - ab , which leads to an alignment of isomerization - inducing resonances . reducing the ability to selectively trigger back and forth isomerization",
    ", this could be a first important piece in the puzzle to understand the strongly reduced isomerization efficiency at the surface - at least of the traditional gas - phase mechanism .",
    "we believe that the approach presented in this work , although approximate in nature , enables a semi - quantitative account of excited - state properties for large - scale systems and might prove to be very useful specifically for large hybrid organic / metallic interfaces .",
    "while it may never replace theoretically rigorous methods , such as td - dft or many - body perturbation theory , it fills a gap in the current methodological spectrum , where these more accurate methods are not yet applicable due to their computational expense or where currently used approximations in the xc - kernel or self - energy description in these methods cause a lack of consistent accuracy . independent from the development of these schemes there will always be the need for very efficient treatments that allow fast screening on a qualitative or , when solid benchmarking is done , possibly semi - quantitative level .",
