    "just as a 4-manifold can have many inequivalent smooth structures , there can be many different smooth embeddings of surfaces into a 4-manifold which are topologically isotopic , but smoothly distinct .",
    "two embeddings of the same surface that have this property are called _ exotic embeddings_.    in this paper",
    "we will show that null - homologous tori first discovered by fintushel and stern in their knot surgery construction , in fact provide examples of exotic tori . specifically ,    [ t : main ] let @xmath0 be a smooth 4-manifold with @xmath1 , non - trivial seiberg - witten invariant , and and embedded torus @xmath2 of self intersection 0 such that @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath0 contains an infinite family of distinct tori that are topologically isotopic to the unknotted torus ( a torus that bounds a solid handlebody in @xmath0 ) , but not smoothly isotopic to it .",
    "the first examples of exotic embeddings come from fintushel and stern s `` rim surgery '' technique @xcite .",
    "their surfaces all have simply connected complement . a variation on rim surgery",
    "was given by kim , and kim - ruberman which works in the case that the complement has non - trivial fundamental group ( @xcite ) .",
    "tom mark has used heegaard - floer homology to show that these constructions are also effective for constructing exotic embeddings of surfaces with negative self intersection ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "all of these constructions involve surfaces whose complement has finite first homology , and moreover all of these constructions essentially begin with symplectically embedded surfaces in a symplectic 4-manifold .",
    "such surfaces can never be null - homologous .",
    "the significance of our examples is that they are null - homologous .",
    "it is not difficult to satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem .",
    "for example , any elliptic surface contains such a torus and has non - trivial seiberg - witten invariant by virtue of being a symplectic manifold .",
    "the strategy of proof is as follows : the knot surgery construction of fintushel and stern produces an infinite family of exotic smooth structures on a 4-manifold through a series of log - transforms on null - homologous tori .",
    "these are the tori we will focus on .",
    "we will define a gauge theoretic invariant to distinguish the tori smoothly .",
    "finally , we will show that all such tori are topologically isotopic by a theorem of the second author :    [ t : iso ] let @xmath4 and @xmath5 be locally flat embedded surfaces of the same genus in a simply connected 4-manifold @xmath0 .",
    "the surfaces are topologically isotopic when @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ".    presumably if the surfaces are smooth , then the surfaces are topologically isotopic without the condition that @xmath7 .",
    "if one could show that , then one could similarly drop that condition from theorem [ t : main ] . on the other hand , for locally flat surfaces",
    "this condition is necessary .",
    "examples can be derived from @xcite and @xcite wherein topological 4-manifolds are constructed with infinite cyclic fundamental group that are not connected sums with @xmath8 . in their examples , surgery on a loop generating @xmath9 will result in a surface in @xmath10 that has cyclic fundamental group . however",
    ", this surface can not be topologically isotopic to the trivial one , because surgery on the trivial surface results in a manifold which is a connect sum with @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , such a surface can not be smoothly embedded , otherwise it would be possible to smooth the original topological 4-manifold it was derived from .",
    "also , one might wonder how robust these exotic embeddings are .",
    "that is , what does it take to make any of the exotically embedded topologically trivial surfaces constructed here smoothly equivalent again ? in @xcite , inanc baykur and the second author show that these tori become smoothly equivalent once one increases the genus of each of these surfaces in the most trivial possible way .",
    "namely , tubing any one of the topologically trivial surfaces of theorem 1.1 with a smoothly trivial surface results in a smoothly trivial surface .",
    "we conclude this introduction with an open question .    do their exist exotically embedded surfaces in @xmath11 ?",
    "in particular , is there an embedded @xmath12 that is topologically isotopic to the unknot but not smoothly isotopic to the unknot ?    if one could produce such an exotic unknot , its complement would be an exotic @xmath13 , and surgery along it would be an exotic @xmath8 , two of the most elusive exotic creatures .",
    "the examples in this paper can be seen as prototypes for answering this sort of question : since the tori we construct bound solid handlebodies in @xmath0 , they are close to being exotic surfaces in @xmath11 in the sense that they are topologically isotopic to a surface lying in a ball in @xmath0 .",
    "* acknowledgements : * both authors would like to thank the max planck institute for mathematics for hosting them while they worked on this project , and danny ruberman and tom mark for their comments on an early draft of this paper .",
    "let @xmath2 be an embedded torus with self intersection zero in a 4-manifold @xmath0 such that @xmath3 .",
    "such a torus is necessarily homologically essential",
    ". we will not construct exotic embeddings of @xmath2 , but rather we will find exotic embeddings of nearby null - homologous tori which arise in the `` knot surgery '' construction of fintushel and stern ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "knot surgery along torus @xmath2 using a knot @xmath14 is most straightforwardly defined as @xmath15 where the union is formed by taking the longitude of @xmath16 to the meridian of @xmath2 ( apart from this requirement , the gluing is not , strictly speaking , well defined , but this is in general irrelevant ) .",
    "fintushel and stern proved that @xmath0 is homeomorphic to @xmath17 under the assumption that the complement of @xmath2 is simply connected , and they further proved that their seiberg - witten invariants are related by @xmath18)$ ] where @xmath19 is the alexander polynomial for @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , by varying @xmath16 , one can construct infinitely many smooth structures on @xmath0 .",
    "the seiberg - witten formula is proved by viewing knot surgery as a series of log - transforms on null - homologous tori .",
    "that is , rather than cutting out @xmath20 and replacing it with @xmath21 , we can view knot surgery as a series of log - transforms in @xmath22 which eventually lead to @xmath21 . forgetting the extra @xmath23 direction for the moment , one can go from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , the complement of the unknot , by doing @xmath26 surgery along crossings of @xmath16 to unknot it .",
    "see figure [ f : knotsurgery ] .",
    "crossing this whole picture with @xmath23 gives the log - transforms needed for knot surgery .    at 168 140 at 260 82 at 18 29   + 1 surgery on @xmath27 unknots @xmath16.,title=\"fig : \" ]    suppose for the moment , that @xmath16 is a knot of unknotting number 1 .",
    "then knot surgery is equivalent to a single log - transform on a null homologous torus @xmath27 .",
    "as long as the complement of @xmath2 is simply connected , then @xmath27 will have @xmath28 .",
    "this is because @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the meridian and longitude of @xmath16 .",
    "this implies that that all loops are homotopic to a multiple of the meridian to @xmath27 .    already we see that this gives at least one exotically embedded torus .",
    "specifically , @xmath27 is topologically standard by theorem [ t : iso ] , and moreover , performing a log - transform on @xmath27 will give an exotic smooth structure on @xmath0 , whereas performing a log - transform on the standardly embedded torus , ( i.e. the one that bounds a solid handlebody ) , will not .",
    "therefore these tori are smoothly distinct , but by theorem [ t : iso ] they must be topologically isotopic .    to construct infinite families of exotic surfaces , we need to be more careful .",
    "for instance , supposing that @xmath32 is the @xmath33-th twist knot , it might be possible to construct @xmath34 for any @xmath33 via some log - transform on @xmath27 .",
    "( the effect of @xmath35-log transforms on @xmath27 is explored in @xcite . ) in other words , it is not always straightforward to distinguish the exotic tori that arise from different knots . to resolve this issue , we have to look more deeply at how the seiberg - witten invariant changes under log - transforms on @xmath27 , and restrict ourselves to certain classes of knots .",
    "the seiberg - witten invariant of a 4-manifold @xmath0 is a map @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the set of isomorphism classes of @xmath38 structures on @xmath0 .",
    "the _ basic classes _ of @xmath0 are defined to be the @xmath38 structures that map to non - zero integers .",
    "it is a well known property of the seiberg - witten invariant that a closed 4-manifold has only a finite number of basic classes .",
    "below , we will often not distinguish between a @xmath38 structure and its first chern class or even the poincare dual of its first chern class .",
    "we will distinguish our null - homologous tori by computing an invariant that is , in a technical sense clarified below , related to the seiberg - witten basic classes of the complement of the tori . to do this",
    "we will need to understand how the seiberg - witten invariant of a 4-manifold is affected by log - transforms .",
    "suppose we are given a 4-manifold with @xmath39 boundary , e.g. @xmath40 , and suppose @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "denote the log - transformed 4-manifold constructed by gluing on a @xmath42 , where @xmath43 $ ] is glued to @xmath44 $ ] as @xmath45 , and denote the core torus in the @xmath42 part of this manifold as @xmath46 .",
    "a formula of morgan - mrowka - szabo from @xcite give a formula relating the seiberg - witten invariants of various log - transforms :    @xmath47 ) = p\\sum_i   sw_{x_{t}(1,0,0)}(k_{(1,0,0 ) } + i[t_{(1,0,0 ) } ] ) \\\\   & + q\\sum_i sw_{x_{t}(0,1,0)}(k_{(0,1,0 ) } + i[t_{(0,1,0 ) } ] ) + r\\sum_i sw_{x_{t}(0,0,1)}(k_{(0,0,1 ) } + i[t_{(0,0,1 ) } ] )   \\label{e : eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the @xmath48 are @xmath38 structures that are equivalent on @xmath49 and are trivial on the log - transformed torus @xmath50 .",
    "the sums here are intended to indicate summing over all @xmath38 structures on @xmath51 which restrict to @xmath48 on @xmath52 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath46 is null - homologous , then the left hand side of the equation has only one term .",
    "moreover , since there are a finite number ( not depending on @xmath53 ) of @xmath54 such that the sum @xmath55)$ ] is not zero ( respectively for @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) , then according to the mms formula there is a fixed , finite number of homology classes that can be basic classes for @xmath58 in the case that @xmath46 is null - homologous . to put this another way , there are only a finite number of @xmath38 structures on @xmath40 that can be extended to basic classes on @xmath58 when @xmath59=0 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the following invariant is well defined :    let @xmath2 be a null - homologous torus in @xmath0 . define @xmath60 to be the maximum divisibility of the difference between any two basic classes of @xmath61 for any @xmath53 such that @xmath59 = 0 $ ] .",
    "now that we have a better understanding of the smooth invariants needed to distinguish potential infinite families of smooth tori , we can describe an explicit family of knots that will give rise to smoothly distinct @xmath27 . for the purposes of this paper",
    ", it will be sufficient to focus on a nice family of two - bridge knots .",
    "all two - bridge knots can be given in the form of figure [ f : twobridge ] where @xmath62 is the number of right half - twists when @xmath33 is odd , and left half - twists when @xmath33 is even .",
    "we refer to two - bridge knots using conway s notation , @xmath63 , and we note that it is well known ( see @xcite for instance ) , that two 2-bridge knots are equivalent if and only if @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] are continued fraction expansions of the same rational number .",
    "the following proposition of burde - zieschang is stated in terms of our convention for presenting two - bridge knots as in the figure [ f : twobridge ] . the two - bridge knot diagram in figure [ f : twobridge ]",
    "can be converted to a 4-plat diagram in burde - zieschang by pulling the inner strand on the right hand side of the figure over the outer strand .",
    "this has the effect of adding a new crossing ( i.e. @xmath67 ) and adjusting @xmath68 by @xmath69 .        combining propositions [ p : unknotprop ] and [ p : conwayprop ] shows that there exists an infinite family of two - bridge knots of unknotting number one such that the conway polynomial has arbitrarily high degree .",
    "the lemma is thus immediate from the fact that the conway polynomial is related to the alexander polynomial by the formula @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 be a sequence of knots of unknotting number 1 such that the degree of their alexander polynomials goes to infinity , and let @xmath74 be the associated ( topologically trivial ) tori from section [ s : constructing ] ."
