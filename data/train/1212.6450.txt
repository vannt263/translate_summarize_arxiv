    "this paper studies the _ reach control problem _ ( rcp ) on simplices .",
    "the problem is for trajectories of an affine system defined on a simplex to reach a prespecified facet of the simplex in finite time .",
    "the overall concept of the problem and its setting were introduced in @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "the significance of the problem stems from its capturing the essential features of reachability problems for control systems : the presence of state constraints and the notion of trajectories reaching a goal in a guided and finite - time manner .",
    "the problem fits within a larger family of reachability problems ; namely , to reach a target set @xmath0 with state constraint in a set @xmath1 , denoted as @xmath2 . in the present context ,",
    "we assume that the state constraints give rise to a state space that is triangulable @xcite ; then the reachability specification is converted to a sequence of reachability problems on simplices of the triangulation .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for further motivations , including how the studied problem arises in fundamental problems concerning hybrid systems @xcite .",
    "rcp is one among several different research paths for analysis and synthesis of piecewise affine ( pwa ) feedback @xcite .",
    "recent progress on explicit mpc schemes has fueled the interest in pwa feedbacks @xcite , such feedbacks play a prominent role in linear switched systems @xcite , and pwa systems have significant applications in engineering and biology @xcite .",
    "a feature of our approach is that , rather than directly computing a controller numerically , we seek conditions for existence of controllers based on the problem data .",
    "this follows classical lines of thought which are well established in control theory .",
    "another classical underpinning is to exploit system structure to understand the limits of a control system , again distinguishing our approach from numerical methods .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that , under a suitable triangulation of the state space , affine feedback and continuous state feedback are equivalent from the point of view of solvability of the reach control problem ( rcp ) .",
    "the approach is based , fundamentally , on fixed point theory .",
    "the latter allows to deduce that continuous state feedbacks always generate closed - loop equilibria inside the simplex when affine feedbacks do .",
    "the current paper departs from these findings , and using a geometric approach , we explore the system structure that gives rise to equilibria .",
    "this structure is encoded in so - called _ reach control indices_. the first goal of this paper is to elucidate these indices .",
    "the second goal is to use the indices to obtain a subdivision of the simplex and an associated piecewise affine feedback to solve rcp in those cases when the problem is not solvable by continuous state feedback .",
    "it is shown that rcp is solvable by piecewise affine feedback if it is solvable by open - loop controls .",
    "this finding gives strong evidence to the relevance of the class of piecewise affine feedbacks in solving reachability problems .",

    "the _ reach control problem _ is to find a state feedback @xmath22 such that all closed - loop trajectories initialized in @xmath3 leave @xmath3 in finite time through the _ exit facet _ @xmath14 . the procedure to solve this control problem by continuous state feedback is to select control values @xmath23 at the vertices @xmath24 such that the velocity vectors @xmath25 point inside @xmath18 , the cone with apex at @xmath8 determined by @xmath3 ; otherwise trajectories may leave @xmath3 through @xmath15 or @xmath16 , which is disallowed .",
    "the controller @xmath26 is formed as a continuous interpolation of the control values at the vertices . label the vertex velocity vectors as @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , as in the figure .",
    "suppose that @xmath30 along a line @xmath17 through @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    ", @xmath12 has to point down to be inside @xmath18 , but at @xmath10 , @xmath13 has to point up .",
    "if we continuously interpolate along @xmath14 from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , the continuous vector field , always in @xmath32 along @xmath14 , must pass through zero ( by the intermediate value theorem ) at some @xmath6 along @xmath14 .",
    "the defect is that there are two vertices @xmath9 and @xmath10 that `` share '' the only control direction available , @xmath33 .",
    "suppose we now allow discontinuous feedback .",
    "place a point @xmath7 along the edge from @xmath8 to @xmath9 and define a new simplex @xmath34 . see figure  [ fig0](b ) .",
    "notice that as we slide @xmath7 from @xmath8 to @xmath9 the cone @xmath19 with apex at @xmath7 widens at @xmath10 enough that @xmath35 points inside @xmath19 at @xmath10 .",

    "rcp is solved on @xmath4 . for the remaining simplex @xmath5",
    "it is also possible to devise an affine controller so there is no equilibrium in @xmath5 .",
    "this is because equilibria can only appear in @xmath5 at @xmath37 .",

    "again rcp can be solved on @xmath5 by affine feedback . combining the two affine feedbacks",
    ", we get a discontinuous piecewise affine feedback that solves rcp on @xmath3 .",
    "note that a discontinuity is introduced because we use two different control values at @xmath10 .",
    "the contribution of the paper is to make mathematically rigorous the informal ideas described above .",
    "the main technical difficulty arises in dealing with multi - input systems . for this we bring in two tools .",
    "first we introduce the reach control indices to group together vertices in @xmath39 that share control inputs .",
    "these indices are similar in spirit to the controllability indices to group together states that share control inputs @xcite . as with the controllability indices , the reach control indices require a special ordering of a set of linearly independent vectors ; however , other technical details are different .",
    "the second tool is @xmath40-matrices which help to concisely represent the constraints on the vector field at vertices of @xmath39 .",
    "the reader is referred to chapter 6 of @xcite for relevant background .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : back ] we review the reach control problem . in section  [ sec : necessary ] we give necessary conditions for solvability by open - loop controls .",
    "these then shape the assumptions to construct the reach control indices , which are developed in section  [ sec : indices ] . in section  [ sec : pwa ] , a subdivision method and associated piecewise affine feedback are proposed to solve rcp when continuous state feedback does not .",
