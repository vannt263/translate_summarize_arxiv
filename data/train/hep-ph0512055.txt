    "understanding the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is a primary goal of the fermilab tevatron , cern lhc and the proposed ilc . in the standard model ( sm ) of high energy physics ,",
    "ewsb is realized via a weak - doublet fundamental higgs field .",
    "after ewsb spontaneously , namely higgs field acquiring a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , only one neutral higgs boson is left in particle spectrum .",
    "the higgs boson mass is theoretical unknown within the sm . therefore searching all mass region is necessary and great efforts have been put on it since the establishment of the sm . the latest direct search at lep sets the lower bound of sm higgs boson of @xmath12 gev at 95% confidence level ( cl ) @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson can also affect electro - weak observables through radiative corrections",
    ". therefore precise measurements of these observables can predict the higgs boson mass .",
    "studies show that data from lep , sld and tevatron are in good agreement with sm predictions . anomalies @xcite may indicate new dynamics beyond the sm , moreover even without these anomalies the global fit shows certain tension with direct search limit at lep @xcite . ] based on the global fit of those data , the higgs boson mass is predicted to be @xmath13 gev and @xmath14 gev at 95% cl using latest preliminary top quark mass @xmath15 gev @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson decay width in the sm varies dramatically within the experiments preferable mass region @xmath16 gev .",
    "for example , for @xmath7 gev , @xmath17 mev while for @xmath18 gev , @xmath19 gev @xcite .",
    "the tiny decay width for light higgs ( @xmath20 ) is due to the suppressed coupling among higgs boson and fermion which is proportional to @xmath21 with @xmath22 the light fermion mass .",
    "therefore the _ light _",
    "higgs boson ( @xmath20 ) can possibly decay into non - sm particles with large branching ratio .",
    "for example the higgs boson may decay dominantly into scalar dark matter in the simplest cold dark matter model @xcite .",
    "study of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the correct cold dark matter relic abundance within @xmath23 uncertainty ( @xmath24 ) and experimentally allowed higgs boson mass ( @xmath25 gev ) constrain the scalar dark matter mass within @xmath26 gev .",
    "this result is in excellent agreement with that of w.  de boer et.al .",
    "( @xmath27 gev ) @xcite .",
    "such kind of dark matter annihilation can account for the observed gamma rays excess ( @xmath28 ) at egret for energies above 1 gev in comparison with the expectations from conventional galactic models .",
    "the most important phenomenological consequence of this model is that the higgs boson decays dominantly into scalar cold dark matter if its mass lies within @xmath29 gev . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath30 mev scalar dark matter was proposed to account for the observation of a 511 kev bright @xmath31-ray line from the galactic bulge @xcite . from theoretical point of view , containing a stable singlet scalar which interacts possibly with sm higgs boson , is a generic feature of models of scalar dark matter @xcite . in other models beyond the sm , it is not rare that the higgs boson can decay into dark matter .",
    "for example in supersymmetical models with r - parity , the higgs boson can decay into pair of neutralino if kinematically allowed .",
    "another reason why light higgs boson is especially interesting is due to the aspect of experiments .",
    "it is known for a long time that hadronic asymmetry measurements , namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 prefer the heavier higgs mass with central value around 400 gev , while the leptonic ones , @xmath34,@xmath35 and @xmath36 prefer the very light higgs which already indicates certain tension with direct search limit 114.4 gev @xcite .",
    "while such situation maybe totally due to statistical fluctuations , it is not unreasonable to suspect that some unknown systematic errors lie in hadronic asymmetry measurements .",
    "if this is true , the sm higgs boson tends to lie just above the current direct search limit , otherwise the tension will become stronger .    in this paper we will study invisible higgs boson in @xmath37 associated production channel in which higgs boson decays _ invisibly _",
    ", i.e. we ca nt tag higgs decay products , and @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the signal is @xmath40 where @xmath1 is reconstructed from the @xmath2 .",
    "this channel has been widely discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "as one of the characteristics of this mode , we ca nt get higgs boson invariant mass peak out of continuum background .",
    "therefore it is quite interesting to know how to get higgs boson mass information from the experimental measurements . as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , this process may provide an interesting handle on the higgs boson mass at lhc .",
    "the higgs mass can be extracted from the production cross section and the uncertainty is 35 - 50 gev ( 15 - 20 gev ) with integrated luminosity @xmath41 at lhc @xcite .",
    "can reduce the largest zz background , and it may also improve the higgs mass determination . ] therefore , precise understanding of backgrounds is essential . at hadron",
    "colliders the precise predictions for backgrounds are commonly thought difficult because of uncertainty in parton distribution function ( pdf ) , large qcd radiative corrections etc .",
    "however for this channel , we only care about charged leptons final states , and the backgrounds seem to be less severe than those of hadronic final states .",
    "another interesting question is how to suppress background efficiently . in literature , lots of techniques are proposed @xcite .",
    "however the largest irreducible zz background , with one z decays into neutrinos and the other charged lepton pair , ca nt be eliminated by kinematical cuts . in this paper",
    ", we will propose a method , i.e. utilizing the precise measurement of @xmath42 , to reduce the largest irreducible zz background .",
    "in this paper , we consider the production of higgs boson in association with a @xmath43 boson , and higgs decays 100% invisibly",
    ". therefore the signal is : @xmath44    as the signal is @xmath40 where @xmath1 is reconstructed from the @xmath2 , the most significant sources of background are @xmath45 with the lepton ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and only here we consider @xmath47 lepton ) from the @xmath48 decay in @xmath49 missed , and @xmath50 final states with fake @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "we simulate the signal and the three backgrounds in eq .",
    "( [ bkg ] ) using pythia @xcite without initial and final qcd and qed radiation corrections . in order to reduce the fake @xmath1 background to an insignificant level",
    ", we set @xmath51 gev for lhc @xcite and @xmath52 gev for tevatron @xcite .",
    "we adopt the following `` lhc cuts '' from @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes pseudo - rapidity and @xmath55 is the separation between the two particles in the detector , @xmath56 ; @xmath57 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "the @xmath58 background can be largely eliminated by @xmath59 in order to reduce the third background in eq .",
    "( [ bkg ] ) , we veto events with @xmath60    at tevatron we adopt the following `` tevatron cuts '' from @xcite : @xmath61 and veto events with @xmath62    the signal and background are shown in fig . 1 and 2 as a function of @xmath1 for @xmath63 final states at tevatron and lhc .",
    "our results are consistent with those of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .    after imposing cuts in eqs .",
    "( [ lhc1]-[tev3 ] ) , the remaining largest irreducible background is zz , as shown in fig . 1 and 2 .",
    "this background can not be eliminated via kinematical cuts .",
    "therefore we propose to utilize the measurement of @xmath64 ( in short @xmath65 hereafter ) to reduce this background .",
    "this idea is quite natural because of two reasons .",
    "the first one is that @xmath65 is almost background free@xcite luminosity at lhc , @xmath66 can act as the background to @xmath67 especially for heavier higgs , say 140 gev",
    ". however we can apply invariant mass cut to eliminate such kind of background .",
    "] due to the excellent leptonic reconstruction efficiency and mass resolution of z boson ( decays to a pair of charged leptons ) .",
    "for example with integrated luminosity 30 @xmath68 cross section of this channel can be measured to an accuracy of @xmath69 at lhc @xcite .",
    "the second reason is that zz background and @xmath67 share almost the same kinematics , the same higher order qcd radiative correction and pdf uncertainties , as well as the uncertainty of luminosity etc .",
    "we can then get improved zz background by subtracting contributions from @xmath67 @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the cross section for @xmath72 with each pair of leptons satisfying `` lhc cuts '' or `` tevatron cuts '' in eqs .",
    "( [ lhc1]-[tev3 ] ) .",
    "actually @xmath73 event does not have missing @xmath74 if we run through all the final state particles .",
    "however in our case @xmath1 is reconstructed via the momentum of charged lepton pair , invariance mass of which is effectively around @xmath75 .",
    "thus @xmath73 is the extra data set which is not included in that of @xmath76 .",
    "note that the purity of @xmath72 is the most crucial factor for the subtraction purpose .",
    "thus besides `` lhc cuts '' or `` tevatron cuts '' ( e.g. invariance mass of each pair is effectively around @xmath75 ) , we can further require that missing @xmath74 of four leptons should be small , in order to guarantee that they do come from @xmath77 .",
    "the detail study of @xmath72 can be found in ref . @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ sub ] ) @xmath78 is the ratio defined as @xmath79 it is obvious that @xmath80 if we can measure all 4 charged lepton final states in any kinematical region . though this ratio at tree level can be expressed as , omitting the final state lepton mass , @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the higher order radiative corrections can be included by replacing the couplings @xmath84 and @xmath85 by the effective ones . in this paper",
    "we alternatively adopt the experimental central values as input : @xmath86 mev and @xmath87 mev @xcite , and get @xmath88    in fig . 1 and 2",
    ", we also show the @xmath1 distribution for @xmath89 process ( in fact , one can reconstruct two equal @xmath1 based on two pair of leptons , and invariant mass of each lepton pair is around z mass peak ) . the shape of zz",
    "background and @xmath72 process is very similar and the difference represents the incomplete cancelation due to the kinematical cuts on charged leptons .",
    "our results for the background and signal cross sections are tabulated in table  [ table1 ] for tevatron and [ table2 ] for lhc . the corresponding signal to background ratio , @xmath90 , and significance , @xmath91 ,",
    "are tabulated in table  [ table3 ] for tevatron and [ table4 ] for lhc .    .",
    "background and signal cross sections for associated @xmath92 production at the tevatron , combining the @xmath93 and @xmath94 channels . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from table  [ table1]-[table4 ] , we can see that zz background is greatly eliminated after including the measurement of @xmath95 .",
    "accordingly @xmath90 and @xmath96 are improved significantly . at tevatron , for @xmath7 gev and with luminosity @xmath8 , over @xmath9 observation of higgs boson is possible through this channel , while one can only achieve the significance less than @xmath97 without input from measurement of @xmath95 . for the heavier higgs mass even for @xmath98 gev",
    ", this channel can yield a signal of @xmath23 significance with @xmath8 luminosity .",
    "at lhc , our results show that for 114 - 140 gev higgs boson and with only @xmath11 luminosity , this channel can provide over @xmath9 significance observation of invisible higgs boson .",
    "in this paper we studied the invisible higgs boson at fermilab tevatron and cern lhc , i.e. @xmath99 , where @xmath1 is reconstructed from the @xmath2 with @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , in order to reduce the largest @xmath100 background , we propose to utilize precise measurement of @xmath101 as input .",
    "our study shows that at tevatron , for @xmath7 gev and with luminosity @xmath8 , over @xmath9 observation of higgs boson is possible via this channel . at lhc , for 114 - 140 gev higgs boson and with only @xmath11 luminosity , this channel can achieve over @xmath9 discovery .",
    "we should note that the feasibility of this discovery mode depends crucially on the understanding of the backgrounds .",
    "therefore the simulation incorporated with at least nlo qcd radiative correction for signal @xcite and background @xcite is very important and will put the analysis on a firmer ground .",
    "moreover we are aware that the simulation presented here is very rough and the full detector simulation , which is beyond the scope of this paper , is the natural further investigation .",
    "it is worth to mention that invisible higgs boson can also be investigated through weak boson fusion ( wbf ) provided that events with two energetic forward - backward jets of high dijet invariant mass and with substantial missing transverse momentum can be triggered efficiently @xcite .",
    "the study shows that it is possible to discover invisible higgs boson with masses up to 480 gev at the 5 sigma level if the invisible branching ratio is close to 100% @xcite . while wbf can detect invisible higgs boson with higher mass",
    ", the @xmath37 channel may provide a better handle on the mass determination @xcite . moreover",
    "the combined analysis of wbf and @xmath37 modes allows a relatively model - independent determination of invisible higgs boson mass .",
