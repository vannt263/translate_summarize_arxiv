    "one of the most important global features of a discrete - time dynamical system ( or map ) is that of a homoclinic connection .",
    "homoclinic connections are given by intersections between the stable and unstable manifolds of an invariant set and are central to our understanding of chaos .",
    "if the intersections are transverse , then they are not broken by small perturbations to the map .",
    "for this reason , transverse homoclinic connections are robust structures .",
    "their existence implies the presence of a smale horseshoe , infinitely many unstable periodic orbits , and chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "as the parameters of a smooth map are varied , transverse homoclinic connections can be created ( or destroyed ) in homoclinic tangencies . here , stable and unstable manifolds intersect tangentially .",
    "a homoclinic tangency is a codimension - one phenomenon , thus to understand the nature of the dynamics associated with the tangency as the system is perturbed , it suffices to vary a single parameter .    in the simplest",
    "setting : that the invariant set is a saddle fixed point of a two - dimensional map , these dynamics were first studied rigorously in @xcite .",
    "the simplest nearby bifurcations are those of single - round periodic solutions ( involving one excursion away from the fixed point ) .",
    "these bifurcations are described by a one - dimensional quadratic map through the process of renormalisation .",
    "the single - round periodic solutions can be asymptotically stable , but sufficiently close to a non - degenerate homoclinic tangency , asymptotically stable single - round periodic solutions do not coexist .",
    "other invariant sets exist near homoclinic tangencies , such as multi - round periodic solutions , and indeed the complete bifurcation structure is fractal @xcite .",
    "attractors may coexist , and infinitely many attractors coexist on parameter sets known as newhouse regions @xcite .    in more than two dimensions ,",
    "only the slowest stable and unstable directions about the saddle fixed point are important to the dynamics .",
    "this is because almost all forward orbits that approach the fixed point do so tangent to the slowest stable direction , and almost all backward orbits that approach the fixed point asymptotically do so tangent to the slowest unstable direction .",
    "thus if the eigenvalues associated with these directions are real and of multiplicity one , then as in the two - dimensional case the renormalised dynamics are described by a one - dimensional quadratic map .",
    "cases involving complex eigenvalues lead to different maps , and it has been shown that four maps suffice to describe all possible scenarios @xcite .    various types of degenerate homoclinic tangencies have been studied .",
    "cubic and other higher - order tangencies yield a similar basic bifurcation structure @xcite .",
    "a degeneracy in the global reinjection mechanism allows for the existence of infinitely many elliptic single - round periodic solutions in area - preserving maps @xcite . for a codimension - two scenario at which the branches of the stable and unstable manifolds that intersect are coincident , an unfolding reveals single - round periodic solutions existing between pairs of saddle - node bifurcations @xcite",
    "a codimension - three homoclinic tangency corresponding to a shilnikov - hopf bifurcation is unfolded in @xcite . also , for piecewise - smooth maps , homoclinic connections can be created in homoclinic corners @xcite .",
    "this paper concerns piecewise - linear maps that are continuous but non - differentiable on a codimension - one manifold termed the switching manifold .",
    "the global dynamics of such maps describe the local dynamics of border - collision bifurcations @xcite .",
    "such dynamics can involve multiple attractors @xcite .",
    "this paper builds on a result of @xcite for such maps in two dimensions .",
    "there it was shown that , under certain conditions , if the map has infinitely many stable single - round periodic solutions , then it must have a particular coincident homoclinic connection that is codimension - three . as the map is perturbed from this codimension - three scenario , the number of coexisting attractors scales with @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the size of the parameter change and @xmath3 is the associated stable eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "examples with the same underlying mechanism had been given earlier in an area - preserving scenario @xcite and for a three - component piecewise - smooth map @xcite .",
    "in this paper the result of @xcite is extended to @xmath0-dimensions ( theorem [ th : homoclinic ] ) . here",
    "the unstable manifold is again one - dimensional , but the stable manifold is now @xmath4-dimensional .",
    "branches of the stable and unstable manifolds therefore can not be coincident .",
    "instead we find that one branch of the unstable manifold is contained within the stable manifold  we say it is _",
    "subsumed_. we also provide a converse result ( theorem [ th : infinity ] ) showing that , under certain conditions , the presence of a subsumed homoclinic connection , as characterised using an orbit with two points on the switching manifold , implies the existence of infinitely many asymptotically stable single - round periodic solutions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : symbolic ] we introduce a general piecewise - linear continuous map @xmath5 and explain how orbits and periodic solutions of @xmath5 are encoded symbolically .",
    "we also characterise the stability and admissibility of periodic solutions and provide a simple result regarding line segments .",
    "in  [ sec : symhc ] we provide rationale for the assumptions placed upon the symbolic itineraries in theorems [ th : infinity ] and [ th : homoclinic ] .",
    "this is achieved by investigating the consequences that an orbit @xmath6 , homoclinic to an @xmath7-cycle ( periodic solution with itinerary @xmath7 ) is of a simple type .",
    "then in  [ sec : subsumed ] we show that if the dimension of the unstable manifold of the @xmath7-cycle is one and @xmath6 has two particular points on the switching manifold of @xmath5 , then , under certain conditions , the @xmath7-cycle has a subsumed homoclinic connection , proposition [ pr : subsumed ] . in  [ sec : thms ] we then state and discuss theorems [ th : infinity ] and [ th : homoclinic ] .",
    "in  [ sec : examples ] we explain how the codimension - three scenario can be identified numerically in a map with at least three parameters and provide three specific examples using the three - dimensional border - collision normal form .",
    "theorems [ th : infinity ] and [ th : homoclinic ] are then proved in  [ sec : proofs ] using a slew of algebraic , analytical , and geometric arguments .",
    "the over - riding strategy is to work in a coordinate system centred about one point of the @xmath7-cycle and with axes that at least partially align with the stable and unstable subspaces of the @xmath7-cycle .",
    "finally  [ sec : conc ] provides a summary and outlook for future studies .",
