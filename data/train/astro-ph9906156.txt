    "most studies of structure formation in the universe start from the assumption that the primordial perturbations were gaussian .",
    "many well motivated models , however , predict non - gaussian fluctuations , including topological defect models ( kibble 1976 ; vilenkin & shellard 1994 ) , and certain forms of inflation ( peebles 1983,1997,1998a,1998b ; la 1991 ; amendola & occhionero 1993 ; amendola & borgani 1994 ) .",
    "one area which has recently received a considerable degree of attention in the gaussian case is the evolution of the galaxy cluster number abundance .",

    "; viana & liddle 1999 ) have shown how cluster evolution data can be used to constrain the matter density of the universe under the assumption of gaussianity , with most studies favoring a low density universe .",
    "some attempts have been made to extend studies of cluster formation to the non - gaussian case .",
    "oukbir , bartlett & blanchard ( 1997 ) noted the existence of a degeneracy between the spectral index of the primordial fluctuations and primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "colafrancesco , lucchin & matarrese ( 1989 ) , and later chiu , ostriker & strauss ( 1997 ) have introduced a modified version of the press - schechter ( 1974 ) formalism to make predictions for the cluster number density in a non - gaussian model , and robinson , gawiser and silk ( 1998 , hereafter rgs98 ) have generalized this approach .",
    "robinson & baker ( 2000 , hereafter rb00 ) have tested this formalism and verified that it is able to accurately fit the evolution of the cluster number abundance observed in n - body simulations of structure formation with non - gaussian initial conditions .",
    "various authors ( rgs98 ; van de bruck 1998 ; koyama , soda & taruya 1999 ) have used this formalism to study the evolution and clustering properties of galaxy clusters and thus constrain non - gaussianity in the primordial fluctuations .",
    "willick ( 1999 ) has considered the constraints on non - gaussianity which can be derived from the existence of cluster ms1054 - 03 at a redshift @xmath5 . in this paper , we extend previous work by carrying out a detailed study of cluster evolution in the non - gaussian case , performing a bayesian likelihood analysis , considering a number of different cluster observations , and accounting for a wide range of possible sources of systematic error .",
    "our results demonstrate that given an independent measurement of the matter density of the universe ( which we can realistically expect to gain in the near future from cmb and supernovae observations ) , cluster evolution data can place strong constraints on non - gaussianity .",
    "the greatest strength of our analysis is that it uses observations to place direct constraints on non - gaussianity ( in particular , on the probability distribution function , or pdf , of the primordial density field ) , without any reference to the details of the non - gaussian physics in specific models . because of the infinite range of possible non - gaussian models and the difficulties in making accurate predictions even in well specified cases , the model independent constraints on non - gaussianity considered here are therefore particularly powerful . in section  [ sec - models ]",
    "we discuss the parameterization of our models and the process of predicting the cluster number density at different redshifts . in section  [ sec - data ]",
    "we discuss the different datasets used in our analysis and our method for computing the likelihood of observing a dataset given one of our models . in section  [ sec - results ]",
    "we discuss the resulting constraints on non - gaussianity from existing cluster data , the likely sources of systematic error , and the improvement we can hope to gain from future data . in section  [ sec - conclusions ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "the models we consider are specified by knowledge of the power spectrum of the fluctuations , the nature of the non - gaussianity , the background cosmology , and the cluster mass - temperature relationship .",
    "we discuss the parameterization of these properties in the following subsections .",
    "we parameterize the power spectrum @xmath6 for each model using a cold dark matter ( cdm ) form ( bond et al .",
    "1991 ) , that is @xmath7 where @xmath8 ^{-1/4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the shape parameter ( which is well fit by @xmath11 for both open and flat cdm models , where @xmath4 is the contribution of cdm and baryons to the critical density at @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the contribution of the baryons , and the hubble constant is parameterized via @xmath14 km s@xmath15mpc@xmath15 ) .",
    "although this form is derived within the context of the cdm model , it can also be used to fit power spectra from a range of structure formation scenarios , at least over the range of scales relevant to cluster formation .",
    "as we will see later , our results are quite insensitive to the value of @xmath10 , suggesting that a more precise parameterization of the power spectrum ( for instance , allowing for the possibility of a primordial tilt ) is not necessary .",
    "we quantify the normalization of the power spectrum by specifying @xmath16 , the _ rms _ density fluctuation in spheres of radius @xmath17mpc .",
    "non - gaussianity is specified in terms of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath18 of the primordial fluctuations , where @xmath19 is the probability of the over - density ( linearly extrapolated to a redshift @xmath12 ) in a sphere of radius @xmath20 having a value between @xmath21 and @xmath22 . for most non - gaussian models ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the pdf is scale invariant over the range of scales relevant to cluster formation ( see rb00 for specific examples ) . in this case",
    ", we can make use of a rescaled pdf , which we denote @xmath23 , satisfying @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the _ rms _ fluctuation in spheres of radius @xmath20 .",
    "the rescaled pdf @xmath23 has a mean of zero and an _ rms _ of one . for a wide range of models ( see rb00 for examples ) @xmath23 can be well fit by a log - normal distribution ,",
    "that is @xmath26 where @xmath27 with @xmath28 this distribution has one free parameter @xmath29 , with the limit @xmath30 corresponding to gaussianity . following rgs98 , we characterize each pdf in terms of a single non - gaussianity parameter @xmath31 , where @xmath32 @xmath31 is the probability of obtaining a peak of height @xmath3 or higher for the pdf in question , relative to that for a gaussian model .",
    "a value @xmath33 indicates an excess of large positive fluctuations , @xmath34 indicates a deficit , while @xmath35 indicates gaussian fluctuations .",
    "since rich clusters typically form from @xmath3 or higher peaks in the primordial fluctuations , this parameter is a useful quantifier of non - gaussianity in this context .",
    "the background cosmology is specified by two parameters , the fraction of critical density at @xmath12 contributed by dark matter ( @xmath4 ) and the fraction contributed by a cosmological constant ( @xmath36 .",
    "we restrict our investigation to the flat ( @xmath4+@xmath37=1 ) and open ( @xmath38 ) cases .      the press - schechter ( ps ) formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) allows us to predict the number density of clusters in the universe as a function of cluster mass .",
    "this formalism has been adapted to the non - gaussian case , by colafrancesco , lucchin & matarrese ( 1989 ) , chiu et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and rgs98 and has been shown in rb00 to fit the cluster evolution observed in non - gaussian models of structure formation to better than @xmath39 accuracy .",
    "in particular , the number density of clusters with masses between @xmath40 and @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 \\frac{d[y_c(m)]}{dm}dm.\\ ] ] here @xmath43 is the lagrangian ( pre - collapse ) radius of a sphere giving rise to a cluster of mass @xmath40 , which satisfies @xmath44 with @xmath45 being the comoving background density of the universe .",

    "finally , @xmath51 is a correction factor , given by @xmath52 which is included to ensure that the mass function accounts for the entire mass of the universe . in the gaussian case @xmath51",
    "takes the value two , as originally proposed by press & schechter ( 1974 ) and explained by bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) using the excursion set formalism .",
    "the press - schechter formalism allows us to accurately predict the cluster number density as a function of cluster mass . for most of the clusters considered in this work",
    "we observe not the mass but the temperature of the intra - cluster medium ( via the spectrum of emitted x - rays ) .",
    "we therefore need to make use of a mass - temperature relation in order to compare our models with observations .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; evrard , metzler & navarro 1996 ; eke , navarro & frenk 1998 ) suggest that the relationship between mass and temperature can be well fitted by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the ratio of the mean halo density to the critical density at redshift @xmath48 ( for fitting functions in various cosmologies , see kitayama & suto 1996 ) , @xmath55 is the hydrogen mass fraction ( we take @xmath56 ) , and @xmath57 is the ratio of the specific galaxy kinetic energy to the specific gas thermal energy .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the average value for this quantity is in the range @xmath58 . for the bulk of this work",
    "we take @xmath59 , although we also investigate the effect of varying the value . unfortunately ,",
    "knowledge of the mean value of @xmath57 is not enough to specify our models , as the mass temperature relation is also subject to scatter , with some clusters of a given mass being hotter and other clusters being colder .",
    "simulations suggest that the spread of @xmath57 values can be reasonably fit as a log - normal distribution , that is @xmath60 is gaussianly distributed , with mean @xmath61 and variance @xmath62 . using the distribution of @xmath57 values",
    ", we can infer the probability @xmath63 of a cluster of mass @xmath40 having a temperature between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the expected number density @xmath66 of clusters with temperature between @xmath64 and @xmath65 is then given by @xmath67 due to the fact that @xmath68 for typical models is a sharply falling function of @xmath40 , increasing the scatter @xmath62 systematically boosts @xmath69 .",
    "we adopt @xmath70 as a fiducial choice , though we also investigate the effect of variations about this value .",
    "the additional scatter in the mass - temperature relation caused by temperature measurement errors is typically smaller than the intrinsic scatter discussed above , but we can account for it in the same way by adding temperature measurement errors in quadrature to @xmath62 . obviously , our assumptions about the form of @xmath71 will affect the inferred likelihood of observing a cluster with a given temperature .",
    "we will see later that our results are relatively insensitive to the amplitude of the scatter in temperature values for a given mass , and consequently it is reasonable to assume that the particular choice of a log - normal distribution for this scatter does not bias our results .    to summarize , our models are parameterized by 7 parameters : @xmath10 , @xmath16 , @xmath31 , @xmath4 , @xmath37 , @xmath57 and @xmath72 .",
    "we extract information on the redshift evolution of clusters from three sources :    * henry & arnaud clusters : this is an x - ray selected sample of clusters with galactic latitude @xmath73 and a flux limit @xmath74erg @xmath75 s@xmath15 in the @xmath76 kev band ( henry & arnaud 1991 ) .",

    "in addition , the sample is volume limited by requiring @xmath82 with @xmath83 and @xmath84 . for an explanation of the cooling flow correction procedure , see markevitch ( 1998 ) .",
    "we make use of both cooling flow corrected and uncorrected temperatures in this analysis . * _ emss clusters : _ the emss clusters are selected from an x - ray survey in the 0.3 - 3.5 kev band covering a total area @xmath85 square degrees",
    ". the fraction of survey area @xmath29 sensitive to fluxes larger than @xmath86 can be fit to better than @xmath87 accuracy ( eke et al .",
    "1998 ) for fluxes greater than @xmath88erg @xmath75 s@xmath15 by @xmath89 we consider a volume limited sample of 9 clusters with @xmath90 whose temperatures have been measured by henry using the asca satellite ( henry 97 ) .",
    "we also consider a sample comprising two objects with asca temperatures ( ms0015.9 + 1609 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 kev , mushotzky & scharf 1997 ; ms0451.6 - 0305 , @xmath91 , @xmath93 kev , donahue 1996 ) , for which we take the redshift limits to be @xmath94 .",
    "finally , we consider another sample comprising one object ( ms1054.5 - 0321 , @xmath5 , @xmath95 kev , donahue et al .",
    "1998 ) , with redshift limits taken to be @xmath96 .",
    "we will investigate whether this choice of redshift limits affects our results .",
    "we analyze each sample as follows : first , we model the relationship between luminosity ( @xmath97 ) and temperature for each sample as a gaussian distribution in @xmath98 , with mean given by @xmath99 and a standard deviation @xmath100 the subscript @xmath55 denotes the observing band for the sample in question , and fiducial values for the parameters @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 for each of the cluster samples are ( see eke et al .",
    "1998 ) : markevitch @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 ; henry & arnaud @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 ; emss clusters @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "having assumed a luminosity - temperature ( @xmath117 ) relation , we compute the average volume @xmath118 in which a cluster of temperature @xmath64 could be seen for the sample in question : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the probability distribution of @xmath97 for a given value of @xmath64 ( defined above ) , @xmath121 is the comoving volume element per unit redshift per solid angle , @xmath122 is the solid angle associated with flux limit @xmath97 at redshift @xmath48 , @xmath123 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath124 is the heaviside function @xmath125    the @xmath117 relation for each sample is subject to various uncertainties , and at high redshifts the number of clusters for which luminosity and temperature have been observed is so low that any accurate determination is virtually impossible . for flux limited samples , uncertainties in @xmath120 will lead to uncertainties in @xmath126 , and therefore to uncertainties in the inferred number density of clusters .",
    "however , for surveys which are limited in both flux and volume , sufficiently hot clusters will typically be so bright that for all reasonable luminosities they could be seen throughout the entire survey volume , so the uncertainty in @xmath126 is much smaller .",
    "we investigate this effect by plotting the cumulative temperature function @xmath127 for the markevitch and henry samples discussed above ( @xmath128 is the number density of clusters with temperature greater than @xmath64 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the temperature and maximum volume for the @xmath131 cluster in the sample , and the sum runs over all clusters ) , using four different assumptions about the @xmath117 relationship . for `` fiducial lt '' we use the @xmath117 model and parameters discussed above . for `` high lt ''",
    "we multiply luminosities in the fiducial model by a factor of 10 , and for `` low lt '' we divide by a factor of 2 . for `` actual luminosities '' we revert to the method for calculating @xmath132 for the @xmath133 cluster used by eke et al .",
    "( 1998a ) , that is @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the luminosity of the @xmath133 cluster .",
    "results for these four cases in a critical density universe are shown in figures 1 and 2 . the markevitch sample ( fig .",
    "1 ) , which is volume limited , shows virtually no dependence on the @xmath117 relationship for @xmath136 kev , and the henry sample ( fig .",
    "2 ) is similarly robust for this temperature range . for the remainder of this work",
    ", we will concentrate our analysis on clusters with temperatures @xmath136 kev for the low redshift samples , @xmath137 kev for the @xmath94 sample , and @xmath138 kev for the @xmath96 sample . as discussed , restricting our analysis to the highest temperature clusters reduces the dependence of our results on uncertainties in the @xmath117 relation . as a consequence , we will not worry about the effect of @xmath139-corrections , whose typical effect on the luminosity is less that the uncertainties in the @xmath117 relation .",
    "an additional advantage of restricting our study to the highest temperature clusters is that heating of the intra - cluster medium by supernovae ( which could affect the cluster mass - temperature relation ) is likely to be least important in this regime , as discussed by viana & liddle ( 1999 ) .",
    "we comment briefly on the adopted slope of the @xmath117 relation .",
    "for the markevitch sample , we adopt a slope @xmath105 as measured by markevitch ( 1998 ) for the 0.1 - 2.4 kev observing band .",
    "this corresponds to a slope for the bolometric luminosity vs temperature relation of @xmath140 .",
    "we follow eke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in adopting a slope @xmath109 for the henry and arnaud sample , and @xmath113 for the emss clusters .",
    "self - similar scaling arguments on the other hand would imply a slope @xmath141 ( kaiser 1986 ) , while a different study of the low redshift lt relation ( arnaud & evrard 1999 ) finds a slope of @xmath142 .",
    "as discussed , our analysis is not strongly affected by uncertainties in the @xmath117 relation , and variations of the slope within the range suggested by the observations do not significantly alter our conclusions .    from the above discussion",
    "we anticipate that for some range of temperatures @xmath143 , the maximum volume @xmath126 will be robust , depending only weakly on uncertainties in the @xmath117 relationship . exploiting this fact , we can make use of a simple expression for the likelihood function : assuming that the clusters are poisson distributed , the likelihood @xmath144 of observing a sample of @xmath145 clusters given a temperature function @xmath69 is @xmath146 where the temperature range has been divided into a set of @xmath147 bins , the sum @xmath148 runs over all bins containing a cluster , the sum @xmath149 runs over all bins not containing a cluster , and the bins are sufficiently small that the probability of finding more than one cluster in a bin is negligible . in the limit that the bin size tends to zero ,",
    "@xmath150 satisfies ( up to an additive constant @xmath151 ) @xmath152 where the index @xmath148 runs over all clusters in the sample satisfying @xmath153 .",
    "provided @xmath126 is well determined for the range of temperatures we will consider , this expression gives a robust determination of the likelihood .",
    "eke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have used a very similar expression for the likelihood which also takes account of individual redshifts within a cluster sample . however , since the @xmath69 laws do not change too dramatically within the redshift ranges probed by each of our samples , we choose instead to work just with @xmath69 for the median redshift of each sample .",
    "we now consider in detail the constraints we can place on @xmath4 and non - gaussianity using current observational data . as we will see later , the results do not depend strongly on whether the universe is flat or open , so for the time being we will concentrate on the case of an open universe with zero cosmological constant . to start our discussion , we consider the constraints placed by just two of the datasets : the markevitch data at low redshift , and the @xmath96 data containing ms1054.5 - 0321 at high redshift . figure 3 shows confidence limits derived by combining these two datasets : in the @xmath154 plane assuming an open universe with @xmath35 ( left panel ) , in the @xmath155 plane assuming @xmath1 ( central panel ) and in the @xmath155 plane assuming @xmath156 ( right panel ) .",
    "the solid lines show 90@xmath157 confidence limits for the markevitch data , the dotted lines show 90@xmath157 limits for the @xmath96 data , and the dark and light shaded regions show 68@xmath157 and 90@xmath157 confidence regions for the combined data sets .",
    "confidence limits are computed assuming uniform priors in all variables . under the assumption of gaussianity",
    ", the combined datasets prefer @xmath0 with @xmath1 excluded at more than the @xmath2 level , though we will see in a moment that various systematic uncertainties might affect this conclusion .",
    "a critical universe is consistent with the two datasets if the fluctuations are non - gaussian with @xmath158 .",
    "the discussion above , which uses just two of our datasets , illustrates the basic degeneracy ( in the @xmath154 or @xmath155 plane ) intrinsic to cluster observations at a single redshift , and how this degeneracy is broken using observations of cluster evolution . before embarking on a full likelihood analysis incorporating all of the datasets",
    ", we will check the consistency of the various datasets and investigate various systematic effects which might alter our conclusions .",
    "first , we consider the effect of using different low redshift data .",
    "figure 4 shows the likelihood ( marginalized over @xmath16 assuming a uniform prior ) for four different choices of low redshift data , for the cases @xmath35 , @xmath1 , and @xmath156 .",
    "the low redshift data considered are the markevitch sample , the markevitch sample with temperatures not corrected for cooling flows , the henry and arnaud sample , and the henry and arnaud sample with a redshift limit of @xmath159 imposed .",
    "the likelihood functions are almost identical ( in particular , the temperature corrections in the markevitch sample make very little difference ) , with the exception of the henry and arnaud data without a volume limit .",
    "the difference in this case arises because the hottest clusters in the sample are luminous enough to be visible at redshifts larger than @xmath160 .",
    "for instance , the hottest cluster in the sample ( a2142 ) is sufficiently luminous to be detected out to a redshift of 0.014 , implying @xmath161mpc@xmath162 , while the imposition of the redshift limit reduces @xmath126 to @xmath163mpc@xmath162 .",
    "similar changes in @xmath126 apply to the two next most luminous clusters , implying that the three brightest clusters are all found within the closest @xmath164 of the volume in which they could be detected .",
    "the fact that no clusters are actually observed at @xmath165 in this sample is either a chance occurrence ( the event has moderate statistical significance ) or suggests that either the luminosity - temperature relation or the number abundance of clusters evolves significantly beyond @xmath160 .",
    "the latter two effects would invalidate our analysis , since we do not take into account any evolution within a single redshift bin .",
    "however , this problem can be eliminated by making sure the redshift bin is sufficiently small , for instance by limiting the maximum redshift .",
    "the imposition of a volume limit does indeed yield results which are in extremely close agreement with those from the markevitch sample , and we make use of the markevitch data to normalize the low redshift cluster abundance for most of the remaining discussion . later on we will check whether using the henry & arnaud or the markevitch sample makes a significant difference to our final results .",
    "second , we consider the effect of using different high redshift datasets .",
    "figure 5 shows the likelihood ( marginalized over @xmath16 ) for three different choices of high redshift data , for the cases @xmath35 , @xmath1 , and @xmath156 .",
    "the henry data contains the most clusters and is the best understood systematically , as it is complete to a known flux limit . however , even the most extreme models are not expected to show very much evolution at this moderate redshift , and very little of the available parameter space is ruled out at the @xmath2 level .",
    "the constraints from the two clusters in the interval @xmath94 are somewhat stronger , with @xmath1 with gaussian fluctuations being inconsistent at the @xmath2 level .",
    "however , the greatest statistical weight comes from the highest redshift sample , despite the fact that it contains only one cluster .",
    "( for most of the remaining discussion we consider a model to be inconsistent at the @xmath2 level if @xmath166 , and at the @xmath167 level if @xmath168 , which are the thresholds which would apply if the likelihood function were gaussian ",
    "most of our likelihood functions are close to gaussian at their peak , so this approximation should be reasonable .",
    "these thresholds are shown by horizontal lines in our likelihood plots ) .",
    "next we investigate the effect of uncertainties in the @xmath117 relation on the allowed ranges of @xmath4 and @xmath31 .",
    "figure 6 shows the likelihood for a variety of choices of @xmath117 relationship at low and high redshifts .",
    "as noted , we have attempted to restrict our analysis to temperatures which are sufficiently high that volume limits are more important than flux limits , thus minimizing the importance of the @xmath117 relation .",
    "we see from the figures that changing the @xmath117 relation at high redshift has relatively little effect on the likelihood function . the only change that makes a significant difference is reducing the amplitude of the lt relationship at low redshift .",
    "such a change would imply that the true number density of clusters of a given temperature is in fact higher , increasing the inferred level of cluster evolution and increasing the preferred value of @xmath4 ( or reducing the preferred value of @xmath31 in the non - gaussian case ) .",
    "however , even for the extreme case considered here , where the mean luminosity is reduced by a factor of 2 , the changes to the likelihood function are not large .",
    "now we investigate the effect of uncertainties in the measured temperature of the high redshift cluster ms1054.5 - 0321 . in figure 7",
    "we show the likelihood function marginalized over @xmath16 for the cases @xmath35 , @xmath1 , and @xmath156 under four different assumptions about the true temperature of the cluster ( @xmath169 kev , @xmath170 kev , @xmath171 kev and @xmath172 kev ) . assuming an @xmath173 cluster profile , the corresponding masses within a 1.5mpc comoving radius are @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 respectively if @xmath1 , and @xmath178 , @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 respectively if @xmath156 .",
    "these possibilities span the range allowed by other estimates of the mass of the cluster from weak lensing and velocity dispersion observations ( bahcall & fan 1998a ) . for lower cluster temperatures ,",
    "the preferred value of @xmath4 is higher ( or in the non - gaussian case the preferred value of @xmath31 is higher ) . however , even for the lowest value of @xmath64 considered , an @xmath1 universe with gaussian fluctuations is inconsistent at the @xmath2 level , with the best fit value of @xmath182 ( or @xmath31 in the non - gaussian case ) almost unchanged .",
    "next we consider the effect of varying the range of temperatures @xmath183 over which we perform our likelihood analysis for the high redshift sample .",
    "in figure 8 we show the likelihood function marginalized over @xmath16 for the cases @xmath35 , @xmath1 , and @xmath156 for @xmath184 kev , @xmath185 kev , and @xmath186 kev . for lower values of @xmath187",
    "it becomes increasingly more likely that the @xmath96 sample is incomplete , as there are fainter clusters in this redshift range whose temperatures have not yet been measured .",
    "our analysis assuming @xmath188 kev probably underestimates the true number of clusters in this temperature range ( which it takes to be one ) , and therefore over - estimates the degree of cluster evolution , consequently over - estimating @xmath4 ( or under - estimating @xmath31 in the gaussian case ) .",
    "our analysis assuming @xmath189 kev is less likely to be subject to incompleteness .",
    "however , in the case that the true temperature of ms1054.5 - 0321 turned out to be less than 12 kev , our sample would have over - estimated the number of clusters within the temperature range ( as one instead of zero ) , making the analysis invalid .",
    "the case @xmath190 kev lies in the middle , and the two cases just discussed can be considered to represent a wide range of systematic error from incompleteness of the high redshift sample . in the gaussian case ,",
    "the best fit value of @xmath4 is in the range @xmath191 , but no choice of @xmath187 is able to reconcile a gaussian @xmath1 universe with the data at the @xmath2 level .",
    "next we consider the effect of changes in the mass temperature relationship on our likelihood analysis .",
    "figure 9 shows the likelihood function marginalized over @xmath16 for the cases @xmath35 , @xmath1 , and @xmath156 for different values of the parameters @xmath192 and @xmath62 .",
    "the maximum likelihood values and exclusion limits are not significantly changed by any of these modifications .",
    "also , we consider the effect of varying the power spectrum of the fluctuations .",
    "figure 10 shows the likelihood function marginalized over @xmath16 for the cases @xmath35 , @xmath1 , and @xmath156 and a cdm shape parameter @xmath10 in the range @xmath193 , wide enough to encompass any viable model .",
    "exclusion limits are not significantly altered by variations of @xmath10 in this range .",
    "now we consider the effect of possible systematic errors in the modified press - schechter prediction for non - gaussian models . in rb00",
    "it has been shown that the press - schechter formula can model the number abundance of clusters observed in n - body simulations with non - gaussian initial conditions to better than 25@xmath157 accuracy .",
    "we test the effect of this degree of systematic uncertainty by multiplying the low and high redshift predictions of the cluster number abundance by factors @xmath194 and @xmath195 respectively .",
    "figure 11 shows the likelihood function marginalized over @xmath16 for the standard choice @xmath196 , a model with enhanced evolution for which @xmath197 and @xmath198 , and a model with less evolution , for which @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "increasing the degree of evolution slightly increases the preferred value of @xmath4 , or reduces the preferred value of @xmath31 in the non gaussian case , and decreasing the degree of evolution has a small effect in the opposite direction . even in this extreme case however , where we have changed the relative number densities at low and high redshift by a factor of more than 50@xmath157 , considerably more than the uncertainty suggested by the simulations of rb00 , there is little effect on the results of our likelihood analysis .",
    "one additional source of systematic error is the possibility that the press - schechter formalism could break down in the regime of very rare peaks . in rb00 the non - gaussian press - schechter formalism",
    "has been tested in @xmath201mpc simulations , where limited volume restricts the possibility of testing the density of the rarest clusters .",
    "for the case of gaussian fluctuations , governato et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have carried out very large simulations ( containing @xmath202 particles ) and suggest that the ps formalism may under - predict the density of the rarest peaks by a factor of about 10 .",
    "their observed halo abundance can be well fit by a modified ps formula where the critical overdensity @xmath49 varies with redshift and fluctuation amplitude via @xmath203.\\ ] ] in the central panel of figure 11 we show the result for the likelihood function derived using this modified form for @xmath49 ( long - dashed line ) .",
    "the resulting likelihood function differs little from that obtained using the standard ps formalism , and in particular the case of gaussian fluctuations with @xmath204 is still ruled out at the @xmath2 level . from this discussion",
    "we infer that uncertainties about the validity of the ps formalism in the rare peak limit should not have a large effect on the conclusions of this paper .",
    "finally , we show the effect of assuming a flat universe with a cosmological constant , rather than the open case which we have considered up to now .",
    "figure 12 shows the likelihood function marginalized over @xmath16 for the cases @xmath35 , @xmath156 , and @xmath205 for open and flat universes .",
    "the lambda case typically predicts slightly more evolution than the open case if the other parameters are held fixed .",
    "consequently , the best fit values of @xmath4 are slightly lower , or in the non - gaussian case , the best fit value of @xmath31 is slightly higher .",
    "having considered the importance of various sources of systematic error , we now show the likelihood function derived by combining all of the cluster data at different redshifts . in figure 13",
    "we show the likelihood function ( marginalized over @xmath16 ) for the cases @xmath35 , @xmath206 and @xmath156 , using the combination of the markevitch , henry , @xmath94 and @xmath96 datasets .",
    "we show the results for open and flat universes together with two additional analyses for the open case .",
    "the first , denoted `` low @xmath182 '' , incorporates the major systematic uncertainties favoring a low value of @xmath4 .",
    "the second , denoted `` high @xmath182 '' , incorporates the major systematic uncertainties favoring a high value of @xmath4 .",
    "for the `` low @xmath182 '' model , we replace the markevitch data at low redshift with the henry and arnaud sample , without a volume limit , and we adopt a lower temperature bound of @xmath186 kev for our analysis of the @xmath96 sample .",
    "for the `` high @xmath182 '' model , we multiply the press - schechter prediction for the low redshift sample by a factor @xmath199 , and the predictions for the @xmath94 and @xmath96 samples by a factor @xmath200 .",
    "we also adopt a normalization for the mass - temperature relationship of @xmath207 , use a temperature for ms1054.5 - 0321 of @xmath208kev , and adopt a lower temperature bound of @xmath188 for the analysis of the @xmath96 sample .",
    "the results from the `` high @xmath182 '' and `` low @xmath182 '' analyses span a reasonable range of systematic uncertainty in the true likelihood function .    for interpreting most of the results in this paper ,",
    "we have made the simplifying assumption that the likelihood levels corresponding to a given confidence limit are just the levels that would be appropriate for a gaussian distribution . in the gaussian case",
    "the @xmath167 limit is @xmath209 and the @xmath2 limit is @xmath210 . clearly some of our likelihood functions are not well approximated as a gaussian distribution , and for this final analysis we quote precise limits for each likelihood curve , assuming uniform priors in @xmath211 and @xmath212 , with the parameters restricted to lie in the range plotted .",
    "we find that @xmath167 thresholds are within the range @xmath213 and the @xmath2 thresholds are within the range @xmath214 ( that is , very close to the gaussian levels ) for almost all the curves in figure 13 .",
    "the only exceptions are the open and `` low omega '' models in the @xmath215 case , for which the @xmath167 limit is @xmath216 and the @xmath2 limit is @xmath217 , and the `` high omega '' model in the @xmath215 case , for which the @xmath167 limit is @xmath218 , and the @xmath2 limit is @xmath219 .    to summarize the results of the full likelihood analysis",
    ", we find that for a gaussian universe , the best fit value of @xmath4 is in the range @xmath220 , with @xmath1 inconsistent at the @xmath2 level independent of almost all sources of systematic error .",
    "the gaussian , @xmath1 case can only be reconciled at the @xmath2 level by a conspiracy of several systematic effects working in the right direction . if we assume that @xmath1 , then the predicted degree of cluster evolution can be reconciled with the observations if @xmath221 , with the best fit value being @xmath222 . under the assumption that @xmath156 , gaussianity is always consistent with the data , but a wide range of non - gaussian models also fit , with all values @xmath223 ( or @xmath224 in the lambda case ) acceptable at the @xmath2 level .",
    "these conclusions are robust to a wide range of systematic uncertainties , and independent of whether the universe is open or flat .",
    "we discuss briefly the degree of non - gaussianity which these @xmath31 values represent . figure 14 shows probability distribution functions with @xmath35 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "we see that the gaussian and the @xmath225 cases are barely distinguishable , with the differences only becoming apparent for the rare tail of fluctuations .",
    "we reiterate that the level of non - gaussianity represented by the @xmath225 pdf is sufficient to reconcile an @xmath1 universe with the observed degree of cluster evolution .",
    "the @xmath226 pdf differs from the gaussian case more obviously over its entire range , not just for the rare tail of perturbations .",
    "we can also relate the parameter @xmath31 to some more familiar characterizations of non - gaussianity . in figure 15",
    ", we show the relationship between skewness @xmath227 , kurtosis @xmath139 , and non - gaussianity parameter @xmath31 for the log normal family of pdfs we are considering . since the pdf is normalized to have mean zero and standard deviation one , the skewness is just @xmath228 while the kurtosis is @xmath229 the @xmath225 case has a skewness of @xmath230 , and a kurtosis of @xmath231 , while the @xmath232 case has a skewness of @xmath233 and a kurtosis of @xmath234 . some typical @xmath31 values for physical models",
    "are : cosmic strings ",
    "@xmath235 ( rb00 ) , cosmic textures",
    " @xmath236 ( park , spergel & turok 1991 ) , peebles icdm @xmath237 ( rb00 ) .",
    "the latter two models would therefore appear to be ruled out if the matter density of the universe is of order @xmath230 .    from this discussion",
    ", we see that the level of non - gaussianity required to reconcile an @xmath1 universe with existing cluster evolution data is relatively small , and less than the amount predicted by many well motivated non - gaussian models .",
    "one promising scenario which could ` save ' @xmath1 is a special form of `` hybrid inflation '' , where an initial spectrum of adiabatic gaussian fluctuations is further perturbed by the evolution of a network of cosmic defects ( contaldi , hindmarsh & magueijo 1999 ; battye & weller 1998 ) .",
    "the level of non - gaussianity in such a model would be lower than that resulting from the action of the defect network alone .",
    "of course , for this model to work it would also have to overcome a number of independent arguments against a critical density universe ( see e.g. bahcall & fan 1998b ) .",
    "as one last point , we comment on our particular choice of the parameter @xmath31 as a quantifier of non - gaussianity .",
    "let us consider a more general non - gaussianity statistic , @xmath238 , defined as @xmath239 @xmath238 is the probability of obtaining a peak of height @xmath240 or higher , relative to that for a gaussian distribution .",
    "for the bulk of the discussion in this paper we make use of the parameter @xmath241 .",
    "figure 16 shows the parameters @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 as a function of @xmath31 , for the case of a log - normal pdf .",
    "although the plot has been produced using a log - normal distribution , an almost identical plot would result for a @xmath247 pdf .",
    "we have found that log - normal and @xmath247 distributions with the same value of @xmath244 give very similar predictions for the cluster abundance , at least over the range of masses and redshifts discussed here . since log - normal and @xmath247 pdfs with the same value of @xmath31 have very similar values of @xmath243 , @xmath245 and @xmath246 , any of these parameters would also be an acceptable choice for parameterizing non - gaussianity .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath244 since the collapse threshold of a typical cluster in the local universe is about @xmath3 , so that the value of @xmath244 has a simple physical interpretation .",
    "by contrast , the parameter @xmath242 would not be a useful quantifier of non - gaussianity , since its value is almost independent of @xmath31 .",
    "in extreme cases where the pdf is not accurately fit by a log - normal or @xmath247 distribution , the use of the single parameter @xmath31 may be inadequate , and it may be necessary to consider the full form of the distribution .",
    "we have seen that existing cluster evolution data strongly disfavors an @xmath1 universe with gaussian fluctuations , preferring either a low value of @xmath4 , or a high value of @xmath31 .",
    "an independent measure of @xmath4 ( from cmb data and supernovae observations for example ) would therefore allow us to draw conclusions about the degree of non - gaussianity in the universe .",
    "let us consider three different models which are roughly degenerate with respect to current cluster data : a model with @xmath206 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , a model with @xmath205 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and a model with @xmath156 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 .",
    "the likelihood function of these models relative to the observational data considered above is shown in figure 17 . to evaluate these likelihood functions ,",
    "we have assumed that @xmath4 is measured to within @xmath254 for the @xmath255 cases , and then marginalized over this uncertainty . for the @xmath206 model , assuming that we have an unambiguous determination of the true value of @xmath4 , the current cluster data gives a clear detection of the non - gaussianity of the fluctuations , as discussed above",
    ". for the @xmath205 model , the current observational data is unable to detect the non - gaussianity , with gaussian fluctuations allowed at the @xmath2 level . for the @xmath156 case ,",
    "gaussian fluctuations are consistent with the data , with the non - gaussianity parameter constrained to be @xmath256 at the @xmath2 level .",
    "for each of the models just mentioned , we have also computed likely confidence limits which could be achieved by a considerable but realistic increase in the volume of cluster evolution data . for each model ,",
    "we have generated mock realizations of the markevitch catalogue , and of a complete emss catalogue , assuming that temperatures are measured for all clusters within the emss survey for which @xmath136kev and @xmath257 . to generate these catalogues",
    ", we split the surveys into a number of redshift slices ( one slice for the markevitch data , with the same redshift and flux limits and the same sky coverage , and four slices for the emss data with @xmath90 , @xmath258 , @xmath94 , and @xmath96 , assuming the sky coverage and flux limits of the emss survey ) . for each slice , we compute the mean volume surveyed for each cluster temperature , assuming the fiducial lt relationships given above .",
    "we then generate a poisson sample of clusters satisfying the @xmath69 law for the model in question , computed at the median redshift of the sample .",
    "we now assume that the true value of @xmath4 has been measured by some independent method ( to plus or minus 0.05 , except for the @xmath1 case , where we assume an exact determination ) and ask how well the mock catalogues are able to constrain the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath31 .",
    "results for the likelihood function ( marginalized over @xmath16 , which is unknown , and the uncertainty in @xmath4 ) are shown in figure 18 . in the @xmath1 case the improved data",
    "considerably reduces the errors on the determination of @xmath31 , and in the @xmath205 case an unambiguous detection of non - gaussianity would be possible at the @xmath2 level . in the @xmath156 case , the allowed range of @xmath31 is not significantly reduced , with the limit still being @xmath223 at the @xmath2 level .    from the above discussion",
    ", we see that even the considerable improvement in the quantity of cluster data discussed above would not significantly improve constraints on non - gaussianity if @xmath4 is really of order 0.3 .",
    "the reason cluster evolution does not give us such strong constraints in this case is that in a low density universe , clusters are not such rare events .",
    "for this reason , they do not probe the high-@xmath259 tail of the pdf , which is where gaussian and non - gaussian pdfs tend to differ most significantly .",
    "this fact is illustrated in figure 19 , where we show the cumulative number density of clusters expected at redshifts @xmath77 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 for two models of structure formation ( gaussian  @xmath252 , @xmath253 , and non - gaussian ",
    "@xmath263 , @xmath264 ) , both with @xmath156 , which are nearly degenerate with respect to the real and mock data discussed above .",
    "we see that the degree of evolution between @xmath77 and @xmath260 begins to differ considerably between the two models only for cluster temperatures larger than about 20 kev .",
    "however , clusters this hot are so rare ( @xmath265mpc@xmath266 ) that the surveys considered above do not probe enough volume to place any constraints on the number density .",
    "as we move to higher redshifts , lower temperature clusters become rarer , many-@xmath259 events , and the degree of evolution to @xmath261 differs considerably between the two models for cluster temperatures of order 15 kev . for the non - gaussian model discussed above , the number density of such clusters at redshift @xmath261 is @xmath267mpc@xmath266 , meaning that a survey sensitive to clusters in the range @xmath268 would have to cover approximately 1000 square degrees to find an average of one @xmath269 kev cluster .",
    "the existence of such a cluster would however be ten times less likely in a gaussian universe , where @xmath270mpc@xmath266 .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that if the matter density of the universe does indeed turn out to be of order @xmath271 , much deeper cluster data will be required to improve constraints on non - gaussianity , with surveys covering 1000 or more square degrees capable of detecting hot clusters ( @xmath272 kev ) at redshifts @xmath273 .",
    "a catalogue based on serendipitous cluster detections from the forthcoming xmm satellite could hope to cover such an area to sufficient depth ( romer 1998 ) .",
    "we make one final point on the degree to which future data will be able to constrain non - gaussianity . from the above discussion",
    ", it is clear that the ability to detect non - gaussianity depends on the detection of clusters arising from rare peaks in the primordial distribution .",
    "in addition to carrying out deeper observations , it will obviously be important to extend theoretical tests of the non - gaussian press - schechter formalism to larger volumes , and to investigate in detail any deviations from the ps formulae which exist in the rare peak limit .",
    "we have made use of a modified version of the press - schechter formalism to examine the constraints on non - gaussianity which can be derived from observations of evolution of the galaxy cluster number abundance .",
    "our results are summarized in figure 13 , which shows likelihood functions for the combined cluster datasets for the cases @xmath35 ( gaussian fluctuations ) , @xmath1 , and @xmath156 . for an open universe with gaussian fluctuations ,",
    "the maximum likelihood value of the matter density on the basis of current observations is @xmath274 , with the case @xmath1 inconsistent with the data at the @xmath2 level . if we assume an @xmath1 universe with non - gaussian fluctuations , the best fit value of the non - gaussianity parameter is in the range @xmath275 , with @xmath221 required for consistency with the data at the @xmath2 level .",
    "the degree of non - gaussianity required to ` save ' the critical density universe is therefore relatively small , and could easily be realized by physically motivated models such as the combination adiabatic and defect seeded perturbations predicted by some hybrid inflation models .",
    "if we assume an @xmath156 universe , the non - gaussianity parameter is constrained to be @xmath223 ( @xmath224 in the lambda case ) at the @xmath2 level , implying that some well motivated non - gaussian models , such as textures ( @xmath236 ) and peebles icdm ( @xmath237 ) would be inconsistent with the data .",
    "these conclusions are robust to a wide range of sources of systematic uncertainty .",
    "an @xmath1 universe with gaussian fluctuations could only be reconciled with the data if a conspiracy of several systematic errors were all to modify our conclusions in the right direction . in particular , our results",
    "are unaffected by possible systematic errors in the press - schechter prediction for the cluster abundance in non - gaussian models , which rb00 has shown to be less than 25@xmath157 .",
    "our conclusions are also largely independent of whether the universe is open or flat ( slightly lower values of @xmath4 or higher values of @xmath31 are preferred in the cosmological constant case ) .",
    "since the non - gaussian press - schechter formalism requires only the probability distribution function of primordial fluctuations as input , our analysis is independent of any uncertain features of the non - gaussian physics in specific models .",
    "one source of uncertainty which does deserve further attention is the possibility that the ps formalism could break down in the very rare halo limit , as suggested by recent very large simulations ( for example governato et al .",
    "our preliminary analysis in section  [ sec - results ] suggests that this effect should not be too important for the range of cluster masses and redshifts discussed here , but this conclusion should be tested using larger simulations in the non - gaussian case .",
    "the techniques discussed here allow us to constrain primordial non - gaussianity in the universe , provided we have an independent measurement of the matter density @xmath4 .",
    "we can realistically expect to gain such a measurement with high precision from the combination of upcoming cmb and supernovae data .",
    "if the matter density is measured to be @xmath1 then the current cluster evolution data represents a detection of non - gaussianity .",
    "if the matter density is measured to be @xmath205 or lower then both gaussian and non - gaussian fluctuations are consistent with current cluster evolution data .",
    "our results for the gaussian case agree well with those of bahcall & fan ( 1998a ) who find @xmath276 and eke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who find @xmath277 , each using similar data to that considered here .",
    "our results disagree however with those of blanchard & bartlett ( 1998 ) , who find evidence in favor of an @xmath1 universe by combining the emss and rosat samples . as for non - gaussian models ,",
    "our results are consistent with those of willick ( 1998 ) in that both studies allow for a significant degree of non - gaussianity if @xmath278 .",
    "our analysis however does not significantly disfavor gaussianity in this case .",
    "this difference is probably due to the fact that we include more clusters and allow for more sources of systematic error , particularly in the low - redshift normalization .",
    "our results are consistent with those of rgs98 and koyama et al .",
    "( 1999 ) provided that the matter density of the universe is low .",
    "in particular , rgs98 found that a significant amount of non - gaussianity ( @xmath279 ) was required to reconcile cluster abundance and cluster correlation data in the @xmath156 case .",
    "we caution the reader however that the arguments used in these last two papers depend on a model for halo correlations in non - gaussian models whose agreement with n - body simulations is currently uncertain . on the other hand , the arguments used in the current work , and that of willick ( 1998 )",
    ", are based on a model for halo abundance in non - gaussian models which has been shown to agree well with that observed in simulations .",
    "we have also investigated the improvement to constraints on non - gaussianity which we could expect from a realistic increase in the quantity of data .",
    "if the matter density of the universe is measured to be high ( @xmath4 greater than of order 0.6 ) , then a moderate increase in the amount of cluster evolution data will allow a definite detection of non - gaussianity .",
    "however , if the matter density is measured to be low , then a substantial increase in the quantity of cluster evolution will be required in order to significantly improve upon the limits derived here .",
    "the reason that constraints are weaker in the @xmath156 case is that clusters at moderate redshifts ( @xmath280 ) are no longer particularly rare events , while the strongest constraints on gaussianity come from probing the rarest tail of fluctuations .",
    "the best prospect for constraining non - gaussianity in this case is to carry out deep surveys capable of detecting hot clusters ( @xmath269 kev ) at high redshift ( @xmath273 ) .",
    "such surveys would be able to distinguish a non - gaussian universe with @xmath281 from a universe with gaussian fluctuations if the area covered was of order 1000 square degrees .",
    "conducting such surveys is a challenge which will deserve considerable attention if the matter density is indeed confirmed to be low .",
