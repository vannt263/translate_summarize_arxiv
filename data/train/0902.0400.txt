    "a variety of transport mechanisms may arise from the physical properties of the diverse cargoes being transported .",
    "for example , in the case of large cargoes , such as organelles , mrna or virus particles , diffusion may not be sufficiently fast nor be spatially controlled .",
    "these cargoes are often transported by motor proteins that processively move to and from the nucleus along specific cytoskeletal filaments @xcite .    the cytoskeleton is typically composed of three types of filaments : microfilaments ( _ e.g. _ actin ) , microtubules ( _ e.g. _ tubulin @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , and intermediate filaments ( _ e.g. _ lamins ) @xcite .",
    "molecular motors most often associate with and process cargo along actin and microtubules @xcite .",
    "these two filament types are structurally very different from each other .",
    "microtubules ( mt ) are thicker ( 25 nm diameter ) and have a specific radial orientation with respect to the cell nucleus .",
    "actin filaments are more randomly distributed near the periphery of the cell , and are less thick ( 8 nm diameter ) than mts @xcite .",
    "moreover , filaments are directional .",
    "the ends of a microtubule are structurally different and labelled `` positive '' or `` negative , '' while the ends of actin filaments are `` pointed '' or `` barbed . ''",
    "accordingly , there are different types of motor proteins associated with not only different filament types , but with the direction of transport along these filaments",
    ". the mt - specific motor proteins are kinesins ( _ e.g. _ , kinesin i , ii ) that can move along mts away from the nucleus on the positive direction , and dyneins that move in the opposite direction towards the negative end of a microtubule @xcite .",
    "various forms of the actin - specific motor myosin transport cargo toward the barbed ( _ e.g. _ myov ) or pointed ( _ e.g. _ myovi ) ends @xcite .",
    "since each motor is highly selective , and cargoes need to be moved on both directions of each filament , there are other proteins / cofactors that facilitate molecular transport by associating with specific motors and filaments . for example , dynactin is a cofactor of dynein that enhances both the processivity of dynein and its affinity to certain cargoes @xcite .",

    "the identification of motor proteins , their structure and properties have also led to several theoretical studies @xcite that have further improved our understanding of how a single motor protein is able to move a cargo along a cytoskeletal filament .",
    "since many associated proteins / cofactors affect transport dynamics @xcite , experimental and theoretical investigations of model systems that include only one motor and the tracks on which they bind do not yield a complete description of molecular motor based transport _ in vivo_. therefore , other recent studies have focused on how cooperativity among different molecular motors can facilitate cargo transport along straight , branched , and intersecting cytoskeletal filaments @xcite . in the experiments of ali _ et al .",
