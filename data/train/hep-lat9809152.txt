    "a recent development in the nrqcd study of heavy quarks on the lattice is the realization that the mixing of a dimension-4 operator with the axial - vector current , while nominally @xmath12 , has a significant effect in the value of the heavy - light decay constant@xcite .",
    "an investigation of how this mixing effect affects the scaling behavior of the decay constant is an important issue .    in this work",
    "we study this problem , through simulations , with and without the operator mixing taken into account , at three values of @xmath3 .",
    "a comparison is also made of the present nrqcd results with our previous calculation with the relativistic heavy quark action@xcite .",
    "we describe the light quark by the @xmath13-improved sw clover action with one - loop corrected @xmath14 as in ref .",

    "@xmath46@xcite is that the coefficient @xmath47 is not suppressed by @xmath48 and remains as @xmath49 for heavy quark , so that the mixing with the @xmath41 operator yields a large @xmath50 contribution .",

    "we carry out simulation at three values of @xmath3 employing lattices and statistics as listed in table [ tab : para ] .",

    "figure [ fig : phifulvsmul ] shows our results for the quantity @xmath53 @xmath4@xmath54@xmath21@xmath55@xmath56 at @xmath3=5.9 .",
    "we observe that the contribution of the mixing operators ( @xmath57 ) , which is the difference between ( -0.4ex s ) and ( -0.4ex s ) in the figure , is as large as that of the multiplicative renormalization of the leading operator ( @xmath58 ) , which is the difference between ( -0.4ex s ) and ( -0.4ex s ) .",
    "this effect becomes more significant towards heavier quark mass due to a large value of @xmath59 and that of the matrix element of @xmath41 , so that the slope of @xmath60 becomes reduced with the inclusion of the mixing , as observed in ref .",
    "we find this behavior to be more pronounced at @xmath61 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phinrvscl ] we compare results for @xmath15 nrqcd action with previous jlqcd results@xcite obtained with the sw clover action for heavy quark , interpreted as a non - relativistic action within the fermilab formalism@xcite , at @xmath3@xmath4@xmath62 . since the latter calculation does not include the effect of @xmath12 mixing , we plot nrqcd results for the one - loop corrected leading operator . a good agreement of results for the two actions provides a check of viability of both the @xmath28 expansion approach of nrqcd and the fermilab interpretation of the clover action for heavy quark .",
    "figure [ fig : avsfb ] presents the scaling behavior of @xmath1 without ( open symbols ) and with ( filled symboles ) operator mixing , and for two choices of the momentum scale @xmath63@xmath4@xmath64 and @xmath65 for the coupling constant .",
    "a large scatter of the values at @xmath66@xmath67@xmath68 gev@xmath69 ( @xmath3@xmath4@xmath70 ) shows that one - loop estimates of renormalization factors are not reliable at such a large lattice spacing .",
    "this problem is substantially alleviated at @xmath3@xmath4@xmath71 and 6.1 ( @xmath72 gev@xmath69 ) . in this region ,",
    "the nrqcd result without including the operator mixing contribution has a large @xmath6 dependence , which is sizably reduced with full inclusion of the mixing .",
    "it is gratifying that the value of @xmath1 in this range of @xmath6 are reasonably consistent with the results from the clover quark action ( -0.1exs)@xcite over the same range .",
    "strictly speaking , such a comparison is to be made with the continuum extrapolated value of the latter .",
    "a mild scaling violation exhibited by the clover result suggests that the agreement would not be severely violated in such an extrapolation .",
    "two points , however , have to be checked to consolidate the agreement : ( i ) the nrqcd values suffer from @xmath73 errors toward smaller lattice spacing , whose magnitude in our range of @xmath6 needs to be examined .",
    "( ii ) the clover result does not incorporate effects of the @xmath12 mixing , whose magnitude is yet unknown .",
    "we estimate the physical value of the heavy - light decay constants from results at @xmath3@xmath4@xmath62 obtained with the @xmath15 nrqcd action . since the value of @xmath63 is not known , we take the static result @xmath63@xmath4@xmath74  @xcite as a guide , and calculate the central value from an average of results for @xmath63@xmath4@xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we then find that @xmath75 the first error is statistical including that from chiral extrapolation .",
    "remaining are systematic errors arising from ( i ) the uncertainty of @xmath76 estimated by dispersion of results for @xmath63@xmath4@xmath64 and @xmath65 , ( ii ) @xmath77 corrections estimated from comparison of results with the @xmath15 and the @xmath78@xmath68@xmath21@xmath79@xmath80 calculations , ( iii ) @xmath81@xmath21@xmath82@xmath83 errors estimated by dividing @xmath84 contribution , which is derived from the result with static perturbative correction , by @xmath6@xmath85 , ( iv ) scaling violation from comparison of the values at @xmath3@xmath4@xmath62 with those at @xmath3@xmath4@xmath71 and @xmath70 , and ( v ) uncertainty in @xmath66 , where the upper and lower errors correspond to the choice @xmath66@xmath42.62 gev from charmonium 1s-1p splitting and 2.21 gev from @xmath86 as quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively . for @xmath2 the central value",
