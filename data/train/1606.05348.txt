    "in contrast , other studies reported no correlation between the opening angle and the intrinsic velocity of the outflows in the nlr @xcite , or an anti - correlation between opening angel and intrinsic velocity of outflows in the coronal - line region @xcite . since our finding is based on the comparison of the spatially integrated kinematics with monte carlo simulations , it is difficult to directly compare our results with the previous studies , which were mainly based on the spatially resolved measurements of gas kinematics .",

    "then , @xmath117 is used to calculate the physical properties of outflows , e.g. , energy injection rate as @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the mass of gas , and @xmath120 is the mass outflow rate , which is proportional to bulk velocity , i.e. , @xmath121 .",
    "thus , measuring the bulk velocity is important ; however , since the measured [ ] line width , i.e. , @xmath9}}$ ] , is used as a proxy for the bulk velocity , it is likely that the bulk velocity is significantly underestimated since the line width is affected by the bicone inclination and the dust extinction ( see section [ sec : bincl ] and [ sec : grid ] ) .",
    "for example , if the amount of dust extinction is as large as @xmath090% , @xmath75 decreases by @xmath030% for type 2 agns if the inclination changes from 0@xmath27  to 40@xmath27  ( see section [ sec : simvvd ] ) .",
    "hence , the estimated @xmath121 can be underestimated by @xmath030% , while the energy injection rate @xmath122 can be underestimated by @xmath070% .",
    "since dust extinction decreases @xmath75 , but increases @xmath74 , we find a remedy for the dust extinction effect by combining @xmath75 and @xmath74 .",
    "the quadrature sum of @xmath75 and @xmath74 is a good approximation of the dust - corrected velocity dispersion ( @xmath123 ) , which we calculate from our model by excluding the dust extinction effect ( see figure [ fig : sigma_0 ] ) . in practice",
    ", @xmath74 itself is difficult to measure in many cases due to the lack of systemic velocity measurements .    a more severe limitation of estimating the bulk velocity of gas outflows is due to the unknown bicone inclination .",
    "since the bicone inclination ranges from 0@xmath27  to 40@xmath27  for type 2 agns , @xmath75 can significantly increase with the inclination angle .",
    "for example , if we use @xmath14=40@xmath27  for the model , @xmath75 increases by @xmath050% from the case of @xmath1240@xmath27 .",
    "if we use a smaller opening angle , i.e. , @xmath14=20@xmath27 , @xmath75 increases by a factor of @xmath03 . since the estimated bulk velocity and @xmath120 strongly depend on the inclination of the bicone , the inclination effect should be carefully considered in estimating feedback energy . note that the effect of bicone inclination is much more significant in type 1 agns than in type 2 agns , since type 1 agns are expected to have more inclined bicone compared to type 2 agns . in figure 14",
    "we present the quadrature sum of @xmath75 and @xmath74 ( i.e. , @xmath125 ) as a function of the bicone inclination angle . based on a monte carlo simulation with a uniform distribution of bicone orientation angles and @xmath14=40@xmath27 , we find that @xmath125 of type 1 agns is larger by an average factor of @xmath01.6 than that of type 2 agns . this systemic difference of [ ] line width between type 1 and type 2 agns can be directly tested using a combined sample of type 1 and type 2 agns .",
    "= @xmath126^{0.5}$ ] ) as a function of bicone inclination .",
    "different colored lines represent various amounts of dust extinction , which are negligible .",
    "the shaded and unshaded regions represent the range of the bicone inclinations for type 1 and 2 agns , respectively .",
    "the dotted and dashed line represents the mean @xmath125 for type 1 and 2 agns , respectively , after considering the probability of @xmath22 for each type of agn . for these simulations , we assume the constant velocity as @xmath55=1000 km s@xmath1 , the constant radial flux , @xmath14=40@xmath27 , @xmath15=20@xmath27 , and @xmath36=60@xmath27.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]      while our 3d outflow models well reproduce the observed characteristics of the [ ] vvd distribution , it has limitations .",
    "for example , in the models , we do not include the effect of the host galaxy s gravitational potential ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "such a gravitational effect additionally increases @xmath75 of ionized gas , and also affects @xmath74 .",
    "nevertheless , the stellar velocity dispersion , which represents the gravitational potential , is relatively small ( 100@xmath26200 km s@xmath1 ) for typical galaxies in the sample of type 2 agns ( see paper i ) .",
    "thus , the additional kinematic component does not significantly change the observed kinematics for agns with powerful outflows ( e.g. , @xmath9}}$]>200 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "another potential contamination of the gas kinematics is due to gas inflows as observed in the local seyfert galaxies .",
    "if the inflow is present , the observed features will be similar to those of outflow , but with an opposite sign of @xmath74 .",
    "the approaching , infalling gas has a larger chance of being obscured than the receding , infalling gas , due to the dust in the stellar disk .",
    "thus , agns with positive velocity are more likely to be detected than agns with negative velocity . however , this expectation is not consistent with the observed vvd distribution of type 2 agns , suggesting that inflow does not seem strong among local type 2 agns .",
    "we note that we use a simple dust model with wavelength - independent opacity .",
    "thus , these models are expected to be applied to a single emission line for simulating gas kinematics . for comparison with more detailed kinematic studies based on multiple emission - lines ,",
    "it is necessary to use our models with different extinction values for each emission line since the dust extinction is higher at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we constructed 3d models of biconical outflows combined with a thin dust plane in order to investigate the physical properties of gas outflows . after examining the effect of each model parameter on the simulated velocity and velocity dispersion of gas outflow",
    ", we presented the simulated emission - line profiles , and compared model grids and monte carlo simulations with the observed [ ] vvd diagram of local type 2 agns taken from paper i. we summarize our findings as follows .",
    "the primary drivers of the spatially - integrated [ ] velocity and velocity dispersion are the intrinsic velocity , the bicone inclination , and the amount of dust extinction .",
    "velocity dispersion @xmath75 increases as the intrinsic velocity or the bicone inclination increases , while velocity @xmath74 ( velocity shift with respect to systemic velocity ) increases as the amount of dust extinction increases .      \\3 . by comparing the model grids with the observed vvd diagram of 39,000 type 2 agns , we constrain the intrinsic velocity of gas outflows , ranging from @xmath0500 km s@xmath1  to 1000 km s@xmath1  for the majority of agns , and up to @xmath015002000 km s@xmath1  for extreme cases .    \\4 . the observed increase of the number ratio of agns with negative [ ] velocity to agns with positive [ ] velocity is well reproduced by monte carlo simulations , suggesting that agns with higher intrinsic velocities tend to have wider opening angles .",
    "monte carlo simulations based on our 3d outflow models well reproduce the observed [ ] vvd distribution of local type 2 agns , demonstrating the potential of the model for studying the physical properties of gas outflows .",
    "although various physical parameters of outflows , i.e. , intrinsic velocity and inclination of the bicone , can not be directly measured , our models can provide valuable constraints on these parameters .",
    "our 3d models are applicable to spatially resolved kinematics , for investigating the spatial distribution of gas kinematics . in the future",
