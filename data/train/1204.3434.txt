    "this is a consequence of the general robin boundary conditions .",
    "while they are perfectly reflecting for positive energy states , they may still bind negative energy states to the wall .",

    "the accidental degeneracy between states of different angular momenta , which is generated by the runge - lenz vector , is lifted .",

    "cavity resonances emerge naturally from the robin boundary condition .",
    "the fact that resonances in a finite volume manifest themselves as avoided level crossings is familiar from quantum field theory , in particular , lattice field theory @xcite .",
    "figure [ resonance ] ( top ) zooms in on an avoided level crossing between a 1s and a 2s state in a spherical cavity of radius @xmath82 .",
    "the corresponding wave functions are illustrated at the bottom of figure [ resonance ] .",
    "1.5 cm      it is well known that the hydrogen atom in infinite space enjoys an accidental @xmath83 symmetry generated by the angular momentum @xmath25 together with the runge - lenz vector @xmath84 due to this dynamically enhanced symmetry , the states with quantum number @xmath85 are @xmath86-fold degenerate . for example , the 2s state is degenerate with the three 2p states , and the 3s state is degenerate with the three 3p and the five 3d states .",
    "as we have seen , the spectrum of hydrogen confined to a spherical cavity no longer has these accidental degeneracies . since the hard wall boundary condition of the spherical cavity does not violate rotation invariance ,",
    "the angular momentum @xmath25 is obviously still conserved .",
    "the runge - lenz vector , on the other hand , is no longer a conserved quantity .    as differential operators , both the hamiltonian and the runge - lenz vector",
    "still have the same form as in the infinite volume .",

    "if @xmath93 is self - adjoint , we must decide whether the new wave function @xmath94 obeys the boundary condition @xmath95 by inserting the expression of eq.([runge ] ) into this relation and by using the radial schrdinger equation for @xmath96 , one obtains @xmath97 \\psi_{\\nu , l}(r).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have used the boundary condition @xmath98 for the original wave function . since @xmath99 , the right - hand side of eq.([rungeselfad ] ) can not vanish for all values of the energy @xmath100 .",
    "hence , the wave function @xmath94 that results from the application of @xmath91 on @xmath101 does not obey the boundary condition eq.([bcchi ] ) , and thus does not lie in the domain of the hamiltonian .",
    "this implies that the runge - lenz vector @xmath93 is not self - adjoint in this domain .",
    "consequently , the fact that the differential operators @xmath15 and @xmath93 commute in the naive sense is irrelevant , because @xmath15 can not even act on the wave function @xmath94 generated by @xmath91 , since it is outside the domain of @xmath15 .",
    "this explains why the accidental degeneracy associated with the runge - lenz vector is lifted in the spherical cavity .",
    "1.5 cm    remarkably , as was pointed out in @xcite , at @xmath80 a remnant of the accidental symmetry persists for a cavity of radius @xmath102 . in that case , a state of angular momentum @xmath44 is degenerate with a state of angular momentum @xmath103 .",
    "for example , in a cavity of radius @xmath104 , the states 2s and 3d , 3s and 4d , 4s and 5d , etc .  are degenerate and thus form multiplets of @xmath105 degenerate states .",

    "are degenerate , forming multiplets of @xmath107 degenerate states .",
    "these degeneracies arise because , for @xmath102 , the operator @xmath108 maps a wave function @xmath101 back into the domain of the hamiltonian . again using the radial schrdinger equation , it is straightforward to show that @xmath109 with @xmath110 \\psi_{\\nu , l}(r ) .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ \\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath80 , the wave function obeys the boundary condition @xmath111 .",
    "hence , for @xmath112 the wave function @xmath113 obeys the same boundary condition , @xmath114 , and thus indeed lies in the domain of the hamiltonian .",
    "taking a derivative with respect to @xmath115 of eq.([chieq ] ) , and once again using the radial schrdinger equation , one obtains an expression for @xmath116 . combining this expression with eq.([chieq ] ) and using the general boundary condition @xmath98 , one finally obtains an expression for @xmath117 , which is too complicated to be displayed here .",
    "remarkably , as was already pointed out in @xcite , for @xmath102 and @xmath118 this expression again vanishes independent of the energy @xmath100 , and thus @xmath113 again belongs to the domain of the hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , an additional accidental degeneracy also arises in this case . for @xmath104 and @xmath118 one",
    "finds that the states 2s and 3d , 3s and 4d , 4s and 5d , etc .",
    "are degenerate .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ accidental ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in this case , the energy of the 1s state is @xmath26-independent .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that the ground state wave function is a simple decaying exponential proportional to @xmath119 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath106 and @xmath118 , the states 3p and 4f , 4p and 5f , 5s and 6f , etc .",
    "are degenerate .    following the same steps as before",
    ", one can check whether the radial wave function that results from @xmath120 obeys the self - adjoint extension condition @xmath121 independent of the energy @xmath100 . in a rather lengthy calculation",
    "we have convinced ourselves that this is not the case for @xmath122 and 4 , and we suspect that the same is true for larger values of @xmath49 .",
    "in @xcite we have studied a particle confined to the surface of an infinitely extended cone and bound to its tip by a @xmath0 potential . as illustrated in figure [ cone ] , a cone is obtained from the plane by removing a wedge of deficit angle @xmath123 and gluing the open ends back together . as a consequence ,",
    "the polar angle @xmath124 no longer extends from @xmath125 to @xmath126 , but only to @xmath127 .",

    "remarkably , as a consequence of @xmath93 not being self - adjoint in the domain of the hamiltonian , some of the corresponding multiplets were found to have fractional `` spin '' and unusual degeneracies .    in this section",
    "we extend the discussion to a particle confined to the surface of a finite circular cone with general perfectly reflecting boundary conditions characterized by the self - adjoint extension parameter @xmath21 .",
    "again , the particle is bound to the tip of the cone by a @xmath0 potential , i.e.  we consider a hydrogen atom with the proton residing at the tip of the cone .",
    "it is useful to rescale the polar angle such that it again covers the full interval , i.e.@xmath129,\\ ] ] with the scale factor @xmath130 the hamiltonian then takes the form @xmath131 it should be noted that on the cone the centrifugal barrier is modified by the additional factor @xmath132 .",

    ", the runge - lenz vector is in general not self - adjoint in that domain , and hence it does not generate a proper accidental symmetry .",
    "still , if the deficit angle @xmath123 is a rational fraction of @xmath126 ( i.e.  if @xmath138 with @xmath139 ) , @xmath140 applications of @xmath91 lead back into the domain of the hamiltonian , and hence a remnant of the accidental symmetry is still present .",

    "however , this alone does not guarantee that it belongs to the domain of the hamiltonian .",
    "for this to be the case , the wave function must also obey the boundary condition @xmath143 .",

    "hence , if @xmath147 , even on a finite cone a remnant of the accidental symmetry generated by the runge - lenz vector persists . in this case , the accidental symmetry gives rise to the degeneracy of states with angular momentum @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
