    "let s consider qcd with a heavy flavour @xmath0 with mass @xmath1 and a number of light flavours .",
    "we shall be interested in problems with a single heavy quark staying approximately at rest .",
    "more exactly , let @xmath2 be the characteristic momentum scale .",
    "we shall assume that the heavy quark has the momentum @xmath3 and the energy @xmath4 ; light quarks and gluons have momenta @xmath5 and energies @xmath6 .",
    "heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) is an effective field theory constructed to reproduce qcd results for such problems expanded up to some order in @xmath7 . in practice ,",
    "only a few first orders in @xmath8 expansion are considered , because complexity of the theory grows fast with the order .",
    "let s start from the qcd lagrangian @xmath9 where @xmath0 is the heavy quark field , and dots mean all the terms with light quarks and gluons .",
    "the free heavy quark lagrangian @xmath10 gives the dependence of the energy on the momentum @xmath11 .",
    "if we assume that characteristic momenta @xmath12 , then we can simplify the dispersion law to @xmath13 .",
    "it corresponds to the lagrangian @xmath14 . in our class of problems ,",
    "the lowest - energy state ( `` vacuum '' ) consists of a single particle  the heavy quark at rest .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to use the energy of this state @xmath1 as a new zero level .",
    "this means that instead of the true energy @xmath15 of the heavy quark ( or any state containing this quark ) we shall use the residual energy @xmath16 . then the on - shell heavy quark has the energy @xmath17 independently on the momentum .",
    "the free lagrangian giving such a dispersion law is @xmath18 .",
    "the spin of the heavy quark at rest can be described by a 2-component spinor @xmath19 ( we can also consider it as a 4-component spinor with the vanishing lower components : @xmath20 ) .",
    "reintroducing the interaction with the gluon field by requirement of the gauge invariance , we arrive at the hqet lagrangian  @xcite @xmath21 where all light - field parts ( denoted by dots ) are exactly the same as in qcd .",
    "the field theory  ( [ hqetlagr ] ) is not lorentz - invariant , because the heavy quark defines a selected frame  its rest frame .",
    "the lagrangian  ( [ hqetlagr ] ) gives the static quark propagator @xmath22 in the momentum space it depends only on @xmath23 but not on @xmath24 , because we have neglected the kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , in the coordinate space the static quark does not move .",
    "the unit @xmath25 matrix is assumed in the propagator  ( [ hqetprop ] ) .",
    "it is often convenient to use it as a @xmath26 matrix ; in such a case the projector @xmath27 onto the upper components is assumed .",
    "the static quark interacts only with @xmath28 ; the vertex is @xmath29 .",
    "the static quark propagator in a gluon field is given by the straight wilson line @xmath30 many properties of hqet were first derived in the course of investigation of renormalization of wilson lines in qcd .",
    "in fact , the hqet lagrangian was used as a technical device for investigation of wilson lines .",
    "loops of a static quark vanish , because it propagates only forward in time .",
    "in other words , in the momentum space , all poles in the @xmath23 plane lie in the lower half - plane ; closing integration contours upwards , we get zero .    the lagrangian  ( [ hqetlagr ] ) can be rewritten in covariant notations  @xcite : @xmath31 where the static quark field @xmath32 is a 4-component spinor obeying the relation @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the quark velocity . the momentum @xmath35 of the heavy quark ( or any state containing it ) is related to the residual momentum @xmath36 by @xmath37 the static quark propagator is @xmath38 and the vertex is @xmath39 .",
    "one can watch  @xcite how expressions for qcd diagrams tend to the corresponding hqet expressions in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "the qcd heavy quark propagator is @xmath41 a vertex @xmath42 sandwiched between two projectors @xmath43 may be replaced by @xmath44 ( one may insert the projectors at external heavy quark legs , too ) .",
    "therefore , any tree qcd diagram equals the corresponding hqet one up to @xmath45 terms . in loops ,",
    "momenta can be arbitrarily large , and the relation  ( [ qcdprop ] ) can break .",
    "but if we renormalize hqet , loop integrals become convergent . in them , characteristic loop momenta are of order @xmath46 , and one may use  ( [ qcdprop ] ) .",
    "renormalization properties ( anomalous dimensions etc . )",
    "of hqet differ from those of qcd .",
    "the ultraviolet behavior of an hqet diagram is determined by the region of loop momenta much larger than the characteristic momentum scale of the process @xmath46 , but much less than the heavy quark mass @xmath1 ( which tends to infinity from the very beginning ) .",
    "it has nothing to do with the ultraviolet behavior of the corresponding qcd diagram with the heavy quark line , which is determined by the region of loop momenta much larger than @xmath1 . in the conventional qcd ,",
    "the first region produces hybrid logarithms which are difficult to sum up . in hqet ,",
    "hybrid logarithms become ultraviolet logarithmic divergences governed by the renormalization group with corresponding anomalous dimensions .",
    "the hqet lagrangian  ( [ hqetlagr ] ) possesses the @xmath47 heavy quark spin symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the heavy quark spin does not interact with gluon field at @xmath40 , because its chromomagnetic moment is of the order of @xmath8 by dimensionality .",
    "therefore , we can rotate the heavy quark spin separately .    not only the orientation , but also the magnitude of the heavy quark spin is irrelevant in hqet .",
    "we can switch off the heavy quark spin , making it spinless .",
    "this often simplifies counting form factors in hqet . or ,",
    "if we want , we can make the heavy quark to have spin 1 .",
    "this leads to a supersymmetry group called the superflavour symmetry  @xcite .",
    "it allows one to predict properties of hadrons with a scalar or vector heavy quark ( appearing in some extensions of the standard model ) .",
    "this idea can also be applied to baryons with two heavy quarks , because they form a small size ( of order @xmath48 ) bound state with spin 0 or 1 , antitriplet in colour .",
    "hqet has great advantages over qcd in lattice simulation of heavy quark problems .",
    "indeed , the applicability conditions of the lattice approximation to problems with light hadrons require that the lattice spacing is much less than the characteristic hadron size , and the total lattice length is much larger than this size . for simulation of qcd with a heavy quark , the lattice spacing must be much less than the heavy quark compton wavelength @xmath8 . for @xmath49 quark ,",
    "this is technically impossible at present .",
    "the hqet lagrangian does not involve the heavy quark mass @xmath1 , and the applicability conditions of the lattice approximation to hqet are the same in the case of light hadrons .",
    "the main aim of these lectures is to discuss the methods used for calculation of feynman diagrams in hqet , and some of the simplest applications .",
    "these methods have much in common with the ones used to calculate multiloop diagrams in massless theories .",
