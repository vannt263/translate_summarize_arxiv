    "the statistics of nonequilibrium currents have attracted the interest of many physicists ( for example , see @xcite . )",
    "the statistics are related to the counting of the number of specific transitions in stochastic processes , and these problems have been widely studied in physics and chemistry @xcite . the general scheme for counting the number of transitions ,",
    "i.e. , counting statistics , has been recently developed ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and various exact and approximate analytical results have been found .",
    "for example , a stochastic system under periodic perturbations can exhibit a net current , a so - called pump current , and it has been shown that this pump current is related to the geometric phase @xcite . for the adiabatic case in which the change of the periodic perturbations are very slow ,",
    "an analysis with the aid of the berry phase is valid , and analytical expressions for the current ( the first moment ) and variance have been obtained for a specific case @xcite .",
    "however , to confirm these analytical expressions , monte carlo calculations have been performed ; precisely speaking , although the first moment can be calculated from solutions of the master equation , monte carlo calculations were needed to estimate the variance numerically @xcite .",
    "although numerical simulations are helpful in order to study such time - dependent systems , monte carlo calculations can become very costly , as discussed in @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we derive a direct numerical method to calculate moments of the probability distribution of the number of specific transitions in a stochastic process .",
    "although a numerical method to calculate photon emission statistics has been proposed recently @xcite , the method has only been applied to quantum systems .",
    "we will discuss in the following , with the aid of the generating function approach developed by gopich and szabo @xcite , a numerical method that applies to classical stochastic processes and in which the numerical effort to obtain the moments of the probability distribution reduces to integrating numerically a system of coupled differential equations .",
    "that is , this numerical method does not involve monte carlo type calculations . in addition , the method is applicable to a system under arbitrary time - dependent perturbations",
    ". it would be difficult in general to obtain analytic expressions for current statistics under complicated time - dependent perturbations , so that the direct numerical method will be useful for investigations of current statistics in nonequilibrium systems .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we explain the general scheme for the generating function approach .",
    "section 3 is the main part of the paper and the direct numerical method is presented by way of an example in the pump current problem .",
    "in addition , the validity of the proposed method is confirmed by comparison with the monte carlo simulations in section 3 .",
    "section 4 gives concluding remarks .",
    "we first explain the general formalism for the generating function of the counting statistics . although the formalism is similar to the one proposed in @xcite , we here present the general case in which the transition matrix can depend on time .    denoting the probability of finding",
    "the system in state @xmath0 by @xmath1 , a master equation for the system is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a transition matrix .",
    "the component @xmath4 of the transition matrix @xmath5 is the rate of transition @xmath6 , and it can be time - dependent .",
    "we here derive the generating function for counting the number of events of a specific transition @xmath7 .",
    "the generalization to multiple transitions is straightforward .",
    "firstly , we denote the probability , with which the system starts in state @xmath8 and finishes in state @xmath0 with @xmath9 being the number of transitions @xmath7 during time @xmath10 , as @xmath11 .",
    "the probability @xmath11 is obtained by repeated convolutions of the probability of no transitions , i.e. @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the convolution , and @xmath14 is the probability with which the system evolves from state @xmath15 to state @xmath16 , provided no @xmath7 transitions occur during time @xmath10 .    secondly , the generating function of the probability @xmath11 is defined by @xmath17 one can see that the generating function @xmath18 satisfies the following integral equation @xmath19    thirdly , we derive the time - evolution equation for the generating function @xmath18 .",
    "we notice that the probability of no transitions , @xmath20 , obeys @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the kronecker delta .",
    "hence , using the differentiation of the convolution , @xmath23 the time - evolution equation for @xmath18 is derived as follows : @xmath24 where we used @xmath25 .",
    "equation should be solved with the initial conditions @xmath26 .    finally , we construct the generating function for counting the number of the target transitions @xmath7 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath27 since @xmath18 is the generating function with specific initial state @xmath8 and final state @xmath0 , the generating function with specific final state @xmath0 is constructed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a probability distribution at initial time @xmath30 .",
    "hence the generating function @xmath31 is calculated as @xmath32 in addition , the time evolution equation for the generating function @xmath33 is given by : @xmath34 p_m(0 ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\fl & = \\sum_{i } \\kappa_{ni}(t ) \\phi_{i}(\\lambda , t ) - \\delta_{n , j_\\mathrm{a } } ( 1-\\lambda )   \\kappa_{j_\\mathrm{a}i_\\mathrm{a}}(t ) \\phi_{i_\\mathrm{a}}(\\lambda , t ) , \\label{eq_time_evolution_for_phi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and these equations should be solved with initial conditions @xmath35 .",
    "in order to explain the new direct numerical method to calculate moments in counting statistics , we use a simple stochastic model with two states ; the discussion is easily extended to general cases with @xmath36 states .",
    "the stochastic process with two states has been proposed in @xcite in the context of the pump current problem .",
    "the system consists of three parts , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] .",
    "the container can contain at most one particle .",
    "when the container is filled with one particle the particle can escape from the container by jumping into either one of the two particle baths , i.e. , the left reservoir [ l ] or the right one [ r ] . in the pump current problem ,",
    "the transition rates @xmath37 and @xmath38 depend on time , and here we set them as @xmath39 defining @xmath40 and @xmath41 as the respective probabilities of the container being empty or filled , the master equation is written as @xmath42    in order to estimate the particle current from the container to the right reservoir [ r ] we need to count the number of transitions from the container to the right reservoir [ r ] and the number of transitions from [ r ] to the container ; we should calculate the difference between them . according to section  2 , the generating function for the particle current",
    "is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 obey the following time - evolution equations : @xmath46 note that the transition from the container to [ r ] gives positive contributions to the statistics , so that we multiply @xmath47 by @xmath48 .",
    "in contrast , because the transition from [ r ] to the container gives negative contributions , @xmath49 is multiplied to @xmath50 .",
    "if we obtain the explicit solution of the generating function @xmath51 , all statistics of the particle current is estimated . however ,",
    "in general it is difficult to obtain the explicit solution of the generating function . instead of seeking analytic solutions , we proceed to obtain some moments directly via numerical calculations . to this effect",
    "we need to derive the time - evolution equations of the moments .",
    "firstly , @xmath48 in and is set to @xmath52 : @xmath53 where we denoted @xmath54 as @xmath55 for simplicity . because and are exactly the same as the original master equation , @xmath55 is interpreted as the probability in the original master equation , i.e. , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "next , the first derivatives of and with respect to @xmath48 are calculated and again @xmath48 is set to @xmath52 : @xmath58 hence , the first moment of the particle current is calculated as follows : @xmath59 = k_2 p_2 - k_{-2 } p_1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which recovers the well - known result @xcite .         the second and third ` factorial ' moments are also estimated as follows : @xmath60 = 2 k_2 \\left . \\frac{\\partial \\phi_2}{\\partial \\lambda } \\right|_{\\lambda=1 } + 2 k_{-2 } p_1 - 2 k_{-2 } \\left . \\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial \\lambda } \\right|_{\\lambda=1 } , \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath61 \\nonumber \\\\ \\fl & = 3 k_2 \\left . \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi_2}{\\partial \\lambda^2 } \\right|_{\\lambda=1 } - 6 k_{-2 } p_1 + 6 k_{-2 } \\left .",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial \\lambda } \\right|_{\\lambda=1 } - 3 k_{-2 } \\left .",
    "\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi_1}{\\partial \\lambda^2 } \\right|_{\\lambda=1}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the time evolution equations for @xmath62 are easily obtained , in a similar way to and . in numerical estimation of the time development of the differential equations ,",
    "all @xmath63 are set to @xmath64 initially , because @xmath65 does not depend on @xmath48 initially .",
    "it is easy to obtain the second and third moments from the above factorial moments .    in order to calculate the @xmath8-th moment",
    ", we should solve @xmath66 coupled differential equations .",
    "generally , when a stochastic process consists of @xmath36 states , we need @xmath67 coupled differential equations to obtain moments up to @xmath8-th order . hence , without using any monte carlo method , we can deterministically calculate the moments for the particle current or the number of specific transitions .    to confirm the validity of the new direct numerical method , we compare results obtained from the new method with those of the monte carlo method , i.e. , the time - dependent gillespie algorithm @xcite .",
    "the parameters are @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and the initial state is @xmath70 ( hence , @xmath71 ) ; the container is empty at the initial time . in one data",
    "set , @xmath72 monte carlo trajectories were used to estimate moments of the particle current .",
    "we repeated the monte carlo calculations , and collected @xmath73 data sets .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig_results ] correspond to the standard deviation in the @xmath73 data sets .",
    "although we can calculate moments at arbitrary time in the monte carlo calculations , we plotted only some points for reference .",
    "the results of the new method and those of the monte carlo method agree completely .",
    "in the present paper , a new numerical method to estimate moments for current statistics was proposed .",
    "the proposed method needs only time integrations of a system of coupled differential equations , so that the moments are estimated deterministically without the aid of monte carlo simulations . by way of an example",
    ", we explained the proposed method using a simple two - state model , but it is easy to apply this method to an arbitrary stochastic process with a finite state space .    in studies of a nonequilibrium current or nonequilibrium properties , it would be valuable to obtain detailed information about the statistics of the current .",
    "if one can obtain analytical solutions for the generating function , all statistics , including the probability distribution for the current , are calculated from the solutions .",
    "however , it is difficult in general to treat a case with a complicated time - dependent transition matrix . on the other hand",
    ", the proposed numerical method is available to arbitrary time - dependency , and we believe that the proposed method is both important and useful in cases in which an analytical solution of the nonequilibrium current is out of reach .",
