    "a decade ago , deep h@xmath0 observations indicated that some disk galaxies can support limited star formation at their extreme outer edge ( e.g. ferguson et al .",
    "galex imaging then surprisingly revealed that m 83 ( thilker et al . 2005 ) and ngc 4625 ( gil de paz et al .",
    "2005 ) have extended uv disks ( xuv - disks ) unapparent in the distribution of hii regions .",
    "we have since demonstrated that outer disk sf activity is commonplace , with @xmath1 1/3 of nearby s0-sm galaxies having discernible xuv - disk structure ( thilker et al .",
    "2007 ) . for detailed information , see the review by gil de paz ( this volume ) or thilker et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the relative lack of hii regions compared to uv clumps in the low sfr outer disk has been largely explained as a stochastic effect , tied to the very limited hii region lifetime compared to the time - scale for uv production ( boissier et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , alternative contributing factors ( top - light imf , low density ism ) have yet to be ruled out and motivate our hst analysis .",

    "visible imaging of eight xuv - disk fields was obtained for m83 .",
    "single locations in each of ngc 5055 ( fig . 1 ) and ngc 2090 are also being studied .",
    "we observed in four band - passes ( f150lp , f435w , f606w , and f814w ) using the wfc and sbc .",
    "optical observations of ngc 2090 were obtained using wfpc2 ( after the failure of acs / wfc ) .",
    "hst resolves the xuv - disk sources into loosely clustered complexes of individual stars .",
    "these complexes , likely evolved ob associations , are low mass ( @xmath2 m@xmath3 ) , intermediate age structures .",
    "only very few hst detections are consistent with being zero - age upper - ms stars having mass @xmath4 15 m@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "h@xmath0 emission is detected from complexes in which they are found .",
    "observed association sizes vary from 100 pc to @xmath1 500 pc with significant internal sub - clustering .",
    "the largest groupings may be blended associations .",
    "cmds ( fig .",
