    "in this paper we begin by studying certain growth functions of the free group @xmath4 , related to well - studied questions on the growth functions of geodesics on manifolds .",
    "the free group is a relatively simple combinatorial object , and this allows us to get fairly complete answers to our questions .",
    "our techniques , which are quite elementary , allow us to get precise results on the distribution of elements in @xmath4 as a function of their abelianization and in terms of their abelianization mod @xmath3 .",
    "our techniques turn out to be easily extensible to the study of paths in graphs with coefficients in compact groups .",
    "here is an outline of the paper : in section [ modsec ] we set up an equivalence between counting cyclically reduced words on the free group @xmath4 and counting circuits on an associated graph @xmath5 which , in turn , involves understanding the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of @xmath6 ( of course the answer is easily obtained , and is well - known ; for convenience we state it as theorem [ cycredno ] ) .",
    "we use this framework to obtain a generating function for the number of elements of a fixed cyclically reduced length with prescribed abelianization ( or homology class ) .",
    "this turns out to be essentially a chebyshev polynomial of the first kind ; see definition [ rfun ] of the function @xmath7 and theorem [ homoenum ] ( a very brief introduction to chebyshev polynomials is given in section [ chebint ] ) .",
    "the fact that the function @xmath8 ( at least for some special values of the parameter @xmath9 ) is a combinatorial generating function implies a previously unnoticed positivity result on chebyshev polynomials ; this result is generalized in section [ genanal ] in theorems [ nonneg ] and [ mnonneg ] .",
    "theorem [ homoenum ] is used in section [ limitu ] to derive a limiting distribution ( as @xmath10 tends to infinity ) of cyclically reduced words length @xmath10 among the possible homology classes . from the analytic standpoint this is also a qualitative result about chebyshev polynomials , complementing the positivity theorems [ nonneg ] and [ mnonneg ] . in section [ limitp ]",
    "we show that if we study homology @xmath2 , then the cyclically reduced words in @xmath4 are asymptotically equidistributed among the @xmath11 classes in @xmath12 we also succeed in estimating the extent to which the cyclically reduced words in @xmath4 are _ not _ equidistributed mod @xmath3 ( section [ bias ] ) .",
    "while the results in sections [ limitu ] and [ limitp ] seem to depend on the explicit generating function that we have obtained , in section [ graphs ] we show that our techniques are more general , and use them to study the equidistribution properties of long walks on regular graphs ",
    "we obtain a complete answer ( theorem [ walks ] )  and , without any change , closed orbits of irreducible primitive markov processes ( with a finite number of states ) .",
    "the arguments use elementary perturbation theory and the necessary technical results are contained in section [ perturb ] .    in section [ noback ]",
    "we extend our methods to study the functions defined on the _ edges _ of a graph , and as an application we derive the statistical properties of long walks _ without backtracking _ on the edges of an undirected graph .",
    "we apply our methods to derive equidistribution results for long walks with coefficients in compact groups in sections [ primedist ] and [ compgp ] .",
    "our results are completely explicit , in that knowing the irreducible representations of the group in question allows us to obtain complete asymptotics for the convergence to uniformity",
    ". our results also apply , via the construction of a directed edge graph to the statistics of `` geodesic '' , that is , backtrackless paths ( section [ noback ] ) .",
    "this , in turn , implies a result on the statistical properties of `` primitive '' orbits of markov processes as above .",
    "in section [ appsec ] we point out real and philosophical applications of the above mentioned result to group theory ( where this all started ) and geometry .",
    "finally , in sections [ gf]-[gf3 ] we derive a relationship between the number of cyclically reduced words and the number of conjugacy classes of bounded length .",
    "while the generating function of the first is a rational function , the generating function of the second is the integral of a lambert series with an infinite number of poles .",
    "these results are then extended to a slightly more general case than that of free groups .",
    "we then ( in section [ ihara ] ) compute a zeta function for primitive conjugacy classes , and show that this _ is _ a rational function .",
    "let @xmath13 be the free group @xmath14 , and let @xmath15 be an element .",
    "the defining property of @xmath13 is that @xmath16 is _ uniquely _ represented by a _ reduced _ word in @xmath17 , that is , a word where @xmath18 is never adjacent to @xmath19 ( notation : in the sequel we shall write @xmath20 for @xmath21 ) .",
    "we observe that such words over the alphabet @xmath22 are , in turn , be generated by walks on the graph @xmath23 , constructed as follows : @xmath24 has @xmath25 vertices , labelled with the symbols @xmath26  this peculiar order will simplify notation later .",
    "the vertex corresponding to @xmath18 is connected by an edge to every vertex _ except _ @xmath27 . in particular , there is a loop joining @xmath18 to itself ( so that @xmath23 is not a _",
    "simple _ graph ) .",
    "a walk @xmath28 gives the word @xmath29 , so the correspondence between walks and words is a @xmath30-to-@xmath31 mapping .",
    "note , however , that if we restrict our attention to closed walks ( circuits with basepoint ) on @xmath6 , then those are in bijective correspondence with _ cyclically reduced _ words in @xmath13 . in the sequel",
    "we will be interested exclusively with cyclically reduced words .",
    "to count cyclically reduced words , then , we need to count circuits in @xmath6 .",
    "this is a well - understood problem : if @xmath32 is the adjacency matrix of @xmath6 , then the number of circuits of length @xmath33 is equal to the trace of @xmath34 . to compute this trace",
    "we must compute the spectrum of @xmath32 , and to do this , it is better to write @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an @xmath37 matrix all of whose elements are @xmath31 and @xmath38 is the @xmath39 matrix such that @xmath40 in order to compute the spectrum of @xmath32 , we note first that the matrix @xmath41 has rank @xmath31 .",
    "the kernel of @xmath41 is @xmath42 while the vector @xmath43 is the eigenvector of eigenvalue @xmath25 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath38 is not much more difficult to compute : the vector @xmath44 is the eigenvector of @xmath38 as well as of @xmath41 , this time with eigenvalue @xmath31 . to compute the rest of the spectral decomposition ,",
    "let @xmath45 be an eigenvector of @xmath38 orthogonal to @xmath44 , and let @xmath46 be the corresponding eigenvalue .",

    "if @xmath56 , then we have the additional constraint that @xmath57",
    "so the eigenspace of @xmath31 is @xmath58 dimensional .",
    "putting this all together , we see that the spectrum of the adjacency matrix @xmath32 is @xmath59 we see therefore :    [ cycredno ] the number of cyclically reduced words of length @xmath60 in @xmath4 is equal to @xmath61.$ ]",
    "recall that the abelianization of @xmath4 is @xmath62 , generated by the classes of @xmath63 , \\ldots , [ a_r]$ ] of @xmath64 respectively . to compute the homology class of a word @xmath65 in @xmath4 we simply count the total exponents @xmath66 of the generators used to write @xmath65 .",
