    "the study of atomic coherence effects in multilevel atoms is one of the most active area in atomic spectroscopy  @xcite . especially , the theory of coherent population trapping ( cpt ) in a three - level @xmath0-type atom has been extensively studied and the phenomenon has been observed experimentally in a sodium vapor  @xcite , photoassociation systems  @xcite , bec  @xcite and solids  @xcite .",
    "the cpt results from the formation of a coherent superposition of the ground atomic states that is decoupled from the external fields and hence referred to as a dark state .",
    "the particular interest of this phenomenon consists of the possibility of storage and coherent manipulation of the population in a coherent superposition of the ground states of the atoms  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena have received greatly increased experimental attention in recent years and experimental techniques have been developed which allow a reversible transfer of quantum information from light to the dark state of the atoms  @xcite .",
    "the coherent population trapping has also been investigated in the context of lasing without inversion  @xcite , subrecoil laser cooling  @xcite and a search for materials that display a high index of refraction accompanied by vanishing absorption  @xcite .",
    "the atomic coherence effects are sensitive to decoherence . in the cpt effect ,",
    "one source of decoherence is fluctuations of the laser fields used to create the coherent superposition of the atomic ground states  @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations redistribute the population among the atomic states including the excited atomic states from which it can be spontaneously emitted resulting in optical losses .",
    "recent investigations of decoherence processes in atomic systems have demonstrated that cpt and quantum storage in an ensemble of noninteracting atoms are limited primarily by different decoherence processes such as atomic collisions , atom loss and motion of atoms  @xcite .",
    "the results show an interesting property that in the limit of the total number of excitations much smaller than the number of atoms , the decoherence rate of the multiatom system is of the same order of magnitude as in the single atom , i.e. is independent of the number of atoms in the sample . in an earlier study , jyotsna and agarwal",
    "@xcite showed that the cpt effect in a dense atomic medium is unaffected by local - field effects .",
    "it is well known that the dominant contribution to the decoherence processes in the interaction of atoms with the electromagnetic field stems from the thermal fluctuations .",
    "they are present in a non - zero temperature reservoir to which the atoms are coupled .",
    "the fluctuations cause a pumping of the population stored in the dark state into the excited states of the atoms from which it can be spontaneously emitted resulting in an increase in decoherence .",
    "the magnitude of thermal fluctuations depends on temperature of the reservoir and determines the minimum level of thermal decoherence .    in this paper",
    "we propose a method to suppress the decoherences that occur due to the thermal fluctuations of the environmental electromagnetic reservoir at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "essentially , we examine the cpt effect in three - level @xmath0 systems by addressing a practical question : how can one increase the efficiency of trapping and storage of the population in the presence of thermal decoherence .",
    "in particular , we will investigate limits to the efficiency of the cpt effect in a single atom and next will explore the role of multiatom collective behavior in the reduction of the single - atom decoherence rate induced by the thermal field .",
    "the dipole - dipole interactions between the atoms will not be taken into account here assuming lower atomic densities , so that the collective behavior we consider stems entirely from the mutual coupling of all the atoms with the common radiation field @xcite . employing the analytic solution for the density operator of the system",
    ", we find that in general the single - atom coherent population trapping effect , reduced by thermal fluctuations , can be significantly improved or even completely restored when the atoms interact collectively with the thermal modes of the reservoir .",
    "we are particularly interested in the manner in which multiatom effects can lead to a suppression of thermal decoherence .",
    "with appropriate selection of atomic parameters , we will find cases of almost perfect coherent population trapping in the presence of the thermal decoherence .",
    "our physical interpretation of the results is based on the semiclassical dressed atom model of the collective atomic system .",
    "the collective dressed states of the system are identified , and the effect of suppression of the thermal decoherence is explained in terms of the increased capacity of these states .",
    "this is shown to arise from correlation - enhanced transition rates among the multiatom dressed states , in particular those entering the trapped state .",
    "hence , the effects of decoherence by thermal fields may by reverted more rapidly .",
    "the system we consider is an ensemble of @xmath2 identical three - level @xmath0-type atoms each with excited state @xmath3 and two nondegenerate ground states @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the atoms are driven by two single - mode cw laser fields of rabi frequencies @xmath6 and @xmath7 and angular frequencies @xmath8 and @xmath9 significantly different from each other , so that each laser is coupled only to one of the allowed transitions , as shown in  fig .  [ fig-1 ] .",

    "the exited atoms may decay spontaneously due to the zero point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field from the state @xmath3 to both ground states @xmath4 and @xmath5 with the decay rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the atoms are contained in a volume with linear dimensions that are small compared with the radiation wavelengths , the dicke model  @xcite .",

    "fortunately , for the @xmath32 case and high field strengths , @xmath33 , an approximation technique has been developed , which greatly simplifies the master equation ( [ master ] ) and thus ables to perform analytical calculations of the expectation value of an arbitrary combination of the atomic operators . the restriction to the @xmath32 case stems from the difficulty in obtaining a closed set of equations when the two - photon detuning is present  @xcite . a full discussion of the technique is given in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the interest of brevity only the key results will be given here .",

    "before we proceed to the detailed analysis of the multiatom trapping effect , we briefly investigate the trapping behavior of single atoms in the presence of thermal fluctuations . in this way",
    "we may see what restrictions are brought by the thermal fluctuations for the trapping phenomenon and how they are related to the coherent driving process .",
    "coherent population trapping effect in a system of three - level atoms may be monitored experimentally in terms of the intensity of the fluorescence light emitted  @xcite .",
    "it is manifested by the disappearance of the fluorescence which , on the other side , manifests the vanishing of the population of the upper atomic states  @xmath60 .",

    "( [ fig-2 ] ) illustrates the stationary population @xmath61 as a function of the two - photon detuning @xmath30 .",
    "we have obtained the population by solving numerically the master equation ( [ master ] ) for @xmath68 .",
    "it is seen that in the absence of the thermal field , @xmath65 , there is perfect cpt observed at @xmath32 .",
    "when the atom is in the thermal field equally affecting both transitions , the cpt effect is reduced and the thermal field washes out the transparency window as @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the thermal field has a destructive effect on the cpt , because the thermal field is an incoherent field with random fluctuations that destroy the coherent process induced by the laser fields .",
    "the variation with @xmath64 of the minimum of the upper state population at @xmath32 can be analyzed explicitly using eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) which for  @xmath68 and together with the steady - state solution ( [ ss ] ) gives a simple analytical expression for @xmath70 in the form @xmath71    first , we note from eq .",
    "( [ up ] ) that the population distribution between the atomic states is determined solely by the parameter  @xmath49 .",
    "clearly , the population distribution and consequently the trapping effect depend on several parameters such as the laser intensity , spontaneous emission rates , and mean number of thermal photons .",
    "we can call the parameter @xmath49 as a measure of efficiency of the cpt effect .    here",
    "the efficiency of the cpt is examined in various intensity regimes of the coherent fields for equal and also unequal average numbers of thermal photons .",
    "the average numbers can be made unequal by a suitable choice of bandwidth of the thermal field .",
    "the selective excitation of the atomic transitions can be realized in practice by applying a finite bandwidth multimode thermal field whose bandwidth is much smaller than the splitting of the lower atomic levels , but large compared to the natural linewidths of the atomic transitions to satisfy the markov approximation used in the derivation of the master equation .    in the limit of @xmath72 that the thermal fluctuations affect only the @xmath73 transition , the parameter @xmath49 reduces to @xmath74 .\\label{xi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath49 does not change substantially with the rabi frequencies unless @xmath75 is much larger than the rabi frequency @xmath76 of the other transition . in the very strong - field regime of @xmath77 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath49 approaches the limit of @xmath78 .",
    "this minimum value is that one which leads to vanishing of the population of the upper atomic state , because @xmath79 .",
    "this predicts that perfect coherent population trapping can be observed even in the presence of thermal decoherence on one of the two atomic transitions , which is in contrast to the result of  @xcite .",
    "however , it requires that the transition influenced by the decoherence is simultaneously driven by a strong laser field .",
    "it can be understood rather easily . for a large rabi frequency @xmath75 , the coherent processes on the @xmath73 transition dominate over the incoherent thermal processes resulting in perfect transparency .",
    "various other intensity regimes can also be distinguished .",
    "if @xmath80 , the parameter @xmath49 can depend entirely on @xmath17 or @xmath18 depending on the ratio @xmath81 .",
    "for instance , when @xmath82 , we find that @xmath83 this predicts that the coherent population trapping depends entirely on the thermal fluctuations at the weakly driven @xmath84 transition . in the opposite limit of @xmath85 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath49 now depends entirely on @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the driving fields are relatively efficient in controlling decoherence in a single atom . again",
    ", it can be interpreted as caused by coherent processes that dominate incoherent thermal processes on the strongly driven transition .",
    "this also shows that the suppression of the thermal decoherence in a single atom is limited to the level set by the lowest thermal fluctuations affecting the atomic transitions .    in the case",
    "when the thermal field equally contributes to both atomic transitions , @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 independent of the rabi frequencies and the spontaneous emission rates .",
    "obviously , the trapping effect is reduced regardless of how strong are the rabi frequencies of the laser fields relative to the thermal fluctuations . in other words",
    ", there is no possibility of obtaining perfect population trapping or a control of the decoherence level in a single atom when both transitions are equally affected by the thermal field .",
    "a qualitative understanding of this effect can be obtained in terms of the transition rates ( [ trd ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig-3 ] shows the single - atom dressed states and the transition rates @xmath88 .",
    "one can see from the figure that the population flows into the state @xmath89 with the rate @xmath90 , and is removed from this state with the rate @xmath91 .",
    "the state @xmath89 is a linear superposition of only the ground states of the atom that it is the trapping ( dark ) state .",
    "therefore , we can call the rate @xmath91 a decoherence rate , as it transfers the population from the dark state to the upper state @xmath92 from which it can be spontaneously radiated resulting in an increase in decoherence and optical losses . only in the absence of the thermal field , @xmath93 , the transition rate @xmath94 .",
    "evidently , the cpt effect depends crucially on @xmath91 , and therefore the key to maintain a large efficiency of the cpt is to make @xmath91 as small as possible .",
    "it can be done when the thermal field unequally affects the atomic transitions , i.e. when the number of thermal photons affecting one of the transitions is different than on the other transition .",
    "single atom dressed states and possible transitions with the rates @xmath95 and @xmath91.,height=151 ]    for example , when @xmath96 , the rate @xmath91 can be made small , proportional to @xmath17 , by changing the ratio @xmath81 .",
    "it is easily to see from ( [ trd ] ) that in the case of @xmath97 , the rate @xmath91 is only of the order of @xmath17 despite the fact that there is a large number of thermal photons present on the @xmath98 transition .",
    "when the thermal field equally contributes to both atomic transitions , @xmath99 , and from eq .",
    "( [ trd ] ) we find that @xmath100 independent of the rabi frequencies of the laser fields .",
    "this is the smallest decoherence rate one can achieve in the single atom interacting with a thermal field that equally affects the atomic transitions .",
    "the limit is set by the number of photons @xmath64 that , on the other hand , depends on temperature of the reservoir .",
    "an improvement of the cpt effect in the @xmath101 type system with asymmetric spontaneous decay rates has been predicted in the absence of the thermal field @xcite , but in this case the transparency window shows a strong sensitivity to the rabi frequencies and is observed only in the limit of very weak driving fields .",
    "the limit set in single atoms by temperature of the reservoir can be circumvented to improve the efficiency of the cpt effect if one considers multiatom collective systems in which interatomic interactions can create collective states of a significantly enhanced storage capacity compared with the capacity of the corresponding states of individual atoms .",
    "the effects described in section iii can be seen in dilute atomic gases where the interatomic interactions are not important",
    ". however , a more interesting situation emerges as we have considered here atomic samples where radiative interactions between the atoms can lead to a collective ( entangled ) behavior of the atoms . here",
    ", we include the multiatom effects and calculate the population @xmath61 as a function of the number of atoms and the number of thermal photons .",
    "the upper state population @xmath70 can be evaluated using eq .",
    "( [ ds ] ) which , together with the steady - state solution ( [ ss ] ) , gives the analytical expression for @xmath70 in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath2 as @xmath102 .",

    "thus , for @xmath103 the collective behavior of the atoms does not affect the trapping effect .",
    "the presence of the thermal field has a destructive effect on the trapping phenomenon that the population in the upper state is no longer zero and increases with increasing number of thermal photons @xmath104 .",
    "however , the rate of the increase of the population decreases with increasing number of atoms @xmath2 such that for a suitably large @xmath2 the population @xmath61 may remain very small even for large @xmath104 .",
    "in other words , the thermal decoherence decreases with increasing number of atoms .",
    "thus , the collective interactions are relatively efficient in suppression of thermal decoherence such that the atoms may remain in their ground states even in the presence of the thermal decoherence .",

    "the dipole - dipole interactions between the atoms lead to a shift of these states from the laser resonance @xcite .",

    "we note in passing that the state in eq .",
    "( [ 4.3 ] ) is similar in form to that found by mewes and fleischhauer  @xcite , see also  @xcite , who considered collective quantum memories in three - level atoms driven by a classical field and a single - mode quantum field .",
    "the results of their work demonstrate that the dark states of the multiatom system are highly entangled states .",
    "however , the state @xmath150 which is the analog of the dark states found in  @xcite , is not entangled .",
    "thus , a question arises : why does the dark state @xmath150 is not entangled ?",
    "the reason is that the state @xmath150 is a linear superposition of all the collective ground states , whereas the dark states considered in ref .",
    "@xcite is restricted to having involved a small number of the ground states corresponding to a small number of excitations @xmath151 .",
    "it is easily verified that if we limit the number of the states involved in the superposition ( [ 4.3 ] ) to @xmath152 , then the resulting state can not be written as a product of the single atomic states . clearly , entanglement properties of the dark state @xmath150 depend on the number of atoms involved in the interaction with the laser fields , that only for @xmath152 the interaction can produce a dark state which is an entangled state .    to find the explanation why the cpt in the collective system interacting with the thermal field decoheres slower than the system of independent atoms ,",
    "we introduce the interaction between the collective dressed states and the thermal field .",
    "this interaction leads to a distribution of the population , initially trapped in the dark state @xmath150 , among the collective dressed states .",
    "let us look at the evolution of the population of the state @xmath150 .",
    "using the master equation  ( [ masterd ] ) , we obtain the following equation of motion for the population of the state @xmath150 : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the population of the state @xmath150 and @xmath155 are @xmath156 are populations of the following superposition states @xmath157 which differ in energy from the state @xmath150 by @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively .",
    "the states @xmath160 and @xmath161 are linear superpositions of the product states in which @xmath116 atoms are in state @xmath89 and one atom is in the state @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively .",
    "it is interesting to note from eq .",
    "( [ eqm ] ) that both spontaneous emission and the thermal field couple the state @xmath150 to only those states which differ in the excitation by one",
    ". moreover , the transition rates between these states are @xmath2 times larger than that for single atoms .",
    "this shows that the system is superradiant despite the fact that the state @xmath150 is the product state of the single - atom trapping states .",
    "in addition , the collective decay rate of the radiators entering the state @xmath150 is larger than that describing the atoms escaping from it .",
    "thus , the collective properties of the system are preserved due to the presence of the superposition states involving the single - atom states @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "in fact , the master equation ( [ masterd ] ) leads to a set of @xmath164 coupled equations of motion for the populations of the collective dressed states .",
    "fortunately , however , an explanation of the enhancement of the cpt effect , seen in figs .  [ fig-4 ] and [ fig-5 ] , does not require a complete solution for the populations of the dressed states .",
    "it is enough to consider only the population of the state @xmath160 or @xmath161 .",
    "thus , using eqs .",
    "( [ ds ] ) and ( [ rab ] ) , we can show that for @xmath68 the stationary population of the state @xmath160 is simply equal to @xmath165 , and for @xmath31 is given by the following expectation value @xmath166 which can be evaluated using the steady - state solution ( [ ss ] ) .",
    "we also calculate the population of the state @xmath160 in the case of independent atoms and find @xmath167 to see the difference between the populations ( [ 4.5 ] ) and ( [ 4.6 ] ) , we study the ratio @xmath168 .",
    "figure [ fig-7 ] shows the ratio for different numbers of atoms . for @xmath68 ,",
    "the ratio is equal to one , but for @xmath31 the ratio is smaller than one and decreases with @xmath2 .",
    "this shows that the population of the collective states is larger than the population of the equivalent states of independent atoms . in other words",
    ", we may say that the capacity of the collective states is larger than the capacity of the equivalent states of independent atoms .",
    "the ratio @xmath168 as a function of @xmath169 for different numbers of atoms : @xmath170 ( solid line ) , @xmath171 ( dashed line ) , @xmath172 ( short dashed line).,height=151 ]    the above analysis give us a simple physical interpretation of the collective trapping effect .",
    "we may conclude that the improvement of trapping effect by multiatom system is due simply to the increased storage capacity of the collective ( entangled ) states compared with the storage capacity of the equivalent states of independent atoms .",
    "we have investigated the coherent population trapping effect in a collective system of three level atoms driven by two coherent laser fields and simultaneously coupled to the reservoir of a non - zero temperature . the thermal reservoir causes thermal decoherence which affects the trapping effect .",
    "we have shown that in a single atom there is no perfect cpt when both atomic transitions are affected by thermal decoherence .",
    "the perfect cpt may occur when only one of the two atomic transitions is affected by thermal decoherence . extending the analysis to multi - atom systems",
    ", we have shown that the destructive effect of the thermal decoherence on the cpt can be circumvented by the collective behavior of the atoms .",
    "unlike the case of noninteracting atoms in which decoherence processes are independent of the number of atoms , we have found that the collective behavior of the atoms can substantially improve the trapping effect destroyed by the thermal decoherence . in the collective atomic system the trapping effect increases with increasing number of atoms . if number of atoms is large enough , an almost complete cpt is observed even at high temperatures of the reservoir .",
    "this feature is explained in terms of the semiclassical dressed atom model .",
    "we have shown that the improvement of the cpt trapping in the multiatom system arises from the presence of collective ( entangled ) states whose capacity of storage of the atomic population is larger than the corresponding states of independent atoms .",
