    "most of biologically relevant macromolecules , or particles in soft - matter systems are charged and repel each other with screened electrostatic forces @xcite . on the other hand , complex solvents in biological or soft - matter systems may induce effective attraction between the macromolecules .",
    "important examples of the effective attraction include depletion forces resulting from the presence of small objects like nonadsorbing polymers @xcite , solvophobic attraction @xcite or thermodynamic casimir forces @xcite resulting from critical adsorption near a critical demixing point in a binary ( or multicomponent ) solvent .",
    "the sum of all interactions has often the form of short - range attraction long - range repulsion ( salr ) potential @xcite .",
    "despite of the importance of the salr potential for biological and soft - matter systems only preliminary and incomplete results for phase diagrams have been obtained so far @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the phase diagrams depend on the strength of the repulsion , and for strong enough repulsion can be completely different than in simple fluids . in the latter systems",
    "the phase behavior is determined by the competition between the entropy favoring the disordered phase and the energy favoring formation of a spherical droplet of the dense phase .",
    "volume fraction of the particles determines only the size of this droplet . in the case of the salr potential",
    "there is additional competition between the energy and the chemical potential ( or the volume fraction ) of particles .",
    "the salr potential favors formation of spherical clusters whose size is determined by the range of the attraction , and the distance between the clusters is determined by the range of the repulsion . the structure minimizing the energy is possible only for sufficiently small volume fraction , however .",
    "the increase of the chemical potential leads to transitions from spherical to cylindrical clusters , next to a network , then to layers of particles , and finally to inverse structures ( occupied regions replaced by voids ) @xcite .",
    "regions of stability of the disordered fluid and different ordered phases , as well as location and order of phase - transitions between them for various shapes of the salr potential are only partially known .",
    "the difficulty in determination of phase diagrams in experimental studies results from the presence of many metastable phases and large characteristic time scales , by which instantaneous rather than average states have been observed @xcite .",
    "the question of the average structure in thermodynamic equilibrium may be clarified in future confocal microscopy dynamical studies . in simulations",
    "it is much more difficult to study inhomogeneous structures with some kind of periodic ordering and moreover the results are restricted to the chosen form of interactions @xcite . in theoretical studies the results relay on approximations , usually of the mean - field ( mf ) type @xcite .",
    "validity of mf for the salr type potentials was only partially verified @xcite , and it is not clear which predictions of the mf approximation and to what extent are valid on a qualitative or on a semiquantitative level .",
    "preliminary results within field - theoretic approach show that fluctuations may lead to substantial modification of the equation of state @xcite and to a fluctuation - induced first order phase transition @xcite , as in magnetic systems with competing interactions @xcite . we should also mention that the accurate liquid theories such as scoza @xcite are unfortunatelly limited to uniform phases , and only a lack of solutions is an indicator of possible phases with periodic ordering on the mesoscopic length scale @xcite .",
    "further studies including comparison between mf type results and simulations , as in ref .",
    "@xcite are necessary",
    ". it would be also desirable to introduce a simple model that could be solved exactly .",
    "exact results could serve for testing general theoretical predictions and for verification of the range of validity of approximate theories .",
    "no simple model that could play the same role as the two dimensional ising model played for simple systems was proposed so far .",
    "an exactly solvable two - dimensional model for the salr potential can not be proposed at the moment . to fill this gap",
    "at least partially , we introduce in this work a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice model with attraction @xmath0 between the first and repulsion @xmath1 between the third neighbors .",
    "exact solutions can be obtained for the equation of state ( eos ) as well as for the density and the correlation function for the whole range of @xmath4 .",
    "there are no phase transitions in 1d models with finite range of interactions , but pseudo - phase transitions may exist for low temperatures .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to compare the exact and mf results .",
    "it is also of interest to compare thermodynamics and structure of the disordered phase in simple fluid and in the salr - potential systems .",
    "the results can give interesting information about pretransitional ordering in the latter systems .",
    "effects of the precursors of the ordered structures on structure , compressibility and specific heat were already studied in approximate theories and in simulations @xcite . based on the exact results for the correlation function and for the eos",
    ", we can verify if the repulsion can lead to significantly increased compressibility and to oscillatory decay of correlations on a mesoscopic length scale , as found in ref.@xcite .    in mf phase transitions",
    "are present even in one dimension , therefore mf in 1d systems can shed light on some general features of phase diagrams in two or three dimensions .",
    "formation of living ( or dynamic ) clusters may be associated with large energy fluctuations , especially when the clusters easily form or dissociate .",
    "the specific heat in the salr system was studied in ref.@xcite . for fixed densities",
    "the maximum of the specific heat at some temperature was interpreted as a signature of the transition between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous fluids . to calculate the specific heat in our model we perform monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in the canonical ensemble .",
    "we calculate the specific heat for several temperatures as function of density for strong and for weak repulsion .",
    "the one dimensional model considered here , apart from yielding general information on periodic ordering in the salr - potential systems , describes several physical systems that are interesting by their own . in the first place it can represent charged particles in a presence of depletant at a three - phase coexistence line , or adsorbed at nanotubes or microtubules",
    "another example is a linear backbone polymer with monomers containing sites binding particles or ions that attract or repel each other when bound to first or third neighbors on the backbone respectively .",
    "our model can answer the question of spontaneous formation of ordered periodic patterns on linear substrates .    in the next section",
    "the model is introduced and the ground state is determined and discussed .",
    "sec.3 is devoted to the mf approximation .",
    "exact results and mc simulations are described in secs.4 and 5 respectively .",

    "such a state can be interpreted as a cluster fluid that can be stable , however , for a single value of the chemical potential , @xmath55 .",
    "when @xmath58 , the lowest value of @xmath52 corresponds to @xmath59 , and the periodic phase with period 6 is stable .",
    "the gas and periodic phases coexist for @xmath55 .",
    "because of this coexistence , arbitrary separation between the clusters , whose number is also arbitrary ( but smaller than @xmath60 ) , can be interpreted as arbitrarily small droplets ( larger than @xmath61 in the case of the periodic phase ) of these phases . as a result , an arbitrary number of interfaces can be formed .",
    "this is possible when the surface tension between the gas and the periodic phases vanishes .    similarly ,",
    "creation of a triple of empty sites in the fully occupied lattice leads to the change of @xmath56 which is @xmath62 . at the coexistence between the fully occupied lattice and the periodic phase @xmath63 , hence the separation between the three empty neighboring cells ( bubbles ) can be arbitrary ( but @xmath64 ) .",
    "again , such a state can be interpreted as a fluid of bubbles , or as a coexistence between the liquid and periodic phases in the case of vanishing surface tension .",
    "note the similarity between this property of our model and the very low surface tension between water- or oil- rich phases and microemulsion . at @xmath54 formation of the microemulsion",
