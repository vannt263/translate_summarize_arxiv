    "-than - nyquist signaling ( ftns )  @xcite  @xcite is considered as one of key technologies for the fifth generation ( 5 g ) mobile communications systems  @xcite .",
    "ftns can increase the transmission rate without increasing the required frequency bandwidth by transmitted modulated symbols with the rate faster than the nyquist rate , which ensures inter - symbol interference ( isi)-free transmission in band limiting channels .",
    "it has been analytically shown that the minimum euclidean distance between sequences of binary phase shift keying ( bpsk ) symbols using sinc - pulse does not degrade even with the rate 25% faster than nyquist rate .",
    "this means that , if the maximum likelihood sequence estimation ( mlse ) is employed at the receiver , transmission rate can be increased by 25% without the degradation of the bit error rate ( ber ) performance .",
    "however , the mlse requires high computational complexity , especially , when the isis due to the transmitting / receiving filters as well as the frequency selective fading channel are simultaneously compensated .    to reduce the complexity , the ftns receiver using",
    "frequency domain equalization ( fde )  @xcite has been recently proposed as a sub - optimal method in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the idea of  @xcite has been extended to the method using frequency domain decision - feedback equalizer in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the fde - aided soft decision and the multistage serially concatenated turbo architecture are applied for the ftns demodulator in  @xcite . however",
    ", these conventional fde - based receivers require the insertion of the guard interval  ( gi ) such as cyclic prefix ( cp ) at the transmitter , which results in the reduction of the effective transmission rate .",
    "moreover , the colored noise , which is inherent in the received signal of the ftns , is not explicitly considered in  @xcite and  @xcite , while  @xcite takes the colored noise into consideration but with the limitation that the sampling rate at the receiving filter is assumed to be twice the symbol rate in the formulation .",
    "this letter proposes an ftns transceiver using overlap fde  @xcite@xcite , which has been originally proposed for the fde systems with insufficient cp or without cp .",
    "since the overlap fde does not require the insertion of any cp at the transmitter at the cost of slight increase in computational complexity at the receiver , the proposed scheme can improve the spectral efficiency with the moderate complexity .",
    "also , we adopt the fde weight based on minimum mean square error  ( mmse ) criterion in order to take into account for the impact of the colored noise , and derive approximated one - tap fde weight to reduce the computational complexity for the equalization .",
    "computer simulation results show that there is a significant difference in ber performance between the receivers using fde weights with and without considerations of the impact of the colored noise .",
    "moreover , we show that the proposed method can achieve better ber performance than that of the ftns transceiver using conventional fde with cp  @xcite for a fixed transmission rate .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve 30% higher transmission rate than that of nyquist rate without performance degradation , when root raised cosine ( rc ) filter with the roll off factor of 0.5 is used for transmitting and receiving filters .",
    "fig.[ftnm ] shows the configuration of the ftns transmission system model considered in this letter .",
    "the transmitted symbol @xmath0,\\ ( n \\in \\mathbb{z})$ ] is generated by baseband modulation with psk ( phase shift keying ) or qam ( quadrature amplitude modulation ) using the binary sequence from the data source .",
    "we assume @xmath1\\}=0 $ ] and @xmath1s^*[m]\\}=\\sigma_{\\mathrm{s}}^2\\delta[n - m]$ ] , where @xmath2 represents the expectation , superscript @xmath3 a complex conjugate , and @xmath4 $ ] kronecker delta .",
    "the sequence of @xmath0 $ ] is transmitted after passing through the transmitting filter @xmath5 at the interval of @xmath6 . here ,",
    "we assume @xmath5 to be the root nyquist filter with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 satisfies the nyquist criterion for the symbol period of of @xmath9 . in ftns , in order to increase the transmission rate , @xmath6 is set to be less than @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath10 .    the received signal after matched - filtering with @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 q(t - mt ) + \\eta ( t),\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the impulse response of channel including the impact of the frequency selective channel @xmath14 and transmitting / receiving filters and is given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the noise component given by @xmath17 where the white noise @xmath18 follows the complex - valued gaussian distribution @xmath19 .",
    "the received signal is sampled with the sampling period of @xmath6 , which is the same as the symbol period , then the @xmath20th sample is given by @xmath21 = r(nt)=\\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty}q[n - m ] s[m ]   + \\eta[n],\\ ] ] where @xmath22=q(nt)$ ] and @xmath23=\\eta(nt)$ ] .",
    "note that the mean and the correlation of the sampled noise @xmath23 $ ] are given by @xmath24\\ } = 0 $ ] and @xmath24\\eta^*[m]\\}=n_0 g((n - m)t)$ ] , respectively .",
    "in the proposed method , overlap fde  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite is employed to compensate isis caused by band limiting filters ( i.e. , transmitting and receiving filters ) as well as the frequency selective channel . since",
    "overlap fde performs equalization with block - wise signal processing at the receiver , while the transmitted signal need not be block - wise , we firstly give a block representation of the received signal . assuming that @xmath25 for @xmath26 as in  @xcite by truncating tails of the impulse response , a received signal block of size @xmath27 defined as @xmath28 : = ( r[k ] \\cdots r[k+n-1])^{\\rm t}$ ] , where the superscript t represents the transpose , is given by @xmath29 = \\bm{q}_0 \\bm{s}[k ] + \\bm{q}_1 \\bm{s}[k+n]+ \\bm{\\eta}[k],\\ ] ] where @xmath30     & \\hdots     & q[n_{\\rm min } ]   &                    &                 \\\\                          & \\ddots      &                       & \\ddots         & \\hugesymbol{o}\\\\                          &                & \\ddots             &                   & q[n_{\\rm min } ]      \\\\                                    &           &                       & \\ddots         & \\vdots      \\\\   \\hugesymbol{o }                            &                &                       &                   & q[n_{\\rm max } ]     \\\\ \\end{pmatrix } \\in \\mathbb{c}^{n \\times n},\\ ] ] and @xmath31 also , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the smallest integer not less than @xmath36 and the largest integer not greater than @xmath36 , respectively .",

    "thus , if we apply fde for @xmath41 ignoring the second term of right hand side of , which represents inter - block interference and isi components due to the lack of cp , the fde output is given by @xmath48 = \\bm{d}^{\\rm h}\\bm{w}\\bm{\\lambda}\\bm{d}\\bm{s}[k ] \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\bm{d}^{\\rm h}\\bm{w}\\bm{d}\\bm{q}_1 ( \\bm{s}[k+n]-\\bm{s}[k])+\\bm{d}^{\\rm h}\\bm{w}\\bm{d}\\bm{\\eta}[k],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is an fde weight matrix .",
    "since it is empirically known that head and tail of the signal block at the fde output suffer from the residual interference due to the second term of , only the middle part of @xmath50 $ ] is used as the output of overlap fde .",
    "specifically , discarding @xmath51 elements from the head and @xmath52 elements from the tail , the output of the overlap fde is given by @xmath53 = ( \\bm{0}_{m\\times p},\\bm{i}_{m},\\bm{0}_{m \\times q})\\bm{d}^{\\rm h}\\bm{w}\\bm{d}\\bm{r}[k],\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the size of the overlap fde output , @xmath55 represents the identity matrix of size @xmath56 and @xmath57 a zero matrix of size @xmath58 .",
    "the next block processing is performed for the received signal block of @xmath59 = ( r[k+m ] \\cdots r[k+m+n-1])^{\\rm t}$ ] in the same way as described above .",
    "then , we consider the fde weight based on mmse criterion .",
    "if we ignore the second interference term in , the mmse - fde weight can be obtained by solving the following optimization problem : @xmath60+\\bm{\\eta}[k ] ) -\\bm{s}[k]||^2 \\bigr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mmse - fde weight is obtained as @xmath61\\bm{\\eta}^{\\rm h}[k]\\}\\bm{d}^{\\rm h } \\right)^{-1}.\\ ] ] note that since @xmath62^{\\rm h}[k]\\}\\bm{d}^{\\rm h}$ ] is not diagonal due to the colored noise , @xmath63 is also non - diagonal .",
    "thus , mmse - fde is not achieved with one - tap fde , which may spoil the motivation to utilize fde because of the high computational complexity .    in order to reduce the complexity , the proposed ftns scheme obtains the fde weights by approximating @xmath62^{\\rm",

    "we evaluate the ber performance via computer simulations in order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method . in all the simulations ,",
    "binary psk is employed for baseband modulation , and root rc filter with roll off factor 0.5 is used for transmitting and receiving filters .",

    "[ result10 ] , we observe the ber performance of ( b ) is significantly better than that of ( a ) for the same transmission rate especially for smaller @xmath79 , which implies the importance to consider the impact of the colored noise . also , we can observe that ( c ) can achieve comparable performance to ( b ) for the same transmission rate , which demonstrates the validity of the approximation in the derivation of ( c ) .",
    "then , we demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach using overlap fde for the ftns transmission .",

    ", we can see that rmse values at the middle part of the block are significantly smaller than the head and the tail of the block for all the values of @xmath79 , and that we only have to remove rather small portions of the fde output , which means the increase in computational complexity at the receiver due to the employment of overlap fde is rather limited .    figs .",
    "[ result21 ] and [ result22 ] show the ber performance of the proposed ftns scheme using overlap fde in awgn channel and 10-tap frequency selective rayleigh fading channel having maximum duration of @xmath84 , respectively , for different values of @xmath79 used in fig .",
    "[ result20 ] .",
    "also , the performance of ftns using fde with cp  @xcite is also plotted in the same figures for a comparison purpose . in both schemes ,",
    "the fde weight of ( c ) is employed to cope with the colored noise , while ( a ) is used in the original scheme in  @xcite . in the proposed ftns scheme , @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "are set to be @xmath85 for the awgn channel and @xmath86 for the frequency selective fading channel . in the scheme using fde with cp , the length of cp is set to be 20 for the awgn channel and 36 for the frequency selective fading channel , and @xmath79 is set to be @xmath87 for the awgn channel and @xmath88 for the frequency selective fading channel , which results in the same effective transmission rates as those of the proposed ftns scheme . from the results in figs .",
    "[ result21 ] and [ result22 ] , we can observe that the proposed ftns scheme can achieve better ber performance than that of the scheme in  @xcite for the same rate .",
    "moreover , in both figures , the ber performance of the proposed ftns scheme with the rate less than or equal to 0.87 [ bps / hz ] is comparable to that of the nyquist rate transmission , which means that @xmath72 higher transmission rate than the nyquist rate transmission can be achieved with the proposed ftns scheme without ber performance degradation if root rc filter with roll off factor 0.5 is employed for transmitting and receiving filters .",
