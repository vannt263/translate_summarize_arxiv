    "single top quark production at hadron colliders is at present the only source of polarized top quarks . for the @xmath0-channel process",
    "it is well known that , both at the fermilab tevatron  @xcite and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite , top quarks are produced with a high polarization in the direction of the spectator quark in the top quark rest frame .",
    "( here we define the polarization along some axis as twice the expectation value of the spin operator in that axis ; the spectator quark in @xmath3 is the light quark @xmath4 . ) at the tevatron , the small statistics and large backgrounds did not allow to test this prediction , but at the lhc the situation has significantly improved .",
    "recently the cms collaboration has presented  @xcite the first measurement of the top polarization in the spectator quark direction , @xmath5 , measured at a centre - of - mass energy of 8 tev . as the top quark is unstable and decays @xmath6 ,",
    "its polarization must be extracted from an analysis of the angular distributions of its decay products in the top quark rest frame  or by the analysis of related observables . in  @xcite the angular distribution of the charged lepton @xmath7 from the decay @xmath8",
    "was used , because this angular distribution is the most sensitive to the top quark polarization .    in this paper",
    "we study the top quark polarization in the @xmath0-channel process not only in the spectator quark direction but also in two orthogonal axes , hence providing a complete description of the top ( anti-)quark polarization .",
    "we give for the first time expressions for the polarizations in these axes for a general @xmath1 effective vertex with anomalous couplings . the sensitivity to these non - standard contributions",
    "is also estimated .",
    "previous work  @xcite investigated the polarization in the spectator quark and helicity axes , and their dependence on one of the three possible anomalous @xmath1 couplings .",
    "let us review the basics of top polarization in some detail . introducing a reference system with axes @xmath9 in the top quark rest frame",
    ", the state of an ensemble of polarized top quarks can be described by a density matrix @xmath10 where @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is a vector in three - dimensional space , satisfying @xmath14 in general , and @xmath15 if , and only if , the top quarks are produced in a pure spin state .",
    "the three orthogonal axes can be chosen as follows .",
    "the @xmath16 direction is taken as the direction of the spectator quark three - momentum @xmath17 .",
    "then , @xmath18 is taken orthogonal to @xmath17 and the initial quark three - momentum @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is determined requiring that the coordinate system is right - handed .",
    "that is , @xmath21 with @xmath17 and @xmath19 in the top quark rest frame",
    ". the @xmath16 direction will be called ` longitudinal ' hereafter , the @xmath20 direction ` transverse ' and the @xmath18 direction ` normal ' .",
    "this denomination is motivated because in the @xmath22 approximation to @xmath0-channel production , @xmath23 , the vectors @xmath17 and @xmath19 determine the production plane , hence @xmath20 is contained in that plane and @xmath18 is orthogonal to it .",
    "notice that the momentum direction of the initial quark in the @xmath0-channel process can not be determined unambiguously in hadronic collisions ; we will deal with this apparent difficulty later .    in the sm",
    "we have polarizations @xmath24 computed for the @xmath25 process @xmath3 with the generator protos  @xcite , using cteq6l1  @xcite parton distribution functions .",
    "the longitudinal polarization so calculated agrees very well with the full next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation  @xcite , @xmath26 , @xmath27 for quarks and anti - quarks , respectively .",
    "in addition , several kinematical distributions are similar  @xcite which brings confidence that our results hold with a full nlo computation .",
    "note that @xmath28 is not zero for top antiquarks in the sm because the spectator quark is not the @xmath29 quark in the leading production process , @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the presence of new physics in @xmath0-channel single top production dramatically changes these sm predictions . here",
    ", we focus on possible @xmath1 anomalous couplings .",
    "the most general effective @xmath1 interaction arising from a minimal set of dimension - six effective operators can be written as  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the so - called anomalous couplings , which are zero at the tree level in the sm . at present ,",
    "the most stringent direct limits on them result from the measurement of two asymmetries  @xcite in @xmath35 production by the atlas collaboration , @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath38 $ ] with a 95% confidence level , assuming only one non - zero anomalous coupling  @xcite .",
    "( the combination with single top cross sections would improve these limits  @xcite . ) current measurements of the @xmath39 helicity fractions  @xcite by the atlas and cms collaborations give less stringent constraints , for example @xmath40 $ ] , @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 $ ] using the measurements in  @xcite with the full 20 fb@xmath43 data sample at 8 tev .",
    "the individual limits on @xmath44 and @xmath45 are expected to be of similar magnitude as those on @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , since for this size of couplings the quadratic terms @xmath48 , @xmath49 dominate over the interference ones  @xcite .",
    "current limits on @xmath50 from the measurement of the normal @xmath39 polarization in the top quark decay  @xcite are still loose , @xmath51 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "indirect limits on @xmath32 and @xmath33 from @xmath52 physics  @xcite are one order of magnitude more stringent than those from top decays , because their @xmath53-chirality flipping contributions are enhanced .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath34 , however , and indirect limits from @xmath52 physics are looser , @xmath54 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the variation of @xmath55 when a single anomalous coupling is non - zero is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptrue ] .",
    "the sm coupling @xmath56 is fixed to one from now on , and the range @xmath57 $ ] chosen for the anomalous couplings is of the order of the current direct limits .",
    "the dependence of the top quark polarization on anomalous couplings can be extracted from a fit .",
    "the correction factors for the total single @xmath0 and single @xmath58 cross sections with anomalous couplings are  @xcite @xmath59 where we have dropped the combinations of couplings with numerical pre - factors smaller than 0.1 .",
    "the polarizations are then @xmath60 for top quarks and",
    "@xmath61 for antiquarks .",
    "the reason for the appearance of imaginary parts of coupling products in @xmath62 , and not in @xmath28 nor @xmath63 , is clear in the @xmath22 approximation to the @xmath0-channel process .",
    "since the differential cross section is proportional to the squared matrix element , and there are no absorptive parts , they can only arise from traces of dirac matrices @xmath64 , with @xmath65 the totally antisymmetric tensor with @xmath66 , contracted with four different 4-vectors . in the @xmath22 process there are only three independent 4-momenta , for example those of the initial and final state light quarks @xmath67 , @xmath68 and the top quark @xmath69 .",
    "then , the fourth vector in a non - zero contraction must be the top spin vector @xmath70 . in the top quark rest frame ,",
    "the lorentz - invariant contraction @xmath71 is proportional to the triple product @xmath72 , which vanishes for @xmath73 in the @xmath20 , @xmath16 directions but not in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "the extra @xmath53 quark in the @xmath25 process affects little this argument , since it is mostly collinear to the beam direction .",
    "as we have mentioned before , the direction of the initial quark in @xmath3 that allows to construct our @xmath9 reference system can not be unambiguously determined .",
    "one has instead to choose between the two incoming proton beam directions by using some criterion  the goodness of which will be the fraction of times that the true direction of the quark is correctly identified . to select among the directions of the two beams one can use the momentum of the spectator quark in the laboratory frame , which most times follows that of the initial quark .",
    "this choice gives the correct answer 97% of the times for @xmath74 and 98% of the time for @xmath30 , which are the main channels for single top and antitop production , respectively .",
    "for the rest of channels the rate of correct estimations , which depends on the kinematics of the particular process , is smaller .",
    "this results in ` observed ' polarizations @xmath75 that are slightly smaller than the ` true ' ones that one would measure if the quark direction were certainly known .",
    "the polarizations @xmath75 can also be computed with a monte carlo .",
    "the relation between @xmath76 and @xmath75 is linear , and independent of the anomalous couplings in the @xmath57 $ ] intervals considered , as it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pvsp ] .",
    "the ranges of the polarizations displayed are those that correspond to varying @xmath77 and @xmath50 between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : ptrue ] .",
    "c +    the numerical relation between @xmath76 and @xmath75 is @xmath80 the numerical factor is the same for @xmath28 and @xmath62 because choosing either of the proton directions as the quark direction gives most of the times a minus sign in the normal and transverse directions .",
    "( notice however that the two proton momenta are not anti - parallel in the top quark rest frame . ) for completeness , we also give here the results for the lhc with 14 tev .",
    "the correction factors for the total cross sections with anomalous couplings are @xmath81 and the polarizations are @xmath82 for quarks and @xmath83 for antiquarks .",
    "we now come to discuss how to experimentally probe the top polarization .",
    "it is well known that the distributions of the top quark decay products are sensitive to its polarization  @xcite .",
    "let us consider for example the charged lepton , with three - momentum @xmath84 , whose direction in the @xmath9 reference system can be parameterised by the angles @xmath85 . integrating over @xmath86 , the polar angle distribution is @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a constant named ` spin analyzing power ' of the lepton , which equals unity in the sm but in general depends on possible anomalous @xmath1 couplings  @xcite .",
    "( nlo corrections to this quantity are small  @xcite . ) then , a forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetry based on that angle @xmath89    c +    is sensitive to @xmath63 , and its measurement has actually been used by the cms collaboration to measure the top polarization  under the assumption @xmath90 . the transverse and normal polarizations can be extracted from the azimuthal angle dependence of the double angular distribution @xmath91 .",
    "production , although the corresponding polarizations are not extracted . ] but it is simpler to consider the angles between @xmath92 and the @xmath20 , @xmath18 directions , which lead to two more fb asymmetries , @xmath93 in the transverse and normal directions .",
    "neither of these three asymmetries provides a model - independent measurement of the top quark polarization , as new physics in the decay vertex can enter the distributions through the @xmath88 factor .",
    "( in contrast , a model - independent measurement would be possible by the analysis of double angular distributions also involving @xmath39 rest - frame momenta  @xcite . ) however , if we are interested only in new physics yielding anomalous @xmath1 couplings , and not other dimension - six operators such as four - fermion ones  @xcite , limits on the anomalous couplings can be extracted from the measurement of these asymmetries , especially of @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "their respective dependence on @xmath77 and @xmath50 , given through the polarizations @xmath55 and the electron spin analyzing power @xmath88 , is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : afb ] . in the lower panel",
    "we also plot the dependence of the normal @xmath39 polarization asymmetry @xmath96  @xcite on @xmath50 .",
    "this asymmetry has recently been measured by the atlas collaboration , @xmath97  @xcite using 4.7 fb@xmath43 at 7 tev and provides the first direct limit on @xmath50 .    by comparing the dependence on @xmath34",
    "it is clear that the new asymmetries @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) have a stronger dependence on @xmath77 ( @xmath50 ) than the asymmetry @xmath98 measured by the cms collaboration .",
    "moreover , systematic uncertainties on @xmath99 should be smaller , since their sm value is zero , except in the case of @xmath94 for @xmath58 production .",
    "( one can compare with the cms measurement @xmath100 that has a relatively large @xmath101 systematic uncertainty . )",
    "we can reasonably expect that the experimental uncertainties on @xmath99 and @xmath96 will all be of similar magnitude , since all these asymmetries vanish in the sm , except @xmath94 for @xmath58 , and their measurement requires full kinematical reconstruction of the single top events , the main difference being that in @xmath96 the charged lepton distribution in the @xmath39 boson rest frame is considered . if this is indeed the case ,",
    "the sensitivity of the normal asymmetry @xmath95 to @xmath50 is a factor of 1.5 higher : from fig .",
    "[ fig : afb ] , for small @xmath34 one approximately has @xmath102 we can conservatively assume that the systematic uncertainties at 8 tev are the same as in the current measurement  @xcite , because the evaluation of systematic uncertainties usually benefits from larger data and monte carlo samples . in this case , the attainable limit will be @xmath103 $ ] , far better than the current one @xmath51 $ ] . from the measurement of the transverse asymmetry @xmath94 , a limit @xmath104 $ ]",
    "is also expected .",
    "this sensitivity is competitive with the current limit @xmath38 $ ] from asymmetries in @xmath35 production , which is already systematics dominated  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the comparison of our limits with the ones in  @xcite for the @xmath105 process is not easy , since those are obtained without taking systematic uncertainties into account , and the measurements we consider are dominated by systematics given the large data samples available at the lhc .",
    "in this paper we provide a complete description of the top ( anti-)quark polarization in single top production , by introducing two directions , transverse and normal , which are orthogonal to the already used spectator quark direction . given the polarizations in these three axes , @xmath28 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the top ( anti)quark spin density matrix can be determined and thus the polarization in any other direction can be computed .    for single top quark production the polarizations @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath62 newly defined vanish in the sm , while for antiquarks @xmath28 is of the order of @xmath106 , with @xmath62 still vanishing .",
    "this fact makes these polarizations very sensitive to new physics contributions , such as top anomalous couplings or four - fermion operators .",
    "we have focused on the former , giving the dependence of the polarizations on possible anomalous @xmath1 couplings .",
    "it has been shown that two asymmetries , involving the transverse ( @xmath28 ) and normal ( @xmath62 ) polarizations , are very sensitive to an anomalous coupling @xmath34 involving a dipole term of the form @xmath2 .",
    "their measurement at the lhc will likely improve the limits on @xmath34 .",
    "the expected limits on the real part of this coupling with 8 tev data are slightly better than the current ones at 7 tev , which are already systematics - dominated .",
    "the expected limits on its imaginary part should improve the current ones by a factor of 5 . and ,",
    "in any case , limits from these new asymmetries can be combined with previously known observables in order to improve the sensitivity .",
