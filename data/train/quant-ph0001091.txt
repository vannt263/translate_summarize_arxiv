    "it is only relatively recently that the importance of entanglement has been fully realised . not only ,",
    "as schrdinger emphasised @xcite , does it constitute one of the chief differences between classical and quantum mechanics , and the main obstacle to an intuitive understanding of quantum mechanics ; the recent discovery is that it is also a resource , yielding much greater capabilities than classical physics in information processing and communication ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore important to analyse and measure this resource .",
    "a full analysis has so far been achieved only for pure state systems with two component parts @xcite ; for multipartite systems there are several different possible measures of entanglement @xcite , the relation between them being incompletely understood .",
    "a full quantitative analysis of entanglement even for pure states of three - part systems appears to be difficult ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is to give a _ qualitative _ analysis of the entanglement of such states , using group - theoretic methods to classify the possible kinds of entanglement .",
    "the nature of the entanglement between the parts of a composite system should not depend on the labelling of the basis states of each of the part - systems ; it is therefore invariant under unitary transformations of the individual state spaces .",
    "such transformations are referred to as _ local _ unitary transformations , though there is no implication that the part - systems should be spatially separated .",
    "if the part - systems have individual state spaces @xmath1 so that the space of pure states of the composite system is @xmath2 then a local unitary transformation is of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a unitary operator on @xmath5 the set of all such transformations is a group @xmath6 whose orbits in @xmath7 are equivalence classes of states with the same entanglement properties .",
    "each orbit therefore corresponds to a complete specification of entanglement .",
    "the orbits can be classified by their dimensions , which are determined by the stabiliser subgroups of points on the orbit ; the relation is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an orbit and @xmath10 is the stabiliser of any point on @xmath11 i.e. the set of elements of @xmath12 which leave a point unchanged ( different points on the same orbit have conjugate stabilisers , which have the same dimension ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with pure states of three spin-@xmath0 particles @xmath13 @xmath14 we will show that for most states ( all but a set of lower dimension ) the stabiliser is discrete , so the dimension of the orbit is the same as that of the group @xmath15 classifying types of entanglement by the dimension of the orbit is therefore equivalent to identifying certain exceptional types of entanglement , which can be expected to be particularly interesting and important .",
    "one way in which this manifests itself is that any such exceptional entanglement is necessarily associated with an extreme value of one of the local invariants which form coordinates in the space of entanglement types , and from which any measure of entanglement must be constructed .",
    "the organisation of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the case of two spin-@xmath0 particles .",
    "the results here are well - known , but we include them for the sake of completeness and orientation",
    ". in section 3 we prove the general theorem about three spin-@xmath0 particles mentioned in the preceding paragraph .",
    "section 4 consists of the theorem concerning the association between enlarged stabilisers and stationary values of invariants .",
    "section 5 contains the classification of exceptional entanglement types in the system of three spin-@xmath0 particles , in which we examine all the states which are identified as non - generic in the theorem of section 3 .",
    "section 6 is a summary listing these exceptional states .",
    "they are illustrated by means of plots of their two - particle entanglement entropies in an appendix .",

    "a pure state of two spin-@xmath0 particles can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a basis of one - particle states .",
    "having fixed this basis , we can identify the state @xmath18 with the matrix of coefficients @xmath19 the group of local transformations is @xmath20 since the phases in the individual unitary transformations can be collected together . the effect of a local transformation @xmath21 on @xmath22 is to change it to @xmath23 so the condition for @xmath21 to belong to the stabiliser of @xmath24 is @xmath25 for a 2-particle state , we can always perform a schmidt decomposition , so we need only consider states for which @xmath26 i.e. @xmath27 where @xmath28 are real and positive . multiplying the stabiliser equation on the right by @xmath29 where the overbar denotes complex conjugation , and writing @xmath30 we obtain : @xmath31 for given @xmath32 we want to find the set of solutions @xmath33 with @xmath34 real and @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",

    "then @xmath60 so @xmath40 ( or else we d have to have @xmath61 which is impossible ) .",
    "thus @xmath62 and @xmath63 , giving the three - parameter subgroup defined by @xmath64 where @xmath65 can be anything in @xmath66    these results illustrate how the occurrence of a state with special physical significance is signalled by a change in the stabiliser . in case 2 above the states are factorisable , so there is minimal entanglement : the stabiliser increases from one- to two - dimensional . in case 3 , on the other hand , the entanglement is maximal as measured by the entropy of entanglement @xmath67 or equivalently by the 2-tangle @xcite @xmath68 ( see section 6 ) .",
    "we note that the stabiliser for these states is even larger , being three - dimensional .",
    "this association between an enlarged stabiliser and a maximum or minimum of an invariant measure of entanglement is a general phenomenon , as will be proved in section 4 .",
    "in this section we will show that the generic pure state of three spin-@xmath0 particles has a discrete stabiliser in the group @xmath69 of local unitary transformations .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of two particles , where , as shown in the previous section , every state has a stabiliser which is at least one - dimensional . in the course of the proof we will identify those exceptional states for which the stabiliser might have dimension greater than zero . for ease of later reference",

    "in this section we will prove that a three - qubit state which is exceptional in the sense of theorem 1 has a stationary value of some fundamental invariant .",
    "since any measure of entanglement must be such an invariant , this indicates that these mathematically exceptional states are likely to have a special physical significance .    by a `` local invariant '' we mean a real - valued function of the state vector which is invariant under local unitary transformations , and is therefore constant on each orbit .",
    "it is convenient to concentrate on polynomial functions , which can be regarded as coordinates on the space of entanglement types ; more general invariants ( e.g. entropy of entanglement ) can be constructed from these . since the generic orbit in the state space @xmath134 has dimension dim@xmath130 the number of parameters needed to specify such an orbit is dim@xmath135 dim@xmath136 such parameters , being constant on orbits , are invariants .",
    "the space of orbits is not necessarily flat , and it may not be possible to parametrise it globally with a single set of six invariants ( see @xcite ) : geometrically , the space of orbits is a manifold which may have several different coordinate patches ; algebraically , the algebra of invariants is not a polynomial algebra but is generated by more than six invariants which are subject to some relations .",
    "however , we can choose a neighbourhood of a state so that the algebra of invariant functions on that neighbourhood has six independent generators .    [ elastic ]",
    "let @xmath134 be the space of @xmath137-qubit pure states , and let @xmath138 be the group of local unitary transformations of @xmath139 let @xmath140 be a set of @xmath133 polynomial invariants which generate the algebra of local invariants in a neighbourhood of a state @xmath141 if the stabiliser of @xmath142 in @xmath138 has non - zero dimension , there is a linear combination of @xmath140 which has a stationary value at @xmath141    let @xmath143 be real coordinates on @xmath139 suppose the jacobian matrix @xmath144 has maximal rank 6 at @xmath141 since the @xmath145 are polynomials , the @xmath146 minors of @xmath147 are continuous functions , so if one of them is non - zero at @xmath142 it is non - zero in a neighbourhood of @xmath141 hence , by the implicit function theorem , the equations @xmath148 define a smooth manifold in @xmath134 of dimension dim@xmath149 these are the equations of a level set of the polynomial invariants of @xmath71 since @xmath138 is compact , its invariants separate the orbits @xcite and so is the equation of the orbit of @xmath150 which therefore has the same dimension as @xmath71 it follows that the stabiliser of @xmath142 is discrete .",
    "hence if the stabiliser of @xmath142 is _ not _ discrete , then the matrix @xmath147 has rank less than @xmath133 and therefore there exist scalars @xmath151 such that @xmath152 i.e. , the linear combination @xmath153 has a stationary value at @xmath141    note that this theorem does not guarantee that all stationary subspaces of any invariant will be associated with enlarged stabilisers .",
    "however , it does indicate that states with enlarged stabiliser dimensions are likely to have special physical significance .",
    "we will look for the stabilising subgroup of the group @xmath154 of local transformations , i.e. the group of @xmath155 where @xmath80 are all elements of @xmath156 and @xmath157 is an overall phase .",
    "we will start with the three - index tensor equation for the local transformations : @xmath158 where the @xmath159 s are the coefficients of the state vector and the @xmath160 s are the matrix elements of @xmath161 etc . using the @xmath162 notation introduced in theorem 1 , and partitioning the equation at the index @xmath163 : @xmath164 w{^{\\mathrm{t}}}\\ ] ] @xmath165 w{^{\\mathrm{t}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath166 and @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "the stabiliser is the set of @xmath169 such that @xmath170 and @xmath171    in examining the non - generic states , not covered by theorem [ tony s ] , whose stabilisers have potentially non - zero dimension , we will sometimes find it convenient to abandon the infinitesimal approach of theorem 1 and determine all finite elements of the stabiliser groups .",
    "we will now examine the apparently trivial case when either @xmath89 ( say @xmath94 ) is the zero matrix . in this instance",
    "it is possible to choose bases of the two one - particle spaces such that @xmath94 and @xmath95 become diagonal .",
    "we need therefore only consider the case @xmath172 where @xmath122 may or may not be zero . then the first stabiliser equation becomes @xmath173 therefore @xmath174 , and the other equation becomes @xmath175 where @xmath176 this can be seen to be the 2-particle stabiliser equation , but with an additional external phase factor  which for the sake of transparency later we will not absorb into @xmath34 .",
    "the fact that one of the @xmath89-matrices is the zero matrix means that states of this type are factorisable .",
    "the particle(s ) whose kets can be factored out in this way do not participate in the entanglement ( if any ) of the other particles and so we ll call these ` bystander ' particles , and states in which not all the particles participate in the entanglement ` bystander ' states .",
    "if @xmath95 is singular , we have the equation @xmath177 which , by the two - particle result reduces to @xmath178 with @xmath179 giving us the condition @xmath180 i.e. , three degrees of freedom .    if @xmath95 is non - singular , use section 2 to look up the appropriate 2-particle stabiliser .",
    "this comes down to whether or not @xmath181 which both reduce to @xmath182 which makes three degrees of freedom .    if @xmath183 , take @xmath184 .",
    "then we have @xmath185 so @xmath186 and one element of @xmath156 giving us four degrees of freedom .",
    "thus ( in the three spin-@xmath0 case ) factorisable states reproduce the stabilising group structure of the fewer - particle states that their sub - systems resemble .",
    "recall that in theorem 1 we chose particle 1 , with corresponding index @xmath163 , as the ` partitioning index ' which splits the original , 3-index state vector ` tensor ' problem into the more manageable form of a pair of coupled matrix equations .",

    "the partition index is sometimes useful .",
    "the effect of changing the particle labels ( repartitioning ) on the stabiliser is simply to permute @xmath80 as each particle s associated @xmath156 copy just follows its associated index .    in group",
    "theoretical terms , the operations of permuting the particles are unitary operations on three - particle states which , though not elements of the group of _ local _ unitary transformations , do belong to the normaliser of this subgroup in the group of all unitary transformations .",
    "states related by elements of the normaliser will have isomorphic stabilisers in the group of local unitary transformations .",
    "we are , of course , always free to change the basis that we use to describe states of any of the three particles .",
    "( this amounts to applying a local unitary transformation in the passive interpretation . )",
    "if the change of basis is described by the @xmath190 matrix @xmath191 for particle 1 , @xmath192 for particle 2 and @xmath193 for particle 3 , then the effect on the matrices @xmath80 is @xmath194 the effect on the matrices @xmath195 is the same as in , with @xmath196 replacing @xmath197 in other words , the group element @xmath155 is conjugated by the group element corresponding to @xmath196 ( namely @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 etc . )",
    "if we regard @xmath201 as active transformations , taking the state @xmath202 to a different state on the same orbit , then this is the basis of our earlier remark that all the points on a given orbit have conjugate stabilisers .      in theorem [ tony s ] the first step in the argument that is only generically true ( * gen 1 * ) needs at least one @xmath89 to be invertible for the argument to be valid .",
    "if both @xmath89 s are singular , we can choose our coordinates to put one @xmath89 , @xmath94 say , into diagonal form by an appropriate local transformation .",

    "@xmath336 therefore @xmath337 and the determinant of @xmath95 is zero after all : this case is type 1 non - generic , and is in fact a bystander case .      in this next stage of the calculation , we will assume that both @xmath94 and @xmath95 are non - singular , and move on to consider the failure of the assumption ( * gen 3 * ) . in theorem @xmath338 we obtained the equations @xmath339 where @xmath340 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath341 .",
    "but generically , this will not satisfy @xmath270 unless @xmath342 so that @xmath343 we will now examine values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 that allow @xmath344 to be non - zero .",
    "since @xmath344 is hermitian and traceless , @xmath345 is real .",
    "so @xmath346 requires @xmath347 i.e. , @xmath348 now we know that @xmath349 from these same equations .",
    "substituting for @xmath350 gives @xmath351 hence @xmath352 and so the eigenvalues of @xmath353 must be of opposite phase , namely : @xmath354    writing @xmath355 we now have @xmath356 the right - hand side of becomes @xmath357 by the cayley - hamilton theorem .",
    "thus @xmath114 must still commute with @xmath51    we now argue as in * case 1 * of section 5.6 and conclude that the state must be one of the slice states or , but with @xmath103 replaced by @xmath358      the assumption ( * gen 4 * ) stated that the only matrices that commute with the @xmath190 matrix @xmath296 are linear combinations of @xmath360 and @xmath65 itself .",
    "this fails only if @xmath65 is a multiple of the identity , in which case @xmath361 and the state is factorisable : @xmath362 so that particle @xmath338 is a bystander .",
    "the assumption ( * gen 5 * ) was the statement that @xmath363 is not hermitian unless @xmath364 suppose this is not true , i.e. , @xmath365 where @xmath366 and @xmath367 are complex scalars and @xmath114 is hermitian and traceless .",
    "to analyse states of this form , let us assume that the basis states of particle @xmath338 have been chosen by means of a schmidt decomposition of the three - particle state @xmath368 so that the two - particle states @xmath369 and @xmath370 are orthogonal .",
    "let us also suppose that the basis states of particles @xmath75 and @xmath137 have been chosen so that @xmath95 is diagonal .",
    "writing @xmath371 we then have @xmath372 and the orthogonality of @xmath373 and @xmath374 gives @xmath375    now from and the following line , the traceless hermitian matrix @xmath115 is given by @xmath376 since this is hermitian and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are real , @xmath377 now gives us @xmath378 so the state is @xmath379 ) .",
    "then @xmath95 is a multiple of the identity and @xmath94 is hermitian , so both @xmath22-matrices can be simultaneously diagonalised . since tr@xmath380",
    "this gives a state of the form @xmath381 relabelling particles @xmath338 and @xmath75 gives @xmath382 where @xmath383 and @xmath384 this is a slice ridge state .",
    "this completes the classification theorem .",
    "in this section we will summarise the findings of the previous section by describing all pure three - particle states with exceptional types of entanglement .",
    "we will describe their place in the space of all pure three - particle states , using the canonical form of linden , popescu and schlienz ( henceforth called the lps normal form ) from @xcite .",
    "these authors pointed out that any normalised three - particle state can be brought by local unitary operations to the form latexmath:[\\[\\begin{gathered } \\cos \\alpha |{\\uparrow}\\rangle \\left ( \\cos \\beta |{\\uparrow}\\rangle |{\\uparrow}\\rangle              + \\sin \\beta |{\\downarrow}\\rangle |{\\downarrow}\\rangle \\right ) \\\\",
    "+ \\sin \\alpha |{\\downarrow}\\rangle \\left(-t \\sin \\beta |{\\uparrow}\\rangle    + s|{\\uparrow}\\rangle |{\\downarrow}\\rangle + z |{\\downarrow}\\rangle    and @xmath122 are angles lying between @xmath225 and @xmath387 and @xmath388 are real and positive , and @xmath389 in accord with our remark at the end of section 3 , there are five independent parameters ( the sixth being the norm which we are taking to be 1 ) .",
    "states with different values of these five parameters are locally inequivalent , except that when @xmath331 or @xmath390 we may change the phase of @xmath391 which may therefore be taken to be real and positive ; and when @xmath392 all values of @xmath393 give the same state .",
    "we will also give an indication of the exceptional nature of these states and their physical significance by calculating their 2-tangles and 3-tangles .",
    "these invariants , which were introduced by wootters @xcite , quantify how much of the entanglement is contained in particular pairs and how much is an essential property of the full set of three particles .",
    "formulae for them were given by coffman , kundu and wootters @xcite .",
    "for a pure three - particle state , the 2-tangle of particles @xmath344 and @xmath114 is @xmath394 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath395 are , in decreasing order of magnitude , the positive square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath396 @xmath397 being the reduced density matrix of the pair @xmath398 , obtained from @xmath399 by tracing over particle @xmath115 , while @xmath400 are the reduced density matrices of particles @xmath344 and @xmath114 .",
    "the 3-tangle is @xmath401 which can be shown @xcite to be invariant under permutations of @xmath344 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the exceptional states are as follows .",
    "these are states which factorise as the product of a one - particle state and a two - particle state , so that the one particle is a bystander .",
    "they occur when the lps parameters have the values @xmath126 or @xmath402 or @xmath403 the state given by @xmath404 namely @xmath405 has the two - dimensional stabiliser @xmath406 unless @xmath407 when the two - particle state is maximally entangled and the stabiliser is four - dimensional : @xmath408 or @xmath409 when the state is completely factorisable and the stabiliser is three - dimensional : @xmath410 with @xmath411    the 2-tangles and 3-tangle of this state are @xmath412 @xmath413      these are states given by @xmath414 and their relatives obtainable by permuting the particles : explicitly , @xmath415 such states occur among the lps normal forms when @xmath416 and any two of @xmath417 and @xmath418 are zero .",
    "they have one - dimensional stabilisers each consisting of four circles ; for the first state listed above , the stabiliser contains @xmath419 where @xmath420 its tangle invariants are @xmath421 @xmath422      these states , which are those slice states that have maximal values of two out of the three two - particle von neumann entropies , occur when a slice state has @xmath423 i.e. @xmath424 in the linden - popescu normal form .",
    "in addition to the other slice stabiliser elements , they have a further one - dimensional set of stabiliser elements given , for states in lps normal form with @xmath425 and @xmath426 by @xmath427 where @xmath428 and @xmath58 can take any value between @xmath225 and @xmath246    the tangles of these states continue to be given by and .",
    "note that for given @xmath43 , the maximum 3-tangle occurs at @xmath331 , when the state belongs to the following class and the stabiliser becomes two - dimensional .",
    "occurring at the boundary of the set of slice states , these states are of the form @xmath429 they have two - dimensional stabilisers @xmath430 with @xmath431 or @xmath254 in lps normal form , these states have @xmath432 and @xmath433 these states have pure three - particle entanglement , since each of their two - particle density matrices is @xmath434 which is separable .",
    "this is shown by the tangle invariants : @xmath435 @xmath436      this occupies the same position among the generalised ghz states as the slice ridge states among the general slice states , occurring when @xmath437 ( @xmath424 in lps normal form ) , which maximises the 3-tangle .",
    "in addition to the stabiliser elements , it has the further two - dimensional set of stabiliser elements @xmath438 with @xmath439      we call  tetrahedral \" states of the form @xmath440 since when the eight coefficients @xmath91 are laid out in a @xmath441 cubic array , these states have zero entries except at the vertices of a tetrahedron .",
    "if all four of @xmath214 are non - zero , the state is generic .",
    "if one of them is zero , say @xmath390 , the state is of the form @xmath442 which has the one - dimensional stabiliser @xmath443 its tangle invariants are @xmath444 @xmath413    these states are , in a sense , the opposites of the generalised ghz states : their entanglement is concentrated in two - particle entanglement , and they have no three - particle entanglement .",
    "we have mapped the full range of entanglement properties of pure states of three spin-@xmath0 particles , using their behaviour under local unitary transformations as an indicator .",
    "we have identified all the types of exceptional states , and have shown that these states will have a special relation to certain local invariants . in future work",
    "we hope to identify these invariants , and to study more fully the variation of known invariants , such as the two - particle von neumann entropies , with respect to entanglement type .",
