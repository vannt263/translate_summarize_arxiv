    ". it is perhaps worth noting that this function @xmath29 is characterized almost entirely in terms of the prevalent covariance structure @xmath34 .",
    "the relative risk @xmath35 enters only indirectly , namely , in determining the family of sets ( [ e.3.a ] ) which are admissible for the covariance structure .",
    "put a bit differently , the only role  @xmath35 plays is to ensure the asset capitalization process @xmath36 takes values in @xmath37 .    under additional regularity conditions ,",
    "@xmath38 is the value of a stochastic control problem : the maximal probability that the diffusion process @xmath39 with initial configuration @xmath40 , values in the punctured nonnegative orthant @xmath41 of ( [ 1.b ] ) , infinitesimal generator @xmath42 and controlled through the choice of covariance function @xmath43 which satisfies @xmath44 for all @xmath45 , does not hit the boundary of the orthant @xmath46 by time @xmath47 . under appropriate conditions",
    "the function @xmath29 satisfies then , in the notation of ( [ e.3.d ] ) , the _ hamilton  jacobi  bellman _ ( _ hjb _ ) _ equation _ @xmath48 _ relation to extant work _ : stochastic control problems of the `` maximal probability of containment '' type were apparently pioneered by van mellaert and dorato ( @xcite ) ( see also @xcite , pages 157158 ) .",
    "the `` knightian uncertainty '' constraint imposed in ( [ e.3 ] ) is very similar to the formulation of stochastic control and stochastic game problems for one - dimensional diffusions pioneered by william sudderth , that sudderth and his collaborators developed in a series of articles that includes @xcite , heath et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite ; indeed , the developments in sections [ sec6][sec8 ] of our paper can be construed as a multidimensional extension of the sudderth approach .",
    "we rely strongly on krylov s ( @xcite , @xcite ) work , which studies solutions of stochastic differential equations with constraints on the drift and diffusion coefficients in terms of `` supermartingale problems '' and characterizes sets of stochastic integrals via appropriate supermartingales .",
    "the approach we adopt has a lot in common with the effort , started in the mid-1990s , to understand option pricing and hedging in the presence of uncertainty about the underlying volatility structure of assets .",
    "we have been influenced by this strand of work , particularly by the papers of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; other important papers include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ekstrm and tysk ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , whereas the recent preprints by @xcite ( @xcite , @xcite ) contain very relevant results .",
    "similar in this spirit is the strand of work by shige peng and his collaborators , surveyed in @xcite , regarding the so - called `` @xmath49-brownian motion '' which exhibits volatility uncertainty [ see also @xcite , as well as @xcite for extensions to settings where the range of uncertainty is stochastic ] .",
    "whereas in both these strands the relevant fully nonlinear parabolic - type partial differential ( so - called `` black  scholes  barenblatt'')equation has a typically unique solution , here the main interest arises from _ lack of uniqueness _ on the part of the rather similar , fully nonlinear equation  ( [ e.3.c ] ) .",
    "let us mention that optimization problems in stochastic control , mathematical economics and finance that involve model uncertainty have also been treated by other authors , among them @xcite , @xcite , shied and wu ( @xcite ) , @xcite , fllmer and gundel ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , bayraktar and yao ( @xcite ) , bayraktar , karatzas and yao ( @xcite ) and @xcite [ see also the survey by @xcite ] .    _ preview _ : sections [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] set up the model for an equity market with knightian model uncertainty regarding its volatility and market - price - of - risk characteristics , and for investment rules in its context .",
    "section [ sec4 ] introduces the notion of optimal arbitrage in this context , whereas section [ sec5 ] discusses the relevance of the fully nonlinear parabolic partial differential inequality of hjb type ( [ e.3.in ] ) , ( [ e.3.d ] ) in characterizing the arbitrage function and in finding an investment rule that realizes the best outperformance of the market portfolio .",
    "section [ sec6 ] presents a verification - type result for this equation .",
    "sections [ sec7 ] and [ sec8 ] make the connection with the stochastic control problem of maximizing the probability of containment for an auxiliary it process , controlled in a nonanticipative way and in a manner that affects both its drift and dispersion characteristics .",
    "finally , section [ sec9 ] develops yet another characterization of the arbitrage function , this time as the min - max value of a zero - sum stochastic game ; the investment rule that realizes the best outperformance of ( optimal arbitrage with respect to ) the market , is now seen as the investor s best response to a `` least favorable '' market model configuration .",

    "the interpretation is that the components of the driving brownian motion  @xmath92 represent the independent factors of the resulting model ; the entries of the matrix @xmath93 are the local volatility rates of the asset capitalization vector process @xmath85 at time @xmath94 ; the entries of the matrix @xmath95 as in  ( [ alphasigma ] ) represent the local covariance rates ; whereas the components of the vector  @xmath96 are the market price of risk ( also called _ relative risk _ ) rates prevalent at time @xmath4 . in particular",

    "this process @xmath101 plays the role of a state - price - density or `` deflator '' in the present context .",
    "just as in our earlier works , fernholz and karatzas ( @xcite , @xcite ) as well as @xcite  mostly in a markovian context , and without model uncertainty  an important feature of this subject is that @xmath101 has to be allowed to be a _",
