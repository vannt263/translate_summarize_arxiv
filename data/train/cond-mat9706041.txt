    "the cellular automaton ( ca ) approach to traffic flow theory @xcite has attracted much interest in recent years ( see e.g.@xcite ) . compared to the earlier attempts in modeling traffic flow ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) ca models can be used very efficiently for computer simulations .",
    "this makes it possible to perform real time simulations even for very large networks @xcite . due to the relevance of these models for applications",
    "it is important to understand the underlying physics thoroughly .",
    "the cellular automaton model of nagel and schreckenberg ( nasch model ) @xcite provides a simple but quite realistic description of traffic flow .",
    "the road is divided into @xmath0 cells so that the model is discrete in space and time .",
    "each cell can either be empty or occupied by one of @xmath1 cars @xmath2 with velocities @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 is assumed to be the same for all the cars .",
    "the update is divided into four steps which are applied _ in parallel _ to all cars .",
    "the first step ( r1 ) is an acceleration step .",
    "the velocities @xmath5 of each car @xmath6 not already propagating with the maximum velocity @xmath4 are increased by one . the second step ( r2 )",
    "is designed to avoid accidents .",
    "if a car has @xmath7 empty cells in front of it and its velocity ( after step ( r1 ) ) exceeds @xmath7 the velocity is reduced to @xmath7 . up to now",
    "the dynamics is completely deterministic .",
    "noise is introduced via the randomisation step ( r3 ) . here",
    "the velocities of moving cars @xmath8 are decreased by one with probability @xmath9 .",
    "the steps ( r1)(r3 ) give the new velocity @xmath5 for each car @xmath6 .",
    "in the last step of the update procedure the positions @xmath10 of the cars are shifted by @xmath5 cells ( r4 ) to @xmath11 .",
    "we consider here only periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus the model contains three parameters : the maximum velocity @xmath4 , the probability for braking @xmath9 , and the average density @xmath12 .",
    "a basic feature of traffic models is the relation between density @xmath13 and the average flow @xmath14 ( fundamental diagram ) where @xmath15 is the average velocity .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the fundamental diagram for different values of @xmath9 .",
    "one observes two effects as the noise @xmath9 is increased , namely a decrease of the flow and a shift of the maximum towards smaller densities . in the low - density limit",
    "@xmath16 one always finds free flow behavior with @xmath17 whereas for high densities @xmath18 one has @xmath19 .",
    "although the model can not be solved exactly for arbitrary parameter values , two limits of the model can be treated analytically .",
    "firstly the case @xmath20 which is solved excactly with improved mean field methods @xcite",
    ". here the fundamental diagram is symmetric due to particle - hole symmetry .",
    "considering larger maximum velocities @xmath21 one can obtain solutions only in the deterministic limit @xmath22 where the flow is given by @xmath23 in the free flow regime where @xmath24 all cars propagate with maximum velocity whereas in the jammed phase the flow is limited by the number of empty cells .",
    "these limits will be discussed further in the later sections .",
    "such a transition from a free flow regime at low densities to a congested flow regime where start and stop waves dominate the dynamics are quite typically for traffic flow .",
    "several attempts have been made to explain the nature of this transition in the ca model @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it seems , however , that no consensus has been reached yet .",
    "here we present results of an extensive numerical investigation of the parameter dependence of the transition in the nasch model .",
    "we examine several quantities which give information about the location @xmath25 and the nature of the phase transition .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section we discuss the relaxation into the steady state .",
    "section 3 is devoted to measurements of an order - parameter .",
    "section 4 shows the behavior of the spatial correlation function .",
    "our results are discussed in the final section .",
    "a characteristic feature of a second order phase transition is the divergence of the relaxation time at the transition point . for technical reasons csnyi and kertsz",
    "@xcite made no direct measurements of the relaxation time , but used the following approach : starting from a random configuration of cars with velocity @xmath26 the average velocity @xmath27 is measured at each time step @xmath28 . for @xmath29 the system reaches a stationary state with average velocity @xmath30 .",
    "the relaxation time is characterised by the parameter @xcite",
    "@xmath31\\      dt \\ .\\ ] ] @xmath32 denotes the average velocity in the acceleration phase @xmath33 for low vehicle density @xmath34 . because the vehicles do not interact with each other",
    ", @xmath35 holds in this regime .",
    "thus the relaxation time is obtained by summing up the deviations of the average velocity @xmath36 from the values of a system with one single vehicle which can move without interactions with other cars ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "one finds a maximum of the relaxation parameter near , but _",
    "below _ , the density of maximum flow for @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( see @xcite ) .    within this investigation",
    "we extended the set of braking parameters ( @xmath40 ) in order to study the parameter dependence of the maximum of @xmath41 .",
    "we took into account system sizes up to @xmath42 where the position @xmath25 of the maximum of @xmath41 becomes size independent .",
    "the transition density is given by @xmath25 of the largest system we took into account .",
    "the results for @xmath22 and @xmath38 are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "a comparison of @xmath25 with the density of maximum flow @xmath43 shows smaller values of the transition densities for all values of @xmath9 taken into account . taking the magnitude of @xmath41 as a characteristic value for the relaxation time one can estimate the dynamical exponent .",
    "furthermore the scaling behavior of the width @xmath44 and height @xmath45 of the peak has been taken into account , @xmath46 we find @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath38 .",
    "note that the peak is not symmetric so that it is difficult to determine its width .",
    "comparing our data with @xcite two facts have to be mentioned .",
    "first , our results for @xmath38 are completely different from the exponents obtained in @xcite .",
    "the second remarkable point is the occurance of negative values for the relaxation times ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "this effect is not shown in @xcite .",
    "one can think that it emerges from inaccurate measurements or finite size effects , but the negative values are a consequence of the definition ( [ eq : relax ] ) .",
    "if we look at the time evolution of @xmath52 we see the reason for this unpleasent feature ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) : for @xmath53 the system gets temporarily into states which have a higher average velocity than the stationary state such that @xmath54 holds within this time interval .",
    "this over - reaction is a consequence of the relaxation mechanism which can be divided into two phases for @xmath55 . within the first few time steps small clusters which occur in the initial configuration vanish .",
    "the second phase is characterized by the growth of surviving jams .",
    "more and more cars get trapped into large jams and therefore the average flow decreases to its stationary value .",
    "this decrease causes negative values of @xmath41 at large densities .    finally one should note that ( [ eq : relax ] ) can only be interpreted as a relaxation time for a purely exponential decay , @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows , however , that this is not the case for @xmath57 , where one even finds a non - monotonic relaxational behavior . in order to get a clear picture of the nature of the transition one should therefore examine various quantities .",
    "for a proper description of the transition one should introduce an order parameter which has a qualitative different behavior within the two phases . a first candidate would be the analogue of the magnetisation in the ising model , i.e.  the number of cars .",
    "however , since this quantity is conserved in the nasch model it can not serve as an order parameter .",
    "therefore the density of nearest neighbour pairs @xmath58 with @xmath59 for an empty cell and @xmath60 for a cell occupied by a car ( irrespective of its velocity ) , is the simplest choice of a local quantity with a nontrivial behavior at the transition density .",
    "taking into account the braking rule ( r2 ) @xmath61 gives the density of those cars with velocity @xmath62 which had to brake due to the next car ahead .",
    "although the order parameter introduced in @xcite is defined as a time average it shows a quite similar behavior . for large time periods",
    "it measures the densities of cars with velocity 0 @xcite .",
    "vilar et al .",
    "@xcite only investigated the deterministic case @xmath22 for which their order parameter is identical to ours , but also in the presence of noise the values differ only slightly .",
    "first we will discuss the behavior of the order parameter in the case @xmath22 .",
    "below the transition density , @xmath63 the order parameter vanishes because every car has at least @xmath4 empty sites in front and propagates with @xmath4 . within the jammed phase the flow is limited by the number of empty cells and also stopped cars occur . in the presence of noise the behavior of the order parameter qualitativly changes in the vicinity of the transition density",
    ". within this region @xmath61 decays exponentially .",
    "assuming @xmath61 is a possible choice for the order parameter this implies the absence of criticality in the nondeterministic case .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows that the order parameter does not exhibit a sharp transition .",
    "although it becomes rather small for small densities it is still different from zero .",
    "the situation is quite similar to the behavior of the order parameter in finite systems @xcite .",
    "the transition is smeared out by the noise and the transition density is shifted towards smaller values . in order to have a suitable criterion for the determination of the transition density , we analysed the scaling behavior of the order parameter near the transition density @xmath25 .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows that one gets a quite reasonable data collaps using the scaling form @xmath64 @xmath65 is a scaling factor and @xmath66 is the shift of the transition density compared to the deterministic value ( [ rhocdet ] ) .",
    "the values of the transition densities are shown in fig .",
    "this results are in good agreement with the results obtained from the measurement of @xmath41 .",
    "a striking feature of second order phase transitions is the occurence of a diverging length scale at criticality and a corresponding algebraic decay of the correlation function .",
    "using lattice gas variables the density - density correlation function is defined by @xmath67 again it is very instructive to consider the deterministic case ( @xmath22 ) first . in the vicinity of the transition density one",
    "oberves a decay of the amplitude of @xmath68 for larger values of the distance between the sites . precisely at @xmath25 , however , the correlation function is given by @xmath69 because there are exactly @xmath4 empty sites in front of each car .",
    "considering small , but finite , values of @xmath9 the correlation function has the same structure as in the deterministic case , but the amplitude decays exponentially for all values of @xmath13 .",
    "the decay of the amplitude determines the correlation length for a given pair of @xmath70 , which is finite for all densities in the presence of noise .",
    "the maximal value of the correlation length @xmath71 determines the transition density for small values of @xmath9 .",
    "numerically we find @xmath72 in fact , this picture can be confirmed analytically for @xmath73 @xcite . using the results of @xcite one obtains @xmath74 for the correlation length @xmath71 at @xmath75 .",
    "therefore @xmath76 for small @xmath9 .",
    "this exponent seems to be independent of @xmath4 although the particle - hole symmetry is broken for @xmath77 .",
    "if one considers larger values of @xmath9 the correlation length gives not the relevant length scale which is then determined by the size distribution of jams . a numerical analysis of this limit is quite difficult and has to be referred to future work .",
    "our results suggest a consistent picture of the jamming transition in the nasch ca . measurements of the order parameter and the correlation function show that critical behavior only occurs in the deterministic limit where the transition density is given by @xmath78 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of any noise destroys long - range correlations .",
    "the behavior is analogous to a second order phase transition in finite systems @xcite .",
    "we have , however , checked carefully that our results are not affected by finite - size effects and are solely due to the presence of noise .",
    "analogous behavior is also found in the ising chain in a transverse field @xcite .",
    "the transverse field @xmath79 is the control parameter and corresponds to the density @xmath13 in the nasch model whereas the temperature @xmath80 corresponds to the noise parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this correspondance can be used to predict scaling laws .",
    "these predictions are currently under investigation and results will be published elsewhere .",
    "we found qualitatively the same behavior of the relaxation parameter as shown in @xcite , but some important new features have been observed .",
    "an important result is the occurance of negative values of @xmath41 which is a consequence of the relaxation mechanism beyond the transition density : within the first few time steps small jams which are present in the initial condition die out .",
    "the second phase is dominated by the formation of large jams .",
    "thus at a certain time intervall the average flow is systematically larger than the stationary value , which causes negative contributions at that time .",
    "consequently one has to question whether @xmath41 gives meaningful results concerning the relaxation time or not .",
    "the order parameter does not vanish exactly , but the transition density could be determined from the scaling behavior .",
    "this suggests that the system is not critical in a strict sense .",
    "measurements of the density - density correlation function and the correlation length confirm this picture . we find a finite correlation length in the presence of noise ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the maximum correlation length diverges in the deterministic limit like @xmath81 for all values of @xmath4 we investigated ( @xmath82 ) . for the case",
    "@xmath73 this result can also be confirmed by analytical calculations .",
    "our conclusions have to be compared with those of other investigations where signals of a second order transition also in nondeterministic cases have been found . from our point of view",
    "these results are either a consequence of a special limit considered or the methods chosen .",
    "nagel and paczuski @xcite showed the existence of self - organized critical behavior for the outflow region of a large jam in the cruise - control limit .",
    "they found a scale - invariant size distribution of jams from measurements far downstream of the megajam . in this region",
    "most of the cars propagate without any fluctuations such that this limit is also an example for scale - invariance in deterministic flow .",
    "very recently an investigation of the probabilistic version of the nasch model has been performed @xcite and it has been argued , that at the jamming transition critical behavior occurs also for the nondeterministic cases . however , the order parameter introduced in @xcite does also not vanish exactly below the transition density .",
    "all the data presented in @xcite are consistent with our interpretation of the nature of the transition .",
    "in contrast to the view of @xcite we expect true phase separation only in the limit @xmath83 .",
    "another indication for the absence of critical behavior is the well - established fact ( see e.g.  @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) that the density of maximum flow @xmath84 and the transition density @xmath25 are different",
    ". it would be rather surprising if the system exhibits a genuine second order phase transition with diverging correlation length .",
    "correlations obviously favor states with higher flow ( see e.g.  figs.[fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , which show that occupancies of cells in front of a car are surpressed which is the generalization of the particle - hole attraction observed in @xcite for @xmath73 ) . therefore one should expect that the state with the strongest correlations is also the state with the highest flow , as in the deterministic case .    in conclusion , we found the absence of criticality in the nasch model in the presence of noise . for finite @xmath9 the second order transition of the deterministic case",
    "is smeared out , similar to the situation of a second order transition in a finite system . here",
    "this effect is caused by the presence of noise , @xmath55 . for small values of @xmath9 one",
    "finds an ordering transition close to @xmath85 .",
    "larger values of the noise favour the formation of jams and a tendency to phase separation occurs ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore are currently investigating the limit @xmath86 more carefully .",
    "the results will be presented in a future publication . +",
