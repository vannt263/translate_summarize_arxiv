    "one of the central ideas of condensed matter physics is universality . despite the great variety and complexity of materials properties ,",
    "it is frequently possible to make precise quantitative predictions from a few features of a system , such as its symmetry or topological order .",
    "universality often comes hand in hand with scaling and is exhibited at a low energy scale .",
    "a textbook example is quantum critical behavior . on the other hand ,",
    "insulators do not have low - energy excitations in the bulk and thus their low - energy physics is trivial . in an ordinary insulator this would be the end of the story .",
    "topological insulators @xcite differ by the presence of topologically protected gapless edge and surface states , such as a helical fermi liquid on the surface of a 3d topological insulator or luttinger liquids on the edges of 2d @xmath1 insulators and quantum hall systems .",
    "moreover , the principle of bulk - edge correspondence establishes a deep connection between the universal aspects of edge physics and the nature of the bulk excitations @xcite .",
    "the research on edge transport in the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) has long been motivated by both the intrinsic interest of edge physics and its use as a tool to understand the properties of the bulk .",
    "in particular , most experimental methods that have been implemented or proposed to understand the puzzle @xcite of the qhe at the filling factor @xmath2 involve edge properties @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these methods include interedge tunneling @xcite-@xcite , probing upstream neutral modes @xcite-@xcite , and various interferometry schemes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the latter approach stimulated much work on interferometry at other filling factors which brought several enigmatic experimental results @xcite . in order to understand those results and interpret the experiments about topological orders in the second landau level , it is imperative to achieve a better understanding of edge physics in the qhe .",
    "one of the basic pieces of data about an edge is the velocity of charge propagation .",
    "conceptually , the most straightforward approach to its measurement is based on a time - resolved experiment : a voltage pulse is applied at the source and the edge velocity is deduced from the time it takes for the hall voltage to appear at the probe @xcite-@xcite .",
    "other methods involve the resonant transmission or absorption of microwaves @xcite and ac transport measurements at ghz frequencies in nanostructures @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "only one approach that does not rely on high frequency measurements has been implemented : the velocity is extracted from the voltage dependence of the current transmitted through a quantum hall interferometer @xcite .",
    "such an approach was successful in the integer qhe @xcite .",
    "its extension to the fractional qhe is difficult @xcite because of challenges in the experimental implementation and theoretical interpretation of interferometry in the fractional regime . in this paper",
    "we propose a different way to measure the edge velocity .",
    "our method uses dc transport through a single quantum point contact ( qpc ) .",
    "it requires a simple modification of several recent tunneling experiments @xcite-@xcite and its implementation will likely be easier than that of interferometry .    our setup is illustrated in fig .",
    "a 2d electron gas is depleted under metallic gates on the two sides of a qpc .",
    "this defines two qhe edges around the upper and lower gates . a qhe liquid exists between the edges .",
    "the width of the gates depends on the distance from the qpc and assumes two different sizes at short and long distances .",
    "a voltage bias @xmath3 is applied between the upper and lower edges .",
    "the bias drives a tunneling current @xmath4 through the qpc .",
    "this geometry can be used for a test @xcite of the theory of the @xmath2 state , proposed in ref .",
    "we focus on the weak tunneling regime .",
    "the edge velocity can be extracted from the temperature dependence of the zero - bias conductance @xmath5 .    the simplest theoretical description of edge transport , the chiral luttinger model @xcite , predicts a power law for the zero - bias conductance as a function of the temperature :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a universal exponent that depends on the topological order .",
    "the prefactor in front of the temperature is nonuniversal and depends on the transmission coefficient of the qpc .",
    "experiment does not agree with the predicted universality .",
    "for some filling factors , such as @xmath2 and @xmath8 , the observed @xmath7 agrees reasonably well with some of the theoretical proposals for the topological order @xcite . at other filling factors , such as @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the experimental results for @xmath7 are considerably higher than its universal theoretical value @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy of the experimental and theoretical @xmath7 was explained by the effect of the coulomb interaction between portions of the edge on the different sides of the gate @xcite .",
    "such an interaction is strong as long as the gate is not much wider than its distance from the 2d electron gas and the width of the edge .",
    "one may see the effect of interaction on @xmath7 as an unfortunate obstacle to probing topological orders with eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . for the measurement of the edge velocity",
    ", however , such an effect is a boon . indeed",
    ", the point contact can only feel what happens within the thermal length @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the speed of the edge mode .",
    "if the voltage bias @xmath3 is greater than the temperature then the thermal length is substituted with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the charge of the current carriers that tunnel through the qpc .",
    "thus , the observed @xmath7 is determined by the interaction across the narrow part of the gates as long as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the length of the narrow part . if @xmath17 then the observed @xmath7 is determined by the interaction across the wide part of the gates . the crossover temperature between the regimes with two different @xmath7 s depends on the edge velocity @xmath12 .",
    "to go beyond an order of magnitude estimate of the velocity one needs to compare the experimental temperature dependence of the conductance with the theory .",
    "such a theory is given below .",
    "besides the coulomb effect , the observed @xmath7 may be affected by edge reconstruction @xcite . in edge reconstruction ,",
    "pairs of contrapropagating modes emerge along the edge .",
    "this may change @xmath7 in the high - temperature regime but does not affect the tunneling exponent at low temperatures .",
    "indeed , at sufficiently large length scales , disorder localizes such mode pairs . hence , their existence becomes unimportant , if @xmath18 exceeds the localization length .",
    "this length depends on the sample details .",
    "for example , the weizmann group did not observe edge reconstruction in the integer qhe and saw edge reconstruction in the fractional qhe only at the lengths of the order of microns @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the harvard group observed a significant edge reconstruction effect @xcite at the filling factor @xmath19 at the length scale of 20 @xmath20 m . in our calculations",
    "we assume that there is no edge reconstruction at the relevant length scales .",
    "it is possible to extend our theory to an edge - reconstructed system but this goes beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "several ways exist to probe the presence or absence of edge reconstruction in a given system .",
    "this includes , for example , local thermometry , developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this paper has the following structure . in the next section",
    "we derive a general expression for the tunneling current .",
    "its limiting cases are analyzed in the appendix .",
    "we discuss how to use the tunneling current to determine the velocity in section 3 .",
    "section 4 summarizes our results .",
    "everywhere , we set @xmath21 .",
    "we consider the two geometries , illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . in both cases",
    "the interaction across the gates assumes two different values at short and long distances from the point contact .",
    "the interaction strength changes at the distance @xmath16 from the qpc . in fig . 1a , the interaction is stronger at short distances . in fig .",
    "1b the interaction is weaker at short distances . for simplicity , we assume that the interaction across the gates is absent in their wide section due to electrostatic screening .",
    "thus , we assume that the width of the wide part of the gates considerably exceeds the distance between the gates and the 2d electron gas as well as the width of the qhe edge",
    ". the latter is set by the electrostatics of the sample as discussed in ref .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize our calculations to the case of nonzero interaction everywhere",
    ".    coulomb interaction may be present between the edges on the different sides of the qpc .",
    "we will neglect that interaction .",
    "thus , we assume that the width of the gates is much less than @xmath16 .",
    "for the same reason we disregard the horizontal portions of the edges , labeled h1 , h2 , h3 and h4 in fig .",
    "1 . this justifies our assumption that the interaction abruptly changes at the distance @xmath16 from the qpc .",
    "we will limit our discussion to the simplest integer and fractional qhe states at @xmath19 and @xmath9 .",
    "its extension to other filling factors is straightforward .",
    "we introduce the coordinates on the two edges so that the tip of the contact is located at @xmath22 on both edges .",
    "@xmath23 measures the length along the edges .",
    "it increases in the charge propagation direction as shown by the arrows in fig .",

    "we assume contact interaction between the nearest points @xmath23 and @xmath33 on the opposite sides of a symmetric gate .",
    "such a choice of the interaction corresponds to an effective low - energy long - scale model .",

    "the tunneling operator also contains contributions that describe transfer of higher charges .",
    "they are less relevant at low energies and will be neglected below .",
    "we assume that the tunneling amplitude @xmath42 is small enough to justify the use of perturbation theory .",
    "as will be clear from the calculations below , this means that    @xmath43^{1-\\nu},\\ ] ]    where @xmath44 is the relevant ultraviolet cutoff energy of the order of the energy gap .",
    "our model is related to the model of a quantum wire with a weak impurity from ref .",
    "@xcite .      to describe the voltage bias , we follow the steps , outlined in refs .",
    "we assume that no tunneling between the edges was possible in the distant past , @xmath45 .",
    "then the tunneling is turned on . assuming that this happened long before @xmath46",
    ", the details of the turning on procedure do not matter for the current at @xmath46 .",
    "since in the absence of the tunneling , the charges @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the upper and lower edges conserve , the voltage bias at @xmath45 can be understood as the difference of the chemical potentials @xmath49 between the upper and lower edges which are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium at @xmath45 .",
    "the difference of the chemical potentials at @xmath45 can be set to zero in an appropriate interaction representation @xcite as discussed below .",
    "we first add to the hamiltonians of the upper and lower edges the contributions @xmath50 , @xmath28 , where @xmath51 are the total charges of the upper and lower edges .",
    "simultaneously , we set both chemical potentials to zero and introduce a time - dependence into the operators which do not commute with @xmath47 or @xmath48 . in particular , eq .

    "transmission resonances at the qpc occur at @xmath182 and result in periodic features in the @xmath0 curve .",
    "the period @xmath183 is one half of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 36 ] ) . equating the above period with the distance between the second and third maxima of the @xmath0 curve with @xmath156 in fig .",

    "the distance between the third and fourth maxima of the same curve gives 5% accuracy .",
    "our approach allows not only a measurement of the edge velocity but also the interaction @xmath132 across the gate .",
    "the interaction describes the mutual capacitance of the edge channels on the opposite sides of the gate and depends on the edge geometry .",
    "the relevant geometric information includes the width of the gates , the width of the edge channels and their distance from the gates .",
    "one can get insight into that information from knowledge of @xmath132 .",

    "for example , one can consider the geometry of fig .",
    "5a , where one of the gates has the same width at all distances from the qpc .",
    "the @xmath0 curve is described by the same eq .",

    "( [ 27 ] ) and @xmath188 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "the same expression describes the @xmath0 curve in the geometry with a straight edge instead of the lower @xmath189-shaped edge channel .",
    "we assume a constant width of the narrow part of the gates in fig .",
    "1a . in a realistic sample ,",
    "the edge width may deviate from the specifications and the width of the narrow section might depend on the distance from the tunneling contact .",
    "our results remain unaffected as long as the width fluctuations are much smaller than the average width of the narrow part of the gate",
    ". a significant coordinate dependence of the width may completely change the transport behavior .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "6 illustrates gates whose width depends linearly on the distance from the constriction .",
    "the tunneling current is determined by the typical coulomb interaction within the distance @xmath190 from the constriction .",
    "that interaction is a function of the average width of the gates within the distance @xmath18 from the qpc .",
    "since such a width depends on the temperature , the high - temperature asymptotic of the conductance is not given by a power law .",
    "we treat tunneling at the qpc in figs .",
    "1a and 1b as if it occurred at a single point .",
    "the validity of such an assumption crucially depends on the total width of the gates being less than @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "if the width of the gates exceeds @xmath191 in the geometry of fig .",
    "1b then the tunneling current is determined solely by the two horizontal portions of the edge immediately above and below the dashed line in fig .",
    "1b . the system forms an interferometer and the current may oscillate as a function of the voltage bias . in all our calculations",
    "we assume that we are away from such a regime .",
    "the discussion at the end of the previous section reveals a connection of the proposed experiment with coulomb blockade @xcite-@xcite,@xcite .",
    "indeed , one can use the geometry of fig .",
    "5b to extract the edge velocities from the locations of the resonant transmission peaks .",
    "in contrast to fig .",
    "5a , there are three qhe edges with two tunneling contacts between them .",
    "each of the edges is defined by a separate gate which can be maintained at a different gate voltage .",
    "thus , one can trace the dependence of the zero - bias conductance on the gate voltage @xmath193 at gate 2 in fig .",
    "5b . the energy of edge 2 depends on its charge @xmath194 :    @xmath195    where @xmath12 is the speed of the edge mode . at low temperatures",
    "the edge is in its ground state with @xmath196 $ ] .",
    "transmission peaks occur when @xmath197 and @xmath198 are degenerate , i.e. , at @xmath199 .",
    "this allows finding @xmath12 .",
    "the geometry of fig .",
    "5b is related to that of fig .",
    "5a though more complicated because of an additional quantum point contact qpc2",
    ". one could fabricate a tunable structure that can be continuously changed from the geometry of fig .",
    "5b into that of fig .",
    "5a by changing the voltages at the gates which define qpc2",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the results for the edge velocity in different regimes in such a structure .",
    "note that the edge structure and hence the velocity @xmath12 depend on the gate voltage @xmath193 which changes in the coulomb blockade experiment .",
    "all gate voltages are fixed in the experiment with a single qpc .    in conclusion ,",
    "we propose a method to find the edge mode velocity in the qhe from dc transport through a single qpc .",
