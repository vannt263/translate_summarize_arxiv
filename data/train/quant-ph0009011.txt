    "the model of a particle bouncing off a circular constraint on a polygonal path was originally devised by newton to motivate the concept of centripetal force@xcite associated with circular motion of the particle .",
    "it serves the precise purpose of highlighting the notion of a force continuously operating on the particle on a circle as the limiting case of motion on an inscribed polygon with the corners acting as force centers .",
    "however , the intuitive simplicity of the circle case has contributed to the consistent ignoring of newton s original model .",
    "recently the problem has received some attention @xcite mostly from the historical perspective .",
    "no quantum mechanical treatment of the problem is available in the literature .",
    "the quantum mechanics of the polygon model will be of much pedagogical value for introductory courses in quantum theory inasmuch as it is an illustration of the fact that the symmetry ( the n - fold discrete rotational symmetry in the present case ) of a problem is fully reflected in the wavefunction .    in this work",
    "we first reduce the lagrangian for the system by using the constraint equation and then use a suitable generalized coordinate to bring the hamiltonian to the free particle form . the resulting eigenvalues are shown to reduce to those of a particle on a circle in the limit as the number of sides @xmath0 and to those of a particle in an infinite potential well in the @xmath1 case .",
    "we begin by constructing the full lagrangian for a particle of unit mass constrained to move on an @xmath2-sided regular polygon .",
    "the @xmath2-gon can be parametrized by    @xmath3    where @xmath4 labels the sides of the polygon . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath5 is the length of the normal from the center of the circumcircle ( of radius @xmath6 ) to the side .",
    "the length of a side is then given by @xmath7 .    the lagrangian will be given by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is a lagrange multiplier implementing the constraint    @xmath10    to reduce the lagrangian to the only relevant degree of freedom i.e. , @xmath11 , we employ the constraint directly to bring it to the form    @xmath12    the momentum conjugate to the coordinate @xmath11 is    @xmath13    finally , the classical reduced hamiltonian is given by    @xmath14",
    "a closer look at the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ clhamilt ] reveals that if we introduce a new generalized coordinate    @xmath15    it reduces to the simple free particle form    @xmath16    following the usual schrdinger prescription for quantization , the quantum canonical momentum is @xmath17 .",
    "the hamiltonian is therefore the usual free particle schrodinger operator    @xmath18    a more formal approach to the quantization of such a hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ clhamilt ] would be to construct the laplace - beltrami operator in terms of the properly constructed quantum momentum operator @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the same quantum hamiltonian is obtained by this procedure also .",
    "the free particle solutions are now given by the plane waves    @xmath19    reverting back to the @xmath11 variable we have    @xmath20    for the wavefunction in the @xmath21 side . the normalization is obtained from    @xmath22    whence @xmath23 .",
    "the boundary condition following from the singlevaluedness of the wavefunction    @xmath24    leads to the quantization condition    @xmath25    the energy eigenvalues are now given by    @xmath26    we note that the above quantization conditions are also obtained by considering symmetric and antisymmetric solutions about the midpoint of a side , @xmath27 namely ,    @xmath28    and    @xmath29    and imposing the periodic boundary conditions    @xmath30    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the solutions for a hexagon ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the familiar example of a particle moving on a circle@xcite would correspond to the limit @xmath0 for the polygon model . in this limit , as each side of the polygon reduces to just a point , it is necessary to redefine the conjugate variables as @xmath32 for the angle variable and @xmath33 for the angular momentum in units of @xmath34 .",
    "we see that the eigenvalues now become @xmath35 and the eigenfunctions reduce to the well known solutions @xmath36 for a free particle on a circle .",
    "in the interesting case of @xmath1 , classically the polygon reduces to just a segment of length @xmath37 traversed in both directions as discussed very lucidly by anicin @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanically this is equivalent to a particle confined in an infinite potential well of width @xmath37 . indeed , the eigenvalue equation eq .",
    "[ energy ] reduces to the familiar eigenvalues    @xmath38    note that in the above we have effected the replacement of wavevector @xmath39 by @xmath40 to take care of the two - fold reflection symmetry which is inherent in the reduction of the polygon to the segment of length @xmath37 .",
    "we remark that since the parameterization eq .",
    "[ rcoord ] of the polygon does not survive down to the @xmath1 case for obvious reasons , the eigenfunctions can not be expressed in terms of the variable @xmath41 or @xmath11 . the eigenvalue equation eq .",
    "[ energy ] , nevertheless , is robust and gives the true eigenvalues .",
    "we have quantized newton s polygon model and derived the general eigenvalues and eigenfunctions .",
    "we have recovered the quantum mechanics in the circle limit of the polygon . moreover ,",
    "the energy eigenvalues for the @xmath1 case have been identified with those of a particle in an infinite potential well . in the light of the above results it would be interesting exercise for students of introductory courses on quantum mechanics to look into the polygon analogues of the well studied problems of stark effect for rotor@xcite , aharonov - bohm effect for a particle on a circle etc ..    we gratefully acknowledge fruitful discussions with v. v. shenoi , and j. kamila .",
