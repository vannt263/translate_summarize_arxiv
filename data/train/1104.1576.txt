    "the quantum mechanics of spatially constant @xmath0 yang - mills fields minimally coupled to dirac fields has been investigated as the strong coupling limit of 2-color qcd . using the polar decomposition for the spatial components of the original constrained gauge fields and a corresponding @xmath0 phase rotation of the constrained quark fields as in @xcite , the corresponding unconstrained hamiltonian ( [ unconstrainedh ] ) and total spin operator ( [ unconstrainedj ] ) has been derived in the present work . the classical analog ( in some equivalent form ) of ( [ unconstrainedh ] )",
    "has already been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the expression for the total spin ( [ unconstrainedj ] ) , in particular its quark part @xmath64 , is new in the present work and has important consequences .",
    "firstly , such as the unconstrained gluon fields can be represented by spin-0 and spin-2 fields , the unconstrained quark fields are found to carry spin-0 and spin-1 , but to continue to satisfy anti - commutation relations and hence the pauli - exclusion principle .",
    "the states of @xmath0 dirac - yang - mills quantum mechanics can therefore only have integer spin .",
    "secondly , the expression ( [ s4 ] ) for @xmath64 in terms of @xmath218 allows to determine the correct transformation properties of the unconstrained quark fields leading to the decomposition ( [ patransfferm])-([u_0 ] ) .",
    "together with the well - known principle - axes representation ( [ patransf ] ) of the unconstrained gluon field @xmath57 it leads to a transparent form ( [ hphys])-([hphysm ] ) of the unconstrained @xmath0-dirac - yang - mills hamiltonian , which separates the rotational from the scalar degrees of freedom and is new to the best of my knowledge .",
    "it generalizes the corresponding form of the pure - gluon hamiltonian , known already for several decades , and allows to derive the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian of @xmath0 dirac - yang - mills quantum mechanics . in order to keep the formulas simple ,",
    "only the 1-flavor case has been shown in this work , the generalization of the hamiltonian ( [ hphys])-([hphysm ] ) to two or three flavors is trivial .    as an illustrative example",
    ", the energy spectrum has been obtained here for the case of total spin-0 and for 4 massless quarks of one flavor ( half - filling ) , imposing the boundary condition ( [ fermbc ] ) of c - symmetry on the quark wave function . for the case of 2 left- and 2 right - handed quarks ,",

    "its lowest state could be identified with the sigma - antisigma excitation in our investigation .",
    "the energy spectrum of the third case of 4 left- or 4 right - handed quarks , finally , is the sum - set of the positive - and negative - parity pure - gluon spectra",
    ". a non - vanishing quark - mass term will cause transitions between these three massless spectra .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that the boundary condition ( [ fermbc ] ) of c - symmetry is the only one that leads to energies lower than the pure - gluon ground state energy .",
    "finally , let us remark that , since the fields and states of @xmath0 dirac - yang - mills quantum mechanics all carry integer spin , the expansion of the physical hamiltonian in the number of spatial derivatives and coarse graining , developed in @xcite for the case of @xmath0 yang - mills theory , can be straightforwardly generalized to the case of 2-color - qcd .",
    "one should note that the reduced quarks are not valence quarks , and that baryon number is expected to be related to topological quantum numbers of field configurations extending over several granulas .",
    "we conjecture here , that for the real case of qcd with three colors , the situation will be analogous to the 2-color case , except that baryons now carry half - integer spin and will appear naturally as skyrmions @xcite .",
