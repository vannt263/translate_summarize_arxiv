    "helium adsorbed on basal plane graphite has been a fruitful research field for physics of two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum system .",
    "grafoil is the most commonly - used exfoliated graphite in this type of experiments because of its large specific surface area as much as @xmath4  m@xmath5 g .",
    "however , the characteristic length of step - free atomically flat surfaces ( platelets ) is only about @xmath6  nm .",
    "this causes the size effects in phase transitions of 2d he system and large amounts of heterogeneous adsorption sites .",
    "zyx is an exfoliated graphite with much larger platelet size of @xmath7  nm than grafoil  @xcite .",
    "previous experiments with the zyx substrate show much sharper anomalies in heat - capacity and sub - steps in vapor - pressure isotherms at the @xmath1 phase formation in the 1st layer of @xmath8he  @xcite and n@xmath9  @xcite than those with grafoil , respectively . in this phase ,",
    "adsorbed atoms occupy the center of every one of three adjacent hexagons of carbon honeycomb lattice .",
    "however , there have been few experiments so far with zyx because of its much smaller surface area ( @xmath10  m@xmath11 g ) by a factor of ten than grafoil .    in this report",
    ", we show preliminary results of new heat - capacity and vapor - pressure measurements of @xmath0he with zyx .",
    "we measured heat capacities of the 1st layer near the density of the @xmath12 phase ( @xmath13  nm@xmath3 ) and at densities around the 2nd layer promotion where vapor pressure measurements were also carried out .",
    "details of the experimental setup including the preparation of the zyx substrate are described in our previous papers  @xcite .",
    "briefly , the sample cell is made of nylon and contains @xmath14  g of zyx with a surface area of about 30  m@xmath15 .",
    "a more detailed description of the determination of surface area is given in the next section .",
    "heat capacity is measured using the quasi - adiabatic heat - pulse method with a cernox cx-1050 thermometer .",
    "since the calorimeter is originally designed for measurements at temperatures below @xmath10  k , it is not thermally isolated sufficiently beyond that temperature .",
    "therefore , in this work , we applied constant heat currents to the zyx substrate in order to avoid too rapid cooling of the temperature of the calorimeter which is sometimes much higher than that of the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator .",
    "the poor thermal isolation limits the maximum waiting time after a heat pulse to a few hundred seconds long which can be shorter than the thermal relaxation time of the system .",
    "we found that , by multiplying our data at @xmath16 by a @xmath17-linear correction factor @xmath18 from 1.18 to 1.47 in the temperature range of 2.6 @xmath19 3.2 k , we obtain a very good agreement with those by bretz  @xcite within scatterings ( 5% ) of the two data sets . in principle , @xmath18 should depend only on temperature and such an assumed @xmath17-linear dependence of @xmath18 gives @xmath20 at @xmath21  k where we know the correction is unnecessary because of much better thermal isolation .",
    "therefore we applied this correction to our all @xmath22 data at the temperatures .",
    "the addendum heat capacity in this temperature range is rather large being about 40% of @xmath23 .",
    "vapor pressure was measured by a capacitive - pressure - gauge with a 0.2-mm - thick hard - silver diaphragm located on the mixing chamber plate .",
    "the sensitivity is @xmath24  mbar .",
    "figure  [ root3qfs ] shows measured heat capacities of the 1st layer at densities in the vicinity of @xmath25 .",
    "the anomaly is much sharper , with a two - times larger peak - height , than that obtained in the previous experiment @xcite with grafoil shown as a thick line in the figure .",
    "the melting transition of the @xmath12 phase is explained by the three - state potts model  @xcite which gives a symmetrical specific heat about @xmath26 with a critical exponent @xmath27 of @xmath28 .",
    "these behaviors are clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ 1by3loglog ] where our data give @xmath29 . here , a constant background heat capacity @xmath30  mj / k is subtracted .",
    "this @xmath27 value is consistent with the theoretical expectation and agrees with @xmath31 obtained in the previous experiment with zyx  @xcite .",
    "the data deviate systematically from the fitting at @xmath32 , which is not seen in the previous measurement where a temperature - dependent @xmath33 is subtracted  @xcite .",
    "the model also requires an entropy change of @xmath34 per particle associated with the phase transition .",
    "our corrected data are consistent with this expectation .",
    "the maximum peak height is expected to appear at @xmath35 , which allows us to determine the surface area of zyx to be @xmath36  m@xmath37 assuming that the perfect @xmath1 structure is formed there . using this value and the @xmath0he gas amount introduced into the calorimeter",
    ", we can calculate the areal density @xmath38 .",
    "the surface area determined in this way is in good agreement with the value ( @xmath39  m@xmath37 ) obtained in the adsorption isotherm measurement  @xcite . the significantly asymmetric density dependence of @xmath23 is shown in fig .",
    "[ c1by3 ] comparing with the result of grafoil  @xcite .",
    "@xmath23 with zyx decreases precipitously by half within @xmath40  nm@xmath3 above @xmath25 though it decreases only @xmath41 over @xmath42  nm@xmath3 below @xmath25 .",
    "it means that the excess atoms easily break the commensurate symmetry unlike holes ( particle - hole asymmetry ) .",
    "the data with grafoil show a much broader and more symmetric maximum around @xmath25 over @xmath43  nm@xmath3 , which is presumably due to a much larger amount of surface heterogeneities in this substrate",
    ". the usage of the higher quality substrate in this experiment will provide further information on the so - called _ commensurate - incommensurate _ or _ domain - wall _ density region ( @xmath44 ) in the near future .",
    "the experimental determination of the 2nd - layer promotion density @xmath45 is important because it is a calibration point in determining density scale for experimentalists who use exfoliated graphite substrates which necessarily contain finite amounts of surface irregularities and in testing accuracies of calculation for theorists who use different computational methods or assumptions .",
    "we made heat capacity measurements of @xmath0he on zyx at densities of @xmath46  nm@xmath3 in the temperature range of @xmath47  k where the total heat - capacity is expectedly dominated by a contribution from the dulong - petit type @xmath17-independent and density - linear heat capacity of the 2nd - layer gas .",
    "we estimated here a heat capacity contribution from the 1st - layer solid as a debye heat - capacity with @xmath48  k , which is derived from the known @xmath38-dependency of the first layer density  @xcite and the grneisen parameter for @xmath49  @xcite , and subtracted it from the total heat capacity .",
    "as expected , the measured heat - capacity isotherms at five different temperatures ( @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54  k ) follow straight lines very well , which gives @xmath55  nm@xmath3 as shown in fig .",
    "[ iso ] ( only two of them are plotted here ) . a similar @xmath45 value ( @xmath56  nm@xmath3 ) is reported previously  @xcite based on the same analysis , where the density grid is not fine enough and grafoil substrate is used .",
    "our value is slightly higher than @xmath57  nm@xmath3 determined from a neutron scattering experiment  @xcite .    besides heat capacity measurements",
    ", we also measured vapor pressure @xmath58 of samples at selected densities around @xmath45 as a function of temperature as shown in fig .",
    "[ demo2 ] . from these data",
    ", we can deduce isosteric heat @xmath59 for each density using the following equation : @xmath60    the result is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath61 seems to have a kink at a density slightly lower than 12  nm@xmath3 , above which it is almost density - independent at @xmath62 3 k. apparently , the kink corresponds to @xmath45 . by taking more data at densities in between 11 and 12  nm@xmath3 using a pressure gauge with a much higher sensitivity than the present one",
    ", we should be able to locate @xmath45 more precisely from pressure measurement in the near future .",
    "figure  [ qst ] also shows data taken at much higher temperatures with grafoil by previous workers  @xcite .",
    "the weak density dependence even for the zero - temperature behavior estimated from their data would indicate the larger amount of surface heterogeneities in their substrate .",
    "the vapor pressure measurement also gives a different insight into the adsorbed film system .",
    "chemical potential @xmath63 of @xmath0he gas in the sample cell should be equal to that of the 2d @xmath0he film in thermal equilibrium with the gas .",
    "@xmath63 can be estimated from @xmath58 as @xmath64\\ ] ] on the assumption of ideal gas .",
    "the resultant @xmath63 values at several fixed temperatures are plotted in fig .",
    "the data show again a kink structure at @xmath45 at lower temperatures .",
    "the overall behavior is similar to that with grafoil by previous workers  @xcite .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath65 of the 2nd layer ( @xmath6612  nm@xmath3 ) is nearly density independent at @xmath67  k. in addition , this value is in good agreement with existing theoretical calculations by corboz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite denoted by a horizontal dotted line and by whitlock _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite denoted by a horizontal dashed line in the figure . on the other hand , the chemical potential @xmath68 of the 1st layer ( @xmath6912  nm@xmath3 ) seems to be consistently lower than the same theoretical calculations .",
    "however , this may simply be a finite temperature effect .",
    "it is desirable to extend the present pressure measurements down to much lower temperatures using a higher sensitivity pressure gauge .",
    "by using the zyx substrate , which is an exfoliated graphite with better crystallinity than grafoil , we obtained preliminary heat - capacity data for the first and second adsorbed layers of @xmath0he .",
    "because of the poor thermal isolation of our calorimeter from the surroundings in the temperature range of 2.6 @xmath19 3.2 k , we had to apply relatively large corrections ( @xmath70 ) to the measured heat capacities .",
    "nevertheless , we could observe two characteristic features which demonstrate the better surface quality of our substrate .",
    "first , the heat - capacity anomaly associated with the @xmath1 phase formation in the 1st layer is much sharper than that with grafoil .",
    "second , we found a significantly asymmetric density - dependence of the heat - capacity peak of this phase , which is the first observation providing a new insight into the commensurate - incommensurate transition .",
    "the 2nd - layer promotion density is determined as @xmath71  nm@xmath3 by extrapolating the linear density - dependences of the heat capacity isotherms of the 2nd layer .",
    "this value is consistent with our own vapor pressure measurement and with the existing theoretical calculations .",
