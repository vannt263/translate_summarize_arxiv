    "group theoretical methods are prevalent in the physics of the 20th century .",
    "they have found their applications in the field of quantum optics as well .",
    "one of the typical application is related with nonclassical states of light  @xcite .",
    "another application is involved in the description linear and nonlinear optical multiports  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider linear optical devices , such as beam splitters and tritters ( i.e. optical six - ports ) .",
    "these are basic devices of interferometry , and building blocks of several schemes that have attracted much attention recently , such as polarization teleportation  @xcite , quantum lithography  @xcite , or quantum computation with linear optics  @xcite . in such applications ,",
    "states with a low number of photons interfere on these devices .",
    "the operation of a lossless beam splitter from quantum mechanical point of view was investigated by several authors .",
    "a thorough summary of this topic was given by campos , saleh and teich  @xcite , who emphasize the group theoretical aspects of the description , which are originating from the conservation of photon number .",
    "the description relies on the schwinger - representation of @xmath1 lie - algebra , i.e. angular momenta . in section  [",
    "sect : splitters ] we give a brief summary of these methods . in section  [",
    "sect : scissors ] we show an application , namely the generalized `` quantum scissors '' device  @xcite , which is also teleporter for photon - number state superpositions .",
    "we demonstrate how the @xmath1 algebra and the properties of the beam splitter transformation can help us in understanding the operation of a device of photon interference .",
    "tritters , i.e. three - input three - output passive linear optical elements also have found several applications , such as in quantum homodyning  @xcite , entanglement realization  @xcite , bell - experiments  @xcite , and optical realization of certain nonunitary transformations  @xcite .",
    "the analogous treatment to that of beam - splitters , i.e. application of @xmath0 symmetry in the description of such devices has not yet been emphasized . in section  [",
    "sect : tritters ] we outline the appropriate formalism . in section  [ sect : concl ] we summarize the conclusions .",
    "a beam splitter , or linear coupler is a device having two input and two output ports , each of which are single modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the annihilation operators of the input ports , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 those of the outputs respectively . in a passive lossless linear beam splitter ( or in a linear coupler )",
    "these are connected via @xmath6 thus the @xmath7 matrix @xmath8 is a matrix corresponding to the fundamental representation of @xmath9 .",
    "the details of theory of lossless passive beam splitters can be found in ref .",
    "our task is now to emphasize the strictly group - theoretical aspects of the theory .",
    "both the input and the output pair of modes can be regarded as two - dimensional oscillators , possessing @xmath9 symmetry . according to schwinger representation of angular momenta@xcite , the generators @xmath10 of the @xmath1 lie - algebra can be constructed as @xmath11 where the @xmath12-s are the pauli - matrices .",
    "the output operators @xmath13 realize the @xmath1 lie - algebra in the same way , these generators will be denoted by @xmath14 the consequence of this is , that the two - mode number states @xmath15 , @xmath16 can be divided into @xmath9-multiplets .",
    "we consider input states , the method is the same for the output states .    one may construct the operator @xmath17 from which the operator of the `` square of angular momentum '' , the is the casimir - operator of the algebra , can be constructed as @xmath18 the multiplets can be indexed by the eigenvalue of the casimir - operator . in the theory of the angular momenta , it is usual to use the eigenvalue of @xmath19 instead , as it is in a one - to - one correspondence with the eigenvalue of @xmath20 . in our case ,",
    "multiplet of index @xmath21 is the set of the number states with @xmath22 .",
    "the states in a multiplet are indexed by the eigenvalues @xmath23 of @xmath24 .",
    "thus instead of the photon number , states can be indexed as @xmath25 the ladder operators @xmath26 , @xmath27 defined in the standard way can be applied to increase and decrease the index @xmath28 .",
    "the same relabelling of states can be defined for the number states at the output .",
    "the beam splitter itself is also an @xmath9 device according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsdef ] ) .",
    "there are two important consequences of this fact .",
    "one of these is , that the lie - algebras at the input and at the output are related as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the element of @xmath31 , rotations of the three - dimensional real vector - space , corresponding to @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsdef ] ) .",
    "this provides us with the opportunity of visualizing the action of the device as a rotation of a vector in the three - dimensional space .",
    "the detailed analysis can be found in ref .",
    "the other important consequence is , that the multiplets of the states are invariant subspaces of the beam splitter transformation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bsdef ] ) , namely , @xmath21 is conserved by the transformation .",
    "thus the notation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : su2ind ] ) is very suitable in the description of the beam splitter transformation .",
    "we have seen , that there are three direct consequences of the @xmath9 symmetry : relabeling of states , conservation of @xmath21 , and the connection with @xmath31 . in the next section we present a simple application of few - photon interference , where the multiplet way of thinking proves to be useful .",
    "the quantum scissors device@xcite is a tool for quantum state design of running wave states , exploiting quantum nonlocality . under certain conditions",
    ", it can be regarded as a teleporter for photon number states .",
    "we examine some aspects of the latter case in detail .",
    "consider the scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig : scissors ] .",
    "the aim is the conditional teleportation of the state @xmath32 in mode 1 , which is at alice , to bob at mode 3 .",
    "alice and bob share an entangled state @xmath33 in modes @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( we have applied @xmath9 notation in the indices of @xmath36 coefficients ) .",
    "modes @xmath37 and @xmath34 interfere on the beam splitter bs .",
    "the output ports of the beam splitter are incident on detectors , which are supposed to be ideal photon counters realizing projective quantum measurement on the number state basis .",
    "the teleportation is successful , if the detectors count one single photon each , in coincidence .",
    "the measurement can be described as follows .",
    "the detection of the photons is the annihilation of two photons to vacuum , described by the operator @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the teleported state , we write the state of all three modes @xmath39 after the action on the beam splitter into the form @xmath40 where the operator @xmath41 is a polynomial of the creation operators , and generates @xmath42 from the vacuum .",
    "the projection by the measurement drops all the summands in the expression of @xmath43 , except for that containing @xmath44 , thus the resulting ( teleported ) state can be read out from the expression of @xmath45 . as @xmath4 and @xmath5 originate from a beam splitter transformation , it is worth collecting them into @xmath46 multiplets .",
    "let us introduce the notation @xmath47 for the outcome operators .",
    "these are groups of creation operators indexed by the @xmath9 indices .",
    "furthermore , given a set of arbitrary coefficients @xmath48 , let there be @xmath49 a linear combination of outcome operators in the @xmath21-th multiplet , with coefficients @xmath50 .",
    "different calligraphic letters in the index shall mean a different set of parameters in this notation .",
    "notice , that maximum of @xmath51 photons can be present at the beam splitter .",
    "the coefficients @xmath52 from eq .  (",
    "[ eq : scissin ] ) should appear in @xmath53 before @xmath54 on powers determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : scissin ] ) , due to the linearity of the system .",
    "thus in general we have @xmath55 the coefficients @xmath36 of the entangled state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epr ] ) , and the parameters of the unitary operator @xmath8 describing the beam splitter bs are included in the coefficients denoted by calligraphic letters .",
    "it can be noticed that the multiplet structure suggested by the nature of the beam splitter transformation is reflected in the structure of the operator creating the output state .",
    "only the outcomes in the @xmath56 multiplets appear with all three @xmath57 coefficients of the input state .",
    "only the outcomes in these multiplets can provide teleportation , since the state obtained after the measurement on mode @xmath58 depends on all three a coefficients . in the case of a measurement outcome corresponding to an other multiplet",
    "some of the information is lost .",
    "the whole information is transferred if the total number of detected photons is 2 .",
    "the @xmath50 ,  @xmath59 , and  @xmath60 coefficients depend on the beam splitter parameters and the @xmath36 parameters of the entangled state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epr ] ) .",
    "it is possible to set these parameters so that @xmath61 .",
    "the actual determination of the appropriate entangled state and beam splitter is a geometrical problem discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of measurement outcome described by @xmath62 , i.e.  detection one photon on both detectors in coincidence , causes the output in mode @xmath37 to become the same as the input state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scissin ] ) was .",
    "this is the case of successful teleportation , which happens in the @xmath63 of the cases , regardless of the input state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scissin ] ) .    in this section",
    "we have shown on an example , that the application of multiplet concept in the description of photon number conservation can be indeed useful in understanding operation of few - photon interference devices .",
    "the question naturally arises , whether one can treat a passive linear optical six - port or tritter in a similar manner to beam - splitters .",
    "such devices can be realized either as a set of three coupled waveguides or as a combination of beam - splitters and phase - shifters@xcite .",
    "there are now three input and three output modes , thus both the input and output can be regarded as a three - dimensional oscillator .",
    "three - dimensional oscillators are well known to possess @xmath0 symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the tritter can be described , similarly to the beam - splitter ( [ eq : bsdef ] ) , by a unitary operator which is now element of @xmath0 : @xmath64 where @xmath65-s and @xmath13-s are the annihilation operators for the input and output modes respectively .",
    "thus we can follow the similar way , as in the case of beam splitters : first we describe the bosonic realization of @xmath66 algebra and the structure of multiplets , then we introduce some details of the tritter - transformation .",
    "the lowest dimensional faithful representation of @xmath66 algebra consists of eight @xmath67 matrices @xmath68 , where @xmath69-s are the gell - mann matrices , explicitly : @xmath70 the bosonic realization is given in a similar form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : su2_gen ] ) in the @xmath1 case , namely for the input operators : @xmath71 whereas the realization @xmath72 for the output field is defined in the same way with the operators @xmath73 .",
    "let us describe the multiplet structure at the input port .",
    "in order to do so , we introduce some operators usually applied in this context : @xmath74 the eigenvalues of the two commuting operators @xmath75 and @xmath76 are applied for labelling of the multiplets ( such as the third component of angular momentum in the @xmath9 case ) .",
    "the others appear to be `` ladder - operators '' , which allow `` movements '' in the multiplets . before going into details , let us give the explicit form of all the operators in for the input field : the generators are @xmath77 and the other operators :    @xmath78",
    "let us now examine the structure of the multiplets .",
    "there are two casimir operators of @xmath0 , but they have a rather difficult structure , thus it is conventional to use some other indexing of the multiplets .    in order to index states corresponding to the same multiplet , the eigenvalues of the @xmath79 and @xmath80 operator appear to be suitable , which are linear combinations of the number operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 , and they commute with them . thus the eigenstates of these number - operators , the @xmath83 fock - states , are the eigenstates of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , with the eigenvalues . @xmath84",
    "thus the multiplets can be visualized in the @xmath75@xmath76 plane .",
    "if one of the elements of a given multiplet is known , the others can be constructed using the @xmath85 ladder - operators .",
    "the action of these operators is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oper ] .",
    "it can be seen , that the @xmath66 algebra contains three @xmath1 subalgebras symmetrically .",
    "generally , su(3 ) multiplets are hexagon ( truncated triangle ) shaped ( for a simple explanation see e. g. in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . due to the difficult structure of casimir operators ( not detailed here ) , usually",
    "the dimensions of these polygons are used for indexing the states .",
    "the multiplet denoted by @xmath86 has @xmath87 _ due to the additional symmetry of interchanging of bosons however , only the multiplets @xmath88 can be realized , where @xmath89 denotes the total number of the photons_. some of the multiplets are visualized on the @xmath75 ",
    "@xmath76 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : multip ] .",
    "having described the multiplets , now let us turn our attention to the description of the tritters alike that of beam splitters in ref .",
    "the matrix @xmath8 describing the tritter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tritterdef ] ) can be decomposed into a generalized `` euler - angle '' parameterization defined in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath90 this expression enables us to connect a standard parameterization of @xmath0 with the physical parameters of the actual realization of the tritter , such as transmittivity and reflectivity coefficients of the optical elements involved .    similarly to the case of beam splitters ,",
    "the action of a tritter may be described as follows : the input of the tritter can be described by the operators @xmath91 , which form a @xmath66-algebra . from these operators , all the others described in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : boson_opers ] ) can be expressed and used . the beam - splitter transformation @xmath8 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tritterdef ] ) turns these operators to operators @xmath92 describing the output modes .",
    "the @xmath93-s are formed from the @xmath94 operators .",
    "the transformation @xmath8 is represented by the _ adjoint representation _ of @xmath0 , which is a 8-parameter subgroup of the group @xmath95 of 8-dimensional rotations : @xmath96 the explicit form of the @xmath97 matrices is given in refs .",
    "in this paper we have revisited @xmath9-description of beam splitters .",
    "we have presented an example of an optical setup in which only a few photon interfere , and have shown how the multiplet picture can help in understanding of the operation of such schemes .",
    "we have outlined the @xmath0 description of optical tritters , describing bosonic realization of @xmath0 and showing the structure of the multiplets .",
    "the formalism suggested here maybe useful in applications of tritters , e.g. in few - photon interference experiments .",
    "the situation in case of tritters is similar to the case of the beam splitters , where 3 dimensional rotations occur , but unfortunately 8 dimensional rotations can not be visualized .",
