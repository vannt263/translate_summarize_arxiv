    "financial bubbles and crashes have been occurring occasionally in nearly every market causing social troubles of various magnitudes . in the ordinary market state , prices fluctuate fairly randomly and directional prediction is almost impossible ; however , during bubbles and crashes , the market prices are known to move quite asymmetrically @xcite . viewing",
    "the movement of prices in a coarse - grained way reveals that the growth of price in a bubble period is approximated either by an exponential function @xcite , a double exponential function @xcite , or a function having a finite - time singularity @xcite . in any case",
    ", it is a reasonable assumption that there are some special mechanisms of bubbles that are quite different from the ordinary market state .",
    "it is very important to develop the teqnique to quantify the financial risk of large price changes@xcite .    in the year 1900",
    ", bachelier introduced the first random walk model as a model of market price fluctuations@xcite .",
    "the stochastic model based on his mathematical theory was developed in the field of financial technology and it is widely accepted in the real financial market .    in the 1990s , analysis of high frequency tick - by - tick data by physicist clarified that market price is not a simple random walk@xcite .",
    "the market price has some empirically stylized facts which clearly deviate from a pure random walk . in order to build a model which fullfills those properties ,",
    "many variants of random walk models of market prices have been proposed .",
    "recently , one of the authors ( _ m.t . _ ) and her group introduced a new type of market model called potentials of unbalanced complex kinetics ( puck ) , wherein the market price is described by a random walker in a temporally deforming potential force whose center is given by the trace of the walker @xcite .",
    "this model has quite different statistical properties from the case of the fixed potential function and its center , i.e. , the ulenbeck - ornstein process@xcite .",
    "moreover , the continuum limit of puck model is equivalent to the langevin equation with time - dependent coefficients@xcite .    from the viewpoint of this model with a quadric potential function ,",
    "market states are categorized into five conditions , characterized by the potential function : ( 1 ) a pure random walk state , which is given by the case of no potential force . in mathematical finance , this condition is assumed to the generic property of the price fluctuation of a financial market ; ( 2 ) a stable state , which is described by attractive potential force .",
    "peinke and his group show existence of similar kind of attractive potential in foreign exchange market@xcite .",
    "ausloos and his group applied the same method and obtained similar results for the stock index data@xcite ; ( 3 ) an unstable state which is described by a repulsive potential force ; ( 4 ) a non - stationary state , which is characterized by a strong attractive force causing the exponential oscillation of price@xcite ; and ( 5 ) a non - stationary state , which is characterized by a strong repulsive force causing nearly monotonic price changes as a result .",
    "data analysis based on puck has clarified that the market states are changing in various timescales .",
    "the puck model is known to satisfy basic market statistics such as the power - law distribution of price changes@xcite , rapid decay of the autocorrelation of price changes , long correlation of the square of price changes@xcite , and abnormal diffusion properties@xcite in a short timescale @xcite .",
    "it has been clarified that the market potential force is closely related to the mass behavior of dealers , especially , the trend - following behavior @xcite .",
    "morever , the nobel prize laureled market model - the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ( arch ) model - is derived in a very special limit case , where a nonlinear potential force appears with randomly chosen signs at each time step @xcite .    in this paper , we reformulate the data analysis method of puck taking into account the higher - order potential functions , and we focus our attention on finding precursors of bubbles and crashes .",
    "the data we analyze here as an example is the tick - by - tick data of yen - dollar exchange rates , which showed the largest rate change in 1998 .",
    "the puck model is represented by the following set of equations .",
    "@xmath0 here , @xmath1 is the noise - reduced market price at the t - th tick obtained by applying the optimal moving average @xcite , @xmath2 is the random noise typically a gaussian white noise , @xmath3 is the potential function which is approximated by the following taylor expansion form with time - dependent coefficients @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath6 is the average of the past price changes with size m ticks , and it is assumed that this point gives the center of the potential function that moves with the random walker s footprint ( fig .",

    "the market fluctuations of fig .",
    "[ example]a and fig .",
    "[ example]d look very different intuitively ; however , the square of the market price fluctuations in unit time , called the volatility , takes about the same value in both cases . by applying the puck model we can clearly observe the difference in the quadric term of the potential function as shown in fig .",

    "it is found that these quadric potential functions can generally be found in ordinary states of financial markets ; however , in particular periods , when prices move rather monotonically we can observe a new type of nonquadric potential functions such as a cubic or a quartic function , as shown later .    in order to describe such nonlinear potential functions correctly",
    ", we introduce a higher - order term in the potential model as follows .",
    "@xmath18 this higher - order potential model can reproduce all kinds of typical price motions in bubbles , crashes and hyper - inflations as mentioned in the introduction of this paper@xcite",
    ".    when the market potential function is described by a cubic function with a local minimum point , there are obviously two states for the random walker as shown schematically in fig .",

    "the first state is the trapped state that is practically the same as the case of a random walk in a stable quadric potential function , however , with a finite possibility the walker goes over the potential barrier .",
    "the second state is the nontrapped state , wherein the walker goes down the potential slope indefinitely following a double - exponential growth or even the finite time divergence in the continuum limit . in particular",
    ", we can expect a sudden transition of the movement of prices from a stable state to a highly unstable state even when the market potential function is invariant .",

    "this case is theoretically realizable ; however , the probability of the occurrence of the whole event , which is estimated by the products of probability density of @xmath2 , becomes negligibly small for the cases of bubbles or crashes .",

    ", we should not use the likelihood itself , but apply the information criterion called akaike information criterion ( aic ) that is composed of the logarithm of likelihood and the term of penalty , which depends on the number of parameters , @xmath25 @xcite . @xmath26    using this method , the contour plot of the value of aic for a given time series ( period ii in fig .",
