    "the phenomena of birefringence was already well known at the time when huygens studied the `` strange properties of the island crystal '' @xcite with a view to proving the wave nature of light .",
    "newton also discussed these same properties at length in his _ opticks _ @xcite , but to prove precisely the contrary . in any case , a full mathematical description of the phenomena turned out to be quite cumbersome and it is only in the last few decades that analytic expressions were obtained for the simplest case of a plane electromagnetic wave in an uniaxial crystal @xcite .",
    "generalizations to more realistic waves , such as hermite - gauss , laguerre - gauss or bessel beams , have been so far restricted to paraxial ( or almost paraxial ) approximations @xcite , and to propagations parallel @xcite or perpendicular @xcite to the crystal axis .",
    "the aim of the present work is to obtain the most general expressions describing reflected and refracted ( ordinary and extraordinary ) waves in terms of the properties of a beam impinging at the plane interface of a uniaxial crystal .",
    "analytic formulas are presented in as compact a form as possible . as an example of application",
    ", the propagation of a bessel beam @xcite is studied ; these are electromagnetic modes that propagate in vacuum with an invariant intensity pattern and exhibit polarization and phase optical vortices @xcite yielding an electromagnetic orbital angular momentum ( see , e. g. , ref .",
    "however , as we will show in the following , the intensity pattern inside a birefringent crystal does not remain constant along the main axis of propagation ( unless it coincides with the crystal symmetry axis ) ; moreover optical vortices can be created or destroyed .",
    "@xcite considered the case of a laguerre - gauss beam propagating inside a birefringent crystal and analyzed the evolution of the polarization vortices in terms of stokes parameters . here",
    ", we apply such a study to bessel beams using our analytical expressions , and complement it with a study of the corresponding topological features of phase diagrams .",
    "modern experiments of parametric down - conversion use crystals that are birefringent besides being nonlinear .",
    "these properties are particularly important for generating entangled photons with different dynamical properties determined by their source beam .",
    "thus , for example , when a laguerre - gauss or a bessel beam is taken as a pump , the down - converted light is expected to consist of entangled photons with orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "however , the anisotropy of the birefringent crystals used for that purpose prevent a direct identification of the expected characteristics of the ordinary and extraordinary beams and , consequently , of the properties of the idler and signal photons .",
    "although these are effects of quantum nonlinear optics , their precise characterization must be preceded by a detailed description of the classical linear effects as we present in the following .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in section 2",
    ", a formalism describing electromagnetic waves of any form inside and outside a birefringent crystal is presented ; the boundary conditions at a plane interface are applied in order to obtain explicit expressions for the reflected and refracted waves .",
    "the resulting equations are used in the section 3 to describe a bessel beam incident at an arbitrary angle on the crystal interface ( though the formalism is completely general , the optical axis is taken perpendicular to the interface for simplicity ) ; we show that the reflected and refracted beams are given in terms of a single circuit integral .",

    "it is also worth noticing that the electric field perpendicular to the tilted plane is not negligible .",
    "the reflected , ordinary and extraordinary beams just at the interface posses , as expected , a phase structure qualitatively similar to that shown in fig .  4 in the ( iib ) and ( iic ) plots . in particular , the reflected wave exhibits an elliptic - like symmetry with phase vortices in the plane perpendicular to its axis ; this is shown in the first row of fig .",
