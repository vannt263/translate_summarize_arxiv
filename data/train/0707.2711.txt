    "polypyrrole ( ppy ) is a semiconducting polymer with some unusual properties compared to other organic semiconductors @xcite .",

    "typically , such films have a rather large thickness above 1 micron , and they are highly disordered as well as crosslinked ; maximum conductivities of 1600 s / cm have been reported for stretched films @xcite .",
    "in addition , ppy can be doped electrochemically to a high level , which stabilizes the material properties under ambient conditions @xcite .",
    "a wide range of applications has been demonstrated , such as gas sensors @xcite , biosensors @xcite , or transistors @xcite .",
    "the transport properties of electrochemically synthesized ppy films have been studied extensively @xcite . in the insulating state that is usually present",
    ", the samples typically follow the efros - shklovskii ( es ) variable range hopping model @xcite .",
    "such a system is assumed to be formed by metallic sites separated by tunnel barriers @xcite , which are generated by spatial variations in the charge density .",
    "the electric field dependence of the conductivity was investigated by ribo et al .",

    "metallic _ state which is reached when the electric field is strong enough to delocalize a small fraction ( @xmath4 ) of the charges .",
    "+ chemical synthesis @xcite , on the other hand , allows film preparation on conductive as well as on insulating substrates , thereby complementing the range of applications .",
    "chemically grown films have a pronounced egg - like morphology @xcite , markedly different than the characteristic fibers obtained by electrochemical synthesis . these films are , however , of notoriously poor quality in terms of roughness and conductivity .",
    "for example , their reported maximum room temperature conductivities are @xmath5 @xcite",
    ". this may be the reason why only a very limited number of works have addressed the transport properties of this kind of ppy films .",
    "the existing studies have demonstrated that in films with thicknesses larger than @xmath6 , the temperature dependence @xmath7 of the conductance is consistent with three - dimensional mott variable range hopping , i.e. @xmath8 @xcite . up to now , chemical synthesis of ppy at reduced temperatures has not been reported , which is somewhat surprising considering the profound influence the growth temperature has on the conductivity of electrochemically synthesized films @xcite . + here ,",

    "this and the fact that the doping density depends neither on the growth temperature nor on the volume fraction of the solution indicates that the films are in the fully charged state , corresponding to 0.25 and 0.33 holes per pyrrole ring @xcite . the electronic transport has been studied in eleven samples , all showing qualitatively identical behavior .",
    "typical room temperature conductivities of @xmath22 are found , with no apparent systematic dependence on @xmath23 or on the volume fraction of the solution . at temperatures below @xmath24 , however , samples grown at @xmath15 show substantially lower conductivities than samples grown below this temperature . in the following , we focus on three samples , the parameters of which are summarized in table [ tab:01 ] .",
