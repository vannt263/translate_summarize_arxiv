    "it is a widely spread view that eruptive processes of energy release in the corona are seemingly independent of the dynamics observed in the moderately - varying photosphere .",
    "this view is partially based on the fact that no one - to - one correlation was observed between coronal and photospheric dynamics .",
    "for example , numerous attempts to find any persistent _",
    "pre_-flare changes in the photosphere did not lead to any solid conclusions yet .",
    "although , recent efforts to detect flare - related changes in the photospheric magnetic fields were more successful ( spirock et al . 2002 ; wang et al . 2004 ; sudol & harvey 2005 ; wang 2006 ) . more than a dozen publications by different research groups reported that persistent abrupt changes in the photospheric magnetic flux occur in association with x - class flares .",
    "the most plausible explanation of the observed phenomenon seems to be flare - related changes of the inclination of field lines rooted in the photosphere .",
    "if this is the case ( future analysis of high cadence vector magnetograms could be helpful ) , then we probably deal with a feedback to the photosphere of reorganizing coronal fields .",
    "the question whether there is any forward reaction of the photosphere toward the corona is still open , however .",
    "there seems to be some acceptance that a _ statistical _ relationship may exist between the conditions in the photosphere and corona : for a large enough statistical ensemble of active regions a good correlation has been found between photospheric magnetic parameters and coronal phenomena ( fisher et al . 1998 ; falconer et al .",

    "various mechanisms have been suggested for the energy transport toward the corona that can and should be observationally validated ( see reviews of coronal heating mechanisms , e.g. , malara & velli 1994 ; schrijver & title 2005 ; klimchuk 2006 ) .",
    "although , various statistical correlations do not seem to be adequate any longer and timing characteristics are required .",
    "indeed , when we address issues of coupling between any two systems , a question of vital importance immediately arises : do events that occur in one system persistently precede or follow events in another system ? if the answer is `` yes '' then what is the characteristic time delay between a pair of related events ?",
    "a shorter delay suggests a more close and intimate coupling , while long time delays may indicate less straightforward and more complex relationship .",
    "in particular , in such dynamical systems as magnetized turbulent plasma , the interplay between scales may influence the delay time . in this case",
    "it is advantageous to adopt an intermittency approach , a technique that allows capturing interactions between various scales , in the best way possibly as of today . in the present study",
    ", we undertook an attempt to detect the delay intervals between key moments of the intermittency behavior in the photosphere and corona .",
    "high spatial and temporal resolution measurements of the photospheric magnetic field and solar corona performed recently by a set of _ hinode _ instruments ( kosugi et al . 2007 )",
    "provide us with a unique opportunity to simultaneously estimate degree of intermittency in the photosphere and corona and to track their variations in time .",
    "_ hinode _ sot / fg instrument is designed to produce filter - based vector magnetograms at high spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "strictly speaking , these images only represent measurements of the stockes v polarization parameters at a single wavelength so that information on the magnetic field intensity is not available in these data . however , these data do bear information on the magnetic structuring with an unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.16 arcsec .",
    "these uninterrupted measurements are taken with a high time cadence of 2 minutes and cover several days of observations of an active region .",
    "an example of a sot / fg / hinode magnetogram for noaa ar 10930 is shown in figure [ fig_1 ] ( _ left _ ) , while the right frame shows a simultaneous mdi / hr magnetogram recorded on the same area on the sun .",
    "as far as spatial resolution is concerned , the advantage of the sot / fg data is obvious .",
    "we will analyze properties of photospheric intermittency by utilizing i ) a flatness - function technique , which relates the slope of the function to the degree of intermittency and ii ) calculations of the kinetic vorticity in the photosphere .",
    "three independent data sets were used to calculate the intermittency in the corona and chromosphere : x - ray emission records from the hinode / xrt and goes instruments as well as nobeyama 9.4 ghz polarization flux .",
    "we analyzed active region noaa 10930 observed by hinode in december 2006 . during the passage across the solar disk , this active region displayed at least two periods of enhanced activity separated by a long interval of relative quietness .",
    "the first flaring interval lasted from dec 4 till dec 7 , 2006 , when the active region was very close to the east limb .",
    "as evidenced from a series of mdi full disk magnetograms , at the end of this activity period the magnetic complexity in the active region was nearly exhausted and a new period of complexity gain was setting in .",
    "this second activity period was accompanied by gradual emerging of a fast - rotating sunspot of positive ( n ) polarity located in the close vicinity to the main negative polarity sunspot .",
    "the emergence and rotation of the sunspot ceased with the occurrence of two powerful x - class flares on dec 13 and 14 , 2006 .",
    "the time period between dec 8 , 12:00 ut and dec 13 , 18:45 ut was chosen to study how time variations of magnetic complexity in the photosphere and corona are related .",
    "= 6.0truein    we analyzed 1718 sot / fg @xmath0 re - binned magnetograms taken with the time cadence of 4 minutes . during the analyzed time interval the active region moved across the solar disk from longitude of e37 to w32 , so that the influence of projection effect should be considered .",
    "we integrated longitudinal flux density , @xmath1 , over the entire number , @xmath2 , of pixels of size @xmath3 occupied by the active region .",
    "we thus obtained the longitudinal total unsigned flux , @xmath4 , which is plotted in figure [ fig_2 ] with the light blue curve .",
    "the assumption that the magnetic field in the photosphere is predominantly vertical to the solar surface offers a possibility to estimate the magnetic flux perpendicular to the solar surface , @xmath5 ( murray 1992 ; hagenaar 2001 ) . for each magnetogram",
    ", we calculated the cosine of the angular distance from the center of the magnetogram to the solar disk center , @xmath6 ( figure [ fig_2 ] , pink curve ) .",
    "the perpendicular flux density thus can be estimated as @xmath7 and the deprojected pixel area is @xmath8 , which results in the estimated magnitude of the perpendicular unsigned flux @xmath9 ( figure [ fig_2 ] , dark blue curve ) . inside the time range where @xmath10 ( i.e. , between the dashed vertical line segments in figure [ fig_2 ] ) the perpendicular and longitudinal fluxes differ by less than 10% .",
    "we , therefore , accept that within this time range our data and results are essentially free from the projection effect .",
    "intermittency manifests itself in both spatial ( 2d or 3d ) and temporal ( 1d ) domains . in spatial domain",
    ", intermittency implies a tendency of the magnetic field to concentrate into small - scale flux tubes of high intensity , surrounded by extended areas of much weaker field .",
    "this tendency becomes more pronounced as the spatial resolution of data increases . in temporal domain , intermittency is evidenced via burst - like behavior of events .",
    "studies of intermittency in both spatial and temporal domains can be conducted by using the same techniques such as the structure function approach ( see , e.g. , frisch 1995 ) .",
    "structure function , defined as statistical moments of the increment of a field , is a useful tool for exploring intermittency ( stolovitzky & sreenivasan 1993 ; frisch 1995 ; consolini et al .",
    "1999 ; abramenko et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; abramenko 2005b ; buchlin et al . 2006 ; uritsky et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "= 5.0truein    in our case the analyzed field is the line - of - sight component , @xmath11 , of the photospheric magnetic field so that the structure function can be defined as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a current pixel on a magnetogram , @xmath14 is the separation vector and @xmath15 is the order of a statistical moment , which takes on real values .",
    "angular brackets denote averaging over the magnetogram .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , ratio of the fourth statistical moment of the structure function to the square of the second statistical moment determines the flatness function .",
    "however , in the case of intermittency analysis frisch ( 1995 ) suggested to use even higher statistical moments and to calculate the ( hyper-)flatness , namely , ratio of the sixth moment to the cube of the second moment : @xmath16 for non - intermittent structures , the flatness does not depend on the spatial scale , @xmath17 . on the contrary , for an intermittent structure , the flatness grows as a power - law when the scale @xmath17 decreases ( frisch 1995 , abramenko 2005b ) .",
    "the intermittency index , @xmath18 , determined as the slope of the flatness function within a spatial range of linearity , @xmath19 ( figure [ fig_3 ] ) , increases when intermittency is higher .",
    "we applied the above technique to analyze intermittency in both spatial and temporal domains . to process 1d time series , we modified our 2d flatness function code based on eqs.([sq ] - [ fr ] ) by substituting spatial scale by time scale , @xmath20 , and magnetic field , @xmath11 , by time series of coronal measurements .",
    "first , we determined the flatness functions and intermittency indices for all selected sot / fg magnetograms . to avoid possible contamination of the results from the saturation effect inside the main sunspot and the vast area of weak fields around it ,",
    "only the fields enclosed by the box in figure [ fig_1 ] ( fast rotating spot and flare site ) were taken for calculations .",
    "the range @xmath21 mm , as it is show in figure [ fig_3 ] , was taken the same for all magnetograms .    double green curve in figure [ fig_4 ] shows time profile of @xmath18 in the photosphere .",
    "the intermittency index peaked on dec 11 at about 18:00ut ( day 11.75 ) , which is approximately 1.3 day before the x3.4 flare .",
    "this peak is located inside the projection - free time interval ( between two vertical dashed line segments in figure [ fig_4 ] ) and its magnitude significantly exceeds the error bar , which allows us to consider it as a real change in complexity of the photospheric magnetic field .",
    "second , to explore properties of intermittency in the solar chromosphere and corona , we utilized time series obtained from various instruments such as hinode / xrt , goes and nobeyama radio - polarimeter . both hard x - ray and radio fluxes are direct traces of electrons accelerated in reconnection events .",
    "intermittency analysis based on these data may reveal information on the chromospheric and coronal reconnection dynamics , i.e. , reorganization in the magnetic field .",
    "= 6.0truein    we used 1 min be - thin filter data taken with xrt / hinode instrument ( kosugi et al .",
    "2007 , golub et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the xrt images were processed with the standard sswidl xrt software package and the xrt flux was calculated by integrating pixel intensities over the active region ( figure [ fig_5 ] ) .",
    "the xrt data for this time interval are not continuous .",
    "we analyzed three sub - sets acquired on 9.4 - 10.4 day , 10.4 - 11.4 day , and 13.0 - 13.7 day .",
    "we denoted them as dec 10 , dec 11 , and dec 13 data sets .",
    "each subset contains about 1000 data points .",
    "for each sub - set , we calculated the flatness functions ( figure [ fig_6 ] , _ left _ ) and the intermittency index @xmath18 .",
    "the data presented in figure [ fig_6 ] allow to give an explanation how we select a linear interval , @xmath19 , for the time series . in each case ,",
    "a linear range was detected in the middle part of a spectrum .",
    "we then extended this range in both directions and recalculated the linear fit and the slope , @xmath18 .",
    "we continued to do so while deviations of @xmath18 remained inside the standard deviation of the linear fit , which was in the most of the cases less than 0.05 .",
    "= 5.0truein    polarization flux at 9.4 ghz from nobeyama radioheliograph is shown in figure [ fig_5 ] . the radio emission at this frequency is predominantly determined by the gyro - resonance process and is largely controlled by the strength and dynamics of the magnetic field above active regions ( kundu 1965 ; aschwanden 2002 ) .",
    "we re - binned these 1-second data , so that new time sampling was 30 seconds , and calculated the flatness function for each observing day thus obtaining 5 estimations of @xmath22 .",
    "three of them are presented in figure [ fig_6 ] ( _ right _ ) .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath18 are shown in figure [ fig_4 ] .",
    "as evidenced from both xrt and nobeyama data ( figure [ fig_6 ] ) , the slope of the flatness function gradually steepened from dec 10 to dec 13 , implying a gradual increase of intermittency .",
    "one more interesting detail can be noted in behavior of @xmath22 .",
    "namely , the large - scale end of the linear interval ( i.e. , interval of scales involved into intermittent process ) shifts toward the larger scales as @xmath18 increases ( see the functions for dec 13 ) .",
    "it means that growing intermittency ( complexity ) involves increasingly larger time scales .",
    "note that similar behavior ( involvement of larger spatial scales ) we also observed in the case of the photospheric magnetic field .",
    "= 3.2truein = 3.2truein    .",
    "[ fig_6 ]    the same intermittency calculation routines were applied to the six one - day time series of 1-minute goes 1 - 8    flux .    in figure [ fig_4 ]",
    "we compare the time variations of the intermittency indices in the photosphere , chromosphere and corona .",
    "photospheric data show an undulating behavior with a prominent peak on dec 11 and a gradual decrease after that , while coronal and chromospheric indices continue to increase through dec 13 .",
    "thus the data seem to suggest that intermittency may first increase in the photosphere and then propagates toward the chromosphere and corona .",
    "what processes in the photosphere and beneath are responsible for this gain of complexity and intermittency",
    "? it is thought that convective and turbulent motions of the magnetized plasma in photospheric and sub - photospheric layers could be responsible for the increasing complexity ( see , e.g. , review by klimchuk 2006 ) .",
    "statistical comparisons ( e.g. , abramenko et al . , 2006 ; jing et al . , 2006 ; tan et al . , 2007 ) seem to agree with this assumption .",
    "if so , photospheric dynamics could be compared to the intermittency indices , and the attention should be focused on the kinetics of the photospheric magnetic flux tubes .",
    "hinode sot / fg level0 magnetograms are very well suitable for analyzing horizontal displacements of magnetic elements .",
    "to measure horizontal displacements of magnetic elements and their speed , we utilized the local correlation tracker ( lct ) technique ( strous et al .",
    "1996 ) , which was applied to the same set of sot / fg magnetograms that we used for intermittency analysis .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussian tracking window was @xmath23 arcsec .",
    "this window size was chosen to be an optimum trade off between the noise signal and the spatial resolution of the flow map .",
    "a flow map was calculated for each par of successive images in the data set and is based upon 4 min correlation interval .",
    "our estimation is that the solar noise ( an error signal introduced by the evolution of solar features ) is less than 30 m s@xmath24 .",
    "an example of a flow map derived for the magnetogram in figure [ fig_1 ] ( _ left _ ) is shown in figure [ fig_7 ] .    for each flow map",
    "we then calculated kinetic vorticity , @xmath25 , by using the integral formula : @xmath26 where the integration is performed along the contour @xmath27 enclosing area @xmath28 that contains a current point @xmath29 . in comparison with the traditional differential technique",
    ", our approach appears to be more accurate and offers a possibility to integrate using accurate integration methods , such as simpson formula ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simpsons_rule ) .    in our code , the area @xmath28 was represented by the gaussian tracking window , @xmath30 .",
    "the components of the transverse velocity , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , were interpolated into a refined mesh of @xmath33 pixel size , and then the integration in the ccw direction along the contour @xmath34 $ ] , which encloses a current point @xmath35 , was performed .",
    "integrals along each side of @xmath27 were calculated by the simpson s formula .",
    "for example , an integral along the positive @xmath36-direction ( the bottom side of @xmath27 ) was @xmath37.\\ ] ] here indices @xmath38 belong to the refined mesh , so that @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the sum of four integrals divided by @xmath28 gives us the estimation of the kinetic vorticity at a current point @xmath35 .",
    "we would like to mention that an analog to the kinetic vorticity is electric current which can be calculated by constituting the flow field @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) with the horizontal magnetic field @xmath42 . having the map of @xmath43 , we calculated the averaged over the area squared kinetic vorticity , @xmath44 .",
    "this parameters characterizes the dissipation rate of the kinetic energy in the photosphere caused via random motions of footpoints of magnetic flux tubes .",
    "= 6.0truein    = 5.5truein    in figure [ fig_8 ] we compared the time variation of @xmath44 and the photospheric intermittency index , @xmath18 .",
    "the plot shows that there exists a systematic time lag between the two curves with the intermittency being delayed .",
    "cross - correlation analysis showed that the delay is approximately 4 hours .",
    "this indicates that the gain of intermittency in the photosphere is preceded by the enhanced rate of kinetic energy dissipation . in other words ,",
    "the increase in the kinetic vorticity ( or self - rotation of plasma structures ) leads to subsequent increase of complexity of the photospheric magnetic fields .",
    "presented here case study is devoted to the analysis of emergence of a rotating sunspot in the close vicinity of a mature spot of opposite polarity .",
    "the fact of the rotation was reported by nightingale et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and is considered as a possible energy source for the x - class flares in this active region .",
    "this case demonstrates a rather typical evolution of a delta structure : a highly twisted and stressed magnetic flux rope emerges nearby the pre - existing sunspot .",
    "the emerging sunspot of opposite polarity `` screws '' into the active region magnetic environment .",
    "the interaction of the new and old magnetic flux is accompanied by a chain of processes : interchange reconnection at the interaction boundary , propagation of the magnetic stress and helicity into the corona and gain of complexity in chromospheric and coronal magnetic fields . as a result of magnetic reconnections on a variety of spatial scales , new magnetic connections form .",
    "thus , in this particular case of noaa ar 10930 , kubo et al . ( 2007 ) reported that one day before the x3.4 flare , ca h ii bright loops began appear near the polarity inversion line . in general , continuous injection of energy and associated magnetic re - arrangements may increase magnetic energy stored in active region .",
    "the result often can be a x - class flare , associated with a coronal mass ejection . in noaa",
    "ar 10930 two powerful x - ray flares were observed on dec 13 and 14 , 2006 .",
    "the emergence of the rotating sunspot was associated with undulating variations of the squared kinetic vorticity , @xmath44 .",
    "the most pronounced peak observed about 2 days before the x3.4 flare was followed by an abrupt fall off .",
    "approximately 4 hours after this enhanced activity of photospheric plasma vorticies we observed a peak of the intermittency index of the photospheric magnetic field .",
    "intermittency can be considered as a measure of complexity of the field and implies the tendency of the field to concentrate into extremely strong , widely separated flux tubes ( or sheets ) and a burst - like behavior of energy release in time .",
    "intermittency can increase , in particular , due to fragmentation and merging , as well as due to abrupt intrusion of strong entities .",
    "we therefore suggest that the abrupt exhausting of strong plasma vorticies presented more freedom for magnetic flux tubes and thus facilitated fragmentation and merging processes , eventually resulting in the gain of intermittency in the photosphere .",
    "strongly intermittent photospheric magnetic field represents a more stressed magnetic configuration permeated by a multitude of magnetic field discontinuities , which tend to propagate upward due to the magnetic tension .",
    "after the photospheric magnetic intermittency peaked , the chromospheric and coronal intermittency continued to increase during , at least , one more day .",
    "approximately 1.3 days after the peak of photospheric intermittency , the first x - class flare was launched .",
    "the data allow us to suggest that the magnetic field first became highly intermittent in the photosphere , and then intermittency had penetrated toward the corona , either due to diffusion of magnetic discontinuities , or due to waves of various types and their interactions . as a result ,",
    "a highly critical state of the coronal magnetic configuration was reached , the state which at any instant , due to any perturbance , may lead to an eruption .    in the framework of the intermittency concept , the phenomenological scenario for development of a magnetic structure",
    "can be regarded as evolution of a non - linear dynamical dissipative system , thus offering a more general insight into the phenomenon .",
    "indeed , a non - linear dynamical dissipative system is believed to evolve toward its attractor , which is a self - organized criticality ( soc ) state .",
    "the soc state is characterized by non - rare occurrence of extremely large fluctuations .",
    "which , in turn , results in non - gaussian distributions of various parameters ( recall power - law distributions of flare energy , flare duration , etc . , see , e.g. , lu & hamilton 1991 ; charbonneau et al .",
    "2001 ) and highly intermittent , or , in other words , multifractal organization of the system , as in temporal , so in spatial domain . at the soc state ,",
    "any perturbance can provoke an eruption of any size , and thus an eruption can not be predicted in advance .    of cause , a _ short - time _",
    "prediction may be quite possible ( recall that a snow avalanche , for example , can be `` predicted '' several seconds in advance by sound ) , however , this is actually a post factum prediction based on a finite speed of avalanche propagation .",
    "the same can be said about hard x - ray precursors of h@xmath45 flares .",
    "recently , leka & barnes ( 2007 ) have come to the conclusion that an individual snapshot of an active region hardly bears information about the time of oncoming flare . in our opinion",
    ", this inference perfectly agrees with the concept of non - linear dynamical dissipative system evolution : eruptions can not be predicted .",
    "one can only say that _ when _ the system reached the soc state , strong eruptions can happen frequently enough , along with a multitude of smaller ones .",
    "one of the ways to make a step ahead is to analyze whether the system reached the soc state or it is still at the stage of accumulating the energy and complexity ?",
    "how the soc state can be reached in the corona and what is the role of the photosphere ? in the present study we undertook an attempt tackle these questions .",
    "one should keep in mind also that the soc concept , as any other theory , has their advantages and disadvantages being under continuous elaboration , see , e.g. , belanger et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    as to the usefulness of the intermittency / multifractality concept for understanding of solar phenomena",
    ", it is worth to mention the long - standing problem of appearance of low plasma conductivity in the corona , especially during a flare . to explain a solar eruption on the scale of an active region that can last of about 100 minutes , it is necessary to imply the presence of super strong electric currents @xmath46 inside a very thin layers ( @xmath47 , priest 1982 ) .",
    "a fractal concept of coronal magnetic fields can easy meet these requirements .",
    "indeed , a self - similar fractal allows existence of super thin branches ( magnetic sheets or tubes ) whereas a percolation state , i.e. , a large - scale avalanche of the soc state , implies formation of super strong currents at singular branches of the cluster .",
