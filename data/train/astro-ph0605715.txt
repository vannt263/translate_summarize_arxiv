    "<S> we compare also cross sections derived using different levels of approximation to the vibrational motion .    </S>",
    "<S> the h  </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath0 atom  molecule system is the simplest triatomic system ; but , in spite of its structural simplicity , it has proved difficult to calculate the interaction potential to an accuracy which is sufficient to determine reliably the rotational excitation cross sections near threshold . in the regime of collision energies </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1  k , a potential barrier inhibits h  atom exchange scattering , and rotational excitation of the molecule occurs predominantly through non  exchange scattering ; at higher energies , exchange  scattering occurs also . </S>",
    "<S> these processes contribute to the excitation of h@xmath0 in the interstellar medium , notably in jets associated with star formation . </S>",
    "<S> pure rotational transitions of h@xmath0 have been observed from levels up to @xmath2 ( rosenthal et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) by means of the _ infrared space observatory_.    a recent study of the h  </S>",
    "<S> h@xmath0 potential by mielke et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite appears to have improved on the accuracy of earlier work by boothroyd et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and partridge et al . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whilst all these calculations agree with regard to the general features of the potential , which becomes repulsive at short range and displays only a shallow van der waals minimum of approximately 2  mev ( 20  k ) , there remain significant differences in the predicted anisotropy of the potential ; and it is the anisotropy which determines the magnitude of the rotationally inelastic cross sections . in this letter , we present the results of calculations of cross sections for rotational transitions within the @xmath3 vibrational ground state of h@xmath0 , comparing the values obtained using different determinations of the h  h@xmath0 interaction potential .    when determining the rotational excitation cross sections , it is customary to expand the interaction potential @xmath4 , in terms of legendre polynomials , @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the vector connecting the centre of mass of the h@xmath0 molecule to the h atom , @xmath8 is the vector connecting the nuclei of the molecule , and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> as h@xmath0 is homonuclear , only those terms in the expansion with @xmath10 even are non - zero . the results in figure  [ potential ] </S>",
    "<S> were obtained using a least  squares minimization procedure , which provides an excellent fit to the original potentials when terms through @xmath11 are included in the expansion .     and </S>",

    "<S> mielke et al . </S>",

    "<S> the unit of the potential is k ; @xmath15  k. ]    the behaviour of the term @xmath16 in the classically allowed regions , where @xmath17 , essentially determines the magnitude of the @xmath18 rotationally inelastic cross sections , in the range of collision energies considered here . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ potential ] shows the isotropic term , @xmath19 , and first non - zero anisotropic term , @xmath12 , derived from the potential energies calculated by mielke et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and boothroyd et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the equilibrium internuclear distance , @xmath13  @xmath14 , of the h@xmath0 molecule in its ground vibrational state , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> there is excellent agreement for the isotropic term , @xmath19 , but , as the expanded plot to the right in figure  [ potential ] shows , there are important differences for the first non - zero anisotropic term , @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations of boothroyd et al . imply a @xmath12 term which remains negative beyond its minimum , at @xmath20 @xmath14 , whereas the calculations of mielke et al . </S>",
    "<S> lead to a @xmath12 term which varies between positive and negative values for @xmath21 @xmath14 . for atom </S>",
    "<S>  molecule separations , @xmath22 , which correspond to low classically  allowed energies , the @xmath12 term is small in magnitude for both potentials . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we expect the rotationally inelastic cross sections to be small at low collision energies . this expectation is confirmed by the results reported below . </S>",
    "<S> it is evidently a difficult task to determine reliably the value of the anisotropic term when its magnitude is as small as shown in the right hand panel of figure  [ potential ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note that , in the range of @xmath22 which concerns us here , the @xmath12 coefficient which derives from the calculations of mielke et al . </S>",
    "<S> is in distinctly better agreement with the 1993 results of partridge et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite than with the 1996 results of boothroyd et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    as the collision energy increases and the distance of closest approach decreases , the magnitude of the @xmath12 coefficient increases and we find better agreement between the results deriving from the mielke at el . and boothroyd et al . potentials . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we expect the rotationally inelastic cross sections to increase in magnitude , and the two potentials to yield similar results . </S>",
    "<S> once again , we confirm this expectation below .     </S>",
    "<S> transition , in units of @xmath23 @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the centre  of  mass collision energy is expressed in k , relative to the @xmath25 level . </S>",
    "<S> the full curve was obtained with the potential of mielke et al . , and the broken curve with the potential of boothroyd et al . : ( a ) at the equilibrium internuclear distance , @xmath13  @xmath14 , in the vibrational ground state of the h@xmath0 molecule ; ( b ) using the expectation values of @xmath26 in the vibrational ground state ( equation  ( [ vibrating ] ) ) . ]    in addition to calculating the cross sections with the internuclear separation fixed at its equilibrium value , @xmath13  @xmath14 , in the vibrational ground state , we adopted a more exact approach , consisting of evaluating    @xmath27    where @xmath28 , the vibrational ground state eigenfunction at internuclear separation @xmath29 , differs significantly from zero for @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the vibrational eigenfunction was determined using the method of marston and balint - kurti @xcite and the potential of mielke et al . or boothroyd et al . </S>",
    "<S> , as appropriate .    </S>",
    "<S> rotationally inelastic cross sections were computed using the molcol code @xcite and the exact coupled channels ( cc ) method @xcite . in order to ensure convergence of the cross sections , for the range of collision energies considered in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we included the first 18 rotational states of the h@xmath0 molecule , @xmath31 , in the basis set . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 level lies at an energy of 21412  k above @xmath25 . because hydrogen  atom exchange is assumed not to occur , the ortho and para forms of h@xmath0 remain distinct , and separate calculations were performed including either the levels with @xmath33 odd or the levels with @xmath33 even . </S>",
    "<S> the first six terms @xmath34 in the expansion ( [ potential ] ) of the potential were used in the calculations .    in figure  [ paracombined]a </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the cross section for de - excitation , @xmath35 , as calculated with the potentials of mielke et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and boothroyd et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for the case of a fixed internuclear separation , @xmath13  @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> as anticipated , the cross - section tends to increase with the collision energy , and results obtained with the two potentials come into agreement . </S>",
    "<S> however as the collision energy decreases , the results obtained with the potential of mielke et al . </S>",
    "<S> fall increasingly below those derived from the other potential , before rising again towards the @xmath36 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> these differences relate to to the @xmath12 term in the potential expansion ( see figure  [ potential ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that the cross sections shown in figure  [ paracombined]a are reproducible by the independent scattering code molscat @xcite , to within the plotting accuracy .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ orthocombined]a shows the corresponding results for the @xmath37 , transition of ortho  h@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour of this cross section is similar to that seen in figure  [ paracombined]a , for the equivalent transition in para  h@xmath0 , except close to threshold ( @xmath38  k ) , where both potentials yield a cross section which decreases with @xmath39 . once again </S>",
    "<S> , these results have been verified using molscat .    , but for the @xmath37 transition . </S>",
    "<S> the centre  of  mass collision energy is expressed in k , relative to the @xmath25 level . </S>",
    "<S> cross sections obtained using @xmath40 are shown in panel ( a ) , and those derived using equation  ( [ vibrating ] ) in panel ( b ) . ]    in figures  [ paracombined]b and [ orthocombined]b , the rotational de - excitation cross sections for para and ortho  h@xmath0 are compared for the case in which equation  ( [ vibrating ] ) was used to evaluate the potential expansion coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> results obtained in this way should be more accurate than those derived assuming the internuclear distance , @xmath29 , to be fixed at its equilibrium value . </S>",
    "<S> we see features in the cross sections which are similar to those apparent in figures  [ paracombined]a and [ orthocombined]a . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancies between the results obtained using different potentials are even greater than previously for collision energies @xmath41  k. additional calculations were performed for models in which simple harmonic oscillator and morse oscillator eigenfunctions were used in equation  ( [ vibrating ] ) ; they yielded results which are intermediate between those in figures  [ paracombined ] and [ orthocombined ] and show the same features .    </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the behaviour with collision energy and the magnitudes of the cross sections relate to the @xmath12 term in the expansion of the interaction potential . for scattering at low energies , the region @xmath42 @xmath14 is relevant , where the @xmath12 coefficient calculated by mielke et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is in distinctly better agreement with that of partridge et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite than that of boothroyd et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , it was not surprising to find that the cross sections which derive from potentials @xcite and @xcite are also in better agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the rms and largest errors in the interaction energies computed by boothroyd et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 85.59  k and 1958.57  k , respectively ) and mielke et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3.25  k and 87.61  k , respectively ) are to be compared with @xmath43  k for @xmath42 @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the rms error quoted for surface of mielke et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite approaches that required to calculate reliably the cross sections for at least the @xmath18 rotationally inelastic transitions . in the absence of any independent test of the accuracy of the calculated interaction potentials , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the cross sections computed with the potential of mielke et al . </S>",
    "<S> are to be preferred .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the low  energy cross sections which derive from the potential surface of mielke et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite are even smaller than those obtained using the surface of boothroyd et al . , with values which fall to the order of @xmath44 @xmath24 for @xmath45  k ; the corresponding thermal rate coefficient is of the order @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 s@xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the rate coefficients for the @xmath35 and @xmath37 transitions in h@xmath0 , induced by collisions with he atoms at @xmath49  k @xcite . in the interstellar medium , </S>",
    "<S> the elemental number density ratio of helium to hydrogen is @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , even if the hydrogen is mainly in atomic rather than molecular form , collisions with helium atoms will dominate the rotational excitation of the residual molecular hydrogen , owing to the much larger values of the he  h@xmath0 rate coefficients . </S>"
