    "( 2005 ) presented the results of a detailed numerical investigation of the phenomenon of _ arnold diffusion _ ( arnold 1964 ) in a hamiltonian system of three degrees of freedom that satisfies sufficient conditions for the holding of the _ nekhoroshev theorem _",

    "the aim of these studies was to establish quantitative estimates as regards a ) the critical value of the small parameter @xmath5 below which the system enters into the so - called ` nekhoroshev regime ' , and b ) the dependence of the local diffusion coefficient @xmath6 , along a particular resonance , on @xmath1 . in guzzo",
    "( 2005 ) the authors reported to have also numerically observed global diffusion over an extended domain of the arnold web .",
    "other numerical studies over the years related to the same problem are : kaneko and konishi ( 1989 ) , wood et al .",

    "( 1997 ) , giordano and cincotta ( 2004 ) . some early results of the literature are briefly commented in the discussion .    in what follows we focus on an analysis of point ( b ) above . according to lega et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , a tedious numerical calculation yields that the local diffusion coefficient @xmath6 along a resonance depends monotonically on @xmath1 .",
    "while the limited range of the numerical data did not allow for a precise fitting , the authors presented evidence that the numerical function @xmath7 was decreasing faster than a power - law @xmath8 , while it was consistent with an exponential law @xmath9 for some unspecified constant @xmath10 . a subsequent study in a mapping model analogous to the above hamiltonian model yielded the concrete estimate @xmath11 ( froeschl et al .",
    "2005 ) .    in the present paper",
    "our aim is to provide a deeper understanding of these numerical results by having recourse , precisely , to the analytical apparatus of the nekhoroshev theory , that is , the construction of a _ resonant birkhoff normal form _ and of estimates on the size of the remainder @xmath12 of the normal form at the optimal order of normalization .",
    "the optimal remainder function @xmath13 is a crucial quantity for the dynamics because it represents the true size of the perturbation of the system that corresponds to its deviation from an integrable system .",
    "indeed , in nekhoroshev theory all bounds on the variations of the actions follow from estimates on the size of @xmath13 . in order , therefore , to establish the link between the nekhoroshev theory , on the one hand , and the problem of the speed of diffusion , on the other hand , in the present paper we seek to determine :    \\a ) the dependence of the local diffusion coefficient @xmath6 on the size of the remainder @xmath0 at the optimal order of normalization , and    \\b ) the precise dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 . in particular , we seek to calculate @xmath0 when @xmath1 becomes small enough so that the exponentially small scaling of @xmath0 with @xmath1 clearly shows up .",
    "this required to consider values of @xmath1 one order of magnitude smaller than the values considered in the numerical experiments of lega et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "we can immediately state a brief summary of our main results .",
    "we find that :    \\a ) @xmath6 scales with @xmath0 as a power law @xmath14 , with @xmath15 . to determine this relation , use was made of the data of lega et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the numerical values of @xmath6 , and a program was written by the author in order to compute the birkhoff normal form and thereby the remainder @xmath13 .",
    "\\b ) in the range @xmath16 , @xmath0 scales as @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this also yields the exponential scaling @xmath20 .",
    "note that the exponentially small scaling shows up clearly only for @xmath21 , while in the range @xmath22 a power - law fitting @xmath23 yields marginally better results than the exponential fitting .",
    "in fact , we find that although the onset of the ` nekhoroshev regime ' can be placed at a threshold value @xmath24 , the deviation of the remainder from a power law becomes clear only for @xmath1 one order of magnitude smaller than this value .",
    "the computational algorithm used to obtain the above results is described in section 2 .",
    "it follows essentially the normalization scheme described in the lecture notes on exponential stability of giorgilli ( 2002 , pp.86 - 87 ) .",
    "this scheme is different from the traditional scheme based on normalization by successive orders of @xmath1 .",
    "we further modify it to avoid using @xmath25truncated resonant modules ( see section 2 ) .",
    "people working on mathematical aspects of the nekhoroshev theory are definitely familiar with all related notions .",
    "however , a somewhat extended description is given in section 2 , to help rendering the subject more accessible also to people oriented towards the applications .",
    "section 3 then focuses on the implementation of the algorithm in the particular model of froeschl et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . by constructing the normal form and identifying the optimal order of normalization",
    ", the size of @xmath13 is evaluated for various values of @xmath1 .",
    "this yields the exponential scaling of @xmath0 on @xmath1 . using also the data of lega et al .",
    "( 2003 ) yields the power - law relation of @xmath6 with @xmath0 .",
    "section 4 contains a brief discussion of the results .",
    "the analytical part of the nekhoroshev theorem is based on the construction of a normal form for a @xmath26 degrees of freedom hamiltonian system of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 are action - angle variables , @xmath29 satisfies appropriate non - degeneracy and convexity conditions , and @xmath30 is analytic in a complexified domain of the actions and the angles .",
    "we shall be concerned with a _ local _ construction of a normal form for the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , valid within some ( small ) preselected open domain @xmath31 of the action space ( the index @xmath10 means action space ) .",
    "the analyticity condition implies that if @xmath32 is fourier expanded @xmath33 there are positive constants @xmath34 such that for all values of @xmath35 the coefficients @xmath36 are bounded by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , bounds on the function @xmath32 can be found in domains @xmath39 , for any positive @xmath40 .",
    "now , the purpose of the normal form construction is to perform a series of canonical transformations @xmath41 , such that , after @xmath42 normalization steps , the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath43 in the last expression , the first term @xmath44 , called the _ normal form _ ,",
    "is constructed in such a way as to yield a simple dynamics in the variables @xmath45 ( e.g. in the non - resonant or simply resonant case the hamiltonian @xmath44 is integrable ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the second term @xmath46 , called the _ remainder _ , represents a perturbation to the dynamics induced by the normal form .",
    "the goal of the theory is to proceed with the normalization as far as necessary in order to minimize the size of the remainder . in exceptional cases of _ integrable _ hamiltonian systems one may proceed by infinitely many steps , within some domain of convergence , and",
    "show that the remainder tends to zero in the limit @xmath47 . in the generic case of non - integrable systems , however , one can only reduce @xmath46 to a finite minimum size .",
    "this is found at a specific order of normalization which is hereafter called the optimal order of normalization @xmath48 .",
    "the size of the remainder @xmath49 for any other order @xmath50 is bigger than the size of @xmath51 .",
    "standard theory yields estimates @xmath52 and @xmath53 for some positive integers @xmath54 depending on the number of degrees of freedom .    the classical construction leading to expressions of the form ( [ hamnorm ] ) is nowadays analyzed in many books ( see e.g. boccaletti and pucacco ( 1996 ) , contopoulos ( 2002 ) , morbidelli ( 2002 ) , or ferraz - mello ( 2007 ) for instructive introductions ) .",
    "the main steps can be summarized as follows :    \\a ) one makes a choice as regards which fourier terms @xmath55 in @xmath32 will be retained and which terms will be eliminated in the normalized hamiltonian .",
    "the terms to be retained are specified by their integer vector @xmath56 belonging to a particular subset of @xmath57 called _ resonant module _ ( denoted hereafter by @xmath58 ) ) .",
    "the choice of resonant module is dictated by the location of the domain @xmath31 in the action space , i.e. , by whether this domain is close to or far from particular resonances ( see subsection 2.3 ) .",
    "\\b ) the fourier terms not belonging to @xmath59 are the ones to be eliminated by a canonical transformation .",
    "let us consider the first normalization step .",
    "we shall consider canonical transformations of old variables @xmath60 to new variables @xmath61 obtained via a lie generating function @xmath62 .",
    "the function @xmath62 will be selected so as to be of the ` first order of smallness ' ( the precise meaning of this sentence is analyzed below ) .",
    "the canonical transformation is defined by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the poisson bracket operator , and @xmath65 is the formal exponential development of @xmath66 .",
    "a well known property of lie transformations is that for any function of the canonical variables @xmath67 one has @xmath68 as a result , the transformed hamiltonian , after the action of the generating function @xmath69 is given by @xmath70    in order to specify the function @xmath62 , we select from @xmath32 all the terms satisfying the following two conditions : a ) being of the ` first order of smallness ' , and b ) not belonging to @xmath58 . denoting by @xmath71 the sum of these terms , the terms are eliminated by selecting @xmath69 so as to satisfy : @xmath72 equation ( [ homo1 ] ) is called homological .",
    "it is reduced to a diagonal system of linear algebraic equations .",
    "namely , writing @xmath71 as @xmath73 and setting @xmath74 we find , through ( [ homo1 ] ) , the solution for the coefficients @xmath75 given by : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the frequency vector of the unperturbed hamiltonian at the point @xmath78 of the action space .",
    "\\c ) in the same way we eliminate the terms of the second order of smallness in @xmath79 or , in general , the terms of the r - th order of smallness in @xmath80 . the recursive formulae for the r - th canonical transformation @xmath81",
    ", @xmath82 are : @xmath83 following iteratively the above procedure , the function @xmath84 takes the form ( [ hamnorm ] ) .",
    "the remainder consists of all the terms of @xmath84 of ` order of smallness ' larger than @xmath42 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath85 this series is an analytic function in a restriction of the domain of analyticity of the original hamiltonian provided that the lie transformation in ( [ nfrec ] ) is convergent at every step ( which is ensured for ` small enough ' generating functions @xmath86 ) .",
    "a clarification of the meaning of ` order of smallness ' is now in order .",
    "when one implements the recursive scheme of eqs.([lietran ] ) and ( [ nfrec ] ) , one needs to decide how should @xmath84 at every step be split into terms of different orders .",
    "such a splitting should be based on the size of each term relative to the size of the other terms . in a computer program ,",
    "it is customary to introduce a so - called ` book - keeping ' parameter @xmath87 .",
    "this is a parameter the powers of which appear as coefficients in front of the various terms in the expansion . a term with coefficient @xmath88",
    "is said to be ` of order of smallness ' @xmath89 .",
    "this helps separating the terms in the program by , say , recalling the @xmath90 in an algebraic program like mathematica in order to get the term @xmath91 in eq.([nfrec ] ) . as the program carries on the normalization , the book - keeping coefficients change",
    "according to the rule that the coefficient of the poisson bracket of two terms with coefficients @xmath88 and @xmath92 is @xmath93 . in the end",
    "we set @xmath94 to recover the correct values of all the coefficients .",
    "this way of organizing the series is practical , but it also reflects a fundamental decision on what quantity we consider to represent ` smallness ' in the perturbation series .",
    "if the overall size of @xmath32 is an @xmath95 quantity , then it is customary to identify @xmath1 itself as the small parameter .",
    "in that case the normalization scheme proceeds by ascending powers of @xmath1 , and the generating functions @xmath86 are of order @xmath96 .",
    "we shall see in subsection 2.4 how to modify the ` book - keeping ' so as to separate terms of different smallness which co - exist within @xmath32 , and then within @xmath84 , provided that the function @xmath32 satisfies analyticity conditions of the form ( [ expbd ] ) .",
    "the choice of resonant module depends on the location of the domain @xmath31 in the action space and on the properties of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath29 .",
    "let us consider the homological equation of the first order under the choice of book - keeping @xmath97 .",
    "this reads : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the part of @xmath32 containing terms to be eliminated .",
    "the solution of ( [ homo2 ] ) is @xmath100 provided that the resonant manifolds @xmath101 are dense in the action space , for any small open domain @xmath31 there are infinitely many resonant manifolds crossing @xmath31 .",
    "this implies that there is a dense set of values of the actions @xmath78 within @xmath31 for which a divisor in ( [ homosol2 ] ) becomes exactly equal to zero . in practice",
    ", this means that a generating function like @xmath69 in ( [ homosol2 ] ) can not in fact be determined in any open domain @xmath31 . in nekhoroshev theory , an often stated remedy to this problem consists of splitting the set of fourier harmonics @xmath102 into low order and high order harmonics according to whether @xmath103 is smaller or larger than some positive integer @xmath104 ( see , for example , morbidelli and guzzo 1997 ) .",
    "the choice of value of @xmath104 is arbitrary , but the choice @xmath105 , for some constant @xmath10 , is suggested by the request that there be no overlapping of the resonant domains ( of width @xmath106 ) formed around each of the resonant manifolds @xmath101 , with @xmath107 , other than the overlapping near the loci at which the manifolds intersect each other ( see morbidelli 2002 , p.119 ) . fixing @xmath104 and requesting that only the harmonics with @xmath107 be normalized ensures that divisors @xmath108 with @xmath109 will not appear in the series .",
    "furthermore , the domain @xmath31 is crossed by only a _",
    "finite _ number of resonant manifolds with @xmath107 .",
    "more precisely , denoting by @xmath110 the subset of integer vectors @xmath56 for which the resonant manifolds @xmath111 intersect the domain @xmath112 , and by @xmath113 a subset of @xmath110 such that any vector of @xmath110 can be produced by a linear combination of the vectors of @xmath113 with integer coefficients , the relevant property is that @xmath113 contains only a finite number of vectors @xmath56 with @xmath107 and an infinite number of vectors with @xmath114 . denoting by @xmath115 the subset of vectors @xmath116 with @xmath107 , the resonant module @xmath117 is determined by :",
    "@xmath118 let @xmath119 be the complement of @xmath120 with respect to @xmath110 . under the ` book - keeping ' choice @xmath97 ,",
    "one then has the following iterative algorithm of determination of the normal form locally , i.e. , within the domain @xmath112 :    \\a ) assuming that @xmath121 normalization steps were completed , split @xmath122 as @xmath123 , where @xmath124 contains all the terms with @xmath107 not belonging to @xmath125 .",
    "\\b ) determine the generating function @xmath86 by solving @xmath126    \\c ) find the new hamiltonian @xmath127 in which @xmath128 , @xmath129 are normal form terms belonging to the resonant module @xmath125 , @xmath130 contains all the fourier terms belonging to @xmath119 , and @xmath131 contains the remaining fourier terms that are not in any of the previously determined sets .",
    "this completes one step of the iteration algorithm . as shown in morbidelli and giorgilli ( 1997 ) , while all the terms of order higher than @xmath42 in these two functions are bounded by a quantity @xmath132 , i.e. , they are both exponentially small in @xmath104 , the terms of @xmath130 are the ones making the leading contribution to the remainder .",
    "two problems arise in the implementation of the above algorithm :    \\a ) eqs.([homosol1 ] ) or ( [ homosol2 ] ) imply that the denominators of all the series coefficients are functions of the actions , in the form of products of divisors @xmath133 .",
    "this implies that even if @xmath134 is polynomial in the actions , the fourier coefficients of the terms @xmath102 in @xmath84 or @xmath135 are in general rational in the actions .",
    "the extra computational load of dealing with rational expressions ( and their derivatives entering into poisson brackets ) makes the whole algorithm hardly tractable in this form .",
    "we defer the solution of this problem after the analysis of point ( b ) below , to which it is linked .",
    "\\b ) one needs to store many more intermediate coefficients than those eventually needed in order to have a complete knowledge of the transformed hamiltonian or of the generating function within any specified domain of interest .",
    "this is a rather technical problem , the solution of which is , nevertheless , crucial in constructing an efficient algorithm for the computation of the normal form . a detailed quantitative discussion of this problem is deferred to the appendix .",
    "here we state the main result : under the book - keeping scheme @xmath97 , assume we are interested in specifying the transformed hamiltonian in a ` domain of interest ' defined by the maximum orders @xmath136 , where @xmath137 denotes the maximum order in the book - keeping variable @xmath1 and @xmath138 denotes the maximum order in fourier space .",
    "then , in order to be able to specify all the terms belonging to the ` domain of interest ' , we must store , at intermediate normalization orders @xmath139 , all the hamiltonian terms of fourier order @xmath140 .",
    "as shown in the appendix these intermediate terms outnumber by far the terms finally stored within the ` domain of interest ' .    issue ( b ) can be resolved by introducing a different book - keeping of the terms , on the basis of their _ fourier order _ rather than @xmath141order .",
    "this organization of the series is analyzed in detail in giorgilli ( 2002 , pp.86 - 87 ) and we present the main points of this analysis in the appendix . essentially , it reflects the fact that for any order @xmath139 , many fourier terms with a coefficient @xmath142 in front , which would thus be formally stored as of order @xmath143 under the book - keeping @xmath144 , are actually of much smaller size than @xmath142 , because the size of any @xmath102 term scales as @xmath145 by virtue of the analyticity condition .",
    "this scaling is already present in the original hamiltonian and it propagates at all subsequent normalization steps .",
    "precisely , this fact is recognized by ` book - keeping ' the terms on the basis of their fourier rather than @xmath1-order .",
    "the exact algorithm , which replaces the algorithm of subsection ( 2.3 ) , reads as follows :    \\1 ) define @xmath146,1\\}$ ] .",
    "\\2 ) place a book - keeping coefficient @xmath88 in front of each fourier term of the form @xmath102 in @xmath32 , where @xmath147 + 1 $ ] .",
    "\\3 ) carry on the normalization ( eqs.([nfrec ] ) ) by successive powers of @xmath87 .",
    "as shown in the appendix , with such an algorithm there are no extra terms , outside the domain of interest , that need to be computed .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to incorporate a solution to issue ( a ) in the same algorithm .",
    "first , we notice that , as defined in step ( 1 ) above , the constant @xmath148 does not pose an upper bound ( like @xmath104 ) in the order of the fourier harmonics being normalized at successive steps , since the algorithm requests that terms of increasing order @xmath149 be normalized at the r - th normalization step . in principle , this would cause a problem when @xmath42 becomes larger than @xmath150 .",
    "but in practice , one wishes to avoid the problem of the appearance of the actions in the denominators of the fourier coefficients for both @xmath107 or @xmath109 , that is for both @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "it can be shown ( section 3 ) that if the domain @xmath31 is resonant , that is @xmath153 , the width of @xmath31 scales with @xmath1 as @xmath106 .",
    "non - resonant domains can also be covered by subdomains of size @xmath106 .",
    "choosing a point @xmath154 in the interior of the domain @xmath155 , we then develop the hamiltonian locally , within @xmath155 , by expanding the actions as @xmath156 the transformation @xmath157 is not canonical under the usual poisson structure , but the dynamics remains unaltered if a new hamiltonian @xmath158 substitutes @xmath30 as generator of the equations of motion .",
    "for example , in a thirring - type model @xmath159 we get , introducing also the ` book - keeping ' parameter @xmath87 : @xmath160 + 1}c_{k_1,k_2 } \\exp(i(k_1\\phi_1+k_2\\phi_2))\\bigg)~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , the perturbation has been rescaled to @xmath161 , i.e. , it follows the size @xmath106 of the domain @xmath31 .",
    "nevertheless , the unperturbed frequencies are now @xmath162 , thus they do not depend on the actions , since the terms quadratic in the actions are now formally of order @xmath87 .",
    "this implies that the divisors are of the form @xmath163 , i.e. , independent of the actions .",
    "consequently , the algorithm proceeds with polynomial rather than rational ( in the actions ) fourier coefficients at every step .",
    "this also means that there is no longer need for introducing a k - truncated resonant module .",
    "thus , in all calculations the resonant module is specified only by the resonances between the frequencies @xmath164 .",
    "if @xmath164 are incommensurable , one may specify a module corresponding either to no resonance or to an approximate resonance between the frequencies @xmath164 . as discussed by morbidelli ( 2002 , p.48 - 49 ) ,",
    "such a construction is still consistent with the appearance of an exponentially small remainder at the optimal order of normalization .",
    "this is because , as demonstrated in the appendix , the order of normalization has a linear relation with the maximum fourier order of the terms contained in the normal form .",
    "furthermore , we find that @xmath165 which also implies @xmath166 .",
    "hence the dominant terms in the remainder are of fourier order @xmath167 , i.e. , they have a size @xmath168 .",
    "this means that @xmath169 plays now a role similar to @xmath104 in subsection 2.3 .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that such a result is obtained here _ a posteriori _ ,",
    "i.e. , after the construction of the series .",
    "that is , with the present algorithm one may proceed by calculating the series up to any desired value of @xmath42 , and then by checking whether the optimal order @xmath48 was reached .",
    "this will also specify automatically the optimal order @xmath169 . on the contrary , following the algorithm of subsection ( 2.3 ) , one would have to fix a value of @xmath104 in advance and then check whether such a value yields the optimal estimate for the remainder .",
    "otherwise , the calculation should be repeated from the start , by making a different choice of @xmath104 .",

    "a careful examination of all the lie operations taking place up to the order @xmath137 shows that in order to obtain complete knowledge of the transformed hamiltonian in a domain @xmath136 , one must store , for every order @xmath139 , all the hamiltonian terms of fourier order @xmath349 .",
    "this extended domain , shown by the triangular domain of figure  1a , contains many more terms than those of the domain of interest ( the ratio of the number of terms in the two domains is proportional to the ratio of the areas of the domains raised to a power @xmath350 , where @xmath26 is the number of degrees of freedom ) .    at this point",
    "we may argue that , for sufficiently large @xmath138 , the terms with @xmath351 have very small size because of the analyticity condition ( eq.([expbd ] ) ) , so that they can probably be ignored without great modification of the results .",
    "however , precisely this type of argument brings about the real source of the above problem , which is the choice of ` book - keeping ' @xmath97 . the fact that the triangular domain of figure  1a contains many more terms than the gray parallelogram in the same figure simply depicts failure to recognize that for any order @xmath139 , many fourier terms formally stored as of order @xmath143 are actually of much smaller size than @xmath142 .",
    "for example , while @xmath32 is an overall @xmath95 quantity , not all the fourier terms in @xmath32 have a similar size , because the size of an @xmath102 term in @xmath32 scales as @xmath145 .",
    "this initial scaling propagates also at subsequent orders of normalization .",
    "this fact suggests that the terms should be ` book - kept ' differently , i.e. , on the basis of their fourier order rather than their @xmath1-order .    following the algorithm exposed in subsection 2.4 ( steps ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) )",
    ", the domain of interest ( figure 1b ) is made to coincide with the domain in which terms should be stored , i.e. , terms within the gray - shaded area can only be produced by poisson bracket operations between terms which are also within the gray shaded area .",
    "in particular , the meaning of step ( 2 ) is that in a hamiltonian like ( [ ham ] ) the parameter @xmath1 is not so relevant in characterizing the smallness of the various terms in @xmath32 ( @xmath1 can in fact be incorporated in the book - keeping scheme , as was done in section 3 ) .",
    "a formal analogy can be made with a polynomial hamiltonian around an elliptic equilibrium : @xmath352 in the case of the hamiltonian ( [ hampol ] ) it is customary to proceed by normalizing iteratively by the degrees of the monomial terms in the canonical variables rather than by powers of @xmath1 .",
    "such a choice underlines that the real smallness in the polynomial case is the distance @xmath353 from the equilibrium point .",
    "in fact , it is often convenient to rescale the whole hamiltonian ( [ hampol ] ) so that @xmath1 disappears from the lowest order terms of the polynomial expansion in the r.h.s . of ( [ hampol ] ) .",
    "the analogy with the generic case becomes clear by introducing action - angle variables @xmath354 , @xmath355 , @xmath356 .",
    "we then readily find that a fourier term of order @xmath357 is always of fourier order @xmath358 ( and @xmath206 has the same parity as @xmath42 ) .",
    "the relevant domain of interest is thus limited by the equation @xmath359 which yields a domain very similar to fig.7b ( the only difference is in the slope of the limiting upper line , which is @xmath360 $ ] in fig.7b and @xmath361 in the polynomial case ) ."
