    "the neutron has zero net electric charge , but it is composed of charged quarks so it may have an internal charge distribution . if so the neutron will interact electrostatically with other charged particles such as electrons . in a scattering experiment it is useful to parameterize the neutron charge distribution using the sachs electric form factor @xmath1 , the spatial fourier transform of the neutron charge density in the breit ( brick wall ) frame , _",
    "i.e. _ in the frame where the neutron s initial momentum is @xmath2@xmath3 = @xmath4@xmath5@xmath6 and its final momentum is @xmath2@xmath7 = @xmath8@xmath5@xmath6 @xcite . writing the electric form factor as a multipole expansion in @xmath9 we have : @xmath10 at @xmath11 the electric form factor is simply the neutron s net charge : @xmath12 . in the low @xmath9 limit @xmath1 is dominated by the second term which contains the neutron mean square charge radius ( mscr ) @xmath13 , the second moment of the neutron charge density : @xmath14 from ( [ ge ] ) we see that @xmath13 determines the slope of the form factor at @xmath11 : @xmath15 in the subfield of nuclear physics concerned with understanding nucleon structure , one measures @xmath1 as a function of @xmath9 by scattering electrons from light nuclei at various energies and compares it to the predictions of theoretical models . for this program ( [ geslope ] )",
    "is an important constraint on the shape of @xmath1 .",
    "theoretically there are several ways of understanding how a nonzero @xmath13 might arise .",
    "the simple su(6 ) quark model predicts @xmath1 to be identically zero , and hence @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the known @xmath17 mass splitting implies a spin - dependent quark interaction that breaks su(6 ) symmetry .",
    "such a force would also tend to pull the up quark to the center of the neutron and push the down quarks to the edge , producing a nonzero @xmath1 and specifically a negative @xmath13 @xcite . in another picture",
    "every neutron spends part of its time as a virtual proton - pion pair @xcite . in this state",
    "the lighter @xmath18 orbits the heavier proton , making a negative @xmath13 .",
    "recent theoretical efforts to calculate @xmath13 produce a negative sign but a large uncertainty on its magnitude @xcite .    in an experiment ,",
    "the total coherent scattering length for neutron - atom scattering ( far from any resonances and neglecting small effects such as the neutron s electric polarizability ) is given by : @xmath19 b_{ne}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the nuclear scattering length and @xmath0 is the neutron - electron scattering length , responsible for the electrostatic interaction between the neutron and a charged particle ( _ e.g. _ electron ) .",
    "the first term in brackets corresponds to the nuclear electric charge and the second term to the atomic electrons .",
    "the form factor @xmath21 is the spatial fourier transform of the atomic electron charge distribution for momentum transfer @xmath22 .",
    "the net charge of the particle and its internal charge distribution both contribute to @xmath0 . for neutron - atom scattering at low momentum transfer the second term in ( [ ge ] ) dominates . from scattering theory , using the 1@xmath23 born approximation , one obtains : @xmath24 in recent experimental determinations of @xmath0 , total transmission cross sections are measured for epithermal and thermal neutrons on lead and bismuth targets @xcite .",
    "these studies , and also the earlier work of krohn and ringo @xcite using noble gas targets , contribute to the particle data group s recommended value of @xmath25 @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this includes a scale factor of 1.3 to account for a minor disagreement .",
    "there is a much larger and still unexplained disagreement between measurements of @xmath0 from transmission measurements and older determinations neutron diffraction on crystals @xcite .",
    "recently s.  a.  werner proposed a new approach for a precision measurement of @xmath0 using neutron interferometry .",
    "the basic experimental setup is illustrated in figure [ f : setup ] , which shows a standard lll perfect crystal silicon neutron interferometer and the usual phase flag ( _ e.g. _ fused silica ) .",
    "the neutron beam is split into two paths by bragg diffraction , and the relative phase shift caused by different path lengths in the phase flag produces interference fringes in the neutron counters c@xmath27 and c@xmath28 .",
    "detailed introductions to the theory and operation of neutron inteferometers can be found in @xcite .",
    "a separate perfect crystal silicon sample , cut from the same ingot as the interferometer , is placed across both downstream paths .",
    "this sample can be rotated about all three axes .",
    "it is aligned precisely to the bragg condition ( parallel to the interferometer blades ) and then rotated by a small misset angle @xmath29 as indicated . the neutron phase as a function of @xmath29 over a range of @xmath30 arcsec from bragg",
    "is then measured .",
    "very close to bragg the neutron obtains a _",
    "dynamical _ phase shift that originates from the transition to the @xmath31 and @xmath32 solutions for the internal wave vector . according to dynamical diffraction theory this",
    "is given by @xcite : @xmath33 where the minus ( plus ) sign corresponds to the @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) solution . here",
    "@xmath34 is the probability for bragg scattering per unit path length , related to the crystal structure function @xmath35 for this reflection by @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is a scaled misset angle : @xmath38 @xmath39 is the crystal thickness , and @xmath40 is the bragg angle . because the crystal sample extends through both beam paths the kinematic phase cancels and the dynamical phase adds , producing a net relative phase : @xmath41 with the plus ( minus ) sign corresponding to positive ( negative ) misset angles .",
    "a plot of @xmath42 _ vs. _ @xmath29 is shown in figure [ f : delphi ] .",
    "the sample crystal is suspended on a shaft connected to a 10 cm lever , which is moved by a self - calibrated pzt nanopositioner that steps over a range of 25 @xmath43 m with 0.1 nm precision ( p-753 , physik instrumente , karlsruhe , germany @xcite ) .",
    "the shaft rotates on a nylon flexure bearing , there are no sliding or rolling contacts , so the crystal rotates smoothly and the misset angle can be measured to 10@xmath44 arcsec .    the neutron interferometer can measure the net relative phase shift @xmath42 to within 1@xmath45 in a single interferogram ( in about 1000 s ) the silicon lattice constant , neutron wavelength , and crystal thickness @xmath39 are all known at the 10@xmath46 precision level .",
    "therefore by fitting the measured phase shift as a function of misset angle to equation [ e : delphi ] one can with some effort determine @xmath34 , and hence @xmath35 , to an absolute precision of about @xmath47 .",
    "near the bragg condition the structure factor is related to the coherent scattering length ( see [ e : bcoh ] ) by : @xmath48 b_{ne } \\right).\\ ] ] in our case @xmath49 @xcite is the form factor calculated for the reciprocal lattice vector corresponding to the ( 111 ) reflection in silicon . in equation",
    "[ e : onb ] , @xmath20 is about 240 times larger than @xmath50 b_{ne}$ ] . by rotating the crystal off bragg far enough that the dynamical phase is negligible we can measure @xmath20 _ in situ _ with a relative uncertainty of less than 10@xmath46 , limited only by the uncertainty in the phase measurement , and subtract it from equation [ e : onb ]",
    "this will allow a determination of @xmath0 and hence @xmath13 with a net uncertainty of about 0.7% , more than a factor of three improvement from the present accepted value , and using a technique systematically much different from other precision measurements .",
    "if the experiment with silicon is successful we may repeat it using a perfect germanium crystal , improving the sensitivity by the increase in @xmath51 : a factor of 2.3 .",
    "this may lead to a 0.3% measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath13 , more than a factor of five improvement .",
    "we note that this method is related to the experiment of shull which first demonstrated pendellsung interference fringes in neutron dynamical diffraction @xcite .",
    "the structure factor @xmath35 was precisely determined from the fringe separation and @xmath52 was obtained for the ( 111 ) reflection in silicon via equation [ e : onb ] .",
    "the main advantages of our approach are ( 1 ) an improved overall precision due to the interferometric measurement of the neutron phase and ( 2 ) the ability to make a relative subraction of @xmath20 from equation [ e : onb ] _ in situ_.      r.  g.  sachs , phys .",
