    "universal scaling laws for the dimensional properties of flexible polymer chain in a good solvent , such as the end - to - end distance @xmath4 and the gyration radius @xmath5 , are well explained and understood since the groundbreaking studies by de gennes and des cloizeaux @xcite .",
    "it was found that both properties scale as @xmath6 for large enough numbers of monomers @xmath1 , where the exponent @xmath3 is universal and depends on the dimension of space @xmath7 only . besides that",
    ", the probability distribution @xmath8 is also examined in both asymoptotic regimes of small and large values of @xmath4 based on the number of chain conformations @xcite .",
    "similar arguments allowed lhuillier to suggest an heuristic form for the probability distribution @xmath9 as well @xcite .",
    "as far as the scaling laws are also valid for a number of other characteristics of the polymer chain , the universality and scaling properties are often treated as identical concepts .",
    "this , however , is a misconception as far as there exist characteristics that are universal but do not obey scaling laws .",
    "an example is given by the shape characteristics of polymer chains that which is in the focus of this paper .",
    "these are important in a number of applications , to mention here various catalytic activities @xcite and gel chromatography @xcite .    the fact that the shape of a polymer coil in a good solvent is not spherical",
    "is known since a classical work by kuhn @xcite .",
    "however , the understanding that certain shape properties of polymer chains are universal and depend , like scaling parameters , solely on @xmath7 , is brought _ via _ the use of the renormalization group method ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these findings were also supported by a number of numerical simulations performed on lattice models of the self avoiding walk ( saw ) @xcite .",
    "one should note that the mean values for most shape characteristics are different but nonetheless close to their random walk ( rw ) counterparts . some important implication here can be seen in the fact that the probability distributions for most of these characteristics are very broad and asymmetric yielding an ambiguity in the definition of their mean values .",
    "the shape of these distributions remains to be explained in a manner similar to the one given for their counterparts @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9@xcite .",
    "most of the simulation studies mentioned above use the monte carlo algorithm applied to the saw lattice model .",
    "this approach achieves very good configuration statistics by means of relatively low computation cost .",
    "atomistic off - lattice models , on the other hand , allow one to include the effects of chain stiffness , chain composition , the role of solvent , etc . in a chemical way , but at an increased simulation time cost .",
    "a good compromise here is the use of coarse - grained approaches that combine the best of two worlds : chemical versatility and computational efficiency .",
    "one of such approaches is the dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) method @xcite , that has already been used by a number of authors @xcite including two of the current authors @xcite , to examine the scaling properties of a polymer chain in a solvent of variable quality .",
    "the benefit of this approach is that it provides the means to study a number of important problems related to microphase separation of amphi- and polyphilic molecules , self - assembly , adsorption , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "macromolecular shape plays an important role in all of the above mentioned problems .",
    "therefore , the validation of this approach with respect to its reliability in predicting the correct macromolecular shape is of high practical interest .",
    "this is exactly at the heart of the current study , were we apply dpd simulations to the simplest case  a single chain in a good solvent .",
    "we examine the asphericity , prolateness and a number of the other shape characteristics , as well as their probability distributions . besides the mean values for each of these properties",
    ", we also evaluate their most probable values by means of fitting their probability distributions to respective analytic expressions .",
    "the outline of the study is as follows .",
    "the simulation approach and the properties of interest are described in sec .",
    "[ ii ] , scaling properties and a probability distributions analysis are covered in sec .",
    "[ iii ] , probability distributions for shape characteristics are discussed in sec .",
    "[ iv ] and conclusions are provided in sec .",
    "our study is based on mesoscopic dpd simulations , which has two main advantages : ( i ) neglecting less important properties of a system on small length- and time - scales , and ( ii ) preserving hydrodynamic limits @xcite .",
    "a single polymer chain and an explicit solvent are contained within a cubic simulation box with a linear size of at least @xmath10 . here , @xmath11 is the estimate for the gyration radius of a chain of @xmath1 monomers in a good solvent : @xmath12^{0.59}$ ] ( @xmath13 is an estimate for an average bond length as reported in @xcite ) .",
    "the monomers are soft beads of equal size , and each one represents either a fragment of a real polymer chain or a few molecules of a solvent .",
    "we restrict our study to the case of an athermal solvent , where all types of pairwise bead - bead interactions : polymer - polymer , solvent - solvent and polymer - solvent are identical .",
    "the monomer coordinates @xmath14 are defined in continuous space ( in contrary to most studies using the monte carlo method for similar studies , which , typically , are performed on a lattice ) .",
    "this allows to describe the phase space of conformations by chains of shorter length . on the other hand",
    ", the soft nature of dpd interaction prevents the system from being caught in a metastable state ( what is often observed in the case of the molecular dynamics when atomistic potentials are applied ) .",
    "we follow the dpd approach as described in ref .",
    "the length is represented in units of the diameter of the soft bead , and the energy scale is assumed to be @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath17 is the temperature and time is expressed in @xmath18 .",
    "the monomers are connected _ via _ harmonic springs , which results in a force @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the spring constant .",
    "the non - bonded forces contain three contributions @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the conservative force , resulting from the repulsion between @xmath24-th and @xmath25-th soft beads , @xmath26 is the dissipative force , that occurs due to the friction between soft beads , and random force @xmath27 that works in pair with a dissipative force to thermostat the system .",
    "the expressions for all these three contributions are given below @xcite",
    "@xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the velocity of @xmath24th bead , @xmath34 is the amplitude for the conservative repulsive force .",
    "the dissipative force has an amplitude @xmath35 and decays with the distance according to the weight function @xmath36 .",

    "the system is soft repulsive and is kept together by an external pressure to provide the required density , which corresponds to a liquid state . in these simulations the following numeric values are used : @xmath43 for all pairs of interacting beads , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and the time - step @xmath46 .",
    "the duration of all runs ( each performed for a different chain length @xmath47 ) was fixed at @xmath48 dpd steps .    here and",
    "thereafter we consider the case of space dimension @xmath49 only .",

    "one of the aims was to check the universality of the properties not directly connected to the scaling power laws . in this respect",
    "we here evaluated the shape characteristics which can be seen as counterparts of the universal critical amplitude ratios in critical phenomena .",
    "as far as the simulations employ an off - lattice model for the polymer chain and an explicit solvent , these are more computationally intensive than their lattice monte carlo counterparts and can not match the latter in numerical accuracy .",
    "however , using this simulation technique , one bridges the gap to a large number of studies targeted on at self - assembly of various amphi- and polyphilic systems and to the flow - driven phenomena on the nanoscale .",
    "hence , according to our aim , we rather focus on a qualitative analysis of the mean and most probable values for the shape characteristics , as well as on the form of their probability distributions . therefore",
    ", no rigorous analysis of the numerical errors was performed and these are not displayed in the figures or in the table of results .",
    "the origin our analysis is a study of the scaling properties of the gyration tensor components .",
    "we find that , for chain lengths @xmath236 , not only the end - to - end distance and gyration radius , but also all three eigenvalues of the gyration tensor scale with the same power law .",
    "the flory exponent @xmath3 obtained for each of these properties independently , within the accuracy of the simulations , is close to the best theoretical estimate @xmath102 .",
    "based on the analytic expressions , the shape characteristics of the chain are expected to be independent of @xmath1 in the same interval of chain lengths .",
    "this has been checked by plotting each of them against @xmath1 .",
    "the mean values for the shape characteristics were evaluated by averaging their respective values obtained for chain lengths of @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "the mean values for the asphericity and prolateness are found to compare well with the respective results obtained by means of other approaches , whereas the shape anisotropy requires simulations of longer chains .",
    "the averaging procedure for these properties , however , is found to be rather ambiguous , as the probability distributions for all shape characteristics are wide and many are highly asymmetric .",
    "therefore , alongside with the mean values , one may consider looking at the most probable values of each characteristic as well .",
    "this can be performed by fitting the probability distribution for each characteristic by certain analytic expressions and determining the most probable value based on the positions of its maxima .    here , we started from the analysis of the probability distributions for the reduced end - to - end distance and the gyration radius .",
    "for the former case , the known analytic asymptotics of cloiseaux - de gennes were reproduced , whereas for the latter the lhuillier analytic expression is found to be very accurate yielding another independent estimate for the flory exponent @xmath3 .",
    "the analytic expressions in both cases are based on an analysis of the conformation statistics , which is more difficult to apply to the shape characteristics . for the latter ,",
    "we suggest heuristic analytic expressions based on the lhuillier form and , for the symmetric distributions , on a generalised gaussian distribution .",
    "this leads to simple analytical expressions with the coefficients and exponents found from fitting the simulation data .",
    "this allows us to complement the mean values for the shape properties by their most probable values found as the maximal positions of the respective distributions .",
    "the study can be interpreted as yet another validation on the appropriateness of the use of soft coarse - grained potentials to describe the self - avoiding polymer chain .",
    "not only the scaling properties of the end - to - end distance and gyration radius of such chains are in good agreement with the theoretical data , but also the mean values of the shape characteristics and their probability distributions are found to closely mimic the results of more accurate lattice monte carlo simulations .",
