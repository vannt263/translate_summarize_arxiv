    "is considered an almost ideal heisenberg ferromagnet with a curie temperature of @xmath7 k and a zero - temperature moment of @xmath8  @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the latter indicates an induced polarization of the conduction bands of at least 0.63 @xmath1 due to an interband exchange coupling between itinerant band electrons and localized 4f electrons .",
    "the rather strict localization of the 4f wave function@xcite prevents a sufficient overlap for a direct exchange interaction between the 4f moments .",
    "the coupling between the moments is therefore mediated by polarized 5d/6s conduction electrons ( rkky ) , i.e. strongly influenced by the electronic structure .",
    "although the ferromagnetic ground - state of gd is of course without any doubt , it is still a matter of debate how to get this fact by an `` _ _ ab initio _ _ '' band structure calculation .",
    "numerous investigations of the electronic ground - state properties of gd have been performed in the recent past @xcite , all in the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) .",

    "a standard local density approach ( lda ) to dft predicts an antiferromagnetic ground state if the 4f electrons are considered as valence electrons . in a detailed analysis kurz et al .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the reason for the incorrect prediction of antiferromagnetism is the wellknown difficulty of lda correctly to describe strongly localized electrons .",
    "the lda calculation of ref .",
    "poses the nearly dispersionsless majority 4f bands some 4.5 ev below the fermi energy while the minority 4f bands are directly above the fermi energy leading to a certain itinerancy of the 4f electrons .",
    "these findings are at variance with the results of combined direct ( xps ) and inverse ( bis ) photoemission experiments@xcite which observe occupied 4f  @xmath10-states at the binding energy ( @xmath11 ) ev and unoccupied 4f  @xmath12-states at ( @xmath13 ) ev , i.  e. distinctly away from the fermi edge .",
    "a special consequence of the wrong position of the down spin 4f states is an extremely high density of states close to the fermi edge and therewith an unrealistically big @xmath14-value of the electronic heat capacity@xcite . the most important consequence of the wrong 4f  @xmath12-position , however , is the prediction of antiferromagnetism .",
    "all calculations , which treat the 4f electrons as valence electrons , irrespective of whether the lda or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) is applied , end up with an antiferromagnetic gd - ground - state@xcite .",
    "today it is clear how to remove this inadequacy of lda ( gga ) `` _ _ by hand__''@xcite .",
    "one has to remove the 4f  @xmath12-states from the fermi energy .",
    "this can be done simply by considering the 4f states as `` _ _ core states _ _ '' , so that they are not allowed to hybridize with any other states on neighbouring atoms@xcite .",
    "another way is to apply the so - called lda@xmath15 method@xcite , which introduces strong intraatomic interactions of the localized states in a hartree - fock - like manner .",
    "the main effect is a splitting apart of the occupied and unoccupied 4f states@xcite , i.e. in particular a removal of the minority 4f states from the fermi edge .",

    "must be induced since the 5d/6s electrons can be considered as only weakly correlated and _ `` a priori '' _ non - magnetic .",
    "the splitting is obviously due to a strong interband exchange interaction between the flat 4f states and the extended 5d/6s conduction states .",
    "precondition for that is a ferromagnetic order of the localized magnetic moments built by the half - filled 4f shells .",
    "the next neighbour distance is too large for a direct exchange interaction .",

    "the ferromagnetism of gd does therefore mean first of all to understand its electronic structure .",
    "the induced 5d/6s exchange splitting is still a matter of controversial debate , in particular what concerns its temperature dependence@xcite .",
    "is it collapsing or non - collapsing for @xmath19 ?",
    "photoemission data appear to be not unique .",
    "some experiments point to a collapsing ( `` _ _ stoner - like _ _ '' ) behavior@xcite , others exhibit a splitting that does not shift very much with temperature ( `` _ _ spin - mixing _ _ '' ) persisting in the paramagnetic phase@xcite . in the latter case",
    "the demagnetization for @xmath19 is reached by a redistribution of spectral weight rather than by a gradually increasing overlap of respective spin peaks . to find out what is really going on one",
    "needs a theory for the full temperature - dependence of the electronic structure .",
    "pure `` _ _ ab initio _ _ '' band calculations are restricted to @xmath0 being therefore insufficient for this purpose .",

    "a key - quantity of ferromagnetism is the curie temperature @xmath20 .",
    "it is the aim of each theory for a ferromagnetic material to approach @xmath20 as quantitatively as possible . on the other hand ,",
    "it is a very sensitive term to get .",
    "several attempts have been started to estimate @xmath20 from total - energy calculations by use of the lda - dft scheme@xcite .",
    "for this purpose the energy data are inserted into simple mean - field formula for the magnetic transition temperature , very often arriving at astonishingly accurate @xmath20-values .",
    "however , it is surely not unfair to state that such estimates can not replace a full theory of the gd ferromagnetism .",
    "the latter requires access to an electronic structure calculation which fully accounts for decisive temperature and correlations effects . to our information",
    "such a complete theory does not yet exist for the prototype local - moment ferromagnet gd .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to present a methodical approach to the temperature - dependent electronic structure of ferromagnetic local - moment metals with a direct application to gd .",
    "we present a theory of the electronic quasiparticle structure of the ferromagnetic 4f metal gd that yields in a self - consistent manner the electronic as well as the magnetic properties .",
    "the approach shall work for arbitrary temperatures regarding in particular electron correlations effects .",
    "to get in this sense a realistic picture of gd we combine a `` _ _ first principles _ _ '' band structure calculation with a many - body evaluation of a properly chosen theoretical model similar to previous work on the band ferromagnets fe , co , and ni@xcite .",
    "we consider the underlying proposal a continuation and extension of a previously pubished paper@xcite that already dealt with the electronic quasiparticle structure of gd .",
    "however , in the previous case we did not succeed in getting the ferromagnetism self - consistently , i.e. simply via the special electronic structure . there appeared a serious ambiguity how to handle the d - band degeneracy , i.e. how to perform the necessary decomposition of 5d - band in non - degenerate subbands . the decomposition in ref .",
    "did not emphasize the correct symmetry of atomic orbitals .",
    "separate model calculations @xcite revealed that the then - used d - band decomposition is inconvenient for a ferromagnetic order of the local 4f moments .",
    "we propose in this paper a new ansatz by which one gets correctly the electronic structure as well as the magnetic order of gd .    the general procedure is briefly described in the next section .",
    "central part of the procedure is a many - body evaluation of a properly chosen theoretical model . in section [ sec : tmodel ]",
    "we introduce and justify the ( multiband ) kondo - lattice model ( klm ) as a good starting point for an at least qualitative understanding of local - moment ferromagnets such as gd .",
    "we explain how to combine it with an lda - dft band calculation to come to quantitative statements .",
    "the klm provokes a non - trivial many - body problem which for the general case can not be treated rigorously . in section [ sec : mbeval ] our theoretical approach is represented . in the last step ( section  [ sec : megd ] ) we combine the model analysis with a band structure calculation to get the electronic quasiparticle spectrum of gd and its temperature dependence , that , on the other hand , fixes the magnetic properties of the rare earth metal as , e.g. , the curie temperature and the magnetic moment .",
    "our study aims at a quantitative determination of the temperature - dependent electronic structure of the 4f - ferromagnet gd .",
    "the general concept is rather straightforward and consists of three steps .",
    "the important first step is the choice of a suitable theoretical model .",
    "the main physics is due to the existence and the mutual influence of two well defined subsystems , quasi - free electrons in rather broad conductions bands ( 5d/6s ) and localized electrons with extremely flat dispersions ( 4f ) .",
    "the theoretical model is defined by its hamiltonian ; @xmath21 more strictly , by its interaction part @xmath22 .",
    "this particular operator shall incorporate all those interactions which are responsible for the characteristic phenomena under study . in the present case @xmath22",
    "should cover the decisive electron correlations which determine the magnetic properties and the characteristic temperature dependence of the electron quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "our proposal for @xmath22 is discussed in the next section .    while there is no contribution of the f electrons to the kinetic energy ,",
    "the part of the band electrons reads : @xmath23 @xmath24 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a wannier electron at site @xmath25 in the orbital @xmath26 with spin @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "@xmath29 is the respective fourier transform @xmath30 @xmath31 the hopping process from site @xmath25 to site @xmath32 may be accompanied by an orbital change ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "@xmath34 are the respective hopping integrals : @xmath35 @xmath36 is the chemical potential .",
    "the single - particle part @xmath37 of the model - hamiltonian @xmath38 stands , as usually , for the kinetic energy of the itinerant charge carriers and for their interaction with the lattice potential .",
    "however , it shall furthermore account for all those interactions which are not directly covered by @xmath22 . by construction",
    "these interactions are not important for the magnetic properties and the temperature - dependence of the electronic spectrum of the underlying ferromagnetic material ( gd ) .",
    "nevertheless they may influence the rough structure of the spectrum so that they can not be neglected if our study really aims at a quantitative description of gd .",
    "for this reason we perform in the second step of our procedure a full selfconsistent band structure calculation within the lda - dft scheme in order to replace the single - particle energies @xmath39 in @xmath37 by the effective energies of the lda : @xmath40    since the _",
    "`` other '' _ interactions are , by construction of the model , not responsible for the temperature effects , we can incorporate them for any temperature , e.g. for @xmath0 where lda works .",
    "it is therefore guaranteed that all the other interactions are well accounted by the single particle energy renormalization ( [ eq : hoppingren ] ) .",
    "however , the problem of a double counting of just the relevant interactions , namely once explicitely in @xmath22 and then once more implicitely in @xmath37 , must carefully be avoided .",
    "how we circumvent this problem in the case of the local - moment ferromagnet gd is explained at a later stage .    in the third step",
    "we apply a many - body formalism in order to investigate how the effective single - particle energies change under the influence of the _ `` relevant '' _ interaction @xmath22 into temperature - , carrier concentration ( @xmath41 ) - and possibly spin - dependent quasiparticle energies : @xmath42 the quasiparticle energies are derived as the poles of the single - electron green - function matrix : @xmath43^{-1}\\ ] ] @xmath44 is the selfenergy matrix , the determination of which solves the problem .",
    "@xmath45 is the hopping - matrix .",

    "the spectral density expresses the bare line shape of an angle- and spin - resolved ( direct or inverse ) photoemission spectrum : @xmath50 an additional @xmath51-summation yields the quasiparticle density of states ( angle - averaged photoemission spectrum ! ) @xmath52 that in general will be temperature - , carrier concentration - , lattice structure - , and in particular for ferromagnetic systems , explicitely spin - dependent .",
    "we still have to fix the interaction part @xmath53 of the model hamiltonian ( [ eq : thmodel ] ) for the correlated system of localized ( 4f ) and delocalized ( 5d ) electrons .",
    "we presume from the very beginning an on - site coulomb interaction between electrons of different subbands , @xmath54 for simplicity we drop for the moment the site index @xmath55 and the respective summation , that will be reintroduced at the end of the following consideration . @xmath56 denote the different bands , and @xmath57 are the coulomb matrix elements . restricting the electron scattering processes caused by the coulomb interaction to two involved subbands , only , we get instead of ( [ eq : h1 ] ) : @xmath58 in the case of gd the band indices @xmath59 and",
    "@xmath60 can be attributed either to a flat 4f band ( @xmath61 ) or to a broad ( 5d/6s ) conduction band ( @xmath62 ) . in an obvious manner we can then split the coulomb interaction into three different parts , @xmath63 depending on wether both interacting particles stem from a conduction band , @xmath64 , or both from a flat band @xmath65 , or one from a flat band the other from a conduction band , @xmath66 .",
    "the first term , @xmath64 , refers to electron correlations in the broad conduction bands .",
    "we consider them not to be decisive for the characteristic gd - physics .",
    "according to our concept ( section [ sec : gprocedure ] ) @xmath64 does not enter explicitely our model being rather accounted for by the single - particle energy renormalization ( [ eq : hoppingren ] ) .",
    "@xmath65 is built by pure 4f correlations .",
    "the main influence of the 4f electrons on the gd - physics is due to the fact that they form permanent localized magnetic moments .",
    "so @xmath65 is unimportant as part of our model - hamiltonian and we are left with the interaction between localized and itinerant electrons : @xmath67 the last two terms do not contribute since the gd@xmath68 - 4f shell has its maximum spin @xmath69 .",
    "all the seven 4f electrons have to occupy different subbands and none of the seven subbands will be doubly occupied . by use of the electron spin operator , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) we get @xmath66 in the following compact form @xmath72 with @xmath73 . for all processes of interest",
    "the number of f electrons per site is fixed , @xmath74 is therefore only a @xmath75-number",
    ". the last term in ( [ eq : hdffinal ] ) does not really provide an fd - interaction .",
    "it leads only to a rigid shift of the atomic levels being therefore fully accounted for by the renormalization ( [ eq : hoppingren ] ) of the single - particle part of the hamiltonian . by defining the spin operator @xmath76 of the local f moment @xmath77 and by assuming that the interband exchange @xmath78 is independent of the special index - pair @xmath79 @xmath80 the interaction term reads after the reintroduction of the lattice site dependence :",

    "the first term of ( [ eq : hsf ] ) describes an ising - like interaction of the two spin operators , while the other provides spin exchange processes between localized moment and itinerant electron .",
    "spin exchange may happen by three different elementary processes : magnon emission by an itinerant @xmath12-electron , magnon absorption by a @xmath10-electron and also formation of a quasiparticle , which is called _",

    "`` multiband kondo - lattice model '' _ ( m - klm ) .",
    "while in the interaction part @xmath66 the multiband aspect appears only as an additional summation , the subbands are intercorrelated via the single - particle term @xmath37 .",
    "an important model parameter is of course the effective coupling constant @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the width of the _ `` free '' _ bloch - band and @xmath86 the local spin value .",

    "other model parameters are the lattice structure and the band occupation @xmath87 in case of an s - band @xmath41 is a number in between 0 and 2 .      the many - body problem provoked by the model hamiltonian ( [ eq : h",
    "] ) is rather sophisticated , up to now not exactly solvable for the general case .",
    "fortunately , however , there exists a non - trivial , very illustrative limiting case which is rigorously tractable , nevertheless exhibiting all the above mentioned elementary excitations processes@xcite .",
    "it refers to a single electron in an otherwise empty conduction band being coupled to a ferromagnetically saturated moment system .",
    "such a situation is met , e.g. , for the ferromagnetic semiconductor euo at @xmath0 . because of the empty band and the totally aligned spin system the hierarchy of equation of motions of the single - electron green function ( [ eq : gf ] , [ eq : gfelements ] ) decouples exactly .",

    "only the ising - type interaction in ( [ eq : hsf ] ) takes care for a rigid shift of the selfenergy by @xmath91",
    ". the spectral densities ( [ eq : skm ] ) are @xmath92-functions representing quasiparticles with infinite lifetimes .",
    "real correlation effects appear , however , in the @xmath12 spectrum .",

    "[ fig : polaron ] shows the energy dependence of the @xmath12-spectral density @xmath93 for some symmetry points .",
    "furthermore , we have chosen a sc lattice , @xmath94 and @xmath95 ev .    for weak coupling",
    "( e.g. @xmath96 ev ) the spectral density consists of a single pronounced peak .",
    "the finite width points to a finite quasiparticle lifetime due to some spin flip processes , but the sharpness of the peaks indicates a long living quasiparticle .",
    "this changes drastically even for rather moderate effective exchange couplings @xmath84 .",
    "one observes in certain parts of the brillouin zone , for strongly coupled systems even in the whole brillouin zone , that the spectral density splits into two parts .",
    "the sharp high - energy peak belongs to the formation of the magnetic polaron while the broad low - energy part consists of scattering states due to magnon emission by the @xmath12 electron .",
    "as long as the polaron peak is above the scattering spectrum the quasiparticle has even an infinite lifetime .",
    "the scattering spectrum is in general rather broad because the emitted magnon can carry away any wave - vector from the first brillouin zone . because of the concomitant spinflip magnon emission can happen only if there are @xmath10 states within reach",
    "therefore , the scattering part extends just over that energy region where @xmath97 .",
    "sometimes , as e.g. for @xmath98 ev at the @xmath99 point ( fig .  [ fig : polaron ] ) , the scattering part is surprisingly bunched together to a prominent peak , therefore certainly visible in a respective ( inverse ) photoemission experiment . note that the results in fig .",

    "the main problem , when using lda - dft results as renormalized single - particle input , is to avoid a double counting of just the decisive interband exchange coupling , namely once explicitely in the interaction - part @xmath22 of the model - hamiltonian and then once more implicitely by the effective single - particle input .",
    "the exact limiting case of the last section gives the hint how to circumvent this double - counting problem .",

    "as mentioned , model approaches convincingly demonstrate that this remains true for finite band occupation ( less than half - filled bands ! ) , too , at least to a very good approximation . for less than half - filled bands",
    "we therefore can identify the ( @xmath0 , @xmath102)-lda results ( without the 4f part ) with the free bloch energies . by this procedure",
