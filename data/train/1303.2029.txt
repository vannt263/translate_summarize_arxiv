    "( [ mbv ] ) the velocity component in the @xmath39 direction has a distribution only at @xmath40,@xcite assuming the @xmath39 axis to be the surface normal direction .",
    "given the desorption period is much shorter than the flight time and the irradiation diameter is much smaller than the flight distance , eq .",
    "( [ mbv ] ) can be , as a velocity distribution in a flux from a thermal source , transformed to the same form as eq .",
    "( [ mb ] ) .",

    "we discuss that the desorption flow is described as an intense flow , where the post - desorption collision modifies the velocity distribution.@xcite several theoretical studies have speculated that the so - called knudsen layer is formed in the vicinity of the surface as a result of collisions.@xcite as schematically drawn in fig .",
    "[ kl ] , in the knudsen layer model , the initial velocity distribution is in thermal equilibrium with the surface at @xmath10 except that there is no distribution at @xmath44 as in eq .",

    "the half - range velocity distribution at @xmath45 becomes thermally equilibrated at some distance from the surface to a full - range maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution with a stream velocity @xmath6.@xcite the model also requires that , at the end of the knudsen layer , the temperature of the flow becomes identical ( @xmath11 ) in all degrees of freedom .",
