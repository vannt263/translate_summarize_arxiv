[ data ] ) at a slightly higher flux of f@xmath41  erg  @xmath5  s@xmath7  corresponding to luminosities of l@xmath42  erg  s@xmath7 , and eddington ratios of @xmath43 , therefore , although detected , it has still been caught in the quiescent state .    the observed high column density of neutral material ( @xmath44  @xmath5 ) suggests that   is located at or behind the galactic center ( see section [ nhs ] ) .",

    "the x - ray spectra of ns - lmxbs in outburst ( see lin et al . 2007 ; barret et al .",

    "furthermore , the observed spectrum of  is significantly modified by absorption from a high column density of neutral material ( consistent with observations of other galactic center sources ) .    to determine the state of  in outburst , we investigated two independent measures : the x - ray variability and the shape of the x - ray continuum .",
    "we fitted the spectrum from each  obsid with three different continuum models ( all absorbed by a column density of neutral material fitted with the ` phabs ` model with anders & grevesse 1989 abundances and balucinska - church & mccammon 1998 cross sections ) .",

    "we find that for each of the observations where  has a high flux , the thermal ( blackbody and disc blackbody ) models give a significantly better fit compared to the power - law model .",
    "the power - law model is preferred in the two observations at the lowest flux . at the highest fluxes",
    "the best - fitting power - law spectral index indeed assumes very steep values ( @xmath54 ) suggesting instead the presence of a thermal component . despite the blackbody and disc blackbody models well reproducing the shape of the continuum of the high flux observations ,",
    "the presence of very significant residuals in the fe  k band make the fit formally unacceptable ( see tab . [ fit ] ) .",

    "note that the observed hardness - ratio indicates a real variation of the sed ( e.g. it is not due to a variation of the neutral absorber ; see section [ nhs ] ) .",
    "we therefore denote the thermal emission softer observations as ` soft state ' , and the power - law dominated harder observations as ` hard state ' .",
    "in what follows ( guided by the results presented in section [ state ] ) , we consider only an absorbed power - law spectral model for the hard state observations , and either an absorbed disc blackbody or an absorbed single blackbody component for the soft state observations ( see tab .

    "given the high - inclination of the system , it is probable that the intrinsic disc luminosity is much higher .",
    "for example , simple geometrical considerations ( not taking into account relativistic effects ) suggest that for s inclination angle of @xmath59 , the intrinsic disc luminosity should be a factor of @xmath60 higher than the observed luminosity by maeda et al .",
