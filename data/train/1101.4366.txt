    "one of the principal features distinguishing classical from quantum many - body systems is that quantum systems require exponentially many parameters in the system size to fully specify the state , compared to only linearly many for classical systems .",
    "put to use constructively , the exponential complexity enables the construction of information processing devices fundamentally superior to any classical device . at the same time",
    ", however , this `` curse of dimensionality '' makes engineering tasks  such as verifying that the quantum processing device functions as intended  a daunting challenge .",
    "the full determination of the quantum state of a system , known as quantum state tomography @xcite , has already been achieved by measuring a complete set of observables whose expectation values determine the quantum state @xcite .",
    "as it is typically formulated @xcite , simply to output an estimate for a generic state would take exponential time in the system size @xmath1 , given that there are an exponential number of coefficients in a generic state s description .",
    "this is but one of several inefficiencies .",
    "most quantum states have exponentially small amplitudes in almost every basis , so to distinguish any one of those amplitudes from zero , one must take an exponential number of samples .",
    "assuming one were able to collect all the data from an informationally complete measurement , one is left with the intractable computational task of inverting the measured frequencies to find an estimate of the state .",
    "however , the traditional representation of quantum states is in a sense too general .",
    "indeed , states which occur in many practical situations are specified by a small number of parameters .",
    "an efficient description could be a practical preparation scheme which outputs the state ; or , in the case of thermodynamical equilibrium states , a local hamiltonian and a temperature .",
    "this insight is not new : researchers in many - body physics and quantum information theory have found many classes of states which are described by a number of parameters scaling polynomially in @xmath1 @xcite and which closely approximate the kind of states found in physical systems @xcite .",
    "however , the question of whether these restricted classes can be put to use in the context of tomography has remained largely open .    in this work ,",
    "we address the above challenge .",
    "the physical system we have in mind is one where the constituents are arranged in a one - dimensional configuration ( e.g. , ions in a linear trap @xcite ) .",
    "but the methods that we are presenting here can be generalized to higher - dimensional arrangements such as those realized in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "it is highly plausible that in such a setting , correlations between neighboring particles are much more pronounced ( due to direct interaction ) than correlations between distant systems ( mediated e.g.by global fluctuations of control fields ) . an efficiently describable class of states anticipating exactly this behavior has long been studied under the names of finitely correlated states ( fcs ) or matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite .",
    "importantly , restricting to this class is not a limitation since _ every _ state may be written as a mps with a suitable , albeit possibly large , matrix dimension .",
    "since many states that are relevant for quantum information processing or quantum many - body physics have a small ( independent of @xmath1 ) bond dimension , our methods are directly applicable to such states ; examples include , but are not limited to , ground and thermal states , the ghz , w , cluster , and aklt states , the latter two being universal resources states for quantum computing .",
    "given that standard tomography is no longer feasible in a range of recent and upcoming experiments involving large numbers of qubits , our results represent a significant advance in the ability to verify and quantitatively and efficiently benchmark systems of experimental importance .",
    "in the following we present two schemes for identifying systems that are well approximated by an mps , initially focusing on pure states for simplicity . we will view each system as consisting of a linear chain of @xmath1 qudits , each having dimension @xmath2 .",
    "both schemes require the measurement of linearly ( in the system size @xmath1 ) many local observables within finite accuracy , polynomial classical post - processing of the data and can certify the accuracy of the reconstructed state without making any technical assumptions about the state in the laboratory .",
    "the first scheme requires unitary control and local measurements while the second scheme removes the need for unitary control at the cost of more elaborate post - processing .",
    "the key idea of the method consists of a sequential procedure to _ disentangle _ the left hand side of the chain from the right hand side , using a sequence of unitary operations with small interaction length independent of @xmath1 .",
    "the result will be a product state and a sequence of local unitary operations from which to construct the original state .",
    "suppose the ideal state in the laboratory is @xmath3 , which we assume for clarity is a mps of given bond dimension .",
    "this implies that the rank of reductions to one part of a bipartite ( left vs.  right ) split of the chain is bounded by a constant @xmath4 .",
    "the protocol starts by estimating , through standard state tomography , the reduced density matrix of the first @xmath5 sites , @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "this reduced density matrix has the eigendecomposition @xmath7 where the rank @xmath8 .",
    "hence there exists a density matrix with one fewer qudit that has the same rank @xmath4 and eigenvalues @xmath9 as @xmath10 .",
    "therefore we can disentangle the first site in @xmath10 with the following unitary acting on the first @xmath11 sites : @xmath12 where @xmath13 have been extended in some arbitrary way to get a complete basis for sites @xmath14 .",
    "applying @xmath15 produces the state @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is some pure state on sites @xmath18 .",
    "hence @xmath15 disentangles the first qudit from all the others .",
    "now , set aside this first qudit , look at sites @xmath19 , and repeat the above process as indicated on fig .  [ fig_circuit ] . in this way",
    ", one obtains a sequence of unitaries @xmath20 , where each @xmath21 acts on sites @xmath22 .",
    "this sequence transforms @xmath23 into @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is some pure state on the last @xmath26 sites .",
    "quantum circuit that transforms @xmath27 into @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the unitaries @xmath21 successively disentangle the particles and the state @xmath30 on the last sites acts as a boundary condition to determine the mps description of @xmath27 . ]    in summary , this scheme infers the quantum circuit used to prepare an mps @xcite . the mps decomposition of @xmath23 can then be obtained readily from the @xmath31 and @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "if the state in the laboratory @xmath32 is arbitrary , then the reduced density matrices @xmath10 will generally have full rank .",
    "hence in each step we will need to truncate the @xmath11 qudit state @xmath10 to a rank @xmath4 subspace with @xmath33 .",
    "then the above method will produce an mps approximation to @xmath32 .",
    "the accuracy of this estimate can be certified , without any assumptions on the state , by keeping track of the effects of truncating each of the reduced states @xmath10 . as shown in the methods , errors of magnitude @xmath34 due to finite measurement precision or truncation error ( as measured by the weight of the truncated space ) accumulate at most linearly with the number of sites , and can be evaluated directly from the data , leading to an estimate of accuracy @xmath35 .",
    "the present scheme requires unitary control of @xmath11 neighboring qudits , which is challenging to implement in many current experimental settings .",
    "we now present a second scheme that avoids unitary control and requires only local measurements .",
    "consider again the state @xmath32 in the laboratory and suppose that a tomographically - complete set of local measurements on all groups of @xmath36 neighbouring qubits has been performed .",
    "further suppose that sufficient data has been taken to yield estimates @xmath37 of the local reductions",
    "@xmath38 $ ] such that @xmath39 determining these approximate reduced density operators @xmath37 completes the experimental work . in the remainder",
    "we describe the classical post - processing that will result in a mps estimate @xmath40 to @xmath32 and a lower bound to the fidelity @xmath41 @xcite that does _ not _ require assumptions on the nature of the state @xmath32 .",
    "we start with the latter , since the following easy calculation yields the fidelity bound we have in mind and hints at the mps estimate we are after .",
    "suppose , for the sake of the argument , that @xmath40 is the unique ground state ( with energy zero ) of a local hamiltonian @xmath42 , where the @xmath43 is a projection operator acting only on sites @xmath44 ( as it turns out , generic mps are of this type ) .",

    "hence , we have the fidelity bound @xmath48}{\\delta e }      \\ge 1-\\frac1{\\delta e}\\big(\\sum_i\\text{tr}[\\hat{h}_i \\hat{\\sigma}_i ] + \\epsilon_i\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , the hamiltonian acts as a _ witness _ for its ground state @xmath40",

    "the goal is now clear : find a local gapped hamiltonian @xmath54 such that the reductions of its ground state are close to the @xmath37 .",
    "_ a priori _ it is unclear whether such a convenient witness always exists and how it could be found efficiently . however , using formal methods",
    ", one can show that if the true state @xmath55 is close to a generic mps , then such a witness hamiltonian always exists @xcite .",
    "what is more , it can be constructed from the estimate of the algorithm sketched below .",
    "its properties , chief among them the gap , are efficiently computable . in the methods section ,",
    "we detail the efficient computation of these quantities , and we also consider how to treat states such as the ghz for which local marginals alone are not quite sufficient for complete characterization ( they violate our `` generic '' condition ) .",
    "we illustrate how our certification procedure operates if our estimate for the state @xmath32 is a linear cluster state @xcite .",
    "the cluster state is defined as the unique eigenstate ( with eigenvalue @xmath56 ) of stabilizers @xmath57 for all @xmath58 ( together with boundary terms @xmath59 and @xmath60 , which we do not treat separately for simplicity ) .",
    "assume that we have performed standard quantum state tomography on sets of three neighbouring spins , @xmath61 , which is the smallest useful set because in a cluster state the rank of the reduced density matrices of contiguous blocks is upper bounded by @xmath62 .",
    "let us now assume that on the basis of these data , our procedure suggests that the linear cluster state is indeed our estimate .",
    "the local hamiltonian in this case is given by @xmath63 , where the @xmath64 are projectors , @xmath54 has the cluster state as its unique ground state ( with energy zero ) and an energy gap @xmath65 .",
    "the fidelity between the cluster state @xmath66 and the state @xmath32 is bounded by @xmath67 + \\epsilon_i)$ ] , where @xmath68 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : localerror ] ) quantifies the statistical and experimental error in the local experimental estimates , and @xmath69 $ ] quantifies how much the laboratory state @xmath32 deviates from an exact cluster state .",
    "tomography on a cluster state can also be performed with the scheme based on unitary transformations .",
    "a cluster state is the output of a quantum circuit where each qubit is initially prepared in the state @xmath70 and a controlled phase transformation @xmath71 acts successfully on each pair of neighboring qubits .",
    "the @xmath71 gate changes the sign of state @xmath72 and acts trivially on the other states of the computational basis .",
    "thus , a cluster state is the output of a circuit whose structure corresponds to the one indicated on fig .",
    "[ fig_circuit ] with @xmath73 and the scheme based on unitary transformations directly applies .",
    "note that the unitary scheme takes advantage of the decreased rank of a reduced density matrix on the _ boundary _ to save one qubit worth of local tomographic effort ( @xmath74 vs.  @xmath61 ) .      with the experimentally obtained @xmath37",
    ", we now turn to the task of finding an mps @xmath40 such that its reductions @xmath75 $ ] closely match the @xmath37 .",
    "in other words : let @xmath76 be all possible products of pauli operators ( enumerated by @xmath77 ) that act non - trivially only on sites @xmath44 . then",

    "the method of choice for such a problem is singular value thresholding ( svt ) @xcite , which has been developed very recently in the context of classical _ compressive sampling _ or _ matrix completion _ @xcite and may also be applied to the quantum setting @xcite .",
    "svt is a recursive algorithm that provably converges to a low - rank matrix satisfying constraints of the type @xmath84=\\text{tr}[\\hat{\\sigma}_i\\hat{p}_{m}^i ] $ ] .",
    "unfortunately , a straightforward application of svt requires time and memory that scale exponentially with the number of particles .",
    "however , a modification of the algorithm allows us to overcome this problem .",
    "given the measured values @xmath85 $ ] the algorithm may then be described as follows .",
    "first set up the operator @xmath86\\hat{p}_{m}^{i}/2^n$ ] and initialize @xmath87 to some arbitrary matrix ( e.g. , the zero matrix ) .",
    "then proceed recursively by finding the eigenstate @xmath88 with largest eigenvalue , @xmath89 , of @xmath90 and set @xmath91 so far , this algorithm still suffers from the fact that in every step the @xmath92 matrix @xmath90 needs to be diagonalized .",
