    "cross section measurements of @xmath2production at @xmath3 are interesting as a proof of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at both leading and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) . at the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "energies , all the three @xmath2production mechanisms ( flavor creation , gluon splitting and flavor excitation ) are achievable .    the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) experiment is a general purpose experiment  @xcite .",
    "the main detector components used in the analyses presented here are the silicon tracker and the muon system .",
    "the silicon tracker has pseudorapidity coverage up to @xmath4 and provides an impact parameter resolution of @xmath5 m . due to the 3.8  t magnetic field , the transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) resolution is @xmath7 for particles with transverse momentum below 100  gev .",
    "the muon system has a coverage up to @xmath8 .",
    "information from the calorimeters is used to fully reconstruct jets .",
    "the measurements presented in this paper use early cms data ( 2010 ) as the trigger paths used in the following analyses are quite loose ( low transverse muon or jet momentum ) . with the increase of the instantaneous luminosity and the validation of the standard model predictions at the lhc scale ,",
    "tighter triggers have started to be applied and @xmath0-quark production measurements with newer data are not available at low momenta .",
    "the paper presents three cross section analyses : @xmath2cross section using dimuons is presented in section  [ dimuonsec ] , the open beauty production using single muons is presented in section  [ ptrelsec ] and the @xmath0-jet inclusive cross section is presented in section  [ bjetsec ] . section  [ bbarsec ] describes a measurement of the angular correlations between the @xmath9 hadrons .",
    "this analysis is sensitive to the individual production mechanisms .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the cross section for @xmath2production with both @xmath0-quarks decaying into muons has been recently measured  @xcite by cms using @xmath11 of data .",
    "the flavor composition of the dimuon sample in data has been determined by using the muon transverse impact parameter with respect to primary vertex ( @xmath12 ) as a discriminating variable . both muons need to have the transverse momentum @xmath13  gev , pseudorapidity @xmath14 and to be associated to the same primary vertex .",
    "cuts on invariant mass of the dimuon pair , @xmath15 , remove backgrounds from the @xmath16 ( @xmath17  gev ) , the @xmath18 ( @xmath19  gev ) and charmonium resonances and sequential decays ( @xmath20  gev ) .",
    "single muon events in the simulation are classified as :    * * b * : if the muon comes from a @xmath0-quark ( either directly or with sequential decays ) * * c * : if the muon comes from a @xmath21-quark * * p * : muons from prompt tracks or fakes * * d * : meson decay in flight ( muon from light quarks ) .    the impact parameter distributions for the * b * , * c * and * d * categories have been computed from simulation",
    ". the distribution for the * p * category is extracted from data by looking at @xmath18 decays .",
    "2d dimuon templates for the muon impact parameter ( * bb * , * cc * , * pp * , * dd * ) and combinations ( * bd * , * bc * , * cd * ... ) are built from the 1d distributions of the impact parameter for each muon .",
    "the 2d symmetrized distributions are populated in the @xmath22 bin according to the weight : @xmath23 which takes into account the bin content @xmath24 and @xmath25 of the 1d distribution for the muon @xmath26 .",
    "2d templates for data are filled by choosing the first and second muon in random order .",

    "figure  [ 2d ] ( right ) shows the 1d projection of the 2d templates . only processes",
    "in which both muons come from the same sources are shown in the plot .",
    "a binned maximum likelihood fit using the 2d distributions is performed to the data in order to extract the * bb * fraction content .",
    "templates for both muons from the same source or each muon from different sources are used .",
    "the templates for the * bp * , * cp * and * pd * have been neglected as they can not be resolved in the fit and have a small contribution .",
    "constraints are applied to the binned likelihood fit to maintain the ratios * bc / bb * , * bd / bb * and * cd / cc * at the simulation predictions .",
    "figure  [ 2dresults ] shows the 1d projections of the 2d distributions for data and for all the templates after the fit .",
    "the fraction of * bb * obtained by the fit is 65% .",
    "the integrated production cross section in the kinematic region ( @xmath27 ) has been evaluated : @xmath28 the largest systematic uncertainty in the analysis is from trigger efficiency ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the result can be compared with the pythia 6.4  @xcite prediction : @xmath30 and the mc@nlo  @xcite one : @xmath31 where pdf stands for the parton distribution function .",
    "the central value of the measurement is between the central values for the pythia and mc@nlo predictions .",
    "data and mc@nlo agree within uncertainties .",
    "an early data analysis , performed with data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath32 , measures the inclusive beauty production using single muons  @xcite .",
    "signal events are discriminated using the muon transverse momentum relative to the jet direction @xmath33 , defined as : @xmath34 the @xmath33 distribution is harder in @xmath0-events than in background events , due to the larger mass of the @xmath0-quark .",
    "the background events are categorized as events in which the muon come from a @xmath21-quark or from a light quark ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the analysis requires the muon transverse momentum @xmath36  gev , pseudorapidity @xmath14 , transverse impact parameter @xmath37  mm and longitudinal impact parameter @xmath38  cm .",
