    ", such observations can reveal the behavior of various tracers of the ism under somewhat different environmental conditions from those typically sampled in the local galactic ism .",
    "differences in overall metallicity , specific elemental abundance ratios , dust - to - gas ratios , and radiation fields all can affect the structure and composition of interstellar clouds ( e.g. , wolfire et al . 1995 ; pak et al .",
    "1998 ) ; in combination , the overall effects can be somewhat unexpected and counter - intuitive .",
    "exploration of diverse environments , where those factors act in different combinations , thus can aid in disentangling the specific effects of each factor .",
    "it is particularly important to compare the behavior of the enigmatic diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) in a variety of environments with the corresponding behavior of known atomic and molecular constituents of the ism .",
    "such comparisons should aid both in identifying the carriers of the dibs and in calibrating the dibs as diagnostics of the physical conditions in the ism .",
    "some of the typically strongest dibs ( in the local galactic ism ) have therefore been measured toward a small number of stars in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ; vladilo et al .",

    "2011 ) ; the strengths of individual dibs ( e.g. , @xmath45780.5 ) may yield useful estimates for the color excess @xmath9 and the column density of atomic hydrogen @xmath6(h ) where those quantities can not be directly determined ( e.g. , herbig 1993 ; friedman et al .",

    "the discovery of sn 2014j in m82 ( fossey et al . 2014 ) provided an opportunity to obtain moderately high resolution , high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio spectra of a bright , nearby supernova at multiple epochs ( both before and after maximum apparent brightness )  enabling searches for weak interstellar features and for temporal variations in the absorption that might reveal changes in circumstellar material ( e.g. , patat et al .",
    "2007 ; simon et al . 2009 ; sternberg et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "as summarized by goobar et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , analyses of the early photometry and optical spectra suggest that sn 2014j is a type ia , significantly reddened by intervening interstellar material located primarily within m82 ; estimates of @xmath9 range from about 0.8 to 1.3 mag ( polshaw et al .",

    "unfortunately , type ia sne typically have very little uv flux below about 2600   ( e.g. , foley & kirshner 2011 ; foley et al .",
    "2014 ) , making uv spectra impractical to obtain ( particularly for appreciably reddened sne )  so that investigations of the intervening ism will have to depend largely on interpreting the species observable in the optical and infrared .    in this paper",

    "section 5 summarizes our results and conclusions .",
    "two companion papers focus on the abundances and kinematics of the observed atomic and molecular species ( ritchey et al .",

    ", in preparation ) .",
    "forty - seven 20-minute exposures of sn 2014j were obtained with arces on six nights ( 2014 january 27 , 30 ; february 08 , 11 , 22 ; march 04 ) ",
    "i.e. , both before and after the observed peak in v - band brightness of the sn around 2014 february 03 . with the currently installed echelle grating ,",
    "the spectra cover nearly the full optical range from about 3800 to 11000   at a resolution of about 31,500 ( slightly lower than with the previous grating ) .",
    "independent reductions of the individual raw spectral images , employing standard procedures for arces spectra ( e.g. , thorburn et al . 2003 ) , were performed by ar and jd .",
    "minor differences in the extracted spectra for any given individual exposure may be attributed to slight differences employed in removing cosmic ray events .",
    "the 513 individual spectra obtained on each night were corrected for telluric absorption features ( via observations of bright , lightly - reddened standard stars ) , shifted to a common velocity scale ( local standard of rest ) , and co - added to produce nightly sum spectra . because no significant changes were noted in the absorption - line profiles ( ritchey et al .",
    "2014b ) , a total sum of all 47 spectra was also constructed ( though only the 29 spectra from the first four nights were used below about 4500  , due to the significantly lower flux in the blue on the last two nights ) .",
    "spectral segments around the various interstellar absorption features of interest were normalized via low - order polynomial fits to adjacent continuum regions .",
    "the nightly sum spectra have s / n ratios of order 300400 ( per resolution element ) near 6000  , and of order 100 below 4000  , as determined from the scatter in the continuum fits .",
    "equivalent widths and apparent optical depth ( aod ) estimates for the total column densities of known atomic and molecular species and equivalent widths for the dibs were then measured from the normalized spectra by integration over the line profiles . where possible , separate values were measured for the absorption from our galaxy and from m82 , taking @xmath1 = 30 km  s@xmath2 as the dividing line .",
    "for the dibs , the ranges over which the equivalent widths were measured are consistent with those adopted by friedman et al .",
    "( 2011 ; see their figure 1 ) , with allowance for broadening of the features due to the complex component structure observed for the material in m82 .",
    "the uncertainties in the measured equivalent widths include contributions from photon noise , continuum placement , and the range in values found for different combinations of the two independently reduced sets of spectra .",
    "independent multi - component fits to the profiles of the atomic and molecular lines were performed , using the codes * ismod * ( ar ; see sheffer et al . 2008 ) and * fits6p * ( dw ; see welty et al .",
