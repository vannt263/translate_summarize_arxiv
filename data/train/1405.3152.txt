    "fe - based semiconductors like fesi , fesb@xmath5 and fega@xmath3 have attracted much attention in the past years due to their interesting physical properties .",
    "the hybridization of the transition metal @xmath6 orbitals with the main group metal @xmath7 orbitals opens up small band gaps of the order of 0.1ev for fesi,@xcite 0.03ev for fesb@xmath5@xcite and 0.47ev for fega@xmath3.@xcite unusual transport properties and their origins are strongly debated within the community for the past two decades .",
    "for example , no clear consensus has been reached on the origin of the extremely high seebeck coefficient of -45000@xmath2vk@xmath1 around 10k in fesb@xmath5 single crystals.@xcite until now the community is split between two main schools of thought , one favoring the presence of strong electron - electron correlations@xcite while the other proposes phonon - drag mechanism@xcite as the source for the colossal value of seebeck effect .",
    "herein , we present for the first time huge thermopower values in the order of -16000@xmath2vk@xmath1 below 20k for single crystals of fega@xmath3 . the experimental results are based on especially good quality single crystals whose chemical compositions have been carefully checked by x - ray powder diffraction and metallographic analysis . among the various reasons that can rationalize such a large seebeck coefficient , the main candidates are ( i ) the presence of strong electronic correlations , ( ii ) structural phase transitions , ( iii ) magnetic phase transitions , and ( iv ) the interaction of the phonons with the mobile charge carriers via the phonon - drag effect .",
    "for example , most of the low - temperature anomalies including the enhanced low temperature thermopower in fesi are explained upon including the electronic correlations in realistic many - body calculations.@xcite the onset of a magnetic phase transition has been demonstrated as the reason for the presence of distinct features in thermopower in mn@xmath8cr@xmath9sb.@xcite unusual jumps in seebeck coefficient data have been measured in the parent compound of the fe - based superconductor lafeaso,@xcite zn@xmath10sb@xmath3@xcite and la@xmath11nd@xmath9sr@xmath12cuo@xmath10,@xcite all of which have been explained in terms of structural phase transitions .",
    "recently , the observation of a large negative seebeck coefficient of -4500@xmath2vk@xmath1 at 18k in single crystalline crsb@xmath5 has been suggested to emerge from the dominating phonon - drag effect at low temperatures.@xcite    the intermetallic compound fega@xmath3 was first found during the systematic studies in the binary system fe - ga .",
    "the crystal structure was originally ascribed to a non - centrosymmetric structure type irin@xmath3.@xcite on the contrary , a centrosymmetric space group @xmath134@xmath14 was suggested later for the description of the symmetry for the crystal structure of fega@xmath3.@xcite more recent studies confirmed the centrosymmetric crystal structure and reported the first observation of semiconducting behavior.@xcite thermoelectric properties ( te ) at temperatures from 300 to 950k with negative thermopower values were later determined on polycrystalline samples.@xcite the first characterization on fega@xmath3 single crystals depending on the crystallographic orientation was reported in ref .",
    "but the authors observe the appearance of gallium inclusions of approximately 3% in their samples .",
    "fega@xmath3 was found to be diamagnetic , which was later validated.@xcite presence of an energy gap was established using magnetic susceptibility measurements ( 0.29 - 0.45ev ) and as well as by valence band x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( @xmath15 0.8ev ) , while @xmath16fe mssbauer spectroscopy revealed the absence of magnetic ordering.@xcite nevertheless , considering the narrow 3@xmath6 bands , yin and pickett@xcite explored the option of a magnetically ordered ground state in fega@xmath3 using total energy calculations and obtained an antiferromagnetically ordered spin - singlet state upon inclusion of correlation effects .",
    "though no verifiable experimental evidence for a magnetic transition in fega@xmath3 exists , muon spin rotation spectra@xcite show the existence of a spin - polaron band , which is consistent with the presence of an antiferromagnetic spin - singlet scenario . photoemission and inverse photoemission spectroscopic experiments@xcite have also been performed on single crystals of fega@xmath3 to probe its electronic structure and provide an estimate for the amount of correlation effects in this material .",
    "the measured band dispersions were comparable to calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) which included a coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath4 @xmath17 3ev .",
    "nonetheless , the authors conclude that the correlation effects in fega@xmath3 is not as significant as in fesi .",
    "recently , another study on doped fe(ga , ge)@xmath3 systems using total energy calculations reports an itinerant mechanism ( @xmath18 suggesting a minor role of the electron correlations implicitly ) for the experimentally observed ferromagnetism in the @xmath19-type samples.@xcite    in our opinion , the presence / absence of magnetism and/or correlations for the stoichiometric fega@xmath3 systems is still an open question . until now",
