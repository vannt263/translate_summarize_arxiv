    "phonon - plasmon coupled modes arise as a result of the interaction of optical phonons with charge carriers in semiconductors .",
    "these modes are usually observed in the absence of a magnetic field , for instance , in raman scattering @xcite .",
    "interest in these modes is related not only to applications in optics but also to principal questions of condensed - state physics , in particular , to the possibility of determining the magnitude of electron - phonon interaction with their help .",
    "the first experimental results for the raman scattering on phonon - plasmon coupled modes in magnetic fields were recently obtained @xcite , but only the preliminary theoretical paper @xcite has been published up to now .    the longitudinal optical phonons interact strongly with free carriers because of an electric field accompanied in the lattice vibrations .",
    "let us estimate the parameters of the corresponding electron - phonon system .",
    "the frequency of an emitted or absorbed optical phonon @xmath0 is usually equal to several hundreds of degrees , for example , this is 35 mv in gaas . if the light scattering is excited by the laser frequency @xmath1 ev , the momentum transfer @xmath2 from the incident radiation has the order of @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "then , the conditions @xmath5 are fulfilled , where the fermi velocity is @xmath6 cm / c in the case when the statistics of carriers is degenerate .",
    "the left - hand side of the above inequality means that the electric field associated with the phonon vibration of frequency @xmath0 is really static and therefore the electric field is longitudinal with respect to the wavevector @xmath7 .",
    "the right - hand side of the inequality allows the electron contribution to the dielectric function @xmath8 to be calculated using a series expansion in terms of the dispersion parameter @xmath9 .",
    "we shall see that at least the lowest - order correction should be held , because it has a resonant character . as for the lattice contribution to @xmath8",
    ", it can be taken at @xmath10 , since the phonon dispersion is negligible for such the momentum .",
    "the effect of magnetic field on optical phonons is most essential if the cyclotron frequency of carriers @xmath11 has the order of the optical phonon frequency .",
    "this means that the magnetic field must reach 20 t for effective carrier mass of 0.063 @xmath12 in the same gaas .",
    "changing the carrier concentration , we can observe both the semiclassical regime , when the cyclotron frequency is much less than the fermi energy ( @xmath13 ) , and the ultra - quantum regime , when @xmath14 .",
    "two circumstances should be noted .",
    "firstly , both the frequency of the coupled modes and the width of the corresponding resonance are of interest in the raman light scattering .",
    "therefore , the contribution of carriers to the dielectric susceptibility must be calculated with regard to their damping .",
    "the spatial dispersion of susceptibility in a magnetic field under these conditions has not been calculated so far .",
    "secondly , in addition to the coulomb interaction of carriers with the longitudinal phonon vibrations , which is taken into account by the dielectric function , there exists a deformation interaction with both the lo and to modes , which bears the frhlich name in theoretical works .",
    "it arises because of the nonadiabaticity of electron - phonon systems and leads to a certain ( as small as the nonadiabaticity parameter ) renormalization of phonon frequencies . in the absence of a magnetic field , this renormalization has been recently considered in @xcite - @xcite , and it will not be taken into account here .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "a short outline of the theory of raman scattering on the phonon - plasmon coupled mode is give in sec .",
    "then the dielectric function of the system in semiclassical and ultra - quantum regimes is evaluated in secs .",
    "iii and iv .",
    "the theoretical raman spectra are presented for the various magnetic fields and carrier concentrations in sec .",
    "v. finally , the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "let us consider the raman scattering on optical vibrations in a polar lattice with free carriers .",
    "we use the notations @xmath15 for the phonon displacements of the branch @xmath16 .",
    "the subscript @xmath16 denotes the various phonon modes : longitudinal or transverse ones .",
    "more precisely , the subscript @xmath16 indicates the different phonon representations which can be degenerate .",
    "the transformation properties of the coupling constants @xmath17 are determined by this representation .",
    "the lo vibrations are accompanied by the internal electric field @xmath18 .",
    "we consider the phonon displacements and electric field as classical variables because the magnetic field affects quantum - mechanically only the free carriers .",
    "the effective hamiltonian describing the inelastic light scattering on phonon ",
    "plasmon modes can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a linear form of variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we do not include the pure electronic raman scattering by free carriers , which has been considered in many papers ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the notation @xmath23 is introduced for a product of the vector - potentials of incident and scattered photons : @xmath24 u({\\bf k } , \\omega),\\ ] ] where the momentum and frequency transfers @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the polarization vectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the incident and scattered photons are included in the coupling constants as well as the polarization vector of @xmath29 is included in the coupling constant @xmath30 .",
    "the estimation of the coupling constants gives @xmath31 , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the lattice parameter .    if we evaluate the generalized susceptibility @xmath34 in the linear response to the force @xmath35 @xmath36 we obtain the raman cross - section @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the normal to the sample surface component of the scattered wave vector in vacuum .",
    "one note should be made here .",
    "of course , any sample has the surface .",
    "the surface effects in the raman scattering was considered in the work @xcite and they are omitted in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the incident and scattered fields do not penetrate into the bulk due to the skin effect .",
    "for the optical range of the incident light , we have the normal skin - effect conditions",
    ". then we integrate in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) the distribution @xmath39 over the normal component @xmath40 .",
    "as shown in the paper @xcite , the integration of @xmath39 gives a factor @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is expressed in terms of the wave - vector components inside semiconductor : @xmath43 .",
    "the raman cross section ( [ 8 ] ) obtained is dimensionless .",
    "it represents a ratio of the inelastic scattered light energy to the incident energy .",
    "the equation of motion for the lo mode @xmath44 has the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of unit cells in 1 @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the reduced mass of the unit cell , and @xmath49 is the effective ionic charge .",
    "notice that the optical phonons always have the so - called natural width @xmath50 .",
    "the natural width results from decay processes into two or more acoustic and optical phonons . in the final expressions",
    ", we will substitute @xmath51 .",
    "the equation ( [ oeq ] ) is applied as well to the transverse phonons , but the electric field has to be neglected in the case of the to phonons .",
    "the electric field @xmath29 can be obtained from the poisson equation @xmath52 .",
    "there are several contributions in the induction @xmath53 : ( 1 ) the polarization @xmath54 of the filled electron bands , ( 2 ) the lattice polarization @xmath55 , ( 3 ) the contribution of free carrier density @xmath56 , and ( 4 ) the term @xmath57 explicitly results from the hamiltonian , eqs .",

    "@xmath13 , we can use the boltzmann equation @xmath75 written in the @xmath76approximation within the momentum variables : the component @xmath77 along the magnetic field , the angle @xmath78 of rotation around the magnetic field , and the energy @xmath79 .",

    "4 electron concentrations .",
    "the faust - henry coefficient is taken @xmath180 as is usually accepted in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "we see always three peaks : the weak resonance approximately at @xmath181 and two resonances corresponding @xmath168 . far from the crossing , the modes have mainly a character of the phonon or plasmon vibrations .    from the splitting in figs . 1 and 2",
    ", we can conclude that the resonance at @xmath181 interacts more intensively with the mode of the plasmon character ( @xmath182 for the large concentration of carriers and @xmath183 for the low concentration ) .",
    "the figure 3 ( see , also , fig .",
    "1 ) clearly demonstrates the result of screening in the case of a relatively large concentration of carriers : the frequency @xmath183 , which equals the frequency of the longitudinal mode in the absence of carriers ( at the particular choice of parameters , @xmath184 ) , turns out to be close to the frequency of the transverse mode @xmath185 .",
    "the case of the relatively low carrier concentration is illustrated by figs . 2 and 4 .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "4 that , in a weak field @xmath186 , the frequency of the longitudinal mode is close ( as it must be ) to @xmath184 . besides the weak resonance at @xmath170 , a phonon - plasmon crossover is seen in the curves for @xmath187 . as the magnetic field increases ,",
    "the weaker plasmon peak , after passing through the phonon one , becomes more intense .",
    "in this work we investigated the spatial dispersion effect in the raman scattering on the phonon - plasmon coupled modes . in spite of the small value of corresponding parameters @xmath188 ( for the semiclassical magnetic fields ) and @xmath189 ( for the ultra - quantum regime ) , this effect is observable in the high magnetic fields when the cyclotron resonances intersect the frequencies of the phonon - plasmon coupled modes .",
    "the magnetic field provides an additional parameter which gives a possibility to compare the effect of the electron interaction with both the longitudinal and transverse optical modes in doped semiconductors ."
