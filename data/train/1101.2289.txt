    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are two peculiar kinds of pulsar - like objects .",
    "their persistent x - ray luminosities are in excess of their rotational energy loss rates , while at the same time they show no binary signature ( review mereghetti 2008 ) .",
    "they also show recurrent sgr - type bursts ( review hurley 2009 ) .",
    "therefore , the energy budget of axps and sgrs is a fundamental problem in their studies .",
    "they are supposed to be magnetic field powered , i.e. , magnetars ( thompson & duncan 1995 , 1996 ) .",
    "another possibility is that they are accretion powered systems , i.e. , accretion from supernova fallback disks ( alpar 2001 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "2000 ; xu et al . 2006 ) .",
    "then , it is of fundamental importance to determine whether they are magnetars or fallback disk systems .",
    "solving this problem is also helpful to other high - energy astrophysical phenomena and related pulsar - like objects ( xu 2007 ; tong et al .",
    "2010a )    cheng & zhang ( 2001 ) proposed that although axps are slowly rotating neutron stars , if their surface dipole magnetic field is strong enough ( i.e. , if they are really magnetars ) then they can accelerate particles and emit high - energy gamma - rays which are detectable by fermi - lat according to the outer gap model ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) .",
    "however , sasmaz mus & gogus ( 2010 ) reported a non - detection in a fermi - lat observation of axp 4u 0142 + 61 .",
    "this observation is in conflict with the outer gap model .",
    "tong et al .",
    "( 2010b ) proposed that fermi - lat observations can help us distinguish between the magnetar model and the fallback disk model .",
    "recently , the fermi - lat collaboration have published their observations for all known axps and sgrs ( five sgrs and eight axps ) , where still no significant detection is reported ( abdo et al .",
    "considering this discrepancy between theory and observations , it is then very necessary to do a comprehensive study of this issue .    in cheng & zhang ( 2001 ) , only five axps are considered and the paremeters they used are very uncertain , e.g. , the surface temperatures are estimated from the x - ray luminosities , etc .",
    "now , we have very good observational data for more sources ( see the mcgill axp / sgr online catalog ) . on the other hand , there are also developments of the outer gap model ( e.g. , takata et al .",
    "in this paper , with up - to - date observational parameters of axps and sgrs , we consider the high - energy gamma - ray radiation properties of axps and sgrs in the outer gap model ( zhang & cheng 1997 ; takata et al .",
    "2010 ) and compare them with fermi - lat observations .",
    "section 2 is application of self - consistent outer gaps to axps and sgrs .",
    "we consider both the magnetar model and fallback disk model .",
    "discussions and conclusions are presented in section 3 and section 4 , respectively .",
    "the outer gap is very successful in explaining pulsar high - energy emissions ( cheng et al .",
    "1986 ; review cheng 2009 ) .",
    "zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) developed the self - consistent outer gap model where the longitudinal extension of outer gap is determined self - consistently by the @xmath0 pair production process .",
    "if the x - ray photons are provided by neutron star surface thermal emission , the size of outer gap is ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the neutron star rotation period , @xmath3 is the surface magnetic field in units of @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the surface temperature in units of @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the neutron star radius in units of @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 should be less than one for outer gap to exist .",
    "takata et al . ( 2010 ) further considered the @xmath10b pair production process as a gap closure mechanism .",
    "the size of outer gap at half the light cylinder radius is ( takata et al . 2010 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the rotation period in units of 0.1 seconds , @xmath13 depends on the local geometry of magnetic fields at which the @xmath10b process takes place ( takata et al .",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 is a dimensionless parameter in units of @xmath16 , which depends on the angle between photon propagation direction and magnetic field , @xmath17 is the multipole field in units of @xmath4 , @xmath18 is the local curvature radius in units @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the neutron star radius , and @xmath21 is the radial distance at which the @xmath10b process takes place .      with up - to - date observational parameters of axps and sgrs , we have calculated the gamma - ray radiation properties of all axps and sgrs which have period , period derivative , surface temperature , and distance measurement ( except one source in smc ) .",
    "three sgrs and ten axps ( including two candidates ) are selected .",
    "the results are summarized in table 1 . the period , period derivative , surface temperature , and distance data are all from the mcgill axp / sgr catalogpulsar / magnetar / main.html , up to february 9 , 2011 ] ( except the distance data of sgr 0501 + 4516 which is from abdo et al . ( 2010b ) and reference therein ) . the magnetic field is calculated from @xmath22 , which is 2 times larger than usually reported since polar magnetic field is more important in the case of pulsar radiation ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "we consider the typical case with inclination angle equals @xmath23 ( cheng & zhang 2001 ) .",
    "the solid angle is chosen as @xmath24 .",
    "a star radius @xmath25 is employed , which corresponds to medium to stiff equation of state . a medium to stiff equation of state is favored by the recently measured 2 solar - mass neutron star ( demorest et al . 2010 ) .",
    "for a magnetar , whose surface magnetic field is about @xmath26 , the @xmath10b pair production process will take place at about 10 stellar radius where the magnetic field is about @xmath4 .",
    "then the k - parameter in equation ( [ fm ] ) is about 2 .",
    "since magnetars are slowly rotating neutron stars , the size of outer gap @xmath27 will always be larger than one .",
    "therefore , for magnetars , the gap closure mechanism will be dominated by the @xmath0 pair production process .",
    "this conclusion is depicted quantitively in table 1 . from table 1 , we see that only for one axp 1e 2259 + 586 , the size of outer gap is larger than one",
    ". therefore , this axp will not emit high - energy gamma - rays .",
    "for the rest of axps and sgrs , they are all high - energy gamma - ray emitters according to the outer gap model ( zhang & cheng 1997 ) .",
    "the theoretical spectra energy distributions ( seds ) are calculated following zhang & cheng ( 1997 ) , cheng & zhang ( 2001 ) .",
    "for the three sgrs and nine axps ( including two candidate axps ) , their spectra are shown in figure 1 and 2 , and summarized in table 1 .",
    "we see that due to their large distances , the three sgrs ( sgr 1806 - 20 , sgr 1900 + 14 , and sgr 0501 + 4516 ) and four axps ( cxo j164710.2 - 455216 , 1rxs j170849.0 - 400910 , 1e 1841 - 045 , and psr j1622 - 4950 ) can not be detected by fermi - lat for one year exposure time , i.e. , their seds lie below the fermi - lat sensitivity curve . for cxou j171405.7 - 381031 ,",
    "its seds lie in the vicinity of fermi - lat sensitivity curve .",
    "therefore , the detectability is only marginal .",
    "the most notable exceptions are 1e 1547.0 - 5408 , xte j1810 - 197 , 1e 1048.1 - 5937 , and 4u 0142 + 61 , whose seds lie well above the fermi - lat sensitivity curve .",

    "therefore , the applicability of outer gap model to magnetars may seem not very convincing at first sight .",
    "however , when deducing the star magnetic field from timing observations , the magnetic dipole braking mechanism is employed as in the case of rotation powered pulsars ( e.g. , kouveliotou et al .",
    "the consequence of magnetic dipole braking is that the rotational energy of axps and sgrs are carried away by similar processes to that of rotation powered pulsars .",
    "therefore , there should be some rotation powered activities in magnetars and the high - energy gamma - ray emissions are just one of them ( zhang 2003 ) .",
    "the high - energy gamma - ray properties of axps and sgrs discussed in previous sections are the consequences of their strong surface dipole field .",
    "the magnetosphere of magnetars may be more complicated than that of rotation powered pulsars , e.g. , it may be twisted ( thompson et al .",
    "a twisted magnetosphere contains higher multipoles in addition to a dipole component . far away in the outer magnetosphere ( as in the case of outer gap model )",
    ", the higher multipoles will be suppressed dramatically .",
    "thus the dipole component will dominate in the outer magnetosphere of magnetars .",
    "the magnetic field strength there is below the quantum critical value .",
    "therefore , we can apply the outer gap model to magnetars ( cheng & zhang 2001 ) . considering the detailed electrodynamics of magnetars ,",
    "the magnetic field is only quantitatively stronger than the dipole case ( thompson et al .",
    "the corotation charge density now has an extra term in addition to the goldreich - julian term @xmath40 ( thompson et al .",
    "however , the twist term is only present in closed field line regions in the vicinity of neutron star surface where the magnetic field is strong and highly twisted ( beloborodov & thompson 2007 ) . in the outer magnetosphere where",
    "the magnetic field has been decreased greatly , the goldreich - julian term will dominate and we expect there will also be null charge surfaces as in the case of rotation powered pulsars . the existence of null charge surface ensures the existence of outer gaps ( cheng et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "simulations of pair cascades in strong magnetic field show that the main results are not strongly affected by photon splitting and a magnetar strength field but only dependent on the acceleration potential ( medin & lai 2010 ) .",
    "the the maximum acceleration potential from a rotating dipole is @xmath41 ( cheng 2009 ) . for axps and sgrs",
    "whose rotation period is about 10 seconds , if their surface magnetic fields are about @xmath26 , then they may accelerate particles to high enough energy and emit high - energy gamma - rays .    in conclusion ,",
    "the applicability of outer gap model to magnetars is plausible .",
    "axps and sgrs are high - energy gamma - ray emitters in the magnetar model because they have strong surface dipole field .",
    "we now consider the possibility that axps and sgrs are fallback disk systems ( alpar 2001 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "the accretion flow will quench the magnetospheric activities of the putative neutron star .",
    "the radiation due to accretion will be mainly in the soft x - ray and hard x - ray band ( frank et al .",
    "recent fallback disk modeling of axps and sgrs can explain their soft and hard x - ray spectra uniformly ( trumper et al . 2010 ) .",
    "fermi - lat observations of the most luminous axp 4u 0142 + 61 also indicate an energy break at about @xmath42(sasmaz mus & gogus 2010 ; abdo et al .",
    "2010b ) .",
    "high - energy gamma - ray radiation of axps and sgrs in the fallback disk case are considered by ertan & cheng ( 2004 ) in the disk - star dynamo model ( they only calculate the case of axp 4u 0142 + 61 ) . in order to generate high - energy gamma - rays ,",
    "the inner disk has to rotate faster than the neutron star .",
    "however , this can not be fulfilled for the debris disk around axp 4u 0142 + 61 either as a passive disk ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ) or a gaseous accretion disk ( ertan et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer gap is not supposed to operate in the fallback disk case mainly due to the dense accretion flow",
    ". therefore , axps and sgrs are not high - energy gamma - ray emitters if they are fallback disk systems .",
    "our calculations show that the gap closure mechanism is dominated by @xmath0 pair production process in the case of magnetars .",
    "the seed x - ray photons are provided by surface thermal emission .",
    "observationally there is also a power law component of soft x - ray photons ( mereghetti 2008 ) .",
    "the inclusion of power law soft x - ray photons will enhance the magnetospheric activities of magnetars ( zhang & cheng 2002 ) .",
    "however , physical modeling of the power law component shows that it is also of thermal origin both in the case of magnetars ( lyutikov & gavriil 2006 ; tong et al .",
    "2010a ) and in the case of fallback disk systems ( trumper et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the inclination angle is the main factor determining the spectra shape for different sources , see figure 3 .",
    "the larger the inclination angle , the harder the gamma - ray spectra .",
    "modern outer gap model shows that the outer gap may extend below the null charge surface ( hirotani 2006 ) .",
    "tong et al .",
    "( 2010b ) try to take this effect into consideration when calculating the gamma - ray spectra .",
    "the corresponding spectra is similar to the case of large inclination angles , e.g. , @xmath39 .    during our calculations ,",
    "the solid angle @xmath43 is chosen as unity which is usually assumed ( cheng & zhang 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "outer gap modeling of fermi gamma - ray pulsars also gives an average solid angle of order unity ( wang et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the axps and sgrs lie mainly in the galatic plane",
    ". the fermi - lat threshold sensitivity may be 3 - 5 times larger in the galatic plane than that at higher latitude as in the case of gamma - ray pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "this will render the fermi - lat detectability marginal even for the four most gamma - ray luminous axps 1e 1547.0 - 5408 , xte j1810 - 197 , 1e 1048.1 - 5937 , and 4u 0142 + 61 .",
    "the 17 months exposure improves the fermi - lat sensitivity curve in figure 1 and 2 quantitatively .",
    "future deeper fermi - lat observations are required in order to make clear this issue .",
    "in addition to the outer gap model , there are also other high - energy gamma - ray emission mechanisms . for ordinary gamma - ray pulsars ,",
    "the high - energy gamma - ray radiation should come from the outer magnetosphere ( abdo et al .",
    "2010a ) . outer gap ( cheng 2009 ) , slot gap ( harding 2009 ) , and annular gap ( qiao et al .",
    "2007 ) , etc , are possible candidates .",
    "calculations in other high - energy emission models are called for .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly concern about the high - energy gamma - ray properties of axps and sgrs .",
    "tong et al .",
    "( 2010b ) discussed the multiwave properties of 4u 0142 + 61 as an example .",
    "the demerit of fallback disk model for axps and sgrs is that it can not account for the bursts easily ( e.g. , trumper et al .",
    "however , bursts ( especially giant flares ) in the accretion model are not absolutely impossible ( see discussions of rothschild et al . 2002 ; xu et al .",
    "2006 ; ertan et al .",
    "2007 ) .    as first pointed out by tong et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , the non - detection in fermi observations of all axps and sgrs provides challenges to the magnetar model .",
    "axps and sgrs are high - energy gamma - ray emitters in the magentar model because they have strong surface dipole field .",
    "the strong surface dipole field is the consequence of magnetic dipole braking ( e.g. , kouveliotou et al .",
    "since axps and sgrs are assumed to be magnetic field powered in the magnetar model , it is possible that they have different braking mechanisms to that of rotation powered pulsars ( e.g. , wind braking , harding et al .",
    "assuming wind braking for all axps and sgrs , the corresponding surface dipole field is in the range of normal radio pulsars ( harding et al .",
    "1999 , they only calculated the case of sgr 1806 - 20 ) .",
    "this may explain the non - detection of fermi - lat observations of all axps and sgrs , at the expenses of dropping the commonly referred magnetic dipole braking assumption and the consequent strong surface dipole field .",
    "the recently discovered low magnetic field sgr ( sgr 0418 + 5729 with @xmath44 , rea et al .",
    "2010 ) is consistent with the above analysis .",
    "detailed calculations will be presented in a separate paper .    in the future ,",
    "if fermi - lat can detect high - energy gamma - ray emissions from one axp or sgr , it will be strong evidence for magnetar dipole field ( @xmath45 ) for this source .",
    "this will also open another window for measuring the effect of strong magnetic fields , i.e. , through unipolar induction effect .",
    "this method is independent of timing measurement , which may be magnetic dipole braking or disk braking . on the other hand ,",
    "if still no significant detection is reported in fermi - lat deep observations , it will provide severe challenges to the magnetar model . from figure 1 and 2",
    ", we see that for many axps and sgrs , their theoretical spectra are two or three times lower than the fermi - lat one year sensitivity curve .",
    "four ( nine ) years exposure time will make the sensitivity curve two ( three ) times lower .",
    "therefore , we expect future four to nine years exposure time will make clear this issue .",
    "in this paper , we calculate the application of self - consistent outer gaps ( zhang & cheng 1997 ; takata et al . 2010 ) to the case of magnetars and compare the results with fermi - lat observations of all known axps and sgrs ( abdo et al .",
