    "many applications in engineering and science need to build accurate digital models of real - world objects defined in terms of _ point cloud data _ , _ i.e. _ a set of scattered points in 3d .",
    "typical examples include the digitalization of manufactured parts for quality control , statues and artifacts in archeology and arts @xcite , human bodies for movies or video games , organs and anatomical parts for medical diagnostic @xcite and elevation models for simulations and modeling @xcite . using modern 3d scanners , it is possible to acquire point clouds containing millions of points sampled from an object .",
    "the process of building a geometric model from such point clouds is usually referred to as _ surface reconstruction_.    there are several approaches to reconstruct surfaces from 3d scattered datasets .",
    "generally , the methods of surface reconstruction fall into two categories @xcite : delaunay - based methods and volumetric and implicit based methods .",
    "delaunay triangulation is usually utilized to find the possible neighbors for each point in all directions from all samples .",
    "implicit surface modeling instead is most popular for describing complex shapes and complex editing operations . among them , level set methods @xcite , moving least square methods @xcite , variational implicit surfaces @xcite and adaptively sampled distance field @xcite are recent developments in this field . in this paper",
    "we focus on the implicit surface method based on radial basis functions ( rbfs ) . in",
    "the 1980 s , franke @xcite used radial basis functions to interpolate scattered point cloud firstly and proved the accuracy and stability of the interpolation based on rbfs . using this technique ,",
    "an implicit surface is constructed by calculating the weights of a set of radial basis functions whose linear combination interpolates the given data points .",
    "the rbf applicability is hindered by its computational demand , since these methods require the solution of a linear system of size equal to the number of data points and current 3d data scanners allow acquisition of tens of millions points of an object surface .",
    "high performance computing ( hpc ) is a natural solution to provide the computational power required in such situations . in this paper",
    "we propose a method designed for a massively multi - core architecture , namely graphics processing units ( gpus ) @xcite .",
    "recently , gpus have been effectively used to accelerate the performance of applications in several scientific areas such as computational fluid dynamics , molecular dynamics , climate modeling @xcite . for our knowledge ,",
    "the most efficient parallel algorithm for rbf interpolation is `` petrbf '' @xcite .",
    "petrbf is a parallel algorithm for rbf interpolation that exhibits @xmath0 complexity , requires @xmath0 storage , and scales excellently up to a thousand processes .",
    "our main contribute is a deep re - engineering of petrbf which constitutes a generalization for scattered 3d data and an extension for gpu acceleration on heterogeneous clusters .",
    "we also focus on the suitable choice of the algorithm parameters and present an optimal strategy for synthetic , real or incomplete datasets .    in section",
    "ii we deal mathematical preliminaries , in section iii we describe the related works and the implementation strategies . the section iv we report the numerical experiments and finally we draw conclusions in section v.",
    "in this section we recall the reconstruction based on implicit surface method and define the related rbf interpolation problem .      given a point cloud @xmath1 coming from an unknown surface @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath3 , the goal is to find another surface @xmath4 which is a reconstruction of @xmath2 . in the implicit surface approach @xmath2",
    "is defined as the surface of all points @xmath5 that satisfy the implicit equation @xmath6 for an unknown function @xmath7 .",
    "a way to approximate @xmath7 is to impose the interpolation conditions ( [ eq : impl ] ) on the point cloud @xmath8 .",
    "however , the use of those interpolation conditions only leads to the trivial solution given by the identically zero function , whose zero surface is @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , the key for finding an approximation of the function @xmath7 is to use additional significant interpolation conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ on correspondence of off - surface points ( where @xmath10 ) .",
    "this involves a nontrivial interpolant @xmath11 , whose zero surface contains a meaningful surface @xmath4 .",
    "this approach leads to a surface reconstruction method which consists of three main steps :    1 .",
    "generation of off - surface points ; 2 .",
    "interpolant model identification on the extended dataset ; 3 .",
    "computation of the interpolation zero iso - surface .       + a common practice , as suggested in @xcite , is to use the set of surface normals @xmath12 to the surface @xmath2 at points @xmath13 .",
    "if these normals are not explicitly known , there are techniques and tools that to allow to estimate them . given the oriented surface normals ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 )",
    ", we generate the extra off - surface points by marching a small distance @xmath16 along the normals .",
    "so , we obtain for each cloud data point @xmath13 two additional off - surface points .",
    "the first lies `` outside '' the surface @xmath2 and is given by @xmath17 the other point lies `` inside '' and is given by @xmath18 the union of the sets @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath8 gives the overall set of points on which the interpolation conditions are assigned ( see fig .",
    "[ img : extdset ] ) .    , in blue points from @xmath21 and in green points from @xmath22,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the set @xmath21 implicitly defines a surface @xmath23 which passes through its points .",
    "analogously @xmath22 defines the surface @xmath24 .",
    "those two surfaces can be considered respectively external and internal to @xmath2 .",
    "the value of @xmath16 represents a small step size whose specific magnitude may be rather critical for a good surface reconstruction @xcite . in particular , if @xmath16 is chosen too large , this results in self intersecting @xmath23 or @xmath24 auxiliary surfaces .",
    "in our implementation we fix @xmath16 to @xmath25 of the bounding box of the data as suggested in @xcite .       + this step consists in determining a function @xmath11 whose zero contour interpolates the given point cloud data @xmath8 and whose iso - surface @xmath26 and @xmath27 interpolate @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath28 the values of @xmath29 for the auxiliary data are assigned in an arbitrary way",
    ". such choice does not affect the quality of the results . in this discussion",
    "we are interested to the iso - surface zeros of @xmath11 .       + in order to evaluate the @xmath11 zero iso - surface and visualize it , we use a simple strategy which consists on evaluating the interpolant @xmath11 on a dense grid of a bounding box .",
    "this approach leads to some undesired artifacts , since in the bounding box there are points that do not belong to @xmath4 .",
    "a possible way to overcome this drawback and display only @xmath4 consists in evaluating the interpolant only in a small _ surrounding _ volume of the surface @xmath2 to reconstruct .",
    "this set is denoted as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 . for a small enough value of @xmath32 it holds @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the zero iso - surface of @xmath11 .",
    "given a set of @xmath35 distinct points @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the scattered data interpolation problem is to find an interpolant function @xmath11 such that : @xmath40 in the univariate setting , the interpolant @xmath11 is usually chosen in suitable spaces of functions .",
    "a common approach assumes that the function @xmath11 is a linear combination of certain basis function @xmath41 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath42 in the multivariate setting ( @xmath43 ) , however , the problem is much more complex . as stated by the _ mairhuber - curtis _ theorem @xcite , in order to have a well - posed multivariate scattered data interpolation problem it is not possible to fix in advance the basis @xmath44 .",
    "instead the basis must depend on the data location .    in order to obtain data dependent approximation space , as suggested by the mairhuber - curtis theorem , the rbf interpolation uses radial functions : @xmath45 the points @xmath46 to which the basic function @xmath47 is shifted are usually referred as _",
    "centers_. while there may be circumstances that suggest to choose these centers different from the data sites one generally picks the centers to coincide with the data sites .",
    "the interpolation problem consists of two subproblems : finding the interpolant @xmath11 and evaluating it on an assigned set of points .",
    "the coefficients @xmath48 in ( [ eq : base_exp ] ) are obtained by imposing the interpolation conditions ( [ eq : interp_cond ] ) @xmath49 this leads to solve a linear system of equations ( [ eq : rbfsys ] ) .",
    "@xmath50}_{x } = \\underbrace{\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } y_1 \\\\",
    "\\\\ \\vdots \\\\",
    "y_n \\end{array } \\right]}_{b}\\ ] ]    given a set of @xmath51 points @xmath52 the evaluation of the interpolant @xmath11 on @xmath53 can be computed with a matrix vector product ( [ matxvet ] )    @xmath54 =   \\begin{bmatrix}\\varphi(\\vert \\xi_1-x_1\\vert ) & \\varphi(\\vert \\xi_1-x_2\\vert ) & \\cdots & \\varphi(\\vert \\xi_1-x_n\\vert)\\\\ \\varphi(\\vert \\xi_2-x_1\\vert ) & \\varphi(\\vert \\xi_2-x_2\\vert ) & \\cdots & \\varphi(\\vert \\xi_2-x_n\\vert)\\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\ \\varphi(\\vert \\xi_m - x_1\\vert ) & \\varphi(\\vert \\xi_m - x_2\\vert ) & \\cdots & \\varphi(\\vert \\xi_m - x_n\\vert)\\end{bmatrix }   \\cdot \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ c_n \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ]    the rbf interpolant determination consists to solve a linear system of equations @xmath55 . in order to have a well - posed problem",
    "the matrix @xmath56 must be non - singular .",
    "unfortunately no one has yet succeeded in characterizing the class of all basic function @xmath47 that generates a non - singular matrix for arbitrary set @xmath57 of distinct data sites .",
    "the situation is however much better with _ positive definite matrices_. an important property of positive definite matrices is that all their eigenvalues are positive , and therefore a positive definite matrix is non - singular .",
    "popular radial basis function @xmath58 , that give rise to positive definite interpolation matrices , are summarized in table [ tab : rbfs ] , we focused our work ( as @xcite ) on the gaussian function taking advantage of its property as described in  3 .",

    "we have implemented a parallel implicit method based on radial basis functions for surface reconstruction .",
    "this implementation relies on parallel scientific libraries and is supported for the gpu device . since the reconstruction quality and the performances are strongly related to the gaussian rbf parameter @xmath59 , we propose an optimal and heuristic estimate based on some density measures of the point cloud .",
    "finally , the obtained speed - up and running time confirm that the rbf interpolant can be a very effective algorithm for such problem .",
