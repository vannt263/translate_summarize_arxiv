    "spectroscopic redshift measurements of large galaxy samples form the backbone of many extragalactic and cosmological analyses .",
    "they are key for testing cosmological models , e.g.  using redshift space distortions @xcite , and for providing distances for galaxy population studies when the cosmology is assumed .",
    "redshifts from spectroscopy ( spec-@xmath0 ) generally have significantly fewer outliers , compared to the true redshift , than from photometric estimates ( photo-@xmath0 ; @xcite ) . in addition ,",
    "spec-@xmath0 measurements are essential for accurate low - redshift luminosity estimates ( @xmath1 ) , where the photo-@xmath0 fractional error is too large , and for dynamical measurements within groups of galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "redshift surveys of large numbers of galaxies have been undertaken in recent years using multi - object spectrographs such as the two degree field ( 2df , @xcite ) , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , visible multi - object spectrograph ( vimos , @xcite ) , and deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos , @xcite ) . for uniformity of a survey product over a large sample",
    ", redshift measurement codes have been developed that are either fully automatic @xcite or partially automatic with some user interaction @xcite .",
    "the main techniques for spectroscopic redshift measurements are : the identification and fitting of spectral features @xcite ; cross - correlation of observed spectra with template spectra @xcite ; and @xmath2 fitting using linear combinations of eigenspectra @xcite . a widely used code is rvsao that allows for cross - correlation with absorption - line and emission - line templates separately @xcite . the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and sdss have used a dual method with fitting of emission line features and cross - correlation with templates after clipping the identified emission lines from the observed spectra @xcite .",
    "the large vimos surveys have used the ez software @xcite , which provides a number of options including emission - line finding , cross - correlation and @xmath2 fitting . from sdss data release 8 ( dr8 ) onwards @xcite , including the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) targets ,",
    "the measurements have used @xmath2 fitting at trial redshifts with sets of eigenspectra for galaxies and quasars @xcite .",
    "the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey is based around a redshift survey that was designed , in large part , for finding and characterising groups of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the survey has obtained over 200000 redshifts using spectra from the aaomega spectrograph of the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) fed by the 2df fibre positioner .",
    "aaomega is a bench - mounted spectrograph with light coming from a 392-fibre slit , split into two beams , each dispersed with a volume - phase holographic grating and focused onto ccds using a schmidt camera .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "up until 2013 , all the aaomega redshifts had been obtained using runz @xcite , which is an update to the code used by the 2dfgrs @xcite .",
    "the user assigns a redshift quality for each spectrum from 14 , which can later be changed or normalised during a quality control process @xcite . by comparing the redshifts assigned to repeated aaomega observations of the same target ,",
    "the typical redshift uncertainty was estimated to be @xmath3km / s .",
    "in addition , the blunder rate was @xmath4 per cent even when the redshifts were assigned a reliable redshift quality of 4 . in order to improve the redshift reliability and uncertainties , and thus the group catalogue measurements ,",
    "a fully automatic code was developed called autoz .    here",
    "we describe the autoz algorithm , which uses a cross - correlation method that works equally well with absorption or emission line templates , and that is robust to additive / subtractive residuals and other uncertainties in the reduction pipeline that outputs the spectra .",
    "this has substantially improved the gama redshift reliability and velocity errors ( liske et al.in preparation ) .",

    "the method for finding the best redshift estimate is outlined in ",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the gama survey is based around a highly complete galaxy redshift survey and multi - wavelength database @xcite . since the initial spectroscopic target selection over 144@xmath5 described in @xcite ,",
    "the survey has been expanded to 280@xmath5 with a main survey limit of @xmath6 in all five regions : equatorial fields g09 , g12 and g15 and southern fields g02 and g23 .",
    "the spectra were obtained from the anglo - australian telescope with the two - degree field ( 2df ) robotic positioner fibre feed to the aaomega spectrograph . in total , 286705 spectra of 237822 unique targets were taken over six years , in all weather conditions .",
    "the spectra were reduced using 2dfdr @xcite .",
    "the gama setup and data processing details are described in @xcite .    in order to obtain high completeness , both in targeting and redshift success , the same region of the sky",
    "was observed multiple times with different aaomega configurations @xcite .",
    "the spectra were reduced using 2dfdr and redshifts were measured using runz typically within 24 hours of the observations . in between observing seasons , the spectra were usually re - reduced using the most recent update to the 2dfdr pipeline processing .",
    "in addition , a significant fraction of spectra were looked at by multiple users in order to quantify the reliability of the runz redshift assignments ( liske et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the tiling catalogue was updated during an observing season , or in between observing seasons , using the latest assigned redshift qualities .",
    "if a target was not assigned a sufficient redshift quality and had not been observed twice by aaomega , then it remained at high priority in the tiling catalogue . in most cases ,",
    "a target received a higher - quality redshift on its second attempt .",
    "[ fig : fibre - histo ] shows the distribution of fibre magnitudes of the gama targets that were observed by aaomega ( most targets with high quality redshifts from sdss or 2dfgrs were not observed ) , and the mean number of aaomega observations as a function of fibre magnitude . at bright fibre magnitudes , only a few per cent of targets",
    "were observed twice because they were first observed in poor conditions or for quality control purposes . at fainter fibre magnitudes ,",
    "the number of targets observed more than once is higher because , even in average or good conditions , the runz user was assigning a low quality redshift .",
    "thus the strategy has worked , as expected , to obtain more observations for the fainter targets . as a result of the strategy , we have repeat observations of 40319 targets .",
    "these repeats have been used to fine tune a new fully automatic redshift code called autoz , and can be used for coadding to increase the spectral signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this has significantly improved the redshift measurements with respect to the user assigned redshifts from runz ( liske et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the code autoz uses the cross - correlation method for obtaining redshifts for spectra with or without strong emission lines .",
    "it is described as a _ fait accompli _ , but there have been several iterations , each time checking to see if changes to the code resulted in an improvement .",
    "the tuning of parameters was optimised for performance with the aaomega spectra . after each iteration ,",
    "for example , redshift confidence estimates were calibrated from the repeat observations , the total number of high confidence redshifts was determined , and selected spectra and cross - correlation functions were inspected .",
    "the sdss has set a high standard for automatic redshift determination .",
    "for autoz , we used their templates for spectral cross - correlation .",
    "these are a high s / n set of coadded spectra given in a similar format to the sdss spectra for scientific targets .",
    "table  [ tab : templates ] lists the templates used for this paper .",
    "twenty stellar spectra were used .",
    "early versions of autoz used the six sdss dr2 galaxy templates @xcite , while later versions used eight galaxy templates that were created from the sdss - boss galaxy eigenspectra @xcite .",
    "six of these templates were chosen to closely match the dr2 templates where there was common wavelength coverage , with an additional two selected to represent a post - starburst spectrum @xcite and a typical sdss - boss spectrum .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the spectra were available rebinned onto a vacuum wavelength scale separated by 0.0001 in @xmath7 .",
    "this corresponds to a pixel size of 0.92  at 4000  and 1.84  at 8000 .",
    "the spectral templates were high - pass filtered using a two step robust procedure :    1 .",
    "a 4th - order polynomial was fitted to the spectrum iteratively , with a maximum of 15 iterations .",
    "after each iteration , points more than 3.5@xmath8 away from the best - fit curve were rejected .",
    "the final 4th - order polynomial was then subtracted from the spectrum .",
    "a median kernel filter of width 51 was applied to the result of the 1st step . on each end , the 25 edge points were given a median value of those points .",
    "this median filtered spectrum was smoothed using a trapezium filter , by applying two boxcar smooths of width 121 and 21 .",
    "this low - pass spectrum was then subtracted from the result of the 1st step to obtain the high - pass filtered ( hpf ) spectrum .",
    "the aim of the first step was to remove the large - scale modes from the spectrum so that the second step involving median filtering was not compromised by a steeply rising spectrum , for example .",
    "the hpf spectra also had their edge points set smoothly to zero using a cosine bell taper ( apodization , @xcite ) .",
    "the chosen or maximum wavelength coverage of each template is given in table  [ tab : templates ] .",
    "a demonstration of the method is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hp - procedure ] for the old - stellar galaxy template number 23 .",
    "the final hpf spectra for the templates were clipped to lie between @xmath9 and @xmath10 times the mean absolute deviation , determined iteratively until convergence within a small tolerance .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : template26 ] . here",
    "five emission lines are clipped .",
    "this is to avoid giving too much weight to a single strong line , which could give rise to cross - correlation spikes in bad data . in effect ,",
    "a cross - correlation of this template with data gives a high peak when two or more lines line up with matched wavelength spacing .",
    "in other words , the correct wavelength spacing gives rise to higher confidence in the redshift with less weight given to the relative strengths of any lines .",
    "we note that in sdss dr8 onwards , the method for determining redshifts used @xmath2 fitting with combinations of four eigenspectra for galaxies @xcite . while we can not follow their method for fitting because of the less reliable spectrophotometry of the aaomega spectra , combinations of these eigenspectra were used to extend the wavelength range of the galaxy templates down to shorter wavelengths .",
    "these are templates 4047 in the autoz code , in order of increasing strength of emission lines .",
    "the aaomega pipeline produces a spectrum and error spectrum for each target , with the red and blue beams combined to a single linear scale with a pixel width of 1.036 .",
    "these were then approximately flux calibrated to relative @xmath11 units using an average flux correction determined for the survey .",
    "the reason for doing this is that the sdss spectral templates are calibrated in @xmath11 units ; and even though the spectra are high - pass filtered , the weighting is affected by the calibration .",
    "the aaomega spectra for the gama survey were high - pass filtered in the same way as the spectral templates .",
    "the cosine bell taper was set between 3786 and 3736  at the low - wavelength end and between 8790 and 8840  at the high - wavelength end .",
    "each error spectrum was broadened using a maximum filter kernel of width 3 .",
    "this broadening allows for the uncertainty in the alignment of sky subtraction .",
    "in other words , this is to account for underestimation by 2dfdr of the error spectrum near sky lines .",
    "the hpf spectrum was then divided by the square of the error spectrum .",
    "this weighting was justified by @xcite as appropriate for effectively minimising @xmath2 when finding the peak . fig .",
    "[ fig : example - hpf ] shows the filtering procedure applied to an aaomega spectrum .",
    "the high - pass filtering is aggressive for both the templates and aaomega spectra .",
    "this is to mitigate against artefacts on the scale of around 200  and longer , for example , ` fringing ' caused by a separation between the prism and optical fibre at the 2df plate , and an imperfect join between the spectra from the red and blue arms of the spectrograph ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it is more straightforward to define a reliable automatic confidence estimate using hpf spectra where these scales have been removed .",
    "the hpf spectra were then clipped to lie between @xmath12 and 25 times the mean absolute deviation . , which were the same as those used for the templates .",
    "they were changed to @xmath13 to alleviate some redshift disagreements between matched spectra at high figure - of - merit values (   [ sec : confidence ] ) . ]",
    "this was chosen so that , in general , only high s / n spectra had genuine lines clipped . in these cases , the clipping does not compromise the cross - correlation peak position significantly because there is more than sufficient signal in less extreme deviations in any case .",
    "the clipping of the templates and aaomega hpf spectra means that no single emission line , or apparent emission line , can result in a high confidence redshift .",
    "this approach is therefore more robust to bad data : uncorrected hot pixels , cosmic rays , or misaligned sky subtraction .",
    "bad pixels that had been accounted for were set to zero in the hpf spectra .",
    "the template and target hpf spectra were linearly rebinned onto a logarithmic vacuum wavelength .",
    "a lookup table was created for the conversion factor as a function of @xmath14 , and the values determined for the aaomega wavelengths by interpolation .",
    "the conversion factor varies between 1.000275 and 1.000285 . ]",
    "scale from 3.3 to 4.0 ( with zero padding , @xcite ) with a pixel width of @xmath15 , which corresponds to @xmath16 . for each target hpf spectrum , the cross - correlation function was determined for all the templates using the usual procedure involving fast fourier transforms @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlation values were associated with heliocentric redshifts given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the shift in pixels corresponding to position @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the redshift of the template spectrum , usually zero ; and @xmath21 is component of the velocity of the earth in the heliocentric frame toward the target ( if the target spectrum was not put on a heliocentric wavelength scale ) .         for each template ,",
    "a search range for finding redshifts and a noise - estimate redshift range for the normalisation procedure were defined .",
    "the ranges for each template are given in table  [ tab : templates ] .",
    "the cross - correlation functions were normalised by subtracting a truncated mean computed over the noise - estimate range , which results in a small adjustment , and dividing by the root mean square ( rms ) of the turning points computed over the same range .",
    "typically the cross - correlation functions had between 350 and 850 turning points over the noise - estimate range .",
    "[ fig : cross - correlation ] shows three examples of normalised cross - correlation functions .",
    "for each target spectrum , all the normalised cross - correlation functions were determined corresponding to each template being used ( 26 or 28 templates ; see table  [ tab : templates ] ) .",
    "first , the highest cross - correlation peak , within the search ranges , was taken to be the best estimate of the redshift .",
    "the next three best redshifts were determined after excluding peaks within 600km / s of the better redshift estimates , considering all templates , at each stage .",
    "the values of the peaks are called @xmath22 ( following the nomenclature of @xcite ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 each with a corresponding redshift and template number . in order to avoid discretisation at the rebinned resolution ,",
    "the redshifts were fine tuned by fitting a quadratic to seven points centred on each peak .",
    "note that the highest redshift allowed was set at 0.9 , which is appropriate for the gama magnitude limit and the fact that the autoz code has not been adapted to search for quasar redshifts .      in order that the normalised cross - correlation functions , @xmath22 values , can be compared between different templates",
    ", it is important that the noise - estimate ranges are set appropriately .",
    "the cross - correlation function computed using fast fourier transforms gives values for @xmath26 from @xmath27 to @xmath28 ( about @xmath29 to 1.24 ) because of the rebinned logarithmic scale from 3.3 to 4.0 .",
    "zero padding is necessary because of the wrap - around assumption of this cross - correlation method . as a result ,",
    "the amplitude of a cross - correlation function can drop significantly when the overlap between the rest - frame wavelength range of the template ( table  [ tab : templates ] ) and the observed wavelength range of the target decreases .",
    "thus a more useful estimate of the noise is obtained by computing the rms over a reduced redshift range , here called the noise - estimate range .",
    "the noise - estimate range for the galaxy templates is chosen to encompass the search redshift range with additional negative redshifts . the noise - estimate range for the stellar templates",
    "covers a shorter range because of the reduced rest - frame wavelength coverage . for late - type stars ,",
    "the noise estimate uses more negative redshifts because there are larger deviations at the red - end of the template spectra . as a final test of the normalisation procedure , using repeated observations or",
    "otherwise , it can be apparent if certain templates give rise to numerous false redshift peaks (   [ sec : confidence ] ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the process for estimating the likelihood that the highest normalised cross - correlation peak corresponds to the correct redshift . in cases where the distribution of the cross - correlation function values of the turning points is close enough to gaussian ,",
    "then the value of @xmath22 can be used to give an estimate of the redshift confidence ( e.g.  @xcite ; see @xcite for a theoretical estimate ) . however , in most cases , there are a few high values of the cross - correlation functions because of aliasing between emission lines , for example . to test the reliability of the best redshift estimate",
    ", we also consider the ratio between the highest peak and the subsequent peaks , here , given by @xmath30    fig .",
    "[ fig : fom - calc ] shows the distribution of an adjusted @xmath31 versus @xmath22 for 286705 aaomega spectra .",
    "cross - correlations with the templates that have weak or no emission lines tend to follow the diagonal ridge line while spectra that have higher peaks using the emission lines dominate the hill to the right .",
    "cross - correlations with noise populate the bottom left corner . of the two variables",
    ", @xmath31 gives a better figure of merit ( fom ) for relating to redshift confidence .",

    "was determined by fitting to the ridge line .",
    "the value of @xmath36 was adjusted by trial and error to give the largest number of high confidence redshifts from the aaomega spectra , after calibrating the confidence each time . in the absence of sufficient repeat spectra , fitting to the ridge line would provide an adequate estimate for an improved fom . ] the line where these variables are the same is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fom - calc ] .     versus @xmath22 .",
    "the solid lines represent logarithmically spaced density contours with a factor of two between each level .",
    "the dashed line shows where the two values are equal . ]",
    "three further adjustments , penalty functions , to the fom were made .",
    "the first is because in cases of poor sky subtraction or other reduction problems , @xmath37 can still be above 5 even when there is no signal from the target source .",
    "for each hpf spectrum , the ratio of the rms to mean absolute deviation ( mad ) was determined .",
    "this value ( rms / mad ) is high when there is good signal from the target or when there is non - poisson noise , i.e. , reduction problems .",
    "thus , the fom can be reduced when @xmath38 ( the median value is 1.44 ) without losing genuine redshifts .",
    "the adjustment is given by @xmath39    the second adjustment is particular to the sample targeted .",
    "so far only a flat prior has been set for the allowed redshifts ; this is given by the search ranges .",
    "however , there are far fewer galaxies at @xmath40 than at lower redshifts in the gama survey",
    ". this adjustment is given by @xmath41 and thus @xmath42    finally , contamination by solar - system light was checked on a tile by tile basis , by looking for an excessive number of g - star template matches .",
    "the number of stars observed as part of our main survey is about two per cent @xcite .",
    "when there was a clustering of ten or more matches to templates 710 ( best or second - best redshift estimate ) , the tile was checked for solar - system contamination .",
    "this was caused by moonlight , under conditions where scattering had significant structure on the sub - tile scale , with one notable exception .",
    "a cluster of about twenty matches was found to be centred on the location of saturn at the time of the observation .",
    "the spectrum of saturn can be seen clearly in a few fibres ; autoz does not have this template but picks up the reflected solar absorption lines . in total ,",
    "20 tiles were flagged as having possible solar contamination , and any best redshift match to templates 710 was given a @xmath43 value of 2.5 .",
    "this was applied to about 300 spectra and these were not included in the redshift confidence estimation . in most cases ,",
    "the targets were re - observed .",
    "the calibration of @xmath43 to a redshift confidence was made by comparing autoz redshifts between different spectra of the same target position ( matched spectra ) .. this is significantly less than the fibre diameter , which subtends @xmath44 on the sky . ] redshift measurements were considered to be in agreement if they were within 450km / s [ @xmath45 and in disagreement otherwise . the probability of agreement is taken to be @xmath46 where the function @xmath47 gives the probability each spectrum is correct as function of the fom .",
    "this ignores the small chance that both redshifts are incorrect but in agreement with each other or that both redshifts are correct but are of different superimposed sources .",
    "the second effect was noticeable prior to suppression of the solar - system contamination .    in order to estimate @xmath48 ,",
    "two binned samples were considered .",
    "the first sample uses the matched spectra where one of the fom values is higher by more than 1.0 , and the sample is binned by the lower fom value . in each bin",
    "the estimate of @xmath48 is then @xmath49 , which assumes the redshift is correct for the spectrum with the higher fom value .",

    "this is shown by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fom - calibration ] .",
    "various subsamples of the matched spectra were also considered including a randomly selected repeat sample ( these were targets that were chosen for reobservation regardless of their assigned redshift quality ) , and subsamples where one of the spectra had a particular best - match template .",
    "the calibration points for the subsamples , at which the redshift confidence was 0.9 , varied from @xmath53 to 4.6 .",
    "the notable exception was where one of the matched spectra had a stellar template match .",
    "here there were a higher fraction of disagreements at @xmath54 than in other subsamples ( 0.9 confidence at 5.2 ) .",
    "this is a result of star - galaxy blends and is not of concern for the autoz method .",
    "the gama target selection is for extended sources , and thus it is not surprising that a higher fraction of targets with stellar redshifts are part of a star - galaxy blend compared to random selection ; in addition spectra of star - galaxy blends are more likely to have been reobserved given the increased difficulty of assigning redshifts using runz .",
    "overall , we use @xmath55 and @xmath56 to assign redshift confidence , which is slightly more conservative than the best fit to all the matched spectra ( fig .  [",

    "following @xcite and from trial and error , a reasonable predictor of the ability to centroid is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the velocity full - width half maximum of the peak .",
    "the latter is determined from the number of rebinned pixels ( 13.8km / s ) within 600km / s of the peak above the half maximum of the cross - correlation function .",
    "this is more robust and less time consuming than fitting a gaussian or other function to the peak .",
    "overall , we model the variance in the velocity ( redshift ) uncertainty as : @xmath65 thus the expected mean square of the velocity difference between matched spectra @xmath19 and @xmath66 is given by @xmath67    fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity - errors ] shows the velocity difference ( @xmath68 ) versus the predictor value @xmath69 .",
    "this shows that the mean velocity difference increases with average @xmath70 as expected .",
    "the mean square values of the velocity differences were determined in bins of the predictor value .",
    "these binned values are shown in the figure ( plotted as three times the rms value ) and were used to determine @xmath71 and @xmath72 using a fit between 45 and 260 . over this range ,",
    "the fit is good and thus is expected to give a reasonable estimate of @xmath73 .",
    "the fit overpredicts the velocity difference at predictor values less than 45 .",
    "these correspond to spectra with strong emission lines .",
    "for the purposes of group dynamical measurements , it is more important to have an accurate measure of the velocity uncertainty when this uncertainty is larger and thus we apply the fit to all the gama - aaomega spectra . for the high quality redshift sample ( @xmath59 ) ,",
    "the median @xmath73 is 33km / s , with 85 per cent of redshifts having an uncertainty less than 50km / s using this calibration .",
    "[ fig : fibre - velocity ] shows the distribution of velocity uncertainty as a function of the fibre magnitude .    .",
    "the points represent the @xmath74 values for the matched spectra .",
    "the squares , with error bars , show _ three times _ the rms velocity differences in bins .",
    "the dashed lines show one , two and three times the rms values using a fit for @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( eq .  [ eqn : velocity - fit ] ) between 45 and 260 . ]          at the start of the gama spectroscopic campaign , sdss dr7 and other pre - existing redshifts were matched to the input catalogue @xcite .",
    "since then sdss has had three more data releases , including spectra from the boss survey @xcite .",
    "in addition , the primary method of determining redshifts was updated to @xmath2 fitting using eigenspectra @xcite .",
    "this was applied retrospectively to all plates observed for the sdss surveys .    in order to compare gama autoz redshifts with sdss",
    ", we selected all sdss dr10 redshifts in the gama fields with zwarning=0 ( primarily a reduced @xmath2 difference of more than 0.010 between the 1st and 2nd redshift peaks ) .",
    "this corresponds approximately to @xmath59 from our tests , and as implied by @xcite s test , which showed that as the @xmath2 difference threshold was lowered to 0.008 , 8% of the additional redshifts were estimated to be incorrect . matching the sdss zwarning=0 spectra from dr10 to the gama aaomega spectra ( @xmath59 , excluding spectroscopic standards ) within 1arcsec results in 9426 cross matches . from these",
    ", 99.1% have redshifts in agreement between gama and sdss , which is as expected for a mean confidence of 99.5% for the gama sample and a similar value for the sdss sample .",
    "there are 1748 matches to spectra from the original sdss spectrographs that were part of the legacy survey ( main galaxy sample and luminous red galaxies ) .",
    "these matches were obtained for quality control purposes or because sdss had reported a low redshift confidence in dr7 .",
    "there are 7674 matches to spectra from the boss spectrographs and survey .",
    "the large number of matches is a result of gama and boss independently choosing these targets .",
    "[ fig : gama - sdss - veldiff ] shows the velocity difference histogram for the two samples [ @xmath75 .",
    "for the legacy sample , the mean and standard deviation were 12 and 38km / s , and for the boss sample , they were 5 and 53km / s .",
    "the standard deviations are as predicted from the velocity errors estimated above for gama , with a smaller contribution from sdss as estimated by @xcite . the larger mean offset with respect to the legacy sample",
    "may be because of the different eigenspectra used : speigengal-53724.fits as opposed to speigengal-55740.fits used by boss and gama autoz .",
    "other than this small anomaly , the comparison with sdss supports the gama estimates of redshift confidence and velocity uncertainty described in this paper .",
    "we have developed a redshift measurement code called autoz for use on the gama aaomega spectra .",
    "the method uses the cross - correlation technique with robust high - pass filtering suitable for galaxy and stellar types applied to the templates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hp - procedure ] ) and observed spectra ( fig .  [ fig : example - hpf ] ) .",
    "the observed hpf spectra are inversely weighted by the variance estimated at each pixel , broadened slightly by a maximum kernel filter . to avoid giving too much weight to emission line matches , large deviations in the hpf spectra",
    "are partially clipped for both the observed spectra and templates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : template26 ] ) . lowering the weight of large deviations",
    "reduces the impact of spurious peaks caused by uncorrected artefacts .",
    "real cross - correlation peaks are rarely adversely affected by this because there is additional signal at the correct redshift peaks from other parts of the spectra .    for each observed spectrum ,",
    "the cross - correlation functions are determined for every chosen template .",
    "each function is normalized by dividing by the rms of the turning points over a specified noise - estimate range ( table  [ tab : templates ] ) .",
    "these ranges were chosen so that the value of a peak represents a similar confidence level across all the templates .",
    "the best four redshift estimates are obtained from the cross - correlation function peaks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cross - correlation ] ) , not including peaks within 600km / s of a better redshift estimate . a fom for the redshift confidence",
    "is determined using the value of the highest peak ( @xmath22 ) , and the ratio of @xmath22 to the rms of the 2nd , 3rd and 4th peaks ( eqs .",
    "[ eqn : ccsigma1to234][eqn : fom - prelim ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : fom - calc ] ) .",
    "overall , the procedure can be adjusted and the fom calibrated using repeat observations within a survey .    the gama aaomega redshift survey has taken spectra of over 230000 unique targets . as part of a strategy of obtaining high completeness and for quality control , about 40000 targets have had two or more spectra taken .",
    "these repeats were used to calibrate the confidence level as a function of the fom using a maximum likelihood method ( eqs .",
    "[ eqn : tanh][eqn : ml ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : fom - calibration ] ) . overall , the autoz code has significantly improved the redshift reliability within the gama main sample , with a high completeness for targets with @xmath76-aperture @xmath77-band magnitudes as faint as 21mag ( fig .  [",
    "fig : comp - progress ] ) .",
    "the redshift uncertainties have also been calibrated using the repeat observations , with most having redshift errors less than 50km / s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fibre - velocity ] ) .",
    "autoz measurements will be included in public data releases from gama dr3 onwards .    with some consideration to making adjustments",
    " templates , high - pass filtering scale , clipping limits , noise - estimate ranges , fom calculation and calibration  the fully automatic method outlined here could be used for other large galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "a key factor is using a sufficient number of repeats , both random and at the fainter end of the sample , to allow for an accurate empirical confidence calibration .",
