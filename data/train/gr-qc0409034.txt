    "breakthroughs in modern technology have made possible the construction of extremely large interferometers both on ground and in space for the detection and observation of gravitational waves  ( gw ) .",
    "several ground based detectors are being constructed or are already operational around the globe .",
    "these are the ligo and virgo interferometers , which have arm - lengths of 4 km and 3 km respectively , and the geo and tama interferometers with arm - lengths of 600 m and 300 m respectively .",
    "these detectors will operate in the high frequency range of gw of @xmath0 hz to a few khz .",
    "a natural limit occurs on decreasing the lower frequency cut - off of  @xmath1 hz because it is not practical to increase the arm - lengths on ground and also because of the gravity gradient noise which is difficult to eliminate below  @xmath1 hz",
    ". however , virgo and future detectors such as the advanced ligo , the proposed lcgt in japan and the large european detector plan to go to substantially below @xmath1 hz .",
    "thus , in any case , the ground based interferometers will not be sensitive below the limiting frequency of @xmath2 hz . but on the other hand , there exist in the cosmos , interesting astrophysical gw sources which emit gw below this frequency such as the galactic binaries , massive and super - massive black - hole binaries etc . if we wish to observe these sources , we need to go to lower frequencies .",
    "the solution is to build an interferometer in space , where such noises will be absent and allow the detection of gw in the low frequency regime .",
    "lisa -  _ laser interferometric space antenna _  - is a proposed mission which will use coherent laser beams exchanged between three identical spacecraft forming a giant  ( almost ) equilateral triangle of side @xmath3 kilometers to observe and detect low frequency cosmic gw .",
    "the ground based detectors and lisa complement each other in the observation of gw in an essential way , analogous to the way optical , radio , x - ray , @xmath4-ray etc .",
    ", observations do for the electromagnetic spectrum . as these detectors begin to operate , a new era of gravitational astronomy is on the horizon and a radically different view of the universe",
    "is expected to emerge .",
    "the astrophysical sources that lisa could observe include galactic binaries , extra - galactic super - massive black - hole binaries and coalescences , and stochastic gw background from the early universe .",
    "coalescing binaries are one of the important sources in the lisa frequency band .",
    "these include galactic and extra galactic stellar mass binaries , and massive and super massive black - hole binaries .",
    "the frequency of the gw emitted by such a system is twice its orbital frequency .",
    "population synthesis studies indicate a large number of stellar mass binaries in the frequency range below 2 - 3 mhz  @xcite . in the lower frequency range ( @xmath5 mhz )",
    "there are a large number of such sources in each of the frequency bins .",
    "since gw detectors are omni - directional , it is impossible to resolve an individual source .",
    "these sources effectively form a stochastic gw background referred to as _ binary confusion noise_.    massive black - hole binaries are interesting both from the astrophysical and theoretical points of view .",
    "coalescences of massive blackholes from different galaxies after their merger during growth of the present galaxies would provide unique new information on galaxy formation .",
    "coalescence of binaries involving intermediate mass blackholes could help understand the formation and growth of massive blackholes .",
    "the super massive black hole binaries are strong emitters of gw and these spectacular events can be detectable beyond red - shift of @xmath6 .",
    "these systems would help to determine the cosmological parameters independently . and ,",
    "just as the cosmic microwave background is left over from the big bang , so too should there be a background of gravitational waves .",
    "unlike electromagnetic waves , gravitational waves do not interact with matter after a few planck times after the big bang , so they do not thermalize .",
    "their spectrum today , therefore , is simply a red - shifted version of the spectrum they formed with , which would throw light on the physical conditions at the epoch of the early universe .",
    "interferometric , non - resonant , detectors of gravitational radiation ( with frequency content @xmath7 ) use a coherent train of electromagnetic waves ( of nominal frequency @xmath8 ) folded into several beams , and at one or more points where these intersect , monitor relative fluctuations of frequency or phase ( homodyne detection ) .",
    "the observed low frequency fluctuations are due to several causes : ( a ) frequency variations of the source of the electromagnetic signal about @xmath9 , ( b ) relative motions of the electromagnetic source and the mirrors ( or amplifying transponders ) that do the folding , ( c ) temporal variations of the index of refraction along the beams , and , ( d ) according to general relativity , to any time - variable gravitational fields present , such as the transverse - traceless metric curvature of a passing plane gravitational wave train . to observe gravitational waves in this way , it is thus necessary to control , or monitor , the other sources of relative frequency fluctuations , and , in the data analysis , to use optimal algorithms based on the different characteristic interferometer responses to gravitational waves ( the signal ) and to the other sources ( the noise ) @xcite . by comparing phases of electromagnetic beams referenced to the same frequency generator and propagated along non - parallel equal - length arms , frequency fluctuations of the frequency reference can be removed and gravitational wave signals at levels many orders of magnitude lower can be detected .    in the present single - spacecraft doppler tracking observations , for instance ,",
    "many of the noise sources can be either reduced or calibrated by implementing appropriate microwave frequency links and by using specialized electronics @xcite , so the fundamental limitation is imposed by the frequency ( time - keeping ) fluctuations inherent to the reference clock that controls the microwave system .",
    "hydrogen maser clocks , currently used in doppler tracking experiments , achieve their best performance at about @xmath10 seconds integration time , with a fractional frequency stability of a few parts in @xmath11 .",
    "this is the reason why these one - arm interferometers in space ( which have one doppler readout and a `` 3-pulse '' response to gravitational waves @xcite ) are most sensitive to millihertz gravitational waves .",
    "this integration time is also comparable to the microwave propagation ( or `` storage '' ) time @xmath12 to spacecraft en route to the outer solar system ( for example @xmath13 for the cassini spacecraft ) @xcite .",
    "next - generation low - frequency interferometric gravitational wave detectors in solar orbits , such as the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) mission @xcite , have been proposed to achieve greater sensitivity to millihertz gravitational waves .",
    "since the armlengths of these space - based interferometers can differ by few percent , the direct recombination of the two beams at a photo detector will not however effectively remove the laser frequency noise .",
    "this is because the frequency fluctuations of the laser will be delayed by different amounts within the two unequal length arms . in order to cancel the laser frequency noise ,",
    "the time - varying doppler data must be recorded and post - processed to allow for arm - length differences @xcite .",
    "the data streams will have temporal structure , which can be described as due to many - pulse responses to @xmath14-function excitations , depending on time - of - flight delays in the response functions of the instrumental doppler noises and in the response to incident plane - parallel , transverse , and traceless gravitational waves .",
    "lisa will consists of three spacecraft orbiting the sun .",
    "each spacecraft will be equipped with two lasers sending beams to the other two ( @xmath15 au away ) while simultaneously measuring the beat frequencies between the local laser and the laser beams received from the other two spacecraft . the analysis of tdi presented in this article will assume a successful prior removal of any first - order doppler beat notes due to relative motions @xcite , giving six residual doppler time series as the raw data of a _ stationary _ time delay space interferometer .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , we will regard lisa not as constituting one or more conventional michelson interferometers , but rather , in a symmetrical way , a closed array of six one - arm delay lines between the test masses . in this way , during the course of the article , we will show that it is possible to synthesize new data combinations that cancel laser frequency noises , and estimate achievable sensitivities of these combinations in terms of the separate and relatively simple single arm - responses both to gravitational wave and instrumental noise ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to earth - based interferometers , which operate in the long - wavelength limit ( lwl ) ( arm lengths @xmath16 gravitational wavelength @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a characteristic frequency of the gw ) , lisa will @xmath19 operate in the lwl over much of its frequency band . when the physical scale of a free mass optical interferometer intended to detect gravitational waves is comparable to or larger than the gw wavelength , time delays in the response of the instrument to the waves , and travel times along beams in the instrument , can not be ignored and must be allowed for in computing the detector response used for data interpretation .",
    "it is convenient to formulate the instrumental responses in terms of observed differential frequency shifts @xmath20 for short , doppler shifts @xmath20 rather than in terms of phase shifts usually used in interferometry , although of course these data , as functions of time , are interconvertible .",
    "this first review article on tdi is organized as follows . in section [ secii ]",
    "we provide an overview of the physical and historical motivations of tdi . in section [ seciii ]",
    "we summarize the one - arm doppler transfer functions of an optical beam between two carefully shielded test masses inside each spacecraft resulting from ( i ) frequency fluctuations of the lasers used in transmission and reception , ( ii ) fluctuations due to non - inertial motions of the spacecraft , ( iii ) beam - pointing fluctuations and shot noise @xcite . among these ,",
    "the dominant noise is from the frequency fluctuations of the lasers and is several orders ( perhaps 7 or 8) above the other noises .",
    "this noise must be very precisely removed from the data in order to achieve the gw sensitivity at the level set by the remaining doppler noise sources which are at a much lower level and which constitute the noise floor after the laser frequency noise is suppressed .",
    "we show that this can be accomplished by shifting and linearly combining the twelve one - way doppler data lisa will measure .",
    "the actual procedure can easily be understood in terms of properly defined time - delay operators that act on the one - way doppler measurements .",
    "we develop a formalism involving the algebra of the time - delay operators which is based on the theory of rings and modules and computational commutative algebra .",
    "we show that the space of all possible interferometric combinations cancelling the laser frequency noise is a module over the polynomial ring in which the time - delay operators play the role of the indeterminates .",
    "the module , in the literature , is called the module of syzygies @xcite .",
    "we show that the module can be generated from _",
    "four _ generators , so that any data combination cancelling the laser frequency noise is simply a linear combination formed from these generators .",
    "we would like to emphasize that this is the mathematical structure underlying tdi in lisa .    in section [ seciv ] specific interferometric combinations",
    "are then derived , and their physical interpretations are discussed .",
    "the expressions for the sagnac interferometric combinations , ( @xmath21 ) are first obtained ; in particular , the symmetric sagnac combination @xmath22 , for which each raw data set needs to be delayed by only a @xmath23 arm transit time , distinguishes itself against all the other tdi combinations by having a higher order response to gravitational radiation in the lwl when the spacecraft separations are equal .",
    "we then express the unequal - arm michelson combinations , ( @xmath24 ) , in terms of the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath4 , and @xmath22 combinations with further transit time delays .",
    "one of these interferometric data combinations would still be available if the links between one pair of spacecraft were lost .",
    "other tdi combinations , which rely on only four of the possible six inter - spacecraft doppler measurements ( denoted @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) are also presented .",
    "they would of course be quite useful in case of potential loss of any two inter - spacecraft doppler measurements .",
    "time - delay interferometry so formulated presumes the spacecraft - to - spacecraft light - travel - times to be constant in time , and independent from being up- or down - links .",
    "reduction of data from moving interferometric laser arrays in solar orbit will in fact encounter non - symmetric up- and downlink light time differences that are significant , and need to be accounted for in order to exactly cancel the laser frequency fluctuations @xcite . in section [ secv ]",
    "we show that , by introducing a set of non - commuting time - delay operators , there exists a quite general procedure for deriving generalized tdi combinations that account for the effects of time - dependence of the arms . using this approach it is possible to derive ``",
    "flex - free '' expression for the unequal - arm michelson combinations @xmath30 , and obtain the generalized expressions for all the tdi combinations @xcite .    in section [ secvi ]",
    "we address the question of maximization of the lisa signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) to any gravitational wave signal present in its data .",
    "this is done by treating the snr as a functional over the space of all possible tdi combinations . as a simple application of the general formula we have derived",
    ", we apply our results to the case of sinusoidal signals randomly polarized and randomly distributed on the celestial sphere .",
    "we find that the standard lisa sensitivity figure derived for a single michelson interferometer @xcite can be improved by a factor of @xmath31 in the low - part of the frequency band , and by more than @xmath32 in the remaining part of the accessible band .",
    "further , we also show that if the location of the gw source is known , then as the source appears to move in the lisa reference frame , it is possible to optimally track the source , by appropriately changing the data combinations during the course of its trajectory @xcite , @xcite . as an example of such type of source ,",
    "we consider known binaries within our own galaxy .",
    "this first version of our `` living review '' article on tdi does not include all the results of more practical and experimental nature , as well as all the aspects of tdi that the data analysts will need to account for when analyzing the lisa tdi data combinations .",
    "our forthcoming `` second edition '' of this review paper will include these topics .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , as of today , the lisa project has endorsed tdi as its baseline technique for achieving the desired sensitivity to gravitational radiation .",
    "several experimental verifications and tests of tdi are being , and will be , performed at the nasa and esa lisa laboratories .",
    "although significant theoretical and experimental work has already been done for understanding and overcoming practical problems related to the implementation of tdi , more work on both sides of the atlantic is still needed .",
    "results of this undergoing effort will be included in the second edition of this living document .",
    "equal - arm interferometer detectors of gravitational waves can observe gravitational radiation by cancelling the laser frequency fluctuations affecting the light injected into their arms .",
    "this is done by comparing phases of split beams propagated along the equal ( but non - parallel ) arms of the detector .",
    "the laser frequency fluctuations affecting the two beams experience the same delay within the two equal - length arms and cancel out at the photodetector where relative phases are measured . this way gravitational wave signals of dimensionless amplitude less than @xmath33",
    "can be observed when using lasers whose frequency stability can be as large as roughly a few parts in @xmath34 .",
    "if the arms of the interferometer have different lengths , however , the exact cancellation of the laser frequency fluctuations , say @xmath35 , will no longer take place at the photodetector . in fact , the larger the difference between the two arms , the larger will be the magnitude of the laser frequency fluctuations affecting the detector response .",
    "if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the lengths of the two arms , it is easy to see that the amount of laser relative frequency fluctuations remaining in the response is equal to ( units in which the speed of light @xmath38 ) @xmath39 in the case of a space - based interferometer such as lisa , whose lasers are expected to display relative frequency fluctuations equal to about @xmath40 in the millihertz band , and whose arms will differ by a few percent @xcite , equation ( [ dc ] ) implies the following expression for the amplitude of the fourier components of the uncanceled laser frequency fluctuations ( an over imposed tilde denotes the operation of fourier transform ) @xmath41 at @xmath42 hz , for instance , and assuming @xmath43 , the uncanceled fluctuations from the laser are equal to @xmath44 .",
    "since the lisa sensitivity goal is about @xmath45 in this part of the frequency band , it is clear that an alternative experimental approach for canceling the laser frequency fluctuations is needed .",
    "a first attempt to solve this problem was presented in @xcite , and the scheme proposed there can be understood through figure [ 2unequalarms ] . in this idealized model",
    "the two beams exiting the two arms are not made to interfere at a common photodetector .",
    "rather , each is made to interfere with the incoming light from the laser at a photodetector , decoupling in this way the phase fluctuations experienced by the two beams in the two arms .",
    "now two doppler measurements are available in digital form , and the problem now becomes one of identifying an algorithm for digitally cancelling the laser frequency fluctuations from a resulting new data combination .     and",
    "@xmath37 , are different , now the light beams from the two arms are not recombined at one photo detector .",
    "instead each is separately made to interfere with the light that is injected into the arms .",
    "two distinct photo detectors are now used , and phase ( or frequency ) fluctuations are then monitored and recorded there.,width=7 ]    the algorithm they first proposed , and refined subsequently in @xcite , required processing the two doppler measurements , say @xmath46 and @xmath47 , in the fourier domain . if we denote with @xmath48 , @xmath49 the gravitational wave signals entering into the doppler data @xmath50 , @xmath51 respectively , and with @xmath52 , @xmath53 any other remaining noise affecting @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively , then the expressions for the doppler observables @xmath50 , @xmath51 can be written in the following form @xmath54 from eqs .",

    "the amount of residual laser noise remaining in the fourier - based combination described above , as a function of the integration time @xmath67 and type of `` window function '' used , was derived in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that , in order to suppress the residual laser noise below the lisa sensitivity level identified by secondary noises ( such as proof - mass and optical path noises ) with the use of the fourier - based algorithm an integration time of about six months was needed .    a solution to this problem",
    "was suggested in @xcite , which works entirely in the time - domain . from eqs.([2doppler1 ] , [ 2doppler2 ] ) we may notice that , by taking the difference of the two doppler data @xmath56 , @xmath75 , the frequency fluctuations of the laser now enter into this new data set in the following way @xmath76 if we now compare how the laser frequency fluctuations enter into eq .",
    "( [ y1-y2 ] ) against how they appear in eqs .",

    "this in essence is what time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) amounts to . in the following sections we will further elaborate and generalize tdi to the realistic lisa configuration",
    "the description of tdi for lisa is greatly simplified if we adopt the notation shown in figure [ geometry ] , where the overall geometry of the lisa detector is defined .",
    "there are three spacecraft , six optical benches , six lasers , six proof - masses and twelve photodetectors .",
    "there are also six phase difference data going clock - wise and counter - clockwise around the lisa triangle . for the moment we will make the simplifying assumption that the array is stationary , i.e. the back and forth optical paths between pairs of spacecraft are simply equal to their relative distances @xcite .",
    "several notations have been used in this context . the double index notation recently employed in @xcite",
    "where six quantities are involved is self - evident .",
    "however , when algebraic manipulations are involved the following notation seems more convenient to use .",
    "the spacecraft are labeled @xmath2 , @xmath77 , @xmath85 and their separating distances are denoted @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath86 , with @xmath87 being opposite spacecraft @xmath88 .",

    "we index the phase difference data to be analyzed as follows : the beam arriving at spacecraft @xmath88 has subscript @xmath88 and is primed or unprimed depending on whether the beam is traveling clockwise or counter - clockwise ( the sense defined here with reference to figure [ geometry ] ) around the lisa triangle respectively .",
    "thus , as seen from the figure , @xmath91 is the phase difference time series measured at reception at spacecraft @xmath2 with transmission from spacecraft @xmath77 ( along @xmath86 ) .    ,",
    "@xmath92 where the index @xmath88 corresponds to the opposite spacecraft .",
    "the unit vectors @xmath93 point between pairs of spacecraft , with the orientation indicated .",

    "the other four one - way phase difference time series from signals exchanged between the spacecraft are obtained by cyclic permutation of the indices : @xmath2 @xmath95 @xmath77 @xmath95 @xmath85 @xmath95 @xmath2 .",
    "we also adopt a notation for delayed data streams , which will be convenient later for algebraic manipulations .",
    "we define the three time - delay operators @xmath96 where for any data stream @xmath97 , _",
    "i x(t ) = x(t - l_i )  , where @xmath98 are the light travel times along the three arms of the lisa triangle ( the speed of light @xmath99 is assumed to be unity in this article ) .",

    "note that this notation is in the same spirit as in the references @xcite in which moving spacecraft arrays have been analyzed .",
    "we extend the cyclic terminology so that at vertex @xmath88 ( @xmath106 ) the random displacement vectors of the two proof masses are respectively denoted by @xmath107 , and the random displacements ( perhaps several orders of magnitude greater ) of their optical benches are correspondingly denoted by @xmath108 where the primed and unprimed indices correspond to the right and left optical benches respectively . as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "the analysis does assume that pairs of optical benches are rigidly connected , i.e. @xmath109 , in general .",
    "the present lisa design shows optical fibers transmitting signals both ways between adjacent benches .",

    "for the envisioned frequency differences ( a few hundred megahertz ) , however , the remaining fluctuations due to the optical fiber can be neglected @xcite .",
    "it is also assumed that the phase noise added by the fibers is independent of the direction of light propagation through them .",
    "for ease of presentation , in what follows we will assume the center frequencies of the lasers to be the same , and denote this frequency by @xmath9 .",
    "the laser phase noise in @xmath115 is therefore equal to @xmath116 .",

    "figure 2 endeavors to make the detailed light paths for these observations clear .",
    "an outgoing light beam transmitted to a distant spacecraft is routed from the laser on the local optical bench using mirrors and beam splitters ; this beam does not interact with the local proof mass .",
    "conversely , an _ incoming _ light beam from a distant spacecraft is bounced off the local proof mass before being reflected onto the photo receiver where it is mixed with light from the laser on that same optical bench .",

    "in this article we have summarized the use of tdi for canceling the laser phase noise from heterodyne phase measurements performed by a constellation of three spacecraft tracking each other along arms of unequal length .",

    "these methods have been motivated and illustrated with the simple example of an unequal arm interferometer in order to give a physical insight of tdi . here , these methods have been rigorously applied to the idealized case of a stationary lisa for deriving the generators of the module from which the entire tdi data set can be obtained ; they can be extended in a straightforward way to more than three spacecraft for possible lisa follow - on missions .",
    "the stationary lisa case was used as a propaedeutical introduction to the physical motivation of tdi , and for further extending it to the realistic lisa configuration of free - falling spacecraft orbiting around the sun .",
    "the tdi data combinations canceling laser phase noise in this general case are referred to as _ second generation tdi _ , and they contain twice as many terms as their corresponding _ first generation _ combinations valid for the stationary configuration .    as a data analysis application",
    "we have shown that it is possible to identify specific tdi combinations that will allow lisa to achieve optimal sensitivity to gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "the resulting improvement in sensitivity over that of an unequal - arm michelson interferometer , in the case of monochromatic signals randomly distributed over the celestial sphere and of random polarization , is non negligible .",
    "we have found this to be equal to a factor of @xmath31 in the low - part of the frequency band , and slightly more than @xmath32 in the high - part of the lisa band .",
    "the snr for binaries whose location in the sky is known but their polarization is not can also be optimized , and the degree of improvement depends on the location of the source in the sky .    as a final remark we would like to emphasize that this field of research , tdi , is still very young and evolving .",
    "possible physical phenomena , yet unrecognized , might turn out to be important to account for within the tdi framework .",
