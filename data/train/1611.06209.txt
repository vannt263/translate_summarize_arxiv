    "the radiation mechanism responsible for the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is still not very well understood .",
    "the observed spectra is generally modelled using the band function ( @xcite ) , which is a smoothly connected broken power - law with observed peak energy @xmath11 kev and non - thermal power - laws below and above the peak ( in some cases up to @xmath12 gev energies ) ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the two most widely explored models to explain the grb spectrum are the internal dissipation model and the photospheric model ( @xcite ) .    in the internal dissipation model ,",
    "the energy is dissipated either by internal shocks ( @xcite ) or by magnetic reconnection in a poynting dominated jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "the prompt radiation is due to the synchrotron emission from non - thermal electrons gyrating in a shock - generated magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "this model suffers from low radiation efficiency because only the kinetic energy associated with the differential motion of the shells can be dissipated and not the kinetic energy associated with the bulk motion of the jet ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the observations confirm high efficiencies up to few tens of percent ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , synchrotron emission can not explain hard grb spectra at low energies ( @xcite ) and the spectrum is directly related to the radiation mechanism involved rather than interaction with baryons and leptons in the jet .    owing to these shortcomings of the internal dissipation model",
    ", many researchers have recently focussed on the photospheric emission model ( @xcite ) . unlike the internal dissipation model",
    ", the photospheric model can explain the observed high radiation efficiencies .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is determined by the interaction of photons with matter in the jet , which is through compton scattering , and hence should be independent of the emission mechanism .",

    "the choice of synchotron spectrum over thermal spectrum for photons is justified as there are not enough scatterings at relatively small optical depths @xmath13 10 to thermalise the photon spectrum ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of the energy in the jet is carried by the protons because of their large mass and the average energy of the electrons is assumed to be much larger as compared to the average energy of the photons .",
    "we consider sub - photospheric heating of electrons which occurs as a result of continuous injection of energy from the protons through the coulomb interaction and is more physically motivated than episodic injection of energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "photons undergo multiple scatterings with the electrons and gain energy until the outflow becomes optically thin and the photons escape the photosphere .",

    "the e - p interaction slightly elevates the energy of the electrons but it does not change the photon spectrum and the proton energies appreciably .",
    "the e - e interaction plays an important role in redistributing energy among the electrons after they are heated by the e - p interactions .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath45 determine the amount of energy that the electrons can transfer to the photons through comptonization and the amount of energy that the protons can transfer to the electrons through e - p interactions , respectively .",
    "higher @xmath45 can also result in more energetic photons as the electrons will gain more energy from the protons to transfer it to the photons .",
    "however , for most part of the simulations , @xmath150t_{p , coul}^{\\prime}$ ] is of the same order as ic timescale in the jet - comoving frame which is given by , @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the radiation energy density .",
    "hence , the electrons attain an equilibrium @xmath47 after a certain number of scatterings and coulomb interaction is relatively unimportant in determining the shape of the output photon spectrum .",
    "@xmath180 is also an important parameter that affects the shape of the output photon spectrum .",
    "however for almost all our simulations ( except figure [ fig5 ] ) , we fix the seed photon spectrum ( as given by equation [ eqn1 ] ) to study the effect of other parameters and interactions better . as a photon",
    "can be upscattered to an energy @xmath181 after one scattering , more energetic photons ( with higher @xmath180 ) cool the electrons faster after multiple scatterings .",
    "we do not consider electron - positron pair production for our simulations as @xmath182 ev is much less than the rest mass energy of the electrons ( @xmath183 kev ) .",
    "the average number of scatterings experienced by a photon before escaping the photosphere is @xmath184 ( @xcite ) and hence @xmath1 also determines the shape of the output photon spectrum . for larger @xmath1 ,",
    "the electrons and the protons cool down more adiabatically ( see equations [ eqn4 ] and [ eqn5 ] ) . the photons get scattered multiple times thus increasing the probability of different photons getting scattered different number of times before escaping the photosphere .",
    "this results in broadening of the photon spectrum and the output photon spectrum looks shallower below @xmath8 .",
    "this broadening of the output photon spectrum at large @xmath1 is independent of the choice of the seed photon spectrum ( see figure [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "another parameter which affects the photon and electron energies is @xmath165 . for smaller @xmath165 ,",
    "there are more electrons to upscatter the photons to higher energies .",
    "moreover , @xmath27 implies that there are more protons to transfer energy to the electrons .",
    "hence , the output photon spectrum has more photons at higher energies resulting in a shallower spectrum above @xmath8 .",
    "it should be noted that unlike previous simulations ( @xcite ) , we do not re - accelerate the electrons back to their initial distribution . rather the electrons are redistributed to mb distribution whose peak temperature is determined using @xmath85 after each scattering event .",
    "we do not consider any external dissipation events for electron heating except the energy transfer from the protons to the electrons .",
    "now we discuss the constraint that @xmath43 and @xmath45 need to satisfy in order to have a power - law spectrum above @xmath128 . the total initial kinetic energy of the electrons and the protons at the beginning of the simulation is @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively .",
    "the energy available to the electrons should atleast be as large as the energy gain that is required by the photons to populate the high - energy tail .",
    "the energy transferred from the protons to the electrons in the course of the jet expansion is @xmath187 . in order to have a power - law spectrum above @xmath128 ,",
    "the energy of a fraction @xmath188 of the photons near peak - energy @xmath128 has to increase by a factor @xmath188 .",
    "assuming that most of the photons have energies close to the photon peak - energy @xmath128 , the electron @xmath43 and the proton @xmath45 should satisfy the energy constraint given by @xmath189 for our simulations , @xmath128 = 2 ev , @xmath24 and @xmath190 . @xmath191 and @xmath160 are evaluated when most of the scatterings occur with @xmath148 and @xmath192 ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) . for this choice of parameters ,",
    "the above condition is satisfied for @xmath193 and @xmath194 that we have considered .",
    "this explains the power - law spectrum from @xmath8 upto @xmath122 kev in all our simulations .",
    "now we discuss the evolution of energy for the photons , protons and electrons to explain our simulation results .",
    "the photons gain energy from the electrons through comptonization and cool due to adiabatic expansion .",
    "the ic timescale is much smaller compared to @xmath159 until the electrons cool down to non - relativistic energies ( @xmath195 .",
    "although some photons are upscattered to high energies through comptonization when the electrons are hot , the peak of the photon spectrum is affected only by adiabatic cooling and not ic cooling .",
    "this is expected as most of the scatterings occur after the electrons already cool down to non - relativistic energies making comptonization unimportant for determining @xmath128 in the output photon spectrum .",
    "the peak - energy of the output photon spectrum can be obtained using equations [ eqn3 ] and [ eqn6 ] , @xmath196 where @xmath197 ( @xmath198 ) is the peak - energy of the initial ( final ) photon spectrum in the jet - comoving frame .",
    "this is in good agreement with our simulation results for different @xmath1 and @xmath128 in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "the protons lose energy to the electrons through e - p interaction in addition to cooling adiabatically as the jet expands .",
    "the proton cooling timescale @xmath160 is much larger compared to @xmath199 when the electrons are relativistic ( see equation [ eqn7 ] ) .",
    "after the electrons cool down to non - relativistic energies , @xmath200 which increases faster compared to @xmath161 with the expansion of the jet .",
    "thus , e - p interaction is relatively unimportant in determining the final energy of the protons which is actually determined by adiabatic cooling . from figure [ fig6 ]",
    ", we can see that @xmath157 for most part of the simulation .",
    "thus , we can write using equation [ eqn5 ] , @xmath201 as @xmath202 . for @xmath143 and @xmath203 as used in the simulations in figure [ fig6 ] , @xmath204 which is in very good agreement with the @xmath78 value that we find by tracking the protons in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "while the electrons gain energy from the protons through e - p interaction , they also lose energy due to adiabatic expansion of the jet and comptonization .",
    "comptonization of electrons no longer decreases the energy of the electrons significantly after @xmath47 drops to @xmath205 ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we estimate the change in energy of the electrons due to the three processes : adiabatic cooling , comptonization and e - p interaction , after the electrons have cooled down to @xmath206 to explain our simulation results in figure [ fig6 ] .",
    "the evolution of @xmath47 due to adiabatic cooling is given by equation [ eqn4 ] .",
    "after the electrons have already cooled down to @xmath148 the energy change due to adiabatic cooling is , @xmath207 as @xmath208 . for @xmath143 and @xmath209",
    "as used in simulations in figure [ fig6 ] , @xmath210 . to estimate the change in @xmath47 due to comptonization and coulomb heating by the protons",
    ", we first evaluate the corresponding timescales along with the dynamical timescale ( all timescales averaged over @xmath60 ) for @xmath143 .",
    "for @xmath211 and @xmath157 , the @xmath60-averaged timescales are , @xmath212 @xmath213 @xmath214 the final energy of the electrons after @xmath215 due to ic is given by , @xmath216 which reduces to , @xmath217 @xmath47 of the electrons after @xmath218 due to coulomb heating by the protons is , @xmath219 thus , we find that the electron heating due to the coulomb interaction is faster than the rate of comptonization of the electrons",
    ". this explains our results in figure [ fig6 ] as @xmath47 obtained at the end of the simulation is higher when e - p interaction is considered .      in this subsection",
    ", we evaluate @xmath47 after the electrons reach equilibrium due to coulomb heating and comptonization .",
    "as the timescale for adiabatic cooling of electrons @xmath220 is much longer as compared to @xmath221 and @xmath222 , we can neglect adiabatic cooling while considering the equilibrium of the electrons .",
    "equating the ic energy loss rate with the coulomb energy gain rate for the electrons gives , @xmath223^{3/2 } + \\beta_{p}^{\\prime 3 } } = \\frac{4}{3}u_{\\gamma}^{\\prime}\\sigma_{t}(\\gamma_{e}^{\\prime 2 } - 1)c\\ ] ] using the expressions for @xmath62 , @xmath224 and @xmath158 , we obtain @xmath225 which gives @xmath226 .",
    "thus , the equilibrium @xmath47 is close to @xmath152 obtained in figure [ fig6 ] when e - p interaction is considered .",
    "the equilibrium @xmath47 is slightly higher than @xmath47 obtained at the end of the simulations for figure [ fig6 ] which is expected as we neglect adiabatic cooling and e - e interaction for our equilibrium calculations .    in our analysis",
    ", we have assumed that the electrons always cool due to ic and neglect the possibility that an energetic photon can transfer energy back to the electrons .",
    "however , there are about @xmath227 instances in each of the three cases ( without e - p and e - e , with e - p and with e - p and e - e ) when the electron energy increases to @xmath228 . as a result ,",
    "more photons are upscattered to higher energies and the power - law @xmath6 extends to @xmath122 kev for almost all our simulations .",
    "in addition , the compton - y parameter for sub - relativistic electrons ( @xcite ) is , @xmath229 which is @xmath230 at the end of the simulation for @xmath231 and @xmath143 ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) - large enough to upscatter most of the photons by a factor of 2 in energy and populate the high - energy tail of the photon spectrum .",
    "the considerably large value of compton - y parameter accounts for the upscattering of photons near @xmath8 to the high energy power - law region of the photon spectrum .      in this subsection",
    ", we discuss the simulation results in figure [ fig7 ] which were performed at @xmath3 and different values of @xmath232 for two different combinations of @xmath43 and @xmath45 .",
    "the number of electrons @xmath10 is kept constant for the simulations and @xmath233 is varied .",
    "we find that the electrons are hotter and the photon spectrum is shallower for smaller @xmath165 for both combinations of @xmath43 and @xmath45 considered in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "rewriting equation [ eqn14 ] using equation [ eqn7 ] and the fact that @xmath234 , @xmath235 thus , for a given @xmath43 , @xmath45 and @xmath128 , the electrons can not transfer enough energy to the photons to populate the higher energy power - law tail for larger @xmath165 . as a result ,",
    "the photon spectrum falls down faster at higher energies for larger values of @xmath165 .",
    "our simulations show that the photon spectrum is significantly affected by the choice of @xmath165 and it is important to perform the simulations with realistic values of @xmath171 .",
    "for all three values of @xmath165 we have more photons just above the peak photon energy as compared to previous simulations ( @xcite ) , which is due to smaller @xmath128 resulting in slower cooling of the electrons by the photons .",
    "we studied photospheric emission for grb prompt emission using a mc code with photon to electron number ratio @xmath171 , which is close to the expected value for a typical grb if the radiation efficiency is @xmath236 .",
    "our objective was to find out whether photospheric emission can explain the observed non - thermal low ( @xmath237 ) and high - energy ( @xmath238 ) spectrum of grb prompt emission .",
    "for all our simulations , we considered comptonization of seed photons with synchrotron spectrum in fast cooling regime .",
    "the electrons are continuously heated by the mono - energetic protons as the electrons interact with the protons ( e - p ) and other electrons ( e - e ) through coulomb interaction . in all our simulations",
    ", we also consider the energy change for electrons , photons and protons due to the adiabatic expansion of the jet .",
    "we find that the output photon spectrum exhibits a power - law extending upto @xmath122 kev from @xmath128 for the parametric space of initial electron energy ( @xmath43 ) , initial proton energy ( @xmath45 ) and initial optical depth ( @xmath1 ) that we consider in this work .",
    "we find that the output photon spectrum becomes shallower below @xmath128 as the initial optical depth @xmath1 increases .",
    "the output spectrum displays @xmath4 below @xmath128 for @xmath239 which is in agreement with the observed low - energy spectrum @xmath237 of the prompt emission .",
    "this is expected as photons get scattered by electrons different number of times before escaping out of the photosphere as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the flattening of the output photon spectrum below @xmath128 for large @xmath1 is independent of the choice of seed photon spectrum .",
    "we find that the peak energy and shape of the output photon spectrum is also determined by the peak energy @xmath128 of the seed photon spectrum .",
    "the peak energy in the output spectrum reduces by a factor @xmath240 compared to the seed spectrum because of adiabatic cooling of photons .",
    "as expected , the photon spectrum is broader around the peak energy for smaller @xmath128 because the photons are less energetic in the jet - comoving frame and can cool the electrons more slowly resulting in more scatterings .",
    "we track the electrons and the protons to study the effect of coulomb ( e - p and e - e ) interaction on the electron and proton energies and the output photon spectrum .",
    "we find that the electron energies are slightly elevated in the presence of coulomb interaction and the protons cool down considerably by the end of the simulation due to adiabatic expansion of the jet for the optical depths that we consider .",
    "the presence of coulomb interaction does not affect @xmath128 and the shape of the output photon spectrum ( both below and above @xmath8 ) in general .",
    "we evaluate @xmath47 at equilibrium due to ic and e - p interactions and find that compton - y parameter @xmath124 at the end of the simulation - which is large enough to populate the high - energy power - law tail of the photon spectrum .",
    "we also performed simulations for different @xmath165 and found that the photon spectrum becomes shallower above @xmath128 and does not exhibit power - law tail at high energies for smaller @xmath165 .",
    "this shows the importance of performing simulations with realistic @xmath165 and thus radiation efficiency @xmath241 .",
    "we find that the comptonization of seed photons with synchrotron spectrum in fast cooling regime can not explain the high energy power - law dependence ( @xmath238 ) and the peak energy of the observed grb prompt emission spectrum .",
    "however , @xmath237 for the photon spectrum below @xmath8 can be successfully explained using fast cooling synchrotron seed photon spectrum at large optical depths ( @xmath242 ) .",
