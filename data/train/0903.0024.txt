    "in recent years , ultra - relativistic high energy heavy ion collisions ( hics ) experiments , such as sps / cern ( @xmath2 gev ) and rhic / bnl ( @xmath3 gev ) , have been aimed to search for the new form of matter , which is composed of deconfinement free quarks and gluons , and thus called quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite .",
    "lattice - qcd calculation predicts that the phase transition between hadronic and qgp phases at vanishing baryon chemical potential @xmath4 is crossover transition whereas at higher @xmath4 the transition may become first - order @xcite .",
    "however , there are many uncertainties for lattice - qcd or model calculation to determine the first - order phase transition boundary as well as the location of corresponding end point , the so - called qcd critical point ( qcp ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the location and even the existence of the qcp are still open questions .",
    "the uncertainty of theoretical calculation drives us to explore the properties of hot qcd matter at higher net baryon density and find experimental evidence of the qcp .",
    "recently , several experimental programs have planed to search for the qcp , such as the energy scan program of rhic / bnl ( @xmath5 gev ) @xcite , the light ion program of na61 experiment at sps / cern ( @xmath6 gev ) @xcite and also the cbm experiment at fair / gsi ( @xmath7 gev ) @xcite .",
    "many experimental observables have been also proposed to be the qcp signatures , such as dynamical fluctuations in @xmath8 ratio @xcite , two experimental observables correlation @xcite , high order moment of transverse momentum @xcite , _",
    "etc._.    in the hydrodynamical description of relativistic heavy ion collisions , the expansion of the central fireball should be regarded as isentropic for the negligible entropy production in the latter evolution , which can be represented as entropy density @xmath9 to baryon density @xmath10 ratio ( @xmath11 ) to be constant @xcite .",
    "a trajectory with @xmath12 for a given colliding system on the qcd phase diagram is called isentropic trajectory . recently ,",
    "the critical singular properties of qcp have been implemented in equation of state ( eos ) for hydrodynamical description of hics @xcite by asakawa , _",
    "et al._. they pointed out that when the isentropic trajectory passes through the vicinity of the qcp , it may be deformed - the so - called `` qcp focusing effect '' @xcite .",
    "they also argued that the qcp focusing effect may result in an observable anomaly in the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio @xcite , which can be employed as a robust signature of the qcp .",
    "however , whether the focusing effect can effectively result in an observable anomaly in the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio has not been worked out yet ; neither has the corresponding mechanism . in this letter",
    ", we will formulate the qcp focusing effect on the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio and apply the urqmd and therminator model to calculate the dependence patterns for three gedanken focused isentropic trajectories with different focusing degrees on the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the urqmd model @xcite used here is based on the quark , di - quark , string and hadronic degrees of freedom and relativistic boltzmann transport dynamics .",
    "it includes 50 different baryon species(nucleon , hyperon and their resonances up to 2.11 gev ) and 25 different meson species .",
    "it is usually used to describe the freeze - out and breakup of the fireball produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions into hadrons .",
    "the model has successfully been applied to reproduce the experimental results from sis / gsi to sps / cern energies @xcite .",
    "the therminator model @xcite is a monte - carlo event generator designed for studying of particle production in relativistic heavy ion collisions from sps to lhc energies .",
    "it implements thermal models of particle production with single freeze out .",
    "the input parameters are those thermodynamical parameters at freeze out , such as temperature @xmath13 , baryon chemical potential @xmath4 ,",
    "_ etc._. [ introduction ]",
    "to quantitatively describe the qcp focusing effect , three gedanken isentropic trajectories with different focusing degrees , passing through the common qcp and chemical freeze out point are constructed on the ( @xmath14 ) plane and respectively labeled as trajectory 1 , 2 and 3 in fig.1 .",
    "the location of the qcp ( @xmath15)=(550,149 ) mev chosen here is the same as the ref .",
    "@xcite , and the chemical freeze out point ( @xmath16)=(440,145 ) mev is the statistical model fit result to the data of pb+pb 40a gev fixed target reactions at sps / cern @xcite .",
    "besides the start and end points , three other ( @xmath14 ) points are also sampled for every trajectory .",
    "as the actual evolution time scale of the isentropic trajectory on the qcd phase diagram is unknown , the normalized time is used and defined by the normalized path length , @xmath17 . for each isentropic trajectory , the @xmath18 represents the path length along the trajectory from the considered point to the qcp and @xmath19 is the length along the trajectory from the chemical freeze out point to qcp .",
    "the colliding system is evolving from the qcp along the isentropic trajectory to the chemical freeze out point and assumed to be thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "then , the @xmath4 and @xmath13 of every sampling point are used as the input thermodynamical parameters for therminator model to calculate the corresponding antiproton and proton numbers along the corresponding isentropic trajectory on qcd phase diagram .",
    "the normalized time dependence of the antiproton and proton numbers at the sampled points for the three gedanken isentropic trajectories are respectively shown in fig.2 , in which the dash lines are the corresponding 3rd - order polynomial fitting results .",
    "it is found in fig.2 that qcp focusing effect results in a sharp decrease of proton number and a non - monotonous increase of antiproton number along the focused isentropic trajectory .",
    "we can also see large discrepancy among the antiproton numbers of the three trajectories , whereas there is little discrepancy for the proton number .",
    "this means the antiproton is much more sensitive to the focusing degree than proton . in fig .",
    "3 , the time evolution of @xmath1 ratio along the three gedanken isentropic trajectories and the corresponding 3rd - order polynomial fitting dash lines are shown .",
    "the antiproton to proton number ratio ( @xmath1 ) increases monotonously from qcp ( @xmath20 ) to chemical freeze out point ( @xmath21 ) , which can be simply explained as the decreasing value of @xmath22 along each focused isentropic trajectory @xcite .",
    "although we have obtained three gedanken focused isentropic trajectories , the quantitative description of the qcp focusing effect on @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio and also the corresponding mechanism are still ambiguous . in qualitative analysis , particles with large @xmath0",
    "would be emitted earlier from the fireball created in hics , since the mean free path generally grows with increasing hadron momentum and becomes comparable with the fireball size @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 , the transverse velocity ( @xmath0 ) dependences of the average emission time ( @xmath23 ) for antiproton and proton in pb+pb 40 agev fixed target reactions are calculated by urqmd .",
    "it is implied that the antiproton and proton , which are dynamically emitted from the fireball , would show strong @xmath24 anti - correlation during the cooling down of the colliding system .",
    "the general @xmath24 anti - correlation pattern can not be reproduced by hydrodynamic inspired model for their particular particle freeze out mechanism .",
    "the significant increase of @xmath1 ratio with the normalized time @xmath25 shown in fig .",
    "3 , together with the strong @xmath0-@xmath25 anti - correlation indicates the experimental observable , @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio , should be enhanced in the lower @xmath0 region and suppressed in the higher @xmath0 region @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the qcp focusing effect on @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio is based on two simple assumptions : one is that the numbers of antiproton and proton evolve independently along the isentropic trajectories and the other is that the numbers of antiproton and proton emitted at time @xmath25 are proportional to their corresponding total number ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) .",
    "the two assumptions can be formulated as : @xmath28 @xmath29 , where the @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the two - dimensional @xmath24 distributions of the antiproton and proton , respectively .",
    "the two @xmath24 distributions indicate antiproton and proton are emitted from the colliding system with a finite probability for certain emission time @xmath25 and transverse velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the two unknown constant coefficients .",
    "in addition to equ.(1 ) and ( 2 ) , we also have the boundary condition : @xmath34 @xmath35 , which means the numbers of antiproton and proton at chemical freeze out point ( @xmath21 ) are equal to their corresponding sum of emitted numbers along the isentropic trajectory .",
    "the two constants @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be determined by performing integral over the normalized time @xmath25 on both sides of equ .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , respectively as : @xmath36 @xmath37 we introduce @xmath38 and @xmath39 as the numbers of antiproton and proton emitted at time @xmath25 along the isentropic trajectory , respectively .",
    "then , with equ .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , we have : @xmath40 @xmath41 it is found that the @xmath38 and @xmath39 are only determined by the normalized time @xmath25 dependence of antiproton and proton numbers along the isentropic trajectory , respectively , which are calculated by therminator model in fig .",
    "2 .     dependence of the transverse velocity @xmath0 calculated by urqmd for pb+pb 40 agev fixed target reactions at mid - rapidity .",
    "]    the experimental observable , @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio , can be calculated as : @xmath42 , which depends strongly on the @xmath24 distributions of antiproton and proton .",
    "although , the two @xmath24 distributions are not exactly known , the anti - correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath25 is well known .    to quantitatively analyze and set the benchmark for the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio with the qcp focusing effect , we extract the @xmath24 distributions of antiproton ( @xmath43 ) and proton ( @xmath44 ) from the pb+pb 40 agev fixed target reactions implemented by urqmd .",
    "the emission time @xmath25 here has been normalized . with the two @xmath24 distributions , the corresponding @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio",
    "is calculated by equ.(9 ) and shown in fig.5 .",
    "as qgp phase transition and qcp have not been implemented in urqmd model , the monotonous increase pattern with @xmath0 up to 0.7 in fig .",
    "5 is thought to be normal and without suffering from qcp focusing effect .",
    "dependence of @xmath1 ratio calculated by urqmd for pb+pb 40 agev fixed target reactions at mid - rapidity . ]    in order to obtain the anomalous @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio resulted from the qcp focusing effects , we modify the @xmath24 distributions of antiproton ( @xmath43 ) and proton ( @xmath44 ) , which has been calculated by urqmd model .",
    "the @xmath25 distributions in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 are replaced by the distributions @xmath38 and @xmath39 derived from equ.(7 ) and ( 8) , respectively .",
    "for the three gedanken focused isentropic trajectories in fig .",
    "1 , the resulted @xmath24 distributions for antiproton and proton , which have been introduced in qcp focusing effect , can be calculated as :    @xmath45    @xmath46    consequently , the qcp focusing effect has been implemented in the @xmath24 distributions for both antiproton and proton through the equ.(10 ) and ( 11 ) , respectively .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio with qcp focusing effect can be also calculated by equ.(9 ) with the modified @xmath24 distributions ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) .",
    "the results for the three focused gedanken isentropic trajectories on the qcd phase diagram are illustrated in fig .",
    "6 . comparing the results of urqmd calculation in fig . 5 and the results with qcp focusing effect in fig . 6",
    ", we find that they demonstrate completely opposite dependence patterns , which indicates the qcp focusing effect could actually result in an observable anomaly in the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio . in fig.6 , it is also noticed that the higher focused degree of isentropic trajectory leads to the steeper @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio .",
    "obviously , the anomalous @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio can be employed as a sensitive qcp signature .",
    "dependence of @xmath1 ratio for three gedanken isentropic trajectories .",
    "the solid lines are used to guide eyes . ]",
    "we have formulated the qcp focusing effect on @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio with some reasonable assumptions .",
    "the quantitative calculations for the three gedanken focused isentropic trajectories have been made with urqmd and therminator models .",
    "in fact , the real @xmath24 correlation pattern for antiproton and proton of a colliding system in hics can not be measured experimentally , which directly determines the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio .",
    "therefore , the urqmd model is used to provide @xmath24 correlation pattern and the therminator model is applied to calculate the normalized time dependence of the antiproton and proton numbers along the isentropic trajectories .",
    "then , the anomalous @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratios have been obtained for three gedanken focused isentropic trajectories , which means the qcp focusing effect can efficiently result in an observable anomaly in the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio .",
    "we argue that when the isentropic trajectory of the colliding system on the qcd phase diagram is passing through the vicinity of the qcp and deformed by qcp focusing effect , an observable anomaly in @xmath0 dependence of @xmath1 ratio , enhanced in low @xmath0 and suppressed in high @xmath0 region , will be observed . this anomaly may also be reflected in the @xmath49 spectra of antiproton and/or proton .",
    "the existing antiproton @xmath49 spectrum for pb+pb 40 agev fixed target collisions measured by na49 collaboration at sps / cern exhibits a steeper exponential slope @xcite .",
    "finally , we propose that it may be helpful to extract the anomalous structures from the @xmath49 spectrum of antiproton and/or proton by performing inverse laplace transform on the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the excitation function of structure variable , which should be predefined , can be useful to search for the qcp .",
