    "supersymmetry - breaking effects in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) are usually introduced explicitly as soft terms in the lagrangian . in a more complete theory ,",
    "supersymmetry is expected to be an exact local symmetry of the lagrangian which is spontaneously broken in the vacuum state in a sector of particles distinct from the mssm .",
    "there are two main proposals for how supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the mssm particles .",
    "historically , the more popular approach has been that supersymmetry breaking occurs at a scale @xmath0 gev and is communicated to the mssm dominantly by gravitational interactions . in this case ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is naturally the lightest neutralino @xmath1 .",
    "one of the virtues of this gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario is that a neutralino lsp can easily have the correct relic density to make up the cold dark matter with a cosmologically acceptable density .",
    "recently , there has been a resurgence of interest in the idea @xcite that supersymmetry - breaking effects are communicated to the mssm by the ordinary @xmath2 gauge interactions rather than gravity .",
    "this gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) scenario allows the ultimate supersymmetry - breaking order parameter @xmath3 to be much smaller than @xmath4 gev , perhaps even as small as @xmath5 gev or so , with the important implication that the gravitino @xmath6 is the lsp .",
    "the spin-@xmath7 gravitino absorbs the would - be goldstino of supersymmetry breaking as its longitudinal ( helicity @xmath8 ) components by the super - higgs mechanism , obtaining a mass @xmath9 where @xmath10 gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the gravitino inherits the non - gravitational interactions of the goldstino it has absorbed @xcite .",
    "this means that the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) can decay into its standard model partner and a gravitino with a characteristic decay length which can be less than of order 100 microns ( for @xmath11 gev ) or more than a kilometer ( for @xmath12 gev ) , or anything in between .",
    "this leads to many intriguing phenomenological possibilities which are unique to models of low - energy supersymmetry breaking [ 3 - 10 ] . for kinematical purposes ,",
    "the gravitino is essentially massless",
    ". the perhaps surprising relevance of a light gravitino for collider physics can be traced to the fact that the interactions of the longitudinal components of the gravitino are the same as those of the goldstino it has absorbed , and are proportional to @xmath13 ( or equivalently to @xmath14 ) in the light gravitino ( small @xmath15 ) limit @xcite .    in a large class of models with low - energy supersymmetry breaking",

    "the sign of @xmath21 depends on the sign of @xmath22 ( the superpotential higgs mass parameter ) through the off - diagonal term @xmath23 in the stau ( mass)@xmath24 matrix .",
    "this term typically dominates over the contribution from the soft trilinear scalar couplings in gmsb models , because the latter are very small at the messenger scale and because the effects of renormalization group running are usually not very large . for this reason ,",

    "only when @xmath34 gets very close to @xmath111 and/or @xmath211 can deviations exceed a few percent ( larger deviations are often in the direction of shifting the maximum of the @xmath38 or @xmath22 distribution towards slightly lower values , and vice - versa for the tau distribution ) .    more generally , in fig .  [ figdist](b ) , we illustrate the scaling using particular gmsb models from ref .",
    "@xcite that are relevant for the slepton three - body decays .",
    "we show the logarithmic and normalized electron energy distributions for four models ( thin lines ) compared to that of fig .",
    "[ figdist](a ) ( thick line ) .",
    "these four gmsb models have , respectively from left to right : @xmath212 , 89.8 , 63.7 , 69.7 gev ;  @xmath213 , 0.30 , 2.2 , 9.7 gev ;  @xmath214 ; @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 ;  @xmath218 , 95.0 , 64.6 , 75.1 gev ;  @xmath219 , 0.97 , 0.50 , 0.73 ; so that  @xmath220 @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and 237 ev  and  @xmath224 , @xmath225 , 5.47 and 171 ev [ using eq .",
    "( [ fullwidth ] ) and the corresponding equation for @xmath226 .",
    "they were picked in such a way as to probe various regions of the gmsb parameter space allowed for models within reach of lep2 .",
    "[ figdist](b ) shows that , in addition to slight deformations of the shapes of distributions due to small @xmath227 and/or large @xmath211 , values of @xmath228 can produce further small changes ( as evident from the two models more on the right with larger @xmath142 ) .",
    "the total deviations are , however , still small enough to allow a model - independent generalization of the discussion above concerning the detectability of the three - body decay .",
    "thus , it is expected that in most models the @xmath38 or @xmath22 will typically get more than half of the available energy , and hence the chance for detection increases straightforwardly with increasing @xmath142 .",
    "however , the decay length of the @xmath43 or @xmath44 will drop in correspondence with the total width increase , diminishing the chance of detecting a kink in the charged track . alternatively , for smaller @xmath142 , detection of the @xmath38 or @xmath22 ( and also the @xmath52 kink ) is more difficult , but of course the decay length is longer , increasing the chance that a kink can be seen .",
    "at lep2 , the process @xmath229 is the most kinematically - favored one for supersymmetry discovery in the stau nlsp scenario . if the decay @xmath72 takes place outside the detector ( or inside the detector but with a decay length longer than a few cm ) , then the stau tracks ( or decay kinks ) may be directly identified @xcite .",
    "if @xmath43 and @xmath44 can also be pair - produced , then the decays @xmath230 studied here can come into play , leading to additional events @xmath231 or @xmath232 or @xmath233 .",
    "note that when @xmath234 is larger than @xmath235 , the same - sign @xmath236 signals are suppressed compared to the opposite sign signals @xmath237 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was observed that the @xmath238 production cross section in these models is often significantly larger than that for @xmath239 , because of the interference effects of a heavier neutralino in the @xmath240-channel diagrams contributing to the latter process .",
    "therefore , one may expect more @xmath241 events than @xmath242 events , although this is not guaranteed .",
    "we have seen that if @xmath142 is smaller than order 1 gev , then the identification of soft leptons and taus may be challenging .",
    "however , we noted that in just this case the decay length of @xmath52 may well be macroscopic , leading to another avenue for discovery .",
    "also , since @xmath52 decays isotropically in the rest frame , and pair - produced sleptons generally do not have a considerable preference for the beam direction , we expect the probability for the final particles to be lost down the beam pipe to be small .",
    "this is especially true for @xmath243 , where the production does not receive contributions from @xmath240-channel neutralino exchange ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "if @xmath29 decays to @xmath244 with a decay length shorter than a few cm , then @xmath29 decay kinks will be difficult to observe directly at lep2 .",
    "instead , @xmath245 production leads only to a signal @xmath246 .",
    "this has a large background from @xmath247 production , but it may be possible to defeat the backgrounds with polar angle cuts @xcite .",
    "if @xmath52 pair production is accessible and @xmath248 dominates over @xmath230 , then the model will behave essentially like a slepton co - nlsp model , even though the mass ordering is naively that of a stau nlsp model .",
    "we have seen that this might occur even for a multi - gev @xmath142 .",
    "then the most likely discovery process may be @xmath249 , as discussed in ref .",
    "if the decay @xmath72 is prompt but the decays @xmath197 discussed here still manage to dominate over @xmath250 , then one can have events @xmath251 or @xmath252 or @xmath253 , with the leptons in parentheses being much softer .",
    "the first two should have very small backgrounds , as will the last one if the soft leptons are seen .",
    "at the fermilab tevatron collider , sleptons can be pair - produced directly or produced in the decays of charginos and neutralinos .",
    "if the decays @xmath72 and @xmath197 both take place over macroscopic lengths , then @xmath254 or @xmath255 can lead to events with leptons + jets + heavy charged particle tracks ( possibly with decay kinks ) .",
    "it is important to realize that both the production cross - section and the detection efficiency for such events will likely be greater than for the direct production processes @xmath256 and @xmath257 .",
    "if @xmath72 has a macroscopic decay length but the decays @xmath230 studied here are prompt , then there will be some events with extra soft leptons and taus .",
    "however , the latter may be difficult to detect , and furthermore one may expect that @xmath258 and @xmath259 will decay preferentially to @xmath260 and @xmath261 ( or @xmath262 and @xmath263 ) rather than through @xmath52 .",
    "similar statements apply for the cern large hadron collider , except that the most important source of sleptons may well be from cascade decays of gluinos and squarks ; in some circumstances those decays may be more likely to contain @xmath52 channels .    in this paper",
    "we have studied the three - body decays of selectrons and smuons in the case that the neutralino is heavier . in gmsb models and other models with a gravitino lsp",
    ", these decays may play a key role in collider phenomenology .",
    "in particular , we found that the corresponding decay lengths may be macroscopic and the competition with the decays @xmath264 may be non - trivial .",
    "we also found that the electron or muon in the final state of the three body decay usually carries more than half of the available energy in the rest frame of the decaying slepton .",
