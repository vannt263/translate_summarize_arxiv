    "the question of compactness of the faddeev @xcite or the equivalent alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) @xcite momentum space integral equations for three charged particles is related to the analytical properties of their kernels . in the preceding paper @xcite ,",
    "henceforth called i , we have investigated the analytical behavior of the nondiagonal kernels of the equations for three particles interacting via coulomb - like pair potentials , rewritten in the form of effective - two - body ags equations pertaining to all binary ( so - called @xmath0 ) reaction amplitudes @xcite . under the assumption that the charges of all three particles are of the same sign , i.e.",
    ", that all coulomb potentials are repulsive , their nondiagonal kernels were found to possess only integrable singularities .    in this second part",
    "we investigate the singularity structure of the corresponding diagonal kernels , again restricting ourselves to purely repulsive coulomb interactions .",
    "it will be shown that the only nonintegrable singularity ( i ) occurs on the energy shell , and ( ii ) coincides with the singularity found by veselova ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) below the breakup threshold and by alt and sandhas ( @xcite and references therein ) for all energies .",
    "as is well known , this singularity can be singled out and inverted explicitly @xcite .",
    "all other singularities of the diagonal kernels , including all off - the - energy - shell singularities , turn out to be integrable .",
    "consequently , these equations can be recast in a form such that the kernels of the resultant equations become compact after a few interations , for all energies .",
    "this completes the investigation of the analytical properties of effective - two - body ags equations for @xmath0 reactions of three particles with charges of equal sign above the three - body threshold .",
    "it is worth mentioning that from the proofs also follows that , as soon as charges with opposite sign are involved , the kernels do , indeed , develop severe singularities which preclude application of standard methods of integral equations theory .",
    "this agrees with the findings in the integro - differential approach @xcite .",
