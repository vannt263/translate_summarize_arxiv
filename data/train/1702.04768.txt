    "the problem we address in this paper is the  numerical integration of the  second order time - dependent linear equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and primes denote time - derivatives .",
    "it has many practical applications , for example , in periodically variable systems such as quadrupole mass filter and  quadrupole devices , @xcite , microelectromechanical systems @xcite , in bose ",
    "einstein condensates , spatially linear electric fields , dynamic buckling of structures , electrons in crystal lattices , waves in periodic media , etc .",
    "( see @xcite and  references therein ) . in these cases",
    "the  matrix @xmath3 is usually time periodic with period @xmath4 ( ( [ hill ] ) is then an example of a matrix hill equation ) and of moderately large size @xmath5 .",
    "parametric resonances can occur so that it is very important to  know the  stability regions in terms of the  parameters of the  system .",
    "another important example of this type is the linear time - dependent wave equation @xmath6 equipped with initial conditions @xmath7 , and  @xmath8 .",
    "once discretized in space in a bounded region , [ eq.se ] also leads to [ hill ] .    when the  dimension @xmath5 of [ hill ] is relatively small , the  numerical computation of its fundamental matrix solution for one period ( usually repeatedly many times for different values of the  parameters of the  system ) is feasible and allows one to  analyse the stability of the  configuration . in this case",
    "numerical schemes that involve matrix  matrix products can be used . however , when [ hill ] results from a semidiscretized pde like [ eq.se ] then @xmath9 , and so only numerical schemes involving matrix ",
    "vector products are suitable .    taking these considerations into account , in this work we present two classes of numerical schemes : one that involves matrix  matrix products showing a  high performance for the  computation of the  fundamental matrix solution for one period , and another class involving matrix  vector products , addressed for the numerical treatment of pdes .",
    "equation ( [ hill ] ) can be written as a  first order system by introducing new variables @xmath10 as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the solution of [ firstordersystem ] evolves through a  linear transformation ( evolution operator or fundamental matrix solution ) given by @xmath14 . in the  usual case",
    "in which @xmath15 is a  real and symmetric @xmath16 matrix valued function ( @xmath17 ) then @xmath18 is a  symplectic transformation .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath18 occur in reciprocal pairs , say @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the  complex conjugate of @xmath21 . as a  result , for stable systems ,",
    "all of the  eigenvalues must lie on the  unit circle ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this is a  very important property that is not preserved in general by standard numerical integrators .",
    "thus , one can be forced to  use very small time steps to  avoid the undesirable numerical instabilities or asymptotic stabilities arising from this fact , with the resulting degradation in the efficiency of the algorithms .",
    "the solution of the non - autonomous [ firstordersystem ] can not be written in general in closed form . nevertheless , we can always formally write it as a  single exponential by using the  magnus expansion @xcite , @xmath22 where @xmath23 satisfies a ( highly nonlinear ) differential equation . although different approximations can be found in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , they involve the computation of nested commutators of @xmath24 , evaluated at different times , and so for many problems may be computationally expensive    for this reason , here we consider two different strategies starting from the formal solution provided by the magnus expansion .",
    "the first leads us to optimised methods specifically addressed to problems defined by ( [ hill ] ) when matrix  matrix products are feasible ; to these we call _ magnus - decomposition methods_. the second strategy allows us to build optimised methods when only matrix  vector products are suitable .",

    "splitting methods_.    in _ magnus - decomposition methods _ , in particular , we approximate @xmath25 by a  composition of simpler symplectic maps that for the problem at hand are considerably faster to  compute .",
    "as an illustration , a 4th - order method within this family contains only one costly matrix exponential and this exponential is cheaply approximated by a symplectic approximation of order @xmath26 leading to an scheme given by the composition : @xmath27 } = \\begin{pmatrix } i & 0 \\\\ d_{3}^{[4,q ] } & i \\end{pmatrix }      \\begin{pmatrix } 0 & d_{2}^{[4,q ] } \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix }      \\begin{pmatrix } i & 0 \\\\ d_{1}^{[4,q ] } & i \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 } , \\",

    "starting from the well know magnus expansion for linear time - dependent differential equations , in this work we have presented two families of time - integrators especially designed for the second order linear system ( [ hill ] ) . both share with the exact solution relevant qualitative properties ( in particular , its symplectic character ) and thus provide an accurate description of the system over long time intervals , due to their favourable error propagation , but they differ in significant aspects .",
    "whereas magnus - decomposition methods are addressed to problems with small to moderate dimensions where the numerical computation of matrix  matrix products ( and thus the fundamental matrix ) is feasible , magnus  splitting methods are advantageous when the dimension of the system is exceedingly high , as is the case when ( [ hill ] ) results from a linear time - dependent wave equation previously discretized in space . the numerical experiments reported here clearly illustrate this difference : whereas the first family performs more efficiently on the scalar mathieu equation and a low - dimensional and oscillatory matrix hill equation , it is the second class of integrators which shows a better behaviour on a discretised trapped wave equation , where algorithms based only in matrix - vector products are advisable .",
    "magnus - decomposition methods can be considered as an adaptation of the schemes presented in @xcite involving appropriate truncated expansions of the otherwise computationally costly matrix exponentials initially present in them and useful combinations of matrices .",
    "splitting methods , on the other hand , belong to the class of integrators analysed in @xcite : taking as a starting point an efficient splitting method for the autonomous case , the scheme is formed by averaging the matrix @xmath3 at each step ( with different weights ) .",
    "the new coefficients are obtained by solving the additional order conditions arising from the time - dependency .",
    "compared with the general case , the number of order conditions is considerably reduced , which allows to get new schemes within this family in a rather straightforward way .",
