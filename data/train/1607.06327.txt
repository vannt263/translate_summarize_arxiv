    "recently , an apparently exotic mesonic state , the so - called @xmath0 , was observed by the d0 collaboration in the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the extracted mass and width are @xmath6 mev and @xmath7 mev , respectively , and the preferred spin - parity is @xmath8 .",
    "this state belongs to the so - called exotic @xmath9 states  @xcite because of its exotic nature , with at least four valence quark flavors @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "it has been suggested to be either a diquark - diquark state  @xcite , a tetraquark state  @xcite , a triangular singularity  @xcite , or a molecular state  @xcite .",
    "although initially many theoretical works found a state consistent with the @xmath0 , the difficulty to accommodate such a narrow structure with a relatively low mass has been recognized by burns _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and guo _ et al . _",
    "a recent study in the chiral quark model showed that neither diquark - antidiquark nor meson - meson structures supports the existence of the @xmath0  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lowest - lying tetraquark @xmath12-wave state was found to be 150 mev higher than the @xmath0 .",
    "experimentally , the preliminary result of the lhcb collaboration did not confirm the existence of the @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "one of the possible explanations for the @xmath0 is that it is a meson - meson molecular state  @xcite .",
    "this is a natural analog of the @xmath1 in the charm sector , which has been studied rather extensively and can be described as a molecular state of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "although the strangeness and isospin of these two states are different , this naive analogy inspires one to understand the @xmath0 as a @xmath3 and @xmath4 molecular state . in ref",
    "@xcite , using the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) scattering lengths  @xcite to fix the relevant low energy constants of the unitarized chiral perturbation theory ( uchpt ) , one found that the @xmath16 emerges naturally . from the scattering lengths shown in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , one can infer their counterparts in the bottom sector using ( approximate ) heavy quark symmetry .",
    "the scattering lengths show that the interaction in the @xmath3@xmath4 channel is rather weak and does not support the existence of a low - lying resonance or bound state , consistent with the explicit search on the second riemann sheet  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if one assumes a molecular picture for the @xmath0 , heavy quark symmetry then predicts that the charmed partner of the @xmath0 should be located around @xmath17 gev .",

    "the unusual size of the cutoff points clearly to the presence of missing channels , contributions of other sources , or to the existence of `` non - molecular '' components , such as a sizable tetraquark configuration . as a result",
    ", it was concluded that a pure molecular state , dynamically generated by the unitary loops , is disfavored .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached in a later study utilizing @xmath19-wave coupled channel dynamics in the uchpt  @xcite .",
    "it should be pointed out that irrespective of the nature of the @xmath0 , the uchpt of ref .",
    "@xcite provides a good description of the d0 experimental data .",
    "therefore , it is important to further test its implication .    in principle ,",
    "lqcd simulations provide a model - independent way to study the properties of hadrons from first principles using quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "the lscher method is the de facto standard in the case of single channel two - body elastic scattering  @xcite , by relating discrete energy levels obtained in lqcd simulations to the scattering phase shifts in infinite spacetime .",
    "it has been generalized to the case of multichannel scattering  @xcite and applied to study the coupled @xmath20 and @xmath21 channels  @xcite and the coupled @xmath22 and @xmath23 channels  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the jlich and valencia group has developed a new effective approach to connect the lqcd discrete energy levels with the physical phase shifts ( energies ) by keeping the full relativistic two - body propagator , from which the lscher formulation can be derived  @xcite .",
    "this new approach has been applied to study finite volume effects in the meson - baryon interaction in the jlich model  @xcite , the @xmath24 and @xmath25 interaction  @xcite , the pion - kaon scattering  @xcite , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 interaction  @xcite , the @xmath28 interaction  @xcite , the @xmath29 interaction  @xcite , the @xmath30 interaction  @xcite , and lately the @xmath31 and @xmath32 interaction and the @xmath33  @xcite . in the present work",

    "3 we point out the inconsistency between the coexistence of the @xmath0 and the @xmath34 in view of the lqcd scattering lengths of @xmath2 and its coupled chanels .",

    "@xcite , followed by a short summary in sec .",
    "the uchpt has two basic building blocks , a kernel potential provided by chiral perturbation theory and a unitarization procedure .",
    "the kernel potentials constrained by chiral symmetry and other relevant symmetries , such as heavy quark symmetry in the present case , are standard in most cases , while the unitarization procedures can differ in their treatment of left - hand cuts or higher order effects , although they all satisfy two - body elastic unitarity .    the kernel potential employed in refs .",
    "@xcite has the following form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) channel , @xmath12 is the invariant mass squared of the system , @xmath37 is the pseudoscalar meson decay constant in the chiral limit , @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the masses of @xmath41 and @xmath42 mesons . the coefficients @xmath43 are @xmath44 , @xmath45 .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the so - called bethe - salpeter equation method is adopted to unitarize the above - obtained chiral kernel . in the context of the uchpt ,",
    "the integral bethe - salpeter equation is often simplified and approximated to be an algebraic equation with the use of the on - shell approximation .",

    "@xcite , the minimal subtraction scheme is modified to explicitly conserve heavy quark symmetry and the chiral power counting . confined to either the charm sector or the bottom sector alone , the modified subtraction scheme , termed as the heavy - quark - symmetry ( hqs ) inspired scheme , is equivalent to the @xmath61 scheme , but it can link both sectors in a way that conserves heavy quark symmetry up to order @xmath62 , with @xmath63 the chiral limit of the heavy hadron mass",
    ". the loop function of the hqs scheme is related with that of the @xmath61 scheme via @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the average mass of the goldstone bosons , @xmath66 is the chiral limit value of the bottom ( charm ) meson masses and @xmath67 is the subtraction constant .",
    "in the hqs scheme , the subtraction constant determined in the charm ( bottom ) sector is the same as that determined in the bottom ( charm ) sector , while this is not the case for the subtraction constant of the @xmath61 scheme .",

    "<S> the recent observation of the @xmath0 by the d0 collaboration has aroused a lot of interest both theoretically and experimentally . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we first point out the inconsistency between the existence of the @xmath0 and that of the @xmath1 , particularly from the perspective of the lattice qcd scattering lengths of @xmath2 and its coupled channels . </S>",
    "<S> we then turn to the unitarized chiral description of the d0 data and its implications . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the weinberg compositeness condition indicates that the @xmath0 can not be a ( dominant ) @xmath3 and @xmath4 molecular state . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we compute the discrete energy levels of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 system in finite volume using the unitarized chiral perturbation theory . the comparison with the latest lattice qcd simulations supports the picture where the @xmath3 and @xmath4 interaction is weak , which disfavors the existence of the @xmath0 . </S>"
