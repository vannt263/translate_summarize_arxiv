    "weak nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) interaction has recently been formulated in the framework of effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite .",

    "the weak potentials obtained from eft have been subsequently applied to the calculation of pv observables in the two nucleon systems @xcite , and the results demonstrate the adequacy of perturbative scheme of the eft for the description of weak @xmath0 interaction .",
    "about 40 years ago , danilov suggested the parametrization of the parity mixing due to the weak @xmath0 interaction in terms of five pv low energy constants @xcite , and the idea was applied to the calculation of pv observables in the few - nucleon systems @xcite . in this work , we will consider pv observables in the neutron - proton capture at threshold , where energy scale or momentum transfer is much small compared to the pion mass . at this small scale pion",
    "can be treated as a heavy degree of freedom . if pions are treated as heavy degrees , we can integrate out the pion from the theory , and then we obtain a pionless theory where interactions are described in terms of only two - nucleon contact terms .",
    "pionless eft for the weak @xmath0 interaction in ref .",
    "@xcite is parametrized by seven independent pv low energy constants ( lecs ) at the leading order ( lo ) , but recently it has been shown that two terms are redundant and thus five terms are independent in practice @xcite .",
    "thus , inasmuch as the number of unknown weak parameters is concerned , danilov s idea in the past gives the same parametrization to the pionless eft at leading order .",
    "parity - violating vertex in the pionless theory in @xcite consists of the multiplication of two two - nucleon fields : one in @xmath1 state and the other in @xmath2 state . given a rule to transform a two - nucleon state to the corresponding dibaryon field",
    ", it is straightforward to obtain the pv lagrangian that describes the weak @xmath0 interaction in terms of pv dibaryon - nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath3 ) or dibaryon - dibaryon vertices . introducing a dibaryon field for the deuteron , the effective range contribution ( @xmath4 ) to the deuteron propagator",
    "is taken into account up to infinite order , and it consequently makes the convergence of the theory improved compared to the pionless eft that does not have dibaryon fields . since scattering lengths and effective ranges in the @xmath1 state are unusually large , resummation of effective range contribution to infinite order in dibaryon formalism is especially useful for the two - nucleon systems dominated by @xmath1 state . in this work ,",
    "we obtain the pv lagrangian with dibaryon fields by transforming the two - nucleon @xmath1 states to the corresponding dibaryon fields , while describing the @xmath2 states in terms of the two - nucleon fields .",
    "weak @xmath0 interaction is described by the pv @xmath3 vertices , which have unknown weak coupling constants .",
    "we plug the lagrangians in the calculation of the pv polarization ( @xmath5 ) in @xmath6 at threshold .",
    "pv polarization has been calculated with the weak one - meson - exchange ( ome ) potentials ( conventionally referred to as ddh potential @xcite ) and with various strong interaction models @xcite .",
    "the results in @xcite show strong dependence on the strong interaction model , and are dominated by the @xmath7- and @xmath8-meson exchange terms in the ddh potential . in the eft , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and",
    "heavier mesons are integrated out because their masses are very large scales at low - energy few - body processes , and their contributions are embedded in the @xmath0 contact terms . since the pv polarization in @xmath6 is dominated by the heavy mesons in the ome picture for the weak @xmath0 interaction , if it is considered in the eft , only the contact terms are relevant and thus the pionless eft may be one of the most favorable frameworks for the investigation . result for @xmath5",

    "eft has been employed partially in the calculation of pv asymmetry in @xmath127 with the pionful theory @xcite .",

    "@xcite , meson - exchange currents ( mecs ) are obtained up to an order , but the strong interaction is described by a phenomenological model , a@xmath121 , and weak interaction by the ddh potential . in refs .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , weak potential is expanded up to a given order , while em operator is accounted for with siegert theorem and strong interaction described with a@xmath121 .",
    "calculation where eft is partially employed is called hybrid calculation .",
    "current conservation for a given pv potential and the corresponding mec has been used as a crucial criterion in the calculation of the anapole moment of the deuteron @xcite .",
    "since the current conservation can be satisfied when a potential and corresponding mecs are taken into account consistently , consistent expansion of strong potentials , weak potentials and transition operators is an important requirement in the eft .",
    "it has been pointed out that the orders of the interactions and transition operators in the hybrid calculations are in serious disagreement @xcite . in our calculation with pionless deft , the order of a diagram is obtained by counting the strong , weak and em vertices altogether , and we truncate the expansion at a given order . therefore , our calculation satisfies the consistency requirement mentioned above . on the other hand ,",
    "results from the conventional calculation , where strong interaction is accounted with modern potential , weak interaction with ddh potential , and em operator with siegert theorem , have provided benchmarks to both experiment and theory , but the physical criteria such as current conservation have seldom been checked carefully .",
    "it is important to understand the uncertainty due to the order mismatch in the conventional and hybrid calculations , and investigation along this direction with either pionful or pionless theories is an important future work .",
    "there are five weak lecs in the pionless theory and therefore we need at least five data for the pv observables .",
    "@xmath5 may be one of them .",
    "recently pv longitudinal asymmetries in @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 scattering have been calculated with a pionless eft @xcite .",
    "longitudinal asymmetry in @xmath128 depends on three pv coupling constants @xmath131 , and thus the measurement at 13.6 mev provides a relation for them .",
    "pv asymmetry in @xmath127 and deuteron anapole moment have been calculated with the pionless deft @xcite , and the results turn out to be dominated by @xmath76 .",
    "measurement of the pv asymmetry at sns is expected to play an important role in determining the value of weak lec @xmath76 ( or the weak pion - nucleon coupling constant @xmath132 ) . turning to the possibilities in the three body system",
    ", one can find a recent calculation of the weak effect in the spin rotation in @xmath133 scattering @xcite .",
    "the authors employed ddh potential for the weak interaction , and obtained a result dominated by @xmath132 .",
    "though the asymmetry in @xmath134 and spin rotation in @xmath133 are observables independent to each other , they are exclusively dependent on @xmath132 ( or equivalently @xmath76 ) , so the measurements of the observables will provide a check for the consistency of @xmath132 . in order to determine the remaining weak lecs in the pionless eft , we need calculations and measurements for as many observables as possible .    among many possible pv observables in the few - body systems , an observable that draws our interest is the pv asymmetry in @xmath135 at threshold .",
    "it has been measured at ill @xcite , and the reported result reads @xmath136 theoretical calculation of @xmath137 in ref .",
    "@xcite adopted ddh potential for the weak interaction , and examined the dependence on the strong interaction models such as de tourreil - sprung ( ts ) and reid soft core ( rsc ) .",
    "the results are interesting in some aspects .",
    "first , dependence on the strong interaction model is non - negligible ; ts model gives a result @xmath138 while rsc gives @xmath139 .",
    "second , isoscalar , isovector and isotensor pv interactions in the ddh potential give similar contributions to @xmath140 , e.g. @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 , respectively , with the ts model .",
    "this means that contributions from @xmath144 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 exchanges in the pv potential are similar to each other .",
    "dependence on the strong model and the non - negligible contribution from the heavy mesons are the features common with the pv polarization in @xmath6 . in this problem again , therefore , pionless eft will serve us with a most natural and systematic way to parametrize the parity - mixing in the few - body system due to weak nuclear force .",
    "parity violation in the three- and few - body systems can show us the effects that are not accessible in the two - body systems .",
    "for instance , strong @xmath145 force can give non - negligible correction to the one- and two - body contributions to the pv observables .",
    "there has been no consideration on the weak three - body force , but we have recently obtained non - zero component of weak @xmath145 force in a preliminary calculation @xcite .",
    "two- and three - body pv meson - exchange currents are also important issues .",
    "we expect that the eft will play a crucial role in extending our understanding of the nuclear weak force in few - body systems .",
