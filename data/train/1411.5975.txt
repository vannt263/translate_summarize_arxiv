    "some of the issues concerning the light curves of stripped  envelope supernovae might be clarified with more investigations of this type to determine the ejecta mass by independent means .",
    "even within the simple framework we employ here there are refinements that would make a quantitative difference .",
    "the  constants \" @xmath139 , c , and the  3/5 \" that relates the mean velocity to the photospheric velocity are functions of the density distribution and could be explored for a variety of assumed power ",
    "law exponents @xcite .",
    "the nature of positron trapping could be explored more thoroughly . in the future ,",
    "better  sampled light curves from peak to tail would be valuable , and the most accurate estimates of the observed uvoir quasi  bolometric light curve should be employed .",
    "we do not think these aspects would make a qualitative difference compared to the effects of asymmetry , ionization , and recombination we discuss here .",
    "clocchiatti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) emphasized the depths of the conundrum presented by events with similar late ",
    "time tails but different spectral types and different photospheric velocities . from equation ( [ t01 ] ) , two events with the same value of @xmath258 must have a ( nearly ) constant value of @xmath259 .",
    "the similar late ",
    "time light curves would then require some very unexpected correlation between the kinetic energy and ejecta mass and with the the mean , and hence presumably photospheric , velocity .",
    "now , as then , the problem posed by the similar light curves and different velocities remains a challenge .",
