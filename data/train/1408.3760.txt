    "at ambient pressures the element arsenic is a semimetal with the rhombohedral @xmath1-as or a7 crystal structure ( space group _ r@xmath2 m _ ) . under applied pressure arsenic",
    "undergoes a series of structural phase transitions ,  @xcite the first of which occurs at approximately 28  gpa yielding the metallic simple - cubic ( sc ) structure ( space group _",
    "pm@xmath2 m _ ) .",
    "the change in the electronic structure of arsenic across this semimetal to metal phase transition is described most naturally using the fermi surface . in the a7 phase",
    ", arsenic is known to have a very unusual fermi surface , consisting of six lobes connected by six long thin cylinders or `` necks '' .",
    "this fermi surface is today still depicted as it was by lin and falicov  @xcite in 1966an artist s rendition  it is a famous image that is often used to describe the complexity that a fermi surface may exhibit .",
    "first - principles calculations on the very dense grids required to resolve the fine details of the fermi surface of arsenic are computationally expensive even with contemporary computing resources . here",
    "we demonstrate that the method of wannier interpolation  @xcite achieves the same accuracy far more inexpensively .",
    "in this study we use wannier interpolation to investigate the pressure dependence of the fermi surface and density of states ( dos ) of arsenic , in particular as it experiences the a7  @xmath0  sc semimetal to metal phase transition .",
    "wannier interpolation of the band structure is based on the use of maximally - localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) ,  @xcite which act in the spirit of `` tight - binding '' as a set of spatially - localized orbitals , allowing calculations to be performed with the accuracy of first principles simulations but at low computational cost . indeed , arsenic provides us with a beautifully simple demonstration of the power of wannier interpolation  it is an ideal testing ground for the use of this technique to study phase transitions involving a metal . in an earlier work we used density - functional theory ( dft ) to determine the transition pressure of the a7  @xmath0  sc phase transition of arsenic .",
    "@xcite the investigation consisted of performing relaxations of the two - atom unit cell subjected to pressures over the range of .",
    "the study was focused primarily on the a7  @xmath0  sc semimetal to metal phase transition . that work enabled us to address a long - standing question as to whether experimental results for the transition pressure obtained by  @xcite were correct over those of kikegawa and iwasaki ,  @xcite with our results supporting the findings of the former .",
    "it further allowed us to explain the wide range of theoretical values for the transition pressure that can be found in the literature  the spread of values is due to the difficulty of adequately sampling the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "we discovered that high - quality results required extensive convergence testing with respect to bz sampling and amount of smearing used . in particular , we found that in order to ensure convergence and reliability of results when studying phase transitions involving a metal , dense bz sampling grids are essential .",
    "@xcite we thus begin by using wannier interpolation to determine the fermi surface of arsenic at 0  gpa .",
    "we inspect closely the finest features of the electron and hole fermi surfaces at ambient pressures and make a quantitative comparison of our results with those available in the literature . building on the results obtained from the relaxations performed in our earlier study ,  @xcite we then use wannier interpolation to investigate the pressure dependence of the fermi surface of arsenic , and in particular to study exactly how it evolves through the a7  @xmath0  sc transition .",
    "finally , we use wannier interpolation to investigate the dos of arsenic over a range of different pressures . in our earlier study",
    ", we found that converging our geometry optimizations in the vicinity of the a7  @xmath0  sc phase transition was rather more difficult than expected .",
    "@xcite we will see that this is due to the rapid change of the dos around the fermi level across the transition .",
    "consequently , high levels of convergence are required in order to calculate the transition pressure accurately .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  ii outlines important technical aspects of the methodology , and sec .",
    "iii deals with the computational details of our calculations . in secs .",
    "iv  vii , we present and discuss our results : we reveal the actual fermi surface of uncompressed arsenic ",
    "the features thereof are compared to results of theory and experiment that exist in the literature ; we study the pressure dependence of the fermi surface of arsenic , with a view to observing it as it undergoes the a7  @xmath0  sc structural phase transition ; we calculate the wannier - interpolated dos of arsenic in the a7 and sc phases , and we present the pressure dependence of the dos of arsenic in the immediate vicinity of the a7  @xmath0  sc transition ; we conclude with a brief discussion .",
    "a conventional electronic - structure calculation yields a set of bloch states describing the low - lying band structure of a particular system in its ground state .",
    "a set of ( generalized ) wannier functions  @xcite ( wfs ) can be constructed from these bloch states in order to be able to describe the system in real space , with the wfs acting as a basis set of localized orbitals .",
    "the method of wannier interpolation  @xcite is based on the use of a _",
    "unique _ set of wannier functions , the so - called `` maximally - localized wannier functions '' ,  @xcite which serve as an `` exact tight - binding '' basis for the target system .",
    "prescriptions due to marzari and vanderbilt  @xcite and souza , marzari and vanderbilt  @xcite allow the determination of this unique set of wannier functions ",
    "the former in the case of a set of isolated bands and the latter extended to the case of a set of entangled bands  by requiring the resulting wfs to exhibit minimum spread .",
    "wannier interpolation is a simple and widely applicable scheme that incorporates the idea of a tight - binding model with the accuracy of _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "the technique is ideal for the evaluation of quantities that require a very dense sampling of the bz .",
    "in particular , it should be very useful for the study of metallic systems as it enables a sampling of the fermi surface to _ ab initio _ accuracy but with little associated cost .",
    "here we are concerned with finding the eigenvalues of the one - electron effective hamiltonian at arbitrary @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the band index . however",
    ", this interpolation procedure can be extended to the calculation of other quantities of interest  the eigenvalues of any periodic one - electron operator can be determined in a similar fashion .",
    "@xcite      to accelerate the convergence of singularities in the dos , we apply a state - dependent broadening scheme as follows . within the wannier interpolation method",
    ", we have the ability to vary the smearing of the occupancies according to the band gradients @xmath6 , as the gradients can be computed efficiently at no additional cost .",
    "the state - dependent smearing width @xmath7 is set to  @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a dimensionless constant , of value 0.2 in this study .",
    "this state - dependent broadening scheme is termed `` adaptive smearing ''  @xcite and it enables highly resolved doss , especially when combined with the method of cold smearing .",
    "we build on the findings of our earlier studies of arsenic ,  @xcite in which structural relaxations were performed on the two - atom rhombohedral unit cell subjected to a range of pressures .",
    "these geometry optimizations resulted in a series of pressure - dependent configurations , characterized by the lattice parameters which are described in the discussion of the unit cell of arsenic found in the material supplementary to this study .",
    "@xcite for each configuration ( each pressure ) , we repeat exactly the same procedure .",
    "the computational details are as follows . for each pressure investigated",
    ", we first obtain the bloch states self - consistently using the density - functional - based pwscf code  @xcite in the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "we use a scalar - relativistic , norm - conserving pseudopotential generated using the `` atomic '' code ( by a. dal corso , supplied with the quantum espresso distribution  @xcite ) to describe the core - valence interaction of arsenic . the pseudopotential core radii",
    "are as follows : 1.16  @xmath10 for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 states , and 1.22  @xmath10 for the @xmath13 states , anticipating that we will need to allow for @xmath14-states at higher pressures .",
    "we perform the self - consistent calculation on our two - atom unit cell of arsenic using a 25@xmath1525@xmath1525 monkhorst - pack grid , which includes the @xmath16 point .",
    "a kinetic energy cutoff of 750  ev is used for the plane - wave expansion of the valence wavefunctions .",
    "a convergence threshold of @xmath17  ev is set for the minimization of the total energy , and a cold smearing  @xcite of 0.27  ev is used .",
    "once the ground state charge density of the system has been determined , using the pwscf code we then perform a non - self - consistent calculation in order to obtain a reference ( _ ab initio _ ) band structure against which the wannier - interpolated band structure can be compared .    to calculate the wfs , the self - consistent potential is frozen and a non - self - consistent calculation is performed in order to discretize the bloch states over a uniform mesh of 8@xmath158@xmath158 .",
    "the strong localization of the mlwfs in real space , in addition to the generally - accepted exponential fall - off of the wfs , ensures that a grid of this size is sufficient for our needs .",
    "@xcite ( in this work we adopt the convention used in ref .   of using the symbol @xmath18 to denote grid points that belong to the mesh upon which the bloch states have been stored .",
    "this is in order to distinguish these specific from arbitrary sites , labeled , at which the values are obtained through interpolation . ) the bloch states are thus stored on a relatively coarse _ ab initio _ grid .",
    "we have determined that we must use 9 wfs per atom of the unit cell in order to ensure that we can capture the character of the bands at higher pressures  this point is elaborated upon in the supplementary material .",
    "@xcite thus we must construct 18 wfs and with this in mind , we calculate the first 30 bands at each .",
    "the 18 wfs can then be constructed from these 30 bands according to the disentanglement procedure prescribed by souza , marzari and vanderbilt .",
    "@xcite this is performed using the wannier90 code .",
    "@xcite we obtain highly converged doss across the range of pressures studied using a 400@xmath15400@xmath15400 interpolation ( ) mesh .",
    "although we use the ` pwscf ` code in the lda , the configurations ( the lattice parameters defining the structure of arsenic at each pressure ) used in this study were obtained from calculations using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation  @xcite ( abbreviated here as gga - pbe ) for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "@xcite we have confirmed that when using wannier interpolation to study the gga - pbe configurations , it makes no significant difference whether the ground state potential has been set up using an lda functional or a gga functional .",
