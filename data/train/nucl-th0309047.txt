    "for a long time low energy hadron - hadron interactions , in particular the @xmath0 interaction , have been studied in terms of meson exchange models employing baryon and meson degrees of freedom .",
    "such models have achieved a good description of the empirical data .",
    "a common undesirable feature in all meson exchange models is the necessity of a ( semi)phenomenological parametrization of the short - range part of the interaction .",
    "however , since the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) there is the hope that the short - range part of the hadron - hadron interaction can be derived from first principles .",
    "however , because of complications due to the nonperturbative nature of the qcd interactions at low energies , the use of models is a practical necessity for making progress in this direction .",
    "there is a great variety of quark models that can describe with reasonable success single - hadron properties .",
    "therefore , there arises the natural question of to what extent a model which gives a good hadron structure is , at the same time , able to describe the hadron - hadron interaction and in a larger context , intermediate energy nucleus - nucleus collisions . in this respect , in the recent past several studies of the @xmath0 interaction have employed the non - relativistic quark model , _ a la _ isgur and karl , which is one of the most successful quark models for hadron structure .",
    "the main ingredient of such calculations is the one - gluon exchange interaction .",
    "the results are encouraging as far as the very short - range part is concerned which is reflected in the successful description of @xmath0 scattering s - wave phase shifts . for the intermediate - range part progress on the spin - orbit problem in the @xmath0 system was made by including , in addition to the one - gluon - exchange interaction , a scalar - isoscalar meson coupled to quarks in a chirally symmetric way @xcite .",
    "more recently , calculations in the @xmath1 system became an important approach , due to the fact that one - pion exchange is absent and contributions from @xmath2 exchange seem to be weaker than in the @xmath0 system .",
    "the quark - gluon exchange in the @xmath1 system has been studied by barnes and swanson @xcite , silvestre - brac and collaborators @xcite-@xcite and hadjimichef , haidenbauer and krein @xcite . in summary , these studies lead to some general questions such as : where do we place the frontier between quark - gluon physics and effective theories ? to what extent the underlying quark - gluon physics , studied at lower energies in the context of hadron interactions , can play a role in the complex dynamics related to heavy ion collisions ? can we have a description in which one could smoothly pass from high energy physics to an effective low energy representation ?",
    "of course to answer these questions would represent a major step in hadron physics . in a more limited context",
    "it would be interesting to extend the quark - gluon exchange approach to a many - body @xmath0 system such as a nucleus and study in heavy ion collisions .",
    "little is known about hadronic matter at finite temperatures and densities other than the nuclear ground state density @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "unfortunately , there exists , at the moment , no theoretical model that consistently provides an understanding of the reaction dynamics of heavy ion collisions over the entire energy range .",
    "it is believed that the quark - gluon plasma can be observed in high energy collisions , where temperature and density are large enough to deconfine quarks and gluons . at lower energies heavy ion collisions",
    "have be used to investigate the appearance of collective effects and to probe the conditions related to the nuclear equation of state @xcite .",
    "theoretically these studies have been performed by numerical simulations in many models .",
    "for example , transverse and longitudinal collective flow as well as azimuthal distributions provides complementary information which can be used to evaluate the details of microscopic models such as boltzmann equation @xcite , vlasov - uehling - uhlenbeck @xcite and quantum molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the main ingredients in these models is the nucleon - nucleon cross - section , where it turns out that many observables are very sensitive to its value .",
    "it is usual to assume as an input to simulations the free @xmath0 cross - section .",
    "however recent studies on collective flow have indicated a density dependent in - medium reduction from its value in free space @xcite .    in this paper we shall extend the study of ref .",
    "@xcite and develop this aspect considering quark - gluon exchange corrections to the nucleon - nucleon cross - section in the vuu equation as a first approach .",
    "the procedure we shall use , in order to introduce these corrections , is known as the fock - tani formalism ( ftf ) , which is a method that employs a second quantization formalism to problems where the internal degrees of freedom of composite particles can not validly be neglected .",
    "the vlasov - uehling - uhlenbeck ( vuu ) equation is a differential equation for the classical one - body phase - space distribution function @xmath5 corresponding to the classical limit of the wigner function .",
    "the vuu equation takes a familiar form @xmath6",
    "\\label{vuu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a stands for @xmath8 and correspondingly for the other terms.the two - body interactions are divided in a short - range and long - range part .",
    "the short - range interactions are regarded as corresponding to the hard - core binary collisions .",
    "the long - range interactions are assumed to be given by a potential with origin in a density - dependent mean field , formed by the nuclear matter , around the particle in use .",
    "the potential @xmath9 may be written in terms of the modified skyrme forces @xcite u= + ( ) ^. [ skyrme ] the conditions used to fix the three parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are : @xmath13 the ground state energy must assume the correct value for nuclear matter ( -16 mev ) ; @xmath14 the ground state at @xmath15 has to be a minimum ; @xmath16 the compression modulus @xmath17 should be some hundred mev",
    ". the magnitude of @xmath17 can be obtained from the measure of the radius of the giant monopole resonances in nuclei .    in order to include the quark corrections to the vuu equation",
    "we shall briefly outline the main features of the fock - tani approach to baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "one starts with the fock space representation of the system , using creation and annihilation operators of the elementary hadron constituents particles .",
    "a one - baryon state , with momentum @xmath18 , internal energy @xmath19 , spin projection @xmath20 and isospin projection @xmath21 , can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the vacuum ( no quarks ) state and @xmath24 is the baryon creation operator @xmath25 we use the convention that a sum over repeated indices is implied .",
    "the indices @xmath26 denote the spatial , spin - flavor , and color coordinates of the i - th quark .",
    "the baryon bound - state wave functions are taken orthonormalized . using the quark relations and orthonormality condition for @xmath27 above",
    ", one can show the following anti - commutation relations for the baryon operators : @xmath28 where @xmath29    observe that the baryon operators @xmath30 do not satisfy the canonical anti - commutation relations for fermions . the extra term @xmath31 appearing in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) results from the composite nature of the baryons .",
    "the presence of this term complicates the application of the usual field theoretic techniques to the @xmath30 and @xmath24 operators , making these operators inconvenient dynamical variables .",
    "the change of representation of the ftf is implemented by means of a unitary transformation @xmath32 , such that the composite particle operators @xmath30 and @xmath33 are re - described by ",
    "ideal \" baryon operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 . by definition , the ideal baryon operators satisfy canonical anti - commutation relations : @xmath36 and are kinematically independent from the quark operators @xmath37 .",

    "( [ 8 ] ) as : @xmath40b_{\\gamma}\\;.   \\label{ft12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] given this , the evaluation of the transformed quark operators is straightforward",
    ". full details of the derivation of the iterative solution is presented elsewhere  @xcite ; here we simply present the final results .",
    "the @xmath39 operator is built in such a way that a _ single _ real - baryon state @xmath41 is transformed into a _",
    "single _ ideal - baryon state @xmath42 : @xmath43    in order to discuss nucleon - nucleon scattering , one needs to specify the general form of the microscopic quark hamiltonian . for our purposes here",
    ", the microscopic hamiltonian can be written in terms of the quark operators as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the kinetic energy and @xmath46 is the quark - quark interaction .",
    "note that this is a general expression for @xmath47 , which in this form , a variety of quark - model hamiltonians used in the literature can be written . in our calculation",
    "we shall use , for @xmath46 , the spin - spin hyperfine component of the perturbative one gluon interaction v_qq = - * s*_i_j f^a_i f^a_j , [ vss ] where @xmath48 are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "there is a considerable literature related to free @xmath0 scattering with quark - interchange and in many of these models the quark - quark potential is much more elaborated than the potential in eq .",
    "( [ vss ] ) ( including coulomb , spin - orbit , tensor , confinement terms and eventually meson coupling to quarks ) . the lesson taken from all of these works is that the dominant term for the short - range repulsion is basically the spin - spin term from the one gluon exchange potential .",
    "its strong influence is seen , for example , in the @xmath49 partial - wave where repulsion increases when @xmath50 is increased . in these models",

    "this behavior also happens in the @xmath1 system @xcite . in this perspective",
    "a very first step in order to include quark corrections to the vuu equation would be to use the dominant term in quark - quark interaction to simulate the short - range hard - core and verify its effect on the observables .",

    "<S> in recent years a tentative description of the short - range part of hadron interactions with constituent quark interchange has been developed providing an alternative approach to meson physics . </S>",
    "<S> quark interchange plays a role , for example , in the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) phase - shifts and cross - section . in heavy ion collision simulations at intermediate energies </S>",
    "<S> one of the main features is the @xmath0 cross - section in the collisional term , where in most cases it is an input adjusted to the free space value . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the quark degrees of freedom to the @xmath0 cross - section in the vlasov - uehling - uhlenbeck ( vuu ) model and explore the possibility that these effects appear in the observables at lower energies . </S>"
