    "tetracyclines ( tc ) are a set of compounds used in human therapy against a broad - spectrum of microbial agents since 1947 .",
    "they can be classified as low cost drugs with small side - effects being largely used by food industry and for therapy in animals and plants @xcite .",
    "tc present activity against gram - positive and gram - negative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria , mycrobacterium and several protozoan parasites @xcite .",
    "non - antibacterial effects as anti - inflammatory , immunosuppressive @xcite , antioxidant @xcite and anticancer @xcite are also attributed to them .",
    "the excessive use of tc during years helped resistant bacteria proliferation , limiting then their clinical use .",
    "more than 30 tc resistance determinants have been described @xcite and several different tc resistance determinants have been identified in e. coli @xcite .",
    "this emergence of resistant pathogens is becoming an increasingly important problem and it motivates the search for new tc variations and derivatives @xcite .",
    "tc can be divided into two classes , the bacteriostatic typical tc and atypical tc , which are bactericidal and they exert their effects by promoting bacterial autolysis . most probably due to their different modes of action , atypical tc have been shown to exert activity against some tc resistant bacteria @xcite .",
    "the chemistry of tc in solution is quite complicated @xcite due to their ability to adopt different conformations , protonation states , and tautomeric forms , depending on the conditions investigated @xcite .",
    "tc and its analogues undergo complex formation with a variety of the metal cations present in biological fluids @xcite and this affects their chemical as well as conformational equilibrium in solutions .",
    "theoretical and experimental investigations have contributed to the understanding of the interaction of tc with biological medium and their mode of action @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations have also been applied to investigations of new applications for old , new and hypothetical tc derivatives @xcite .    in this work we present an investigation of electronic and quantum features for a series of tc ( figure [ fig1 ] , table [ tab1 ] ) for which the biological activity against _",
    "e. coli _ is known and also to new compounds @xcite .",
    "our results showed that it is possible to directly correlate some quantum electronic descriptors to tc biological activity .",
    "this information is then used in the design of new compounds .",
    "basic structure of tetracycline.,width=302 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , it is interesting to note the role played by substituents in the biological behavior of the new set of tetraciclines .",
    "according to our qualitative analysis the main substitution requirement for biological activity is the presence of nh@xmath2 or no@xmath2 or dialkylamino groups at c7 and/or c9 . even for",
    "non - active derivative 13 ( table i ) the presence of these substituents classifies as active new compounds 81 - 84 and 87 - 90 ( table viii ) . despite the whole molecular skeleton composed of 4 fused rings and the integrity of the ring a",
    ", the rest of the molecule including position c5 and c6 just plays minor role on the biological activity of tetracyclines .",
    "in this work we applied the eim methodology in the classification of activity of 14 derivatives of the tetracicline and in the predictive classification of the activity of 90 hypothetical new derivatives .",
    "our results showed that the eim results are not method dependent indicating that the classification of activity of tetraciclines is reproducible for different semiempirical methods . in comparison with conventional physicochemical descriptors the importance of eim descriptors",
    "is reinforced by pca and ann methodologies .",
    "the rules constructed with eim , pca and ann methods reproduced the experimental data with 100% , 96% and 100% of accuracy , respectivelly . for the new 90 derivatives proposed eim and ann are in good agreement with a percentage of 93% consistent classification . these results",
    "add to increasing data of eim studies indicating the pure quantum electronic indices can be reliably used to classify the biological activity of large number of different classes of materials .",
    "we hope the present study estimulate further experimental studies for tetracyclines in order to try to produce new antibiotic compounds .",
