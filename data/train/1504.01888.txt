    "the eruption of prominences and magnetic flux ropes from the sun has important implications in view of space weather manifestations .",
    "these eruptions are frequently associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections .",
    "it is widely accepted that magnetic reconnection is the most fundamental process responsible for the changes in the topology of magnetic fields , as well as the rapid conversion of stored magnetic energy into thermal and kinetic energy of plasma and particles during solar eruptive events ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "solar flares occur in active regions consisting of sunspot groups in the photosphere enveloped by large overlying coronal loops that essentially represent a closed magnetic field configuration associated with sunspots .",
    "the spectrum of energy released from a flare shows that there is a precursor phase , which is generally marked by a gradual increase in thermal radiation mainly in the form of small enhancement of soft x - ray ( sxr ) flux @xcite .",
    "it is followed by the impulsive phase lasting for a few seconds to tens of minutes , comprising of energy release in the form of @xmath3-ray , hard x - ray ( hxr ) , extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) , and microwave ( mw ) emissions .",
    "after the impulsive phase thermal radiation dominates . in this phase , h@xmath4 and sxr emission",
    "attain a maximum level followed by a gradual decline in the intensity . to understand",
    "the diversity of phenomena during eruptive flares , the standard flare model ( also known as cshkp model ) has been proposed which incorporates the pioneering works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in the standard flare model ,",
    "the initial driver of the flare process is a rising prominence ( also called filament when viewed on the solar disk ) formed in the chromosphere along the magnetic polarity inversion line of solar active regions . in a simplistic picture",
    ", one can imagine the structure of a bipolar magnetic configuration in terms of an inner region , called the core field , and the outer region , called the envelope field .",
    "the core fields are rooted close to the neutral line while the envelope fields are rooted away from it .",
    "many observations have confirmed that core fields can usually be traced by a filament .",
    "the standard flare model recognizes that in the early stages of a large eruptive flare , the core fields containing the prominence erupt which would result in the stretching of the envelope fields . with the evolution of the eruption process",
    ", the stretched field lines reclose via magnetic reconnection beneath the erupting filament .",
    "the extensive solar observations over the last decades , mainly from space borne telescopes , have revealed several important features of the multi - wavelength flare that have further strengthened the standard flare model and provided concrete observational inputs to understand the role of magnetic reconnection toward plasma heating and particle acceleration .",
    "these features include : occurrence of hard x - ray ( hxr ) footpoint ( fp ) and looptop ( lt ) sources , formation of h@xmath4 flare ribbons at the opposite polarity regions , rising arcade of the intense soft x - ray ( sxr ) loops , plasmoid ejections , upward motion of hxr lt source , and increasing separation of h@xmath4 flare ribbons along with hxr fp sources ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    according to the standard flare model , the filament activation is a crucial part of the flare process .",
    "observations reveal several categories of the filament activation , viz . full , partial and failed @xcite .",
    "the full or partial eruptions are followed by flares and cmes while the failed eruptions characterize those situations when a filament undergoes a successful activation in the beginning but finally fails to erupt from the corona .",
    "full and partial eruption of filaments have been reported in numerous observations . on the other hand ,",
    "failed eruptions are observed less frequently and therefore form a less studied topic in solar physics .",
    "their study provide an opportunity to investigate the interaction between the erupted plasma and magnetic fields with the overlying coronal loops ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the rate of decrease of overlying magnetic fields with their heights is considered to be a crucial factor that determines whether an erupting prominence will lead to a successful eruption or confine within the overlying coronal region @xcite . @xcite and @xcite studied a failed eruption of a filament during which multiple hxr sources were observed from the coronal as well as footpoint locations .",
    "the examination of the locations of coronal hxr sources with respect to the dynamical evolution of the filament is of high interest toward a better understanding of the energy release scenario in solar eruptions .    sometimes prior to the filament activation and associated flares , small localized brightenings",
    "are observed to occur in the active region close to the site of the main flare @xcite .",
    "such localized pre - flare brightenings are frequently observed as enhanced x - ray flux at low energies ( e.g. , goes light curves ) before the impulsive phase .",
    "it has been recognized that filaments undergo slow yet important changes during the pre - flare phase @xcite",
    ". some studies also show crucial evidence of non - thermal x - ray emission during the early activation phase of solar eruptions @xcite .",
    "these investigations have provided clues to understand the processes occurring in the active region that eventually lead to filament destabilization and thus triggering the impulsive energy release .",
    "it is important to note that , while investigating the pre - flare phase , one should also carefully probe the state of overlying coronal loops besides the core region containing the filament .    in this study , we present observations of an m6.2 flare and its associated pre - flare activities observed in active region noaa 10646 on 2004 july 14 between 04:30 ut and 06:00 ut that are associated with the confined eruption of a filament ( sol2004 - 07 - 14 ) . during the pre - flare phase ,",
    "we observe contraction of overlying coronal loops as well as multiple brightenings at its core region where the main flare occurred .",
    "the impulsive phase of the m6.2 flare is characterized by multiple non - thermal peaks during which a rising prominence showed an initial acceleration for @xmath14 minutes , then slowed down and finally stopped by overlying loops .",
    "several aspects of this event related to the confinement of the prominence eruption and associated flare emissions have been analyzed in previous studies @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that this flare can be well described by a quadrupole model .",
    "this study showed that the failed eruption of the flux rope caused stretching in the overlying loop system .",
    "as a consequence of this interaction , the overlying loops were observed to oscillate radially with an initial amplitude of 9520 km , a period of 377 s and an exponential damping time of 500 s. this flare is one of three events analyzed in @xcite in which they found a close relation among the euv brightenings observed at the footpoints of overlying loop systems , a decrease in velocity of the eruption , and episodes of hardening of the hxr spectra . from these observations",
    ", they concluded that the interaction of the erupting structure with overlying loops was strong enough to heat the high loops which then cooled down in @xmath130 - 60 minute to become visible in the euv range .",
    "here we revisit sol2004 - 07 - 14 and provide a comprehensive analysis of the intriguing flaring and eruptive activities from its prolonged pre - flare phase to the decay of the event .",
    "we obtained significant additional information about the state of overlying coronal loops , the flaring core region and energy release processes during the flare s impulsive phase . on the whole ,",
    "this event was remarkable in several aspects .",
    "( 1 ) we note significant pre - flare activity which is manifested in the form of large - scale contraction of overlying coronal loops .",
    "( 2 ) accompanying with the large - scale loop contraction , sequential brightening in the core region was observed which can clearly be recognized as three pre - flare events in the goes x - ray profile .",
    "( 3 ) a drastic increase in the speed of contraction is observed just @xmath55 minute before the onset of the impulsive phase ( i.e. , during third pre - flare event ) .",
    "( 4 ) during the impulsive phase , we observe multiple non - thermal peaks .",
    "the first stage of the impulsive phase marks the transition from signs of the magnetic implosion scenario @xcite to the generally observed expansion of flaring coronal loops and the activation of filament .",
    "the high spatial resolution , continuous sequence of euv images at 171    from the pre - flare phase to the end of the flare provided us with an excellent opportunity to thoroughly examine activities in the core region of the eruption along with the overlying system of coronal loops .",
    "the signatures of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration are inferred from hxr and microwave ( mw ) observations .",
    "we further provide a detailed hxr spectroscopy of the flare to investigate the crucial plasma parameters and flare energetics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ data ] , we provide details of observing instruments and data analysis procedures . for the convenience of readers , an overview of the multi - wavelength observations",
    "are presented in section  [ overview ] .",
    "we provide a detailed multi - wavelength diagnostic of each phase of the eruption in section  [ results ] . in section  [ discuss ] , we discuss and interpret our observations .",
    "the summary of the paper is given in the final section .",
    "in this paper , we present a comprehensive multi - wavelength analysis of the sequence of intriguing activities that occurred in solar active region noaa 10646 on 2004 july 14 between 04:30 ut and 06:00 ut .",
    "transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ; @xcite ) observed the active region noaa 10646 during this whole period at high time cadence ( better than 1 min ) with its euv channel at 171  .",
    "the trace telescope has a field of view of 8@xmath6.5@xmath78@xmath6.5 and a spatial resolution of 1@xmath8 ( 0@xmath8.5 pixel@xmath9 ) .",
    "the trace 171   filter is mainly sensitive to plasmas at a temperature around 1 mk ( fe ix / x ) .",
    "reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ; @xcite ) detected significant activities in noaa 10646 during its continuous observations from 04:30 ut to 05:35 ut .",
    "rhessi observes the full sun with an unprecedented combination of spatial resolution ( as fine as @xmath12@xmath10.3 ) and energy resolution ( 15 kev ) in the energy range of 3 kev to 17 mev . to reconstruct x - ray images ,",
    "we have used the computationally expensive pixon algorithm @xcite which is thought to provide the most accurate image photometry @xcite .",
    "the images are reconstructed by selecting front detector segments 38 ( excluding 7 ) with 20 s integration time .",
    "our analysis involves the identification of x - ray and mw source locations during the dynamical evolution of the filament and coronal loops observed by trace .",
    "however , the pointing information of trace is often not good enough to obtain a correct co - alignment between trace images and imaging data at other wavelengths . for a full disk imager ( such as soho / mdi ; @xcite )",
    ", the solar limb provides a reference that helps in accurate determination of the absolute pointing of the telescope .",
    "moreover , thermal bending of the trace guide telescope also leads to an unknown variation in the pointing of at least a few arcseconds @xcite .",
    "the pointing information of both rhessi and soho is believed to be sufficiently accurate .",
    "therefore , we corrected trace pointing by a cross - correlation alignment between a trace white light ( wl ) and a soho / mdi wl image taken at 04:45:20 ut and 04:47:32 ut respectively using the method described in @xcite .",
    "this method has been found very effective for near - limb events ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we found that the trace pointing was offset by 0@xmath8.8 in the x direction and 2@xmath8.4 in the y direction ( see figure [ pointing ] ) .    in this analysis ,",
    "we include microwave ( mw ) observations by the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ; @xcite ) at 17 ghz and 34 ghz . at these two frequencies norh",
    "has spatial resolutions of 10@xmath8 and 5@xmath8 respectively @xcite .",
    "norh has a sensitivity of at least 1 solar flux unit ( sfu ) at 17 ghz and @xmath13 sfu at 34 ghz",
    ". the normal time resolution of norh is 1 s , but a resolution as good as 50 ms can be used for special projects ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "for the present study we have analyzed norh light curves and images with a temporal cadence of 1 s.",
    "on 2004 july 14 , active region noaa 10646 was situated close to the western limb at heliographic coordinates of n13w64 . in figure [ mdi_hsi ]",
    ", we show a trace white light ( wl ) image overlaid by a soho / mdi line - of - sight ( los ) magnetic field map of noaa 10646 .",
    "we find that the active region consists of a set of sunspot groups with leading and trailing groups having positive and negative magnetic polarities respectively .",
    "the active region displayed a rather dispersed structure of sunspots with well separated magnetic polarities .",
    "the active region noaa 10646 exhibited a set of very intriguing flaring and eruptive activities between 04:30 ut and 06:00 ut which can be nicely followed in goes sxr time profiles shown in figure  [ goes_profile ] . a major flare of class m6.2 occurred in the active region between 05:17 and 06:00 ut .",
    "it is remarkable to observe significant activities in the active region that started several minute before the onset of the m - class flare that continued until the flare s impulsive phase .",
    "the goes light curves ( figure [ goes_profile ] ) clearly recognizes these pre - flare activities in the form of multiple small peaks at @xmath104:41 ut , @xmath105:06 ut and @xmath105:16 ut before the onset of the impulsive phase of flare at @xmath105:17 ut .",
    "thereafter , the flare attains its peak at @xmath105:23 ut and gradually ended by 06:00 ut .",
    "we mark pre - flare goes peaks as i , ii , and iii in figure [ goes_profile ] .",
    "these activities correspond to the localized and discrete brightenings at low - lying loops at the site of the main flare and simultaneous contraction of large overlying coronal loops .",
    "the detailed imaging analysis of x - ray and euv data presented in the next section clearly show that the pre - flare activity corresponds to phases of episodic energy release at the earliest stages of restructuring of magnetic fields .",
    "it is further noteworthy that multiple peaks at pre - flare phases are more pronounced in the high energy goes channel ( i.e. , in 0.54.0   band ) .",
    "based on goes and trace observations , we consider following phases of flare evolution : ( 1 ) pre - flare activity which includes large - scale loop contraction and brightenings in the core region ( 2 ) m6.2 flare which is accompanied with a failed eruption of a filament . here",
    "we note that although the loop contraction proceeds during the whole pre - flare activity , we describe loop contraction and core region brightenings separately in the next section to provide a better clarity on these two phenomena .",
    "we should note that the contraction was observed in higher overlying coronal loops that are spatially separated from the regions of pre - flare brightenings .",
    "it is , however , quite possible that the two phenomena ( localized brightenings and contraction of overlying loop system ) are physically interconnected .    in figure [ mdi_hsi ]",
    ", we further show the locations of a pair of hxr and mw emission centroids observed during the early impulsive phase of m6.2 flare by star ( @xmath11 ) and filled circle ( @xmath12 ) symbols respectively .",
    "it is apparent that the flare occurred close to the neutral line of photospheric magnetic field .",
    "we mark locations of hxr and mw emission centroids as s1 and s2 .",
    "following the main impulsive phase , we note another prominent mw source appeared at a distant location , marked as s3 in figure [ mdi_hsi ] , which does not have any hxr counterpart .",
    "active region noaa 10646 was enveloped by a set of large coronal loops with different orientations which present a peculiar structure of active region corona ( see figure [ loops ] ) .",
    "we have estimated the height of three prominent overlying loop systems ( which are indicated in figure [ loops ] by a , b , and c ) from the source region ( shown by ` @xmath7 ' ) .",
    "the projected height of these three systems of loops were estimated as @xmath192 mm , 88 mm , and 93 mm .",
    "we found significant activities occurring in the coronal as well as source region by examining 171   images available from 04:30 ut onward . from the sequence of euv images ,",
    "it is evident that the higher coronal loops began to collapse from @xmath104:47 ut ( see figures [ pre-2 ] & [ imp_ht ] ; and online movie ) .",
    "we find that only one loop system ` b ' underwent contraction .",
    "this large - scale contraction continued until the impulsive rise of the m6.2 flare at 05:18 ut .",
    "we note some important observational characteristics of the loop contraction .",
    "( 1 ) before and at the beginning of loop contraction ( i.e. , 04:4204:51 ut ) the top of the loop system exhibited intense emission which gives evidence for localized heating in the higher corona ( indicated by the arrow in figure [ pre-2](f ) ) . ( 2 ) from 04:51 ut onward , this loop top brightening started getting dispersed and the brightening mostly dissolves by @xmath105:02 ut .",
    "( 3 ) from @xmath14:54 ut , we observe intermittent brightenings in a set of low - lying loops at the source region besides contraction of higher loops ( figure [ pre-2](h ) ) .    in figure [ imp_ht ] ( a )",
    ", we present a height - time plot of the collapsing coronal loops . due to mingling of several loops which altogether evolve dynamically ,",
    "the estimation of loop height was a tedious exercise .",
    "we took utmost care in distinguishing one of the loop systems undergoing the contraction by carefully identifying its legs .",
    "we find that the loop contraction proceeds with varying speed . in order to compare the phases of loop contraction with the thermal emission from the flaring region , we have also plotted the co - temporal @xmath13 flux profiles in both channels in figure [ imp_ht](b ) .",
    "we find that in terms of contraction speed , the collapsing loop system undergoes three phases of evolution . in the beginning , the loops contract with relatively higher speed of @xmath511  km  s@xmath14 that sustained for @xmath06 minutes .",
    "this is followed by a prolonged phase of @xmath119 minutes during which the contraction slowed down to @xmath15 km s@xmath9 .",
    "as shown in figure [ goes_profile ] , the pre - flare activity is characterized by three episodes of flux enhancement ( marked as i , ii , and iii ) .",
    "we note that the loop contraction continued during all three stages ( figure [ imp_ht ] ) but there is a drastic increase in the speed of contraction from @xmath15 km s@xmath9 to @xmath025  km s@xmath14 at @xmath05:12 ut which mark the third episode of flux enhancement .",
    "the loop contraction halts at 05:18 ut with the beginning of the flare impulsive phase after which the expansion predominates over the implosion .",
    "the sequence of images during the pre - flare phase clearly indicate that the large - scale contraction of euv coronal loops is accompanied by localized brightenings at the core of active region loops . in figure",
    "[ pre-2 ] , we show euv images showing pre - flare activity and mark the three events of goes flux enhancement ( see figure [ goes_profile ] ) as i , ii and iii in panels ( c ) , ( l ) , and ( p ) respectively . here",
    "it is important to note that the core region exhibited pre - flare emission even before the onset of contraction in the form of x - ray ( 612 kev and 1225 kev ) and mw ( 17 ghz and 34 ghz ) emissions which are co - spatial ( figures  [ pre-2](b)-(d ) ) .",
    "however , at this time euv images do not show any significant bright structures associated with x - ray and mw emitting regions . the x - ray and mw",
    "sources in the pre - flare phase clearly indicate distinct events of energy release at the core of active region loops that precede the large - scale contraction of overlying loops .",
    "we observe localized , distinct bright euv sources at the core region from 04:54 ut onward , i.e. , after the initiation of the contraction of the loop system .",
    "the location of euv brightening is shown inside a box in figure  [ pre-2](h ) .",
    "although brightening at three locations were observed in the beginning ( @xmath104:57 ut ) , we can clearly recognize two of the three bright structures as low - lying loops at some later stages ( @xmath105:02 ut ) .",
    "the intensity of bright loops rapidly decreased ( @xmath105:07 ut ) and we observe formation of a relatively large system of low - lying loops thereafter ( i.e. , 05:08 ut onward ) .",
    "in fact three new bright loops formed sequentially which appeared in coincidence for a brief interval ( around 05:12 ut ) .",
    "these three loops are marked as 1 , 2 , and 3 in order of their occurrences .",
    "we also note that the loop1 became very intense in the later stages ( marked in figure [ pre-2](p ) at 05:15:17 ut ) and also lasted till the impulsive phase of m6.2 flare .",
    "the comparison of pre - flare euv brightening with the co - temporal rhessi images clearly reveal x - ray sources at the top of low - lying loops . it is interesting to see that although in euv images , loop1 appeared the most intense , the hxr emission in 1225 kev energy band is essentially associated with loops 2 and 3 .",
    "we further note that mw emission at 17 ghz and 34 ghz is observed in the form of single source that shows clear association with the bright low - lying euv loops ( figure [ pre-2](p ) ) .        in figure [ flux_profile ] , we present the rhessi and norh light curves along with the goes time profiles for the m6.2 flare .",
    "we find that the hxr light curves @xmath1525 kev show a rapid increase in count rates from 05:17 ut onward indicating the onset of the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "the non - thermal hxr emission continued till @xmath05:25 ut which can be recognized in 2540 kev light curve and further confirmed by hxr spectroscopy ( see section   [ sec : rhessi_spec ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have considered the period from 05:17 to 05:25 ut as the impulsive phase of the flare which is indicated in figure  [ flux_profile ] by grey shaded area .",
    "the mw light curves clearly show that the impulsive phase is characterized by three distinct events of flux enhancement ( marked as events ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' in figure  [ flux_profile ] ) with the first and third peaks at 05:18 ut and 05:21 ut being common in hxr profiles also . during mw peak ` b ' at 05:19:54 ut , the hxr profiles above 25 kev also exhibit flux enhancement but a distinct peak structure as in mw light curves can not be recognized .",
    "further these mw peaks are much more distinguishable at 17 ghz than 34 ghz observations .",
    "after the peak ` c ' , mw flux profiles ( mainly 17 ghz ) exhibit significant fluctuations during the impulsive phase .    in figure [ mainevent ] , we present combined imaging observations of the m6.2 flare in euv , hxr , and mw to show the crucial phases of the flare evolution . following the impulsive onset of hxr and mw emissions ( event ` a ' )",
    ", we observe the rise of the prominence at the source region and intense euv brightening beneath it ( figures  [ mainevent](a)-(c ) ) . in subsequent euv images ,",
    "we observe the evolution of filament in the corona with distinct appearance of its outermost structure ( shown by arrow in figures  [ mainevent](f ) , ( g ) , and ( i ) ) which we term as the ` eruption front ' .",
    "the eruption front likely represents a part of the magnetic structure associated with the erupting filament . in figure",
    "[ exp_ht ] , we provide height - time plot of the eruption front .",
    "the eruption front underwent fastest expansion between 05:21 and 05:23 ut with the speed of @xmath0242  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the eruption speed rapidly decreases after 05:23 ut .",
    "we also note that there is a further decrease in the speed of the eruption front as it moves to higher altitudes ; speed of the eruption front was @xmath165 km s@xmath9 between @xmath005:2305:24 ut which decreased to @xmath126 km s@xmath16 between @xmath005:2405:26 ut .",
    "the eruption front was intact and symmetrical till @xmath005:24 ut while attaining a height of 4.8@xmath710@xmath17 km ( from the source region ) at @xmath005:25 ut .",
    "after 05:25 ut , the eruption front got disrupted ( figure [ mainevent](h ) ) while its major portion ( right segment ; marked by arrow in figure [ mainevent](i ) ) descended which we could track / identify till @xmath505:29 ut . in this interval ,",
    "the downward speed of eruption front was estimated as @xmath095  km  s@xmath18 .",
    "the remaining portion of the eruption front narrowed down while moving further upward and eventually disrupted . in figure",
    "[ tr_norh ] , we present a series of mw sources at 17 and 34 ghz over co - temporal euv 171    images to study the spatial evolution of mw emission in relation to the phases of prominence activity .",
    "lasco on board soho did not detect any cme associated with this flare ] .",
    "the absence of cme suggests that all the erupted material either fell down on the source region or arrested within the overlying coronal magnetic loops .",
    "euv images from @xmath005:2105:23 ut showed a very important phase of eruption which requires more attention .",
    "we present enlarged view of euv images in figure [ kink ] to emphasize some interesting morphological structures during the early evolution of the erupting system .",
    "we observe a system of twisted loops at the western side ( leading side of eruption ) that undergoes fast expansion ( marked by yellow arrows ) .",
    "further some bright spiky structures can be identified at the eastern side ( marked by red arrows ) which conceivably could be the projection of the helically twisted loops . to understand associated high energy emission , we present co - temporal hxr images at 1225 ( orange ) and 2540  kev ( red ) in figure  [ kink](c ) .",
    "we have studied the evolution of rhessi x - ray spectra during the flare over consecutive 20 s intervals from 05:17 ut to 05:25 ut .",
    "further , we have analyzed spectra for a few selected intervals during the pre - flare peaks .",
    "for this analysis , we first generated a rhessi spectrogram with an energy binning of 1/3 kev from 6 to 15 kev , 1 kev from 15 to 100 kev , and 5 kev from 100 to 200 kev energies .",
    "we only used the front segments of the detectors , and excluded detectors 2 and 7 ( which have lower energy resolution and high threshold energies , respectively ) .",
    "the spectra were deconvolved with the full detector response matrix ( i.e. , off - diagonal elements were included ; @xcite ) .",
    "the time intervals for spectral analysis are carefully chosen to avoid the bad intervals due to changes in the attenuator states . in our case , there were two bad intervals during 05:18:0405:18:08 ( change in attenuator state from a@xmath19 to a@xmath20 , i.e. , thin shutter comes in ) and 05:21:2405:21:28 ( change in attenuator state from a@xmath20 to a@xmath21 , i.e. , thin+thick ( both ) shutters are in ) .    in figure [ hsi_spectra ] ,",
    "we illustrate spatially integrated , background subtracted rhessi spectra along with their respective residuals for six selected intervals .",
    "spectral fits were obtained using a forward - fitting method implemented in the ospex code . the hxr emission during pre - flare peaks was observed only up to 20 kev and can be well fitted with an isothermal model ( see figure [ hsi_spectra](a ) ) . during impulsive phase , we note hxr emission up to 100 kev . for this phase , spectral fittings were obtained using the bremsstrahlung and line spectrum of an isothermal plasma and a non - thermal thick - target bremsstrahlung model ( i.e. , combination of vth and thick2 models ; see figures [ hsi_spectra](b)-(f ) ) .",
    "also , we have chosen different time intervals for fitting during pre - flare peaks ( 1 minute ) and impulsive phase ( 20 s ) for better counts statistics . in figure",
    "[ plasma_param ] , we plot various spectroscopic parameters derived from spectral fittings : temperature ( @xmath22 ) and emission measure ( @xmath23 ) from thermal fits ; low - energy cutoff ( @xmath24 ) and electron spectral index ( @xmath25 ) from non - thermal thick - target fits .",
    "rhessi observations reveal a very high plasma temperature ( @xmath2632 mk ) at the time of first hxr peak at 05:18 ut ( see figure [ plasma_param](a ) ) while @xmath23 remains at lower values , which suggest intense heating within localized regions .",
    "later on , both , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 exhibit smooth variations ( see figures [ plasma_param](a ) and ( b ) ) .    from the thermal parameters , we have further estimated density ( @xmath27 ) and pressure ( @xmath28 ) of the flaring region ( see figure [ plasma_param](c ) ) .",

    "these studies indicate that shrinkage in lt sources are associated with converging fp motions , making us to predict that simultaneity of the two phenomena could be part of the coronal implosion .",
    "@xcite presented observations of contraction of large coronal loops during the early impulsive phase of sol2005 - 07 - 30 of class c8.9 .",
    "this contraction was found in three clusters of euv loops observed at 171   that sustained for a longer interval with relatively slower speed ( @xmath110 minutes with an average speed of @xmath15 km s@xmath9 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported loop contraction in euv 171   images during the impulsive phase of m6.4 flare sol2012 - 03 - 09 that was associated with loop oscillations .",
    "it is widely believed that coronal transients derive their energy from the energy stored locally in the coronal magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite conjectured that the energy conversion process during transient events would involve a magnetic implosion when the following assumptions hold : ( 1 ) the energy required for the event must come from the corona directly ; ( 2 ) gravitational potential energy plays no significant role ; ( 3 ) low plasma @xmath61 in the corona . with these assumptions ,",
    "the conservation of energy implies that magnetic energy decreases between the static states before and after the energy release .",
    "the reduction of magnetic energy , @xmath62 dv , and consequently the reduction of the magnetic pressure , b@xmath63 , would inevitably result in the contraction of overlying field lines so as to achieve a new force balance .",
    "the observations of the contraction of overlying coronal loops during and before the impulsive phase of flares by high temporal cadence images from trace and sdo support the predictions of the conjecture by @xcite . however , the observational evidences for the contraction in coronal loops are uncommon for the majority of flares that exhibit explosive rather than implosive behaviour .",
    "we note that in our observations prolonged coronal implosion displays three distinct stages with varying speed of loop contraction ( figure [ imp_ht](a ) ) . here",
    "it is important to focus on the brief and localized x - ray and mw emissions that were observed from the core region of the overlying loop system a few minute before the onset of contraction ( figures [ pre-2](b)(d ) ) .",
    "later on this region brightened up in euv images also with the localized brightening of multiple low - lying loops .",
    "more importantly , the contraction speed rapidly increased @xmath15 minute before the flare onset and this phase is co - temporal with the sequential brightenings of low - lying coronal loops at the core region during which x - ray and mw emissions intensified ( figure [ pre-2 ] ) .",
    "the observations of sequential and localized brightenings during pre - flare phase imply episodic release of small amount of energy which can be considered as the signature of magnetic reconnection at relatively small - scales ( in contrast to large - scale reconnection during the flare impulsive phase ) @xcite .",
    "rhessi observations of this phase further indicate that this interval is mostly dominated by the thermal emission .",
    "the slow and gradual energy release over the prolonged pre - flare phase will cause the magnetic pressure of the coronal loop system to decrease .",
    "it is likely that during this slow preheating phase , the increase of the thermal pressure is mainly due to localized heating and gentle evaporation which is not enough to compensate for the decrease of the magnetic pressure ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this will result in the implosion of the surrounding flaring region consisting of euv coronal loops .",
    "we therefore conjecture that multiple small - scale , localized events of energy release at the core region over the prolonged preheating phase favourably contributed to sustain a large - scale contraction of coronal loops . with the onset of the ` standard flare reconnection ' during the impulsive energy release , the implosion becomes insignificant as the large - scale magnetic reconnection proceeds successively in higher coronal loops stretched by the eruption of the prominence or magnetic flux rope .",
    "we examine the temporal and morphological evolution of mw and hxr emission during the impulsive phase ( i.e. , shaded area in figure  [ flux_profile ] ) and their associations with the prominence activation .",
    "the comparisons of spatial and temporal structures of hxr and mw emission offer us crucial information on different aspects of conditions in the solar atmosphere where the flare occurs as both types of emissions are produced by highly energetic electrons but with different emission mechanisms .",
    "the hxr emission most likely arises from bremsstrahlung produced when energetic electrons are decelerated by coulomb forces in collisions with the ambient ions , either in the chromosphere or in the corona .",
    "bremsstrahlung hxr emission is proportional to the product of the non - thermal electron density and the ambient ion density . on the other hand ,",
    "non - thermal mw emission is produced by the gyrosynchrotron mechanism which depends on the magnetic field intensity and its direction .",
    "the gyrosynchrotron production mechanism is very efficient and allows us to detect electrons at energies of hundreds of kev , even when their numbers are very low .",
    "microwave emission can also be produced by thermal electrons through bremsstrahlung in sufficiently dense thermal plasma ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "the impulsive phase is characterized by three events of flux enhancements in mw emission denoted by ` a ' , ` b ' , and ` c ' . it is worth to note that the events ` a ' and ` c ' occurred simultaneously in mw and hxr profiles while ` b ' is largely missing in hxr measurements .",
    "the spatial evolution of hxr emission with respect to euv images ( see figure  [ mainevent ] ) provides some important insights to understand the relationship between flare emission and phases of prominence activity .",
    "we find that at the very beginning of the impulsive phase ( @xmath05:17 ut ; figure  [ mainevent](a ) ) , two distinct 1225 kev hxr sources are observed and at this time the flare related euv brightening at hxr source locations is insignificant .",
    "soon afterwards , non - thermal high energy hxr emission ( at 40@xmath64100 kev energy band ) was observed from the same location with two distinct , well separated emission centroids ( see figure  [ mainevent](b ) ) .",
    "this phase corresponds to the first peak of the impulsive phase ( i.e. , event ` a ' marked in figure  [ flux_profile ] ) . at this time ,",
    "plasma temperature ( estimated from rhessi spectra ; figure  [ hsi_spectra](b ) ) raised to @xmath032  mk  which also corresponds to the maximum temperature during the flare ( figure  [ plasma_param](a ) ) .",
    "the high temperature and low emission measure ( figure  [ plasma_param](a ) and ( b ) ) indicate impulsive heating of plasma within a small volume which is also consistent with corresponding euv images that show localized brightening .",
    "we also note that this very epoch is associated with significant non - thermal characteristics with an electron spectral index @xmath59 @xmath05 ( figures  [ hsi_spectra ] and [ plasma_param ] ) .",
    "it is further noteworthy that during event ` a ' , high energy hxr source at 40@xmath64100  kev resembles the mw source at 34 ghz ; both show emission from an extended region with the appearance of two distinct well separated emission centroids ( see also figures  [ mainevent](b ) and [ tr_norh](a ) ) . in figure [ mdi_hsi ] , these conjugate emission centroids are indicated on combined wl / magnetogram image as s1 and s2 .",
    "the associations of s1 and s2 with opposite polarity magnetic regions suggest that they probably represent emissions from the footpoints of a flaring loop .",
    "on the other hand the 17 ghz source resembles the hxr emitting structure at relatively lower energies ( @xmath6540 kev ) .",
    "we also note that event ` a ' is followed by the rise and subsequent eruption of the prominence .",
    "the peak of the impulsive phase ( i.e. , event ` c ' ) occurred simultaneously in hxr and mw emission . at this time , hxr sources at energies @xmath1525  kev  exhibit a single structure ( figure  [ mainevent](d ) ) .",
    "the non - thermal hxr emission is generally believed to originate from footpoint locations of coronal loops by thick - target bremsstrahlung , thus observations of pairs of hxr sources are expected .",
    "the single hxr source implies that the two footpoints are very close indicating energy release in small low - lying loops ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it should be noted that the present event occurred close to the limb , so due to projection effects the footpoint sources may appear much closer than their actual separation .",

    "here we emphasize that this phase corresponds to the interval when the erupting prominence attained the maximum speed of @xmath0242  km  s@xmath14 ( figure  [ exp_ht ] ) .",

    "the flux rope structure was seen in euv 171     ( which represents plasma at a temperature of @xmath01 mk ) presumably due to the heating of the prominence that lies within the flux rope .",

    "we have presented a comprehensive multi - wavelength study of an m6.2 flare which is associated with a confined eruption of a prominence - flux rope system . the availability of a wide range of multi - wavelength data ( euv , mw , x - ray ) from the beginning of the pre - flare to the end of the impulsive phase of the event provided us with a unique opportunity to probe several flare associated phenomena in detail : large - scale loop contraction , small - scale loop brightenings , eruption of prominence - flux rope system and its subsequent confinement . in the following ,",
    "we summarize the important results of this study :    1 .",
    "we have reported implosion of overlying coronal loops that continued over 30 minute during which overlying loops underwent contraction by 20 mm ( @xmath140 % of their original height ) during the pre - flare phase .",
    "such a large - scale contraction has been reported for the first time .",
    "we observe episodic and localized events of energy release in low - lying loops at the core of the large overlying loops . by synthesizing the multi - wavelength data , we propose that prolonged loop contraction is a manifestation of localized events of energy release that occurred intermittently during the pre - flare phase of the m6.2 flare .",
    "the pre - flare phase was dominated by thermal emission with temperatures beyond 20 mk .",
    "this indicates that the plasma was already substantially preheated at the flare core before the onset of impulsive phase .",
    "we believe that the strong preheating at the flare core will contribute favorably toward efficient particle acceleration during the subsequent impulsive phase of the event .",
    "the impulsive phase of the flare is characterized by multiple non - thermal peaks .",
    "after the first impulsive peak , associated with strong hxr emission up to 40 - 100 kev , we observe the activation of the prominence and its supporting flux rope .",
    "our observations imply that the onset of impulsive flare emission ( which probably corresponds to large - scale magnetic reconnection ) has triggered the eruption of the flux rope .",
    "4 .   rhessi spectroscopy reveals high plasma temperatures ( @xmath130 mk ) and substantial non - thermal characteristics with electron spectral index ( @xmath805 ) during the impulsive phase of the flare . during this phase , characterized by two sequential hxr peaks",
    ", the ratio of total non - thermal energy to maximum thermal energy was found to be @xmath17.6 which is consistent with earlier studies .",
    "more importantly , the time - evolution of thermal energy nicely correlates with the variations of the cumulative non - thermal energy throughout the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of conversion of the energy of accelerated particles to hot flare plasma and is well consistent with the neupert effect .",
    "the prominence along with its supporting flux rope could not have a successful escape through the overlying coronal loops and therefore leads to a confined eruption .",
    "the observations of the confinement process of the flux rope are remarkable ; we detect multiple coronal mw sources along the trajectory of the eruption .",
    "the euv images show hot plasma blobs on the location of these coronal sources . in our opinion ,",
    "the coronal mw sources represent emission from hot plasma blobs which are formed within the collapsing magnetic flux rope as a result of its interaction with the overlying and surrounding magnetic field lines .",
    "this paper highlights the importance of studying the pre - flare activity .",
    "this study also underlines that confined eruptions form a very interesting category of solar eruptive phenomena .",
    "their investigations provide a unique opportunity to probe the interaction among different magnetic field systems in the corona besides exploring the triggering mechanisms and energy releases processes .",

    "<S> the pre - flare phase of this event is characterized by spectacular large - scale contraction of overlying extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) coronal loops during which the loop system was subjected to an altitude decrease of @xmath020  mm ( 40% of the initial height ) for an extended span of @xmath030 min . </S>",
    "<S> this contraction phase is accompanied by sequential euv brightenings associated with hard x - ray ( hxr ) ( up to 25 kev ) and microwave ( mw ) sources from low - lying loops in the core of the flaring region which together with x - ray spectra indicate strong localized heating in the source region before the filament activation and associated m - class flare . with the onset of the impulsive phase of the m6.2 flare , we detect hxr and mw sources that exhibit intricate temporal and spatial evolution in relation with the fast rise of the prominence . following the flare maximum , the filament eruption slowed down and subsequently confined within the large overlying active region loops ; the event did not lead to a coronal mass ejection ( cme ) . during the confinement process of the erupting prominence </S>",
    "<S> , we detect mw emission from the extended coronal region with multiple emission centroids which likely represent emission from hot blobs of plasma formed after the collapse of the expanding flux rope and entailing prominence material . </S>",
    "<S> rhessi observations reveal high plasma temperature ( @xmath130 mk ) and substantial non - thermal characteristics with electron spectral index ( @xmath25 ) during the impulsive phase of the flare . the time - evolution of thermal energy exhibits a good correspondence with the variations in cumulative non - thermal energy which suggest that the energy of accelerated particles efficiently converted to hot flare plasma implying an effective validation of the neupert effect . </S>"
