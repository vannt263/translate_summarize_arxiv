    "to describe the low energy behavior of the @xmath0 gauge field in the four dimensional minkowskii spacetime @xmath6 , several authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite advocated to decompose the gauge - fixed @xmath0 gauge field @xmath7 into some scalar fields and a @xmath4 gauge field . in the notation of faddeev and niemi @xcite , @xmath7 is decomposed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an isovector scalar field satisfying @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 are isoscalar scalar fields and @xmath13 is a gauge - fixed @xmath4 gauge field .",
    "when a configuration @xmath7 and the field @xmath9 are fixed , the fields @xmath13 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 where the suffix @xmath16 on the right hand sides of eqs .",

    "in other words , the field @xmath9 must be chosen so as to ensure that @xmath18 and @xmath19 do not depend on @xmath16 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that this condition for @xmath9 can be expressed as the following equation : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are defined by @xmath23 and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are arbitrary functions .",

    "on the other hand , the relation between the hopf invariant and the instanton number was discussed by taubes@xcite and jahn@xcite .",

    "it was suggested that , in analogy with the lower dimensional models such as 2 + 1 georgi - glashow model and the 1 + 1 dimensional schwinger model , the regulated meron pair might play an important role in the discussion of the confinement of the color charge @xcite .",
    "since the above discussion implies that the gauge field for the meron can be expressed simply as @xmath211 near the singularities , the color confinement mechanism might be discussed in a different manner .    at the end of the paper , we investigate if our @xmath1 solves the field equation of the model proposed in @xcite .",
