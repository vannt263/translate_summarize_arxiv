    "quite recently , quantum fisher information ( qfi ) @xcite has attracted considerable attention , not only due to its own significance in quantum estimation theory and quantum information theory , but also associated with recent rapid progress in quantum - enhanced metrology @xcite .",
    "in fact , as an important measure of information content of quantum states , qfi has already played a critical role in quantum statistical inference through its inextricable relationship with cramr - rao inequality @xcite .",
    "moreover , qfi also has various applications in other quantum information tasks such as characterization of non - markovianity @xcite , investigation of uncertainy relations @xcite and entanglement detection @xcite , just to name a few . besides , since every realistic system will inevitably suffer from the decoherence induced by the coupling to its surroundings , it is natural to explore the dynamics of qfi in all sorts of quantum noise channels @xcite , as we do when we analyse quantum entanglement , quantum discord and bell nonlocality .",
    "a great deal of research has been devoted to this perspective of qfi , which is well motivated within the framework of noisy quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the combination of quantum information science and relativity theory leads us to a deeper interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite and opens up a new way to understand the information paradox when black holes are involved @xcite . in particular , what the community care about is how the unruh - hawking effect affects the  information contents \" ( or more especially , correlation measures ) in quantum states . therefore , diverse efforts have been made to investigate the dynamics of teleportation fidelity @xcite , quantum entanglement @xcite , quantum discord @xcite , bell nonlocality @xcite and some other information quantities in noninertial frames @xcite .",
    "intuitively , it was widely believed that the unruh effect can only cause the degradation of quantum correlations shared between an inertial and an accelerated observer .",
    "however , montero and martn - martnez have pointed that the unruh effect can create net quantum entanglement depending on the choice of the inertial state @xcite .",
    "hence we can not merely view the unruh effect as a _ usual _ noise channel since some counterintuitive and subtle phenomena will appear .",
    "consequently , it will be interesting to study how the relativistic effect affects the quantum fisher information or the performance of parameter estimation protocols . however , only a few authors have attempted to address on this problem @xcite .",
    "m. aspachs _",
    "_ discussed the optimal detection of the unruh - hawking effect itself ( eg . the acceleration parameter or unruh temperature ) and proved that fock states can achieve the maximal qfi when considering a scalar field in a two - dimensional minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "hosler and kok numerically studied the noon states based parameter estimation protocol over an unruh channel and found counterintuitive result that the single - rail encoding is superior to the dual rail @xcite .",
    "furthermore , m. ahmadi _",
    "provided a framework of relativistic quantum metrology where the relativistic effect can be viewed as a resource for quantum technologies @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we investigate the performance of quantum fisher information for both scalar and dirac fields in noninertial frames . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to consider the parameterized pure two - qubit state as the initial state , where two parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are introduced .",
    "interestingly , our analytical results indicate that even in this seemingly _ simple _ case the qfi has a rich and subtle physical structure : ( i ) @xmath2 remains invariant for both scalar and dirac fields ; ( ii ) for both cases @xmath3 decreases with the increase of acceleration @xmath4 but approaches a finite value in the limit of infinite acceleration and more importantly , the distribution symmetry of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath0 has been broken by the influence of unruh effect .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we review the properties of qfi and summarize the recent progress on its analytical calculation . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the effect of unruh noise on qfi of the parameterized ( and arbitrary ) two - qubit states in both scalar and dirac fields . finally , section iv is devoted to the discussion and conclusion .",
    "consider we have an n - dimensional quantum state @xmath6 depending on an unknown parameter @xmath7 .",
    "if we intend to extract information about @xmath7 form @xmath6 , a set of quantum measurements @xmath8 should be performed . according to classical statistical theory , the quality of any measurement(s )",
    "can be specified by a form of information called fisher information @xcite @xmath9 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 $ ] denotes the conditional probability of acquiring the measurement result @xmath11 when the value of the parameter is @xmath7 .",
    "optimizing over all possible measurements , we can define the quantum fisher information @xcite @xmath12 to move forward , we can rewrite the qfi explicitly as @xmath13 by introducing the so - called symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) @xmath14 satisfying the relation @xmath15 it is worth pointing out that the complete set of eigenvectors of @xmath14 constitutes the optimal povm to achieve the qfi ( or equivalently , the maximal classical fisher information ) @xcite .    apart from the basic properties such as convexity and monotonicity ( eg , nonincreasing under stochastic operations ) @xcite , the qfi is naturally related to the bures distance or uhlmann fidelity @xcite @xmath16 where the bures distance can be defined as @xcite @xmath17 therefore ,",
    "if we have obtained the explicit form of bures distance of the corresponding states , then the formula of qfi can be straightforwardly derived applying this relation .",
    "recently , we note that this strategy has already been exploited in several situations : the single qubit @xcite , single - mode gaussian @xcite and two - mode gaussian states @xcite .    on the other hand , based on the spectrum decomposition @xmath18",
    ", the qfi can be rephrased as @xcite @xmath19 with the eigenvalues @xmath20 and @xmath21 . however , this expression is somewhat difficult to use especially when the dimension of @xmath6 is very large , since the eigenvectors with respect to zero eigenvalues are all involved in the calculation .",
    "fortunately , employing the completeness relation @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the dimension of the support of @xmath6 , refs . @xcite and @xcite provided a new expression of the qfi for general states ( see also @xcite ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the qfi of pure state @xmath28 @xmath29 from this expression we can see that the qfi of a non - full - rank states is only determined by its support(eg , by the subset of @xmath30 with nonzero eigenvalues ) .",
    "furthermore , one can clearly identify that the qfi can also be divided into three parts : the first term is just the classical contribution if we regard the set of nonzero eigenvalues as a probability distribution ; the second term is a weighted average over all pure - state qfi ; the last term stems from the mixture of pure states and thus decrease the total qfi .",
    "( [ mixed ] ) is relatively simple and has a clear physical meaning , it will be a starting point for our analysis .",
    "in this section , we investigate how the unruh effect affects the qfi in both scalar and dirac fields .",
    "since the maximally entangled states such as bell or ghz states were adopted as the initial states to demonstrate the effect of unruh noise in most previous literature , here we mainly focus on the parameterized ( and arbitrary ) two - qubit pure states @xmath31 where the unknown arguments @xmath0 and @xmath1 are to be estimated and could be named as _ weight _ and _ phase _ parameters respectively .",
    "one can easily obtain the qfi with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath32 which shows that the qfi of @xmath0 is irrespective of @xmath1 ( and keeps constant ) while the qfi of @xmath1 depends on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath5 , @xmath3 reaches its maximum indicating that the _ balance - weighted _ state is preferable .",
    "this observation is reminiscent of previous results about the noon state that it has been widely exploited in quantum metrology to achieve the heisenberg limit @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also note that @xmath3 is symmetric with respect to @xmath5 in the absence of unruh effect .",
    "to understand the unruh effect @xcite , we assume that one observer alice stays in a inertial frame while her partner rob undergoes uniform acceleration @xmath33 , each holding a mode of a free massless scalar field in minkowski space - time . in order to describe what rob perceives from his perspective",
    ", we should transform from the minkowski coordinates @xmath34 to the rindler coordinates @xmath35 @xmath36 which defines the right ( region @xmath37 ) and left ( region @xmath38 ) rindler wedges .",
    "usually we refer to the accelerating observer in region @xmath37 and @xmath38 as rob and anti - rob respectively . according to the bogoliubov transformation @xcite , the minkowski vacuum state and single excitation state can be expressed in terms of rindler modes @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the mode decomposition in region @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , and @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "since rob is causally disconnected from region @xmath38 ( eg , anti - rob is physically inaccessible ) , we must trace over the state of region @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , one can verify that an entangled pure state seen by alice in inertial frame will be recognized as a mixed state by the accelerated observer rob .",
    "therefore , in the language of quantum formation theory , the unruh effect can be viewed as a noise channel which consists of two steps : ( i ) mapping the state in minkowski space to rindler modes according to the transformation ( [ transformation ] ) and then ( ii ) tracing over the causally disconnected region @xmath38 .",
    "assume that alice and rob initially share the two - qubit pure state eq .",
    "( [ initial ] ) from an inertial perspective , and then rob is uniformly accelerated with @xmath33 . due to the action of the unruh channel",
    ", we will arrive at a mixed state @xmath44 where @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "further , we notice that the @xmath47 block composed by the basis @xmath48 can be effectively regarded as a _ pure qubit _ since one - qubit pure states @xmath49 have the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the bloch vector and @xmath52 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath53 can be rewritten as ( note that @xmath54 is unnormalized ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 into a _ mixture _ of pure states in distinct blocks .",
    "first , we consider the qfi associated with @xmath0",
    ". keeping in mind that @xmath57 also contains information about @xmath0 , we obtain the classical part of @xmath2 @xmath58 meanwhile , utilizing the identities @xmath59 and the formula eq .",
    "( [ pure ] ) , we can get the quantum part of @xmath2 @xmath60,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 it is worth emphasizing that the last term of eq .",
    "( [ mixed ] ) does not contribute to @xmath2 because @xmath62 and @xmath63 with @xmath64 locate on different subspaces .",
    "indeed , one can find that @xmath65 is also equal to zero by using the identities eqs .",
    "( [ identity ] ) again , that is @xmath66 all together , @xmath2 is given by @xmath67 moreover , we note that the following formulas hold @xmath68 intriguingly , we finally arrive at the conclusion that @xmath2 keeps _ invariant _ , that is , @xmath69 independent of the acceleration parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this result implies that the qfi about @xmath0 is unaffected under the effect of the unruh channel .    on the other hand , @xmath70 or @xmath57",
    "do not rely on the parameter @xmath1 and then the classical part of @xmath3 is just zero .",
    "therefore , @xmath3 can only stem from the average qfi of the pure states @xmath71 @xmath72 furthermore , we can obtain the analytical expression of @xmath3 by introducing the hypergeometric function @xcite ( for simplicity , we put the formula in the appendix ) .     as a function of the acceleration parameter @xmath4 where @xmath73 from bottom to top ; ( b ) @xmath74 as a function of the acceleration @xmath4 .",
    "note that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are symmetric with respect to @xmath77 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ] +    as a function of the acceleration parameter @xmath4 where @xmath73 from bottom to top ; ( b ) @xmath74 as a function of the acceleration @xmath4 .",
    "note that @xmath75 and @xmath76 are symmetric with respect to @xmath77 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ]    one can check that the limitation @xmath78 consistent with the initial value and indeed there are some other points that deserve our attention : ( i ) we have plotted the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath3 for a series of values of @xmath0 in fig . [",
    "fisher1](a ) and found that as the acceleration @xmath4 increases , @xmath3 gradually decreases and converges to _ non - zero _ value in the limit of infinite acceleration , which is in sharp contrast with entanglement @xcite ; ( ii ) we also observe that @xmath3 is no longer a monotonically increasing function of @xmath0 in the interval @xmath79 $ ] and does not achieve the maximum at @xmath5 for certain fixed value of @xmath4 .",
    "more remarkably , the symmetry of the function @xmath3 with respect to @xmath5 has been broken as we can see from fig . [ fisher1](b ) .",
    "for vanishing acceleration , @xmath80 as we expect . however , for small values of @xmath4 , @xmath81 and when @xmath82 , @xmath83 and also approaches a finite value .",
    "now we turn to discuss the qfi for a free dirac field .",
    "a similar analysis shows that the minkowski vacuum and one - excitation state in terms of rindler states is given by @xcite @xmath84 where @xmath85 ( note that @xmath86 ) and the range of the acceleration parameter is @xmath87 corresponding to @xmath88 .",
    "the distinction between the transformations eqs .",
    "( [ transformation ] ) and ( [ transformation1 ] ) pertaining respectively to scalar and dirac fields is physically induced by the differences between the bose - einstein and fermi - dirac statistics @xcite .    through the unruh channel for the dirac case",
    ", the reduced density matrix between alice and rob takes the form @xmath89 with the help of the formula eq .",
    "( [ mixed ] ) , we only need the nonzero eigenvalues @xmath90 and the corresponding ( normalized ) eigenvectors latexmath:[\\[\\begin{gathered }     full information to calculate the qfi .",
    "first , the classical contribution of @xmath2 is @xmath92 meanwhile , we notice that @xmath93 does not contain any information about @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "hence we can obtain the quantum part of @xmath2 @xmath94 where we resort to the facts that @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the qfi with respect to @xmath0 is given by @xmath97 interestingly , we have shown that @xmath2 also remains unchanged which is the same as the scalar case .",
    "it is worth stressing that this is a highly nontrivial result , since for an arbitrary single - qubit state w. zhong _ et.al .",
    "_ found that only phase - damping channel would cause no disturbance to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the qfi @xmath3 boils down to @xmath98 similarly , one can easily find that @xmath78 .",
    "interestingly , the symmetry with respect to @xmath5 is also broken due to the unruh effect ( see fig . [ fisher2 ] ) , the same as the situation of the scalar field .",
    "as a function of the acceleration parameter @xmath4 and @xmath0 . ]",
    "however , one can prove that @xmath3 can _ not _ be amplified along with increasing the acceleration .",
    "in fact , the first order derivative of @xmath3 is given by @xmath99 and yet , @xmath3 does not reduce to zero but remains finite in the infinite acceleration limit , that is @xmath100    finally , we also investigate how the unruh effect influences the distribution of the qfi over subsystems @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the qfi with respect to parameter @xmath103 in subsystem @xmath104 .",
    "one can easily check that the reduced states @xmath105 and @xmath106 contain no information about @xmath1 and hence @xmath107 irrespective of the values of @xmath4 and @xmath0 . since @xmath108 and @xmath109 , actually @xmath2 is always smaller than the sum of qfi of the two subsystems .",
    "this is to say , the qfi can be either subadditive or superadditive under the unruh effect depending on the specific parameter that we concern .",
    "as an important measure of the information content of quantum states , quantum fisher information plays an essential role in both statistical theory and quantum metrology .",
    "however , unlike other correlation measures such as quantum entanglement and discord , the qfi usually reveals intricate and subtle behavior since the qfi characterizes the intrinsic sensitivity of the system being discussed with respect to the change of certain specific parameters . in this paper , we have investigated the performance of qfi under the unruh - hawking effect in the context of relativistic quantum information theory .",
    "here we mainly focus on the parameterized ( and arbitrary ) pure two - qubit states where two corresponding parameters are naturally introduced : the weight parameter @xmath0 and phase parameter @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that alice and rob each share one mode of the two - qubit state , and then rob is uniformly accelerated",
    ". meanwhile , from the perspective of quantum information theory , the unruh effect can also be viewed as a particular quantum operation or quantum noise channel @xcite .    to complete our analysis ,",
    "both bosonic and fermionic field are detailedly considered .",
    "our analytical results indicates that the qfi has a rich and subtle physical structure in both cases . for the scalar field",
    ", @xmath2 keeps constant irrespective of the acceleration parameter @xmath4 , while @xmath3 decreases gradually with increasing acceleration but remains finite in the @xmath82 limit . for the dirac field",
    ", we have demonstrated that @xmath2 still remains unchanged , similarly to the bosonic case .",
    "meanwhile , we have proved that @xmath3 can never be amplified for arbitrary values of @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , we find that the symmetry of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath5 is broken by the unruh effect in both cases . finally , we have also checked how the unruh effect affects the distribution of the qfi over subsystems of a dirac field .",
    "it is demonstrated that @xmath3 is obviously superadditive but @xmath2 is always subadditive independent of the acceleration @xmath4 and @xmath0 itself @xcite .    in view of these findings , there are some further problems to be addressed : ( i ) the relativistic effect on quantum metrology and other quantum technologies is still not so clear . indeed , for specific setting - ups",
    ", one should clarify whether the relativistic effect could be a resource or an obstacle for corresponding quantum tasks @xcite ; ( ii ) the distribution property of qfi in tripartite ( eg , ghz states ) or multipartite systems would be very interesting to investigate , especially when certain kinds of quantum channels ( or quantum noises ) are introduced .",
    "moreover , when finalizing the work , we are aware that our analytical results can be regarded as a complement to the recent numerical work by hosler and kok @xcite ( see fig . 2 and 3 in their paper ) .",

    "<S> we investigate the performance of quantum fisher information under the unruh - hawking effect , where one of the observers ( eg , rob ) is uniformly accelerated with respect to other partners . in the context of relativistic quantum information theory , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that quantum fisher information , as an important measure of the information content of quantum states , has a rich and subtle physical structure comparing with entanglement or bell nonlocality . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we mainly focus on the parameterized ( and arbitrary ) pure two - qubit states , where the weight parameter @xmath0 and phase parameter @xmath1 are naturally introduced . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , we prove that @xmath2 keeps unchanged for both scalar and dirac fields </S>",
    "<S> . meanwhile , we observe that @xmath3 decreases with the increase of acceleration @xmath4 but remains finite in the limit of infinite acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , our results show that the symmetry of @xmath3 ( with respect to @xmath5 ) has been broken by the influence of unruh effect for both cases . </S>"
