    "an important part of the historical record of galaxy formation is locked up in the ages and metallicities of the earliest stellar populations , particularly those found in the halos of galaxies . for most galaxies , however , even the brightest old - halo stars are too dim to be seen as anything but a smooth distribution of integrated light , from which it is difficult to deduce much more than the mean age and metallicity of the population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "giant ellipticals present a special challenge because they are the only galaxy type not found in the local group , thus few are close enough to allow direct , comprehensive probes into their stellar populations .",
    "ngc 5128 , the central giant elliptical in the centaurus group just 4 mpc distant , is an outstanding exception .",
    "recently , we used deep @xmath0 photometry from @xmath9 to obtain color - magnitude diagrams for fields in the outer halo of ngc 5128 , at projected galactocentric distances of 21 and 31 kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter papers i and ii ) .",
    "the cmds of these halo fields reveal the top @xmath10 magnitudes of a normal old red - giant branch ( rgb ) , with a wide range in color that is indicative of a broad metallicity range .",
    "since the rgb loci for old stars are predominantly sensitive to metallicity rather than age , they can be used to construct a first - order _ metallicity distribution function _ ( mdf )  the first such one for any giant elliptical and one which does not rely on indirect arguments from luminosity - weighted integrated light .",
    "the mdf is an important step towards constructing an eventual age - metallicity relation ( amr ) to constrain its evolutionary history .    in the present study , we present similar data for an `` inner halo '' ( or alternatively an `` outer bulge '' ) field much closer in to the center of ngc 5128 , at a projected distance of 8 kpc",
    "this field reveals important differences in the mdf compared with the outer - halo fields and , perhaps , give us the first direct look at the pure bulge population of a giant elliptical .",
    "the location of our 8-kpc target field is southwest of the center of ngc 5128 with the pc1 chip center at @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( j2000 ) .",
    "this location avoids the central dust lane ( see figure 1 of paper ii for a finder chart ) , and comparison with a deep @xmath13 color image by @xcite sensitive to the presence of dust shows that it also avoids two thin dust streamers extending southward along the major axis .",
    "the raw observations , taken in hst cycle 8 for program go-8195 , consisted of a sequence of 14 half - orbit exposures in f606w ( wide @xmath14 ) totalling 17500 seconds , and 10 exposures in f814w ( wide @xmath15 ) totalling 12100 seconds , the same as for our 31-kpc field taken during the same program .",
    "data analysis paralleled what we did for the 31-kpc field and our procedures are discussed in detail in paper ii .",
    "pointings in the sequence of raw images differed by several pixels in ( @xmath16 ) , and we reregistered the individual exposures and median - combined them with the normal iraf and stsdas packages to produce clean median images free of cosmic rays , bad pixels , and other artifacts .",
    "photometry on the master @xmath14 and @xmath15 frames was then carried out with the daophot ii code @xcite in the same manner as described in papers i and ii , with a two - pass sequence of find , phot , and allstar .",
    "transformation of the instrumental magnitudes to final @xmath17 values followed the prescriptions of @xcite",
    ".    the one important respect in which the data reduction for this field differed from our previous work arose from the level of stellar crowding .",
    "while the two outer fields ( papers i , ii ) are completely uncrowded at the characteristic wfpc2 @xmath18 resolution , the 8-kpc field has a sufficiently high density of resolved stars to make the photometry in the three wf chips quite difficult and any discussion of these is not pursued further here .",
    "on the pc1 chip with its superior resolution , the photometry is much more easily manageable with careful attention to defining the stellar point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we carried out complete reductions of the pc1 images with five different empirically constructed psfs : ( 1 ) the gaussian - plus - residuals model in daophot , constructed from an average of several bright stars in the pc1 chip with three iterations of `` cleaning '' neighbors from around the psf candidate stars , ( 2 ) the lorentzian - plus - residuals model in daophot , ( 3 ) psfs for @xmath14 and @xmath15 supplied from the stsci archive , ( 4 ) psfs derived from uncrowded bright stars on other pc1 images ( stetson , private communication ) , and ( 5 ) psfs taken from the pc1 images in our uncrowded outer - halo fields . in each case",
    "we independently rederived the necessary aperture corrections through curves of growth to normalize the psf - fitted magnitudes to the @xmath19 aperture radius used in the holtzman et al",
    ".  calibrations .",
    "the results which clearly gave the cleanest fits to the image , and which we adopted , were the lorentzian - based psfs constructed iteratively from the 8-kpc pc1 field itself .",
    "however , despite differences in the psf profile shapes and the consequent aperture corrections , the final lists of calibrated @xmath0 stellar magnitudes ( essentially resting on the psf scalings derived by allstar ) proved to be very similar across all five types of psf models .",
    "the final color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) in @xmath20 for a total of 17,283 stars on pc1 detected in both filters is shown in figure [ fig1 ]",
    ". the full dataset can be obtained from the authors on request . for this inner field , we made no attempt to find or remove nonstellar objects from the list ; although there are a few faint background galaxies visible in the field , their numbers ( from the image classification analysis done more completely in papers i and ii ) are quite small here compared with the overwhelmingly large population of stars , and the high degree of crowding would , in any case , vitiate objective measurements of nonstellar image shapes for most such objects .",
    "the cmd , when compared with our previous data for the outer - halo fields , shows the same old rgb population with a bright - end `` tip '' at @xmath21 , but extends even further to the red than did the outer fields .",
    "the number of stars appearing above the rgb tip ( @xmath22 ) that might arise from a younger agb population , for example ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and papers i and ii ) , is statistically negligible . within the main rgb distribution ,",
    "however , our deductions about the range of metallicities of these stars depend on the effects of photometric measurement scatter , and the much higher level of crowding here makes this question more acute . to investigate the photometric scatter",
    ", we carried out several simulations in which 500 stars at a time were added to the original images , with input colors and magnitudes following an ideal , narrow rgb sequence .",
    "these images were then measured in exactly the same procedure ( two - pass find / allstar ) , yielding the results shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the artificial - star tests show higher scatter than did the same tests on the outer fields ( as expected from the higher degree of crowding ; compare figure 5 from paper ii ) , but within the upper part of the rgb , the observed color spread is far larger than can be explained by photometric errors and must be intrinsic to the stellar population .",
    "the trend of measurement scatter in each band is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "encouragingly , in both @xmath14 and @xmath15 the simulations revealed no photometric _ bias _ larger than @xmath23 mag at any level of interest here , i.e. much smaller than the level of measurement uncertainty .",
    "we therefore made no attempts to apply any bias corrections .",
    "lastly , the artificial - star tests were used to estimate the photometric detection completeness as a function of magnitude .",
    "the levels at which the numbers of detected stars drop to 50% of the numbers put in can be expressed ( once the instrumental @xmath24 magnitudes are folded through the holtzman et al .",
    "calibration relations ) as @xmath25 @xmath26    approximate completeness curves in @xmath14 and @xmath15 are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the two smooth curves are pritchet interpolation functions @xcite of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the magnitude at which 50% completeness is reached and @xmath29 is a parameter governing the steepness of the decline in @xmath30 .",
    "the curves shown in the figure are for a particular color @xmath31 and are only to be taken as indicative of the average magnitudes at which the photometry becomes severely incomplete . in practice",
    ", we define @xmath30 in terms of the _ instrumental _ magnitudes @xmath24 and then translate them through the photometric calibration equations into the appropriate @xmath32 for each point in the cmd .    for the purposes of deriving the stellar metallicity distribution ,",
    "detection incompleteness is unimportant _ except _ at the extreme upper right corner of the cmd , where the very reddest and brightest rgb stars fall near the completeness cutoff determined by the @xmath14 filter .",
    "as will be seen below , these reddest stars are likely to have above - solar heavy - element abundances ; they are redder than the old - rgb populations in any previously observed globular clusters , dwarf galaxies , or halos of larger galaxies . despite our deliberately planned exposure times in @xmath14 , which were considerably longer than in @xmath15 ( and our usage of the `` wide @xmath14 '' f606w filter rather than the more nearly standard f555w )",
    ", we may still be missing some fraction of the very reddest rgb stars . in the discussion below on the metallicity distribution",
    ", we explicitly include the effects of incompleteness as far as the data allow .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that if the outer bulge of ngc 5128 does contain stars well above solar metallicity , our data are not capable of detecting most of them . such objects ,",
    "if they exist , will have to be searched for with longer - wavelength @xmath33 imaging , such as with the nicmos camera ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the derivation of stellar metallicities follows the procedure developed in paper ii : briefly , we superimpose a stellar model grid on the cmd and interpolate within it to calculate a heavy - element abundance @xmath34 for each star .",
    "our adopted metallicity index is then by definition [ m / h ] = log @xmath35 .",
    "the main stellar model grid is that of @xcite , which provides fiducial rgb evolutionary tracks in metallicity intervals of roughly 0.1 dex in log @xmath34 from @xmath36 up to @xmath37 .",
    "solar metallicity is adopted as @xmath38 .",
    "however , a significant fraction of the stars in our inner - halo sample are more metal - rich than this , and particular attention needs to be paid to extending the grid to higher @xmath34 .",
    "unfortunately , it is precisely this high@xmath39 regime which is fraught with the greatest uncertainty in every direction . in paper ii , we used two metal - rich isochrone lines from @xcite ( @xmath40 ) to extend the grid .",
    "however , these have scaled - solar element ratios and are thus fundamentally not compatible with contemporary @xmath41enhanced models .",
    "this issue had little relevance for the outer - halo fields ( papers i and ii ) because these fields did not have many stars which extended into the high@xmath39 range , but for our inner - halo data the question is more pressing .",
    "stars with [ @xmath42/fe ] @xmath43 are hotter than ones with scaled - solar ratios because of their lower opacities , and simple renormalization of the total @xmath34 becomes risky particularly at high metallicity @xcite .",
    "ideally , we would like to employ a grid of rgb models which is ( a ) computed with full @xmath41enhancement , ( b ) extends to at least @xmath44 , ( c ) is densely spaced in log @xmath34 , and ( d ) also properly accounts for any progressive change in [ @xmath42/fe ] with metallicity itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such material is not yet available .",
    "recently @xcite have published metal - rich and @xmath41enhanced isochrones for a widely spaced grid of heavy - element values @xmath45 . however , at least in the upper - rgb luminosity range which we require , the theoretical @xmath46 colors of all these tracks are significantly bluer for a given metallicity compared with the @xcite models , as well as ( more importantly ) the real star clusters that we use to calibrate the grid ( see below ) .",
    "a more finely spaced grid of metal - rich models is available from @xcite , but these are calculated for scaled - solar abundances . for the present we are forced to adopt an alternate procedure .",
    "our approach is a continuation of the one we adopted in paper ii : instead of relying solely on theoretically computed color indices , we pin the model tracks as closely as possible to the rgb loci and abundances of real milky way clusters . at low @xmath34 , this method works handily because there are many well observed globular clusters with low metallicities , low reddenings , and accurate rgb loci in the @xmath47 plane .",
    "the five which we use to cover the range from [ m / h ] @xmath48 up to [ m / h ] @xmath49 are m15 , ngc 6397 , ngc 6752 , ngc 1851 , and ngc 104 ( 47 tuc ) . at higher @xmath34 ,",
    "the situation is considerably worse .",
    "the two metal - rich objects we rely on , out of sheer necessity , are the bulge globular cluster ngc 6553 and the very old disk cluster ngc 6791 .",
    "ngc 6553 is generally thought to have essentially solar heavy - element abundance @xcite with [ fe / h ] @xmath50 and [ @xmath42/fe ] @xmath51 .",
    "ngc 6791 is generally thought to have [ fe / h ] @xmath52 with little or no @xmath41enhancement @xcite , but see @xcite for a healthy discussion of concerns .",
    "both clusters have observational handicaps that are much more serious than in the low@xmath39 regime : ngc 6553 is both heavily reddened and differentially reddened , while ngc 6791 has an age which is younger than the standard globular clusters by @xmath53 gy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to work around these difficulties",
    ", we have taken the yale scaled - solar tracks @xcite and have used them to define the _ shapes _ of the tracks in the @xmath47 plane near @xmath54 . while the yale models use @xmath55 . at the level of accuracy needed for our purposes ,",
    "this difference is negligible . ] for ngc 6791 , we adopt a fiducial value @xmath56 and use the models to find that we must shift its upper rgb 0.15 mag redder in @xmath57 to correct it to an age 2 gy older . this adjusted locus , by definition , is the uppermost boundary of the metallicity sequence we can use at present .",
    "lastly , we also interpolate within the models to define a track at @xmath58 , in between ngc 6553 and ngc 6791 .",
    "the complete array of fiducial tracks and star clusters that we have adopted is shown in figure [ calibration ] .",
    "the fiducial points for ngc 6553 , for which @xmath59 , fall slightly redder than the most metal - rich vandenberg et al .",
    "track at @xmath37 , and the raw ngc 6791 sequence ( not corrected for age differences ) lies as it should between the tracks for @xmath58 and 0.045 .",
    "it is obvious that these observational constraints on the high@xmath39 part of the grid , from ngc 104 up to ngc 6791 , are very thin indeed and that our current definition of this part of the grid is only a stopgap measure . with further careful observations of selected globular clusters",
    ", it may be possible to add one or two more fiducial sequences in this range , but particularly urgent attention is needed to the computation of appropriate models .",
    "we emphasize once again that _ the extension of this interpolation grid above solar metallicity is the most uncertain part of our data analysis_.      once the model grid is defined , we interpolate linearly within it , in the manner described in paper ii , to estimate the metallicity of each star .",
    "compared with the previous analysis of paper ii , we have modified the interpolation code to add minor improvements in the calculation of bolometric correction and the ability of the code to use stars closer to the rgb tip . for purposes of homogeneity",
    ", we have therefore recalculated the mdfs for all three of our program fields ( 8 , 21 , and 31 kpc ) through the same updated routine .    as part of the interpolation routine",
    "we also compute an uncertainty @xmath60 in the abundance for each star , generated by the random photometric error in magnitude and color at its position in the cmd .",
    "these uncertainties are determined numerically by simply adding @xmath61 and @xmath62 to the given @xmath20 for the star and recalculating @xmath34 . in practice ,",
    "the size of @xmath60 is determined almost entirely by the scatter in color , @xmath62 , because the rgb evolutionary tracks are nearly vertical in the bolometric cmd and so small shifts in magnitude alone do not affect the resulting mdf .",
    "the data for our 8-kpc field , superimposed on the rgb model tracks , are redisplayed in figure [ cmd_bol ] in the @xmath63 plane within which the interpolation process is actually carried out .",
    "the resulting histograms in [ m / h ] , divided somewhat arbitrarily into three luminosity bins , are shown in figures [ mh2131_histo ] and [ mh8_histo ] . revisiting the combined mdf for the two outer fields ( figure [ mh2131_histo ] )",
    ", we see in all bins a broad peak near [ m / h ] @xmath64 , a steep decrease toward higher metallicity , and a longer tail toward lower metallicity .",
    "there are nearly negligible numbers of stars either more metal - poor than [ m / h ] @xmath65 ( which is , notably , the metallicity range including _ most _ of the halo stars in the milky way ) or more metal - rich than [ m / h ] @xmath66 . in the fainter luminosity bins , the mdf becomes more spread - out due to the increasing photometric scatter , but the peak location and general distribution shape remain the same at all magnitudes .    for our 8-kpc field",
    "( figure [ mh8_histo ] ) the patterns are not quite the same . as we expected from the raw cmd ,",
    "the populations in all the bins have higher proportions of metal - rich stars compared with their outer - halo counterparts , but the fainter bins shift progressively further to the metal - rich side .",
    "this trend apparently violates the requirement of internal self - consistency , i.e.  that the mdf for the same population of stars should be independent of the luminosity range sampled .",
    "however , the highly consistent results from the outer fields ( figure [ mh2131_histo ] ) indicate that the problem is not an artifact of the interpolation routine or the model grid itself .",
    "a large part of the explanation is likely to be the detection incompleteness for extremely red stars , which will affect the highest - luminosity bins somewhat more because the rgb stars there ( see fig .",
    "1 ) lie closer to the completeness cutoff line than do equally metal - rich stars a magnitude further down the giant branch .    to take partial account of incompleteness effects , we recalculate completeness - corrected mdfs for both the inner and outer fields ( where now each star is counted as @xmath67 , the inverse of the photometric completeness at that point on the cmd ; to avoid wild excursions in the mdf we arbitrarily set the maximum correction factor at 2.0 ) . from figure [ mh8_histo ]",
    ", it is evident that the metal - richer side of the distribution is enhanced as a result , and more so in the higher - luminosity bins .",
    "for the outer halo , incompleteness is much less important because the rgb does not reach far enough to the red to be strongly affected . for @xmath68values lower than @xmath69 ,",
    "completeness effects become poorly understood and very risky to apply .",
    "we regard the corrected histograms in figure  [ mh8_histo ] only as an informed guess at the red - end shape of the mdf , and not a substitute for raw data that reach appropriately deeper in the first place .",
    "lastly , we note that the fainter bins become progressively more affected not only by photometric spread but also by unrecoverable systematic errors : higher and higher fractions of the bluer stars are driven by photometric scatter out of the model grid entirely , but the stars driven to the red side by the same photometric random scatter stay within the grid and skew the resulting mdf to higher metallicity . see paper ii for more discussion . in what follows",
    ", we restrict our discussion to the brightest interval @xmath70 which is least affected by this combination of errors and uncertainties .",
    "our final completeness - corrected histograms for the inner and outer fields are summarized in table 1 and shown in figure [ 2histo ] .",
    "regardless of the level of completeness corrections , the inner - field mdf is clearly more metal - rich on average , and extends to higher maximum metallicity , than the outer halo .",
    "as we discussed in paper ii , a physically natural way to display the mdf which is easily connected to chemical evolution models , is as the number of stars per unit heavy - element abundance , @xmath71 .",
    "the numbers in table 1 can readily be converted to this alternate form , but while we are at it , we can also partially compensate for the effects of random photometric errors .",
    "define @xmath72 as the probability of finding stars at a given abundance @xmath34 as follows :    @xmath73    in this expression , each star is replaced by a small gaussian centered at its measured abundance @xmath74 and with dispersion @xmath75 equal to the uncertainty in its calculated heavy - element abundance @xmath34 . as before , @xmath30 is the detection incompleteness at the star s location in the cmd .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath76 is chosen to set @xmath77 over all @xmath34 .",
    "the probability distributions @xmath78 for the inner and outer fields are shown in figure [ zdf ] .",
    "the curve for the outer fields is smooth and featureless , reaching a peak at @xmath34(max ) @xmath79 ( compare fig .  13 from paper ii , where basically the same material is plotted in raw histogram form ) .",
    "by contrast , the curve for the inner field is extremely broad , declining slowly from a peak at @xmath80 toward levels that extend well above solar abundance .",
    "we emphasize again , however , that its extension at high @xmath34 is uncertain , as indicated by the difference between the completeness - corrected and uncorrected curves shown in figure [ zdf ] .",
    "we will use these distributions as the basis for some brief modelling discussions in section 4 below .      in any representation ,",
    "the mdf for our 8 kpc field is plainly more extended , more metal - rich , and more complex than the outer - halo mdf .",
    "the inner mdf is likely to be broader because it is made up of a wider mixture of subcomponents from different parts of the galaxy .",
    "the effective radius of the bulge light is @xmath81 @xcite , corresponding to @xmath82 kpc .",
    "our 8-kpc field is threfore only @xmath83 from the center , and so a significant contribution from the inner bulge of the galaxy should be present in our mdf .",
    "if we now _ assume _ that our inner - field mdf is made up of two major components ( bulge and halo ) , _ and _ that the halo component is similar to the outer - field mdf , we can subtract one from the other to gain a first , albeit very rough , look at the mdf for the `` pure bulge '' component of ngc 5128 . to normalize the outer - field population to the inner one",
    ", we use the metal - poor parts of the two mdfs where we can plausibly expect the halo components to dominate . in figure",
    "[ ratio_inout ] , we plot the ratio of numbers of stars in each field _ more metal - poor _ than a given cutoff metallicity [ m / h ] . for any cutoff in the range [ m / h ] @xmath84 , this ratio stays roughly constant at @xmath85 , indicating that the two mdfs match up well over that range . at higher metallicities , the proportion of inner - field stars rises steadily and",
    "the two mdfs no longer match one another .    in figure [ diff_histo ]",
    ", we show the result of subtracting one component from the other .",
    "the lower panel gives the residual , equal to ( @xmath86 ) ( where both mdfs here are the completeness - corrected versions ) .",
    "the halo component ( [ m / h ] @xmath87 ) has now subtracted cleanly away , and the remaining metal - rich part , by hypothesis , represents the stars belonging to the outer bulge of the galaxy .",
    "this residual mdf , rising steadily from [ m / h ] @xmath88 up to near - solar abundance , shows a broad peak and roughly symmetric shape , but as indicated above , it probably still underestimates the numbers of stars with above - solar metallicity because of the inadequately understood incompleteness effects of the photometry .",
    "the formal mean and standard deviation of the residual `` bulge '' mdf as shown here are @xmath89m / h@xmath90 and @xmath91(m / h ) @xmath92 dex . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite find that the bulge metallicities for a large sample of other elliptical galaxies , determined from integrated - light spectral indices , lie in the typical range [ m / h ] @xmath93 to + 0.3 with an average at + 0.08 ( we quote here their determinations for the integrated light within ( @xmath94 ) ; their `` core '' metallicities within ( @xmath95 ) are slightly more metal - enhanced at @xmath89m / h@xmath96 ) . given the presence of a modest metallicity gradient , our result for ngc 5128 , measured further out in the bulge at @xmath97 , appears to be quite consistent with their quoted range .",
    "a comparison with the milky way bulge is also possible .",
    "the mean metallicity of the old milky way bulge stars within @xmath98 kpc ( corresponding to about half the classic effective radius ) is at a very similar level : for example , @xcite find @xmath89fe / h@xmath99 for five fields within @xmath100 latitude ( 0.4 kpc ) along the minor axis .",
    "@xcite find @xmath89fe / h@xmath101 for 11 bulge giants at moderately low latitude , and @xcite find that the mdf for four milky way bulge fields peaks at [ fe / h ] @xmath102 .",
    "thus our tentative findings for the ngc 5128 ` bulge' fall very much in line with the ranges observed in other elliptical and spiral bulges .",
    "the eventual aim of obtaining the metallicity distribution of the stellar population is to help place constraints on the evolutionary history of ngc 5128 .",
    "both theoretical modelling and recent observations suggest that giant ellipticals are likely to form or grow by a mixture of different processes including hierarchical merging of gas clouds in the early universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and nondissipative , hierarchical merging of stellar fragments ( e.g. ct et al .  1998 , 2000 , 2001 ) . which of these processes dominates for any particular ge almost certainly depends strongly on its environment and individual history .",
    "matching our data with some of these advanced modelling codes is far beyond the scope of the present paper . we will discuss a specific comparison with one of the semianalytical codes for hierarchical merging , galform @xcite , in a later paper @xcite . for the present ,",
    "in this section we briefly discuss a much simpler chemical evolution model capable of generating the first - order features of the mdfs that we observe .",
    "the basic picture we adopt is one of hierarchical formation , in which the bulk of the stars in the halo are assumed to form at relatively early epochs within many gas - rich clouds that merged to build up the ( eventual ) giant elliptical .",
    "that is , the mdf is the result of a _ large number of individual star - forming events _ within these smaller clouds and within the growing potential well of the ge .",
    "this is almost the opposite view from what we adopted in the previous section , i.e.  that the mdfs that we see in these three fields resulted from a single series of _ in situ _ star - forming events , rather than from two rather distinct subcomponents .      as we argued in paper ii",
    ", perhaps the most interesting feature of the mdf is the striking lack of low - metallicity stars in either the inner or outer halos .",
    "a classic closed - box model of chemical evolution with initial gas abundance @xmath103 and nucleosynthetic effective yield @xmath104 leads to an mdf with a characteristic exponential - decay shape @xmath105 . without highly arbitrary adjustments to the assumed star formation rates or the imf",
    ", these basic models do not produce the steep rise in the number of stars at low @xmath34 ( see again fig .",
    "10 , and see paper ii and references cited there for more discussion of the alternatives ) .",
    "an alternate and almost equally simple class of models is the `` accreting - box '' type , within which new gas is added to the `` box '' after each round of star formation ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a more intuitive way to state",
    "this is simply to visualize that the many protogalactic clouds , which start with primordial unenriched gas , are all busily forming stars within their own small potential wells while they are simultaneously merging together .",
    "that is , the merger epoch does not wait until after the protogalactic clouds have completed their own local star formation , nor do the small clouds wait until they have merged before beginning star formation .",
    "to some degree , both steps must be happening at once .    to quantify this approach in a straightforward way , assume ( following the notation of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the box has gas mass @xmath106 and stellar mass @xmath107 at any time @xmath108 , and that star formation proceeds in discrete timesteps @xmath109 , within each of which a small fraction @xmath110 of the gas forms into stars . of the mass @xmath111 of newly formed stars , a fraction @xmath42 stays locked up in stellar remnants and the remainder @xmath112 is returned to the interstellar medium , partially enriched by the products of nucleosynthesis . as usual ,",

    "this disparity is all the more puzzling , given the strong evidence for a global cluster formation efficiency of about 0.25% by mass that is remarkably similar in large galaxies of all types and sizes @xcite .",
    "for globular cluster systems there are at least three different kinds of `` specific frequency problems '' .",
    "the first of these , uncovered more than two decades ago , is the correlation of @xmath3 with e galaxy luminosity and the existence of central - supergiant galaxies ( m87 and others like it ) with strikingly large cluster populations . a plausible solution to this issue",
    "@xcite is that the @xmath3 values become much more nearly uniform when normalized to the total masses of the host galaxies including their x - ray halo gas .",
    "a second and almost equally old `` specific frequency problem '' is the overall large range in @xmath3 amongst rich cluster ellipticals , field ellipticals , and spirals ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "understanding the origin of this range and variety is likely to involve numerous details of their formation histories including environmental factors such as the tendency of spiral / spiral mergers to form low@xmath8 `` field '' ellipticals .",
    "the correlation between @xmath3 and metallicity which we raise here is a third fundamental kind of `` specific frequency problem '' , and presents a new challenge to our understanding of the link between globular clusters and halo stars .",
    "much observational and theoretical evidence indicates that ( a ) star clusters form within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , with perhaps a handful of clusters forming within any one gmc , and that ( b ) the typical masses of the protoclusters are about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the total mass of the parent gmc itself @xcite .",
    "the mean mass ratio @xmath182 derived by @xcite corresponds to a baseline specific frequency @xmath183 and is , in this hypothesis , the average mass ratio @xmath184 of clusters formed within a typical gmc .",
    "star clusters with masses @xmath185 ( that is , globular clusters ) should then form within gmcs of masses @xmath186 .",
    "gmc masses in this range make them easily identifiable with protogalactic subsystems such as the ly@xmath42 clouds @xcite , the supergiant molecular clouds of @xcite , or the small cool - gas disks of @xcite which merge hierarchically to build larger galaxies at the same time as they are forming their own embedded star clusters .    as did @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", we imagine a sequence of events in which the first major round of globular cluster and star formation took place within these dwarf - galaxy - sized gas clouds , scattered throughout the much larger potential well of the giant proto - elliptical .",
    "these first clusters and field stars took on the low metallicities of their primordial host clouds .",
    "as the clouds merged hierarchically , later continuous rounds of star formation took place in which the progressively more enriched gas formed the metal - richer clusters and field stars .",
    "but some additional feature of the story is needed to force the ratio of field stars to globular clusters steadily upward ( or conversely , to push @xmath3 steadily downward ) in these later rounds of star formation , as the evidence of fig .",
    "19 would indicate .",
    "we suggest that this additional feature may be the relative timing of globular cluster formation _ versus _ their associated field stars .",
    "if the clusters , which should form out of the densest , most massive , or highest - pressure clumps of gas within their host gmcs , are constructed _ soonest _ in the sequence  that is , ahead of the majority of the field stars  then the effective @xmath3 emerging from the entire gmc will depend on when the star formation history is truncated .",
    "earlier versions of this idea were suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the essential concept is illustrated schematically in figure [ schematic ] .",
    "within a given protogalactic cloud ( supergiant gmc ) , the clusters are envisaged to form predominantly near the beginning of the gmc s history . by contrast , the general star formation distributed everywhere throughout the cloud in less dense local regions and at lower conversion efficiency is assumed to take longer to ramp up and then die away .",
    "a `` normal '' specific frequency ( number of clusters per unit field - star mass ) would result if the host gmc is able to complete its full sequence of star formation ( in fig .",
    "20 , up to time t1 ) . however , _",
    "if the normal sequence is truncated at an earlier time _ @xmath187  for example , if the gmc itself is disrupted and its remaining gas ejected  then the net specific frequency can be considerably larger : the same number of globular clusters is still present , having formed very early on , but most of the general stellar population does not get a chance to form .",
    "this premature truncation of the internal enrichment and star formation is exactly what would be expected for isolated protogalactic clouds of masses @xmath188 : as first calculated by @xcite , the initial major round of supernovae and stellar winds in such dwarf - galaxy - sized systems would be sufficient to drive the rest of the gas out of their modest potential wells and terminate any further star formation .",
    "a prediction emerging from this combined picture is that dwarf ellipticals , which can plausibly be viewed to have evolved from single protogalactic clouds in isolation , should have progressively larger specific frequencies for smaller dwarfs ( in addition , of course , to the long - established observational trend that smaller dwarfs should have lower mean metallicity ) .",
    "the available @xmath3 data for de galaxies @xcite are strongly consistent with this prediction , as shown by @xcite . the smallest de",
    ", n systems have @xmath3 reaching the remarkably high range @xmath189 ( though with considerable scatter ) , while the largest dwarfs have @xmath3 more consistently at `` normal '' levels of @xmath190 ( see the discussions of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another piece of observational evidence that is , perhaps , related to this picture is that very high specific frequencies or specific luminosities have been derived for some starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cluster - to - field - star ratio very early in the burst will look nominally larger than normal if the clusters form preferentially earlier .",
    "nevertheless , it is intriguing that most such systems ( see * ? ? ? * for a compilation ) have specific luminosities at the 1% level or less , comparable with the `` universal '' 0.25% efficiency ratio for old cluster systems .",
    "we suggest that the high @xmath3 levels exhibited at _ low metallicities in giant galaxies _",
    "19 and the discussion above ) may be the result of the same basic phenomenon . at early times , the protogalactic dwarfs were dispersed widely enough that they could , for a short time , evolve almost in isolation .",
    "they formed metal - poor clusters and some stars , but then ejected most of their gas , leaving behind a low - metallicity but high@xmath8 stellar population . the large amount of leftover gas then re - collected in the much bigger potential well of the giant galaxy as hierarchical merging continued , so that in the later rounds of star formation most of the gas could be kept _ in situ _ and the star formation could run to completion , yielding a normal ratio of clusters to field stars .    in this admittedly speculative picture , the overall level of heavy - element enrichment is still closely connected with chronology within any one gmc .",
    "if the later rounds of star formation behave the same way as the first round ( that is , if globular clusters form soonest within any gmc regardless of its initial metallicity ) , then we would expect that _ the highest - metallicity field stars in the bulge of the galaxy should be more metal - rich than the highest - metallicity globular clusters_. in other words , the mdf for the field - star population should extend to a higher `` top end '' than that of the clusters . in ngc 5128 , it should be possible to test this prediction with a more comprehensive set of cluster data , along with efforts to extend the field - star mdf to higher metallicity limits than we were able to do in the present study .",
    "if the timing argument we have outlined above proves to be wrong , then the obvious alternative is to invoke an intrinsic dependence of cluster formation efficiency on metallicity .",
    "that is , we would in that case assume that the very low@xmath39 protogalactic clouds inhabiting the early universe converted their gas into dense , bound star clusters about 3 times more efficiently than did the later generations of gmcs which had been enriched to levels higher than about one - tenth solar abundance .",
    "a third possibility , recently revived by @xcite , would be to assume arbitrarily that the lowest - metallicity clusters were formed in the early _ pregalactic _ universe by way of a fundamentally different route ( in cen s model , at the epoch of cosmological reionization ) .",
    "this latter route appears to us to be much less attractive since it does not relate to any currently visible evidence for star and cluster formation in gmcs , nor does it explain the otherwise - similar properties of globular clusters ( mass distribution functions , structural parameters ) at all metallicities and in all types of galaxies .",
    "we present new hst / wfpc2 photometry in @xmath0 for a starfield 8 kpc from the center of the nearby giant e galaxy ngc 5128 . by using a grid of red - giant evolutionary tracks finely spaced in metallicity",
    ", we convert the color - magnitude diagram of the stellar population into a metallicity distribution function , and combine it with the mdfs for our previously analyzed outer - halo fields at 21 and 31 kpc distance ( papers i and ii ) .    in all three fields , the cmd is completely dominated by a conventionally `` old '' ( many gy ) stellar population of red giants , with moderately high mean metallicity @xmath89m / h@xmath191 and very few low - metallicity stars like the ones dominating the milky way halo .",
    "however , the innermost of our three fields is distinctly more metal - rich than the outer ones ; if we arbitrarily view it as consisting of two sub - populations ( a halo component like the outer fields , plus a bulge component ) , then the `` bulge '' by itself has a mean metallicity [ m / h ] @xmath2 , similar to bulge compositions in many other large elliptical and spiral galaxies .",
    "we find that a simple accreting - box chemical evolution model that assumes a gas infall rate that is initially rapid but then declines exponentially with time is capable of closely matching the mdf of the outer - halo fields , as long as the infall gas has low metallicity ( [ m / h ] @xmath192 or less ) and the effective nucleosynthetic yield is @xmath193 .",
    "the same type of model with @xmath194 can also match the inner - halo field .",
    "finally , we compare our field - star mdfs to the mdf for the old globular clusters in ngc 5128 , with both samples divided into inner and outer regions . in both regions , there is a striking increase of net specific frequency ( number of clusters per unit halo field - star numbers ) at low [ fe / h ] , with the lowest - metallicity bins having 3 times more clusters per unit halo light than the highest - metallicity bins .",
    "we suggest that a way to explain this trend , within the context of a hierarchical - merging formation picture , is that globular clusters form preferentially sooner within any one starburst than the accompanying field stars . the first clusters to form were in relatively isolated , small , low@xmath39 protogalactic clouds , which ejected most of their gas after the first round of star formation , leaving behind a population of low - metallicity clusters and only a few field stars . in the later rounds of star formation",
    "after the merging process had advanced much further , the sites of star and cluster formation were in the much deeper potential well of the emerging giant elliptical .",
    "they could thus hold onto much higher fractions of their gas , allowing star formation to run to completion and producing proportionally larger numbers of high - metallicity stars for each globular cluster .",

    "<S> wfpc2 @xmath0 photometry for field stars in ngc 5128 at a projected distance of 8 kpc from the galaxy center , which probe a mixture of its inner halo and outer bulge . </S>",
    "<S> the color - magnitude diagram shows an old red - giant branch which is even broader in color than our two previously studied outer - halo fields ( at 21 and 31 kpc ) , with significant numbers of stars extending to solar metallicity and higher . </S>",
    "<S> the peak frequency of the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) is at [ m / h ] @xmath1 , with even fewer metal - poor stars than in the outer - halo fields . </S>",
    "<S> if we use the 21- and 31-kpc fields to define template `` halo '' mdfs and subtract these from the 8-kpc field , the residual `` bulge '' population has a mean [ m / h ] @xmath2 , similar to the bulges of other large spirals and ellipticals . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the main features of the halo mdf can be reproduced by a simple chemical evolution model in which early star formation goes on simultaneously with an initial stage of rapid infall of very metal - poor gas , after which the infall dies away exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> finally , by comparison with the mdfs for the ngc 5128 globular clusters , we find that in all the halo fields we have studied , there is a clear decrease of specific frequency @xmath3 ( number of clusters per unit halo light ) with increasing metallicity . at the lowest - metallicity range ( [ fe / h ] @xmath4 ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is @xmath5 , while at metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath6 it has dropped to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this trend may indicate that globular cluster formation efficiency is a strong function of the metallicity of the protocluster gas . </S>",
    "<S> however , we suggest an alternate possibility , which is that globular clusters form preferentially sooner than field stars . </S>",
    "<S> if most of the cluster formation within a host giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) takes place sooner than most of the distributed field - star formation , and if the earliest , most metal - poor star - forming clouds are prematurely disrupted by their own first bursts of star formation , then they would leave relatively few field stars with a high@xmath8 population . the high specific frequency at low metallicity </S>",
    "<S> may therefore be related to the comparably large @xmath3 values found in the most metal - poor dwarf ellipticals . </S>"
