    "as a complement to the studies at high - energy frontier , measurements at the intensity frontier ( or precision frontier ) provide powerful tools in the search for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "observables such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment are measured to very high precision , and experimental results are then compared with theoretical predictions . to the extent that the latter are sufficiently reliable , any possible deviation would point to bsm physics .",
    "alternately , these experiments can provide new insights into the dynamics of the standard model .",
    "electron - deuteron parity violating deep inelastic scattering ( @xmath0d pvdis ) is an excellent example of this class of studies .",
    "historically , it provided the first experimental measurement of weak mixing angle @xmath1 @xcite . nowadays , with the prospect of the jefferson laboratory 12-gev upgrade and the use of a new spectrometer called solid , the left - right asymmetry of pvdis can be measured with 0.5% precision over the kinematic range @xmath2 @xcite . with this level of precision ,",
    "one will be able to probe or constrain an interesting set of bsm scenarios , such as a leptophobic z boson@xcite and supersymmetry@xcite , as well as to study hadronic physics effects which are yet to be fully understood , such as charge symmetry violation ( cvc ) and higher - twist ( ht ) .",
    "the effect of ht @xcite is a potentially important standard model correction that originates from the interaction between partons .",
    "this correction in general scales as @xmath3 , with the twist @xmath4 , so its effect is enhanced at low @xmath5 . in the framework of the operator product expansion ( ope ) , the higher - twist correction can be expressed as a convolution of a high - energy and low - energy piece ; the former ( embodied in the wilson coefficients ) can be calculated using perturbative methods , whereas the latter involves hadronic matrix elements that require understanding of non - perturbative qcd . studying the higher - twist correction may help us in probing correlations between the confined quarks and gluons inside the nucleon , so it is interesting to explore ht matrix elements within various model approaches .",
    "one advantage of @xmath0d pvdis process is that the ht contribution to the leading term in the pv asymmetry ( defined below ) arises from a single operator matrix element and can , in principle , be separated kinematically from the subleading terms that have a more complicated ht structure . with this motivation in mind , several previous works @xcite have been carried out to study the twist - four ( i.e. @xmath6 ) correction to the left - right asymmetry of @xmath0d pvdis . in",
    "what follows , we report on a study that follows - up these earlier works .",
    "the study of ht may also shed light on another important issue , namely , the spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "nearly twenty - five years ago , the emc collaboration @xcite performed a dis experiment with longitudinally - polarized muons on a target of longitudinally - polarized protons , obtaining a value for the structure function @xmath7 over the range @xmath8 . after extrapolating to the low- and high-@xmath9 region , the collaboration obtained a value for the leading moment of @xmath7 that contradicted the ellis - jaffe sum rule @xcite and implied that that the spin of proton is not built up entirely from the quark spin",
    "the result has been confirmed by a variety of subsequent studies .",
    "a key question in nuclear physics research has , thus , become explaining in detail the source of nucleon spin in terms of qcd degrees of freedom .    from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "arriving at a decomposition of the nucleon spin in terms of gauge - invariant matrix elements of local operators that afford a straightforward partonic interpretation has been a vexing problem , and different approaches have been pursued over the years@xcite . in each case , reference is usually made to the interpretation in the light - cone ",
    "gauge dependence notwithstanding  given its historical importance for thinking about parton dynamics .",
    "however , while the meaning of the quark helicity is gauge invariant , the relative importance of other aspects of partonic angular momentum ( gluon helicity and quark and gluon orbital angular momentum ) in general vary with the choice of gauge and even definition .",
    "nonetheless , it is interesting to ask how different observables may probe different aspects of partonic angular momentum and to do so in a way that is both gauge - invariant and as insensitive as possible to a particular angular momentum decomposition .    in this respect",
    ", we will study ht in the context of light - cone quantization .",
    "in early work within this framework , it has been shown that one particular component of parton angular momentum  identified as quark orbital angular momentum ( oam ) under light - cone quantization using light - cone gauge  is responsible for the non - zero value of sivers function and boer - mulders function @xcite in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) @xcite . in light of these results , it is also interesting to study how the inclusion of the same component of parton angular momentum modifies the current model predictions for ht corrections to @xmath0d pvdis .",
    "indeed , in all the previous studies of @xmath0d pvdis , only the fock component of the nucleon wavefunction with zero parton oam has been included .    after including quark oam in the light - cone amplitudes",
    ", we observe a rather non - intuitive phenomenon : although the absolute magnitude of individual non - zero quark oam contributions can be significant , they largely cancel against each other .",
    "we will argue that this cancelation is largely independent of the detailed model for the relevant light - cone amplitudes . as a result , the twist - four correction to pvdis is almost transparent to the inclusion of quark oam . in contrast , other hadronic quantities , such as the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , sivers function , and boer - mulders function , manifest non - negligible dependence on quark oam .",
    "generalizing from the particular choice of light - cone quantization and light - cone gauge , we thus conclude that whatever features of parton angular momentum are responsible for the observed behavior of the pdfs , sivers , and boer - mulders functions , they should have a relatively minor impact on the ht correction to @xmath0d pvdis of interest here .",
    "moreover , any deviation from the light - cone predictions obtained here and in previous works@xcite  should they be observed expermentally  would signal the importance of other aspects of parton angular momentum and/or higher fock space components of the nucleon wavefunction .",
    "the discussion of the computation leading to these observations is arranged in the following order : in section ii we summarize the relevant results of the general formulation of the twist - four correction to @xmath0d pvdis ; in section iii we introduce the light - cone wavefunction with quark oam - dependence ; in section iv we present the analytic expressions of the hadronic matrix elements needed for the twist-4 correction , and demonstrate the generic cancelation between non - zero quark oam components ; in section v we present the numerical results using one specific choice of nucleon wavefunction , and discuss their physical significance .",
    "detailed formulae appear in the appendix .",
    "kinematics of e - d pvdis : a deuteron of momentum @xmath10 interacts with an incoming electron of momentum @xmath11 via an exchange of a single photon or z - boson , and breaks into hadrons which are denoted collectively as @xmath12    here , we review the well - known results for the twist - four correction in @xmath0d pvdis . we will simply quote the central equations that are relevant to our study without any derivation and refer the reader to refs .",

    "( obe ) level , the leading parity - violating piece comes from the interference between photon and z - boson exchange diagrams ( see fig [ fig : dis ] ) .",

    "we concentrate on @xmath27 , namely the higher - twist correction to @xmath28 .",
    "bjorken and wolfenstein @xcite showed that , if one assumes isospin symmetry and neglects sea quark contributions , then there is only one matrix element that contributes to @xmath27 ( for a detailed review of these arguments in a more modern context , see ref .",
    "this observation significantly simplifies the theoretical interpretation of the asymmetry , allowing us to concentrate on one particular matrix element without needing to to disentangle the contributions from many different sources . in brief , the bjorken and wolfenstein argument works as follows : @xmath29 arises from the interference between the electromagnetic and weak neutral currents .",
    "first , one can decompose both currents into an isoscalar @xmath30 and an isovector @xmath31 term .",
    "the matrix elements of the @xmath32 cross - term vanishes because deuteron is an isosinglet .",
    "furthermore , at leading twist , we have @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 that enters hadronic tensor @xmath36 @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the mass of deuteron , is the only matrix element giving a ht correction to @xmath39 .",
    "below , we will compute the matrix element using an expansion of string operators @xcite in order to extract the twist - four piece ; the latter is expressed in terms of the deuteron twist - four distribution function @xmath40 , which will be computed in section iv .",
    "the main challenge in proceeding from is our ignorance of the details of the nucleon wavefunctions .",
    "as qcd is non - perturbative at the hadronic scale , analytical expressions for the wavefunctions are unknown . at present",
    ", lattice qcd can provide only ht contributions to structure function moments and not the @xmath9-dependence of the @xmath27 that is of interest to the solid experiment .",
    "consequently , one must turn to various models that seek to incorporate non - perturbative dynamics .",
    "previous works on @xmath27 include the use of mit bag model @xcite and isotropic light - cone wavefunctions that contain both quark and gluon fock components @xcite ; their results yield similar shapes for the @xmath9-dependence but differ somewhat in magnitude , with a maximum @xmath27 of @xmath41 at @xmath42 for @xmath43 , which is a little bit lower than the achievable precision level in the solid experiment .",

    ", we consider a spin - up proton .",
    "its three valence quarks can form a total helicity of @xmath44 ; therefore in order to keep the total proton spin in z - direction to be 1/2 we need to assign different z - component quark oam ( i.e. @xmath45 ) for different combinations .    a spin - up proton state , then",
