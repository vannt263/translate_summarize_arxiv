    "qcd phase transitions along the baryon density direction has attracted much attention recently since it was found that the color - superconducting gap can be of the order of @xmath4 @xcite and @xcite , which is two orders larger than early perturbative estimations @xcite . however , till now , there is no uniform framework discussing the phase structure in the wide region of chemical potential @xmath5 from about @xmath6 to @xmath7 .    in the idealized case at",
    "asymptotically high baryon densities , the color superconductivity with two massless flavors and the color - flavor - locking ( cfl ) phase with three degenerate massless quarks have been widely discussed from first principle qcd calculations , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "usually , the diagrammatic methods are used in the asymptotic densities .",
    "the green - function of the eight - component field and the gap equation were discussed in details in @xcite @xcite .",
    "neither current quark mass nor chiral condensate are necessary to be considered because they can be neglected compared with the very high fermi surface . at less - than - asymptotic densities , the corrections of non - zero quark mass to the pure cfl phase can be treated perturbatively by expanding the current quark mass around the chiral limit @xcite @xcite .    for physical applications , we are more interested in the moderate baryon density region , which may be related to the neutron stars and , in very optimistic cases even to heavy - ion collisions . usually , effective models such as instanton , as well as nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , are used .",
    "the model parameters are fixed in the qcd vacuum . in this region ,",
    "the usual way is to use the variational methods working out the gap equations from the thermodynamic potential @xcite-@xcite , except for @xcite and @xcite in the instanton model , where the quark propagator was evaluated explicitly , but the form is complicated .",
    "one of our main aims in this paper is to apply the green - function approach in the moderate baryon density region . to work out the phase structure from hadron phase to the color superconducting phase ,",
    "one should deal with the chiral condensate and diquark condensate simultaneously .",
    "because the chiral condensation contributes a dynamic quark mass , it is not reasonable any more in this density region to treat the quark mass term perturbatively , like in @xcite . by using the energy projectors for massive quark , we will evaluate the nambu - gorkov massive quark propagator , which will help us deal with the chiral and diquark condensate simultaneously .    in the normal phase ,",
    "the quarks in different colors are degenerate , while in the color breaking phase , it is natural to assume that the quarks involved in the diquark condensate are different from that not participating in the diquark condensate . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "different masses for the quarks which participate and not participate in the diquark condensate are introduced .",
    "however , we will see it difficult to get the mass expression for the quarks participating in the diquark condensate , because the particles and holes mix with each other and the elementary excitations are quasi - particles and quasi - holes near the fermi surface . in our case",
    ", the difference between quarks in different colors has been reflected by their propagators , we read the difference through calculating the quarks chiral condensate , but not trying to work out their masses . in the chiral limit , the chiral condensate disappears entirely in the color superconducting phase , it is not possible to investigate the influence of color breaking on quarks in different colors , so we will keep the current quark mass finite in this paper .    in the moderate baryon density region , people are interested in the question whether there exists a region where both the chiral symmetry and color symmetry are broken @xcite-@xcite . in the chiral limit",
    "it was found that the existence of the mixed broken phase depends on the coupling constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the quark anti - quark and diquark channels @xcite@xcite . in the case of small ratio of @xmath10 the calculations in the instanton model @xcite@xcite , njl model @xcite and",
    "random matrix model @xcite show a strong competition between the chiral and diquark condensates , i.e. , where one condensate is nonzero the other vanishes . while for @xmath11 the calculations in the random matrix model @xcite and njl model @xcite show that there exists a region where both chiral ( dynamical ) symmetry and color symmetry are broken , and the chiral and diquark condensate coexist .",
    "the larger value of @xmath12 is , the wider region of the mixed broken phase has been found in the random matrix model @xcite .",
    "the presence of a small current quark mass will induce that chiral symmetry only restores partially and there will always exist a mall chiral condensate in the color superconducting phase , this phenomena had been called coexistence of chiral and diquark condensates in @xcite@xcite . in order to differ from this coexistence of the diquark and the small chiral condensate induced by current quark mass , we will call the coexistence region of the diquark and large chiral condensate induced by large @xmath12 before the chiral phase transition as mixed broken phase .    in the coexistence region resulted by current quark mass , the chiral condensate is small comparing with the diquark condensate , and the role of the chiral condensate can be prescribed by the anderson theroem @xcite , i.e. , in this phase , the contribution of the chiral condensate to thermodynamic quantities becomes strongly suppressed , and one can calculate the diquark condensate neglecting the influence of the chiral condensate .    in this paper",
    ", we will explain the existence of the mixed broken phase induced by larger @xmath13 by analyzing the influence of the diquark condensate on the fermi surface .",
    "in the mean - field approximation of the njl model , the thermal system of the constituent quarks is a nearly ideal fermi gas , and there is a sharp fermi surface .",
    "the chiral symmetry begins to restore when the chemical potential is larger than the quark mass in the vacuum .",
    "when a diquark condensate is formed , the cooper pair extends the fermi surface , which induces the chiral symmetry restoring at a smaller chemical potential .",
    "the stronger the coupling constant in the diquark channel , the larger the diquark condensate and the smoother the fermi surface .    in the following ,",
    "we briefly introduce the extended njl model in sec .",
    "ii , then in sec iii , we evaluate the thermodynamic potential using the massive quark propogator . in sec .",
    "iv , we get the gap equations and condensates .",
    "the numerical results and conclusions are given at the end .",
    "the choice of the njl model @xcite is motivated by the fact that this model displays the same symmetries as qcd and that it describes well the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry in the vacuum and its restoration at high temperature and density .",
    "the model we used in this paper is an extended version of the two - flavor njl model including interactions in the color singlet quark - antiquark channel and color anti - triplet diquark channel , which is not directly extended from the njl model , but from the qcd lagrangian @xcite- @xcite .",
    "the importance of color @xmath14 diquark degree of freedom is related to the fact that one can construct a color - singlet nucleon current based on it . because the gluon exchange between two quarks in the color @xmath14 channel is attractive",
    ", one can view a color singlet baryon as a quark - diquark bound state . and",
    "experimental data from @xmath15 collisions indicate the existence of this quark - diquark component in nucleons .    the first attempt to investigate the diquark properties in the njl model",
    "was taken in @xcite .",
    "starting from an njl model for scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector interactions of the @xmath16 type and fierz - transforming away the vector and axial - vector interactions , the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons , and diquarks can be obtained . however",
    ", this method could not get a consistent treatment of vector and axial - vector particles .",
    "the extended njl model we used was derived directly from qcd lagrangian @xcite @xcite .",
    "integrating out gluon degrees of freedom from qcd lagrangian , and performing a local approximation for the ( nonperturbative ) gluon propagator , one gets a contact current - current interaction . by using a special fierz - rearrangement @xcite",
    ", one can completely decompose the two - quark - current interaction term into `` attractive '' color singlet ( @xmath17 ) and color antitriplet ( @xmath18 ) channels . in this way , a complete simultaneous description of scalar , pseudo - scalar , vector , and axial - vector mesons and diquarks is possible , thus the extended njl model including @xmath16 interactions is completed by a corresponding @xmath19 interaction part .    in our present work ,",
    "we only consider scalar , pseudoscalar mesons and scalar diquark , and using the following lagrangian density @xmath20   + g_d[(i { \\bar q}^c   \\varepsilon   \\epsilon^{b } \\gamma_5 q )     ( i { \\bar q } \\varepsilon \\epsilon^{b } \\gamma_5 q^c)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are charge - conjugate spinors , @xmath23 is the charge conjugation matrix ( the superscript @xmath24 denotes the transposition operation ) , @xmath25 is the current quark mass , the quark field @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 is a flavor doublet and color triplet , as well as a four - component dirac spinor , @xmath29 are pauli matrices in the flavor space , where @xmath30 is antisymmetric , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 are totally antisymmetric tensors in the flavor and color spaces .    in ( [ lagr ] ) , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are independent effective coupling constants in the scalar quark - antiquark and scalar diquark channel .",
    "the former is responsible for the meson excitations , and the later for the diquark excitations , which in principle can be determined by fitting mesons and baryons properties in the vacuum .",
    "the attractive interaction in different channels in this lagrangian will give rise to a very rich structure of the phase diagram .",
    "at zero temperature and density , the attractive interaction in the color singlet channel is responsible for the appearance of a quark anti - quark condensate and for the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry , and the interaction in the @xmath18 channel binds quarks into diquarks ( and baryons ) , but is not strong enough to induce diquark condensation .",
    "as the density increases , pauli blocking suppresses the @xmath17 interaction , while the attractive interaction in the color anti - triplet diquark channel will induce the quark - quark condensate around the fermi surface which can be identified as a superconducting phase .",

    "the competition starts at @xmath176 and ends at @xmath175 .",
