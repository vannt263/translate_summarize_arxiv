    "the einasto ( or ) function has the property that a single index ( @xmath7 or @xmath6 ) determines the distribution at both small and large radii .",

    "@xcite has proposed that profiles in which the central and outer slopes are anti - correlated arise naturally in the standard cosmological model with initial density fluctuations represented by a gaussian random field ( grf ) . when the fluctuation field is dominated by long - wavelength modes the system forms via a coherent collapse , leading to a profile shallow in the center and steep in the outskirts . when short - wavelength modes dominate , a steep dense central core is initially formed and late infall of substructures produces an extended envelope .",

    "in addition we fitted the final angle - averaged density distributions of all simulations ( including those of n15 ) with einasto profiles , using as an estimate of the half - mass radius @xmath13 the analytic approximation given by @xcite . in both cases we have only one free parameter ( either @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) and we consider the radial range @xmath17 .",
