    "the study of open quantum systems , in which the interaction of the quantum system with the environment is taken into account , is of fundamental importance in several areas of physics .",
    "one such area is quantum optics scully97a , where the quantum system may be an atom ( or an atom combined with a single mode laser field ) and the environment with which the atom interacts may be a continuum of quantised modes of the electromagnetic field ( or a set of vibrational modes in a solid ) .",
    "another area is quantum measurement theory @xcite , where the environment includes the macroscopic measuring apparatus , whose states `` record '' the results of measurements on the quantum system itself . explaining the emergence of the classical world @xcite is related to the way the presence of the environment destroys coherence between certain states of macroscopic systems , resulting in only the `` pointer states '' remaining stable  any quantum superpositions of pointer states are rapidly converted into mixed states .",
    "a third area is that of degenerate quantum gases @xcite , where the quantum system is an atomic bose - einstein condensate or atomic fermi gas , and the environment may consist of those atoms in thermally excited states , as distinct from being in the macroscopically occupied condensate state or in states within the fermi surface . as in some of these examples , the quantum system itself may be microscopic or macroscopic .    in many cases the interaction between the quantum system and the environment ( also referred to as the bath or reservoir ) involves coupling constants and reservoir mode densities that have a slowly varying frequency dependence . in such cases",
    "the reservoir structure function ( which is the product of the mode density with the square of the coupling constant ) is also slowly varying , resulting in the reservoir correlation time ( which is the inverse of the bandwidth for the reservoir structure function ) being very short compared to the time scales for dynamic evolution of the quantum system .",
    "this situation enables the dynamical behaviour of the quantum system and its interaction with the environment to be described by markovian master equations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a large literature exists where the dynamical behaviour of quantum systems coupled to the environment has been successfully explained via markovian master equations and related methods , and indeed much of quantum optics ( see @xcite ) falls into this category .    in recent years",
    "however , there has been an interest in open quantum systems where the conditions required for markovian behaviour do not necessarily apply .",
    "cases include atom lasers @xcite , quantum brownian motion @xcite , systems with conditioned evolution ( such as associated with photodetection ) @xcite , decoherence in large scale quantum computers @xcite and in macroscopic systems generally @xcite .",
    "a further non - markovian situation occurs for atomic systems coupled to structured reservoirs of electromagnetic ( em ) field modes , where either the coupling constants or the mode density ( or both ) change rapidly with frequency .",
    "this situation can occur for atoms in high - q cavities or in photonic band - gap ( pbg ) systems , and a general review of such situations is given by lambropoulos et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a number of methods for treating non - markovian problems have been formulated .",
    "these include : non - markovian master equations zwanzig64a , nakajima58a , dalton82a , barnett01a ; the time - convolutionless projection operator master equation @xcite ; heisenberg equations of motion @xcite ; stochastic wave function methods for non - markovian processes breuer99a , strunz99a , walls99a , molmer99a , john97a , imamoglu96a , strunz04a , wiseman03a , breuer04a ; methods based on the essential states approximation or resolvent operators @xcite ; the pseudomode approach @xcite ; fano diagonalisation fano61a , barnett00a ; and various short time scale methods braun01a , strunz03a , privman02a , privman03a , privman04b , duan97a , zagury01a .",
    "the last four approaches are less powerful in the formal sense , but often simpler to apply and interpret .    in recent work ( @xcite )",
    "we have studied non - markovian processes for atomic systems coupled to a structured reservoirs of em field modes , with applications to high - q cavities and pbg systems @xcite .",
    "our approach has been based on the essential states approximation , fano diagonalisation and pseudomodes . in ref.dalton03a",
    "the case of a three level _ cascade _ ( or ladder ) system coupled to a structured reservoir of em modes was treated using the essential states approach , following a method similar to @xcite .",
    "the general equations for the coupled amplitudes and their laplace transforms were obtained , and the resulting integral equation solved via numerical methods , based on discretising frequency space to give a matrix equation that is equivalent to the original integral equation and also utilising analytical continuation in the complex @xmath0 plane .",
    "the decay of the initially excited upper state was found as a function of time .",
    "our application in dalton03a was restricted to the case where the structured reservoir was due to a high - q cavity . in the present paper",
    ", we apply the same method also to the case where the structured reservoir is due to a model photonic band - gap .",
    "in addition some further high - q cavity cases are examined , where the cavity resonance is detuned from the atomic transition frequency .",
    "other non - markovian studies of the cascade system in a pbg system have been carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these papers",
    "a discontinuous mode density is used , whereas we represent the pbg by a difference of two lorentzian functions .",
    "quantitative comparisons between their results and ours are therefore not possible , only general features such as population trapping effects are in common .",
    "for completeness and to set out the notation , we include here in section [ sec : essential states theory ] the key integral equations for the cascade system decay , based on the essential states approach , that were derived in @xcite .",
    "results for both the high - q cavity and pbg cases are presented in section [ sec : applications ] .",
    "the dynamics is also treated via master equations by two different approaches , that is , involving either pseudomodes or quasimodes . in the master equation approach ,",
    "the atomic system is augmented by a small number of pseudomodes or quasimodes , which in the quasimode approach themselves undergo markovian relaxation into a flat reservoir of continuum quasimodes .",
    "the master equation theory is presented in section sec : me , with the pseudomode approach @xcite being described in subsection [ sec : pseudomode ] , and a treatment based on quasimodes @xcite given in subsection [ sec : quasimode ] .",
    "results from the master equation method are compared to those from the laplace transform method .",
    "a summary of the paper is set out in section sec : summary .",
    "the system consists of a three level cascade atom , shown in figure [ fig1 ] , coupled to a bath ( or reservoir ) of bosonic modes .",
    "the bath modes would usually be associated with the quantum em field , but other bosonic baths ( such as lattice vibrations in a solid ) might realise a similar model . for convenience , we will refer to the bath quanta as photons , but other quanta could be involved ( such as phonons in the lattice vibration case )",

    "we also define a frequency offset @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 the offset determines the energy difference between the two transitions .",
    "if the offset is large , we would expect the system to behave as though there are two independent reservoirs .",
    "however , for relatively small offsets a photon may well be emitted from one transition , and later re - absorbed on the other transition .",
    "the bath modes have frequencies @xmath5 , raising and lowering operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the density of modes is @xmath8 .",
    "frequency dependent coupling constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 specify the coupling between atomic transitions @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the reservoir .    the hamiltonian for the system in the rotating wave approximation is given by : @xmath13 \\biggr ] .   \\label{eq : hamil}\\end{aligned}\\]]initially the atom is assumed to be in the upper state @xmath14 and the bath modes are empty of photons , so the initial state vector is @xmath15the atom plus bath system evolves according to the schrdinger equation .",
    "the initial state assumed together with the rotating wave approximation allows for the atomic state @xmath16 to be coupled to one photon bath states and atomic state @xmath17 to be coupled to bath states with two photons  the latter may be associated with the same mode or two different modes .      the time evolving state vector is written in the form : @xmath18 and @xmath19 are interaction picture amplitudes for the various states .",
    "a straight - forward substitution into the schrdinger equation leads to a set of coupled equations for these amplitudes .",
    "the overall aim is to find the evolution of the atomic initial state , e.g.  @xmath20 .",
    "we first obtain a set of coupled equations for the laplace transforms of the amplitude equations , and then apply the approach of law00a to make a convenient change of the amplitudes by incorporating the coupling constants via @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "laplace transforms are denoted by a bar , and associated with the complex variable @xmath0 .",
    "the coupled equations obtained are @xcite:@xmath23these involve a frequency independent parameter : @xmath24    it is not possible to obtain explicit solutions for the new laplace transform amplitudes",
    ". however , we can proceed further by first eliminating @xmath25 in the above equations , leading to a set of coupled equations for the remaining amplitudes @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "we then eliminate @xmath28 in favour of @xmath27 ( though not the reverse ) giving a set of equations ( see @xcite ) for the remaining amplitude @xmath27:@xmath29the above equation is for the amplitude @xmath30 it is of course coupled to all similar amplitudes @xmath27 .    by converting the sums to integrals ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath31 , we obtain a fredholm integral equation of the second kind @xcite@xmath32with @xmath33the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 are all functions of the laplace variable @xmath0 . the quantity @xmath36 performs the role of the kernel for the integral equation for the quantity @xmath37 , and the quantity @xmath38 makes the integral equation inhomogeneous .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the integral equations for @xmath39 and the other related equations for @xmath28 and @xmath40 only involve the reservoir quantities @xmath41 in terms of _ reservoir structure functions _",
    "@xmath42    since the atomic density",
    "operator@xmath43also only involves reservoir structure functions and the reduced amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 , an important result follows that the overall dynamics is entirely determined by the reservoir structure functions .",
    "the integral equation ( [ eq . basic int eqn ] ) can be solved in different ways , such as : ( a ) numerical methods in which the integral equation is converted to a matrix equation ( see next sections ) ; ( b ) expansions using bi - orthogonal eigenfunctions ( see ref .",
