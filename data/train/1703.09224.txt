    "the coalescence of gases by turbulence and gravity intricately controls star formation within giant molecular clouds @xcite . on one hand , turbulence has the ability to hinder star formation by providing kinetic energy that can oppose gravity . on the other ,",
    "the supersonic turbulence ubiquitously observed in the molecular phase of the interstellar medium ( ism ) produces local shocks and compressions , which lead to enhanced gas densities that are key for triggering star formation @xcite .",
    "understanding the complex effects of turbulence in the ism is therefore crucial to understanding the process of galaxy evolution .",
    "the cold turbulent gas that provides the fuel for star formation is only visible in the millimetre / sub - millimetre to radio wavelengths , and is often faint , making it difficult to detect at high spatial resolutions .",
    "a standard method to measure the mean column density of molecular gas ( @xmath1 ) is to use rotational lines of co. a severe problem with this method is that , because co is about @xmath8 times less abundant than the main mass carrier , @xmath0 , one requires a co - to-@xmath0 conversion factor , which is typically calibrated based on measurements in our own galaxy .",
    "however , the co - to-@xmath0 conversion factor may depend on metallicity , environment and redshift , introducing high uncertainties in the reconstruction of the total gas surface densities from measurements of co @xcite .",
    "another method is to measure dust emission or dust extinction and assuming a gas - to - dust ratio to infer the molecular gas masses and surface densities .",
    "these methods can suffer from uncertainties in the gas - to - dust ratio , especially for low - metallicity galaxies where this ratio becomes increasingly uncertain .",
    "both co and dust observations require telescopes and instruments that work at millimetre / sub - millimetre wavelengths , which may not always be available and/or may have relatively low spatial resolution . here",
    "we present a new method to estimate @xmath1 based on the star formation rate ( sfr ) , which can be obtained with optical spectroscopy .",
    "large optical integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) surveys have started to provide us with details regarding the chemical distribution and kinematics of extragalactic sources at a size and uniformity unprecedented until recent times .",

    "* ) , and the galaxy and mass assembly survey ( gama ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have contributed more than 3.5 million spectra that have been of extraordinary aid to our understanding of galaxy evolution .",
    "however , those spectra have been taken with a single fibre or slit , and provide only a single , global spectrum per galaxy @xcite .",
    "these spectra are therefore susceptible to aperture effects because differing parts or fractions of the galaxies are recorded for each source , thus making each observation dependent on the size and distance of the galaxy , as well as the positioning of the fibre @xcite .",
    "conversely , ifs can spatially resolve each galaxy observed , thus assigning individual spectra at many locations across the galaxy .",
    "here we utilise data from the sami galaxy survey , an ifs survey with the aim to observe 3400 galaxies over a broad range of environments and stellar masses .",
    "we use the sfrs measured in sami in order to provide a tool for estimating @xmath1 .",
    "the basis of our @xmath1 reconstruction method is a recent star formation relation developed in the multi - freefall framework of turbulent gas @xcite .",

    "however , significant scatter and discrepancies between different sets of data exist within this framework , commonly referred to as the kennicutt - schmidt relation .",
    "these discrepancies suggest that @xmath3 does not only depend on @xmath1 , but also on factors such as the turbulence and the freefall time of the dense gas on small scales .    motivated by the fact that dense gas forms stars at a higher rate , a new star formation correlator was derived in @xcite , hereafter sfk15 .",

    "our new correlator instead uses the concept of a multi - freefall time , which was pioneered by @xcite , tested with numerical simulations in @xcite , and used in sfk15 as a stepping stone to expand upon the kdm12 model .",
    "sfk15 found that @xmath3 is equal to @xmath18 of the mgcr by placing observations of milky way clouds and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) in the k98 , kdm12 and sfk15 frameworks , confirming the measured low efficiency of star formation @xcite .",
    "statistical tests in sfk15 showed that a significantly better correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath12 was achieved than that which could be attained between either the @xmath1 or @xmath17 parameterisations of the previous star formation relations by k98 and kdm12 , respectively .",
    "the scatter in the sfk15 relation was found to be a factor of 34 lower than in the k98 and kdm12 relations , suggesting that it provides a better physical model for @xmath3 compared to the empirical relation by k98 and compared to the single - freefall relation by kdm12 .",

    "the h@xmath2-to - sfr conversion factor used in this work is only valid for star - forming regions , because agn / shock - dominated spaxels are contaminated with emission from agn / shock regions @xcite .",

    "each galaxy was classified as either a ` star - forming ' or ` composite / agn / shock ' galaxy .",

    "( [ eq : newsflaw ] ) , we need an estimate of the turbulent velocity dispersion of the molecular gas in order to construct the turbulent mach number . here",
    "we use the h@xmath2 velocity dispersion to approximate the velocity dispersion of the cold gas .",

    "this is because of the relatively weak dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath4 , as we will derive in sec .",
