    "topologically ordered quantum systems have attracted a tremendous amount of interest in various research fields ( see ref .   for a recent review ) .",
    "in contrast to conventional phases of matter , topologically ordered phases can not be described by a local order parameter but are rather characterized by non local properties such as a topology - dependent ground - state degeneracy.@xcite moreover , elementary excitations in topological phases are particles , called anyons , that obey nontrivial braiding statistics.@xcite although , theoretically , several models are known to be topologically ordered , nonambiguous experimental evidence is still lacking .",
    "obviously , changing the topology of a system and measuring its ground - state degeneracy is not an easy task .",
    "thus , a natural issue that arises is to find a measurable smoking - gun signature of topological order . to our knowledge",
    ", this remains a challenge but one may already wonder what characteristics of a topologically ordered system are experimentally accessible .",
    "so far , most studies have focused on static low - energy properties of the spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , dynamical properties are known to provide much more informations and are of direct relevance for spectroscopy experiments based , for instance , on inelastic neutron scattering . to bridge the gap between theory and possible future experiments , dynamical correlation functions",
    "have very recently been computed in two different topologically ordered systems.@xcite    in this paper , we address similar issues by investigating the toric code@xcite in a magnetic field .",
    "although the toric code is likely the simplest model displaying topological order , the presence of a uniform field gives rise to unusual transitions in the phase diagram .",
    "the latter has been derived by analyzing the ground - state energy as well as the one - quasiparticle ( 1qp ) gap.@xcite computing spin - spin correlation functions is more involved since local spin operators create or annihilate qps by pairs .",
    "therefore , one must go beyond 1qp properties . here , we calculate a typical dynamical correlation function inside the topological phase of the perturbed toric code by means of high - order series expansions in the small - field limit .",
    "we restrict our computation to 2qp physics which contains most of the spectral weight for sufficiently small magnetic fields .",
    "this correlation function displays fascinating features originating from the interplay of the anyon kinetics and interactions . in particular , for certain field ranges , strong interactions induce bosonic 2qp bound states , which are the lowest excitations and dominate the low - energy behavior of the dynamical correlation function .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian of the toric code@xcite in a uniform magnetic field @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the usual pauli matrices on site @xmath2 .",
    "the so - called charge and flux operators are defined as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 refer to stars and plaquettes of a square lattice [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](a ) ] . in the following ,",
    "we consider open boundary conditions ( infinite plane ) and , without loss of generality , we restrict our study to @xmath7 .    for @xmath8 , one has @xmath9=[h , b_p]=0 $ ] so that the ground state obeys @xmath10 .",
    "acting on the ground state with @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) yields an eigenstate of energy @xmath13 with two static excitations existing on the two stars ( plaquettes ) sharing site @xmath2 , called charges ( fluxes ) .",
    "charges and fluxes are hard - core bosons with mutual semionic statistics.@xcite the operator @xmath14 , when acting on @xmath15 , obviously creates both a pair of charges and a pair of fluxes with a total energy @xmath16 . in the presence of a magnetic field , charges and fluxes become dispersive and",
    "excitations can then be described in terms of quasicharges and quasifluxes.@xcite",
    "to probe the spectral and dynamical properties of the system , natural quantities are the space- and time - dependent correlation functions . for simplicity ,",
    "we focus on the function @xmath17 whose fourier transform reads @xmath18 where ( @xmath19 denotes the @xmath20 excited state of @xmath21 with eigenenergy @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 is the number of unit cells .",
    "in addition , we consider only the case where the observable @xmath11 acts on vertical links .",
    "as can be checked , the total spectral weight obeys the following sum rule : @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the first brillouin zone .    for @xmath8 , as explained above",
    ", @xmath26 is an eigenstate of @xmath21 with two ( static ) charges so that @xmath27 .",
    "the situation changes when a magnetic field is switched on since in this case qps interact and become dispersive , so that @xmath28 displays more interesting features .",
    "however , for small fields , most of the spectral weight remains in the 2qp channel near @xmath29 .        as a first step , let us thus discuss the 2qp spectrum that appears explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) . to compute this spectrum",
    ", we use perturbative continuous unitary transformations@xcite which is a well suited method to tackle this problem@xcite as already shown in the study of the 0qp and 1qp spectra.@xcite in a few words , the idea is to consider an effective , unitarily transformed , hamiltonian that is block - diagonal in the canonical eigenbasis of the zero - field hamiltonian . the perturbative continuous unitary transformations technique allows one to compute @xmath30 perturbatively in @xmath31 .",
    "however , in each block with @xmath32-particles , once the matrix elements of @xmath30 are obtained in the canonical basis , one still has to diagonalize a @xmath32-body problem .",
    "this procedure yields the eigenstates @xmath33 of @xmath30 , related to eigenstates of @xmath21 through @xmath34 . in the 2qp sector , this diagonalization is performed numerically for large system sizes ( @xmath35 sites ) and for any value of the total momentum @xmath36 of the two qps .",
    "let us underline that @xmath30 conserves the parity of the number of quasicharges and of quasifluxes ( independently ) , so that the 2qp sector splits into two subsectors corresponding to ( i ) one quasicharge and one quasiflux ; ( ii ) two quasicharges or two quasifluxes . in the present problem ,",
    "we consider only the latter subsector since @xmath37 creates a superposition of states with an even number of quasicharges and of quasifluxes when acting on @xmath38 ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "typical densities of states ( doss ) are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] for @xmath39 .    for @xmath40 ,",
    "the quasicharges become mobile but no binding effect is expected [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](b ) ] .",
    "thus , although quasicharges are hard - core bosons , the 2qp excitation energies are qualitatively given by the sum of the two single quasicharge dispersions and give rise to a continuum at fixed @xmath41 . at order 3 ( see ref .",
    "for higher orders ) , for an arbitrary field , this dispersion reads @xmath42 \\\\ & & + h_z\\,\\alpha(\\boldsymbol{k } ) \\left\\{h_x^2+\\frac{11}{8 } h_y^2 + 2h_z^2 \\big[5 - 2\\alpha(\\boldsymbol{k})^2\\big]\\right\\ } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 , for a single - particle momentum @xmath44 .",
    "details inside the continuum can also be qualitatively understood thanks to the 1qp dispersion .",
    "in particular , the maxima of the doss at fixed @xmath45 can be understood from the saddle points in @xmath46 of these 2qp energies . unlike quasicharges , for @xmath47 , quasifluxes remain static , yielding a flat band at @xmath29 .    for @xmath48 , the situation is different .",
    "indeed , although a single quasicharge ( or quasiflux ) remains static , @xmath49 induces an unusual dynamics of particle pairs ( see ref .   as well as refs .   for closely related issues",
    "the associated dimensional reduction leads to either flat bands or one - dimensional dispersive bands in the 2qp spectrum .",
    "consequently , for a fixed momentum @xmath41 , no continuum is observed and the spectrum is discrete [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : dos](c ) ] . as discussed in ref .",
    ", the corresponding eigenstates are bound states .",
    "when @xmath50 and @xmath51 are finite , the spectrum displays both a quasicharge continuum and some discrete energy levels associated to the aforementioned bound states [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](d ) ]",
    ". interestingly , one needs a finite value of @xmath51 to observe bound states out of the continuum . if @xmath51 is large enough , such bound states can even exist for any value of the momentum @xmath41 and become the lowest energy 2qp states ( see discussion below ) .",
    "finally , note that for @xmath39 , the quasiflux continuum also exists but its width is of order @xmath52 ( whereas the width of the quasicharge continuum is of order @xmath50 ) .",
    "this quasiflux continuum thus looks like a flat band .    the next step to obtain @xmath53 is to compute @xmath54 as motivated above , for sufficiently small fields , the most relevant matrix elements are those involving 2qp states .",
    "more precisely , the contribution of the 2qp sector to the total spectral weight @xmath55 can be computed perturbatively . at order 4",
    ", it reads @xmath56 for all values of the field considered here , most of the spectral weight lies in the 2qp sector since @xmath57 . as a consequence , we restrict the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) to 2qp states and neglect higher - energy sectors .",
    "typical plots of @xmath58 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s8 ] where , as for the doss , we used a finite broadening @xmath59 . in practice , we computed the 2qp spectrum ( and thus the energy resolution ) at order 6 while matrix elements of @xmath37 [ and thus @xmath58 ] at order 4 ( see the appendix ) .",
    "let us start by discussing the case . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : s8 ] ( upper panel ) , @xmath58 is almost independent of @xmath61 but strongly varies with @xmath50 . to understand this feature",
    ", it is worth considering the lowest non - trivial orders .",
    "indeed , ( i ) at order 0 , the effective observable @xmath62 creates two quasicharges when acting on the ground state ; ( ii ) at order 1 , the effective hamiltonian does not couple quasicharges and quasifluxes that behave as hard - core bosons with nearest - neighbor hoppings .",
    "higher orders lead to several minor modifications of this picture . on the one hand , in the two quasicharges sector ,",
    "@xmath63 is modified from order 2 only . on the other hand",
    ", the two quasifluxes sector remains almost irrelevant .",
    "indeed , although @xmath30 couples quasicharges and quasifluxes from order 2 , @xmath37 starts to create quasifluxes at order 3 only , hence yielding corrections to @xmath63 .",
    "the main features of @xmath58 are obviously related to those of the dos [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) ] .",
    "in particular , at fixed @xmath45 , the extrema of both quantities are observed at the same energies [ see for instance figs .",
    "[ fig : dos](b ) and [ fig : s8](a ) ] .",
    "however , the flat band at @xmath29 due to quasifluxes observed in the dos is absent in @xmath58 .",
    "let us also stress that the flat band at @xmath29 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : s8](e ) does not originate from quasifluxes but from quasicharges that are static for @xmath64 .        drastic changes in @xmath53 arise when @xmath65 for two reasons : ( i ) at order 1 , quasicharges and quasifluxes interact , giving rise to the previously discussed bound states ; ( ii ) the effective observable generates quasifluxes at the same order .",
    "for sufficiently large @xmath51 , an important part of the spectral weight is carried by some of these bound states [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : s8 ] ( lower panel ) ] .",
    "in contrast to the dos , @xmath53 clearly detects these states and keeps track of them when they merge into the continuum , leaving prominent resonances . note also that the dos is symmetric under the exchange @xmath66 ( for any @xmath51 ) but @xmath53 is not due to the choice of the observable @xmath67 .",
    "let us next comment on the continua boundaries observed in @xmath53 .",
    "for @xmath65 , these are clearly defined either by the quasicharge dispersion when @xmath68 [ see the dashed ( red ) lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : s8](g ) ] or by the quasiflux dispersion in the opposite case [ see the dotted ( green ) lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : s8](i ) ] .",
    "the case @xmath69 needs to be treated more carefully . in the extreme case @xmath64",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ fig : s8](e ) ] , the previously discussed flat band at @xmath29 contains all the spectral weight . indeed , with @xmath70 as the only perturbation",
    ", it is not possible to transmute ( virtually ) two charges into two fluxes . when @xmath71 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : s8](d ) ] , the boundaries of the continuum are actually given by the quasiflux dispersion even if this is not visible with the intensity scale used in the plots . the leading contribution to @xmath63 between the dashed ( red ) and dotted ( green ) lines is of order @xmath72 , whereas for @xmath65 it is of order @xmath73 .    finally ,",
    "if @xmath51 becomes much larger than @xmath61 and @xmath50 ( while remaining in the topological phase ) , the 2qp extremal - energy states are bound states for any value of the total momentum , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] .",
    "the lowest - energy excitation is therefore a two - particle bound state at @xmath74 .",
    "a simple way to understand this phenomenon is to consider the limit @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , in this case , the spectrum displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](c ) is made only of bound states.@xcite the lowest 2qp - energy level is two - fold degenerate whereas , at any finite order , the central band is infinitely degenerate .",
    "switching on @xmath61 and @xmath50 induces two different effects .",
    "first , the central band degeneracy is lifted and gives rise to the continuum .",
    "second , the lowest flat band splits into two dispersive bands as clearly observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] .",
    "when @xmath61 and @xmath50 are further increased , the bound state eventually merges into the continuum which broadens .",
    "to date , most studies of topological phases have focused on low - energy properties ( the ground state and first excited states ) . in the present work",
    ", we went one step beyond by computing a typical zero - temperature dynamical correlation function in one of the simplest topologically ordered systems , namely , the toric code , in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this challenging problem requires dealing with high - energy states , but is crucial for potential future experiments . using a perturbative approach and a controlled ( 2qp ) approximation , we have unveiled the importance of bound states of anyons that , depending on the magnetic field , can carry most of the spectral weight .",
    "the role of these bound states in the breakdown of the topological phase is an interesting question that is still to be elucidated .",
    "recently , dynamical correlation functions have been computed@xcite in kitaev s honeycomb model which is deeply related to the toric code in some limiting cases.@xcite a very interesting question would be to analyze the influence of a magnetic field in this system to determine whether bound states also arise in the high - energy spectrum , especially since ultracold atom experiments may have a chance to simulate this model.@xcite finally , studying the effect of temperature on these correlation functions is undoubtedly the next step in the understanding of topological phases of matter , and we hope that the present work will stimulate further investigations in this direction .",

    "in this appendix , we give 2qp matrix elements of @xmath76 in the two - quasicharge or two - quasiflux subsector , up to order 2 ( series up to order 6 are available upon request ) .",
