    "since its introduction in 1995  @xcite , nrqcd has become the standard framework to study heavy - quarkonium physics .",
    "nrqcd is a non - relativistic effective theory equivalent to qcd , where inclusive cross sections and decay rates can be factorised as the product of short - distance and long - distance parts .",
    "the short - distance coefficients are process - dependent but can be computed in perturbative qcd , the strong coupling constant @xmath2 being the parameter of the expansion .",
    "the long - distance matrix elements are process - independent , _",
    "i.e. _ , universal , but non - perturbative .",
    "they can be classified in terms of their scaling in @xmath3 , the relative velocity of the heavy quarks in the bound state , and as a result , physical quantities can be expressed as a double series in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "an innovation of this formalism is the colour - octet mechanism : the heavy - quark pair is allowed to be created in a colour - octet state over short distances , the color being neutralised over long distances .",
    "it is thanks to this very mechanism that it is possible to account for the cdf data  @xcite on the inclusive @xmath0 and @xmath4 cross sections at the tevatron  @xcite . in this case",
    "the colour - octet matrix elements fitted from the data roughly scale as the power counting rules of nrqcd predict . on the other hand",
    ", the recent data collected at @xmath5 tev by the cdf collaboration  @xcite have revealed that the @xmath0 is unpolarised , in flagrant disagreement with the expectations of nrqcd .",
    "it is fair to say that the mechanisms responsible for the quarkonium production at the tevatron are not completely understood yet ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) .",
    "another challenge to theorists has been provided by the recent measurements at @xmath6 factories , where rates for inclusive and exclusive @xmath0 production in association with a @xmath7 quark pair  @xcite are far larger than the leading order nrqcd theoretical expectations  @xcite . in this case , keeping only the leading term in @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the nrqcd expansion results in a very rough approximation .",
    "in addition , as opposed to the production of the @xmath0 in hadron collisions , colour - octet channels can not be invoked to bring theoretical predictions in agreement with the experimental measurement  @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath8 ( nlo ) corrections to this process has been recently found to reduce the discrepancy between theory and measurements  @xcite .    in view of the unexpectedly large measurements for the production of @xmath0 associated with a @xmath7 quark pair in @xmath9 annihilation ,",
    "it is natural to wonder whether the corresponding production pattern could be large in hadroproduction as well .",
    "besides offering a new interesting signature , such as @xmath10 in association with one or two heavy quark tags , this process contributes to the @xmath11 ( nlo ) corrections to the inclusive colour - singlet hadroproduction of @xmath12 and @xmath1 .",
    "historically , these higher - order contributions to the cross section at the tevatron were considered in the fragmentation approximation as a first attempt to solve the so - called @xmath4 anomaly  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present and discuss the complete tree - level calculation for the associated production of @xmath12 and @xmath1 ( commonly noted @xmath13 ) with a heavy - quark pair of the same flavour .",
    "such associated production has been recently discussed in the @xmath14 factorisation formalism  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the leading order term in the nrqcd expansion in the usual collinear factorisation scheme .",
    "+    this letter is organised as follows . in section [ sec : lo_ggtoqqq ] , we briefly decribe the method used to compute the associated hadroproduction of a quarkonium with a heavy - quark pair together with the results for the tevatron and the lhc . in section",
    "[ sec : frag ] , we discuss the validity of the fragmentation approximation @xmath15 at the tevatron . in section [ sec : polarisation ] we discuss the polarisation of the quarkonium produced by colour - singlet transitions .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the discussion of our results .",
    "in this section , we present the numerical method used to compute quarkonium production amplitudes . at leading order in @xmath3 , the invariant amplitude to create a @xmath17 quarkonium @xmath18 of momentum @xmath19 and polarisation @xmath20 can be expressed as the product of the amplitude to create the corresponding heavy - quark pair , a spin projector @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , the radial wave function at the origin in the configuration space corrections , the relation to the nrqcd production matrix element is given by @xmath23 , where the normalisation of ref .",
    "@xcite is assumed .",
    "] , namely ,  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the quark spin , @xmath28 the antiquark one and @xmath29 is the projector onto a color - singlet state . in the non - relativistic limit , the spin projector factor can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the polarisation vector of the quarkonium .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath32 involves 42 feynman diagrams and an analytical computation is not practical . we have therefore opted for using a custom version of madgraph  @xcite , to generate the amplitudes and perform the spin projection numerically . the expression in  eq .",
    "( [ pojectionfac ] ) can be evaluated with the help of the helas subroutines  @xcite , as done in ref .",
    "we validated our algorithm to generate the amplitudes for quarkonium production and decays by comparing with several known analytical results point - by - point in phase space .",
    "finally , we use the techniques introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to perform the phase - space integration . as an exercise",
    ", we have reproduced the cross section and the @xmath33 distribution for @xmath34 production at the tevatron and found agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .    at hadron",
    "colliders a @xmath17 quarkonium state is observed through its decay into leptons . in order to keep the spin correlations between the vector - like bound state and the leptons , we can replace @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ pojectionfac ] ) by the leptonic current @xmath35 the polarisation of the quarkonium can therefore be determined by analysing the angular distribution of the leptons . defining @xmath36 as the angle between the @xmath37 direction in the quarkonium rest frame and the quarkonium direction in the laboratory frame ,",
    "the normalised angular distribution @xmath38 is @xmath39 where the relation between @xmath40 and the polarisation state of the quarkonium is @xmath41      as for the case of open charm and bottom cross sections , heavy - quarkonium hadroproduction is dominated by gluon fusion .",
    "we have checked that the light - quark initiated process for @xmath42 production is suppressed by three orders of magnitude , and thus this contribution is neglected in the following .    in our numerical studies",
    "we have used :    * @xmath43 gev@xmath44 and @xmath45 gev@xmath44 ; * @xmath46 ; * br@xmath47 and br@xmath48 * @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 gev ; * pdf set : cteq6 m  @xcite .    in fig.2",
    "we show the @xmath33 distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the tevatron and the lhc , for both @xmath51 and @xmath52 production .",
    "the theoretical error bands in the @xmath52 curves correspond to the uncertainties from the renormalisation and factorisation scale ( @xmath53 ) and the heavy - quark masses ( @xmath54 gev or @xmath55 gev ) , combined in quadrature .",
    "we start by considering @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at the tevatron , where a rapidity cut @xmath56 is applied . for the charmonium case , we note that the @xmath33 distribution peaks at @xmath57 and then it starts a quick descrease , dropping by four orders of magnitude at @xmath58 gev .",
    "in fact , at moderate transverse momentum , @xmath59 , @xmath52 production has much milder slope compared to that of @xmath51 . even though suppressed by @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath52 production starts to be comparable to @xmath51 already for @xmath60 .",
    "we verified that the topologies where the @xmath13 is produced by two different quark lines always dominate .",
    "this feature is to be related with the @xmath0 production at @xmath9 colliders , where the presence of two extra charmed mesons seems to indicate that the @xmath0 is mostly often created from two different quark lines as well . for the @xmath1 ,",
    "the curve is less steep in the same @xmath33 range due to the larger value of the @xmath61-quark mass .",
    "the results for the lhc are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:3s1qq ] ( c , d ) .",
    "a cut @xmath62 has been applied . since the rapidity distribution is flat in this range , this is equivalent to consider the quarkonium production at zero rapidity .",
    "the @xmath33 behaviours for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are very similar to those at the tevatron while the normalisation is increased by one order of magnitude .",
    "in this section we discuss the range of applicability of the fragmentation approximation for the process where a @xmath63 pair is produced at high @xmath33 and one of the heavy quarks fragments into a quarkonium state , @xmath64 . at sufficiently large @xmath33",
    ", it is expected that the quark - fragmentation contributions would dominate the @xmath65 cross section .      in the fragmentation approximation ,",
    "the cross section for the production of a quarkonium @xmath13 by gluon fusion via a heavy quark @xmath66 fragmentation is given , at all orders in @xmath2 , by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the differential cross section to produce an _ on - shell _ heavy quark @xmath66 with momentum @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the fragmentation function of @xmath66 into a quarkonium @xmath18 .",
    "the fragmentation scale , @xmath71 , is usually chosen to avoid large logarithms of @xmath72 in @xmath73 , that is @xmath74 .",
    "the summation of the corresponding large logarithms of @xmath75 appearing in the fragmentation function can be obtained via an evolution equation  @xcite .",
    "the perturbative quark fragmentation function into quarkonium @xmath76 via a @xmath77}$ ] state at the scale @xmath78 is  @xcite @xmath79      we now compare the results of the full lo cross sections for @xmath80 with those calculated in the fragmentation approximation .",
    "the same set of parameters of section  [ sec : results ] is employed . note",
    "that this choice , as well as the use of cteq6 m , leads to smaller cross sections compared those of ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : comp ] . the approximation is lower than the full computation in the @xmath33 range accessible at the tevatron .",
    "we have verified that for @xmath0 production , the two curves still differ by a little bit less than @xmath81% at @xmath82 gev . for the @xmath1 , much larger values of @xmath33",
    "are required ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ( b ) ) .",
    "therefore , contrary to the common wisdom , in the kinematical region accessible at the tevatron , @xmath83 , which is an nlo subset of @xmath84 , is not dominated by the fragmentation contributions .",
    "let us first review the analytical result for @xmath86 , which we used as a check of our numerical procedure . to compute the polarisation parameter @xmath40 discussed in section [ sec : method ] , it is sufficient to consider the unpolarised ( or total ) cross section and the longitudinal one in the laboratory frame .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 introduced in section [ sec : method ] can then be written as @xmath87    the total cross section is calculated from the squared amplitude summed over the quarkonium polarisation which reads  @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the usual mandelstam variables for parton quantities . to compute the squared amplitude for longitudinally polarised quarkonia",
    ", we need to define the longitudinal polarisation vector in the laboratory frame : @xmath93 with @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the usual momentum fractions of the incoming gluons . from that definition and the eqs .",
    "( 10.505 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can then easily compute @xmath97 if @xmath95 and @xmath96 are approximately equal and the masses can be neglected , it is possible to see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : m2tot ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : m2l ] ) that the quarkonia will be transversally polarised . using the same parameters as for the previous plots , we find that @xmath40 gets rapidly close to one for @xmath98 , see fig .  [ fig : pol - gg3s1 g ] .",
    "our results agree with those of ref .",
    "@xcite .    note that this behaviour of @xmath40 is not expected to be seen in the data , since the yield from @xmath99 is not dominant , even when only colour - singlet channels are considered . for the process @xmath100",
    ", @xmath40 remains close to zero in the whole @xmath33 range . since the latter is the one which dominates over the other colour - singlet contributions , we conclude that the quarkonia not produced by a colour - octet mechanism will be unpolarised at high @xmath33 .",
    "in this letter , we have presented the tree - level calculation for the associated production of @xmath12 and @xmath1 with a heavy - quark pair .",
    "the motivation was twofold .",
    "first , these processes offer a new interesting signature , that could be tested experimentally by measuring the fraction of quarkonium produced with at least one heavy - light quark meson .",
    "second , they contribute to the @xmath11 ( nlo ) corrections to the inclusive colour - singlet hadroproduction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    we have found that the quark - fragmentation approximation employed to describe quarkonium production should not be applied in the range of transverse momenta reached at the tevatron and analysed by the cdf collaboration .",
    "the fragmentation approximation actually underestimates the full contribution of @xmath101 by more than a factor four in the region @xmath102 gev .",
    "this approximation starts to be justified ( within @xmath103 of error ) only for @xmath104 gev .",
    "the same conclusion applies for the @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath105 the fragmentation approximation is relevant at even higher @xmath33 , as expected .",
    "it is interesting to note that for @xmath0 production from @xmath9 annihilation , the fragmentation approximation is only @xmath106 away from the full contribution at @xmath107 gev @xcite .",
    "one may try to gather an intuitive explanation for such glaring difference by considering the feynman diagrams contributing to the two processes . in @xmath9 annihilation",
    ", there are only four diagrams at leading order , two of which contribute to the fragmentation topologies . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamics underlying the @xmath17-quarkonia production at the tevatron is much more involved .",
    "the number of feynman diagrams is significantly larger ( 42 vs. 4 ) and only a few of them give rise to fragmentation topologies . as a result ,",
    "the fragmentation approximation starts to be relevant at a much higher regime in @xmath33 .",
    "a similar situation holds for the process @xmath108",
    "@xcite and also for the @xmath34 hadroproduction , where the fragmentation approximation is not accurate in the @xmath33 range explored at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the @xmath0 or @xmath1 produced in association with a heavy - quark pair of the same flavour are _",
    "unpolarised_. further analysis , including combination with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath109 at nlo and ref .",
    "@xcite , to compare with the available data from the tevatron , is ongoing .    in conclusion , we look forward to the measurement of the fraction of events in the @xmath0 sample at the tevatron , with at least one charmed meson in the final state .",
    "such a measurement could also provide further insight to the mechanism responsible for inclusive heavy - quarkonium production at hadron colliders .",
