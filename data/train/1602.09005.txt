    "as referred to above , the two survey projects that identified ccs in the smc are ogleiii @xcite and eros2 @xcite .",

    ", we decided to use only ogleiii data in the area covered by this survey , and to consider only the @xmath18 eros2 cc candidates in the ( small ) area covered by this survey but not by ogleiii . after removing from this small sample those objects that were found to lie very far from the ogleiii @xmath6",
    ", we ended up with 13 bona fide cc candidates in the eros2-only field .    in this paper",
    "we present results for the ccs included in 11 tiles ( each tile is 1.5 deg@xmath19 on the sky ) completely or nearly completely observed , processed , and catalogued by the vmc survey as of 2015 march 9 ( including observations obtained until 2014 september ) , namely the tiles smc 3_3 , 3_5 , 4_2 , 4_3 , 4_4 , 4_5 , 5_2 , 5_3 , 5_4 , 6_3 , and 6_5 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the spatial extent of the vmc tiles across the smc body .",
    "the completed tiles do not cover the entire area surveyed by ogleiii .",
    "however , given the high concentration of ccs in the central body of the smc , the number of pulsators included in the completed vmc tiles is about 90% of the total ogleiii sample .",
    "table  [ ncep1 ] lists the coordinates of the quoted tiles , as well as the number of ccs included in each tile .    in total",
    ", we were able to study 4159 objects of the 4630 ogleiii sample .",
    "to this number we have to add the 13 ccs from the eros2 data , leaving us with a final sample of 4172 ccs . the classification of the investigated pulsators in terms of fundamental ( f ) , first overtone ( fo ) , second overtone ( so ) , and mixed modes ( f / fo , fo / so , f / fo / so , fo / so / to , where to stands for third overtone ) is shown in table  [ ncep2 ] .    a general description of the observing strategy of the vmc survey can be found in @xcite .",
    "the procedures adopted to study the variable stars were discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "however , it is worth recalling that the vmc @xmath1-band time - series observations were scheduled to span 13 separate epochs distributed over several consecutive months",
    ". this observing strategy permits one to achieve well - sampled light curves for different types of variable stars , including rr lyrae variables and cepheids of all types . as for the @xmath8 and @xmath14 bands ,",
    "the nominal number of epochs is four ( two of these epochs are obtained with half exposure time ) and may be acquired during the same night given that monitoring in these filters was not planned .",
    "however , a few additional epochs are usually available for each tile ( especially in the @xmath1-band ) , because some observing blocks ( obs ) were executed outside of our specifications ( typically for seeing values exceeding 0.81.0 arcsec ) , but the data were still useful since the ccs are relatively bright .",
    "in addition , there is a small overlap between the tiles .",
    "consequently , the ccs present in multiple tiles possess at least twice the scheduled number of epochs .",
    "given the high concentration of ccs in the contiguous tiles smc 4_3 , 4_4 , 5_3 , and 5_4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , we have more than 320 ccs whose light curves contain more than @xmath2028 phase points .",
    "this is also shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the bimodal distribution of epochs in the @xmath1 band is clear . from the figure , note that there are a few dozen stars with fewer than 13 epochs in @xmath1 .",
    "this can happen when the sources are located in underexposed areas and/or are affected by bright neighbours or bad pixels .",
    "we were still able to analyze these stars thanks to our template - fitting procedure ( see section  [ template ] ) .",
    "the same considerations hold for the @xmath8 and @xmath14 bands , whose epoch distributions are shown in the top and middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , respectively . in this case , the number of ccs with more than 10 epochs is 213 and 321 in the @xmath8 and @xmath14 bands , respectively .",
    "similarly , the number of ccs with more than five epochs is 2121 and 2343 in @xmath8 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the vmc data were processed with the pipeline @xcite of the vista data flow system ( vdfs , * ? ? ? * ) and the photometry is in the vista photometric system ( vegamag=0 ) .",
    "the time - series data analyzed in this work were downloaded from the vista science archive ( vsa , * ? ? ?",
    "details about the data reduction can be found in the aforementioned papers .",
    "however , we briefly recall that ( i ) the pipeline applies a correction to the photometry of stars close to the saturation limit @xcite .",
    "this task is very useful , because long - period ccs are very bright ( @xmath2113 ) mag .",
    "the time - series photometry of these variables takes advantage of the vdfs capability to deal with the images for saturation , although the corrections applied do not always guarantee a full recovery of the data .",
    "( ii ) the vsa processing produces quality flags for each star that are valuable to understand if the images have problems .",
    "this information is important for the following analysis .    to obtain the @xmath8 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 light curves , the ogleiii ( and eros2 )",
    "catalog(s ) of ccs described above were cross - correlated against the vmc catalog , taking all counterparts from the ogleiii and eros2 positions , regardless of their separation on the sky .",
    "about 95% of the objects have positions in agreement with those measured by ogleiii and eros2 within less than 0.1@xmath22 . among the remaining 186 stars ,",
    "67 have a separation larger than 0.5@xmath22 and are likely misidentifications .",
    "we will come back to these objects below .",
    "the typical quality of the light curves obtained is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for two f pulsators with very different periods .",
    "vmc photometry for the 4172 stars analysed in this work is reported in table  [ vmcphot ] .",
    "the complete version of the table is available online at the journal site .",
    "given the large number of light curves to analyze , it was convenient to find an automatic way to process the data .",
    "our aim is to obtain an analytical or empirical model light curve that fits the observed one .",
    "this model can subsequently be used to measure the mean magnitude and the peak - to - peak amplitude for each variable . the usual way to carry out such a task is to use truncated fourier series , adding as many harmonics as needed to obtain a good fit to the data @xcite . however",
    ", this kind of approach would not be useful in our case , because the presence of significant gaps in the light curve would lead to strong and unrealistic oscillations in the fourier series .",
    "hence , we decided to use template light curves to fit the data .",
    "following the pioneering work by @xcite , templates to fit cc light curves based on only a few epochs in the nir bands have already been presented and used by @xcite .",
    "the typical approach in these studies consists of the following steps : ( 1 ) adopting templates constructed based on well - sampled cc @xmath14,@xmath23 , and @xmath1 light curves ( galactic or mc objects ) ; ( 2 ) scaling the template amplitude using fixed amplitude ratios ( e.g. , a(@xmath14)/a(@xmath3 ) , with some dependence on period ) ; ( 3 ) adopting literature period and epoch of maximum light to phase - match the template and the observed data .",
    "this technique is valuable , since it allows one to obtain an estimate of the average magnitude of a cc based on just one or two observed phase points . at the same time , given the uncertainties on the amplitude ratios and on the ephemerides , these estimates can easily be affected by errors as large as 5% ( see also sect .",
    "3.3 ) , despite the quite low amplitudes of the light curves in the nir bands .",
    "our approach is fundamentally different from that outlined above ( e.g. , by * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the availability of an average of @xmath20 5.7 , 6.3 , and 16.7 phase points in @xmath8 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 , respectively , allows us to safely rescale our templates in amplitude and phase match them using our observations directly .",
    "this procedure eliminates most of the uncertainties of the `` classical '' template method , because _ we do not have to rely on any fixed amplitude ratio to scale the templates in amplitude , nor do we have to use the literature epoch of maximum as reference to phase match the template and the observed data_.      the first step of our procedure was the construction of the templates . to this end",
    ", we visually inspected a large number of light curves , trying to select those with the most often recurring shapes , and at the same time , those exhibiting precise light curves .",
    "particular care was devoted to covering a broad range of periods .",
    "this search was rather simple in @xmath1 , since in this band we have dozens of well - sampled and precise light curves for any period .",
    "however , we had fewer choices in @xmath8 and @xmath14 , given the much smaller number of well - sampled light curves in those filters .",
    "at the end of this process , we concluded that a set of eight different templates for each band could reproduce the variety of shapes exhibited by the observed light curves .",
    "our templates were constructed as truncated fourier series of the form @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the magnitude , @xmath26 are the phases of the template light curves , @xmath27 is the zero point , which is zero by definition , @xmath28 is the number of terms of the series , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the amplitudes and phases of each term of the series , respectively .",
    "the first step consisted of fitting the selected observed light curves with splines in order to have smooth , densely sampled curves to be passed to the fourier - series fitting program .",
    "this was needed to avoid spurious oscillations in the fourier - series fit due to possible small gaps or undersampling at maximum / minimum of the light curves .",
    "this way , we actually constructed six of the eight different templates adopted for each filter .",
    "they are listed in table  [ paramfourier ] , from t3 to t8 . as for the two remaining templates ,",
    "t1 simply consists of a pure cosine function for all filters ( which is why the t1 template is not included in the table ) , while t2 reproduces a smooth curve which can often be observed in all of the @xmath31 , and @xmath1 bands for a broad range of periods ( see t2 in table  [ paramfourier ] ) .",
    "the shapes of the eight templates in all three filters are shown in fig .",
    "[ alltemplate ] .",
    "the template - fitting procedure includes the following steps :    * scaling the templates with amplitude ratios , e.g. , a(@xmath1)/a(@xmath32 ) , where we take a(@xmath32 ) from the ogleiii survey and the coefficients of these ratios from @xcite .",
    "similarly , the template is phase - matched with the observations using the ephemerides from ogleiii .",
    "the purpose of this step is _ only _ to provide a first - guess average magnitude for the target star and , in turn , to remove the most obvious outliers . in practice",
    ", we simply estimate the template values at the phases of the observed point and calculate the average difference between observed and calculated values , which is the approximate mean magnitude of the star . * recalculating the template by varying its initial phase to find the phase shift that minimizes ( by means of a least - squares fit ) the difference data  template .",
    "this step provides an improved average magnitude ( of the order of a few hundredths of mag ) . *",
    "recalculating the template by varying its amplitude to find the amplitude scaling that minimizes ( by means of a least - squares fit ) the difference data  template .",
    "this step provides a further improvement of the average magnitude ( again , a few hundredths of mag ) . *",
    "fine - tuning outlier removal ( at 2@xmath33 and 3@xmath33 levels in @xmath1 and in @xmath31 , respectively ; the difference is because in @xmath34 we have many fewer phase points than in @xmath1 and , hence , we can simply remove obvious outliers ) and final average - magnitude calculation ( in intensity ) .",
    "this procedure is applied to each template ( in each band ) .",
    "next , we need a tool to choose the template that optimally represents the data . after several trials and visual inspections of the resulting fits , we devised two main useful diagnostics .",
    "the first is the usual @xmath35 minimization , defined as @xmath36 where @xmath28 is the total number of phase points , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the magnitudes of the observed and computed light curves , respectively , and @xmath39 is the magnitude uncertainty per phase point .    the second criterion was devised empirically to take into account the fact that the smallest residuals can result from application of the wrong template simply because the outlier - removal process is too aggressive .",
    "thus , we designed a _ goodness _ ( or _ g _ ) parameter , defined as @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the r.m.s .",
    "of the fit and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the numbers of phase points used in the fit and the total number of phase points , respectively . by definition ,",
    "the first factor of @xmath43 tends to favor templates that give the smallest r.m.s .",
    "values , while the second factor favors those that remove the lowest number of outliers . the balance of these two features yields , in general , an automatic decision about the best templates that is in agreement with visual inspection of the fitting procedure . the value of @xmath43 can be used not only to choose the best template , but also as a more general indicator of the quality of the data and of the relative fitting procedure .",
    "indeed , in general high values of @xmath43 ( in our case , typically @xmath44 ) mean good data ( and good fits ) , while lower values usually indicate significant scatter in the light curves .",
    "extremely high values of @xmath43 ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) are also rather suspect because non - variable stars , exhibiting completely flat light curves ( which happens , for example , when non - variable stars are considered owing to a coordinate missmatch with ogleiii cepheid data ) are expected to yield extremely high values of @xmath43 .",
    "not surprisingly , the @xmath43 parameter is anti - correlated with the corresponding @xmath35 value : the higher @xmath43 is , the lower the @xmath35 becomes .",
    "an example of our template - fitting procedure can be found in fig .",
    "[ template ] ( note that in this case the best template is t4 ) , while the anti - correlation between @xmath43 and @xmath35 is shown in fig .",
    "[ logg ] .      as an additional check of the reliability of the template - fitting procedure , and to estimate in a more quantitative way the precision achieved , we decided to use extensive monte carlo simulations . in practice , for each star ( and for each filter ) , 100 different mock time series were created on the basis of the observed data , to which gaussian noise was added with @xmath33 s corresponding to the average uncertainty on the phase points for the star of interest ( different @xmath33 s were calculated for different filters ) .",
    "the template - fitting procedure outlined above was hence repeated 100 times and the average magnitude and r.m.s .",
    "were calculated .",
    "we then compared these quantities with those calculated from the observed data .",
    "the results of this exercise are summarized in figs  [ figmc_y ] , [ figmc_j ] , and [ figmc_k ] .",
    "the top left - hand panels in each figure show the difference between the magnitude obtained with the best - fitting template ( @xmath46 ) applied to the actual data and that resulting from averaging over the 100 mock light curves ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "similarly , the bottom left - hand panels show the r.m.s . of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath49 .",
    "these figures testify to the high precision reached in the @xmath1 band , where 84% and 99% of the stars have errors on the intensity - averaged magnitudes of @xmath50 mag and @xmath51 mag respectively .",
    "only 1% and 0.1% of the ccs analyzed here have uncertainties @xmath52 mag and @xmath53 mag , respectively . the results are less favorable in the @xmath14 band and even worse in @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , in these bands the corresponding percentages drop to ( 68% , 93% , 7% , and 0.8% ) and ( 56% , 78% , 22% , and 5.5% ) in the @xmath14 and @xmath8 bands , respectively .",
    "the worse results in @xmath8 are mainly due to the fact that ( a ) the peak - to - peak amplitude in this filter is significantly larger than that in the @xmath14 band ( consequently , it is more difficult to estimate the average magnitudes from undersampled light curves ) and ( b ) we have , on average , fewer phase points in @xmath8 than in @xmath14 ( @xmath205.6 versus @xmath206.3 ) .    the top and bottom right - hand panels in figs  [ figmc_y ] , [ figmc_j ] , and [ figmc_k ] display essentially the same results as the panels on the left , but for the peak - to - peak amplitudes instead of the intensity - averaged magnitudes .",
    "again , the results for the amplitudes in the @xmath1 band are very good , while the uncertainties become significantly larger for the @xmath14 and , especially , the @xmath8 filters .    on the basis of the monte carlo experiments",
    ", we decided to assign as uncertainties to the intensity - averaged magnitudes and peak - to - peak amplitudes the values shown in the bottom panels of figs  [ figmc_y ] , [ figmc_j ] , and [ figmc_k ] .",

    "these figures display the data for a subsample of 27 ccs ; figures including the full data set of 4172 objects are available in the electronic version of this paper on the journal s website .",
    "similarly , table  [ tabresults ] reports the main physical quantities derived on the basis of the fitting procedure , namely the intensity - averaged magnitude for each variable ( and each filter ) , the peak - to - peak amplitudes , and the relative errors calculated by means of the monte carlo experiments .    finally , we recall that the @xmath8 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 photometry described in this work is defined in the vista system .",

    "we can not perform a direct comparison with @xcite s results , because they only provide the ratio of nir bands with respect to the @xmath3 band .",
    "however , we can compare the trends versus the periods , since they have different data sets for galactic+lmc and smc ccs .",

    "the data reported in table  [ tabresults ] allow us to derive several useful relationships , adopting various combinations of magnitudes and colors .",

    "the coefficients of the @xmath6 relations were calculated in a similar fashion .    to derive the relevant relationships for f , fo , and so variables , we adopted equations of the form @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 for the @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 relations , respectively .",
    "here , @xmath92 and @xmath93 represent two different magnitudes from among @xmath3 , @xmath8 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 .",
    "the details about the combinations of magnitudes and colors adopted in this papers can be found in table  [ pl ] . in order to use the full sample of pulsators , including the double- or multi - mode ccs",
    ", we decided to use them with the period of the dominant mode ( e.g. , f - mode if the star is an f / fo double - mode pulsator , and so on ) .",
    "this procedure is safe , since from our previous investigation of lmc pulsators @xcite we know that these objects do not exhibit systematic luminosity differences with respect to single - mode objects .",
    "the next step involved checking for the presence of changes in the slope of the different relationships , as found in previous studies in the literature ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "to this aim , we used the @xmath6 in @xmath94 which was known from our previous investigation of the lmc ccs , to show a small intrinsic dispersion ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and which is thus particularly appropriate for our purpose . as a result",
    ", we found that there is a clear change in slope at @xmath95 ( @xmath20 2.95 d ) for f - mode pulsators , while there is no significant change in slope for fo variables .",
    "this was confirmed by the analysis of the @xmath4 and @xmath6 in different filters and is in agreement with the results obtained in the optical ( @xmath96 bands ) for the ogleiii sample of f - mode pulsators by @xcite ( see also references in this paper ) .",
    "however , we do not find the break at @xmath97 ( @xmath20 1.07 d ) that they noticed for fo - mode pulsators .",
    "a possible explanation for the break detected at @xmath983 d is that for shorter periods the blue loop of the cepheid evolutionary track is too short and enters only the reddest part of the instability strip ( m. marconi et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "the @xmath9 was also used to analyze problematic objects , identified as clear outliers from these relations . in total",
    ", we discarded 223 ccs .",
    "we identified different ( but often concurrent ) reasons for the erratic behavior of these objects ( see the final column in table  [ tabresults ] for details ) : ( i ) misidentification : all objects with separation vmc  ogle iii @xmath99 0.2@xmath22 were visually inspected and rejected if they were found to be overluminous in the @xmath9 relation ( more than 100 objects were rejected as such ) ; ( ii ) scattered or heavily undersampled light curves ( always low @xmath43/high @xmath35 values ; more than 50 such objects were present ) ; ( iii ) notes from either ogleiii or vmc , i.e. , the presence of flags reporting problems with the images ( more than 20 rejections ) ; ( iv ) saturation ( seven objects ) . note also that 17 objects with good vmc photometry were rejected because they lacked ogleiii @xmath3-band photometry .",
    "not all outliers can be explained by invoking these reasons ; in fact , there are 35 outliers for which we could find no apparent flaws .",
    "however , most are faint and all are overluminous .",
    "hence , it is likely that they suffer from blending with bright neighbor stars .",
    "the discarded stars are reported separately , both in table  [ tabresults ] and figs  [ figy_pag119 ] ,  [ figj_pag119 ] , and  [ figk_pag119 ] .",
    "finally , we note that a few other objects were excluded from the derivation of the @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 relations involving the @xmath8 or @xmath14 bands because of specific problems in these bands . to avoid confusion ,",
    "these objects have not been highlighted in the table and figures .    on this basis",
    ", we performed a least - squares fit to the data to derive all relations , adopting a break at @xmath95 ( @xmath982.95 d ) for f - mode ccs , while all fo- and so - mode pulsators were used together .",
    "the results of this work are shown in table  [ pl ] and figs  [ ply ] ,  [ plj ] , and  [ plk ] , where from top to bottom we display the f- , fo- , and so - mode @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 relations , respectively .",
    "note that the @xmath5 relations show a distinct discontinuity at @xmath95 owing to the way the data are projected in two dimensions .",
    "as far as we know , these are the first cc @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 relations ever derived that involve the @xmath8 band .",
    "the same is true for so pulsators , even if in this case the small number of objects available for the calculations ( about 70 ) and their intrinsic faintness did not allow us to obtain @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 relations to similar precision as those for f and fo pulsators ( see table  [ pl ] ) .",
    "the regressions listed in table  [ pl ] ( and in figs  [ ply ] ,  [ plj ] , and  [ plk ] ) show that the @xmath4 relations have , as expected , a larger dispersion with respect to the @xmath6 and @xmath5 relations , which show a similar scatter for all combinations of magnitudes and colors , even though the use of @xmath100 and @xmath101 give slightly better results .",
    "this is not surprising , since the general quality of the @xmath8-band data is ( moderately ) worse than that in @xmath14 . in any case",
    ", the constancy of the dispersion of all these relations is a clear indication that the elongated structure of the smc is dominating the intrinsic dispersion of these relations , which we know from lmc studies to be much smaller ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we can now compare our results with the previous investigation by @xcite .",
    "these authors derived @xmath6 relations for a variety of combinations of magnitudes and colors for smc and lmc ccs , including the nir bands @xmath102 .",
    "their photometric database relies mainly on single - epoch light curves , from which they derived average magnitudes by adopting some literature template light curves and relying on published ephemerides and amplitude ratios ( e.g. , a(@xmath14)/a(@xmath32 ) ) .",
    "it is important to note our very different approach with respect to theirs .",
    "indeed , the larger number of observed epochs ( especially in the @xmath1 band ) allowed us to adopt a template procedure without having to rely on any external information ( apart from the periods , see details in section  [ template ] ) and which is capable of achieving much higher precision of the intensity - averaged photometry for each individual cc .",
    "the relations we can compare with @xcite are the @xmath103 and @xmath9 for f and fo pulsators . the latter authors calculated these relations in different ways , either without taking into account any break or by arbitrarily imposing breaks at @xmath104 . therefore , we can compare the @xmath103 and @xmath9 relations with no break for fo pulsators ( table 1 of * ? ? ? * ) and the @xmath103 relation for f pulsators with a break at @xmath105 ( see table 3 of * ? ? ? * ) relations are not provided for different breaks , nor do they have relations for @xmath106 . to take into account that our photometry is in the vista system ,",
    "while @xcite s were in the 2mass system , we have applied the equations discussed in section  [ template ] to convert @xcite s relations to the vista system .",
    "we can now finally perform the comparison with the values listed in our table  [ pl ] .",
    "we obtain very good agreement for the three @xmath6 relations quoted above , in all cases within @xmath107 . however , we emphasize that the precision for the individual cc @xmath108 magnitudes is better in our case given the larger number of observations .",
    "this is an important factor when dealing with the structure of the smc , whose study requires precise individual relative distances .",
    "the relationships derived in the previous section will be used in a forthcoming paper to study in detail the 3d structure of the smc .",
    "however , a first important use of the data presented in this paper is the estimation of the relative distance between the two mcs . in turn",
    ", the assumption of a distance for the lmc , which can be more safely determined with respect to the smc s ( since the smc is so significantly elongated ) , allows us to provide an estimate of the absolute distance to the smc ( or , rather , of the center defined by the cc distribution ) .",
    "we hence proceeded using our own data published in @xcite for the ccs in the lmc .",
    "this is justified because ( i ) we used data in the same photometric system , ( ii ) we obtained a @xmath9 relation with very low dispersion for the lmc ccs , and ( iii ) we also provided an absolute distance estimate for the lmc .",
    "the technique adopted is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figmc ] , where we compare the @xmath9 relations for f- and fo - mode pulsators ( top and bottom panels , respectively ) .",
    "first , observing the period distribution of the ccs in the lmc and the fact that the slope of the lmc s @xmath9 relation is very close to the slope we have found here for the smc ccs characterized by @xmath109 , we used this latter relation for our comparison of f - mode pulsators . nonetheless , the slopes of the relations for both f- and fo - mode pulsators are slightly different for the lmc and smc ( which is possibly related to a weak but significant metallicity dependence ) .",
    "indeed , it is possible to describe the difference in @xmath110 , which translates directly into a difference in distance modulus @xmath111 as a function of period with two simple equations :    @xmath112    where @xmath113 means the difference in distance modulus of smc and lmc , and the errors take into account the uncertainties in both the lmc and smc relations . to use eq .",
    "[ deltamu1 ] and  [ deltamu2 ] , we have to fix pivoting periods to determine the @xmath113 values . after some tests we chose @xmath73 d and @xmath84 d for f- and fo - mode pulsators , respectively .",
    "these values are approximately in the middle of the period range for both pulsator types , but it is easy to verify that the results do not depend significantly on this choice .",
    "the result of this exercise gives : @xmath114 mag and @xmath115 mag , in excellent mutual agreement .",
    "averaging the two results we obtain our best estimate for the relative distance between the mcs : @xmath10 mag .",
    "this value is in good agreement with that derived in a similar fashion by @xcite , especially with their result for fo pulsators : @xmath116 mag , while for f - mode ccs they find @xmath117 mag .",
    "our estimate is somewhat larger than those quotes in other papers based on different standard candles ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a large compilation of distance differentials ) .",
    "for example , @xcite found @xmath118 from the tip of the red - giant branch , while using rr lyrae stars @xcite found a significantly smaller value , @xmath119 mag .",
    "according to @xcite , type ii cepheids ( w vir ) yield @xmath120 or @xmath121 mag ( depending on the use of nir or optical data , respectively ) .",
    "in general , table 4 of @xcite , where they list several literature results , seems to suggest that all evaluations of the @xmath113 based on ccs provide larger values with respect to those based on population ii indicators .",
    "this can be due to the very different spatial distribution among ccs ( typically showing a disk - like location in both mcs ) and population ii tracers ( e.g. , rr lyrae stars , type ii cepheids , which are more evenly distributed around a sort of spheroid in both mcs ) , as shown , e.g. , by @xcite .    the absolute distance to the smc can be determined by simply adding to the @xmath113 estimated above the preferred absolute distance for the lmc .",
    "there are hundreds of such estimates in the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a thorough review ) , but here we will consider in particular two values : ( 1 ) @xmath122 mag obtained in our previous work on lmc ccs @xcite , and ( 2 ) @xmath123 , accurately estimated by @xcite on the basis of an eclipsing cepheid binary star . as a result",
    ", we obtain : ( 1 ) @xmath11 mag and ( 2 ) @xmath124 mag .",
    "these values are formally in agreement within @xmath125 with that obtained in @xcite by averaging a large number of literature estimates : @xmath126 mag . however , as noted by these latter authors , the systematic uncertainty on this determination , caused by different sources ( mainly the complex smc geometry and its elongation along the line of sight ) , can be as large as 0.150.20 mag .",
    "in this paper we have presented the vmc survey s light curves for 4172 ccs in the smc .",
    "the majority of the objects have optical @xmath15 data as well as identification and periods from the ogleiii survey , while 13 ccs have been identified by the eros2 survey .",
    "our data set consists of @xmath8 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 light curves with the number of epochs typically ranging from 4 to 12 in @xmath8 and @xmath14 , and 13 to 36 in @xmath1 .",
    "we used our best light curves in each filter to construct samples of eight templates covering the full variety of periods and light - curve shapes .",
    "these templates have been used to automatically perform least - squares fits to the observations by varying both the amplitude and the phasing , and eventually choosing the best - fitting template by means of appropriately chosen parameters .",
    "we provide intensity - averaged magnitudes and peak - to - peak amplitudes in the @xmath8 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 filters .",
    "to estimate reliable uncertainties on these values , we carried out monte carlo simulations , producing 100 mock light curves , adding gaussian errors to the actual data for each cc in each filter , and running the template - fitting procedure from scratch each time .",
    "this process allowed us to assess the reliability of our template - fitting procedure and estimate robust uncertainties on cc magnitudes and amplitudes .",
    "the intensity - averaged magnitudes in the vista @xmath8 , @xmath14 , and @xmath1 filters have been complemented with optical @xmath3-band data and periods to construct a variety of @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 relations for the ccs in the smc .",

    "we also presented the first nir @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath5 relations for so pulsators to date .",

    "lmc distance and , in turn , the absolute distance of the smc . for the former ,",
    "we derive @xmath10 mag , a value that is in rather good agreement with other evaluations based on ccs , but in disagreement ( significantly larger ) with estimates based on ( old ) population ii distance indicators .",
