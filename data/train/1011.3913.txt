    "the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) is a minimal model for many traffic and queueing processes @xcite .",
    "it describes a non - equilibrium system of many driven particles , interacting via hard core repulsion .",
    "this markov process is defined on a lattice , each site of which can be empty or occupied by one particle .",
    "particles jump independently after an exponentially distributed random time with mean @xmath2 to a nearest neighbor site on the right or on the left , provided that the target site is empty ( hard core exclusion rule ) . the probability to choose the right neighbour is @xmath3 while the probability of choosing the left neighbour is @xmath4 . in spite of its simple formulation , and very simple product stationary state ,",
    "the time - dependent characteristics are very nontrivial to obtain , even in the simplest periodic one - dimensional case ( closed ring of @xmath5 sites ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that e.g. the time - dependent operators of type @xmath6 are complicated objects because the generator of the stochastic dynamics @xmath7 is equivalent to an interacting many - body quantum hamiltonian .",
    "recently , it has been found that the asep , under the restriction to produce an extreme flux or extreme activity is governed by effective long range interactions @xcite . in this",
    "setting one considers realizations of the process for a duration @xmath8 which for a long interval between large times @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( where @xmath10 is itself also large ) have carried an atypically large flux . this extreme event quite surprisingly makes the conditioned process intrinsically related to a much simpler system than the original one , namely to a system of non - interacting fermions .",
    "this fact suggests to use field theoretic free fermion techniques to compute time - dependent correlations in this particular large deviation limit of the classical stochastic dynamics of the conditioned asep .    in the present contribution we shall employ these techniques to calculate two particular time - dependent correlation functions : the conditional probabilities @xmath11 for the transition from a microscopic @xmath12-particle initial configuration @xmath13 to a final configuration @xmath14 at time @xmath9 and the dynamical structure factor which is the fourier transform of the time - dependent density - density correlation function @xmath15 in the stationary asep in the two above mentioned limits : under the restriction to produce a very large flux and under the restriction to produce a very large activity .",
    "we note that for the totally asymmetric version of the asep ( tasep ) on an infinite lattice and on a ring the conditional probabilities were found in @xcite and @xcite respectively using the bethe ansatz .",
    "the dynamical structure for the infinite system was obtained by prhofer and spohn using random matrix techniques @xcite .",
    "we remark that that the time - dependent correlations for atypical stochastic trajectories ( in the large deviation limit ) are practically unaccessible by numerical methods , even though some promising approaches have been developed recently @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ condition ] we introduce the asep conditioned to carry a certain nontypical flux or to exhibit a nontypical activity . in the first two subsections we review for self - containedness the our previous work @xcite which among other things clarifies how conditioning on large flux and activity is related to free fermions . in the third subsection of sec .",
    "[ condition ] we present a new result , viz .",
    "the form of temporal correlations in the large current or large activity regime . in the following main sections we focus on large flux and derive the conditional transition probabilities ( sec . [ probabilities ] ) and dynamical structure factor ( sec . [ structure ] ) .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary and some remarks on the large limit activity in the asep and symmetric exclusion .",
    "the flux ( or synonymously the current ) in the asep is the mean net number of jumps in some time interval .",
    "conditioning the asep to carry an typical flux is achieved by first ascribing to the asep space - time trajectories weighting factors @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a generalized chemical potential , conjugated to the total current @xmath18 , registered along the trajectory up to time @xmath9 ( see e.g. @xcite for a elaborate treatment ) . fixing @xmath17 , one picks up an ensemble of space - time trajectories characterized by any desired average current @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , fixing the desired current to be very large ( in the sense described in the introduction ) , one obtains a particular set of trajectories , where several tendencies are clearly seen @xcite when taking the limit @xmath20 : ( a ) the backward hoppings are totally suppressed ( b ) formation of clusters of particles , potentially leading to the flux reduction , is strongly suppressed ( c ) long range interactions between the particles are generated .    in more details , it was noted that the asep under the restriction to produce extreme flux after proper rescaling of time is described by a master equation @xmath21 with effective stochastic hamiltonian@xmath22 where @xmath23 is a diagonal matrix with positive entries given further below , and @xmath24 is the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath7 @xmath25 with the spin 1/2 lowering and raising operators of the lie algebra @xmath26 .",
    "we point out that in the limit of very large flux the same stochastic process describes the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) or even the symmetric case , since in this limit any backward hopping does not contribute .",
    "similar considerations can be carried out for the activity where space - time trajectories are weighted by a factor @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the total number of jumps along the trajectory , irrespective of the direction of the jump . in the case of asep",
    "restricted to have an extremely large activity ( counting hoppings , irrespective of the direction ) , the effective hamiltonian has the form ( [ heff ] ) where @xmath7 is substituted by @xmath29 and @xmath24 is  substituted by the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the hopping rate to the right ( clockwise ) while @xmath32 is the hopping rate to the left ( anti - clockwise ) of the asep . both hamiltonians ( [ unidirxx0]),([asepactivity ] ) are free fermion hamiltonians , and in particular for the case of symmetric hopping @xmath33 , the so called symmetric simple exclusion process , or ssep , the dynamics",
    "is governed by the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) with @xmath7  substituted by the physical @xmath34 hamiltonian describing quantum fermions on a ring of @xmath5 sites , @xmath35 and @xmath24  substituted by the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath36 .",
    "all the above mentioned hamiltonians commute with each other and share the same ground state @xmath37 .",
    "the components of @xmath37 in the natural basis constitute the respective entries of the diagonal matrix @xmath23 from ( [ heff ] ) @xmath38 . by the perron - frobenius theorem the ground state is nondegenerate , all its components are positive @xmath39 , so the matrix @xmath40 exists .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the stationary state ( the state with zero eigenvalue ) of the stochastic process ( [ masterequation ] ) is given by @xmath41 .",
    "the stationary state is thus common for all hamiltonians mentioned above , for details see @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it may be worthwhile noting that the effective process is an interesting object of study in its own right , i.e. , without reference to atypically large currents in the usual asep .",
    "this process is a totally asymmetric exclusion process with long - range interaction .",
    "it describes nearest neighbour hopping , but the hopping rate depends on the positions of the other particles .",
    "specifically , the move of the @xmath42-th particle , located at position @xmath43 in a configuration @xmath14 , to the consecutive position @xmath44 in the new configuration @xmath45 has the rate @xcite @xmath46 where the product is over @xmath47 and @xmath42 from 1 through @xmath12 . if the target site @xmath44 is occupied , the hopping rate is zero , in agreement with the exclusion rule .    for the case of extreme activity one obtains in the same fashion a partially asymmetric or symmetric exclusion process with long range interaction .",
    "the symmetric case has been studied some time ago by spohn @xcite who derived a hydrodynamic fluctuation theory for the large scale dynamics of the process .",
    "noticing that fluctuations are driven by a gaussian field he presented a general form of the dynamical structure function which represents a universality different from the edwards wilkinson equation .",
    "he also noted the link of the hopping rates ( [ hoppingrates ] ) to dyson s brownian motion , which was pointed out independently in @xcite for the totally asymmetric case .",
    "thus our discrete model has a natural interpretation as a discrete , biased random walk version of dyson s brownian motion driven by an external field .",
    "the complete set of eigenstates of @xmath48 and @xmath36 in a sector with @xmath12 particles is characterized by a combination of @xmath12 plane waves where each plane has a quasimomentum @xmath49 satisfying @xmath50 because of the periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "therefore each @xmath49 takes one of the quantized values @xmath51 and thus each eigenstate is defined by an @xmath12-tuple of integers @xmath52 where each @xmath53 . with these definitions we can write the eigenvectors as @xmath54 where the vector @xmath55 denotes a state with particles at respective positions @xmath56 ( not necessarily ordered ) and the sum is over all possible particle positions @xmath57",
    "the free fermion wave function in coordinate representation has the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a permutation of indexes @xmath60 and @xmath61 denotes the sign of the permutation .",
    "the factor @xmath62 is zero if in the set @xmath63 some @xmath56 coincide , and otherwise is equal to @xmath64 or @xmath65 , depending on whether the set @xmath63 was obtained from the ordered set by an even or odd number of pair permutations .",
    "any exchange of particle positions or quasimomenta results in the eigenfunction @xmath66 changing sign , which reflects the pauli principle .",
    "the states @xmath66 with all possible sets @xmath67 are normalized , orthogonal and form an orthonormal basis in the respective sector of hilbert space with @xmath12 number of particles .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath68 corresponding to the @xmath66 are sums of those for each quasiparticle @xmath69 where the quasiparticle energies are @xmath70 for the hamiltonians ( [ unidirxx0]),([asepactivity ] ) and ( [ xx0 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the ground state @xmath71 which minimizes the energies @xmath72 is characterized by the choice of quasimomenta @xmath73 where @xmath74 , i.e. for the set @xmath75 for this choice the ground state energies @xmath76 for all three cases are real . in the following by default",

    "the basis of our present work is the following simple , but fundamental property of conditioned processes of the form ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "* theorem*. let the operators @xmath82 be diagonal in the natural basis defined by @xmath83 .",
