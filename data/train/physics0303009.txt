    "since the famous experiments of taylor @xcite in long cylinders many experimental and theoretical investigations of the interesting phenomena of arising and evolution of taylor vortices were done .",
    "the main part of these studies was devoted to cases of long cylinders .",
    "it was done under the assumption that a sufficiently long cylinder and periodic boundary conditions will emulate the infinitely long cylindrical region well .",
    "in addition such regions are convenient for theoretical investigations .",
    "the experimental investigations of short cylinders started much later and gave surprising results ( see , for example , benjamin and mullin @xcite ) , which indicated that the zone and the magnitude of the influence of the caps of the cylinders is much bigger and takes effect on the type of motion in the whole region .",
    "it was assumed that close to the caps of the cylinders the boundary layer is directed from the outer to the inner cylinder as a result of the existence of an ekmans boundary layer .",
    "however , the experiments gave a more complicated picture of the motions .",
    "there exists also an atypical layer in opposite direction , i.e. from the inner to the outer cylinder connected withe the existence of the anomalous mode. the first mathematical model which took the influence of the cylinder caps into account was represented in the work of schaeffer @xcite .",
    "this model is not very consistent and needs improvements .",
    "the role of the anomalous mode was studied later numerically and experimentally in the works of cliffe et al @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the transient features of the circular couette flow were investigated in laboratory and numerical experiments ( using the commercial program _ nekton _",
    "( fluent gmbh ) by neitzel et al @xcite .",
    "the results of the numerical experiments were close to the laboratory experiments . in case of short cylinders with an aspect ratio @xmath2 ( relation of annulus span to the annulus gap width , defined in section  [ main ] ) usually only one pair of taylor vortices",
    "arises . in general , this case is considered to be not really interesting due to the poorness of the patterns to be expected .",
    "but in the experiments of aitta et al @xcite a series of interesting flow patterns for short cylinders was found .",
    "a non - equilibrium tricritical points occurs when a forward bifurcation becomes a backward bifurcation . in the taylor - couette problem",
    "the tricritical point can be observed for @xmath3 in the classical case of a pure rotation of the inner cylinder without axial flow as demonstrated in @xcite and later in @xcite .",
    "the system of two vortices is symmetrical if the rotation velocity does not exceed a critical velocity @xmath4 if the velocity of the flow is larger , @xmath5 , then one vortex grows at the expense of the other one . in the case of the forward bifurcation",
    "the symmetry is broken continuously and in the case of the backward bifurcation - abruptly . in the phase transition language",
    "this is a bifurcation of the second order or first order correspondingly @xcite .",
    "the continuous transition was observed for @xmath6 and the abrupt one for @xmath7 where @xmath8    an exhaustive study of the influence of the finite length effects is done for the classical arrangement of two concentric cylinders with a very small aspect ratio @xmath9 $ ] and a relatively large annulus with a radius ratio ( relation between the radii of inner and outer cylinders , see section  [ main ] ) of @xmath10 for moderate reynolds numbers @xmath11 $ ] in the work of furukava , watanabe , toya & nakamura @xcite in the case when the inner cylinder is rotating .",
    "the numerical investigations were verified by experiments .",
    "the three main flow patterns were found which correspond to a normal two - cell mode , an anomalous one - cell mode and a twin - cell mode . a steady case as well as an unsteady mode of",
    "the fully developed flow different from wavy taylor - couette flow were obtained .",
    "there exists a series of experimental and theoretical works devoted to the linear stability of the taylor - couette problem with implosed axial effects .",
    "the first such analysis was done for the case of axisymmetric disturbances in a narrow gap @xcite , @xcite . in the work of marques and lopez @xcite the linear stability of the flow in the annulus between two infinitely long cylinders , driven by a constant rotation and harmonic oscillation in the axial direction of the inner cylinder",
    "was analyzed using floquet theory .",
    "the axial effects in the taylor - couette problem were studied in the work @xcite on two different flows . in the first one the axial effect",
    "is introduced by an inertial axial sliding mechanism between the cylinders and in the other one via an imposed axial pressure gradient . in all cases",
    "the annular gap is much larger as in our case and the radius ratio is @xmath12 the stabilizing effect of a periodical axial flow was studied in the works @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in the work of lueptow",
    "@xcite the stability problem of a taylor - couette flow with axial and radial flow was studied for a relatively large radius ratio @xmath13 and pressure - drive axial flow in the whole annulus . in all these studies",
    "it was found that the axial flow stabilized the taylor - couette flow and enables a lot of super critical states with a rich variety of patterns .",
    "nevertheless the theory of the taylor - couette flow is by far from being complete , so for instance the stability problem for the system of taylor vortices and a classical couette flow by influencing control of the cylinder caps .",
    "it is also a little bit astonishing that the exact analytical solution for the couette flow profile with boundary conditions on cylinder caps was obtained only recently in the work of wendl @xcite . his results",
    "expose a strong influence of the caps on the flow profile .",
    "the difference between the two profiles with and without finite - length effects is approximately a logarithmic function of the aspect ratio @xmath14 for a wide range of radius ratios @xmath15 .",
    "the solution is given in form of a slowly convergent series which contains trigonometric and bessel functions . to give a qualitative analysis of instabilities one takes an exact solution as a base flow to linearize the navier - stokes equations .",
    "this type of solutions is not convenient to pursue the topic further towards analytical studies of the instabilities .    in the present work we use the theory of small perturbations to study the instability of the laminar couette flow in a short cylinder .",
    "the geometry of an annular gap and the boundary conditions are given in the section  [ main ] .",
    "our idea was to get an analytical formula which is simpler than that in @xcite but which gives us an approximation of the couette flow with finite - length effects which is as good as that found in @xcite . in the section  [ sero ]",
    "we describe this solution and discuss the region of applicability of the done approximation .",
    "the solution obtained for a short cylinder is well suitable as a base flow for a comprehensive study of instability effects .",
    "this study is represented in the section  [ loc ] .",
    "the onset of the instability is predicted using the method of local analysis , in which the equations governing the flow perturbation are linearized . for the very reason that the appearance of an instability depends not only on the base flow but also on the amplitude and the type of the flow perturbation two different types of perturbations",
    "are studied in this section .",
    "we consider the sensitivity of the couette flow under small perturbations corresponding to an axial flow which is the most important for industrial applications .",
    "we take the case of a very narrow annulus @xmath16 which is typical for bearing or sealing systems and in contrary to general expectation we get a rich family of flow states .",
    "we proved that the axial flow stabilizes the taylor - couette flow also in case of very short cylinders and narrow annular gap with axial flow directed as a thin layer along the surface of the inner rotating cylinder .",
    "the elaborate series of the numerical experiment was done with help of the fluent 5.5/6.0 .",
    "the detailed description of the grids used and others numerical facilities is given in the section  [ sec7 ] .",
    "the change from one laminar flow to another or a transition from a laminar flow to turbulence is a function of the base flow considered as well as of the type of small perturbations .",
    "we found a rich family of typical patterns on large intervals of reynolds numbers .",
    "the results of the numerical experiments are discussed in the section  [ resul ] .",
    "the study of the couette - taylor problem for the parameters defined below was stimulated by the industrial project @xcite . in many technical systems the problem of transmitting energy and momentum is solved using shafts and corresponding bushes with or without radial sealing . in a typical situation one is concerned with a small taylor - couette annulus , narrow slits in between cylinders and with axial and tangential oscillations or with a weak axial flow along the surface of the inner cylinder . in general , these systems are very complicated and it is necessary to study more simple problems in order to isolate a particular mechanism and to develop and test hypotheses governing their behavior .",
    "we separate here only one of the most typical cases because of its technological importance and , from a fundamental point of view , for its rich dynamics and try to describe all possible flow states in this case .",

    "the radius of the inner cylinder will be denoted by @xmath35 in dimensionless units which will be used in all sections of this paper .",
    "the entrance way and the outgoing way for the axial flow are very thin cylindrical slits with the gap width @xmath36 and the annulus span of slits denoted by @xmath37 the slits are long and narrow in comparison to the main annulus i.e. @xmath38 @xmath39 the ends of the slits narrow conical to the lower order of scale that means the most narrow part of the slit has the width @xmath40 which is very small , @xmath41 . a more detailed picture of the slits is given in fig .",
    "[ 2dgrid ] .",
    "the studied flow states are very sensitive to the kind of perturbations .",
    "so we try to construct a situation which is most adapted to technical facilities and imitate the sealing arrangements with conical tapering slits .",
    "it is characteristically for quite all technical applications that the sealing medium is oil with non vanishing viscosity .",
    "we will consider in our work an incompressible viscous fluid in the cylindrical annulus .",
    "the classical case of the couette flow of an incompressible viscous fluid in an annulus between two cylinders was investigated analytically in @xcite . in comparison to the famous work of taylor the author studied cylinders of a finite length and got a much more complicated formula which describes the influence of the cylinder caps on the flow . as follows from experiments of kageyama ( @xcite ) if the reynolds number grows the influence of the ekmans layer drops along the cylinder caps . as a result",
    "the profile of the solutions differs more and more from the pure couette solution because of the arising of secondary flows in the annulus .",

    "for all components of the perturbation vector @xmath117 and their derivatives taylor series are used which are truncated after the first two terms . from the physical point of view",
    "we assume that the perturbation scale is much smaller than the typical scale of the axial inhomogeneity in the taylor - couette system .",

    "the study of the stability problem of the couette flow was done up to now for arbitrary small perturbations .",

    "this flow can be generated by the pair of taylor vortices or an axial flow through the narrow slits in the caps of the cylinders near the surface of the inner cylinder as shown in figure  [ k2 ] .    in order to simplify the study we suggest that the axial velocity @xmath136 has a nonzero value @xmath137 on the surface of the inner cylinder .",

    "if now a small perturbation amplified the circulation in one of the vortices for a small interval of time then radial gradients of the axial velocity will show up in different parts of the gap .",
