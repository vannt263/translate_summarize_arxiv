    "the great majority of the physics community believes that quantum mechanics is a universal and fundamental theory , applicable to any physical system , from which classical physics can be recovered .",
    "the universe is , of course , a valid physical system : there is a theoretical model , the standard cosmological model , which is able to describe it in physical terms , and make predictions which can be confirmed or refuted by observations . in fact , the observations until now confirm the standard cosmological scenario ( even though important tensions exist , like the unexpected results that first came from supernova data in 1998 @xcite ) . hence ,",
    "supposing the universality of quantum mechanics , the universe itself must be described by quantum theory , from which we could recover classical cosmology .",
    "however , the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite , which is the one taught in undergraduate courses and employed by the majority of physicists in all areas , can not be used in a quantum theory of cosmology .",
    "this is because it imposes the existence of a classical domain or of an external agent outside the physical system . in von neumann s view , for instance , the necessity of an external agent , comes from the way it solves the measurement problem ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a good discussion ) . in an impulsive measurement of some observable",
    ", the wave function of the observed system plus macroscopic apparatus splits into many branches which almost do not overlap ( in order to be a good measurement ) , each one containing the observed system in an eigenstate of the measured observable , and the pointer of the apparatus pointing to the respective eigenvalue .",
    "however , in the end of the measurement , we observe only one of these eigenvalues , and the measurement is robust in the sense that if we repeat it immediately after , we obtain the same result .",
    "so it seems that the wave function collapses into one of the branches , the others disappear .",
    "the copenhagen interpretation assumes that this collapse is real .",
    "however , a real collapse can not be described by the unitary schrdinger evolution .",
    "hence , the copenhagen interpretation must assume that there is a fundamental process in a measurement which must occur outside the quantum world , by an external agent in a classical domain .",
    "of course , if we want to quantize the whole universe , there is no place for a classical domain or any external agent outside it , and the copenhagen interpretation can not be applied .    in order to save the situation",
    ", one could try to evoke the phenomenon of decoherence @xcite .",
    "in fact , the interaction of the observed quantum system with its environment yields an effective diagonalization of the reduced density matrix , obtained by tracing out the irrelevant degrees of freedom .",
    "decoherence can explain why the splitting of the wave function is given in terms of the pointer basis states , and why we do not see superpositions of macroscopic objects . in this way ,",
    "classical properties emerge from quantum theory without the need of being assumed . in the framework of quantum gravity",
    ", it can also explain how a classical background geometry can emerge in a quantum universe @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is the first quantity to become classical .",
    "however , decoherence is not yet a complete answer to the measurement problem @xcite .",
    "it does not explain the apparent collapse after the measurement is completed , or why all but one of the diagonal elements of the density matrix become null when the measurement is finished .",
    "the theory is unable to give an account of the existence of facts , their uniqueness as opposed to the multiplicity of possible phenomena .",
    "further developments are still in progress , like the consistent histories approach @xcite , which are however incomplete until now .    hence , if someone insists with the copenhagen interpretation , at least in its present form , she or he must assume that quantum theory is not universal , that quantum cosmology does not make any sense at all , and we are stuck .",
    "this is a perfect example of the adequacy of albert einstein sentence : `` contemporary quantum theory  constitutes an optimum formulation of [ certain ] connections  [ but ] offers no useful point of departure for future developments . ''",
    "fortunately , there are some alternative solutions to this quantum cosmological dilemma which can solve the measurement problem maintaining the universality of quantum theory .",
    "one can say that the schrdinger evolution is an approximation of a more fundamental non - linear theory which can accomplish the collapse @xcite , or that the collapse is effective but not real , in the sense that the other branches disappear from the observer but do not disappear from existence . in this second category",
    "we can cite the many - worlds interpretation ( mw ) @xcite and the de broglie - bohm theory ( dbb ) @xcite . in the former , all the possibilities in the splitting",
    "are actually realized . in each branch",
    "there is an observer with the knowledge of the corresponding eigenvalue of this branch , but she or he is not aware of the other observers and the other possibilities because the branches do not interfere . in the latter , a point - particle in configuration space describing the observed system and apparatus",
    "is supposed to exist , independently on any observations . in the splitting",
    ", this point particle will enter into one of the branches ( depending on the initial position of the point particle before the measurement , which is unknown ) , and the other branches will be empty .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the empty waves can neither interact with other particles , nor with the point particle containing the apparatus .",
    "hence , no observer can be aware of the other branches which are empty .",
    "again we have an effective but not real collapse ( the empty waves continue to exist ) , but now with no multiplication of observers .",
    "of course these theories can be used in quantum cosmology .",
    "schrdinger evolution is always valid , and there is no need of a classical domain or any external agent outside the physical system .",
    "we call quantum cosmology @xcite as this attempt to apply quantum theory to the universe as a whole . in the following",
    ", we will apply the de broglie - bohm ( dbb ) theory to quantum cosmology .",
    "one of the important results is the elimination of cosmological singularities which has been proved at least for some particular but relevant cases . in general",
    ", it may depend on the chosen initial state , according to the cosmological model which has been taken . as we know , the singularity theorems @xcite show that , under reasonable physical assumptions , the universe has developed an initial singularity , which is called the big bang , and will develop future singularities in the form of black holes and , perhaps , of a big crunch . until now",
    ", singularities are out of the scope of any physical theory , hence one should assume that the ` reasonable physical assumptions ' of the theorems are not valid under extreme situations of very high energy density and curvature , which is very plausible .",
    "we may say that general relativity or any other matter field theory must be changed under these extreme conditions .",
    "one good point of view ( which is not the only one ) is to think that quantum gravitational effects become important .",
    "we should then construct a quantum theory of gravitation and apply it to cosmology .",
    "this is a good strategy because , besides the possibility of obtaining from quantum gravity a solution to the singularity problem , we gain from quantum theory the possibility of constructing a theory of initial conditions for the universe .",
    "this theory could then explain why the universe is remarkably homogeneous and isotropic , and even why the constants of nature have the values we observe they have .",
    "moreover , it could give the spectrum of quantum fluctuations of geometry and matter of primordial origin and provide us with a complete theory of structure formation .    however , there is no complete and well founded theory of quantum gravity . in the covariant perturbative approach ,",
    "the best candidate is string theory .",
    "however , string theory is not yet predictive about the field theory that should be valid in the physical domain of 4-dimensional space - time dimensions , and their standard particles states .",
    "nonperturbative quantum gravity , like loop quantum gravity , has also a lot of unresolved problems ( complicate constraint equations , unclear classical limit , etc ) .",
    "the application of quantum gravity to cosmology adds new problems , as we mentioned above . how do we interpret and extract results from the wave function of the universe",
    "how can we recover the standard cosmological model ? finally , in quantum mechanics , time , in spite of seeming to be a measurable physical quantity , is not treated as an observable ( hermitian operator ) but as an external evolution parameter ( @xmath0-number ) . in the quantum cosmology of a closed universe",
    ", there is no place for an external parameter .",
    "so , what happens with time ; does it become an operator ?",
    "these are some of the difficult issues which the subject of quantum cosmology has to give an answer in order to have a meaning .    in this review",
    "we will try to explain the ideas on how one can deal with some of these deep issues concerning quantum cosmology within the framework of the de broglie - bohm quantum theory .",
    "in fact , the simple hypothesis of the objective physical reality of trajectories in the configuration space of fields and particles governed by a suitable dynamical law , from which probabilistic concepts become secondary , yields a framework where many of these problems become less contrived and capable to be solved .",
    "in the next section we will review the standard canonical quantization of general relativity , which leads to the so called wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "we know that there are much better mathematical implementations of nonperturbative quantum general relativity , like loop quantum gravity @xcite or path integral quantization @xcite , but our aim here is to apply our ideas to quantum cosmology , where the resulting quantum equations of these approaches should be quite similar ( or even coincide , if one is not so close to the planck scale ) under the restricted domain of degrees of freedom of homogeneous spaces with linear perturbations on it , characteristic of the standard classical cosmological model . in section 3 , we will present three of the most used quantum theories applied to quantum cosmology , the many worlds theory ( mw ) , the consistent histories approach ( ch ) , and the de broglie - bohm theory ( dbb ) . in section 4 , we will show how some basic problems of quantum cosmology can be solved in the light of the de broglie - bohm theory . in section 5 , we will compare the de broglie - bohm results with other approaches , and discuss the reasons for some unexpected discrepancies . in section 6 , we will extend the cosmological models from which we have obtained the results of the preceding sections , and introduce perturbations on them in order to obtain results concerning structure formation and the anisotropies of the cosmic background radiation , which could be tested by the new cosmological observations which will be implemented in the near future .",
    "we end up with the conclusions in section 7 .",
    "we end this introduction by refereeing the reader to other investigations concerning the de dbb approach in cosmology and quantum black holes @xcite",
    "as we have explained in the introduction , quantum cosmology is the application of a theory of quantum gravity to the universe as a whole . however , until now , there is no consistent and widely accepted theory of quantum gravity .",
    "as we have seen , there are two basic ways to quantize gravity : the covariant and the canonical approaches .",
    "we will focus here on the canonical one , which is essentially non - perturbative . but can quantum general relativity make sense if its perturbation expansion is not renormalizable ?",
    "the answer is affirmative .",
    "there are examples of theories that are exactly solvable non - perturbatively but which perturbation expansion is not renormalizable @xcite .",
    "non - perturbative technics are also being developed in superstring theory , but we will stay in the framework of general relativity itself and present the canonical quantization of this theory .",
    "the canonical approach is based on the hamiltonian of general relativity .",
    "the idea is to obtain a quantum functional equation for a wave functional , which is analogous to the schrdinger equation . for historical reasons ,",
    "this approach is not very popular in other quantum field theories .",
    "some papers have been published with comparisons of this approach with the more usual covariant approach in quantum electrodynamics and other quantum field theories @xcite . to construct the hamiltonian of general relativity we must assume that spacetime can be splitted into a family of spacelike hypersurfaces and a timelike direction .",
    "it means that we are restricting the topology of the manifold to be of the type : @xmath1 .",
    "hence , we are discarding spacetimes with rotation and with closed timelike curves .",
    "questions about the existence of closed timelike curves can not be answered within this formalism .",
    "let us now split the metric into the timelike direction and the spacelike direction .",
    "the spacelike hypersurfaces can be defined by the equations @xmath2 .",
    "their normals are given by one - forms @xmath3 .",
    "as they are spacelike , there is always a timelike coordinate @xmath4 that parametrizes the hypersurfaces yielding @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is a normalization factor , @xmath7 , which implies that @xmath8 .",
    "the projector onto the hypersurfaces is given by @xmath9 whose components are @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . defining @xmath13 ,",
    "the components of the contravariant metric are : @xmath14    we can calculate the inverse covariant metric @xmath15 yielding the following line element : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the inverse of @xmath19 and it is , by contruction , the intrinsic covariant metric of the spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "examining eq .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) we can see that @xmath20 is the rate of change with respect to the coordinate time @xmath21 of the proper time of an observer with four - velocity @xmath22 at the point@xmath23 .",
    "it is called the lapse function . also , @xmath24 is the rate of change with respect to coordinate time @xmath21 of the shift of the points with the same label @xmath25 when we go from one hypersurface to another .",
    "it is called the shift function .",
    "it can also be viewed as the projection onto the spacelike hypersurface of the tangent vector @xmath26 to the @xmath21-time coordinate curves . for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another useful quantity is the extrinsic curvature .",
    "it measures how much the 3-dimensional hypersurfaces are curved with respect to the 4-dimensional manifold in which it is embedded .",
    "it does that by comparing the normal vector @xmath27 at one point with the parallel transported normal vector from a neighbor point to this same point .",
    "precisely , it is defined as follows : @xmath28    the relevant components of the extrinsic curvature are : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the 3-dimensional covariant derivative .    using eqs .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) , ( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) , we obtain for the four - dimensional ricci scalar : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the 3-dimensional ricci scalar , and hence , for the einstein - hilbert lagrangian density , after discarding surface terms ,    @xmath33=nh^{1/2}(r^{(3)}+k^{ij}k_{ij}-k^2 ) .\\ ] ]    let us now construct the hamiltonian of general relativity",
    ". as the lagrangian density ( [ 36 ] ) does not depend on @xmath34 and on @xmath35 , their canonical conjugate momenta are zero .",
    "these are the so called primary constraints . therefore , general relativity is a theory with constraints and it will be treated with the dirac formalism @xcite .",
    "the canonical momenta conjugate to @xmath19 are given by : @xmath36    for consistency , the primary constraints must be conserved in time .",
    "this implies the following weak equations : @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 which is called the dewitt metric .",
    "they are secondary constraints and are called super - hamiltonian and super - momentum constraints , respectively .",
    "their conservations in time do not lead to any new constraints .",
    "an straightforward calculation then shows that the hamiltonian of general relativity is simply given by : @xmath40    as @xmath6 and @xmath41 have no dynamics and they multiply secondary constraints in the total hamiltonian , they can be viewed as lagrangian multipliers of these constraints , and they can be eliminated from the phase space of the theory @xcite .    it can be shown that the secondary constraints have weakly zero poisson brackets among each other .",
    "they are called first class constraints and they are generators of gauge transformations .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that : @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the lie derivative along the infinitesimal spacelike vector @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the lie derivative along the direction orthogonal to the spacelike hypersurfaces with metric @xmath18 .",
    "the function @xmath47 is infinitesimal .",
    "analogous results can be obtained for the momenta @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the first constraint is the generator of spatial coordinate transformations while the second one is the generator of time reparametrization , which are the gauge transformations of the theory . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ 305 ] ) , the second constraint is connected to time evolution .",
    "let us then quantize the theory .",
    "we will work in the @xmath18 representation .",
    "the wave function @xmath49 $ ] must satisfy the schrdinger - like functional equation : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the operator coming from the classical hamiltonian ( [ 303 ] ) .",
    "for the first constraints ( [ h01 ] ) and ( [ hi ] ) , dirac rules impose that @xmath52 @xmath53    if eqs .",
    "( [ 320 ] ) and ( [ 321 ] ) are correct , then the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) is zero , and it implies that @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath21 .    equation ( [ 321 ] ) has a simple meaning .",
    "it states that the value of the wave function does not change if the spacelike metric changes by a spatial coordinate transformation .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ 321 ] ) implies that the wave function is a functional of the equivalence class of metrics which describe the same geometry , not of one particular metric .",
    "it is a functional defined on the space of all spacelike geometries , not on the space of all spacelike metrics .",
    "the space of all three - dimensional spacelike geometries is called superspace .",
    "this is the quantum version of the meaning of the constraint ( [ hi ] ) , which classically is interpreted as the generator of spacelike coordinate transformations .",
    "let us turn now to the eq .",
    "( [ 320 ] ) , which is called the wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite .",
    "we should expect that the dynamics of the wave function be contained in it .",
    "there should exist one momentum which is canonically conjugate to the time in which the quantum dynamics takes place . in the reparametrization invariant formulation of non - relativistic classical mechanics of point particles ,",
    "this particular momentum is easily distinguishable from the others because it appears linearly in this equation , while the others appear quadratically @xcite .",
    "however , in eq .",
    "( [ 320 ] ) , even when one adds non - gravitational degrees of freedom , there is no momentum which appears linearly in general ( with some exceptions which we will discuss later on ) ; all of them appear quadratically . hence , where is time",
    "?    there are some proposals of solution to this problem , which is called the issue of time .",
    "we will now expose some of them :    \\i ) the dewitt metric ( [ 301 ] ) is a @xmath55 matrix per space point and it can be shown that it has signature @xmath56 @xcite . adding conventional non - gravitational degrees of freedom ( satisfying the null energy condition ) will just add other dimensions to the dewitt metric with positive signature , not altering its lorentzian nature .",
    "the minus sign is related to the square root of the determinant of the spacelike metric @xcite , @xmath57 .",
    "thus , it seems that we should identify this quantity with time .",
    "however , @xmath57 is the volume of the spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "does it mean that in a contracting universe time goes backwards ?",
    "quite unplausible . furthermore , because of the lorentzian signature of the dewitt metric , the wheeler - dewitt eq .",
    "( [ 320 ] ) is like a klein - gordon equation with a variable ` mass ' term , @xmath58 , which depends on the ` time ' @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , if we want to give some kind of probabilistic interpretation to @xmath54 , we will have to face all the problems with negative probabilities which are characteristic of this type of equation .",
    "the presence of the variable ` mass ' term turns this problem very difficult to solve @xcite , and one can not work with the single frequency approach .",
    "one possibility is to define a new inner product , as it was done in ref .",
    "this is something yet to be explored in full superspace .    in quantum field theory ,",
    "this problem is solved by second quantizing the klein - gordon field .",
    "this field operator is expanded into creation and annihilation operators of spin zero particles .",
    "the vacuum state is the state with no particles .",
    "if this quantum field is submitted to a time variable potential energy , or if it is embedded in a time variable curved background , then spin zero particles are created out of the vacuum .    for the wheeler - dewitt equation ,",
    "this procedure would lead us to a third quantization of gravity by quantizing the wave function itself @xcite .",
    "the particles are now universes that can be created by the action of creation operators which are obtained by an expansion of the wave function , which is now an operator .",
    "the vacuum state is the real nothing , the absence of matter _ and _ spacetime .",
    "since the dewitt metric ( [ 301 ] ) , as well as @xmath58 , depends on @xmath57 , which is considered here as ` time ' , this quantum wave function is like a quantum scalar field propagating in a time variable curved background and submitted to a time variable potential energy .",
    "thus , universes can be spontaneously created from nothing !",
    "this is a rather exotic and interesting picture , but with no rigorous mathematical foundations .",
    "\\ii ) we could try to identify some degrees of freedom which , playing the role of time , put the wheeler - dewitt eq .",
    "( [ 320 ] ) in a schrdinger form .",
    "this variable can come from matter degrees of freedom , and we will show in section iv that this is indeed possible if matter is described by a hydrodynamical perfect fluid .",
    "it can also come from gravitational degrees of freedom , but this is possible only implicitly @xcite .",
    "the variable that plays the role of time is the trace of @xmath48 , which is a monotonically increasing function of time whenever the dominant energy condition is satisfied .",
    "the wheeler - dewitt eq .",
    "( [ 320 ] ) is a very complicate functional differential equation , which is equivalent to an intricate system of partial differential equations , one for each space point @xmath25 .",
    "such a system is not well defined mathematically .",
    "however , one would like to investigate the problem of time and other issues related to the quantization of the universe , like the singularity problem in classical cosmology and the interpretation of the wave function of the universe , more deeply .",
    "hence , it should be a good strategy to get rid of the very difficult technical problems characteristic of the wheeler - dewitt equation in full superspace , and work in a more restricted framework .",
    "furthermore , the great degree of space homogeneity of the primordial universe suggests that this simplification can be physically reasonable when dealing with quantum cosmology .    in order to do that , one usually simplifies the wheeler - dewitt equation by freezing out the degrees of freedom of gravity and matter , reducing the superspace to a minisuperspace where only a finite amount of degrees of freedom are still available .",
    "more precisely , we expand the spacelike metric , non - gravitational fields and their conjugate momenta in some complete set @xmath59 : @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63    a minisuperspace is the set of spacelike geometries and matter fields where all but a finite set of the @xmath64 and their corresponding @xmath65 are put identically to zero .    evidently , this procedure violate the uncertainty principle .",
    "however , we expect that the quantization of these minisuperspace models retains many of the qualitative features of the full quantum theory , which are easier to study in this simplified model . for more details on minisuperspace models ,",
    "@xcite .    in the case of homogeneous models , which describe quite accurately the primordial universe , the supermomentum constraint @xmath66 is identically zero , and the shift function @xmath67 can be set to zero in eq .",
    "( [ 303 ] ) without loosing any of the einstein s equations .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 303 ] ) is reduced to : @xmath68,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 represent the homogeneous degrees of freedom coming from @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the weeler - dewitt equation then reads @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the minisuperspace particularizations of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , where @xmath81 represents the potential terms coming from the matter degrees of freedom .",
    "equations of the type of eq .",
    "( [ hoqg1 ] ) are well defined mathematically and solvable .",
    "we will discuss and solve some minisuperspace examples in the sequence , but first we must agree on how to extract information from these solutions .",
    "as we have emphasized in the introduction , we need a new interpretation of quantum mechanics that can be applied consistently to the wave function of the universe , which should be a solution of the wheeler - dewitt eq .",
    "( [ 320 ] ) .    in 1957 ,",
    "hugh everett iii presented his ph.d . thesis _ on the foundations of quantum mechanics _ , after publishing it under the title _  relative state \" formulation of quantum mechanics _",
    "@xcite . in this article",
    "he asserts that his motivation was to construct a formulation of quantum theory which should be adequate to general relativity and cosmology .",
    "he was aware of the incompatibility of the collapse postulate of the copenhaguen interpretation with a quantum theory of everything .",
    "he then proposed that the collapse postulate is not necessary , that it is in fact a foreign and artificial concept which is not imposed by the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics . in fact , in a good measurement , the different branches in which the total wave function bifurcates , describing the quantum system and experimental apparatus pointing to one particular possible result of the measurement , do not interfere among each other .",
    "this bifurcation , with such properties happen for whatever complicate experimental apparatus the branch is describing ( apparata measuring other apparata , yielding consistent results among them in the branch , and so on ) , including observers .",
    "each branch looks like a world where a particular outcome of the measurement has been obtained and every happening afterwards is compatible with this fact .",
    "also , as the branches do not interfere , they can not be aware of what is happening in the other branches .",
    "hence it seems that each branch describes a sensible world where facts are present .",
    "these observations led everett to the following argumentation : _ from the view point of the theory , all elements of a superposition ( all  branches \" ) are  actual \" , none anymore  real \" than another .",
    "it is completely unnecessary to suppose that after an observation somehow one element of the final superposition is selected to be awarded with a mysterious quality called  reality \" and the others condemned to oblivion",
    ". we can be more charitable and allow the others to coexist - they wo nt cause any trouble anyway because all the separate elements of the superposition (  branches \" ) individually obey the wave equation with complete indifference to the presence or absence (  actuality \" or not ) of the other elements .",
    "_    the question concerning the meaning of the reality of these branches , whether they represent minds of the observer , worlds or universes is still under debate , but a crucial point in this theory is the following : if all possibilities are realized in nature , what is the sense to assign probabilities to one of the outcomes of a measurement ? or in other words , how to recover the born rule in this framework ?",
    "this question is also under debate , with no final answer yet .",
    "hence the born measure of the worlds is a postulate of the mw theory .",
    "note , however , that this theory does not need an external agent or classical world amended to the quantum system : the schrdinger evolution is always valid , facts are present in each world , no collapse is needed , and the theory can be applied to any physical system .      in the consistent histories interpretation , quantum mechanics is not viewed as a theory of many worlds , but as a theory of many histories .",
    "it was developed by griffiths and omns in order to get a consistent interpretation of quantum mechanics without the problems mentioned above .",
    "the first basic assumption of this scheme is that , according to omns @xcite , ` every physical system , whether an atom or a star , is assumed to be described by a universal kind of mechanics , which is quantum mechanics ' .",
    "there are two immediate important consequences of this assumption : first that the theory deals with individual systems ( there is no sense in dealing with an ensemble of planets mars in order to study this planet ) , and second that classical mechanics must be derived from quantum mechanics in the situations where it is a good approximation . here , classical mechanics means not only classical dynamics ( newton s laws , in the non - relativistic case ) but also classical logic ( common sense ) , determinism , and everything characteristic of the classical world .",
    "therefore , the classical world must be derived from the quantum world .",
    "evidently , this kind of interpretation is better suited for quantum cosmology than the copenhaguen one .",
    "that is why hartle and gell - mann have developed an analogous framework in order to apply it to quantum cosmology .    in the history interpretation ,",
    "probabilities are not assigned to events as in usual quantum mechanics , but to whole histories . however , as we know , we can not assign probabilities to every history in quantum mechanics . the interference figure obtained from the two slit experiment",
    "is an evidence of this fact .",
    "hence , we must establish what are the conditions on families of histories in order to be possible to assign probabilities to all members of such families .",
    "once we obtain these conditions , we will have the possibility of saying , for instance , that a history of the universe with inflation is more probable than another one without inflation , without mentioning observers or measurements .",
    "let us give more details on how this interpretation works .",
    "a history of an isolated physical system is a succession of properties of this system occurring at different times .",
    "an example of a property of a system is the sentence ` the eigenvalue of the observable @xmath82 is in the set @xmath83 ' . to each property",
    "is associated a projector operator . in the above example , it would be the projector @xmath84 onto the subspace of the hilbert space containing all eigenvectors with eigenvalues in the set @xmath83 . another way to say",
    "the above property is ` the value of p is 1 ' .",
    "the probability of a property , designed by its projector @xmath84 , must satisfy the following conditions : @xmath85 where @xmath84 and @xmath86 are projectors into disjoint sets @xmath83 and @xmath87 .",
    "there is a theorem due to gleason @xcite , which shows that there exists a trace - class ( with unit trace ) positive operator @xmath88 ( the density operator ) , where a @xmath89 satisfying the above conditions can be written as : @xmath90    the probability of a history can also be obtained from some logical conditions ( for details , see ref .",

    "the existence of a measure is not crucial because the dbb quantum theory is not essentially probabilistic , as discussed in section 3 : the bohmian trajectories can be calculated without recurring to any probabilistic notion",
    ". then we can see whether these trajectories are singular or not .",
    "a comparison between the predictions of both quantum theories concerning the existence of singularities can be made only when a measure can be naturally postulated in the mw framework in the full quantum regime .",
    "we will focus on the situation already discussed in section 4 where a time variable can be defined when matter is described by a perfect hydrodynamical fluid , and one naturally obtains a schrdinger - like equation with its natural born measure .",
    "a mw interpretation for this kind of system was first discussed in ref .",
    "note , however , that in the case of a perfect fluid with extra degrees of freedom , problems of unitarity can appear , as discussed in the preceding section , and the mw theory can not be used in these cases either .    in this subsection",
    "we will discuss what kind of information one can extract from a given quantum state of the universe in the framework of the dbb and mw theories in the above - mentioned situations where both theories can be used .",
    "we will show that both approaches ( dbb and mw ) lead to the same time evolution of bohmian trajectories and mean values , respectively , when the kinetic term of the hamiltonian constraint is quadratic in the momenta and the eigenvalues of its metric have all the same sign .",
    "this assure that the evolution of the quantum state is unitary .",
    "however , the meaning of the mw mean values is quite problematic in quantum cosmology . we will discuss this issue in the following .",
    "as we have shown in section 4 , the schrdinger - like equation for quantum cosmology with a perfect fluid reads , @xmath326 where @xmath327 and the resulting quantum state calculated in section 3 is given by ( [ psi1 t ] ) .",
    "the schrdinger eq .",
    "( [ eqs222 ] ) has a kinetic term with metric with definite signature ( it is one dimensional ) .",
    "hence the evolution is unitary and we can construct the usual schrdinger measure in order to evaluate expectation values in the framework of the many - worlds theory . due to the chosen factor",
    "ordering , the mean value of any operator @xmath328 can be computed using the prescription ( in the @xmath218 representation ) , @xmath329    in the case of the scale factor itself one gets @xmath330^\\frac{1}{3(1-\\omega)}.\\ ] ] as calculated in section 3 , the bohmian trajectory reads @xmath331^\\frac{1}{3(1-\\omega)}.\\ ] ]    the main difference of the two results is that the bohmian trajectory depends on the arbitrary constant @xmath332 , which is the value of the scale factor at the bounce , while the mean value does not .",
    "this is because the mean value can also be calculated in the dbb approach by integrating the ensemble of bohmian trajectories corresponding to each value of @xmath332 using the quantum state evaluated at the moment of the bounce as its probability distribution , @xmath333^\\frac{1}{3(1-\\omega ) } \\int_0^\\infty a_0^{1 - 3\\omega}\\psi^*(a_0,t=0)\\,a_0\\,\\psi(a_0,t=0)\\,da_0,\\ ] ] yielding the result ( [ atm ] ) .",
    "if one raises the question concerning the presence of an initial singularity , one can assert with certainty within the dbb theory that they are eliminated because there is no quantum bohmian trajectory which is singular .",
    "however , in the mw theory , we can not arrive at the same conclusion : the mean value is not singular , but there may exist worlds in which the scale factor vanishes . hence , although the dynamics looks like the same , the physical conclusions one can obtain from the two theories are rather different .",
    "in contrast to what have been shown in the present review , it has been claimed in some recent papers ( some few examples are refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the wheeler - dewitt approach to quantum cosmology does not solve the singularity problem of classical cosmology .",
    "this claim is usually based on calculations on a very simple model , namely , a free massless scalar field in friedmann models , one of the models discussed in section 4 , and the quantization program which was carried out on those papers is very particular : the wheeler - dewitt equation of these models is a klein - gordon like equation , and the procedure is to extract a square root of it and work in a single frequency sector .",
    "note that this is not mandatory , and there are other ways to deal with the klein - gordon equation working with the two frequency sectors with a well defined inner product , as it can be seen in refs .",
    "finally , most of these references do not identify which interpretation of quantum cosmology has been used .    in this subsection",
    ", we will focus on ref .",
    "@xcite , where the interpretation adopted was precisely defined , the consistent histories approach , and the conclusion was that , if one takes family of histories with properties defined in just two moments of time , the infinity past and the infinity future , then the probability of a quantum bounce is null for any state . this was a remarkable result , in contradiction with the results presented in section 4 and in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the dbb quantum theory was used .",
    "our aim here is to discuss the results of ref .",
    "@xcite with care , and contextualize it in the framework of the de  broglie - bohm theory , and other quantization techniques , as the two frequencies ( klein - gordon ) approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to understand this discrepancy of results .",
    "we will first show that , in the single frequency approach using the consistent histories interpretation , families of histories containing properties defined in one or more moments of time , besides properties defined in the infinity past and in the infinity future , are no longer consistent , unless one takes semi - classical states , which of course corresponds to histories without a bounce .",
    "this means that in the framework of these families of histories one can not answer whether quantum bounces take place because histories involving any genuine quantum states are inconsistent .",
    "hence , the consistent histories approach is silent about quantum bounces happening in family of histories with more than two moments of time .",
    "furthermore , we will show that in the induced klein - gordon approach , there are no consistent family of histories involving genuine quantum states .",
    "again , the question about the existence of quantum bounces has no meaning in the induced klein - gordon approach .    on the contrary , if one considers the de broglie - bohm theory , where trajectories in configuration space are considered to be objectively real , one can show that in the two quantization procedures mentioned above , there exist plenty of non - singular bouncing trajectories which goes to the classical cosmological trajectories when the volume of the universe is big .",
    "hence , the existence of quantum bounces in the wheeler - dewitt approach depends strongly on the quantum interpretation one is adopting , and on the quantization procedure one is taking . in the end of this subsection",
    "we will discuss the physical reasons and consequences of this discrepancy .",

    "another investigation concerns the presence of a cosmological constant on such models .",
    "as we have seen , in bouncing models without a cosmological constant , vacuum initial conditions for quantum cosmological perturbations are set in the far past of the contracting phase , when the universe was very big and almost flat , justifying the choice of an adiabatic minkowski vacuum in that phase .",
    "however , if a cosmological constant is present , the asymptotic past of bouncing models will approach de sitter rather than minkowski spacetime .",
    "furthermore , the large wavelengths today become comparable with the hubble radius in the contracting phase when the universe was still slightly influenced by the cosmological constant .",
    "hence , the existence of a cosmological constant can modify the spectrum and amplitude of cosmological perturbations .",
    "note that this is not a question for inflation because initial conditions for quantum perturbations and the moment of hubble radius crossing in such models take place when the cosmological constant is completely irrelevant .",
    "the main difference is originated from processes much before the bounce , when the initial conditions are set and the cosmological constant is relevant . in that case",
    ", a minkowski adiabatic vacuum can only be defined in a precise time domain , i.e. , at the end of cosmological constant domination , but when the universe was still very big and rarefied . however , even in this time domain , as the length scale associated with the cosmological constant , given by the present acceleration of the universe , is not much bigger than the long wavelengths of physical interest today , the spectrum of these scales can still be slightly affected by the cosmological constant .",
    "and indeed we have shown @xcite , analytically and numerically , that the usual result for bouncing models , namely , that the fluid should satisfy @xmath690 in order to have an almost scale invariant spectrum of long wavelength perturbations , still holds , but the presence of the cosmological constant induces small oscillations and a small running towards a red - tilted spectrum for these scales .",
    "this may lead to small oscillations in the spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation at large scales superimposed to the usual acoustic oscillations .",
    "note that all these results were only possible to obtain because we have a scale factor function defined even at the quantum bounce due to the de broglie - bohm prescription given by guidance relations .",
    "because of that , the evolution of scalar and tensor perturbations through the quantum bounce is then smooth and suitable for analytical and numerical calculations .     in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "the solid line indicates the result obtained using @xmath691 , the dashed line for @xmath692 and the dotted line for @xmath693 .",
    "note that the oscillations become smaller for smaller @xmath694 , showing that they are due to the presence of the cosmological constant . ]    in order to complete this section related to cosmological perturbations , the dbb quantum theory can also be very useful already at the semi - classical level in order to explain the quantum to classical transition of quantum cosmological perturbations propagating in a standard classical cosmological model with inflation .",
    "this transition from quantum to classical fluctuations is plagued with important conceptual issues , most of them related to the application of standard quantum theory to the universe as a whole .",
    "in fact , there is no satisfactory justification on why the initial quantum vacuum state of the perturbations , which is translational and rotational invariant , and which remains so during schrdinger time evolution , results in a non - translational invariant state characteristic of our inhomogeneous universe . in particular , even when there is suitable decoherence , which suppresses interference between different non - invariant terms into which the quantum state can be decomposed , it is not explained why one of these terms is selected . according to standard quantum theory , a transition to a non - invariant state",
    "could only be obtained by collapse .",
    "for instance , in a spherically symmetric @xmath196-wave decay state of an atom , there are actual photons which are detected in particular directions .",
    "this happens because the detection involves a classical apparatus , a separate entity outside the quantum system which is not described by the wave function , and which brings to actual facts the potentialities inscribed in the @xmath196-wave .",
    "once the system reaches the classical apparatus , one can invoke the collapse postulate , which will yield a definite direction where the photon is detected . in the cosmological context , however , there is something qualitative new : here we are talking about cosmological primordial fluctuations , that is , fluctuations which will give rise to all structures in the universe .",
    "hence , in the cosmological case , there is no classical apparatus outside the quantum system , the quantum fluctuations should themselves generate all the structures , including inhomogeneous classical systems and possible classical apparata .",
    "however , as said above , the wave function of the perturbations is always translational and rotational invariant , so how these symmetries can be broken without an external agent , like in the @xmath196-wave example ? on the other hand , how can intrinsically inhomogeneous classical apparata exist without prior braking of these symmetries of the wave function ?",
    "these issues can easily be overcome in the framework of the de broglie - bohm quantum theory .",
    "as we have seen , in this theory the universe is described by a universal wave function , together with an actual configuration for gravity ( e.g.  an actual three metric ) and a configuration for the matter ( e.g.  particle positions or fields ) .",
    "this assumption , namely , the existence of an actual gravity - matter trajectory in configuration space , is the essential point of the dbb theory which breaks the translational and rotational invariance of the quantum system , in spite of the fact that the universal wave function always respects these symmetries , because in the dbb approach the wave function is not enough to describe the quantum physical system . hence ,",
    "although the quantum state remains translational and rotational invariant in this framework , the actual dbb field configuration corresponding to the perturbations breaks this symmetry .",
    "for example , in the simpler case of the @xmath196-wave decay of an atom , one can incorporate the apparatus in the quantum description ( it is not anymore a separate classical entity ) , and a particular photon detection happens because there is a particular atom - photon - apparatus configuration which is actually taking place , guided by the wave function .",
    "in addition , the dbb theory allows for a simple and unambiguous characterization of the classical limit .    in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite this quantum to classical transition was described with details from the dbb perspective .",
    "we have shown that , assuming a quantum vacuum state for the perturbations , the bohmian trajectories for each perturbation mode are non - classical while they are smaller than the hubble radius in the beginning of inflation , and then become classical when they get bigger than the hubble radius afterwards .",
    "hence , once again , the assumption of the objective reality of quantum trajectories turns out to be very useful in order to deal with cosmological issues .",
    "in this paper we reviewed the main results of the application of the dbb quantum theory to quantum cosmology .",
    "it is a consensus that in this domain we can not interpret the wave function of the universe using the copenhaguen interpretation .",
    "fortunately there are alternatives , like the mw theory , the ch interpretation , and the dbb theory . among these alternatives ,",
    "the dbb theory has one advantage over the others : the notion of a probability measure is not essential for obtaining results from the theory .",
    "in fact , it is a dynamical theory of trajectories in the configuration space of any general system , including the universe .",
    "this dynamical theory is , of course , not simple ( non - local , contextual ) and weird ( quantum mechanics is weird ) , where trajectories in configuration space are determined by a wave function satisfying the wave equation appropriate to the system under investigation .",
    "hence , one can use the resulting trajectories to answer physical questions about the system without needing any probabilistic notion .",
    "this is very important because quantum cosmology does not furnish an obvious probabilistic measure in general , which renders the implementation of alternative quantum theories rather obscure and involved .    in section 5 , we have shown explicitly that in de  broglie - bohm theory we can investigate the entire evolution of the universe , even without the notion of probability .",
    "it is worth remarking that every quantum model of the universe based on probabilistic outcomes has to face a non - trivial problem : we have only one copy of the system under investigation , the universe , which forbids us to repeat experiments , hence raising doubts about the physical meaning of any kind of probability in this context .",
    "thus , the lack of an obvious probabilistic measure which usually happens in quantum cosmology should not come as a surprise . on the contrary , this may be viewed as the rule of the game , pushing us to carefully analyze whether one can consistently extract information and predictions from such models without any notion of probability .",
    "we should stress that one can recover probabilistic predictions in quantum cosmology using the de broglie - bohm theory in the situations where they are necessary when one implements a more complex modeling of the universe , adding new degrees of freedom , like linear perturbations described in section 6 . in that case",
    ", a probability measure naturally appears in the quantum description of the sub - systems of the universe ( see section 6 for details ) , and the usual born rule can be recovered . in that case , for the sub - systems , the de broglie - bohm approach should coincide with other quantum theories .    we have also shown very precisely , under the perspective of this quantum theory , how to obtain the cosmological classical limit , how singularities can be avoided , and how the notion of time and probabilities can be recovered in the circumstances they are crucial .",
    "in fact , the simple assumption of the objective reality of trajectories in configuration space turns all these results possible .",
    "for instance , the dbb quantum theory yields simple explanations to old issues , like the quantum to classical transition of cosmological perturbations in the standard cosmological model , which are not so easy to obtain in other quantum theories @xcite .    in the case of full superspace ,",
    "the dbb interpretation of canonical quantum cosmology yields a quantum geometrodynamical picture where the bohmian quantum evolution of three - geometries may form , depending on the wave functional , a consistent non degenerate four geometry which must be euclidean ( but only for a very special local form of the quantum potential ) , or a consistent but degenerate four - geometry , indicating the presence of special vector fields and the breaking of the spacetime structure as a single entity .",
    "hence , in general , and always when the quantum potential is non - local , the three - geometries evolved under the influence of a quantum potential do not in general stick together to form a non degenerate four - geometry , a single spacetime with the causal structure of relativity . among the consistent bohmian evolutions ,",
    "the more general structures that are formed are degenerate four - geometries with alternative causal structures .",
    "we obtained these results taking a minimally coupled scalar field as the matter source of gravitation , but it can be generalized to any matter source with non - derivative couplings with the metric , like yang - mills fields .",
    "we have also seen that any real solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation yields a structure which is the idealization of the strong gravity limit of gr .",
    "due to the generality of this picture ( it is valid for any real solution of the wheeler - dewitt equation , which is a real equation ) , it deserves further attention",
    ". it may well be that these degenerate four - metrics are the correct quantum geometrodynamical description of the planckian universe .",
    "we would like to remark that all these results were obtained without assuming any particular factor ordering and regularization of the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "also , we did not use any probabilistic interpretation of the solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "hence , it is a quite general result .",
    "of course these conclusions are limited by many strong assumptions we have tacitly made , as supposing that a continuous three - geometry exists at the quantum level ( quantum effects could also destroy it ) , or the validity of quantization of standard gr , forgetting other developments like string theory .",
    "however , even if this approach is not the appropriate one , it is nice to see how far we can go with the dbb quantum theory , even in such incomplete stage of canonical quantum gravity .",
    "one may object that the conclusions based on the dbb theory may have no physical significance , that they are abstractions with no observational consequences .",
    "however , in our section 6 we have shown that the hypothesis of the objective reality of quantum bohmian trajectories in configuration space may lead to peculiar observational consequences related to the evolution of quantum cosmological perturbations in quantum cosmological backgrounds , which might be tested and which are not known how to be obtained in other approaches . note that if one had used other interpretations of quantum mechanics instead of dbb theory , where the notion of trajectories is not immediate , the implementation of the calculations for the perturbations we have presented in section 6 based , e.g. , on eq .",
    "( [ equacoes - mukhanov ] ) could have been much more involved , if possible .",
    "also , if the simplifications discussed just before eq .  ( [ equacoes - mukhanov ] ) had not been made , corrections to the schrdinger equation for the perturbations in the quantum background could have led to a departure from quantum equilibrium during the bounce , turning possible to find physical systems , which were created and frozen after the bounce , were the dbb theory could be tested against usual quantum theory because they would not satisfy the born rule .",
    "we are presently in a situation in quantum physics where we have a precise algorithm that furnish correct probabilistic predictions concerning all known quantum phenomena , but with no underlying consensual theoretical understanding of this algorithm .",
    "there are many proposals , each one with their own merits and difficulties , which furnish the same known experimental results .",
    "the universe is a very peculiar physical system , where quantum concepts are pushed to their limits .",
    "we have seen , for instance , that the theoretical framework of the copenhagen interpretation simply can not be applied to quantum cosmology , and that some conclusions about the existence of cosmological singularities may depend strongly on the quantum theory we are using .",
    "hence , quantum cosmology can be viewed as the arena on which one may select the quantum theory , among the many viable present possibilities , which is the most suitable to describe all quantum phenomena , including the universe itself . if it turns out that one or more of the results obtained in section 6 within the framework of the dbb theory applied to quantum cosmology are indeed observed and confirmed in the future , with no alternative classical explanation for them , then we will have a situation where a particular quantum theory is capable to predict and describe some physical phenomena which are not known how to be obtained in other quantum theories .",
    "hence , we will face the situation where not only quantum theory is helping cosmology but also cosmology is helping quantum theory .",
    "these are exciting possibilities that must be investigated in the future , not only because they are relevant for cosmology , but also because they are important for quantum physics itself .                                                                                                      c. kiefer , class",
