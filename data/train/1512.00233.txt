    "pyrochlores with chemical formula a@xmath0b@xmath0o@xmath1 ( a and b generally stands for rare earth and transition metal ions , respectively ) have attracted surge of scientific interest over last one or two decades @xcite .",
    "these materials have in - built frustration arising from structural geometry where the a and b cations form corner - shared tetrahedra . as a result , many interesting physical phenomena are observed .",
    "most notable examples are spin glass @xcite , spin ice @xcite , spin liquid @xcite , anomalous hall effect @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , kondo - like behavior @xcite , etc .    in recent times , ir - based pyrochlores ( a@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 )",
    "have been at center place for investigation .",
    "in addition to its geometric frustration , these materials exhibit sizable spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) effect due to presence of heavy ir atoms .",
    "however , the electron - electron correlation effect ( @xmath4 ) , which is usually prominent in transition metal oxides , turns out relatively small in these systems due to extended character of 5@xmath5 orbitals of ir .",
    "nonetheless , the soc and electronic correlation effect exhibit comparable energy scale , therefore , these ir - based oxides systems offer an ideal playground where the interesting physics coming out as an interplay between these two effects can be studied with control manner .",
    "the theoretical calculation , indeed , has predicted various exotic topological insulating phases in pyrochlore iridates based on this intriguing interplay between soc and electronic correlation effect @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent study has shown that physical properties in pyrochlore iridates a@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 largely depend on ionic radius of @xmath6 where the material gradually shifts from its insulating / magnetic behavior to metallic / nonmagnetic one with increasing ionic radius @xcite .    within the family of pyrochlore iridates",
    ", the y@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 has special interest as it has nonmagnetic y@xmath7 residing at a - site therefore , the magnetic properties are mostly determined by the contribution from ir sublattice .",
    "in addition , one can exclude the possibility of @xmath8-@xmath5 exchange interactions which has been discussed to introduce complicated magnetic interactions in ir - based pyrochlores @xcite .",
    "this is also important considering obvious interconnection between magnetic and electronic properties in these materials .",
    "this shows y@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 is an ideal system to study the intercoupling effect of soc and @xmath4 while neglecting other associated contributions .",
    "this material by nature is insulator where the resistivity increases by couple of orders at low temperature @xcite .",
    "the magnetic state is , however , still debated .",
    "while the neutron diffraction / scattering measurements reveal no sign of magnetic long - range ordering @xcite , the muon spin rotation / relaxation measurement @xcite , on the other hand , has shown well - defined spontaneous oscillations in muon symmetry indicating long - range ordering . considering the in - built frustration in pyrochlore lattice ,",
    "the glass - like behavior could also be a low temperature magnetic state in y@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "note , that y - based other pyrochlores i.e. , y@xmath0mo@xmath0o@xmath1 , y@xmath0ru@xmath0o@xmath1 have shown spin - glass behavior @xcite .",
    "this underlines the fact that there is need for conclusive understanding of magnetic state in y@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 which is further amplified with the fact that recent calculation proposes topological weyl semimetallic phase in y@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 based on its ground state magnetic character @xcite .",
    "in this work , we present detailed structural , magnetic , thermodynamic and transport properties of pyrochlore iridate y@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "magnetic measurements show onset of magnetic irreversibility at temperature @xmath2 @xmath3 160 k , however , no sharp peak / cusp is observed at this temperature .",
    "analysis of magnetization data shows no spontaneous moment at low temperature . instead , reasonable magnetic relaxation and aging behavior similar to metamagnetic systems such as , spin - glasse , superparamagnet has been observed .",
    "temperature dependent x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurements show there is no crystallographic phase / symmetry transition down to low temperature .",
    "the material is found to be insulating throughout the temperature range where the resistivity follows power law behavior with temperature .",
    "the negative magnetoresistance at low temperature can be explained with quantum interference effect .",
    "polycrystalline samples of y@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 have been prepared using standard solid state method .",
    "the ingredient powder materials y@xmath0o@xmath9 and iro@xmath0 with phase purity @xmath10 99.99% ( sigma - aldrich ) are taken in stoichiometric ratio .",
    "the mixture are ground well , subsequently pelletized and heated in air at 1000@xmath11c for 96 hours , at 1100@xmath11c for 96 hours and at 1160@xmath11c for 252 hours with intermediate grinding .",
    "the heating and cooling rate has been used 3@xmath11c / min .",
    "the material has been characterized by powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) using a rigaku made diffractometer ( model : miniflex600 ) with cuk@xmath12 radiation at room temperature .",
    "the xrd data have also been collected at different temperatures in the range of 300 - 20 k using a panalytical xpert powder diffractomer .",
    "the low temperature is achieved using a helium close cycle refregerator ( ccr ) based cold head where proper temperature stabilization is ensured by waiting sufficiently before collecting data .",
    "data have been collected in the range of 2@xmath13 = 10 - 90@xmath11 with a step of @xmath14 = 0.033@xmath11 and scan rate of 2@xmath11/min .",
    "the collected xrd data have been analyzed using reitveld refinement program ( fullprof ) by young _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the rietveld analysis shows the material is in single phase except presence of small fraction of unreacted ingredient materials .",
    "it can be noted that after certain heat treatment , no further improvement in terms of unreacted ingredients is observed , rather they are found to grow .",
    "magnetically , the y@xmath0o@xmath9 is diamagnetic and iro@xmath0 is paramagnetic therefore , these residual impurities are expected to influence the magnetic properties of desired material minimally .",
    "note , that similar impurity phases have also been observed in previous studies @xcite .",
    "in general , pyrochlore materials adopt cubic crystallographic phase with _",
    "m _ symmetry @xcite .",
    "there are two sets of oxygen atoms , therefore pyrochlore structures consist of four nonequivalent crystallographic positions ( table i ) . the resulting composition can be written as y@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath16o@xmath17 .",
    "the ir@xmath18 cations are six coordinated and they form corner shared iro@xmath16 octahedra with equal length ( @xmath19 ) of ir - o bonds . the eight coordinated ( six o and two o@xmath17 ) y@xmath7 cations form distorted cubes where y - o bonds are equal in length and larger than the y - o@xmath17 ones .",
    "the only variable position in pyrochlore structures is @xmath20 position with o ( table i ) which determines its structural stability .",
    "for instance , @xmath20 = 0.3125 gives perfect iro@xmath16 octahedra while @xmath20 = 0.375 results in perfect cubes around y. the pyrochlore structure can be viewed as interpenetrating two sub - lattices consists of each type of tetrahedra i.e. , y@xmath21o@xmath17 and ir@xmath21@xmath22 , where @xmath22 implies empty center - site ( 8a site ) .",
    "as these tetrahedra s are corner shared so the magnetic atoms sitting at vertices of tetrahedra induces frustration .",
    "the rietveld analysis of our xrd data confirms that y@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 crystallizes in cubic phase with _",
    "m _ symmetry ( fig .",
    "the unit cell lattice parameter is found to be @xmath23 = 10.2445  .",

    "the bond lengths and bond angels for present materials ( table ii ) shows good agreement with the reported values @xcite .",
    "dc magnetization data have been collected using a vibrating sample magnetometer ( ppms , quantum design ) , specific heat have been measured following semi - adiabatic method and electrical transport properties have been measured using a home - built insert fitted with oxford superconducting magnet .",
    "ir@xmath0o@xmath1 is shown at room temperature along with rietveld analysis.,width=302 ]",
    "magnetization as a function of temperature has been measured following zero field cooled ( zfc ) and field cooled ( fc ) protocol after applying magnetic field of 1 koe .",
    "2 shows with decreasing temperature , @xmath26 increases , however , there are two observations : around 160 k there is change in slope in data and below around 50 k the magnetization increases very sharply .",
    "the corresponding @xmath27 shows identical nature of @xmath26 till around 160 k , and below this temperature a bifurcation is observed between both branches of magnetization .",
    "the onset of this irreversibility between zfc and fc magnetization is at temperature @xmath2 @xmath3 160 k. some disagreement has earlier been observed about the value of @xmath2 . while the majority of studies@xcite have shown the @xmath2 in the range of 150 - 160 k accompanied by a feeble kink in @xmath28 around @xmath2 , the another study by disseler _",
    "@xcite shows a higher @xmath2 ( 190 k ) and cusp in @xmath28 at @xmath2 .",
    "our observed @xmath2 @xmath3 160 k agrees well with the majority of studies .",
    "as discussed , the nature of magnetic phase below @xmath2 for this material is debated as both presence as well as absence of long - range ordering has been discussed @xcite . nonetheless , the bifurcation around @xmath2 in fig .",
    "2 is suggestive of spin ordering related to long - range or short - range type spin ordering or even spin - glass like freezing .",
    "the cusp in magnetic susceptibility , which generally signifies the onset of magnetic ordering , is notably absent in fig .",
    "this similar absence of peak has been observed in other studies as well@xcite .",
    "this qualitatively suggests magnetic frustration is quite significant in this material which perhaps prevent the long - range type magnetic ordering .",
    "data are collected following zfc and fc protocol .",

    "2 , we show temperature variation of inverse susceptibility ( @xmath29 ) which is deduced from zfc magnetization data @xmath31 measured in 10 koe magnetic field . as evident , above @xmath2 , the @xmath32 shows a linear behavior over a wide temperature range .",
    "the @xmath32 has been fitted to modified curie - weiss ( cw ) behavior @xmath33 = @xmath34 = @xmath35 + @xmath36 , where @xmath35 is the temperature independent susceptibility , @xmath37 is the curie constant and @xmath38 is the curie temperature .",
    "the inset of figure shows fitting of data as represented by solid line in temperature regime between 200 - 300 k. the obtained fitted parameters are @xmath35 = 1.9 @xmath39 10@xmath40 emu / mole , @xmath37 = 1.4 emu k / mole and @xmath38 = -386 k. the sign as well as magnitude of @xmath38 imply a reasonably strong non - ferromagnetic type magnetic interaction .",
    "moreover , the obtained @xmath37 corresponds to effective paramagnetic moment , @xmath41 = 3.35 @xmath42/f.u .",
    "the estimated @xmath41 appears higher than the expected value ( @xmath43 ) which turns out to be 1.73 @xmath42/f.u in case of spin - only value ( @xmath44 = 2 and @xmath45 = 1/2 ) .",
    "these pyrochlore compounds are inherently frustrated due to their geometrical configuration which often lead to exotic magnetic ground state such as , spin liquid , spin ice , spin glass , etc .",
    "the relevant frustration parameter ( @xmath8 ) , which is conventionally defined as ratio @xmath46/@xmath47 , where @xmath47 is the ordering or spin freezing temperature , has been calculated to be @xmath3 2.4 taking @xmath47 = 160 k. this @xmath8 value in present material is significant though much lower than the value ( @xmath10 100 ) usually seen for highly frustrated spin - liquid compounds as in pr@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "this clearly shows absence of spontaneous magnetization viz - a - viz fm ordering in present y@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 material .",
    "this finding is important because long - range type antiferromagnet with non - collinear spin ordering ( i.e. , all - in / all - out type ) would exhibit a weak ferromagnetic behavior which will also be manifested in arrott plot similar to sr@xmath0iro@xmath21 @xcite .",
