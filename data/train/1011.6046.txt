    "based on experimental results , a considerable part of the total decay rate of the @xmath4 meson is related to its decay to @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 is a proper meson to study the phenomenology of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons and their structures . due to charm quark",
    ", this meson plays an essential role in analyzing of the weak and strong interactions as well as exploring new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) which will be probed by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the charmed systems are known for very small cp violations in the sm , hence any detection of cp violations in such systems can be considered as a signal for presence of new physics ( for more information about the @xmath4 meson and its decays see @xcite ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyze the semileptonic @xmath5 decays in the framework of light cone qcd sum rules ( lcsr ) .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons are mixing states @xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is single mixing angle .",
    "the measured values of @xmath7 in the the quark flavor ( qf ) basis ( for more information about this basis see for instance @xcite ) are @xmath8 and @xmath9 with and without the gluonium content for @xmath2 , respectively @xcite . the mixing angle @xmath7 has also been obtained as @xmath10^{\\circ}$ ] by recently measured @xmath11 $ ] in light - front quark model @xcite .",

    "( [ wavefns ] ) and ( [ param0 ] ) were calculated at the renormalization scale @xmath84 using qcd sum rules and are given as @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the values of the other input parameters appearing in sum rules for form factors are : qauark masses at the scale of about @xmath90 @xmath91 , @xmath92 @xcite , meson masses @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 @xcite and @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "the sum rules for form factors also contain two auxiliary parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath77 .",
    "the continuum threshold is not totally arbitrary but it depends on the energy of the first excited state .",
    "we choose , @xmath98 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "now , we are looking for a working region for @xmath77 , where according to sum rules philosophy , our numerical results be stable for a given continuum threshold @xmath42 .",
    "the working region for the borel mass parameter is determined requiring that not only contributions of the higher states and continuum effectively suppress , but also contributions of the da s with higher twists are small .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that the suitable region is : @xmath99 .",
    "the dependence of the form factors @xmath73 and @xmath100 on @xmath77 are shown in fig .",

    "( 160,30 ) ( 0,-20 )    this figure shows that the form factors weakly depend on the borel mass parameter in its working region .",
    "now , we proceed to find the @xmath101 dependence of the form factors .",
    "it should be stressed that in the region , @xmath102 the applicability of the lcsr is problematic . in order to extend our results to the whole physical region , we look for a parametrization of the form factors such that in the region , @xmath103 , the results obtained from the above  mentioned parametrization coincide well with the light cone qcd sum rules predictions .",
    "the most simple parametrization of the @xmath101 dependence of the form factors is expressed in terms of three parameters in the following form : @xmath104 where , @xmath105 .",
    "the values of the parameters , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are given in table [ t31 ] .",
    "this table also contains predictions of the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) for @xmath108 for two sets ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the errors presented in this table are due to variation of the continuum threshold @xmath42 , variation of the borel parameter @xmath77 , and uncertainties coming from the da s and other input parameters .",
