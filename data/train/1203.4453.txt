    "when @xmath153 , a phase transition can occur in a magnetic field .",
    "at zero magnetic field the ordered moment @xmath154 lies in the @xmath151 plane . with increasing magnetic field ,",

    "the @xmath151 component of the ordered moment @xmath154 gives the order parameter .    in the molecular field",

    "( [ eq : model ] ) , and that the magnetic ordering of the spin model is equivalent to the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of the lattice bosons .",
    "the magnetization is related to the density of the bosons @xmath164 as @xmath165 , and the magnetic field corresponds to the chemical potential of the bosons . because the density of the bosons is larger than @xmath9 at a finite magnetic field , it is convenient to consider the holes instead of the bosons .",
    "the density of the holes @xmath166 is related to the magnetization as @xmath167 .",
    "the density of the holes exhibits a cusplike minimum at @xmath160 because the magnetization has a cusplike maximum .",
    "the cusplike minimum of the density at the bec transition is characteristic of interacting dilute bosons at a constant chemical potential.@xcite the temperature dependence of the density of the holes is explained as follows : above the bec transition temperature @xmath160 , the number of thermally excited holes decreases with decreasing temperature . at @xmath160 ,",
    "the bec of holes occurs and the number of condensed holes increases below @xmath160 with decreasing temperature .",
    "the increase in the number of condensed holes surpasses the decrease in the number of thermally excited holes.@xcite for this reason , the density of holes has a minimum at @xmath160 , which leads to the cusplike maximum of the magnetization .",
    "the temperature dependence of the magnetization observed at a low magnetic field for @xmath8 is understandable in terms of the temperature variation of the density of lattice bosons .",
    "we have reported the results of magnetization and specific heat measurements on cs@xmath0cu@xmath1cef@xmath2 , which is magnetically described as a spin-@xmath9 spatially anisotropic stacked kagome - lattice antiferromagnet . from the experimental results and their analyses , we found the following . owing to its strongly spatially anisotropic kagome lattice , cs@xmath0cu@xmath1cef@xmath2 can be subdivided into alternating - exchange chains and dangling spins .",
    "the dangling spins are further divided into two subsystems ds1 and ds2 .",
    "the dangling spins in ds1 undergo ferromagnetic ordering at 3.14 k at zero magnetic field , while those in ds2 remain paramagnetic down to 0.35 k. it is considered that he ferromagnetic ordering of the dangling spins in ds1 arises from the effective 3d ferromagnetic exchange interaction mediated by the chain spins .",
    "this effective exchange interaction is expressed by the @xmath5 model with the easy - axis anisotropy , where the @xmath6 direction is parallel to the crystallographic @xmath7 axis . for @xmath168 ,",
    "this model is equivalent to the system of interacting lattice bosons.@xcite the magnetic ordering in cs@xmath0cu@xmath1cef@xmath2 for @xmath8 can be defined even in magnetic fields . within the molecular field approximation to the @xmath5 model ,",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the ordering temperature of the dangling spins in ds1 observed for @xmath8 can be explained , while the cusplike maximum magnetization at the transition temperature can not be explained .",
