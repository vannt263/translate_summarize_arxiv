    "ribonucleic acid ( rna ) is now known to be involved in many biological processes , such as carriers of genetic information ( messenger rnas ) , simple adapters of amino acids ( transfer rnas ) , and enzymes catalyzing the reactions in protein synthesis , cleavage and synthesis of phosphodiester bonds @xcite . in particular , recent discoveries indicated that a class of rna called small rna operates many of cell s control ( for a report , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these diverse and specific biological functions of rna are guided by their unique three - dimensional folding .",
    "therefore , prediction or measurements of rna folding and folding dynamics becomes one of central problems in biological studies .",
    "in addition to standard experimental methods such as x - ray crystallograph and nmr spectroscopy , single - molecule manipulation technique developed in the past decade provides a fresh and promising way in resolving the rna folding problem @xcite . as a concrete example",
    ", an optical tweezer setup is sketched in fig .",

    ", the distance between the two beads and the force acting on the bead in the light trap can be measured with high resolution .",
    "this sophisticated setup has showed its abilities in recording the time - traces of the end - to - end distance of a small 22-basepair rna hairpin @xcite , and resolving complicated unfolding pathways of 1540-base long 16s ribosomal rna @xcite .    .",

    "the advent of the single - molecule experiments addresses a challenging issue for theorists : whether or how can we apply the known secondary structural rna knowledge to explain or predict the phenomena observed in the single - molecule experiments ?",
    "under force stretching or twisting , the elastic properties which were cared little or even neglected before now must be seriously took into account .",
    "many theoretical efforts have been devoted to understand force unfolding rnas @xcite .",
    "however these theories or models are too simple to be applied in experiments ; useful free energy data about rna secondary structure obtained before were often neglected .",
    "moreover , they just studied equilibrium cases , while intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena were beyond their scopes .",
    "simulation method should be a good choice to overcome these shortcomings .",
    "but we noted that , compared to enormous simulation works about force unfolding proteins @xcite , the simulations for rnas are few @xcite though biological importance of the later is the same as the former . to fill this gap , our group developed stochastic methods and applied it to investigate the interesting force unfolding single rnas experiments @xcite . in this paper , we will summarize our previous effort and extend them to investigate more intriguing issue , the remarkable jarzynski s equality @xcite , which its experimental test has attracted consideralble attention .",
    "a rna sequence is denoted by a nucleotides string @xmath6 ; the bases @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the nucleotides at @xmath9 and @xmath10 end of the sequence , respectively .",
    "a secondary structure @xmath11 of a rna sequence is a list of base pairs @xmath12 $ ] that must satisfy two conditions : every base forms a pair with at most one other base , and if any two base pairs @xmath12 $ ] and @xmath13 $ ] are in the list , then @xmath14 implies @xmath15 .",
    "all structures of the sequence @xmath16 comprise a set , @xmath17 , here @xmath18 denotes the completely open chain conformation .    in order to describe the folding or unfolding process as a time - ordered series of the structures in",
    "the set @xmath19 , a relation @xmath20 which specifies whether two structures are accessible from each other by an elementary  move \" must be reasonably defined .",
    "the definition is identical to specifying a metric in the set @xmath19 .",
    "any secondary structure formation or dissolving hence can be described by a succession of elementary steps chosen according to some distributions from a pool of acceptable moves in the conformational space @xmath21 . in the absence of mechanical force , two kinds of move sets have been proposed in modelling secondary structural rna folding : one is the formation or decay of a single helix @xcite , and the other is the removal or insertion of single base pairs per time step @xcite .",
    "we make use of the latter , for it is the simplest move set on the level of secondary structure .",
    "moreover , we mainly focus on smaller rnas .",
    "the formation or removal of a helix may cause larger structural changes , while its physical relevance of rna folding or unfolding seems debatable .      according to the difference of the external controlled parameters ,",
    "the rna unfolding experiments can be carried out under constant extension and constant force , i.e. , the constant extension and the constant force ensembles  @xcite .",
    "we first consider the constant extension ensemble .",
    "[ figure1 ] is the sketch of an optical tweezer setup for this ensemble .",
    "the position of the center of the light trap is moved according to a time - dependent relationship @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the distance between the centers of the light trap and the bead held by the micropipette , @xmath24 is offset at time @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the constant velocity . we suppose that the changes of the extensions of rna and the handle proceed along one direction , and the physical effect of the beads is negligible .",
    "any state of the system at time @xmath0 then can be specified with three independent quantities , the extension of the rna @xmath4 , the end - to - end distance of the handle @xmath3 , and the rna secondary structure @xmath11 , i.e. , the system in @xmath27-state at time t @xmath28 .",
    "we do not include @xmath2 here for the sum of individual extensions satisfies the constraint condition , @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the unfolding of the single rna proceeds in an conformational space @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 and , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the contour lengths of the handle and the rna molecule , respectively . in order to describe this process as a time - ordered series of the conformations in the space , a relation @xmath20 which specifies whether two conformations are accessible from each other by an elementary  move \" ( or neighbors ) must be reasonably defined .",
    "we propose the following move set @xcite , @xmath34 the first kind of the moves is the removal or insertion of single base pairs while fixing the extensions @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the other two kinds are to respectively move the positions of the end of the handle and the end of single - stranded rna with a small displacement @xmath35 , while the secondary structure is fixed simultaneously .    given the system state @xmath27 at time t , the systematic energy can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the free energy obtained from folding the rna sequence into the secondary structure @xmath38 , and the elastic energies of the optical trap , the handle , and the single - stranded part of the rna are @xmath39 respectively , and @xmath40 . in the expression @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the average force of the handle at given extension @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the persistence length of double stranded handle . in the expression @xmath46",

    "note that @xmath53 is the inverse function of @xmath47 , and the contour length of the rna @xmath54 .",
    "the light trap here is simply assumed to be a harmonic potential with spring constant @xmath55 .",
    "hence the loading rate is @xmath56 .    in the real experiments ,",
    "constant force can be imposed on rna molecules with feedback - stabilized optical tweezers capable of maintaining a preset force by moving the beads closer or further apart . including the feedback mechanism in theoretical study is not essential now .",
    "therefore the energy of tweezer in eq .",
    "[ systematicenergy ] is replaced by @xmath57 .",
    "given the move sets and the unfolding conformational spaces , the rna unfolding for the two ensembles can be modelled as a markov process in their respective spaces .",
    "following conventional stochastic kinetics of chemical reactions , these processes are described as the master equation , @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the probability of the system being i - state at time t , and @xmath60 is the transition probability from i - state to j - state .",
    "the form of the master equation looks relatively simple , however it is mathematically intractable to solve analytically for simple  reaction \" system such as rna p5ab .",
    "previous work has demonstrated that a continuous time monte carlo simulation is an excellent approach toward the stochastic process described by eq .",
    "[ mastereq ] @xcite . as a variant of the standard monte carlo method , the _ continuous time monte carlo _ ( ctmc ) method is very efficient and fast because of lacking of waiting times due to rejection .",
    "in contrast to standard mc method , instead of the mc step used to approximate the real time , the  time \" in gillespie s method could be real if the transition probabilities were calculated by first principles or empirically .",
    "the key formula in ctmc is that , given the system at @xmath27-state at current time @xmath0 , the probability density @xmath61 that the next state is j and it occurs at time @xmath62 is @xmath63 where @xmath64 are transition probabilities from the i - state to the neighbouring @xmath65-state at time @xmath66 , which can be time - dependent or time - independent ( no parameters @xmath66 ) @xcite , and the sum is over all neighbors of @xmath27-state . according to eq .",
    "[ probability ] , then the time @xmath62 for the next state to occur can be obtained by solving the following equation , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a uniform random number in the interval [ 0,1 ] . for time - independent situation",
    ", the equation reduces to most common expression @xmath69 $ ] . while if the transition probabilities involve time @xmath0 , then numerical methods for integration and root finding have to be applied @xcite .",
    "then the next state @xmath70 is chosen if another uniform random number @xmath71 .",
    "we assume that the transition probabilities satisfy the symmetric rule @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 scales the time axis of the unfolding process from the experimental measurements .",
    "apparently , the transition probabilities satisfy the detailed balance condition .      if the moving velocity of the light trap vanishes , an exact partition function method can calculate the molecular average extension and the average force under the given distance @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the method is an extension of the partition function method proposed for rna secondary structural prediction @xcite .",
    "different from the experimental measurements of the free energy with slow pulling velocity ( quasi - equilibrium process ) @xcite , we obtain the equilibrium information by this exact method . considering coincidences of formulae and new physical quantities needed , we rewrite the formulae in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the key idea of the exact method is that the partition function over all secondary structures of a given rna can be calculated by dynamic programming @xcite . given the partition function @xmath75 on the sequence segment [ i , j ] with exterior bases @xmath76 , its recursion formula is as follows , @xmath77 where @xmath78 , the partition function @xmath79 on the sequence segment [ i , j ] for which the @xmath27 and @xmath70 bases are paired ; vienna package 1.4 provides the calculation codes @xcite .    for the constant extension ensemble ,",

    "it is not strange because we do not include the effect of ionic concentration in our model .",
    "hence we choose a reasonable ionic correction of rna free energies @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we still do not get good results ; see table i. there are tow possible causes leading to such discrepancies .",
    "one is that the ionic corrections or free energy parameters for rna are not precise enough ; they can not be used in the force unfolding cases .",
    "the other is that polymer elastic parameters are not very precise .",
    "we prefer to the later .",
    "in addition to rna free energy measured and tested for almost forty years , the persistent length of ssdna in ionic environment is still debatable @xcite .",
    "for instance , we calculate the unfolding forces of the three molecule with @xmath113 nm and indeed find that they are closer to the experimental values . as a further demonstration",

    "the extension versus time trajectories are used to reconstruct the free energy landscapes , compare the qualities of the three estimators , and investigate the estimators dependence on the trajectories number . for the constant force ensemble",
    ", we particularly studied the interesting extension - time traces dependence on force , which would be relevant to rna folding dynamics .",
    "the most advantage in study of force unfolding rnas is that the knowledge accumulated in the past forty years for rna secondary structure provides a solid fundament for theoretical predictions ( including kinetics and thermodynamics ) in practice .",
