    "our previous results concerning the bianchi type ix model @xcite show that the singularity of the classical theory may be replaced by a non - singular dynamics due to a consistent quantization of the gravitational field .",
    "the singularity resolution is issued from the quantization respecting the symmetries of the phase space .",
    "notably , we employed the so - called affine coherent states ( acs ) to define the quantization map .    if the range of canonical variables is the full plane , the phase space symmetry is translational , represented by the weyl - heisenberg group , and the quantization is canonical .",
    "this is the case for anisotropic variables , which describe aspherical deformations to the spatial geometry of the bianchi - ix model .",
    "thus , we quantize these variables following the usual canonical prescription . however , if the range of canonical variables is the half plane , the phase space symmetry is respected by dilation and translation , which generate the @xmath0 affine group of the real line .",
    "covariant quantization respecting this symmetry is obtained with the use of coherent states constructed via a unitary irreducible representation of the affine group .",
    "this is the case for isotropic variables , representing the volume and the mean expansion in the bianchi - ix model .",
    "we quantize these variables with acs . as a result , a quantum term , which regularizes the dynamics near the boundary of the phase space ,",
    "is issued .",
    "this term is responsible for resolving the singularity of the classical dynamics and replacing it by a bounce .    to solve the quantum dynamics for the mixmaster universe , we apply assumptions inspired by approaches in molecular physics @xcite . in our earlier papers",
    "@xcite we assumed the adiabatic dynamics and employed the born - huang - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "the anisotropic oscillations were approximated by a fixed quantum state during the evolution . in our recent paper @xcite we made a step beyond the adiabatic approximation and allowed for excitations and decays of the oscillations .",
    "the framework included however the assumption of no backreaction from the transitions between oscillatory states on the isotropic expansion .",
    "we were able to define and solve a unitary dynamics of the model within the harmonic approximation to the anisotropy potential .",
    "a parameter describing stiffness of the bounce in the isotropic variables was recognized crucial to the dynamical properties of the anisotropic oscillations .",
    "the adiabatic approximation was found to break down when this parameter exceeds its critical value .",
    "then a non - linear excitation of anisotropic eigenstates takes place throughout the bounce .",
    "the application of this result to a model of radiation - filled universe indicates a possibility of large production of anisotropy at the bounce which led to some sort of a sustained phase of accelerated expansion resembling the standard inflationary phase .",
    "this quasi - inflationary phase came as a result of our quantization method based on the adm canonical formalism and ordinary quantum mechanics , in contrast with inflationary models where an additional scalar field in a suitable potential is introduced .    in the present paper",
    "we develop a suitable framework to address the problem of the bounce followed by the quasi - inflationary phase in detail .",
    "it is called the vibronic framework and it accommodates the full evolution of the oscillatory degrees of freedom and their backreaction on the background dynamics .",
    "the background dynamics is given a semiclassical treatment by confining it to the space of coherent states .",
    "in the limit of large volumes , the semiclassical dynamics coincides with the classical one . like in our previous papers , we apply the harmonic approximation to the anisotropy potential .",
    "we arrive at a consistent set of equations , which include quantum and semiclassical degrees of freedom and which preserve the semiclassical constraint .",
    "we illustrate our framework with a numerical study of two examples of initial conditions .",
    "they confirm the possibility of stable friedmann - like adiabatic quantum dynamics as well as of the breakdown of adiabatic behavior .",
    "the application of the framework to physically plausible settings requires much more involved numerical computations and is postponed to future work .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ b9model ] is a reminder of the classical and quantum hamiltonian for the mixmaster universe .",
    "section [ appsclag ] extends klauder s approach to set up the semiclassical lagrangian framework for constrained systems with quantum internal degrees of freedom .",
    "section [ discframe ] is devoted to a discussion of various possible approximations for hamiltonians with internal degrees of freedom among which the born - oppenheimer approximation is the simplest one and the vibronic approach is the most elaborate one .",
    "section [ dyneq ] concerns the specification of the vibronic approximation to the mixmaster universe within the harmonic approximation .",
    "we derive a complete set of equations of motion and we discuss the modified friedmann equation . in section [ comdyneq ]",
    "we discuss various aspects of the employed formalism and derived from it equations of motion .",
    "we integrate numerically the derived equation of motion in section [ numsim ] where we confirm the stability of the adiabatic approximation to the solution with anisotropy in the ground state .",
    "we also find a weakening of the stability as the anisotropy eigennumber increases , which is with agreement with our result in @xcite .",
    "we conclude in section [ conclu ] where we discuss some physical implications of our present result and pose interesting questions to be examined in future papers .",
    "the mixmaster universe is a spatially homogenous model with the spatial killing vector fields satisfying @xmath1-algebra .",
    "it assumes the following metric : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the configuration variables , the @xmath6 s are right - invariant dual vectors satisfying @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the lapse function rescaled in order to simplify coefficients in the subsequent formulas .",

    "we follow the conventions of our previous papers @xcite .",

    "this potential possesses the @xmath18 symmetry and is asymptotically _ confining _ except for the following three directions ( shown in fig.[wn ] ) , in which @xmath19 : @xmath20     for @xmath21 near its minimum .",
    "boundedness from below , confining aspects , and @xmath22 symmetry are illustrated . ]",
    "@xmath14 possesses an absolute minimum for @xmath23 , and near this minimum we have @xmath24      the quantization procedure developed in our previous papers @xcite , leads to the following quantum hamiltonian @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 where we made the fundamental split between the isotropic and anisotropic parts of the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "we will refer to anisotropic variables as ` internal ' degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath28 are purely numerical constants dependent on the choice of the so - called _ fiducial _ vector @xmath29 involved in the quantization procedure .",
    "the vector @xmath29 sets a family of coherent states in the hilbert space of the quantum model . to obtain simplified expressions for the constants , we change our choice of @xmath29 made in our previous paper @xcite .",

    "we obtain these constants as elementary functions of the free parameter @xmath35 @xmath36 , \\quad \\frak{k}_3 = \\exp \\left[- \\frac{1}{18\\nu}\\right ] \\,.\\ ] ] they are also given in table [ constk ] together with 5 other similar constants whose appearance through various expressions in the article results from our acs approach .",
    ".constants @xmath37 , @xmath38 as functions of the free parameter @xmath35 appearing in the fiducial vector [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we address the stability of excited states by imposing @xmath39 as the initial state .",
    "the numerical integration includes again the first 12 eigenstates @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we find that the excitations are spread by the bounce among the first 8 energy levels .",
    "in other words , the evolution of the system is not strictly adiabatic in this case , however the spreading does not involve a very large number of states .    the figure [ figure3 ] shows the evolution of the scale factor undergoing the bounce .",
    "we notice that the slopes in the plot are slightly different before and after the bounce : this is the effect of the backreaction of the anisotropic variables on the scale factor .",
    "the figure [ figure4 ] illustrates the nonadiabatic behavior with the decay of the level @xmath44 and the excitation of other energy levels as @xmath45 for instance .",
    "the last panel shows that the mean expectation value @xmath46 reaches @xmath47 in the limit far from the bounce .",
    "the figure [ figure5 ] illustrates the spreading of the state during its evolution in terms of @xmath48 .",
    "we remark that the ratio reaches the asymptotic limit value @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , it contradicts @xmath50 , the true adiabatic behavior , though the spreading is limited .     as a function of the conformal time @xmath51 .",
    "the initial value of @xmath52 is @xmath53 and the initial state is @xmath54 . ]",
    "in the present paper we have derived the complete and consistent set of equations of motion for the quantum mixmaster universe within the vibronic framework .",
    "it includes the entanglement between the isotropic and anisotropic components of the hilbert space , resulting in backreation of the latter on the former .",
    "this framework is a natural extension of the adiabatic approximations studied by us before .",
    "the anisotropy variables are given a full quantum treatment , whereas the treatment of the isotropic variables is confined to semiclassical states in order to reproduce the classical theory away from the bounce .",
    "the bianchi - ix anisotropy potential was approximated by the harmonic potential , which led to results quantitatively valid only in the deep quantum regime .",
    "nevertheless , it is expected that the qualitative features of the approximated model , like singularity resolution , stability of the bo - type solutions , excitation of anisotropy in the remaining solutions and the subsequent phase of accelerated expansion , correspond to the behavior of the exact model .",
    "this approach comprises , as one of the equations of motion , the modified friedmann equation , similar to the one obtained previously for the adiabatic solutions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the coefficients of the present friedmann - like equation are time - dependent and their evolution is governed by the supplementary schrdinger equation .",
    "we resorted to numerical simulations in order to investigate the singularity resolution and stability issues in this extended framework .",
    "we studied numerically the stability of the ground state , which corresponds to the quantum friedmann universe , and the first few excited states . in agreement with the adiabatic approximations @xcite",
    ", we found that the ground state of our model remains stable throughout the bounce even if mixing between isotropic and anisotropic states is allowed .",
    "the evolution of the slightly excited eigenstates is no longer adiabatic and the stability of the bounce is apparently weakened .",
    "we observe the effect of the backreaction of anisotropic variables on the isotropic ones through the slope change in the plot of the semiclassical averaged scale factor in the conformal time , which takes place just after the bounce due to the anisotropy production .",
    "next steps could include taking into account higher excited states to see if the breaking of stability gets even more robust and manifest .",
    "however , increasing the excitation number also makes the quantitative predictions of our model less reliable because of the employed harmonic approximation .",
    "ultimately , we will need to include the exact anisotropy potential of the mixmaster universe , or a more accurate approximation , which is possibly achievable only with numerical solutions to the respective eigenvalue problem .    concerning the possible extension of the presented framework , the bouncing scenario might be considered as a scattering process . as in the far past and future , for large values of the scale factor @xmath52 , the anisotropy potential vanishes , it is possible to reformulate the whole evolution in the interaction picture , which prompts a suitable definition of the @xmath55-matrix .",
    "such an approach should provide enough information on the origin of the present classical space - time , viewed as an asymptotic state away from the regime of strong quantum interaction , into which another classical and formerly contracting space - time had collapsed .",
