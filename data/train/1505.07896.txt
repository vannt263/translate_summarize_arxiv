    "crystallization and melting have long been central subjects in statistical physics .",
    "these processes connect microscopic nucleation with the macroscopic phenomena of domain growth and of phase transitions .",
    "a number of numerical methods and simulation techniques have been brought to bear on these subjects , following the pioneering computer simulations of hard - sphere systems by both monte carlo  @xcite and by molecular dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the hard - sphere system is trivial to describe .",
    "nevertheless , equilibration in this simplest of all particle systems is a slow process , because of the large activation free energy for crystallization .",
    "timescales are also especially large in the fluid - solid coexistence regime , because of the surface tension between coexisting phases .",
    "specialized algorithms for equilibration have been developed to overcome these problems , and the melting and crystallization time scales provide useful benchmarks for their comparison .    a rejection - free hard - sphere `` event - chain '' monte carlo algorithm ( ecmc )  @xcite has recently allowed to speed up equilibration for two - dimensional hard disks by roughly two orders of magnitude compared to the event - driven molecular dynamics  @xcite ( edmd ) and to local monte carlo  @xcite ( lmc ) . in ecmc ,",
    "a randomly sampled starting sphere moves along a straight line until the latter collides with another sphere , which then moves in the same direction until it collides itself with yet another sphere .",
    "this continues until the spheres total displacement equals a certain fixed length @xmath0 .",
    "ecmc breaks detailed balance ( moves are in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 directions only ) yet satisfies global balance and ergodicity  @xcite .",
    "it rigorously samples the equilibrium boltzmann distribution .",
    "considerable speedup was also demonstrated for the extension of ecmc to continuous potentials  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we assess the speed of ecmc , edmd , and lmc not by computing autocorrelation functions in equilibrium , but rather by the time scales associated with melting and crystallization in systems of many spheres at high density .",
    "we expect our observations to extend to subjects as dense packing , nucleation and jamming .",
    "we focus on the melting from the metastable solid branch to the stable liquid ( that is , slightly below the liquid  solid coexistence interval ) and",
    "also the nucleation processes from the metastable liquid branch towards the stable solid slightly above coexistence .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : our model system and our methods are described in section  [ s : model_algorithms_observables ] , together with the observables on which we focus : the non - dimensional pressure and the local and global orientational order parameters .",
    "results are summarized in section  [ s : results ] : we reproduce the phase diagram by ecmc and quantify the efficiencies of our three methods .",
    "we discuss the relative efficiency of ecmc and edmd for the crystallization process .",
    "concluding remarks are described in section  [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider @xmath4 monodisperse hard spheres of radius @xmath5 in a cubic box of sides @xmath6 with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "the density ( packing fraction ) @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 .",
    "we concentrate on melting and crystallization from the unstable to the stable phase , i.e. , from the unstable crystalline branch to the liquid and from the unstable liquid branch to the crystal . for our melting runs , at density @xmath9 below the coexistence interval of liquid and solid phases , we prepare the initial configurations as perfect fcc crystals , corresponding to the stable phase at high densities ( the free energy difference between fcc and hcp crystal have been discussed actively since the works of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the fcc initial conditions are compatible with the cubic simulation box .",
    "for the crystallization runs at density @xmath10 above the coexistence interval , we start from a fluid initial configuration at a liquid - phase density @xmath11 . in order to reach the higher target density , we repeatedly increase @xmath5 slightly and remove all created overlaps by sliding overlapping pairs of spheres for a half length of overlap along their common symmetry axis .",
    "this is done until all pair overlaps have disappeared .    in edmd ,",
    "hard spheres evolve in continuous physical time through collisions , and the dynamics solves newton s classical equations of motion .",
    "we use an efficient sequential implementation  @xcite .",
    "lmc and ecmc are implemented very simply . for the former",
    ", the optimal displacement of spheres is determined by short lmc runs from the initial conditions so that the acceptance ratio is 1/2 . for the latter , a single parameter , the chain length @xmath0 , must be optimized for each density .",
    "a single event can be implemented very quickly in ecmc , as the motion is always in + x or + y , which decreases the cpu time per event .",
    "we consider systems with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 spheres .",
    "our calculations are mainly done on the intel xeon cpu e5 - 2680 2.80ghz , where we reach @xmath15 events / h of cpu time for ecmc and @xmath16 collisions / h for edmd .",
    "for the lmc algorithm , @xmath17 trials / h are reached .",
    "all our comparisons of algorithms are in terms of cpu time . to be as fair as possible , the three algorithms were implemented following unified design principles .",
    "furthermore , we used the same computer , the same language ( intel fortran ) , and the same optimal option of compiler .",
    "an event - count would have produced similar results .",
    "we track the time - evolution of the ordering / disordering of the system from the pressure and the local and global orientational order parameters . in edmd ,",
    "the nondimensional virial pressure is computed from the collision rate via the virial theorem : @xmath18 , \\label{e : pressure_md}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the total simulation time , and @xmath20 is the inverse kinetic temperature ( mass @xmath21 and mean - square @xmath22-component of velocity of spheres ) . the collision force @xmath23 is defined between the relative positions and the relative velocities of the collision partners  @xcite . in ecmc , the pressure @xmath24 can be evaluated from the mean excess chain displacement  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are final and initial positions of each chain , respectively , taking into account the pbc .",

    "the pressures fluctuate around @xmath30 , and agree within very tight error bars .",
    "besides the pressure , we quantify the speed of melting and of crystallization via the time - dependent local @xmath31 and global @xmath32 order parameters  @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of nearest neighbors for each sphere @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the spherical harmonics with icosahedral symmetry for the distance vector @xmath37 between spheres @xmath35 and @xmath38 .",

    "we note that in three - dimensional hard spheres , the direct simulation remains difficult in the coexistence region , even for ecmc , whereas for the analogous two - dimensional hard disks , the equilibration of the coexisting hexatic and liquid phases by ecmc proved possible at all densities , for up to one million disks.@xcite            fig .",

    "specifically , for @xmath57 , simulations from arbitrary initial conditions converge to the same pressure since the system is completely liquid and nucleation barriers are low . in the region of @xmath58 , simulations from fcc initial configurations successfully create interfaces with different topologies , whereas simulations from fluid initial conditions remain on the fluid branch .",
    "the pressure at @xmath59 decreases as @xmath60 , and agrees with the expected coexistence pressure .",
    "@xcite the phase coexistence at equilibrium can be seen clearly by the spatial distributions of the local @xmath31 order parameter , where the fcc crystal reduces to a droplet ( @xmath61 ) when started from an fcc crystal . for larger densities ( @xmath62 ) the remaining fcc phase has the form of a cylinder that reconnects through the pbc , surrounded by the liquid dominant phase created through melting ( see the insets of fig .",

    "even with respect to molecular dynamics , it performs very well .",
    "the clearest advantage of ecmc over edmd shows up in the crystallization , that is , in the buildup of long - range correlations .",
    "we expect the ecmc algorithm and its extension to continuous potentials to be helpful to investigate jamming and to estimate accurate nucleation rate  @xcite and to analyze the full scenario of nucleation and precursor crystallization  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest might be that ecmc remains event - driven even for continuous potentials and very simple to implement .",
