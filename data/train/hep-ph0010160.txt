    "it is widely accepted that the pomeron in qcd corresponds to an infinite sum of gluon ladders with reggeized gluons on the vertical lines ( see fig .  1 ) , resulting  @xcite in the so - called supercritical behavior @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the intercept of the pomeron trajectory . in that approach ,",
    "the main contribution to the inelastic amplitude and to the absorptive part of the elastic amplitude in the forward direction arises from the multi - regge kinematics in the limit @xmath20 and leading logarithmic approximation . in the next - to - leading logarithmic approximation ( nlla ) ,",
    "corrections require also the contribution from the quasi - multi - regge kinematics  @xcite .",
    "hence , the subenergies between neighboring @xmath1-channel gluons must be large enough to be in the regge domain . at finite total energies , this implies that the amplitude is represented by a finite sum of @xmath21 terms  @xcite , where @xmath21 increases like @xmath22 , rather than by the solution of the bfkl integral equation  @xcite .",
    "the interest in the first few terms of the series is related to the fact that the energies reached by the present accelerators are not high enough to accommodate a large number of @xmath1-channel gluons that eventually hadronize and give rise to clusters of secondary particles .",
    "the lowest order diagram is that of two - gluon exchange , first considered by low and nussinov  @xcite .",
    "the next order , involving an @xmath1-channel gluon rung was studied e.g. in the papers  @xcite .",
    "the problem of calculating these diagrams is twofold .",
    "the first one is connected with the nonperturbative contributions to the scattering amplitude in the  soft  region .",
    "it may be ignored by  freezing  the running coupling constant at some fixed value of the momenta transferred and assuming that the forward amplitude can be cast by a smooth interpolation to @xmath0 .",
    "more consistently , one introduces a nonperturbative model  @xcite of the gluon propagator valid also in the forward direction .",
    "the second problem is more technical : as @xmath23 the number of feynman diagrams that contribute to the leading order rapidly increases and , in each of them , only the leading contribution is usually evaluated . at any order in the coupling ,",
    "subleading terms coming both from the neglected diagrams and from the calculated ones are present .",
    "although functionally the result is always the sum of increasing powers of logarithms , the numerical values of the coefficients entering the sum is lost unless all diagrams are calculated .",
    "conversely , one can expand the `` supercritical '' pomeron @xmath24 in powers of @xmath25 .",
    "such and expansion is legitimate within the range of active accelerators , i.e. near and below the tev energy region , where fits to total cross sections by a power or logarithms are known  @xcite to be equivalent numerically . moreover , forward scattering data ( total cross sections and the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude ) do not discriminate even between a single and quadratic fit in @xmath25 to the data .",
    "phenomenologically , more information on the nature of the series can be gained if the @xmath26 dependence is also involved .",
    "the well - known ( diffractive ) dip - bump structure of the differential cross section can be roughly imitated by the glauber series , although more refined studies within the dipole pomeron model ( dp ) ( linear behavior in @xmath25 )  @xcite show that the relevant series is not just the glauber one .",
    "a generalization of the dp model including higher powers of @xmath25 was considered in  @xcite . in a recent paper  @xcite",
    "the pomeron was considered as a finite series of ladder diagrams , including one gluon rung besides the low - nussinov `` born term '' and resulting in a constant plus logarithmic term in the total cross section . with",
    "a sub - leading regge term added , good fits to @xmath27 and @xmath28 total as well as differential cross section were obtained in  @xcite .",
    "there is however a substantial difference between our approach and that of ref .",
    "@xcite or simple decomposition in powers of @xmath25 , namely that we consider the opening channels ( in @xmath1 ) as threshold effects , the relevant prongs being separated in rapidity by @xmath29 , @xmath30 being a parameter related to the average subenergy in the ladder .",
    "although such an approach inevitably introduces new parameters , we consider it more adequate in the framework of the finite - ladder approach .",
    "we mention these attempts only for the sake of completeness , although we stick to the simplest case of @xmath0 , where there are hopes to have some connection with the qcd calculations .",
    "in section 2 we consider a new parametrization for total cross sections based on the contribution from a finite series of qcd diagrams with relative weights ( coefficients ) and rapidity gaps to be determined from the data .",
    "each set of the diagrams is `` active '' in `` its zone '' , i.e. the parameters should be fitted in each energy interval separately and the relevant solutions should match .",
    "the matching procedure will be similar to that known for the wave functions in quantum mechanics , i.e. we require continuity of the total cross section and of its first derivative . in section 3",
    "we present the result of fits to the @xmath28 and @xmath27 experimental data .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a discussion of the truncated series in qcd and to the calculation of the coefficients of the powers of @xmath22 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we will draw our conclusions .",
    "the pomeron contribution to the total cross section is represented in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath30 is the prong threshold , @xmath33 is the step function and @xmath34 . here and in the following , by @xmath1 and @xmath30 respectively , @xmath1/(1gev@xmath35 ) and @xmath30/(1gev@xmath35 ) is implied .",
    "the main assumption in eq .",
    "( [ z1 ] ) is that the widths of the rapidity gaps @xmath36 are the same along the ladder .",
    "the functions @xmath37 are polynomials in @xmath38 of degree @xmath39 , corresponding to finite gluon ladder diagrams in qcd , where each power of the logarithm collects all the relevant diagrams . when @xmath1 increases and reaches a new threshold , a new prong opens adding a new power in @xmath38 .",
    "in the energy region between two neighbouring thresholds , the corresponding @xmath37 , given in eq .",
    "( [ z1 ] ) , is supposed to represent adequately the total cross section .    in eq .",
    "( [ z1 ] ) the sum over @xmath21 is a finite one , since @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath25 , where @xmath1 is the present squared c.m .",
    "energy . hence this model is quite different from the usual approach where , in the limit @xmath40 , the infinite sum of the leading logarithmic contributions gives rise to an integral equation for the amplitude .    to make the idea clearer",
    ", we describe the mechanism in the case of three gaps ( two rungs ) . to remedy the effect of the first threshold and get a smooth behavior at low energies , we have included also a pomeron daughter , going like @xmath41 in the first two gaps with parameters @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively",
    ". then @xmath44 by imposing the requirement of continuity ( of the cross section and of its first derivative ) one constrains the parameters .",
    "e.g. , from the conditions @xmath45 and @xmath46 the relations @xmath47 @xmath48 follow . furthermore , from @xmath49 and",
    "@xmath50 one gets @xmath51 @xmath52 the same procedure can be repeated for any number of gaps .    in fitting the model to the data , we rely mainly on @xmath28 data that extend to the highest ( accelerator ) energies , to which the pomeron is particularly sensitive . to increase the confidence level , @xmath27 data were included in the fit as well . to keep the number of the free parameters as small as possible and following the successful phenomenological approach of donnachie and landshoff  @xcite , a single  effective",
    " reggeon trajectory with intercept @xmath53 will account for nonleading contributions , thus leading to the following form for the total cross section : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is given by eq .",
    "( [ z1 ] ) and @xmath56 ( the parameter @xmath57 is different for @xmath28 and @xmath27 and is considered as an additional free parameter ) .",
    "ideally , one would let free the width of the gap @xmath30 and consequently the number of gluon rungs ( highest power of @xmath38 ) . although possible , technically this is very difficult",
    ". therefore we considered only the cases of two and three rungs and , for each of them , we treated @xmath30 as a free parameter .",
    "notice that the values of the parameters depend on the energy range of the fitting procedure .",
    "for example , the values of the parameters in @xmath58 if fitted in `` its '' range , i.e. for @xmath59 , will get modified in @xmath60 with the higher energy data and correspondingly higher order diagrams included .",
    "as a first attempt , only three rapidity gaps , that correspond to two gluon rungs in the ladder were considered .",
    "fits to the @xmath28 and @xmath27 data were performed from @xmath61 gev up to the highest energy tevatron data ( for @xmath28 ) , including all the results from there  @xcite .",
    "the resulting fit is shown in fig .  2 with a @xmath62/d.o.f .",
    "the values of the fitted parameters are quoted in table  1 .",
    "interestingly , the value of @xmath30 turns out to be very close to 144 gev@xmath35 , i.e. the value for which the energy range considered is covered with equal rapidity gaps uniformly .",
    "next , we covered the energy span available in the accelerator region by four gaps , resulting in 3 gluon rungs and consequently @xmath64 as the maximal power .",
    "after the matching procedure , we are left with ten free parameters : first of all @xmath30 , then @xmath65 , @xmath66 , each determined in its range , while the two @xmath57 s and @xmath67 are fitted in the whole range of the data .",
    "the final value for @xmath30 turned out to be @xmath68 gev@xmath35 resulting in a sequence of energy intervals ending at @xmath69 gev .",
    "it is amusing to notice that a search for the phase space region where the production amplitude in the multicluster configuration has a maximum leads , with the help of cosmic ray data , to an average `` subenergy '' @xmath70 gev@xmath35  @xcite , that is very near to the value of @xmath30 found in the fit .",
    "3 shows our fit to the @xmath28 and @xmath27 total cross section data .",
    "the values of the fitted parameters are quoted in table  2 .",
    "the value of the @xmath71d.o.f . is @xmath72 , much better than in the case of two gluon rungs .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the coefficients in front of the leading logarithms are related roughly by a factor of 1/10 .",
    "the value of the effective reggeon intercept remains rather low , close to 0.45 , comparable with the value found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "from the theoretical point of view , the phenomenological model of section 2 corresponds to the explicit evaluation in qcd of gluonic ladders with an increasing number of @xmath1-channel gluons .",
    "this correspondence is far from literal since each term of the bfkl series takes into account only the dominant logarithm in the limit @xmath73 . in the following we give concrete expressions for the forward high energy scattering amplitudes for photons and hadrons in the form of an expansion in powers of large logarithms in the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "we start from known results obtained in paper  @xcite where an explicit expression for the total cross section for hadron - hadron scattering has been obtained . in the high energy limit",
    ", it is convenient to introduce the mellin transform of the amplitude @xmath74 and its inverse @xmath75 the general expression of @xmath76 in the leading logarithmic approximation has the form : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( see next equation ) are the impact factors of the colliding hadrons @xmath57 and @xmath80 , obeying the gauge conditions @xmath81 @xmath82 .",
    "the quantity @xmath83 obeys the bfkl equation : @xmath84 with @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 the strong coupling @xmath88 is assumed to be frozen at a suitable scale set , for example , by the external particles . the iteration procedure and the reciprocal mellin transform",
    "give ( besides we put @xmath89 ) : @xmath90\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and the subsequent iterations begin from @xmath92 .",
    "in the previous integral and everywhere in the following , all the momenta are 2-dimensional euclidean vectors , living in the plane transverse to the one formed by the momenta of the colliding particles .",
    "for the case of photon - photon scattering one has  @xcite ( see also the references quoted there ) @xmath93 where @xmath94 @xmath95 from the integrals @xmath96 @xmath97= \\frac{1.443}{m^2}\\;,\\ ] ] we conclude @xmath98\\ ; , \\label{zs}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is a constant and we used the approximated equality @xmath100 .    to obtain the cross section of proton - proton scattering , we use the ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite for the impact factor of a hadron in terms of its form factor @xmath101 : @xmath102 here the 2-dimensional euclidean vector @xmath103 is related to the 4-dimensional transferred momentum @xmath104 by the relation @xmath105 . using the formulae given above , we obtain , for a simplified but experimentally acceptable form of proton s form factor , @xmath106 where @xmath57 and @xmath80 are in gev@xmath107 .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath108 then ( for @xmath109 ) @xmath110 and @xmath111 the integrations can be performed analytically , due to the simple choice of the impact factor in eq .",
    "( [ zf ] ) , and the final result is : @xmath112\\rho^2 + \\right.\\ ] ] @xmath113 \\rho^3+\\ldots \\right\\}\\;. \\label{za}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ zr ] ) .    as stressed above , the coefficients of different powers of @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ za ] ) refer to the dominant contribution , at asymptotic energies , for each perturbative order . in the fit , instead",
    ", the pomeron contribution is determined only from the experimental data at high but finite energies .",
    "however , we can obtain a rough estimate of the importance of the subleading contributions by comparing eq .",
    "( [ za ] ) with the phenomenological fit of the previous section , in particular with the amplitude @xmath116 relative to the last gap of the three rungs case .",
    "if we assume a commonly used value for the strong coupling , @xmath117  @xcite , we must conclude that subleading contributions to the qcd pomeron are important .",
    "this finding may be related to the fact that energies reached by the present accelerators are not yet asymptotic .",
    "although high quality fits were not the primary goal of the present study , we still may conclude that they are compatible with those existing  @xcite , and there is still room for further improvement .",
    "our main goal instead was to seek for an adequate picture of the pomeron exchange at @xmath0 . in our opinion , it is neither an infinite sum of gluon ladders as in the bfkl approach  @xcite , nor its power expansion .",
    "in fact , the finite series - call it `` threshold approach '' - considered in this and our previous paper  @xcite realizes a non trivial dynamical balance between the total reaction energy and the subenergies equally partitioned between the multiperipheral ladders .",
    "an important finding of the present paper , confirmed both by the fits to the @xmath27 and @xmath28 cross sections ( sec .",
    "3 ) and by the qcd calculations ( sec .",
    "4 ) is the rapid convergence of the series .",
    " footprints  of the prongs at low energies are slightly visible in fig .  2 ( especially in the case of @xmath27 scattering where the contribution from secondary reggeons is smaller than in @xmath28 ) .",
    "a more detailed study of this phenomenon may answer the question whether this is merely an artifact or a manifestation of pomeron s basic properties .",
    "the quality of the present fits will be definitely improved when future data from rhic and lhc will be available . as to the qcd calculations , their precision and efficiency",
    "are biased at finite energy by difficulties in estimating non - asymptotic terms , neglected here and elsewhere . as a consequence ,",
    "e.g. in the diagram giving a @xmath2 contribution , the constant and @xmath25 terms ( see fig .  ( 1 ) ) are neglected .    in any case",
    ", few terms of powers of @xmath25 are sufficient to describe the data at all realistic energies . as a guess",
    ", we do not exclude that higher terms cancel completely ,",
    "but anyway they are negligibly small .",
    "the case of two terms ( logarithmic rise in @xmath1 ) is particularly interesting as it corresponds to a dipole pomeron with a number of attractive features  @xcite such as self - reproducibility with respect of unitarity corrections . in case of a @xmath2 rise ( three terms )",
    "we still should not worry about the froissart bound , so ultimately the pomeron as viewed in this paper does not need to be unitarized .",
    "this conclusion is an important by - product of our paper . for the dipole pomeron ,",
    "relevant calculations for @xmath118 are interesting and important but difficult . in the case of a single gluon rung",
    "they were performed in ref .",
    "@xcite and , with a non - perturbative gluon propagator , in the last reference of  @xcite .",
    "the role and the value of the width of the gap , @xmath30 , is an important physical parameter _",
    "per se _ , independent of the model presented above .",
    "we have fitted it and compared successfully with the prediction from cosmic - ray data .",
    "however its value may be estimated e.g. as the lowest energy where the pomeron exchange is manifest , although the latter is also a matter of debate .",
    "further fits of the model to new experimental data may settle some details left open by this paper .",
