    "the present numerical study has confirmed the mean - field scenario in our previous publication , @xcite and moreover , given more detailed and quantitative information . the first transition with orbital and lattice orderings is induced by the intersite orbital interaction which is three - state clock type and spatially anisotropic depending on both the bond direction and the orbital states in two sites .",
    "the anisotropy lifts the degeneracy due to the geometrical frustration inherent to the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the tetragonal jahn - teller coupling also plays an important role to stabilize the particular orbital ordering pattern .",

    "once the orbital ordering takes place , the orbital state affects the spin exchange interactions through the spin - orbital interplay , and reduces the magnetic frustration partially .",
    "as a consequence , the antiferromagnetic spin correlation develops mainly in the one - dimensional chains in the @xmath16 planes .",
    "we found typically about three - times longer correlation length in the @xmath47 direction than in the @xmath164 and @xmath165 directions . at the second transition ,",

    "they need further investigations from both experimental and theoretical viewpoints . besides them",
    ", another important problem is the carrier doping effect on the mott insulating materials , such as the li doping in zn@xmath329li@xmath330v@xmath1o@xmath2 . in experiments , it is known that the doping rapidly destroys the ordered states at @xmath331 , and replaces them by a glassy state .",
