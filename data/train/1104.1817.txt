    "lvy - like motions represent an important family of random motions , generated by a stochastic process with stationary and independent increments .",
    "brownian motion constitutes a particular case of this family , but its mathematical tractability and its remarkable statistical properties have led it to become the principal model of random motion .",
    "however , different types of lvy motions have been extensively investigated , both theoretically and experimentally , as they have been found to be ubiquitous in nature : in biology @xcite , chaotic dynamics @xcite , economics @xcite , search strategies @xcite , the lvy motion that have been observed are characterized by increments of arbitrary length @xmath2 , with a step length distribution featuring an algebric tail @xmath3 .",
    "such a distribution is said to be heavy - tailed and has a diverging variance for @xmath4 .",
    "an interesting experimental situation where lvy motion can be detected is diffusion in heterogeneous and porous materials , composed of two o more types of regions with different diffusion properties . in that case , the motion of particles consists of a sequence of scattering events occurring in the hard - scattering part of the material , followed by long jumps performed at almost constant velocity in the non - scattering regions . if the material is very heterogeneous on all scales , the step length results to be heavy - tail lvy - distributed .",
    "this description applies to transmission of light through clouds @xcite , tracer transport in heterogeneous aquifers @xcite , molecular diffusion at low pressure in porous media  which is dominated by collision with pore walls , with ballistic motion inside the large pores @xcite  , as well as in fractured and heterogeneous porous media @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent experiments on new disordered optical materials , the lvy glasses , paved the way to the engineering of levy - distributed step - lengths @xcite .",
    "this phenomenology is often modeled in terms of _ annealed _ lvy walks , where step - lengths are uncorrelated @xcite .    however , a key signature of these processes is that the steps are in principle not independent , as they are correlated by their mutual positions in the sample .",
    "a walker that has just traversed a large hole has a high probability of being backscattered at the following step and thus to perform a jump of roughly the same length .",
    "the step length distribution represents therefore a `` quenched disorder '' , a standard definition in statistical mechanics of disordered systems @xcite .",
    "now , while the case of lvy walks with uncorrelated jumps is well understood @xcite , the correlation effects , which are expected to exert a deep influence on the diffusion properties , are still to be characterised , and the upper critical dimension above which a description in terms of uncorrelated levy walks proves sufficient is still under debate @xcite .",
    "a first step in this direction has been taken , and to this end , quenched lvy processes have been studied on one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "there , the effects of geometry - induced step - length correlation on the asymptotic behavior of the mean square displacement has been investigated in detail .",
    "more recently , again for one - dimensional systems , different aspects regarding the scaling properties of random - walk distributions , the relations between the dynamical exponents and the possible average procedures have been discussed in a common framework .",
    "this evidenced the strong effects of correlations also on quantities averaged over all the starting sites @xcite .",
    "obviously , one - dimensional models represent simplified systems and may not compare quantitatively to real experiments , so far conducted on three dimensional systems . on the other hand , they have proven amenable to an exact analytic solution for the dynamics .",
    "it is now important to keep track of what properties observed in one dimensional systems can be extended to higher dimensions .",
    "the key point is to understand the effects of step - length correlations and of averages over starting points , and what is needed is a proper model for the heterogeneous geometrical pattern where the correlated lvy motion takes place .    in this paper",
    "we model the transport process as a random walk on scale - invariant structures  namely generalized two- and and three - dimensional sierpinski carpets  whose solid and empty regions represent portions of material characterized by different transmission properties . in order to reproduce a realistic propagation ,",
    "our process consists of a simple diffusive random walk on the solid regions of the structure , and of a ballistic motion across its empty regions .",
    "therefore , while the distribution of allowed jump lengths is scale - invariant , any point in the two- or three - dimensional region of space occupied by the structure is accessible to the walker .",
    "this is at variance with the well - known and studied case of standard diffusion on self - similar structures , where the empty regions are not accessible @xcite , and the motion takes place on a truly fractal space . from a more rigorous point of view the ballistic propagation of the walker across the `` empty '' regions of fractal structure can be equivalently obtained by imposing a scale invariant pattern of persistence on the sites of a regular euclidean lattice @xcite .",
    "it should be remarked that the available experimental realizations are characterized by a strong amount of disorder @xcite , which might call into question our modeling of the pattern of inhomogeneity in terms of deterministic , self - similar structures .",
    "however , the regular distribution of the inhomogeneities allows us to take into account several crucial points in a more controlled way .",
    "we are able to give an estimate of the effects of the tail in the step length distribution in terms of the geometrical parameters characterizing the lvy quasicrystals , and we can tune it arbitrarily to study its effects ; we can correctly control the effects of the averages over the starting sites , which is known to have a deep influence the asymptotic properties of the mean square displacement in one - dimensional structures ; most importantly , we are able to take a first step towards the comprehension of correlated lvy walks in higher dimensions",
    ".    one of our main results is that , for this type of \" topological  correlations , quenched lvy walks lead to a set of exponents for the asymptotic behaviors of the mean square displacements and transmission which differ from the uncorrelated case @xcite .    in detail , in this paper , we tackle the problem by verifying the scaling hypothesis for the probability distribution @xmath5 , namely the probability for the lvy walker to be at a distance @xmath6 from its starting site @xmath7 at time @xmath8 @xcite and by evaluating the dynamical exponent @xmath1 associated to the growth of the scaling length @xmath9 of the process .",
    "this is a function of a tunable geometrical parameter , @xmath0 , describing the self similar pattern of empty regions in the lvy quasicrystals , and playing a role analogous to the exponent characterizing the step - length distribution in random systems .",
    "then , by making the reasonable and well verified `` single long jump '' hypothesis @xcite , we estimate the tails of @xmath10 , i.e. the average of @xmath5 over all the possible starting sites .",
    "we derive an analytic expression for the asymptotic behaviors of the moments @xmath11 of @xmath10 , evidencing the presence of strongly anomalous diffusion @xcite , i.e. @xmath12 . in the attempt of making a direct contact with experiments",
    ", we also derive the scaling properties of exit times , as well as of the time - resolved transmission probability and transmission profiles through a slab of thickness @xmath13 .",
    "extensive numerical simulations are in very good agreement with the predicted behaviors .    the paper is organized as follows : in the following section we describe our levy quasicrystals based on generalized sierpinski carpets ( sc ) . in section [ physical ] we introduce the relevant physical quantities that we will study in this paper . in section [ scalings ] we discuss the scaling hypothesis and the _ single - long - jump approximation _ which allows us to evaluate the momenta of the distribution @xmath10 evidencing the presence of strongly anomalous diffusion @xcite . in the last part of the paper we present extensive numerical simulations proving the reliability of our scaling hypothesis and single long jump approach . in particular , we evaluate the dynamical exponent @xmath1 as a function of the dimensionality , of the dynamics and of @xmath0 , a simple parameter describing the topology of the structure . for a slab of thickness @xmath13",

    "we then consider a random walker that can jump across empty regions .",
    "this is actually a lvy process provided that the linear size of such regions  and hence the length of the ballistic jumps  is lvy - distributed .",
    "specifically , it is a lvy walk if all jumps are performed at constant velocity , and hence completed in a time proportional to their length .",
    "the cantor lattices considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , are deterministic one - dimensional structures exhibiting the desired properties .",
    "the natural two - dimensional generalization of such structures is provided by the so - called sierpinski carpets discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the self - similar character of a sc can be illustrated by observing that several identical objects can be assembled to give a larger sc .",
    "one way to describe this constructive procedure is the following : arrange @xmath17 sc of generation @xmath18 in a square array , and subsequently remove some , so that only @xmath19 of them remain .",
    "the resulting object is a sc of generation @xmath20 .",
    "if the same procedure is repeated using scs of generation @xmath20 as building blocks , a structure of generation @xmath21 is obtained .",
    "figure [ sc_3_8 ] illustrates this algorithm in the case of the standard two dimensional sc , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the structure of generation @xmath22 is a simple lattice site . at each generation a @xmath23 array of carpets is laid out , and the central structure is removed , leaving a square empty region .",
    "note that the linear size of the largest empty region in the structure grows by a factor @xmath24 as the generation is increased .",
    "a different structure , corresponding to @xmath25 and @xmath26 , can be obtained by laying out a @xmath27 array of building blocks , and subsequently removing the four innermost structures . in general",
    "a sc of generation @xmath18 features @xmath28 empty regions of linear @xmath29 , with @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath18 is sufficiently large , the linear size of the empty regions spans several orders of magnitude .",
    "for instance the 3rd generation structure in fig [ sc_3_8 ] features one empty region of linear size @xmath31 , @xmath32 empty regions of linear size @xmath33 and @xmath34 empty regions of linear size @xmath35 .",
    "one of the parameters characterizing a sc is its fractal dimension , i.e. the average number of sites per unit surface , which is has a simple expression in terms of the constructive parameters @xmath36 a more relevant characterization for our purposes can be given in terms of the probability for the length of the jumps that can be taken at a random site of the structure . for each of the possible jump lengths",
    "@xmath29 this probability is given by density of sites on the boundary of empty regions of linear size @xmath29 .",
    "it is easy to prove that the moments of such probability @xmath37 converge only if @xmath38 , where @xmath39 this parameter has exactly the same role as the exponent @xmath0 characterizing the distribution of the step lengths @xmath40 of a levy walk in @xmath41 dimensions , whose @xmath42-th moment @xmath43 converges only if @xmath38 .    for the sierpinski carpets discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite the threshold in eq .",
    "is connected to the fractal dimension of the structure , @xmath44 . since @xmath45",
    "the size of the average empty region , i.e. the first moment of the distribution , is infinite .",
    "third generation of a fc with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the `` exploded view '' in the lower left corner illustrates the tiling pattern underlying the structure .",
    "three different types of tiles are necessary to build the structure : @xmath48 fcs of generation @xmath16 , whose side comprises @xmath49 sites , @xmath50 empty square tiles of side @xmath51 and @xmath52 rectangular padding tiles , highlighted in a lighter shading.,width=302 ]    the two dimensional counterparts of the _ cantor - smith - volterra _ sets discussed e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite are hyerarchical structures similar to sierpinski carpets for which @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we refer to these structures as _ fat carpets _ ( fc ) .",
    "as we discuss above , a sc of generation @xmath18 can be seen as a @xmath55 square tiling whose elements have the same size as sc of generation @xmath56 .",
    "some of these elements are actual scs , while others are left empty .",
    "the tiling in a fc is sligthly more complex , in that it requires three kinds of tiles , as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fc_9_2 ] .",
    "this comes about because , in order to attain @xmath53 , the largest empty tiles at a given generation must grow less than the entire structure as the generation is increased .",
    "more specifically , a fc of generation @xmath20 contains @xmath57 fcs of generation @xmath18 , whose side is @xmath58 , @xmath59 empty square tiles of side @xmath60 and @xmath61 rectangular @xmath58 by @xmath60 tiles .",
    "if @xmath62 and @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , we get @xmath65 so that the fraction of sites contained in the rectangular padding tiles decreases as @xmath66 . thus , for sufficiently large generations , the contribution of the padding tiles becomes negligible and the total number of sites in the structure is proportional @xmath67 .",
    "this means that the threshold for finite moments in the probability for the length of the jump at a random site of the fc is once again given by the quantity in eq .  .",
    "since @xmath68 , @xmath53 and the average size of the empty regions is finite .",
    "all of the above discussion can be easily generalized to arbitrary dimension @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , in section  [ scalings ] , the _ single - long - jump _ picture is illustrated for a generic dimension @xmath41 .",
    "as to the simulations , we mainly focus on two - dimensional structures , but we also present some results for three - dimensional _ sponge - like _ structures .",
    "let us now get back to the diffusion dynamics of the random walk .",
    "this is based on the standard dynamics on a regular square lattice : one direction out of the four possible ones pointing to the adjacent sites is randomly chosen .",
    "if a site is found in that direction at a distance of a single lattice spacing , then the jump is taken , and the time is increased by one unit . if the same jump would land inside an empty region , then the random walk traverses the entire region and lands at a site belonging to a different boundary from that containing the starting site .",
    "[ jumps ] illustrates the two possible schemes for the choice of the arrival site we consider in this work . in the simpler scheme ( left panel ) the walker lands at the site facing its current position ( _ head - on dynamics _ ) . in the second scheme ( right panel )",
    "the landing site is randomly chosen among those belonging to any of the sides of the empty region except the one currently hosting the random walk ( _ fan - out dynamics _ ) . in any case , since the random walk moves at constant velocity , the time required for a jump equals its length .",
    "note that the jump probability of these two dynamics are different at any distance scale .",
    "therefore we expect that parameters usually exhibiting universal character might be different for the two cases .",
    "in fact , our simulations evidence that the dynamical exponent governing the growth of the characteristic length of the process seems to depend on the dynamics , on the dimensionality of the system and on the geometric parameter @xmath0 .",
    "conversely , a very robust feature we observe is that anomalous diffusion takes place strictly for @xmath45 for every case considered here .",
    "this is at variance with the case of uncorrelated lvy walks , where @xmath45 and @xmath69 correspond to purely ballistic propagation and superdiffusion , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the diffusion process on the structures under concern can be characterized by several quantities .",
    "one of the most natural is the probability @xmath5 that at time @xmath8 the random walk is at a distance @xmath6 from the lattice site @xmath7 it started from .",
    "the average of this probability over all the lattice sites , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of lattice sites , is a meaningful quantity as well , in view of the spatial inhomogeneity of the scs and fcs @xcite . as we will discuss shortly , it highlights the anomalies in the behaviour of the diffusive process .",
    "these probability distributions are completely defined by their moments , @xmath72 a further quantity worth analyzing is the escape time probability , namely the probability @xmath73 that a walker starting at a random site of a structure of linear size @xmath13 escapes from it at time @xmath8 .",
    "an even more direct contact with the experiment is provided by the _",
    "conditional first - passage time _",
    "@xmath74 , i.e. the probability that a particle injected at a site @xmath7 belonging to one boundary of the structure hits a site @xmath75 belonging to the opposite boundary at time @xmath8 before going back to the boundary containing @xmath7 , which is therefore absorbing .",
    "this means that there is a ( large ) probability that the injected particles are backscattered by the structure . as to the direction parallel to the entrance and exit boundaries , we consider two possible schemes . in the first , the random walk is simply reflected by the boundaries of the structure . in the second the environment seen by the random walk is periodic , i.e. it consists of an infinite stack of identical structures of some fixed generation .",
    "the conditional first - passage time gives access to experimentally relevant quantities .",
    "for instance , it is clearly related , through integration over time , to the transmission profiles shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. the average number of processes transmitted through the sample at a transverse distance @xmath6 from the injection point .",
    "specifically , on a 2d system of linear size @xmath13 , these are obtained as @xmath76    likewise , averaging over entrance sites and summing over exit sites gives the the time - resolved transmission probability , @xmath77 finally , integrating this quantity over time gives the total transmitted intensity , i.e. the fraction of processes transmitted through the sample @xmath78",
    "several of the quantities discussed in the previous section depend on time and on a spatial variable .",
    "the latter can be the walk distance @xmath6 in the case of the local and average probabilities @xmath5 and @xmath10 , or the system size @xmath13 in the case of the escape probability .",
    "a generic function of space and time is expected to exhibit the following scaling structure @xmath79 where the asymptotic behaviour of the characteristic length is @xmath80 notice that the prefactor in r.h.s .",
    "of eq .   depends only on time .",
    "an alternative , equivalent form of this equation is also possible , featuring a prefactor depending on the spatial variable alone , @xmath81 , and a scaling function simply related to @xmath82 .",
    "the exponent @xmath83 in the prefactor can be determined from known features of the quantity under concern .",
    "for instance , the expected dependence of the return probability on the spectral dimension @xmath84 of the structure , @xmath85 @xcite , entails that @xmath86 for the local probability @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the time - independence of the norm of @xmath5 yields @xmath87 , where @xmath41 is the dimensionality of the system .",
    "as to the function @xmath88 , one expects it to decay very rapidly unless , at time @xmath8 , the random walk was able to take jumps much longer than @xmath89 .",
    "the rapid decay is typical of local quantities , whereas average quantities usually exhibit an anomalous behaviour .",
    "we illustrate the origin of the slow decay by focusing on @xmath5 and its average @xmath10 , defined in eq .  .",
    "a slow decay of @xmath88 is expected when the random walk is able to take arbitrarily large jumps at arbitrarily small times .",
    "this is precisely the case of @xmath10 , since the sum in eq .",
    "includes starting sites in the vicinity of empty regions of arbitrary size .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for the local probability @xmath5 .",
    "it is indeed true that the starting site can be close to an empty region of very large linear size , say @xmath90 , so that a jump of length @xmath90 can occur at relatively early times .",
    "however , this merely affects the transient part of the dynamics . after a suitably long time @xmath91 ,",
    "the regular behaviour is recovered , since empty regions much wider than @xmath89 are far removed from the position of the random walk . for a similar reason we expect the long - time asymptotic behavior of @xmath5 to be independent of @xmath7 . indeed for @xmath89 much larger than the distance between sites @xmath92 and @xmath7 we expect that @xmath93 .",
    "the fast or slow decay of @xmath88 is mirrored by the asymptotic behaviour of the moments defined in eq .  .",
    "the rapidly decaying scaling function in the local probability indeed yields @xmath94{\\langle r_j^p(t)\\rangle } \\sim \\ell(t)\\ ] ] independent of the starting point .",
    "the expected more complex behaviour of the average moments @xmath95 when slow decay is present can be studied in the _ single - long - jump _ picture @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to assuming that the average probability can be split into two contributions , a regular , rapidly decaying part @xmath96 and an anomalous tail @xmath97 .",
    "the latter is assumed to be generated by a single jump , much larger than the characteristic length , and it is expected to give rise to a significant contribution in the region @xmath98 where the former is negligible .    in order to estimate the anomalous contribution , we have to determine the probability that the random walk takes a jump of size @xmath99 at time @xmath8 .",
    "this is proportional to the density of regions of linear size @xmath100 times the number of sites from which a random walk can reach one of such regions in a time @xmath8 . recalling that the average distance covered by the walker in a time @xmath8 is given by @xmath89 ,",
    "the sites accessible to a single region of linear size @xmath100 are enclosed in a region whose volume is proportional to @xmath101 . the density of sites corresponding to a volume of linear size @xmath89 is @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the fractal dimension discussed in section  [ structures ] . observing that the empty regions in the self similar structures thereby discussed have discrete linear sizes @xmath104 and discrete densities @xmath105 , we estimate the anomalous contribution to the average probability as @xmath106\\ ] ] where the delta function takes care of empty regions whose linear size is larger than the longest possible distance ( ballistically ) covered by the random walker in a time @xmath8 , and @xmath107 we can now analyze the generic moment of the average probability .",
    "according to its definition , the regular part of such probability results in a regular contribution , like in eq .  :",
    "the contribution from @xmath109 can be evaluated as @xmath110 performing the summations and joining the regular and anomalous contributions .",
    "we obtain @xmath111 where the @xmath112 s are time - independent coefficients and we made use of eq .  .",
    "equation   shows that the asymptotic behaviour of the generic moment of the average probability is actually more complex than that given in eq .",

    "more specifically on thin carpets ( @xmath113 ) @xmath114 whereas on fat carpets ( @xmath115 ) @xmath116    let us now turn to the scaling properties of the escape time probability .",
    "the scaling hypothesis states that @xmath73 can depend on the system size @xmath13 only through the ratio @xmath117 i.e. @xmath118 imposing the normalization @xmath119 we get @xmath120 , where we once again made use of eq .  .",
    "similar considerations apply to the transmission - related quantities introduced in section [ physical ] .",
    "the time - resolved transmission probability , eq . , is expected to obey a scaling law of the same form as eq .",
    ", @xmath121 although with different scaling function and exponent .",
    "the latter is fixed by recalling that the einstein relation connecting the growth of the characteristic length and the total transmitted intensity as a function of the linear size of the system @xcite gives @xmath122 . on the other hand , plugging eqs .   and into eq .",

    "the discrepancy between the experimental profiles and our results is very likely to be ascribed to the fact that the experimental samples are much more inhomogeneous than our lvy quasicrystals .",
    "in this paper we analyze lvy walks whose step - length distribution is characterized by correlations arising from the structural properties of the lvy quasicrystal through which the process takes place .",
    "one of the main outcomes of our work is that this correlation has a non - trivial influence over all of the properties of lvy walks we have addressed .",
    "the difference between correlated and uncorrelated lvy walks are not a peculiarity of the one - dimensional case examined in refs .",
    "@xcite , but persists in two- and three dimensions , at least as long as the correlations arise from the self - similar inhomogeneity pattern of the lvy quasicrystals hereby considered . the scaling analysis",
    "we develop shows that the dynamic exponent @xmath1 governing the asymptotic behaviour of the characteristic length of the local probability @xmath5 has a wider scope than the mean - square displacement usually employed in the description the process of ( super-)diffusion through the sample . our _ single - long - jump _ ansatz provides a very satisfactory quantitative description of the strongly anomalous asymptotic behaviour of the process emerging after averaging over all possible starting points .",
    "in order to make a more direct contact with experiments we extend our scaling analyis to escape - time probabilities , time - resolved transmission probabilities and transmission profiles .",
    "our scaling picture is indeed confirmed by extensive numeric simulations covering a significant range of sample sizes and heavy - tailed jump distributions .",
    "a further important message from our results is that lvy quasicrystals are an ideal testbed for reproducing the superdiffusive features induced by structural properties of the sample . in this respect",
    "the question naturally arises as to what extent the above scenario is robust to the introduction of disorder typical of the highly inhomogeneous structures usually invoked for the realization of correlated lvy walks @xcite .",
    "specifically , the comparison of our transmission profiles and those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that lvy quasicrystals are much more homogeneous than the lvy glass realized at _",
    "european laboratory for non - linear spectroscopy_. we are currently working at exending our analysis to structures characterized by disorder and/or a higher degree of inhomogeneity than lvy quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "while we deem these issues of utter interest , we think that lvy quasicrystals should not be regarded as a simple toy model , but as an alternate , highly controllable route to observe correlated lvy walks in engineered materials . in this perspective , the `` cleanliness '' of the samples suggested by the bell - like shape of the transmission profile in fig .",
    "[ tprof ] could even prove to be a desirable feature .",
    "indeed , in the absence of the strong inhomogeneity characterizing most of the relevant physical systems , the superdiffusive character of lvy walks could emerge more cleanly from experimental measurements .",
    "for instance a data - collapse of measured time - resolved transmission probabilities like in fig .",
