    "the existence of magnetic field associated with the intergalactic medium in clusters of galaxies is indicated by the diffuse non thermal radio emission ( radio halos ) revealed in some clusters .",

    "the properties of the coma cluster magnetic field , can be investigated through the study of the extended radiogalaxy ngc4869 ( 5c4.81 ) , located near the cluster center , completely embedded within the halo source coma c. this radio source belongs to the class of narrow angle tail ( nat ) radio sources , which represent the most extreme example of the interaction between a radio source and the intracluster medium .",

    "the radio structure consists of a faint flat spectrum core , from which two straight short jets originate .",
    "they are sharply bent at @xmath0  1  kpc from the nucleus and produce two tails wrapping each other and probably merging .",
    "this structure develops in ew for @xmath0  4 @xmath5 ( 75 kpc ) with some wide oscillations .",
    "then the tail fades progressively and shows a sharp bend to the north , which is detected only at lower frequencies ( dallacasa et al .",
    "the tail spectrum steepens progressively with the distance from the radio core , and at the source periphery it is considerably steeper ( @xmath6 , with s@xmath7 ) than that of the surrounding regions of the radio halo coma c ( giovannini et al . 1993 ) .",

    "some structure is associated with the blobs in the jets .",
    "a significant amount of polarized emission is associated with the short tail originating from the s - e jet , and the local configuration of the magnetic field seems to be circumferential ( faraday rotation at this frequency is small ) .    at 6 cm ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the fractional polarization and polarization angle are similar to those observed at 3.6 cm , with the clear evidence of rotation of the polarization angle in some regions .    at 18 cm ,",

    "the highest beginning of the tail , and in a few clumps further out .",
    "the highest fractional polarization is of @xmath010% at @xmath0 30@xmath11 from the core . at further distance , where the brightness of the tail becomes lower than 0.5 mjy / beam , the detection of polarized flux is noise limited . in this case ,",
    "an upper limit of @xmath020% can be placed to the fractional polarization . at 20.5 cm",
    "the polarized flux is lower than at 18 cm , with peaks of 7 - 8% .",
    "we note that the fractional polarization detected at 20 cm by kim et al .",
    "( 1990 ) along the tail is always below 1% , because of their observing beam ( @xmath19 ) which is much larger than the structures in polarized emission seen in our images , and therefore their data are severely affected by beam depolarization .",
    "we have derived the rotation measure ( rm ) of the source using the images at 3.6 and 6 cm .",
    "using these two wavelenghts , the maximum detectable rm without ambiguity is 1300 rad m@xmath20 .",
    "we are confident that the rm computed with these close wavelengths has no ambiguity .",
    "this was checked by producing two independent maps for the two different frequencies in the c band , i.e. 4835 and 4885 mhz .",
    "since the orientations of polarization vectors are consistent with each other within a few degrees , the @xmath21rm@xmath21 must be lower than 500 rad m@xmath20 .",
    "5 presents a grey scale image of the rm distribution . in the head region , including the nucleus , the southern blob and its short tail , we detect the most negative rm , with @xmath22rm@xmath23=243 rad m@xmath20 and with a dispersion @xmath24=87 rad m@xmath20 .",
    "this region is about 15@xmath11 ( 5 kpc ) in size , and is located at the inner region of the optical galaxy ( see the radio - optical overlay in dallacasa et al .",
    "the minimal values of the rm are found in the southern blob .",
    "we note that kim et al .",
    "( 1994 ) give for this source , referring to the head , two equally likely values of rm , 349.5@xmath256.5 and 49.2@xmath2510.5 rad m@xmath20 .",
    "the first value is roughly consistent with ours , especially considering that the head region may have been defined differently , because of the very different angular resolution .    at the beginning of the tail ,",
    "i.e. immediately after the northern jet bend , the rm increases , with an average value in the region of highest surface brightness of @xmath22rm@xmath23=44 rad m@xmath20 and with @xmath24=135 rad m@xmath20 . in the tail continuation ,",
    "the average rm becomes more negative with @xmath22rm@xmath23=197 rad m@xmath20 .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "5 that the rm shows fluctuations on small scales . following leahy ( 1984 ) , we investigate the scale on which the fluctuations in the rm occur using the function a(@xmath26 ) , defined as the rms difference in rotation between all points separated by an angle @xmath26 in the map .",
    "thus @xmath27 where @xmath17 is a position in the map and @xmath28 is a unit displacement vector ; the average is taken over all @xmath17 and all orientations of @xmath28 .",
    "we note that a(@xmath26 ) is the square root of the structure function suggested by simonetti et al .",
    "( 1984 ) . for a single value of rm with random fluctuations ,",
    "the rms difference function should increase monotonically with separation until there is no correlation , after which the value of a(@xmath26 ) should be @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the large - scale standard deviation .",
    "the function a(@xmath26 ) obtained from our data is given by the error bars in fig .",
    "the dots in the same figure represent the structure function of the rm noise map .",
    "the structure function is not influenced by the noise in the rm values .",
    "it increases up to about 2.5@xmath11 , where it shows a significant change of slope . after this size ,",
    "it flattens or increases very slowly .",
    "the behaviour of the structure function is consistent with the existence of a typical fluctuation size of 2.5@xmath18 , with the possible presence of additional fluctuations of larger scale .",
    "we note that the smallest size obtained from the structure function corresponds to the beam size , therefore possible smaller fluctuations would not be resolved .",
    "the existence of small - scale fluctuations is confirmed by the behaviour of polarization percentage in maps with increasing resolutions . in fig . 7 , we present the profile of the fractional polarization detected at 3.6 cm along the source tail in the map at full resolution ( 2.5@xmath18 , solid line ) and in a map produced with a resolution of 4@xmath18 and same cellsize ( dotted line ) .",
    "the values of the fractional polarization in the lower resolution are systematically lower , indicating significant beam depolarization and confirming the existence of structure of the linearly polarized emission on angular scales between 2.5@xmath18 and 4@xmath18    at 18 and 20.5 cm , the orientation of the polarization angle is not consistent with the higher frequency values and a @xmath31 law . in the tail ,",
    "the polarization angle is oriented mostly longitudinally , with a few oscillations on much larger scales than expected by the rm structure .",
    "since the deviations from the @xmath31 law could be due to a significant effect of beam depolarization at long wavelengths , we re - examined the 20 cm a - array data presented by dallacasa et al ( 1989 ) , to have information with the highest resolution .",
    "unfortunately , no significant polarized flux was detected with the angular resolution of 1@xmath11 , due to the noise limitation .",
    "we define as depolarization ratio between two wavelenghts @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , the value @xmath35 where m(@xmath12 ) represents the fractional polarization at the given wavelength .",
    "the depolarization ratio between 6 and 3.6 cm , computed using only the values of the polarization percentage with errors @xmath225% , is around 0.8 - 1 ( see fig . 8) , with no evidence of any trend similar to that of the rotation measure . a plot of the rotation measure versus the depolarization ratio ( fig .",
    "9 ) confirms the lack of any correlation between the two parameters . the source is strongly depolarized at 18 and 20.5 cm . in the few regions where polarized flux is detected , the depolarization ratios with respect to 3.6 cm are around 0.1 - 0.2 .",
    "laing ( 1984 ) warned about the difficulty of interpretation of the polarization data , and indicated the case of deviations from @xmath31 rotation associated with depolarization as the hardest to sort out , since the faraday effect in this case can originate both internally within the source , and in an external foreground screen .",
    "we summarize in the following the relevant arguments useful for the interpretation of polarization data .      in case",
    "that the faraday effect originates entirely within the source , burn ( 1966 ) predicts that the polarization angle will obey a @xmath31 law of rotation and that significant rotation will be accompanied by severe depolarization . assuming a simple source geometry ( slab ) , the polarization percentage at the wavelength @xmath12 , p@xmath36 , is reduced with respect to the intrinsic polarization p@xmath37 according to the formula @xmath38 while the positon angle @xmath39 rotates as @xmath31 in the range 0@xmath40 , and then changes regularly showing a `` sawtooth '' variation ( laing 1984 ) . in more realistic mixed geometries , p@xmath36 does not have zeroes and the polarization angle will obey a @xmath31 rotation over at most 90@xmath10 .      in the simplest case of faraday depth effectively constant across the beam ,",
    "the faraday effect from a screen ( single slab ) external to the source and with uniform magnetic field produces no depolarization and a rotation of the polarization angle given by @xmath41rm@xmath23 , with @xmath42 where n@xmath43 is the electron density in @xmath44 , b@xmath45 is the strength of magnetic field along the line of sight in @xmath1 g , and @xmath46 is the depth of the screen in kpc .      the existence of small scale structure of the magnetic field in an external screen is relevant to produce both rotation of the polarization angle and depolarization .",
    "the effect of a faraday screen with a tangled magnetic field has been analyzed by lawler and dennison ( 1982 ) and by tribble ( 1991 ) . in the simplest ideal case ,",
    "the screen is made of cells of uniform size , electron density and magnetic field strength , but with field orientation at random angles in each cell .",
    "the observed rm along any given line of sight will be generated by a random walk process , and the distribution of the rm results a gaussian with zero mean and variance given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the electron density in @xmath44 , b is the magnetic field strength in @xmath1 g , n is the number of cells along the line of sight and @xmath49 is the size of each cell in kpc .",
    "the depolarization produced by a faraday screen with tangled magnetic field can be approximated at a long wavelength @xmath12 by the formula suggested by tribble ( 1991 ) , which includes dependence on the uniform cell size and rm dispersion @xmath50 where @xmath17 is the angular size of each cell and @xmath51 is the size of the observing beam .      in the case of a tangled magnetic field",
    ", the value of @xmath24 can also be obtained for a more realistic gas density distribution .",
    "it has been found that the gas density in clusters of galaxies follows a hydrostatic isothermal beta model ( cavaliere and fusco - femiano 1981 ) , i.e. @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the central electron density , and @xmath54 is the core radius of the gas distribution . in this case ,",
    "kim et al .",
    "( 1991 ) found @xmath55 where m is the number of cells per core radius .",
    "for @xmath56=0.7 the previous formula becomes @xmath57",
    "the observational properties of ngc4869 derived from the polarization data can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the rm is characterized by the presence of local fluctuations , occurring on typical scales of @xmath02.5@xmath11 .",
    "moreover , it is remarkable that the rm in the head of the source is more negative than in the other regions , with the lowest values in the southern blob ; 2 .",
    "depolarization ratios at 6 cm with respect to 3.6 cm are between 0.8 and 1 , while at at 18 and 20.5 cm the source is generally much strongly depolarized ; 3 .",
    "the depolarization ratio seem not to be correlated with rm ; 4 .",
    "the orientation of the polarization angle at 18 and 20.5 cm , in the regions where significant polarized flux is detected , shows deviation from a @xmath31 law , defined using the angles observed at 3.6 and 6 cm .",
    "we note that the coma cluster lies close to the north galactic pole , therefore the effect of the interstellar medium of the milky way galaxy on the polarization is negligible .    in ngc4869 the rm distribution",
    "is not correlated with the depolarization ratio and this favours the idea that the faraday effect is mostly external to the source . in this case",
    "the deviation from the @xmath31 law at long wavelength would be due to beam depolarization .",
    "this is consistent with the existence of irregularities in the foreground screen smaller than the observing beam at 20.5 cm .",
    "the rm in the head of the source could be affected by the interstellar medium of the galaxy ngc  4869 , as already found in the radio galaxy ngc  6047 ( feretti & giovannini 1988 ) .    however , the scale of the rm fluctuations in the head is not different from that in the tail and also the depolarization of the head is very similar to that in the other source regions .",
    "therefore , we do not have a definite evidence of the existence of magnetic field associated with the interstellar medium of the galaxy . in any case , since this magnetic field does not seem to affect the dispersion of the rm values , it shoud be ordered on scales comparable to the galaxy size .",
    "we note that the southern blob in ngc  4869 exhibits a more negative rm than the northern one , and this could arise from the jet orientation .",
    "the northern jet is approaching the observer , while the southern one is receding from us ( feretti et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the existence of magnetic field associated with the coma intergalactic medium is directly deduced from the presence of the the diffuse radio halo coma c , which is permeating the central region of the coma cluster , for a total size of 25 ( giovannini et al .",
    "1993 ) , corresponding to @xmath0500 kpc .",
    "no polarization data of coma c are available to get direct information on the magnetic field structure .",
    "the equipartition magnetic field of the halo is 0.5 @xmath1 g ( giovannini et al .",
    "according to x - ray data ( hughes 1988 ) , the gas density distribution follows an hydrostatic isothermal model with central gas density @xmath53 = 3.7@xmath5810@xmath59 @xmath44 , core radius = 9.8 ( corresponding to 198 kpc ) and @xmath56 = 0.76 . according to the orbit computed by feretti et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , ngc 4869 is imbedded within the halo , and not simply projected onto it .",
    "assuming equipartition conditions for the halo , i.e. a magnetic field along the line of sight = 0.5 @xmath1 g , and that the magnetic field is completely ordered , a rotation measure @xmath21rm@xmath21 @xmath60 300 rad / m@xmath15 is implied ( equation 2 ) , constant across the source . while the value of the average rm can be different , depending on the faraday depth through the cluster , the implication of a constant value across the source is not consistent with our data , given the large detected dispersion in the values of rm .",
    "the dispersion of rm observed across ngc 4869 can be explained by assuming that the magnetic field is tangled on typical scales of the same size as the rm fluctuations , i.e. 2.5@xmath18 , corresponding to 0.85 kpc .",
    "this leads to @xmath0235 cells per cluster core radius .",
    "moreover , field reversals must take place .",
    "the rm distribution , obtained using only the values of the polarization angle with errors @xmath2210@xmath10 , gives @xmath22rm@xmath23 = 127 rad m@xmath20 , with a dispersion @xmath24=181 rad m@xmath20 . using the equation ( 6 ) , assuming a projected distance of 5@xmath5 from the cluster center",
    ", we obtain a magnetic field associated with the intergalactic medium b = 8.5 @xmath61 g , where @xmath62= h@xmath63/100 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "this value refers to the trivial case that the projected distance from the cluster center coincides with the true distance .",
    "projection effects obviously may play an important role . a displacement of ngc4869 from the cluster center also along the line of sight by about @xmath253.5@xmath5 ( see feretti et al .",
    "1990 ) , leads to an uncertainty of about @xmath251.5",
    "@xmath1 g on the value of the magnetic field .    with the assumptions of a tangled magnetic field , the expected depolarization ratios at 18 and 20.5 cm , estimated with equation ( 4 ) , are 0.08 - 0.06 , roughly consistent with the observational result .",
    "however , a faraday screen with a tangled magnetic field should produce , as noted in  5.3 , a rm distribution with zero mean , which is not the case .",
    "therefore , we have to assume a more complex scenario to explain our data .",
    "the non zero average rm could be due to the existence of a weak magnetic field component , ordered on a large scale , as suggested by taylor and perley ( 1993 ) for the source hydra a. the average rm in the tail is @xmath22rm@xmath23 = 127 rad m@xmath20 , which leads to a magnetic field component ordered on a scale of @xmath0200 kpc , with strength of b=0.1 - 0.3  @xmath1 g , depending on the location of the galaxy along the line of sight .",
    "kim et al . ( 1990 ) and kim et al . (",
    "1994 ) , in a survey of the coma cluster , obtained faraday rotation measures of 18 sources at different projected distances from the cluster center and found a significant contribution to the rm of sources seen through the cluster .",
    "the sources within 15@xmath5 from the cluster center , besides our source , are : 5c4.70 , 5c4.74 and 5c4.85 , which have rm of 47@xmath257 , 65@xmath257 and 32@xmath2510 rad m@xmath20 , respectively .",
    "these values of rm are significantly different from the average rm of the present source ngc4869 .",
    "we note , however , that 5c4.70 and 5c.74 are at more than one core radius from the cluster center , therefore we must consider different faraday depths , deriving from lower electron densities .",
    "the discrepancy between the the average rm of our source , and the value of the rm of 5c4.85 , identified with the dominant galaxy of the coma cluster , could arise from projection effects , and would therefore imply that ngc4869 is actually located beyond ngc4874",
    ". moreover , a contribution from internal origin to the rm of ngc4874 could be present .",
    "new high resolution and sensitivity observations would be needed to clarify this point .",
    "the rm value and distribution of ngc4869 can be reasonably explained assuming a two - component magnetic field , one tangled on the kpc scale , the other organized over a scale of 200 kpc .",
    "the tangled magnetic field has a strength of about 8.5@xmath251.5 @xmath1 g , while the uniform component is much weaker , about 0.2@xmath250.1 @xmath1 g .",
    "a magnetic field of several @xmath1 g , associated with the intergalactic medium of clusters of galaxies , is not surprising .",
    "the existence of cluster magnetic field is discussed in many recent papers ( ge & owen 1993 , taylor & perley 1993 , taylor et al .",
    "1994 , ge & owen 1994 ) .",
    "generally these cases refer to clusters with cooling flow , where the magnetic field is suggested to be amplified by compression and inflow ( soker & sarazin 1990 ) .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field has been observed to be up to @xmath030 @xmath1 g .",

    "we note that the ratio between the magnetic field derived from rm arguments , and the minimum equipartition value is weakly affected by the assumed value of the hubble constant .",

    "therefore , we favour the possibility that coma c is not at the equipartition .    in any case , the total energy content in coma c is not minimum , but at least 100 times larger than the minimum equipartition value .",
    "this would in turn produce a larger internal pressure , thus partly reducing the apparent imbalance between internal non - thermal pressure and external pressure of the x - ray gas .",
    "the high energy content of the radio halo coma c has important implications on the physics of this puzzling source .",
    "owing to the large value of the magnetic field , the time for synchrotron radiation losses of electrons in the halo is reduced by at least one order of magnitude , thus reinforcing the need for reacceleration processes .",
    "the energy required to sustain the radio emission from the halo is very large and the contribution of galactic wakes in supplying energy from turbolence is not enough to support the existence of coma c ( see giovannini et al .",
    "1993 ) . from the x - ray map ( briel et al . , 1992 ) , it is evident that the coma cluster is not yet relaxed.therefore the energy available from the merger process ( tribble 1993 ) of the ngc  4839 sub - group ( briel et al . ,",
    "1992 ) into the main cluster becomes very important for the energy supply of coma c ( giovannini et al .",
    ", 1993 , burns et al . , 1994 ) . since thermal and non thermal particles",
    "are mixed inside coma c , we can reasonably assume that for the same reason the coma magnetic field and relativistic particles are not yet at the equilibrium ( equipartition energy condition ) .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper are the following :    1 .",
    "the large dispersion of the rm distribution of the source ngc  4869 can be interpreted as originating from a cluster magnetic field of 8.5 @xmath1 g , tangled on scales of less than 1 kpc .",
    "large magnetic fields have been so far found in clusters showing a cooling flow .",
    "this is the first case of a large magnetic field associated with a cluster without a cooling flow .",
    "2 .   the non zero average of the rm suggests the presence of a weaker magnetic field component , of 0.2 @xmath1 g , uniform on a cluster core radius scale ( @xmath0 200 kpc ) .",
    "3 .   the value of the magnetic field derived in the coma cluster is more than one order of magnitude larger than the minimum equipartition value computed for the halo source coma c. this implies that the radio halo is likely to be out of energy equipartition and reinforces the need for reacceleration processes for the relativistic electrons radiating in coma c. the energy supply in coma c is likely to be the merger process .",
