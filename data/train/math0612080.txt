    "it is known from the work of allouche , btrma , and shallit ( see  @xcite ) that a square free sequence on 6 letters can be obtained by encoding the optimal solution to the standard hanoi towers problem on 3 pegs by an automaton .",
    "roughly speaking , given an input word which is the binary representation if the number @xmath0 , the automaton ends in one of the 6 states .",
    "these states represent the six possible moves between the three pegs and if the automaton ends in state @xmath1 , this means that the one needs to move the top disk from peg @xmath2 to peg @xmath3 in step @xmath0 of the optimal solution .",
    "the obtained sequence over the 6-letter alphabet @xmath4 is an example of an automatic sequence .",
    "we choose to work with a slightly different type of automata , which under a suitable interpretation , produce integer sequences in the output .",
    "the difference with the above model , again roughly speaking , is that not only the final state matters , but the output depends on every transition step taken during the computation and both the input and the output words are interpreted as encodings of integers .",
    "the integer sequences that can be obtained this way are called transducer integer sequences .",
    "we provide some examples that illustrate the notion of a transducer integer sequence .",
    "all provided examples are related to the hanoi towers problem on 3 pegs .    in recent years",
    ", a very fruitful line of research in group theory has led to the notion of a self - similar group  @xcite ( also known as automata groups  @xcite or state closed groups  @xcite ) .",
    "many challenging problems have been solved by using finite automata to encode groups of tree automorphisms with interesting properties , leading to solutions to outstanding problems . to name just a few ,",
    "such examples are the first grigorchuk group  @xcite , solving the problem of milnor on existence of groups of intermediate growth and the day - von neumann problem on existence of amenable but not elementary amenable groups , basilica group  @xcite , providing an example of amenable but not subexponentially amenable group , wilson groups  @xcite , solving the problem of gromov on existence of groups of non - uniform exponential growth , the realization of the lamplighter group @xmath5 by an automaton  @xcite , leading to the solution of the strong atuyah conjecture on @xmath6-betti numbers  @xcite , and the recent solution to hubbard s twisted rabbit problem in holomorphic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the geometric language and insight coming from the interpretation of the action of the automata as tree automorphisms greatly simplifies the presentation and helps in the understanding of the underlying phenomena , such as self - similarity , contraction , branching , etc ( see  @xcite for definitions , examples , and details ) .",
    "the language of finite automata has been proved extremely suitable in working with self - similarity phenomena .",
    "indeed , in the case of automatic sequences , it is known from cobham theorem  @xcite that such sequences are precisely those that are obtained as images under codings of fixed points of uniform endomorphisms ( limits of iterations of endomorphisms ) .",
    "the contracting self - similar groups have been related by nekrashevych to finite partial self - coverings of orbispaces  @xcite .    in the current article",
    "we use automata in the sense of transducers . as such",
    ", they generate self - similar groups ( or semigroups ) of tree automorphisms ( or endomorphisms ) . in the same time , the output words are interpreted as encodings of integers , thus bringing the topic closer to the topic of automatic sequences .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the concrete examples of transducer integer sequences that are exhibited here all gave high level of self - similarity and can be defined as limits of certain iterations of sequences .",
    "for @xmath7 denote @xmath8 .",

    "prefix order_. namely , we say that @xmath18 if @xmath19 is a vertex on the unique geodesic from @xmath13 to @xmath11 in @xmath9 , which is equivalent to saying that @xmath19 is a _ prefix _ of @xmath13 .",
    "a map @xmath20 is a _ tree morphism _ if it preserves the word length and the prefix relation , i.e @xmath21 for all words @xmath19 and @xmath22 over @xmath23 . in case @xmath24",
    ", morphisms are called _ endomorphisms _ and bijective endomorphisms are called _",
    "every tree morphism @xmath25 can be decomposed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a map called the _ root transformation _ of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath2 in @xmath23 , are tree morphisms called the _ sections _ of @xmath28 .",
    "the root permutation and the sections of @xmath28 are uniquely determined by the recursive relation @xmath30 which holds for every letter @xmath2 and word @xmath22 over @xmath23 .",
    "thus the sections describe the action of @xmath28 on the @xmath31 subtrees hanging below the root in @xmath32 and the root transformation @xmath33 describes the action of @xmath28 at the root .",
    "a quite efficient way of defining tree morphisms is by using finite transducers .",
    "finite @xmath31 to @xmath35 transducer _ is a 5-tuple @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a finite set of _ states _ , @xmath23 and @xmath38 are the _ input and output alphabets _ , @xmath39 is a map called the _ transition map _",

    "thus , for each state @xmath42 of @xmath40 we have @xmath48 for @xmath2 a letter in @xmath15 and @xmath22 a word over @xmath15 .",
    "when started at state @xmath42 , the transducer reads the first input letter @xmath2 , produces the first letter of the output according to the transformation @xmath49 and changes its state to @xmath50 .",
    "the state @xmath50 then handles the rest of the input and output .",
    "the states of a @xmath10-ary transducer ( transducer in which @xmath51 ) define @xmath10-ary tree endomorphisms .",
    "an invertible @xmath10-ary transducer is a transducer in which @xmath51 and the transformation @xmath49 is a permutation of @xmath15 , for each state @xmath42 in @xmath37 .",
    "the states of an invertible @xmath10-ary transducer define @xmath10-ary tree automorphisms .",
    "when @xmath52 and , for each state @xmath42 , the vertex transformation @xmath49 is injective then every state of the transducer @xmath40 is an embedding of the @xmath31-ary tree into the @xmath35-ary tree .",
    "we call such a transducer an _ injective transducer_.    the boundary @xmath53 of the @xmath10-ary tree @xmath9 consists of all infinite ( to the right ) words over @xmath15 .",
    "the boundary has a structure of an ultrametric space homeomorphic to a cantor set .",
    "the recursive definition applies to both finite and infinite words @xmath22 .",
    "the action of a state @xmath42 of a @xmath10-ary transducer on the boundary @xmath53 is by continuous maps , while the action of an invertible @xmath10-ary transducer is by isometries .",

    "there are two common ways to represent finite @xmath31 to @xmath35 transducers by labeled directed graphs such as the ones in figure  [ ah - al ] .",
    "the graph on the left represents an invertible ternary transducer , denoted @xmath54 .",
    "the vertices are the states , each state @xmath42 is labeled by its corresponding transformation ( in this case permutation ) @xmath49 , and the edges labeled by the letters from @xmath55 define the transition function @xmath56 ( for every @xmath42 in @xmath37 and @xmath2 in @xmath55 there exists an edge from @xmath42 to @xmath43 labeled by @xmath2 ) .",
    "the graph on the right represents a 3 to 2 transducer .",

    "one can easily switch back and forth between the two formats .",
    "we refer to the second form ( the one in which the output is indicated on the edges ) as the _ moore diagram _ of the automaton .",
    "consider the transducer in the right half of figure  [ at ] .",

    "the realization of the lamplighter group @xmath5 by the automaton @xmath67 was used by grigorchuk and uk  @xcite to calculate the spectrum of the markov operator on the cayley graph of @xmath5 , which then lead to the solution of strong atiyah conjecture in  @xcite .    for @xmath68 , the row @xmath0 word @xmath69 in the matrix @xmath70 ( the @xmath0-th gray code word of length @xmath12 ) is equal to @xmath71_2^r)^r$ ] , where @xmath72 denotes word reversion and",

    "we can define a variation on the notion of transducer integer sequences as sequences that can be obtained from transducers by reading the input starting from the most significant digit ( and interpreting the output as starting from the most significant digit ) .",
    "call these sequences sf transducer sequences ( for significant first ) .",
    "since the sequence of binary gray code words can be obtained by feeding the binary representations of integers , most significant digit first , into @xmath67 starting at @xmath74 , we see that the sequence a003188 of integers @xmath75 represented by the binary gray code words is a sf binary transducer sequence . on the other hand , this sequence is not a binary transducer sequence .",

    "since we want to use gray code words to describe the configurations along the way , we observe that in the first part of the geodesic from @xmath87 to @xmath88 ( corresponding to the last digit in the gray code being 0 ) the last digit in the reached configurations is @xmath2 , while in the second part ( corresponding to the last digit in the gray code being 1 ) the last digit in the reached configuration is @xmath3 .",
    "this explains the root transformations in the above decomposition .    as for the sections , in the first part of the geodesic ( last digit 0 in the gray code ) the configurations corresponding to the first @xmath98 digits describe the path from @xmath99 to @xmath100 , while in the second part ( last digit 1 in the gray code ) the configurations corresponding to the first @xmath98 digits describe the path from @xmath100 to @xmath101 in the natural order and from @xmath101 to @xmath100 in the gray code word order ( because of the flip in the second half of the gray code ) .",
