    "it has been recognized that the relation between classical and quantum integrable systems is useful for studying non - perturbative properties of supersymmetric gauge theories and the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . the ode / im correspondence @xcite provides an interesting example of this classical / quantum correspondence , which relates the spectral determinants of certain ordinary differential equations to the bethe ansatz equations in the massless limit of certain integrable models .",
    "it is an interesting problem to make a complete list of this ode / im correspondence .",
    "the ordinary differential equations for the integrable models related to classical lie algebras have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the wronskian of the solutions obeys the functional relations called the @xmath1-system , which leads to the bethe ansatz equations of the related quantum integrable system .",
    "the @xmath1-system for classical lie algebra has been reformulated in the form of the matrix valued linear differential equations @xcite , where the bethe ansatz equations of the integrable models associated with the untwisted affine lie algebra @xmath3 of a classical lie algebra @xmath4 are related to the linear differential equations associated with the langlands dual @xmath5 .    the ode / im correspondence has been generalized to massive integrable models .",
    "it was found that for the classical sinh - gordon equation modified by a conformal transformation , the spectral problem for the associated linear problem leads to the functional relations of the quantum sine - gordon model @xcite . by taking the conformal limit",
    ", it reduces to the ode / im correspondence for the schrdinger type differential equation @xcite .",
    "recently the massive ode / im correspondence has been generalized to a class of modified affine toda field equations @xcite . in particular , locke and",
    "one of the present authors studied the modified affine toda equations for affine lie algebra @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is an untwisted affine lie algebra including exceptional type @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that from their associated linear problems one obtains the @xmath1-system which leads to the bethe ansatz equations for the affine lie algebra @xmath8 .",
    "it would be an interesting problem to explore the modified affine toda field equation with an affine lie algebra @xmath8 which is not of the form of the langlands dual of an untwisted one , where the corresponding integrable models are not identified yet . in this paper",

    "the equation of motion of strings is described by the @xmath0 affine toda field equation modified by the conformal transformation .",
    "the stokes problem of the associated linear system determines the functional equations for the cross - rations of external momenta .",
    "these functional relations are known to be the same as the y - system of the homogeneous sine - gordon model @xcite and the free energy of the y - system determines the area of the minimal surface .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to apply the massive ode / im correspondence to the modified @xmath0 affine toda field equation and to investigate the functional relations for the stokes coefficients of the linear problem , which include the bethe ansatz equations , the t - q relations , the t - system and the y - system .",

    "we are interested in the special class of solutions of ( [ eq : mafe1 ] ) , which satisfy the periodicity condition @xmath48 and the boundary conditions at infinity and the origin of the complex plane : @xmath49 where we have introduced the polar coordinate @xmath50 by @xmath51 and and @xmath52 is a 2-vector satisfying @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) . due to the special form ( [ eq : pz1 ] ) of @xmath34 , ( [ eq : mafe1 ] ) and the linear problem are invariant under the symanzik rotation @xmath55 for an integer @xmath56 .",

    "one has two eigenvalues with the largest real part and the corresponding solutions in @xmath68 are not subdominant along the real axis .",
    "so we introduce the @xmath95-rotated symanzik solution @xmath96 .",
    "this is a solution of the linear problem with the @xmath95-rotated connection @xmath97 and @xmath98 which is obtained by replacing @xmath99 in ( [ eq : conn1 ] ) .",

    "the inclusion maps between the modules induce the relation between the small solutions , which is called the @xmath1-system @xcite .",
    "for example , we consider the inclusion map @xmath112 by these maps the highest weight state @xmath113 is mapped to @xmath114 and @xmath115 to @xmath116 .",

    "the @xmath1-system in the previous section has been obtained by investigating the asymptotic solution in a single stokes sector , @xmath136 for example .",
    "now we consider the solutions of the linear problem in the whole complex plane .",
    "we focus on @xmath74 because this is the minimal dimensional representation and the solution in the vector representation can be constructed via the inclusion map @xmath137 .",
    "since we are considering a @xmath138 spinor , it is natural to introduce the charge conjugation . associated with the linear problem ( [ eq : linear1 ] ) in the spinor representation , we define the transposed linear problem : @xmath139 the solution @xmath140 of these equations are related to @xmath141 by the charge conjugation : @xmath142 where @xmath143 this is a @xmath144 symmetry of the linear problem .",

    "one can choose @xmath160 as a basis of the solutions .",
    "we normalize the solution @xmath161 such that @xmath162 by choosing the normalization constant @xmath163 in ( [ eq : subdom1 ] ) as @xmath164 . from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath161 and @xmath165 at large @xmath79 , we find @xmath166 and @xmath167 . then from the condition ( [ eq : nor1 ] ) we find @xmath168 we write it in the form @xmath169 .",
