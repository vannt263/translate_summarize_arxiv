    "there has been a growing body of evidence that ( in some cases ) the cauchy horizon is classically stable to linear and even non - linear time dependent perturbations .",
    "thus , black hole - de sitter space - times can serve as counter - examples of the strong censorship hypothesis ( see e.g. @xcite for a detailed discussion and number of references ) .",
    "recently , exact multi - black - hole solutions in asymptotically de sitter universe have been discovered and discussed @xcite .",
    "these space - times describe systems of an arbitrary number of `` extremally charged '' black holes .",

    "in particular , collisions of extreme black holes and the cosmic censorship hypothesis have been studied within this framework .",
    "there are also exact models of black - hole formation in the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath0 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the robinson - trautman type @xmath4 spacetimes with @xmath0 converge asymptotically to a corresponding spherically symmetric schwarzschild(anti- ) de  sitter solution for large retarded times ( i.e. , near the future event horizon ) with the initial `` perturbation '' being radiated away in gravitational waves . in general , the extension of these space - times across the event horizon can only be made with a finite degree of smoothness .",
    "however , in the extreme case the horizon is smooth but nonanalytic @xcite .",
    "some of the results in the above mentioned papers suggest that some properties of extreme black holes are often qualitatively different from those of generic ones .",
    "this is the primary motivation of our work in which we concentrate on the solution describing _ extreme _ schwarzschild  de sitter black holes ; we investigate and systematically summarize its properties .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the extreme schwarzschild  de sitter space - time . in section 3 ,",
    "we present kruskal - type null coordinates and we rigorously construct the conformal diagram using a proper conformal factor .",

    "a complete investigation of all geodesics ( null , timelike , and spacelike ) in the extreme schwarzschild  de sitter space - time is presented . in section 7 , relative motions described by the equation of geodesic deviation are studied .",
    "section 8 is devoted to an analysis of interesting `` asymptotic points '' in the space - time , and in section 9 the redshift viewed by observers approaching these points is calculated .",

    "the global structure of the extreme schwarzschild  de sitter space - time has already been described , for example in @xcite , @xcite and elsewhere . however , as far as we know , the corresponding conformal diagram has not yet been constructed rigorously .",
