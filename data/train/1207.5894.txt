    "coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers observe sunlight that has been thomson scattered off free electrons in the corona and solar wind .",
    "this potential was realized with the invention of the coronagraph @xcite , and solar wind transients such as coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) have been observed with ground - based coronagraphs since the 1950s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these were accompanied by spacecraft coronagraphs in the 1970s ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the coronagraph legacy continues to this day .",
    "the physics by which this light is scattered are well established , with the original theory predating the discovery of the electron @xcite .",
    "other important developments include the work of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter is the publication most commonly referred to when discussing thomson scattering theory with regard to white light observations .",
    "the utility of this theory to identify physical properties ( such as mass ) in solar wind transient phenomena ( such as cmes ) observed by coronagraphs is well known .",
    "early works include @xcite ; and @xcite .    in the last decade , coronagraphs have been accompanied by another type of white light observer .",
    "heliospheric imagers , first smei @xcite and then the _ _ stereo/__his @xcite ,",
    "observe thomson scattered light at much larger angles ( @xmath0 ) from the sun , and their ability to track transients such as cmes has been demonstrated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all current heliospheric imagers observe unpolarized thomson scattered sunlight , in part because only recently @xcite has it become clear that the bright stellar background could be subtracted with sufficient precision for quantitative analysis of the faint thomson - scattered signal from an imaging instrument .",
    "although heliospheric imagers use the same scattering physics as coronagraphs , the wide viewing angle leads to significantly different geometry and requires different treatment .",
    "for example , thomson scattering becomes much simpler in the heliospheric case because the sun can be treated as a near - point source , eliminating the need to carry van de hulst coefficients @xcite when performing scattering / radiance calculations .",
    "more immediately , coronagraphs are often assumed to operate near the sky plane , but the relevant figure for a wide - field imager is the `` thomson surface '' defined by the locus of the point of closest approach to the sun of each line of sight from the observer . that locus is the sphere with diameter passing between the sun and the observer @xcite .",
    "paper i of this series @xcite covered the applied theory of thomson scattering to describe the relationship between this broad - field geometry , illumination , and scattering efficiency in unpolarized heliospheric imaging , and demonstrates that a fortuitous cancellation yields a broad plateau ( the `` thomson plateau '' ) of nearly uniform radiance sensitivity to electron density .    in the present paper , ii of a planned series of three , we explore the consequences of thomson scattering theory for polarized light in the heliospheric context , and discuss scientific applications of the theory .",
    "in particular , we invert the scattering equations analytically to show how polarized thomson scattering imagery can be used to determine the three - dimensional location of individual small heliospheric features , without the front / back ambiguity present in similar efforts with coronagraphs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and explore analytically the limits of the technique .",
    "further , we demonstrate via a simple forward model that the polarization signal remains present even for large features that whose position can not be solved for analytically . we also discuss the stability of the polarization signal from the zodiacal light and its implications for measuring the absolute radiance , rather than merely feature - excess radiance , of thomson scattered light from heliospheric electrons .",
    "polarization measurement of thomson scattered light observation has existed since the dawn of the coronagraph @xcite and has been used for three dimensional analysis of cmes since shortly after their discovery ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the _ skylab _ coronagraph , _ solwind _ , c / p on board _ smm , _ and lasco on board _ soho _ all had polarizing capabilities . perhaps because polarized coronagraph imagery , requiring photometry , is harder to work with than is unpolarized imagery ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has not been fully exploited in the spaceflight context although recent work @xcite may indicate a renaissance of polarized image exploitation in the corona .",
    "polarized detection of thomson scattered light from cmes at wide angles from the sun dates back much farther than direct heliospheric imaging cameras such as smei and _ stereo_/hi .",
    "the helios spacecraft photometers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were used both to characterize the zodiacal light ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also to detect heliospheric structures via time - domain analysis of the polarized intensity signal measured by three photometers on the spinning spacecraft @xcite .",
    "hardware on board _ helios _ sorted detected photon events into accumulator bins based on their temporal phase relative to the 1 hz spacecraft spin .",
    "these bins were accumulated to yield sky brightnesses , including polarization and color signals , on time scales of several hours .",
    "these angularly separated photometric signals were used to generate synoptic maps of the thomson scattering surface brightness of the solar wind @xcite , to estimate cme mass @xcite , and even to constrain coarse tomographic reconstructions of the three dimensional structure of the heliosphere @xcite .    in section [ sec : elementary ] , below , we discuss heliospheric imaging with polarized light in the same context as we have previously with unpolarized light ( paper i : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including : basic theory ; importance of the thomson surface ; a summary description of instrument sensitivity , detectability , and signal - to - noise ; and discussion of two key scientific applications of polarized imaging .",
    "section [ sec : forward - modeling - of ] moves to simulations of these effects applied to non - infinitesimal features including cmes and corotating interaction regions ( cirs ) . in section [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the applied theoretical results and their implications for future missions .",
    "thomson scattering theory has been covered at great length by many authors .",
    "finding the polarized radiance of a plasma illuminated by a distributed object that subtends significant solid angle from the scatter point ( e.g. a solar coronal feature only a few solar radii above the photosphere ) requires geometrical integrals over the range of solid angles of the incoming light , and is even more complicated in the general case than is the same calculation for unpolarized light .",
    "the problem has been treated in this general case by numerous authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as part of coronagraphic image intepretation .",
    "but in the heliospheric case the sun may be treated as a small object , greatly simplifying the theory ( howard &  tappin 2009 ; paper i ) . here",
    ", we re - derive the polarized radiance formulae in this simpler case , and outline the consequences of its form for different aspects of heliospheric imaging through polarizers .          the elementary unpolarized theory of thomson scattering begins with the differential scattering cross - section for unpolarized light @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the differential cross section for a single electron to scatter unpolarized light into the solid angle @xmath3 , @xmath4 is half the square of the classical electron radius , and @xmath5 is the angle of scatter , with @xmath6 for forward scatter .",
    "thomson scattering is absorption and re - radiation ( in a dipole pattern ) of incident electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the electromagnetic waves can be resolved into two polarized intensity or radiance components : @xmath7or @xmath8 of light polarized perpendicular to the plane of scatter , and @xmath9 or @xmath10 of light polarized in the plane of scatter . in the circularly symmetric solar case @xmath8",
    "is also called the _",
    "tangential _ component and @xmath10 is also called the _ radial _ component . in local observing",
    "coordinates with the y axis aligned radially outward from the sun , the quantity @xmath11 is the familiar `` q '' stokes parameter .",
    "the two components are scattered quite differently .",
    "the perpendicular component is scattered independently of @xmath5 , because of the circular symmetry of dipole radiation : @xmath12 the factor of 2 reflects the fact that the perpendicular polarization is only half of the original unpolarized beam  while we are now considering a beam that is fully plane polarized perpendicular to the plane of scatter . for the parallel component , the electric field",
    "is simply projected with @xmath13 , so that the overall intensity is scaled by @xmath14 : @xmath15 and it should be clear that equation ( [ eq : dsdw - unpolarized ] ) is simply the average of equations ( [ eq : dsdw - perp ] ) and ( [ eq : dsdw - parallel ] ) .",
    "coronagraphic and heliospheric imagery viewed through a radial / tangential polarizer are thus quite different from the same imagery viewed with no polarizing optics .",
    "it is most convenient to resolve observed radiance features into an unpolarized radiance @xmath16 and an `` excess polarized radiance '' @xmath17 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "because the propagators are linear , there is a `` _ _ pb _ _ scattering cross - section '' made from the difference between the two polarized cross sections just as the unpolarized cross - section is made from their sums : @xmath18    as in paper i , we treat the sun as a small object for the current heliospheric case .",
    "this greatly simplifies the integral formulation developed by earlier authors .",
    "the differential radiance is simply proportional to the mean solar radiance and the sun s apparent size from the point of scatter : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the radius and mean radiance of the sun , @xmath22 is distance along a hypothetical line of sight , and @xmath23 is surface area normal to that line of sight .",
    "the only difference between the polarized radiance @xmath24 and the radiance @xmath25 is that the @xmath26 term from equations  ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of paper i becomes the @xmath27 term in our equations ( [ eq : dsdw - pb ] ) and ( [ eq : db ] ) .",
    "separating out the @xmath5-dependent portion of @xmath28 echoes equation ( 6 ) of paper i : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is elongation angle , @xmath31 is distance along a line of sight , @xmath32 is an azimuthal angle around the sun in the celestial sphere , and @xmath33 is the numerical electron density across space .",
    "the in - plane geometrical values are summarized in figure [ fig : observing - diagram - showing ] .",
    "the functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 serve to isolate the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath24 .",
    "those last two terms are given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath34 includes the @xmath5-independent ( and hence @xmath31-independent ) parts of @xmath28 , the geometric factor @xmath35 includes the @xmath5-dependent parts and again the geometric quantities are as summarized in figure [ fig : observing - diagram - showing ] .",
    "@xmath35 includes both illumination and scatter dependence on @xmath5 , and is sharply peaked around @xmath38 .",
    "this is in contrast to the unpolarized geometric factor @xmath39 , discussed in paper i , which has an extraordinarily broad peak around @xmath38 , superosculating the @xmath40 line there .",
    "figure [ fig : g - vs - gp ] shows the relationship between @xmath39 and @xmath35 .",
    "this relationship between the b and pb signals variance with angle has been known over 60 years @xcite and has been used to interpret coronagraph observations since at least the time of _ skylab _ ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far , it has neither been well explored nor exploited in the wide - field ( heliospheric ) case , which is considerably different from the coronagraph case ( as described in paper i ) .",
    "the two curves @xmath39 and @xmath35 are tangent at @xmath38 because at @xmath41 the thomson scattered light is fully polarized ",
    "so @xmath42 at that scattering angle .",
    "the second derivative of @xmath35 is strongly negative at the peak , so that _ in _ pb _ measurements there is no thomson plateau _ , and _ pb _ measurements are most sensitive to material close to the thomson surface ( ts ) . in particular , _ pb _ images are moderately well localized to the vicinity of the ts .",
    "considering the scattering efficiency factors in @xmath39 and @xmath35 independently of illumination : the scattering efficiency for unpolarized radiance @xmath25 is minimized on the thomson surface , while the `` scattering '' effiency for excess polarized radiance @xmath24 is maximized on the thomson surface .",
    "the polarized excess intensity ( _ pi _ ) of a unit volume of material is the polarized radiance integrated over its apparent size . carrying out the same operations as for equation ( 9 ) of paper i yields : @xmath43dn_{e}.\\label{eq : pi}\\ ] ] both @xmath28 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 are plotted at constant elongation @xmath30 and at constant heliocentric distance @xmath47 in figure [ fig : thomson - scattering - effects ] , versus the out - of - sky - plane angle ( or `` sky angle '' ) @xmath48 ( with the understanding from figure [ fig : observing - diagram - showing ] that @xmath49 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : thomson - scattering - effects ] is directly comparable to figure 5 of paper i. the location of the ts is marked with a single vertical bar across each line - of - sight plot .",
    "the @xmath24-vs-@xmath48 curve ( middle left ) echoes the sharpness of the @xmath35 geometric function in figure [ fig : g - vs - gp ] . unlike the unpolarized radiance @xmath25",
    ", there is no local minimum of @xmath24 at the ts in the constant-@xmath47 case ( upper right ) .    also unlike the unpolarized case",
    ", @xmath50 has a local maximum for a given size of feature for elongation angles smaller than 30 ( green dashed curve at lower left ) . at wide elongation angles , perspective effects overwhelm the thomson scattering and illumination efects , and there is no local maximum . in all cases ,",
    "perspective effects skew the location of greatest polarized intensity away from the ts , although the greatest polarized radiance occurs on the ts .",
    "the 20 elongation curve , at lower left , for example , shows a peak excess polarized intensity about 10 closer to the observer than is the ts . at constant @xmath47 ,",
    "there is a local maximum in excess polarized intensity across @xmath5 at each possible exit angle .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the unpolarized case explored in paper i , in which we showed that there is no local maximum in intensity for features with small apparent size .",
    "as discussed in paper i , detectability of features visible in _ @xmath24 _ depends not on their radiance but on their _ _ total intensity ( in this case , total polarized intensity ) above a noise floor . because @xmath24 and @xmath50 are compound measurements ( they are formed from the difference between two radiances or intensities , respectively ) , the intrinsic photon noise for @xmath50 is greater than for a single measurement of _ @xmath7 _ or @xmath9 .",
    "but in the heliospheric case , intrinsic photonic noise in the intensity of the desired thomson scattered feature is small compared to the large background ( and its associated photon and other noise sources ) that must be subtracted . even outside the brighter regions of the zodiacal light and the galaxy ,",
    "the surface brightness is dominated by the starfield ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "following the analysis in paper i , we note that the background noise against which features are measured is a random variable with approximately constant distribution , with an approximately constant number of samples per unit solid angle on the celestial sphere .",
    "this means that @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the noise against which a feature is to be compared , @xmath53 is the solid angle subtended by it , and @xmath54 is an instrument - dependent factor .",
    "it is thus possible to calculate _ a priori _ how the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) varies with geometry for any small visual feature , up to a normalization constant .",
    "figure [ fig : signal - to - noise - ratio - variation ] shows how the ratio varies for different types of feature and different types of angular comparison .",
    "the left two panels show line - of - sight comparison and the right two panels show constant - radius comparison , as in figure [ fig : thomson - scattering - effects ] .",
    "the top two panels show behavior of a feature with constant volume and mass as it propagates out from the sun , and the bottom two panels show the behavior of a self - similarly expanding feature of constant mass as it propagates outward , i.e. a feature that retains its shape but scales to larger size with propagation as described by @xcite .",
    "real solar wind features typically fall between these two cases .",
    "the self - similar expansion with constant mass is pessimistic far from the sun as most features expand laterally but not radially as they propagate ; and many dense features also accumulate mass through snowplow effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , the constant - volume expansion is somewhat optimistic far from the sun as most features expand laterally to occupy approximately constant solid angle relative to the sun .",
    "because noise analysis is strongly dependent on specifics of the instrument used to measure a signal , we confine ourselves ( as in paper i ) to describing only _ variation _ of the snr of a hypothetical feature across location in the heliosphere , _",
    "ceteris paribus_. polarization measurements have additional instrument - dependent noise sources that must be considered in addition to the basics of aperture and integration time for an unpolarized measurement .",
    "in particular , an instrument that collects individual polarized signals in sequence through a single polarizer will incur noise from evolution of the signal and background between the two exposures , while instruments that rapidly modulate or that use dual - beam polarization do not , but may incur other sources of noise .",
    "these noise sources are dependent on the specific technology and instrument used to detect polarization , and generally increase the denominator of the snr ; but they do not affect the form of the variation of snr with feature - sun distance .    because of the instrument - dependence of the absolute snr , we normalized the curves in figure [ fig : signal - to - noise - ratio - variation ] to be near unity , to display how the ratio varies for a particular class of feature .",
    "the normalization constants for figure [ fig : signal - to - noise - ratio - variation ] are numerically the same as the normalization constants we used in the analogous figure for unpolarized signal ( figure 6 of paper i ) , and the figures may therefore be compared directly although the maximum value in figure [ fig : signal - to - noise - ratio - variation ] is not always unity .",
    "polarized snr is dominated by the interplay of the inefficiency of the _ pb _ scattering far from the thomson surface , and the proximity effect in intensity as the feature approaches the observer .",
    "the right - hand plots show , unsurprisingly , that earth - directed features are not clearly visible from earth in @xmath24 alone .",
    "features close to earth are more readily detectable but that is a perspective effect : the peaks in snr at 60 - 80 elongation in all the plots in figure [ fig : signal - to - noise - ratio - variation ] are due to large apparent - size effects in infinitesimal features ; the snr of real features will thus roll off when the feature - observer distance @xmath55 shrinks to the same order as the size of the feature itself : at smaller values of @xmath55 , the small - apparent - feature approximation @xmath56 no longer holds .",
    "combining polarized and unpolarized imagery , with sufficient snr , enables location of features in 3-d with a single polarized image pair .",
    "this technique has been explored extensively in coronagraphs in recent years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we develop the theory in the slightly different case of wide - field heliospheric imaging .",
    "the ratio @xmath57 ( and its feature - averaged equivalent , @xmath58 for a whole feature ) is just the ratio of the corresponding geometric factors : @xmath59 which has solutions : @xmath60 or , giving the sky angle @xmath48 in terms of observed elongation angle @xmath30 and @xmath57 : @xmath61 the relationship between @xmath48 and @xmath57 is plotted in figure [ fig : pb / b - ratio ] for two different features exiting the sun at @xmath62 ( near the plane of the sky ; green in the figure ) and @xmath48=80 ( nearly directly at the observer ; purple in the figure ) .",
    "the two branches are on opposite sides of the thomson surface , equally displaced from it along the line of sight . in the coronagraphic case , the two branches represent a permanent ambiguity , because @xmath30 is nearly zero and therefore the ts is in the plane of the sky . in the heliospheric case , the curvature of the ts breaks the front / back asymmetry . while any one heliospheric measurement of @xmath57 can not identify which branch is occupied by a given feature , time series of observations can : on the occupied branch , the trajectory is approximately inertial and radial from the sun , while on the opposite branch the inferred `` ghost trajectory '' includes large lateral accelerations that are reflected in the curved path in figure [ fig : two - feature - trajectories ] .",
    "the ratio of @xmath24 to @xmath25 in small features varies with sky angle @xmath48 , and is plotted for several elongation angles ( dashed / dotted curves ) .",
    "overplotted : two example features exit the sun at @xmath62 ( green ; nearly in the plane of the sky ) and @xmath63 ( purple ; just missing the observer ) , passing through elongation angles between 20 and 90 . at each elongation",
    ", the feature s @xmath57 ratio corresponds to either the real @xmath48 ( bold vertical lines with solid circles ) or to a ghost location @xmath64 that varies with elongation ( horizontally extended lines with open circles ) , which is dynamically implausible",
    ". see figure [ fig : two - feature - trajectories ] for a sketch.,width=288 ]        location of features in three dimensions requires propagating noise in the photometry through the @xmath65-to-@xmath48 conversion process",
    ". neglecting instrumental noise sources , the noise level of the @xmath65 measurement may be calculated by simple quadrature combination of the @xmath50 and _ i _ noise sources . treating the noise in first order",
    ", the feature as compact and uniform - radiance , and the two measurements ( and noise samples ) as independent , gives : @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes addition in quadrature .",
    "the resulting noise term can then be propagated through equation ( [ eq:3d - sol-2 ] ) to identify error in @xmath48 determination for any given noise level in the images .",
    "the two terms added in quadrature are the snrs of the @xmath50 and @xmath68 measurements , respectively .",
    "this treatment glosses over the fact that @xmath50 is a compound measurement and hence incurs two samples of the background noise , but that makes no difference because : ( a ) the photon noise in the signal itself is considered to be negligible compared to that of the background ; and ( b ) if @xmath50 and @xmath68 are assembled from the sum and difference of two intensities obtained through polarizers ( or through one rotating polarizer ) , there are still only two samples of the background photon noise to be considered .",
    "to understand the behavior of actual 3-d interpretation , we work from the perspective of trying to determine the position of a particular feature in radial motion , whose total intensity is measured with a given snr in the unpolarized channel .",
    "figure [ fig : inferred - sky - angle ] shows calculated position of an ensemble of five small features with moderate snr , using direct measurement of the @xmath58 intensity ratio .",
    "two of the features in figure [ fig : inferred - sky - angle ] correspond to the two features followed by figures [ fig : pb / b - ratio ] and [ fig : two - feature - trajectories ] .",
    "all of the features were treated as self - similarly expanding , with an average snr across each of the two polarized channels of 10 , 30 , and 100 at 0.8 au from the sun .",
    "the three snrs yield three sets of error bars on the inferred value of @xmath48 ; these error bars are represented with the nested semitransparent curves around each @xmath48 trace . to find the snr at each value of @xmath47",
    ", we used the same formulae as for figure [ fig : signal - to - noise - ratio - variation ] ( and for the @xmath68 measurement using the formulae for figure 6 of paper i ) .",
    "for example , following the green trace we observe that a feature leaving the sun at @xmath69 that happens to have a snr of 10 at elongation @xmath70 can be determined from a single @xmath58 measurement to have @xmath48 either between 15 and 25 , or between @xmath71 and 73 . the same feature with an snr of 30 or 100",
    "has similar inferred locations but tighter error bars .",
    "the shapes of the measurement loci in figure [ fig : inferred - sky - angle ] are dominated by the two branches of the @xmath48 calculation in equation ( [ eq:3d - sol-2 ] ) . since the features propagate radially , the correct branch yields @xmath48 determinations that are constant as the feature propagates outward through different elongations , while the ghost trajectory ( figure [ fig : two - feature - trajectories ] ) yields rapidly changing @xmath48 angles versus elongation @xmath30 as the feature popagates .",
    "the intersection of the two branches occurs at the ts , which is marked with a dashed black line .",
    "the plot thickens there , primarily because the @xmath57 ratio is independent of @xmath48 at the ts .",
    "the two branches are symmetric about the thomson surface because of the symmetry of the @xmath39 and @xmath35 functions around @xmath38 ( figure [ fig : g - vs - gp ] ) .    all of the features in figure [ fig : inferred - sky - angle ] show greatly increased uncertainty toward the right of the plot , reflecting the fact that the feature grows both fainter and farther from the observer as it propagates away from the sun .",
    "the @xmath48=0 curve , in particular , has error bars that grow to over @xmath72 around the true measurement at around @xmath7360 , as the snr drops below unity : in that geometry , the feature is 2 au from the sun and 2.2 au from the observer .",
    "the feature in figure [ fig : inferred - sky - angle ] with the least uncertainty is at @xmath74 , headed nearly directly toward the observer . for that geometry ,",
    "perspective effects oppose the illumination effects ( though do not exactly cancel them ) through the mid portion of the trajectory .",
    "hence , the snr remains high throughout the @xmath74 trajectory , and the error bars remain small except for the intrinsic uncertainty near the ts .",
    "the error bar shape is dominated by the computed snr of the feature : brighter , more compact features yield lower error bars , and fainter , more diffuse features yield larger ones .",
    "in particular , we have used self - similar expansion with constant @xmath75 ( total electron count ) in the feature to scale the error bars as the features propagate outward ; this approach may be slightly pessimistic on the right - hand side of the plot when compared to actual feature behavior , as discussed in section [ sub : signal - to - noise ] .",
    "real polarizing instruments may be subject to additional noise sources that are more complex than the simple model we have used .",
    "calibration errors between the two channels would introduce noise that scales with the background and behaves functionally the same as the the noise calculations we have used , and therefore do not affect figure [ fig : inferred - sky - angle ] .",
    "simultaneity errors could arise in instruments that measure the two signals at slightly different times .",
    "these types of error yield noise that is directly proportional to the signal being measured and inversely proportional to the time scale of its evolution , and therefore they would soften the curves in figure [ fig : inferred - sky - angle ] , by fading with distance from the sun even as the main noise source ( background ) increases with feature size .    we conclude that @xmath57 measurement of individual features excess radiance over background could be used to infer absolute exit angle from the sun with precision of a few degrees of angle , with snr values that are achievable with current instruments in @xmath25 alone ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "while any one image yields ambiguous results with two branches , time series of data reveal which of the two branches is the correct one . near the ts ,",
    "such measurements are very imprecise because the slope of @xmath57 with respect to the sky angle @xmath48 is near zero - but radially propagating features necessarily spend time both near and far from the thomson surface .",
    "those events of primary interest to space weather prediction  those with @xmath48 close to @xmath41  yield the most precise measurements of @xmath48 , making @xmath57 measurements particularly interesting for this application .    this analytic result applies only to _ small _ features - i.e. those for which the feature s characteristic length is negligible compared to the distances to the sun and observer , and which may therefore be treated as point sources .",

    "the background is a combination of stray light from within the instrument itself , the unpolarized starfield , and the @xmath77 corona , which ranges from @xmath79 to @xmath80 at elongations of interest to inner heliospheric solar wind studies in the plane of the ecliptic .",
    "the zodiacal light dominates the sky background by photon count , and is polarized by up to 20% with a pole - to - ecliptic radiance variation of about @xmath81 at 90 elongation from the sun ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , there is a background @xmath24 signal of order a few @xmath82 at moderate elongations from the sun , compared to the thomson - scattering radiance of a few @xmath83 in typical solar wind features .",
    "thus , even @xmath24 measurements require modeling of the diffuse background , just as do direct @xmath25 measurements : individual constructed measurements include a broad diffuse background that must be subtracted from the data to yield `` feature - excess '' radiance in individual features .",
    "even with the presence of persistent diffuse background , @xmath24 affords techniques for indirect or ongoing - calibration methods to improve the modeled background , which could permit detection of absolute thomson radiance based on the improved modeling .",
    "in particular , the _ helios _ probes found that the zodiacal light is extraordinarily stable across solar wind condition @xcite and even across the whole solar cycle .",
    "@xcite conclude that the secular variation of the zodiacal light radiance is at most of order 1% ( limited by the longevity of the _ helios _ photocells ) with similarly stable polarization properties .",
    "this is useful because , even with as much as 1% long - term variation of unpolarized radiance in the zodiacal light , the stable polarization properties can be used to reduce the variation by another 1 - 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "hence , once well characterized with a particular instrument , a zodiacal light model may be used to produce a stable zero - point for @xmath24 measurements of thomson scattering at the few @xmath84 level for the life of that instrument .",
    "other types of wide - field unpolarized background are present in low - earth orbit @xcite , including high altitude orbital speed ram airglow and high altitude aurora @xcite .",
    "both effects are thought to be unpolarized as the mechanism for each is direct atomic line emission , though to our knowledge neither has been tested .",
    "the aurora , as measured by smei , is comparable to the zodiacal light when observed but is not universally present .",
    "the airglow is universal at lower altitudes than that of smei , and 3 - 4 orders of magnitude fainter than the zodiacal light at the 570 km altitude of the hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "we conclude that polarization can remove and/or stabilize at least some important background effects , affording long - term remote measurement of absolute density in the solar wind once a sufficient baseline of measurements is made .",
    "while the dominant steady diffuse light source ( the zodiacal light ) is slightly polarized , it has been measured to be remarkably constant in both intensity and degree of polarization ; and the dominant variable diffuse light sources in low - earth orbit ( aurora and ram airglow ) are thought to be unpolarized and hence not to affect absolute pb measurements , but have not yet been characterized to the precision required for such measurements .",
    "given recent successes with separation of the heliospheric thomson signal from f corona and stellar background based entirely on image morphology @xcite and the difference in image morphology between airglow and the k corona , it is plausible that such measurements could be made even if these terms prove to be variably polarized .",
    "in addition to these non - thomson - scattering background signals , there is a thomson - scattering background to any particular feature under observation , because the heliosphere and corona are optically thin .",
    "just as in the corona , heliospheric cmes and other individual bright features can be many times brighter than the rest of the thomson - scattered heliospheric signal in unpolarized light @xcite , and the thomson background can be neglected for these features ; but thomson - scattered background is important to analysis of faint features , just as it is in coronagraph data .",
    "in order to gain a ready appreciation of the differences between how solar wind disturbances appear in total power and polarized radiance , we present here some simple simulations of solar wind features to approximate the qualitative behavior of the polarization signal from features whose extent is large . the intent of these simulations is to reveal how section  [ sec : elementary - polarized - theory ] changes when the features are not small - i.e. when integration , rather than simple proportional scaling , is required . the @xmath25 and @xmath24 signals from large structures with nontrivial geometry contain contributions from many different @xmath48 angles along the line of sight , and therefore do not follow the simple inversion in figure [ fig : inferred - sky - angle ] .",
    "we use the simplest possible simulations to reproduce the gross morphology of several typical heliospheric structures to highlight how the overall feature shape influences the polarization signal .",
    "quantitative analysis of more realistically simulated large scale features is presented in paper iii @xcite .",
    "we used the generation codes of the tappin - howard model @xcite to compute synthetic sky maps for a number of idealized disturbances .",
    "the th model is a code that extracts 3-d parameters of cmes by fitting simple geometric models to the evolution of the cmes as they propagate .",
    "briefly , a model homogeneous solar wind density is assumed and the thomson scattering formulae are integrated in a spherical grid .",
    "disturbances are added by multiplying the relevant cells in the grid by an enhancement factor .",
    "these can be bent shells that simulate cmes @xcite , or spiral structures representing corotating interaction regions ( cirs ) . for the purposes of this study , to simplify comparison",
    ", we only consider ecliptic plane cuts through those maps .      ) , while the right column ( panels e - h ) shows the case where @xmath85 .",
    "the top row ( a and e ) shows the locations at which the transient radiance was computed : each color corresponds to a different radius ; the dashed lines show the central axis of the transient and the sun - observer line .",
    "the second row ( b and f ) shows the radiance excess as a function of elongation for each radius : the total power is solid ; polarized power is dashed ; the overbars indicate the elongation ranges within which the line of sight cuts the thomson surface inside the transient .",
    "the third row ( c and g ) shows the ratio of feature excess _",
    "pb _ to feature excess _",
    "b _ as a function of elongation .",
    "the fourth and final row ( d and h ) shows the ratios of total @xmath24 to @xmath25 at the feature location ( without background subtraction ) . ]",
    "the first disturbance considered was a small arc - shaped transient with a thickness of 0.1  au , and a cone angle of 6 ( 12 total extent ) in latitude and longitude , and an enhancment factor of 5 above the ambient solar wind density .",
    "the enhancement factor is typical of large cmes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radiance was computed every 0.1  au from 0.3 - 1.2  au .",
    "we ran the full simulation for two longitudes in heliocentric observing coordinates , with the center of the cme at l=90 ( i.e. @xmath86 and l=30 ( @xmath87 the locations of the cme are shown in figure  [ fig : small - scale ] ( panels a and e ) .",
    "each colored sector corresponds to a location at which we computed the radiances . in panels",
    "b and f we show the excess radiance ( i.e.  the radiance with the quiet - wind values subtracted ) for both total power and polarized radiance . in panels c and g we show the ratio of the polarized to total radiance excess , and in panels d and h the ratio of polarized to total radiance . in all of the plots ,",
    "the colors of the traces match those in the schematic in panels a and e. at elongations where the line of sight intersects the ts inside the transient , an overbar is placed on the plots .",
    "this small transient can be considered to approximate a blob of plasma , and thus provides us with a clear view of the differences between observing in total power and observing in polarized radiance .",
    "the most obvious characteristic of the excess radiance plots is the fall - off of radiance as the transient moves further from the sun .",
    "although the derivative of signal with respect to elongation @xmath30 is much steeper at @xmath88 ( left column ) than at @xmath89 ( right column ) , that difference is primarily geometrical .",
    "comparing the two sky - angle cases at similar radii rather than similar elongations yields a far smaller differences between the two cases , as might be expected from figure [ fig : thomson - scattering - effects ] .",
    "turning to the polarization fraction of the radiance excesses ( panels c and g of figure  [ fig : small - scale ] ) , the @xmath24 signal falls off rapidly with elongation @xmath30 for the limb transient ( @xmath88 ) at left .",
    "but for the near - observer transient ( @xmath89 ) at right , polarization increases to a maximum near @xmath90 .",
    "both effects may be expected from figure [ fig : thomson - scattering - effects ] . for both transient longitudes considered here ,",
    "the signal from the transient at its closest to the thomson surface has a degree of polarization about 4 times greater than at its furthest .    as might be expected from the differential analysis in section [ sub : polarized - scattering - basics ] , when the transient is far from the ts and its polarization is thus less than that of the quiet solar wind , the polarization of the total received light is reduced . when it is close to the ts the polarization is increased , reaching 80%  for the transient directed 60 from the plane of the sky as that transient crosses the ts .      .",
    "]    we repeated the simulations of figure [ fig : small - scale ] for a simplified conical cme with a longitudinal cone angle of 30 , and otherwise identical parameters .",
    "the results from this cone are shown in figure  [ fig : large - scale ] , in the same format as was used for figure  [ fig : small - scale ] .",
    "as expected the cme appears much broader in elongation .",
    "the degree of polarization shows generally similar trends , reaching a maximum near the thomson surface .",
    "where the cme first intersects the ts , the highest degree of polarization ( approaching 100% ) occurs at the leading edge of the cme , thus producing a kind of intrinsic edge enhancement .",
    "the trailing edge , which is remote from the ts , is de - emphasized , in some cases by well over an order of magnitude .",
    "the cme directed at 30 always extends to the smallest elongations computed ( 12 ) when it lies between the sun and the observer .",
    "this is because this cme has a grazing impact with the observer .",
    "the extension appears as the flat tails in the unpolarized radiance ( solid ) traces in figure  [ fig : large - scale]f . in the polarized ( dashed ) traces , on the other hand",
    ", the radiance falls off rapidly as the scattering approaches pure forward scatter , which is unpolarized .",
    "we conclude that the polarization signal from typical cmes is not completely spoiled by dilution due to the large angular extent of the cmes or the existence of a background solar wind .",
    "further analysis is required ( and is presented in our paper iii of this series ) to determine how to extract cme position in three dimensions from the polarization signal .      , with the coloured spirals representing the locations of the cir at which the simulations were performed . since the cir moves from east ( left ) to west ( right ) and",
    "is not symmetrical , we show both sides of the sun in the plots . also the computations are continued all the way to 180 elongation .",
    "the elongation axis is reversed so that the traces appear in the same orientation as on the sky .",
    "note that computations are not performed at elongations less than 12 . ]",
    "the third disturbance we simulated to generate intuition about the effects of geometry on pb was a spiral structure corresponding to a 400@xmath91 cir in the plane of the ecliptic .",
    "we treated the cir as a dense spiral structure with an extent in longitude of 24 , and increased linearly in density to an enhancement factor of 3 at 1.2  au , beyond which it was of constant density .",
    "the results are summarized in figure  [ fig : time - stat ] in a similar format to figure  [ fig : small - scale ] , however here we show all elongations from -180 to + 180 ( with negative `` elongations '' corresponding to angle west of the sun in the ecliptic , and positive `` elongations '' corresponding to angle east of the sun in the ecliptic ) .",
    "the computations were carried out at longitudes of the leading edge of the base of 303 , 3 , 63 , 123 , 183 and 243 relative to the observer ( the 3 offset is a computational convenience ) .",
    "these correspond to approximately -8.5 , -4 , + 0.5 , + 5 , + 9.5 and + 14 ( -13 ) days from the arrival of the cir at the observer .",
    "again , at elongations where the line of sight intersects the ts inside the cir or close to it , the polarization is high ( approaching 100% ) , while at elongations where the line of sight intersects the ts far from the cir the polarization is far less pronounced even if the unpolarized signal is strong .",
    "a major difference in polarization behavior between the cir and the earlier two cases is that when the cir is growing in the eastern part of the image ( i.e. approaching in the east ) , the polarization at the leading edge is persistently low ( figure  [ fig : time - stat]c and [ fig : time - stat]d ) , while the cme and compact structure display a maximum in polarization if and when they pass through the ts .",
    "this is a direct result of the geometry of a cir : the tangential contact between the line of sight and the cir is dependent on the spiral angle of the cir , and is always far from the ts ; whereas for most cmes , when inside 1  au , the tangent point is generally close to the ts .",
    "see figure  10 of paper i for plots showing the distance of the cir leading edge from the ts .",
    "we conclude that , although cirs should be visible in polarized as well as unpolarized light , they behave differently than other types of feature because of their stationary , spiral shape . in particular , the polarization behavior of the front of a cir",
    "is quite different from that of a localized structure such as a cme .",
    "cirs should thus prove directly recognizable by inspection of polarized imges , even without detailed inversion for three - dimensional structure .",
    "we have developed an appropriately - simplified theory of polarized thomson - scattered imaging in the heliosphere , and shown that sensitivity of @xmath24 measurements to electron density is well localized along the line of sight at the ts , in contrast to the thomson plateau observed via unpolarized light ( @xmath25 ) . for unpolarized detection , the illumination function and scattering efficiency have equal and opposite second derivatives at the ts , leading to the thomson plateau ; in the case of excess polarized radiance detection they have equal second derivatives at the ts , leading to a sharper maximum in intensity than would be observed via an @xmath92scattering process with no angular dependence .",
    "the difference in spatial kernel between @xmath24 and @xmath25 enables location of individual solar wind features in three dimensions , and we have developed a theory of small feature location including the importance of snr and kinematic effects in determining the precision to which location may be measured .",
    "the curvature of the ts breaks the front / back asymmetry that hinders attempts to accomplish the same thing in coronagraph images near the sun .",
    "features far from the ts are more readily located in three dimensions than are features near the ts , because the @xmath57 ratio varies more with the sky angle @xmath48 far from the ts .",
    "an instrument that could measure the two relevant polarizations with comparable snr to that of the _ stereo_/secchi imagers could locate the exit angle of small features within well under 10 , greatly enhancing interpretation of the remote solar wind signal and potentially improving space weather prediction through direct location of earth - directed features that are hard to measure geometrically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath24 signal is a differential signal that , by construction , eliminates unpolarized bright features from the field of view .",
    "this effect has been used historically in coronagraphs to remove stray light and sky light from the thomson scattering signal .",
    "direct application in the heliosphere is more complex because the zodiacal light is polarized far from the sun and hence is not removed by the _",
    "pb _ calculation in the wide - field heliospheric imaging case .",
    "however , the zodiacal light is extremely stable both in degree of polarization and in overall intensity , leading to the possibility of direct absolute measurements of the thomson scattering signal using long baselines and _ in situ _ measurement of the average wind density ; the additional stability of the polarization ratio further reduces the residual background variation below what may be achieved with a single measurement . other diffuse light sources from near earth include orbital ram airglow and high altitude aurora , both of which we anticipate to be unpolarized and hence invisible in _ pb . _    we have performed simple forward modeling of geometric structures similar to known solar wind structures to develop intuition about how a polarized heliospheric imager , if developed , will respond to those features .",
    "we find that one may expect significant , unambiguous @xmath24 signatures of the 3-d location of large features , although analysis of such features is more complex than compact features whose geometry may be neglected .",
    "techniques for , and the limits of , large scale feature location in 3-d from @xmath24 measurements require more detailed treatment and will be covered in the third paper of this series .",
