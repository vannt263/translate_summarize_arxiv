    "@xmath156 decreased with decreasing @xmath31 and disappeared at 10  k.@xcite thus , the energy gap was clearly observed at 10  k. this also supports our conclusion ; that is , both the broad minimum at @xmath8 80  k in the @xmath29 curve and the rapid increase in @xmath27 below 80  k with decreasing @xmath31 are caused by the ic - sdw order between the spins of the conduction electrons and not by a magnetic scattering , such as , the kondo effect .",

    "in addition , the broad maximum between 400 and 600  k looks very ambiguous in the data obtained in vacuum compared with that in an air flow .",
    "recently , it was reported that oxygens are removed from [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath2@xmath3[coo@xmath1 ] above 723  k (= 450  @xmath40c ) even in an oxygen flow.@xcite therefore , both the clear thermal hysteresis and the suppression of the broad maximum in the @xmath105 curve obtained in vacuum are induced by the formation of oxygen deficiency . as well as the oxygen deficiency ,",
    "the substitution of ca by y decreases the average co valence;@xcite as a result , the @xmath105 curve of the y - doped sample looks quite similar to that of [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath2@xmath3[coo@xmath1 ] obtained in vacuum on cooling ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hight](b ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : hight2](a ) ) .",
    "the broad shoulder in the @xmath105 curve at 400 - 600  k is in good agreement with the behavior of the @xmath88 curve , because the @xmath88 curve shows a broad maximum between 400 and 600  k , and above 600  k @xmath27 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath31 up to 1000  k.@xcite on the other hand , the @xmath89 curve exhibits a small change in slope around @xmath157 ; that is , as @xmath31 increases from 0  k , @xmath118 increases monotonically up to @xmath8 100  k and seems to level off a constant value ( @xmath158vk@xmath129 ) up to @xmath8 400  k , then @xmath118 again increases linearly ( d@xmath118/d@xmath159 80  nvk@xmath152 ) up to 1000  k.@xcite therefore , above @xmath134 , the @xmath29 curve exhibits a semiconducting behavior , whereas the @xmath89 curve metallic .    the two co sites in the [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath2@xmath79[coo@xmath1 ] lattice leads to a question which is responsible for the spin state transition , as in the case of ic - sdw order .",
    "both the change in slope of @xmath89 at @xmath8 400  k and the broad maximum of @xmath88 at 400 - 600  k suggest that the co ions in the [ coo@xmath1 ] plane play a significant role on the spin state transition .",
    "indeed , the related cobaltites , na@xmath160[coo@xmath1 ] and na@xmath15ca@xmath18[coo@xmath1 ] , were reported to exhibit a small magnetic anomaly around 300  k , @xcite probably indicating the existence of a spin state transition , although the [ coo@xmath1 ] plane was considered to be rigid due to a network of edge - sharing coo@xmath22 octahedra . hence , the co ions in the [ coo@xmath1 ] planes are most likely to change their spin state at 400 - 600  k.    the existence of the spin state transition suggests that the crystal - field splitting between @xmath161 and @xmath162 levels is comparable to @xmath163  k. thus , above @xmath134 , charge carrier transport in the [ coo@xmath1 ] plane is considered to be dominated by not only the direct hopping of the @xmath161 electrons between the co ions @xcite but also the hybridization between co-@xmath162 levels and o-2@xmath164 levels , as in the case of the perovskite lacoo@xmath5.@xcite indeed , @xmath27 of lacoo@xmath5 decreased with increasing @xmath31 above 500  k,@xcite which is the temperature of the apparent spin state transition from @xmath112 to @xmath114 accompanied with an insulator - to - metal transition .",
    "if we employ the modified heikes formula using the degeneracy of spin and orbital degrees of freedom of co ions,@xcite the value of @xmath165 is calculated as 154  @xmath41vk@xmath129 , when the concentration of co@xmath111 is equivalent to that of co@xmath110 and both co@xmath110 and co@xmath111 are in the @xmath112 state . in order to explain the observed @xmath89 curve above @xmath134 ,",
    "it is necessary to assume that co@xmath110 is in the @xmath112 state and co@xmath111 in the @xmath113 state ; under this assumption , we obtain @xmath165=293  @xmath41vk@xmath129 , although such inequivalent spin state is unlikely to exist at elevated temperatures .    our @xmath24 measurements using single crystal platelets of [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath2@xmath3[coo@xmath1 ] showed a clear thermal hysteresis with a width of @xmath8 25  k for the spin state transition at @xmath134 .",
    "@xcite the thermal hysteresis was also confirmed by a heat capacity measurement.@xcite these indicate that the spin state transition accompanies a structural change , as well as the case of lacoo@xmath5 around 100  k and 500  k detected by neutron diffraction measurements .",
    "@xcite    hence , in order to elucidate the mechanism of the spin state transition , further @xmath0sr experiments on the related cobaltites , such as na@xmath160[coo@xmath1 ] and na@xmath15ca@xmath18[coo@xmath1 ] , are necessary ; in particular , a precise muonic knight shift measurement would provide a significant information on the change in @xmath95 during the spin state transition .",
    "in addition , we need an x - ray and/or neutron diffraction analysis for [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath2@xmath79[coo@xmath1 ] as a function of temperature , to obtain the information on structural change , which would affect the magnitude and distribution of @xmath95 above @xmath134 . furthermore , the photo - emission and x - ray absorption studies on [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath2@xmath3[coo@xmath1 ] at elevated temperatures are needed to determine the spin state for understanding the transport properties above @xmath134 .",

    "the spin states above @xmath166  k are not clear at present . , width=302 ]    we investigated the magnetism of the misfit layered cobaltite , [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath2@xmath3[coo@xmath1 ] , by a positive muon spin rotation and relaxation experiment .",
    "it is found that [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath2@xmath3[coo@xmath1 ] exhibits the successive magnetic transitions , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : magntrans ] .",
    "an incommensurate ( ic ) spin density wave ( sdw ) is observed directly by zf-@xmath0sr below about 30  k , and evidence for the onset of the ic - sdw state is seen below @xmath54  k , while the muon spin relaxation is characteristic of a paramagnet ( pm ) above @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the long - range ic - sdw order completes below @xmath8 30  k , whereas the short - range order appears below 100  k. also the ic - sdw is found to propagate in the [ coo@xmath1 ] plane , with oscillating moments directed along the @xmath11-axis . below @xmath167",
    "k , the ic - sdw apparently coexists with ferrimagnetism ( fr ) .    at 400 - 600",
    "k , the spin state of co ions changes ; that is , the populations of the low- , intermediate- and high - spin states are most likely to vary gradually with increasing temperature above 380  k (= @xmath134 ) .",
    "also , this transition is found to be sensitive to the co valence , which is controlled by doping and/or oxygen deficiency .",
    "these two magnetic transitions detected by @xmath0sr are found to correlate closely with the transport properties of [ ca@xmath1coo@xmath2@xmath3[coo@xmath1 ] ; in particular , both a broad minimum at around 80  k and a broad maximum between 400 and 600  k in the @xmath29 curve .",
