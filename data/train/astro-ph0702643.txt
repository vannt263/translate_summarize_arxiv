    "the tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) between the luminosity of galaxies and their rotation velocity is a fundamental scaling relation that constrains galaxy formation and evolution models ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "recent local studies focus on stellar or baryonic masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are easier to model than luminosity .",
    "distant stellar - mass tfrs ( m@xmath0tfrs ) have also been studied ( conselice et al . 2005 ; flores et al .",
    "neither found evidence for evolution to redshifts @xmath8 or 0.6 , respectively , but each pruned their data to exclude morphologically odd galaxies .",
    "this letter presents a study of the m@xmath0tfr to redshift @xmath9 using a sample of 544 galaxies with strong emission lines .",
    "following @xcite , we exclude few galaxies and adopt a new velocity measure that includes both velocity gradients ( usually rotation ) and velocity spread ( dispersion ) .",
    "we adopt a @xmath10cdm cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "galaxy kinematics and morphologies at @xmath8 are possible with high resolution spectra and images . to track different morphologies and redshifts , samples should be large enough to be subdivided .",
    "the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ) provides such data .",
    "single - orbit images were taken by the hubble space telescope advanced camera for surveys ( hst / acs ) in the f606w ( @xmath14 ) and f814w ( @xmath15 ) band - passes , and spectra were obtained by the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe 2 survey ( deep2 ) ; see details in @xcite .",
    "observations and reduction of kinematics are described in @xcite for data similar to deep2 .",
    "kinematics are measured from the strongest emission line(s ) among h@xmath16 , h@xmath17 , [ oii ] @xmath18 , and [ o iii ] @xmath19 .",
    "the spectral resolution is fwhm=@xmath20  , or 56 km @xmath21 at @xmath22 ( gaussian @xmath23 km s@xmath24 ) .",
    "emission line widths can be measured down to @xmath25 of the @xmath26 or @xmath27 km s@xmath24 , and velocity centroids for rotation curves are good to 0.4 of @xmath26 or @xmath28 km s@xmath24 .",
    "rotation velocities can be detected down to @xmath29 km s@xmath24 , if present .",
    "we chose a sample of galaxies that span a wide range in redshift , stellar mass , and morphology .",
    "the deep2 survey had magnitude limits of @xmath30 , bright enough to yield good hst / acs imaging .",
    "a redshift limit of @xmath31 ensures that galaxies of all colors on the  blue sequence \" @xcite are well - sampled . to yield good quality kinematics ,",
    "emission lines were required to have integrated intensities",
    "@xmath32 e@xmath33  in the summed one - dimensional spectrum , and spectrographic slits had to be aligned to within 40  of the major axes of the galaxies ( see fig .",
    "13 of @xcite ) .",
    "also , to reduce the effects of dust , edge - on systems with @xmath34 were excluded , and to allow a reliable rotation measure , nearly face on galaxies with @xmath35 were removed .",
    "a total of 14 galaxies were excluded because they had emission lines with disturbed morphologies or that had contamination by emission from a nearby galaxy on the sky .",
    "after additional cosmetic cuts were made @xcite , the final sample became 544 galaxies .",
    "our final sample is primarily selected on emission line strength .",
    "in order to interpret dynamical measurements made from the spectra , accurate position angles and ellipticities of galaxies must be obtained from hst imaging . to measure these parameters ,",
    "the sextractor galaxy photometry software @xcite is used , as discussed in @xcite . to obtain quantitative morphologies for galaxies",
    ", we use the gini / m@xmath36 method of @xcite .",
    "this system of objective structural parameters has been shown to reliably divide galaxies into bins analogous to hubble types ; namely , early type spirals , late type spirals and irregulars , and major mergers .",
    "galaxies are classified in the @xmath14 image for @xmath37 and in @xmath15 for @xmath38 .",
    "such quantitative morphologies are obtainable only for galaxies with petrosian radii @xmath39 , images that have a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath40 , and that do not fall near the edge of the hst / acs ccd chip .",
    "galaxies without quantitative morphologies are not removed from the sample for completeness sake , and do not differ statistically from the rest of the sample .",
    "all photometric parameters , including quantitative morphologies , will appear in a forthcoming paper , @xcite . in a separate exercise ,",
    "we visually classified all galaxies and found examples that were fairly normal according to gini / m@xmath36 , but looked to our eye to be more disturbed or compact ; we discuss these galaxies separately .",
    "spatially extended emission lines in the galaxy spectra are used to measure gas rotation and dispersion profiles .",
    "since the spatial extent of the line emission is at most only a few times the seeing ( typically @xmath41 fwhm ) , the effect of seeing must be modeled .",
    "we do this with the rotcurve fitting procedure of @xcite .",
    "the kinematic model we fit has two parameters : the velocity on the flat part of the rotation velocity profile , @xmath2 , and the velocity dispersion from a spatially resolved fit to the two - dimensional spectra , @xmath6 .",
    "the best - fit @xmath2 values are corrected for inclination with the measured galaxy ellipticities . for galaxies without a disk - like geometry ( based on visual inspection of hst / acs images ) , @xmath2 is not inclination - corrected .",
    "these galaxies are flagged in the following analysis , but fits do not change if all galaxies are inclination - corrected .",
    "the @xmath6 we measure does not have to correspond to a literal gas velocity dispersion like that of stars in an elliptical galaxy .",
    "instead , for @xmath42 km s@xmath24 , @xmath6 likely measures the relative motions of individual regions , as in spiral arms or a thick disk ; for @xmath43 km s@xmath24 , @xmath6 likely represents an effective velocity dispersion caused by the blurring of velocity gradients on scales at or below the seeing limit that may not even have a preferred plane .",
    "an uncertainty of 0.1 dex is adopted in both @xmath6 and the inclination - corrected @xmath2 to account for random errors and the dependence of the model parameters on the assumed seeing and scale radius of the rotation curve .",
    "results do not change significantly if uncertainties of 0.2 are chosen , as discussed in  6 .",
    "a few methods of estimating the stellar masses ( @xmath44 ) of galaxies have been investigated in a separate study @xcite .",
    "these methods are : a color-@xmath45 relation from @xcite for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , a color-@xmath45 relation from @xcite for @xmath46 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fits of @xcite which incorporate observed optical and @xmath50-band data , and the method of @xcite .",
    "we choose to adopt the method of @xcite .",
    "these authors calibrated rest - frame @xmath51 photometry and redshifts to the full sed fits of bundy et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to obtain @xmath44 estimates for very blue galaxies that are not detected at @xmath50 , which bundy et al .",
    "( 2005 ) require to derive a @xmath44 .",
    "while the evolution of seds with redshift is included and errors of 0.2 dex are assumed , the results of this paper , as discussed next , change insignificantly if we do not take into account evolution or increase the errors to 0.3 dex @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath52 , where @xmath50 is a constant , combines dynamical support from ordered motion with that from disordered motions @xcite . for a spherically symmetric tracer population with isotropic velocity dispersion and density @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath55 ) , where @xmath56 . therefore ,",
    "if galaxies are virialized systems , and these assumptions about the tracer population are at least approximately correct , then @xmath57 should at least approximately trace the global @xmath26 of galaxy - halo systems . in this case",
    ", the tracer population is the gas producing the emission lines , which we assume follows the @xmath44 . for disk galaxies with exponential @xmath44 profiles",
    ", @xmath58 brackets a range of reasonable values (  5.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "a satisfactory approximation is adopted for all morphologies , @xmath59 ; if @xmath60 is adopted , the overall results do not change .",
    "we henceforth use @xmath4 for our analysis .",
    "the top panel of figure 1 shows @xmath2 versus @xmath44 ( the @xmath61tfr ) for a range of redshifts . the majority of spirals ( green triangles and blue squares not outlined in black ) form a clear ridge - line that compares well to a local relation from @xcite , consisting of well - ordered spirals , and to a @xmath62 relation from @xcite , who included only  elongated disks . \"",
    "in contrast , almost all of the other classes ( red circles and symbols outlined in black ) lie to lower @xmath2 , causing a large scatter ( @xmath3 dex in velocity ) .        this morphological dependence of tully - fisher scatter is well known . among local studies , e.g. ,",
    "larger scatter is found for close pairs with kinematic disorders @xcite and when peculiar galaxies are included @xcite . at higher redshifts ,",
    "larger scatter is found for @xmath63 galaxies with  complex kinematics \" @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath64% of galaxies found with kinematics unrelated to rotation are excluded from tully - fisher studies at @xmath65 @xcite and at @xmath66 @xcite . in summary , because of morphological pruning , no study except that of @xcite incorporates the population of tully - fisher outliers that we detect in a measurement of tully - fisher evolution , and the conclusions of such studies will only apply for the subsample of galaxies that are morphologically well - ordered .    for @xmath67 , the percentage of galaxies that scatter to low @xmath2 from the tully - fisher ridge - line ( defined as the left - most dotted line in figure 1 ) increases with redshift ( 18% , 35% , 42% , and 62% for the four redshift bins plotted ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite find bright galaxies with @xmath68 at @xmath69 that are rare at low redshift .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.1 uses @xmath4 instead of @xmath2 in the m@xmath0tfr .",
    "the resulting relation has scatter that is not much greater than our measurement uncertainties and does not evolve significantly with @xmath70 .",
    "dex ) decrease in intercept from @xmath22 to @xmath71 due simply to the predicted increase in @xmath44 of @xmath72 for a typical spiral galaxy ( @xmath73 and an exponentially decreasing star formation rate with @xmath74 gyr ) , but it would not be detectable given our errors .",
    "we do not attempt to determine @xmath50 by minimizing the scatter in the @xmath75tfr because @xmath50 is sensitive to the morphological mix of the sample and the distribution of measurement errors .",
    "] evidently , galaxies with low @xmath2 compared to the @xmath2/m@xmath0tfr ridge - line have a significant @xmath6 component which causes them to lie on the @xmath4/m@xmath0tfr .",
    "lines are fit to the @xmath4/m@xmath0tfr in the four redshift bins in fig.1 with a maximum likelihood method detailed in @xcite .",
    "we fit log@xmath76 and all excess scatter is allocated to the @xmath4-coordinate .",
    "the fits do not vary significantly for the different redshift bins .",
    "average values for the slope , intercept at @xmath77 , and intrinsic scatter over all redshifts are @xmath78 , and 0.10 dex in @xmath4 . the average rms scatter is 0.16 dex in @xmath4 , which corresponds to 0.47 dex in @xmath44 ( @xmath79 magnitudes ) .",
    "the fitted relations are not very sensitive to the error estimates for @xmath4 and @xmath44 ; changing either error estimate by @xmath80 dex changes fit intercepts within the 1-@xmath26 error , and slopes by not more than @xmath81 dex .",
    "however , our limited @xmath44 range at higher redshift makes slope measurements more uncertain than the formal fit errors .",
    "furthermore , different estimates of @xmath44 can yield a range of @xmath82 dex in intercept , and @xmath44 estimators with non - evolving seds can cause the @xmath83tfr to show @xmath84 dex evolution in intercept with redshift , but this reflects problems of these estimators rather than actual evolution in the @xmath83tfr .",
    "since no tully - fisher sample at low or high redshift has as much scatter as our @xmath2/m@xmath0tfr due to morphological pruning , it is rather remarkable that the @xmath4/m@xmath0tfr scatter for the same sample of galaxies manages to approach as close as it does to the scatters found for the @xmath2/m@xmath0tfrs for galaxies with relatively undisturbed morphologies ( @xmath25 dex in @xmath44 for @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , fig.1 shows that the @xmath44 faber - jackson relation for low redshift ( @xmath85 ) early type galaxies from @xcite is consistent with the @xmath4/m@xmath0tfr in terms of slope and intercept .",
    "if those galaxies with @xmath86 m@xmath87 that are off the @xmath61tfr ridge - line with low @xmath2 at higher redshift eventually form into well - ordered disk galaxies on the ridge - line , this trend implies that more massive disk galaxies may be moving onto the @xmath2/m@xmath0tfr with time as their stars and gas  settle \" into more circular / planar - dominated orbits .",
    "the possible mechanisms behind this settling can be circularization of gas orbits , gaseous dissipation to the disk plane , and/or mergers ending with the growth of a gaseous disk .",
    "the scatter for @xmath88 , which we can observe at lower redshift , is also large , suggesting that lower @xmath44 galaxies may currently be settling .",
    "a scenario of galaxy formation that is consistent with our results is one that begins with matter assembling in dark halo potential wells with random orbital kinematics .",
    "the baryonic components form proto - disks that are initially supported by a combination of ordered and random motions .",
    "the material in these proto - disks has been settling since then , unless they undergo major mergers . over the last half or so of their lives , proto - disks and their descendants lie on nearly the same @xmath4/m@xmath0tfr . at first glance ,",
    "the similarity between the faber - jackson relation and the @xmath4/m@xmath0tfr in slope and intercept is reassuring , given that merging proto - disks on parabolic binary orbits should put the merger products close to the faber - jackson relation in fig.1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the origin of the faber - jackson relation could in fact be the pre - existing @xmath4/m@xmath0tfr for disk - like galaxies , if merging is the process that creates ellipticals .",
    "however , additional studies are needed to confirm this speculative scenario .",
    "if the framework we adopt is correct , halo kinematic properties should be related to measurable galaxy kinematics . in particular ,",
    "n - body models show that the slope of the relation between halo mass ( @xmath89 ) and halo @xmath26 ( @xmath90 ) , both measured within the scale radius @xcite , is 0.33 : log@xmath91 = 0.33 log@xmath92 + constant .",
    "remarkably , this slope is nearly consistent with _ both _ galaxy relations .",
    "in addition , neither the halo @xmath93 relation , nor @xmath89 or @xmath90 individually , is predicted to evolve to within @xmath94 from @xmath31 to now ( @xcite ; see @xcite for evolution in terms of virial quantities ) .",
    "so , if @xmath4 is linearly related to halo @xmath90 and @xmath95constant , then the @xmath4/m@xmath0tfr should also evolve little from @xmath31 , in agreement with observations .",
    "furthermore , that neither @xmath89 nor @xmath90 individually evolves might imply that absolute changes in inner baryon structures are also small .",
    "however , when comparing galaxies to halos , there are at least three major complications .",
    "first , since @xmath44 is subject to the star - formation history of a galaxy , it is not as fundamental a quantity as baryonic mass ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "locally , low-@xmath44 galaxies have a greater gas - to - star fraction than more massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so the low - redshift @xmath4/m@xmath97tfr ought to have a steeper slope than the @xmath4/m@xmath0tfr . indeed ,",
    "if we assume that @xmath98 ( roughly consistent with data from @xcite using relations from @xcite to obtain @xmath44 , which we later convert to a @xcite initial mass function ) , then the @xmath4/m@xmath0tfr slope in the lowest redshift bin steepens to @xmath99 .",
    "secondly , galaxies should convert gas into stars over time , causing evolution in @xmath100 .",
    "the third issue is the complicated relation between @xmath4 and @xmath90 , which is expected to be affected by baryon dissipation and the response of the dark halo to it ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , neither of which are completely understood . with a better understanding or measurement of these factors and their time evolution , the relationship between galaxy and halo scaling laws will ultimately become clearer and the effects of baryonic processes during galaxy formation may even be elucidated .",
    "we acknowledge the following grants : nsf ast-0507483 , hst go-10134 , and hst ar-09936 and the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community and appreciate the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain .",
