    "in addition , nonlinear dielectric media can support nonlinear guided waves localized at or near the surfaces , and different types of nonlinear guided waves in planar waveguides have been studied extensively about 20 years ago  @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in the study of electromagnetic surface waves has been renewed after the theoretical prediction  @xcite and subsequent experimental demonstration  @xcite of nonlinearity - induced self - trapping of light near the edge of a one - dimensional waveguide array with self - focusing nonlinearity , that can lead to the formation of a _ discrete surface soliton_. a related effect of light localization and the formation of surface gap solitons have been predicted theoretically and observed experimentally for defocusing periodic nonlinear media  @xcite . in addition , the concept of nonlinear surface and gap solitons has been extended to the case of an interface separating two different nonlinear periodic media  @xcite .",
    "surface solitons are usually considered for one - frequency modes propagating in cubic or saturable nonlinear media . however , multicolor discrete solitons in quadratically nonlinear lattices have been studied theoretically in both one- and two - dimensional lattices  @xcite irrespective to the surface localization effects .",

    "the purpose of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we extend the analysis of two - color surface solitons to the case of two semi - infinite photonic lattices with quadratic nonlinearities .",
    "we study , for the first time to our knowledge , two - color interface solitons in photonic lattices with quadratic nonlinear response .",
    "we analyze the effect of mismatch on the existence , stability , and generation of such novel surface states .",
    "second , for the analysis outlined above we employ two different approaches widely used in the literature : the coupled - mode theory described by the discrete parametrically coupled equations for the fundamental and second - harmonic fields , and also the continuous model with a periodic potential , and demonstrate that both models give the same qualitative results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the two - color interface localized modes in the framework of a discrete model where the interface is modeled by a jump of the propagation constant , assuming that the matching conditions are nearly satisfied for both semi - infinite lattices .",
    "section  iii is devoted to the analysis of a more general case described by a continuous model with a periodically varying potential .",
    "thus we consider the light beam propagating along the interface between two dissimilar optical lattices imprinted in quadratic nonlinear media .",
