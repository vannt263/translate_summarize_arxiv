    "in astrophysics there are numerous scenarios ( cf .",
    "@xcite , henceforth z88 ) in which relativistic electrons and/or high - energetic photons ( heps ) interact on soft background - photons ( sbps ) .",
    "electrons inverse - compton- ( ic- ) up - scatter the sbps , thus producing heps .",
    "simultaneously , the heps react with the sbps and pair - produce new electron - positron - pairs .",
    "obviously , both processes sustain each other , thus giving rise to the development of an electromagnetic cascade .",
    "+ especially , electrons that cause an electromagnetic cascade , can be abundant at the base of a jet of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) . in the magnetosphere",
    "s poles , charge - depleted regions ( called vacuum gaps or electrostatic gaps or just gaps ) are thought to exist @xcite .",
    "these compact regions exhibit a large voltage - drop @xcite and can thus accelerate charged particles to ultra - relativistic energies accompanied by hep - emission @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown for the case of the peculiar radio - galaxy ic 310 , that such gaps are likely to exist in agn - magnetospheres @xcite .",
    "ic 310 showed extreme flux variations ( fig . 4 in @xcite ) with time - scales of about 5 min at tev - energies .",
    "this is evidence of emission - regions of length - scales below the schwarzschild - radius @xmath0 and thus can neither be explained by mini - jet models nor by models with jet - cloud - interaction @xcite .",
    "+ in this proceeding , the physical setting of the considered cascade will be stated in all generality in sec . [ general setting ] .",
    "the kinetic equation of the cascade and its numerical solution via a python3-code will be elucidated in sec .",
    "[ the kinetic equation ] and [ numerical solution ] , respectively . in sec .",
    "[ application to mrk 501 ] the code will be applied for the case of an electromagnetic cascade initiated by electrons , that have been accelerated in a magnetospheric vacuum gap in mrk 501 and interact with lyman-@xmath1-photons .",
    "the electromagnetic cascade considered here have been formulated by z88 .",
    "more specific , linear ic - klein - nishina - pair - cascades are considered .",
    "this means the repeated interaction of relativistic electrons and positrons ( henceforth just called electrons ) as well as heps with an sbp - field via ic - scattering and pair - production ( pp ) .",
    "the energy divided by the electron s rest - frame - energy @xmath2 for the electrons , the heps and the sbps is denoted by @xmath3 ( lorentz - factor ) , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "hence , there are three pools of species :    * the pool of electrons with spectral number - density @xmath6 . * the pool of heps with spectral number - density @xmath7 . * the pool of sbps with spectral number - density @xmath8 . these sbps act as target - photons in what follows .",
    "these distributions are assumed to be isotropic , homogeneous and time - independent . as interaction - processes , there is solely pp and ic - scattering assumed .",
    "( curvature - radiation , elastic photon - photon - scattering etc . is not included . )",
    "+ pp is assumed to happen solely via collisions of the heps with the sbps ( hep - hep - interaction , triplet - pp or higher - order pp - processes are neglected . ) . by this ,",
    "new electrons are created and supplied to the electron - pool .",
    "the electrons , that have been created , are then again available for ic - scattering .",
    "+ ic - scattering happens via collisions of electrons with the sbps . by this ,    * heps are produced and delivered to the pool of heps .",
    "so , these heps are again available for pp . *",
    "the electrons are down - scattered , i.e. they lose energy , although they remain in the electron - pool and can again ic - scatter .",
    "electron - electron - interactions as well as electron - escape and photon - escape from the reaction - volume is neglected .",
    "+ via the interplay of pp and ic - scattering a linear cascade develops @xcite .",
    "+ the cascade affects / replenishes the electron - pool and the pool of heps .",
    "the pool of sbps is not affected by the cascade , hence @xmath8 is assumed to be untouched by ic - scattering ( @xmath9 linearity of the cascade ) .",
    "+ additionally , it is assumed that    a.   electrons with energy @xmath10 are steadily injected with spectral injection - rate @xmath11 ( spectral injection - rate means number - density of injected electrons with energy @xmath3 per time - interval and per @xmath3-interval . ) and/or that b.   heps with energy @xmath12 are steadily injected with spectral injection - rate @xmath13 ( spectral injection - rate means number - density of injected heps with energy @xmath4 per time - interval and per @xmath4-interval . ) .    into the respective pools .",
    "for the injected electrons @xmath14 is assumed to hold , which means that ic - scattering takes place in the klein - nishina - regime .",
    "this is the reason why the considered type of cascade is called ic-_klein - nishina_-pair - cascade by z88 .",
    "notice however , that repeated ic - scattering lowers the energy of an electron and if the electron s energy has shrunk below the klein - nishina - regime , ic - scattering still goes on and on .",
    "therefore , the klein - nishina - criterion is not fulfilled for all ic - scattering - events , only for those involving the injected electrons .",
    "furthermore , @xmath15 is assumed to be satisfied for the injected heps , meaning that the injected photons energy is above the pp - threshold .",
    "the process of such a cascade is sketched in fig . 1 .",
    "the electrons kinetic equation of the cascade described in sec . [ general setting ] was given by z88 and can be derived as follows : + first , to be able to handle ic - scattering and pp one has to yield spectral interaction - rates , @xmath16 for ic - scattering and @xmath17 for pp , respectively .",
    "this has been done by z88 based on findings of @xcite as well as of @xcite . in those derivations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 isotropy ,",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath12 and @xmath18 has been assumed .",
    "+ the spectral ic - interaction - rate @xmath19 , i.e. the probability per time - interval and per @xmath20-interval , for ic - scattering of an electron with original energy @xmath3 to final energy @xmath20 on the sbp - field @xmath21 , is given by eq .",

    "( in this equation @xmath22 is not a quantity on its own but a typing error .",

    "hence , as soon as @xmath21 is given , @xmath16 is given , too .",
    "( however , @xmath21 has to be integrable . ) now , as conservation of energy approximately gives @xmath24 it is obvious that @xmath25 is the probability per time - interval and per @xmath4-interval , for ic - scattering of an electron with original energy @xmath3 on the sbp - field with the production of an hep of energy @xmath4 .",
    "notice that @xmath25 is a function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , while @xmath19 is dependent on @xmath3 and @xmath20 .",
    "+ similarly , @xmath26 is the spectral pp - interaction - rate , i.e. the probability per time - interval and per @xmath3-interval for production of an electron with energy @xmath3 due to interaction of an hep with energy @xmath4 with the sbp - field . of course , at the same time an electron with energy @xmath27",

    "+ second , with aid of the spectral interaction - rates one can now determine the sources and sinks of the electron - distribution . to be more precise",
    ", one can determine the summands of the rate - of - change @xmath28 of the spectral number - density @xmath29 of the electrons :    * consider electrons with energy @xmath3 .",
    "they lose energy via ic - scattering , which leads to a sink of @xmath30 at energy @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , @xmath31 gives the number - density of electrons with any energy below @xmath3 , that are produced via ic - down - scattering of electrons with energy @xmath3 and with spectral number - density @xmath29 on the sbp - field , per time - interval and per @xmath3-interval .",

    "* now , consider electrons with any energy @xmath20 above @xmath3 .",
    "they can be ic - down - scattered to the energy @xmath3 , which leads to a source of @xmath30 at energy @xmath3 .",

    "thus , it is the spectral increase - rate of the number - density of electrons at energy @xmath3 via ic - down - scattering from higher energies .",
    "* now , consider heps with any energy @xmath4 above the pp - threshold @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "such heps can interact with the sbps and pair - produce an electron with energy @xmath3 , which causes a source of @xmath30 at energy @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , @xmath34 gives the number - density of electrons with energy @xmath3 , that are pair - produced via interaction of all available heps above the pp - threshold with the sbp - field , per time - interval and per @xmath3-interval .",
    "so , it is the spectral increase - rate of the number - density of electrons at energy @xmath3 via pp .",
    "* of course , the injection @xmath11 is a source - term , too .",
    "adding up the terms with taking account for the signs yields the spectral rate - of - change of the number - density of the electrons : @xmath35 third , one can determine the sources and sinks of the hep - distribution .",
    "to be more precise , one can determine the summands of the rate - of - change @xmath36 of the spectral number - density @xmath37 of the heps :    * consider heps with energy @xmath4 .",
    "they can pair - produce , which destroys them and thus results in a sink of @xmath38 at energy @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 @xcite gives the number - density of heps with energy @xmath4 , that pair - produce electrons on the sbp - field , per time - interval and per @xmath4-interval .",
    "hence , it is the spectral decrease - rate of the number - density of heps at energy @xmath4 via pp . * next , consider electrons with any energy @xmath3 above the threshold @xmath40 for ic - scattering @xcite .",
    "they can be ic - down - scattered to the energy @xmath41 , while ic - up - scattering an sbp to the energy @xmath4 .",
    "hence , this is a source of @xmath38 at energy @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , @xmath42 yields the number - density of heps with energy @xmath4 , that are produced via ic - down - scattering of electrons with any energy above @xmath40 and with spectral number - density @xmath29 on the sbp - field , per time - interval and per @xmath4-interval .",
    "therefore , it is the spectral increase - rate of the number - density of heps at energy @xmath4 via ic - up - scattering of sbps .",
    "* of course , the injection @xmath13 is a source - term , too .",
    "adding up the terms with taking account for the signs yields the spectral rate - of - change of the number - density of the heps : @xmath43 in the steady - state , the electron- and the hep - distribution does not change .",
    "hence , the total rates - of - change of eq . [ rateofchangeelectrons ] and [ rateofchangephotons ] can be set equal to zero . doing so , solving eq .",
    "[ rateofchangeelectrons ] for @xmath6 , solving eq . [ rateofchangephotons ] for @xmath7 and substituting into eq .",
    "[ rateofchangeelectrons ] yields the final kinetic equation for the electron - distribution : @xmath44 this equation is eq . 1 of z88 .",
    "the fraction in the numerator is equivalent to the quantity @xmath45 of z88 .",
    "the goal is now to find solutions @xmath6 to eq .",
    "[ kineticequation ] . as noted above , @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    "are completely specified as soon as @xmath21 is given .",
    "then , if @xmath21 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are prescribed , the right - hand side is a functional of solely @xmath29 , or briefly written @xmath48 . + the problem can be solved iteratively .",
    "prescribing @xmath21 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 based on the physical setting and guessing an initial function @xmath49 one can determine the right - hand side @xmath50 , which is equal to the new @xmath6 , called @xmath51 .",
    "this can again be plugged into @xmath50 , etc .",
    "hence , @xmath52 is the initialisation and @xmath53 for @xmath54 is the @xmath55 iteration step . employing the banach fixed - point theorem ,",
    "it can be shown that convergence is achieved . + next , to yield @xmath6 in the thomson - regime ( i.e. for @xmath56 ) , where no electrons are pair - produced ( z88 ) and where energy - changes due to ic - scatterings are tiny , eq . 8 by z88",
    "is used , which essentially is a separated and integrated continuity - equation .",
    "the solution of @xmath29 around @xmath57 , where neither the pure thomson - limit nor the klein - nishina - limit is valid , is then determined via interpolating between the @xmath29 from the continuity - equation with the iterated @xmath29 .",
    "+ we have developed an algorithm using the python3-language that executes the described procedure . as no general analytical expressions for the integrals are known , they have to be computed numerically . to be able to determine the integrals with infinite integration - range in a finite timespan",
    ", one has to restrict the infinite integration - ranges to finite ranges .",
    "this is possible without doing errors , if the functions @xmath21 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are not infinitely extended but have an upper cut - off beyond which the distributions are vanishing .",
    "hence , as input to the code one has to prescribe three distributions in energy - space :    * that one @xmath11 of the injected electrons .",
    "* that one @xmath13 of the injected heps . *",
    "that one @xmath8 of the sbps .",
    "every kind of integrable function can be processed by the code .",
    "+ then , the code determines the steady - state electron - distribution @xmath6 that evolves .",
    "additionally , the distribution of produced heps ( second summand in the parentheses of eq . [ kineticequation ] ) is computed . certainly , despite of the assumption of no hep - escape ( cf .",
    "[ general setting ] ) , heps can escape from the boundary - shells of the interaction - volume .",
    "these photons can then be observable .",
    "the general scenario sketched in sec . [ general setting ] will now be specified for the following setting . a presumed gap in the magnetosphere of mrk 501 accelerates electrons ( gaussianly distributed in the energy - space ) , that leak into it from the accretion disk , to energies of about @xmath58 .",
    "hence , they have a distribution @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the lower and upper cut - off , respectively , satisfying @xmath62 in accordance with the condition of bullet point `` a '' in sec . [ general setting ] .",
    "@xmath63 is the width of the distribution and @xmath64 is its norm and specifies the total number - density of electrons that are injected per time - interval .",
    "these electrons travel away from the agn - centre along the jet .",
    "furthermore it is assumed that these electrons penetrate into a region , which is pervaded by lyman-@xmath1-photons , i.e. by photons of wavelength @xmath65 .",
    "lyman-@xmath1-photons are abundant in galaxy - cores .",
    "certainly , ionising radiation from the accretion disk or from hot stars affects infalling hydrogen causing recombination lines .",
    "the kink in the radio jet of mrk 501 and its fanning - out @xcite might be evidence for a violent event ( galaxy - merger in the past , binary black hole or jet - star - interaction ) , so young stars and/or emission nebulae should be present , which justifies the assumption of lyman-@xmath1-photons .",
    "thus , the sbps are distributed according to @xmath66 with @xmath67 . here",
    ", @xmath68 describes the total number - density of sbps and is treated as a free parameter , in contrast to z88 , who uses @xmath69 . in this scenario ,",
    "no heps are assumed to be injected , so @xmath70 . in the interaction - region",
    ", the described cascade takes place and heps escape from its border - region .",
    "we have simulated this cascade with our code .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cascadeiterationplusspectrum].a the electron - distribution converges after approximately 20 iteration steps and steady - state spectra evolve .",
    "the escaping cascaded heps as well as photons produced in a traditional synchrotron - self - compton- ( ssc- ) scenario taking place farther outwards in the jet form an observable spectrum .",
    "the superposition of the cascaded spectrum @xcite with the ssc - spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ cascadeiterationplusspectrum].b .",
    "the ssc - spectrum constitutes the background from x - rays over @xmath3-rays up to the tev - regime , while the cascaded spectrum causes a peculiar bump between 800 gev and 4 tev .",

    "1 the parameters used for the modelling are given .",

    "the authors acknowledge all contributions to the matplotlib - project .                    a cascade is called linear , if self - interaction of cascade - species is negligible , i.e. if solely interactions of electrons or heps with the sbps take place ( but not interactions of electrons or heps with heps ) .",
    "in other words , a cascade is linear if only the sbps act as target - photons . in this case",
    "the production - rate of heps , of electrons is direct proportional to the injection - rate of electrons , of heps , respectively , which clarifies the denotation `` linear '' .",
    "one can show by comparison of cross - sections , that a cascade in the klein - nishina - regime , thomson - regime is usually linear , always non - linear , respectively ( z88 ) .",
    "a linear cascade is present , if the produced heps density is similar or smaller in comparison to the sbps one .",

    "this is possible only if @xmath71 due to kinematics of the pp - event ( z88 ) .",
    "hence , if an extended distribution of sbps is considered , with @xmath72 being the upper cut - off of this distribution , then pp sets in if @xmath73 .    consider pp by collision of an hep with energy @xmath4 with an sbp of energy @xmath5 .",
    "such events can produce only such electrons whose energy @xmath3 satisfies @xmath74 , due to kinematic constraints ( z88 ) .",
