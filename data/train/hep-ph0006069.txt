    "the goal of this paper is to derive an effective string theory of vortices beginning with a field theory containing classical vortex solutions .",
    "the abelian higgs model is an example of such a theory .",
    "nielsen and olesen  @xcite showed that this model has classical magnetic vortex solutions .",
    "these vortices are tubes of magnetic flux with constant energy per unit length .",
    "the motivation for this work came from the dual superconductor picture of confinement  @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "a dual meissner effect confines electric color flux ( @xmath0 flux ) to narrow tubes connecting quark  antiquark pairs .",
    "calculations with explicit models of this type  @xcite have been compared both with experimental data and with monte carlo simulations of qcd  @xcite . to a good approximation , aside from a color factor , the dual abelian higgs model , coupling dual potentials to a scalar higgs field carrying magnetic charge , can be used to describe the results of these calculations . however , these calculations neglect the effect of fluctuations in the shape of the flux tube on the @xmath1 interactions . we show in this paper that taking account of those fluctuations leads to an effective string theory of long distance qcd .",
    "well before the introduction of the idea of dual superconductivity , string models  @xcite had been used to understand the origin of regge trajectories , and they have continued to be used to describe other features of hadron physics , such as the spectrum of hybrid mesons . in the dual superconductor picture , a string arises because the dual potentials couple to a quark ",
    "antiquark pair via a dirac string whose ends are a source and sink of electric color flux . the effect of the string is to create a flux tube ( or abrikosov  nielsen  olesen vortex  @xcite ) connecting the quark ",
    "antiquark pair . as the pair moves",
    ", this flux tube sweeps out a space time surface on which the dual higgs field must vanish .",
    "this condition determines the location of the qcd string in the dual superconductor picture .",
    "the effort to obtain an effective string theory for abrikosov  nielsen  olesen vortices has a long history , independent of any connection to qcd .",
    "nambu  @xcite attached quarks to the ends of superconducting vortices , and found an expression for the classical action of the resulting ano vortex in the singular london limit of infinite higgs mass .",
    "he introduced a cutoff to render this action finite , and showed that it was proportional to the area of the worldsheet ( the nambu ",
    "goto action ) .",
    "frster  @xcite took into consideration the curvature of the worldsheet .",
    "he showed that in the strong coupling limit , with the ratio of vector and scalar masses held fixed , the effects of curvature were unimportant , and the classical action for the vortex reduced to the nambu ",
    "goto action .",
    "this limit can be regarded as the long distance limit , since only zero mass excitations are left in the theory .",
    "equivalently , since the flux tube radius vanishes in this limit , all physical distances , measured in units of the flux tube radius , are becoming large .",
    "all degrees of freedom except the transverse oscillations of the vortex are frozen out .",
    "gervais and sakita  @xcite first considered the quantum theory of the vortices of the abelian higgs model in the same long distance limit .",
    "they used the results of frster to define collective coordinates for the vortices , by means of which they constructed an effective vortex action .",
    "they also obtained a formal expression for the feynman path integral of the abelian higgs model as an integration over vortex sheets .",
    "however , they were not able to write this expression as an integral over the physical degrees of freedom of the vortices .",
    "lscher , symanzik , and weisz  @xcite considered the leading semiclassical corrections to the classical nambu ",
    "goto action due to transverse string fluctuations , and showed how to regulate the resulting divergences .",
    "they showed that for a string of length @xmath2 with fixed ends , the leading semiclassical contribution to the heavy quark potential is @xmath3 . in a second paper , lscher  @xcite showed that this result was unaffected by the addition of other terms to the effective string action .",
    "polchinski and strominger  @xcite discussed the relation of the abelian higgs model to fundamental string theory , regarding the theory of ano vortices as an effective string theory .",
    "they explained how existing string quantization methods were inappropriate for quantizing the vortices . to compensate for the anomalies  @xcite in these quantization methods",
    ", they introduced an additional term , the `` polchinski strominger term , '' into the effective vortex action .",
    "akhmedov , chernodub , polikarpov , and zubkov  @xcite studied the quantum theory of ano vortices in the london limit , in particular , they studied the transformation from field degrees of freedom to vortex degrees of freedom .",
    "they showed that the jacobian of this transformation contained the `` polchinski strominger term '' as a factor .",
    "although they , like gervais and sakita , did not obtain a complete expression for the path integral , this paper provided an important stimulus to our own work .",
    "in the current paper , we simplify and extend work done in an earlier paper  @xcite .",
    "we begin with the path integral representation of a field theory having vortex solutions .",
    "it is an effective field theory describing phenomena at distances greater than the flux tube radius .",
    "we end up with an effective string theory of vortices in a form suitable for explicit calculations .",
    "we apply this theory to calculate the energy @xmath4 and angular momentum @xmath5 of the fluctuations of a string bounded by the curve generated by the worldlines of a quark ",
    "antiquark pair separated by a fixed distance and rotating with fixed angular velocity .",
    "this gives the contribution of string fluctuations to the regge trajectory @xmath6 , which we compare with the experimental @xmath7 and @xmath8 trajectories .",
    "in section [ partition section ] , we rewrite the path integral over field configurations of the abelian higgs model containing vortices as an integral over surfaces on which the higgs field vanishes .",
    "this introduces a jacobian due to the change from field variables to string variables ( surfaces ) .",
    "this jacobian is the key to determining the action of the effective string theory , and to defining the integral over all surfaces .",
    "we next use the formalism described in section  [ partition section ] to obtain an effective theory of ano vortices . in section [ jacobian factor ] , we show how the jacobian divides into a field part and a string part . the two parts of the jacobian play different roles in the effective theory . in section",

    "we obtain an expression for the contribution of string fluctuations to the effective action in section [ small f section ] , and in sections [ regularization section ] and [ w_2 section ] describe how to regularize this expression , making use of the results of lscher , symanzik , and weisz  @xcite . in section [ regge effective potential section ]",
