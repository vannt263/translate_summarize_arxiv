    "a current topic of interest is to include pairing correlations in nuclear dynamics @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we systematically investigated the possibility to describe the isoscalar ( is ) and isovector ( iv)-gqr including pairing using the time dependent hartree - fock + bcs ( tdhf+bcs ) approach .",
    "there are several reasons to have chosen the gqr has a test ground ( i ) as far as we know , the isoscalar and isovector gqr have never been systematically investigated using a time - dependent edf framework and therefore our study should make possible to identify weakness and strength of this approach in this context ; ( ii ) a systematic analysis exists using the qrpa approach allowing for comparisons @xcite ; ( iii ) a large number of experimental data exists especially for the is @xcite and therefore not only qualitative but also quantitative studies can be made ( iv ) the experimental observation of the iv - gqr has recently made some progress @xcite ; ( v ) thanks to these progress , the gqr has been recently proposed as a possible alternative tool to get informations on the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xcite    in the present work , we have systematically investigated the evolution of nuclei that are found spherical in their ground states using two different skyrme functionals .",
    "the static properties and the dynamical evolution have been obtained consistently using the hf+bcs and tdhf+bcs approach . the tdhf+bcs method , while less general than the tdhfb framework and leading to specific difficulties @xcite , has the advantage that each evolution can be made in a reasonable time allowing to perform the calculation over a wide range of nuclei .    in the following , the microscopic approach is briefly described .",
    "then , the protocol for selecting nuclei is discussed as well as some average properties related to the pairing correlations , the root mean - square radius ... properties of the response in the low - lying and high - lying sector are investigated .",
    "we finally illustrate the usefulness of large scale gqr study with the possibility to infer from it information on the symmetry energy .",
    "the tdhf+bcs theory is a simplified version of the tdhfb approach where the off - diagonal part of the pairing field is neglected .",
    "properties , advantages and drawback of this theory have been discussed extensively in refs .",

    "the single - particle states of the nilsson hamiltonian are first obtained to initiate the imaginary time convergence . for each nuclei , to avoid the convergence towards local minima that sometimes might happen with ev8 , we performed 4 types of nilsson calculations to initiate the self - consistent convergence : one assuming spherical shape , one oblate , one prolate and one triaxial deformation .",
    "nuclei are assumed to be spherical if the deformation parameter after the imaginary time verifies @xmath39 where the deformation parameter is defined through @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",

    "several comments can be made .",
    "first , these gaps are slightly higher than those reported in ref .",

    "@xcite .",
    "we also see in this figure that the present surface pairing interaction leads to non - zero pairing for @xmath53ca .",
    "[ fig : qt ]    finally , we would like to mention that only nuclei that are not too exotic can be studied in the present work due to the well - known gaz problem appearing in the bcs framework @xcite .",
    "this is clearly seen in the x - axis of fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] that is much less extended than in ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , the area of the nuclear chart explored in the present work corresponds to nuclei that can be realistically accessed in current and future nuclear reaction experiments .",
    "the time evolution of each nucleus reported in figure [ fig : map_spher ] has been systematically performed using the 3d - tdhf code @xcite with its bcs extension as discussed in ref .",
    "the initial condition is the spherical ground state obtained with ev8 followed either by a quadrupole isoscalar or isovector boost .",
    "the time - dependent evolution is performed in r - space using the mesh - step parameter as in the static case and with a mesh size @xmath54 fm .",

    "the corresponding is and iv response function are shown in right side of this figure .",
    "these evolutions illustrate the type of behavior typically observed in medium and heavy nuclei . from this figures",
    ", one could make the following statements :    * _ collective energy : _ both the is and iv response present a highly collective state at the expected energy @xmath59 mev and @xmath60 mev respectively . * _ fragmentation and damping : _ the is - gqr displays beating between the high energy collective modes and the ones at lower energy ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "however the is motion is not damped for long time .",
    "this stems from the fact that the high energy peak corresponds to a single highly collective frequency .",
    "on opposite , in the iv - gqr , an effective damping is observed at short time stemming from the fragmentation of the strength around the collective energy ( @xmath62 mev ) , that is similar to the landau fragmentation generally observed in the monopole response of light nuclei . * _ low lying state : _ finally , by comparing the two curves in panel ( b ) , we see that the open shell nuclei has an extra low lying @xmath63 state that is expected for superfluid systems ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in fig .",

    "the skm * is systematically closer to experimental observation .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that such a direct comparison should be taken with care due to the fact that the technique used to get the collective energies and widths as well as the energy range considered experimentally might differ from the one we used .    interestingly enough , the sly4 functional gives collective energies that are systematically higher compared to the skm * case by almost @xmath93 mev for @xmath94 .",
    "it should be noted that a @xmath93 mev difference , in view of desired accuracy for edf , is significant enough so that the gqr might become a global criteria for the validity of a given functional parametrization .",
    "bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_exp_e2_is ] , illustrates that the present mean - field calculation completely misses the fragmentation of the strength .",
    "the strength function is slightly fragmented for light nuclei but for medium and heavy nuclei ( @xmath95 ) , the high lying collective energy essentially corresponds to a single collective energy without any spreading .",
    "this is clearly at variance with the experimental observation where a rather significant fragmentation is systematically observed .",
    "this discrepancy is not surprising since a mean - field theory is expected to reproduce one - body observables but can not really include two - body effects . in the case of giant resonances , the fragmentation of the strength reflects the coupling to complex internal degrees of freedom like the coupling to two - particles two - holes induced by in - medium collisions @xcite or the coupling low lying surface modes @xcite .",
    "see for instance the extensive discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite . as it is already known from qrpa calculation",
    ", the inclusion of pairing correlations does not cure this problem .",
    "last , it should be noted that the collectivity of the gqr state , while always significant , continuously decreases as the mass increases .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : frac_eswr ] where the percentage of ewsr above 7.5 mev is shown as a function of the mass of the nucleus .",

    "[ fig : comp_exp_e2_iv ] .",
    "the collective energies of both functionals are in global agreement with the experiments except for one very light nucleus .",
    "regarding the width , the situation is slightly different compared to the is case since the collective response is always fragmented .",
    "the fragmentation obtained with the mean - field theory accounts approximately for half of the fragmentation observed experimentally .",
    "it is interesting to note that the repartition of the ewsr between the low and high energy sector in the iv case is completely opposite compared to the is - gqr .",
    "the non negligible fraction of ewsr sum rule observed at low energy for light nuclei @xmath96 vanishes for larger mass leading to almost 100% of the strength at high energy in heavy nuclei .          the is and iv - gqr energy can be appropriately fitted using a polynomial expansion in power of @xmath97 , i.e. @xmath98 truncating at second order provides a rather good description of the is - gqr but fails to reproduce the iv - gqr . in all cases ,",

    "thanks to the previous analysis , the local fluctuations of the mean energy can be de - convoluted from the average by considering the quantity @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the collective energy while @xmath103 is computed from formula ( [ eq : pol ] ) .",

    "as expected , we do observe several maximums that exactly match the location of shell closure at magic numbers ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) .",
    "this is due to the appearance of larger gaps in single - particle effective energies inducing larger energies of particle - hole excitations from which the collective states are built up .",
    "interestingly enough the deviation @xmath104 also presents some minimums that turn out to be exactly located at the position of the harmonic oscillators magic numbers without spin - orbit ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) . as we will see below , this effect could be understood as a competition between the conserved parity during the excitation and the pairing correlations .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that one of the main effect of pairing on dynamics is to induce partial occupation numbers of single - particle orbitals .",
    "this effect can already be accounted for at the mean - field level without pairing by considering a statistical ensemble of independent particles instead of a slater determinant . in this case , considering an open shell nucleus , the occupation numbers of the last occupied shell are not anymore zero or one but are equal to the number of nucleons in the shell divided by the shell degeneracy , this is the so - called equal - filling approximation . for the reason discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this approximation can be regarded as the no - pairing reference for tdhf+bcs .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_foa_td_hf ] and [ fig : comp_iv ] , the is - gqr and iv - gqr responses are displayed using different approximations for the evolution .",
    "two tdhf+bcs are considered , one where the occupation numbers and correlations are frozen ( frozen occupation approximation [ foa ] ) in time and one where the full tdhf+bcs equation of motion are solved in time .",
    "the foa has the advantage to respect the continuity equation contrary to tdhf+bcs @xcite .",
    "note that since here we consider a single system , this drawback of tdhf+bcs is not crucial . the response function with pairing are compared with the tdhf+equal - filling approximation case .",
    "the first remarkable aspect , is that the two calculations with pairing , i.e. the complete one and the foa , are exactly on top of each others .",
    "this confirms that in the tdhf+bcs limit , the main effect of pairing on small amplitude vibrations stems from the initial ground state correlations .",
    "let us now consider the difference between the tdhf+bcs case and the no - pairing limit .",
    "we focus first on the high energy region ( @xmath111 mev ) . to quantify further the pairing effect on high lying states , the main peak collective energy of the is - gqr",
    "is systematically reported for the sn isotopes in top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_bcs_ef_sn ] and for the three types of evolutions .    sn nucleus . ]     for the iv - gqr . ]    since at shell closure , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , the hf - bcs ground state identifies with the hf solution , the three theories are exactly on top of each other .",
    "as n goes from @xmath112 to @xmath113 , all theories predicts a decrease of the gqr energy consistent with the expected @xmath97 dependence .",
    "however , while the theory with pairing presents a smooth u shape , the tdhf approach is slightly lower and has a minimum at @xmath114 , that corresponds to one of the magic number of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) without spin - orbit .",
    "this anomaly observed in the tdhf case , is located at the ho shell closure corresponding to the @xmath115 shell , can be directly assigned to a parity effect .",
    "indeed , the collective excitations have definite parities , here @xmath116 .",
    "when the number of neutrons increases , the parity of occupied single - particle states change from positive ( below @xmath114 ) to negative ( above @xmath114 ) leading to a sudden change in the particle - hole state on which the collective excitation is built up .",
    "the u shape observed in the tdhf+bcs case can be seen as a fossil signature of the parity effect .",
    "indeed , due to pairing correlations , occupation numbers are more fragmented around the fermi energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_bcs_ef_sn ] , the quantity @xmath117 is shown .",
    "this quantity measure the fragmentation of single - particle occupation numbers and falls down to zero when all occupation numbers are equal to zero or one .",
    "this is the case , in the bcs approximation at ( spin - orbit ) magic number or in the tdhf case when a sub - shell is fully occupied .",
    "again , except around magic numbers , the fragmentation is more pronounced in the bcs compared to the tdhf case . in particular , around @xmath114 , single - particle states are partially occupied in bcs .",
    "accordingly , the anomaly observed in tdhf is reduced but still occurs trough the u shape . for the skm * functional the u shape is less pronounced because the fragmentation is larger than with sly4 .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : e2_sly4_shell_n ] , the u shape that results from the competition between parity conservation and paring is observed all along the mass table ( down arrows ) but tends to be less pronounced as the mass increases .",
    "this quantity gives a measure of the fragmentation of single - particle occupations numbers around the fermi energy .",

    "the tdhf+bcs results with skm * ( brown crosses ) are also shown for comparison . in top panel , the experimental values from @xcite ( blue open triangles )",
    "is also shown for comparison . ]    in any case , we see that the difference between the case with or without pairing is less than the difference observed using different functionals ( sly4 and skm * here ) .",
    "our conclusion is that the main source of uncertainty in the prediction of high lying gqr collective states stems from the functional used in the mean - field channel .",
    "we also see that all approximations lies above the experimental values .",
    "this might appear as a failure of the theory .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that correlations beyond the present approach , that account for instance for ph - phonon coupling are expected to shift most likely down the collective frequencies @xcite .      pairing",
    "is known to play a crucial role on the low lying @xmath63 states ( see for instance discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) at least due to the induced fragmentation of the single - particle occupation numbers near the fermi energy . while the high energy sector of the response are only slightly dependent on the treatment of ( i ) pairing effects ( ii ) dynamical reorganization of single - particle occupation numbers , the situation is completely different in the low energy part .",

    "@xcite .",
    "with all these curves at hand some interesting conclusions can be drawn .",
    "first , comparing the results obtained with the two skyrme functionals , we see that for low masses , @xmath146 , both functionals agree with each others .",
    "however , as the mass increases , a significant difference can be observed in the symmetry energy extracted with ( [ eq : isiv ] ) .",
    "this difference can obviously be traced back in the difference observed in the collective peak energies .",
    "it should be noted , that since the symmetry energy is calculated as a difference of energies of collective peaks .",
    "such differences might still lead to the same value for @xmath147 .",
    "however , we see that the is peak in skm * is systematically lower compared to sly4 while for the iv peak it is the opposite .",
    "therefore , the differences in energies add them up and cooperate to further show up in the finite system symmetry energy .",
    "the symmetry energy extracted from the gqr are systematically lower than the one obtained analytically in infinite nuclear matter .",
    "in particular , analytical expressions lead to higher symmetry energies in sly4 ( dashed line ) compared to skm * ( dot - dashed line ) while the opposite is seen from the gqr based symmetry energy .",
    "it could also be noted that a rather significant difference is observed between @xmath148 and the gqr based symmetry energy . besides the absolute value , the slope is also different between the infinite system and finite system cases .",
    "these differences clearly point out subtle finite size effects when eq .",
    "( [ eq : isiv ] ) is used , deserving more studies that are out of the scope of the present work .",
    "applying formula ( [ eq : isiv ] ) with experimental collective energies already gives gross properties of the symmetry energy as a function of mass .",
    "the main source of uncertainty is coming from the very few measurements made for the iv - gqr and from their large error bars .",
    "nevertheless we see that the experimentally deduced symmetry energy is globally in agreement with the skm * prediction for density above @xmath149 that corresponds to @xmath150 while it is not with the sly4 case . to illustrate the impact of improving the measurement precision , we have artificially reduced the error bars down to 500 kev ( light green filled area ) .",
    "the is and iv response in spherical nuclei has been obtained over a large set of nuclei using the tdhf+bcs approach based on different skyrme energy density functional .",
    "the present study , is first a proof of principle that such an approach is fast and simple enough to make possible qualitative and quantitative systematics over the nuclear chart .",
    "it is shown , that the tdedf method globally reproduces the average evolution of the main collective energy but , due to the missing two - body effects , can not reproduce its spreading width . a careful analysis ,",
    "has shown that the mean - collective energy does depends rather significantly on the skyrme functional .",
    "the dependence is large enough to eventually use the gqr as a criteria of selection of the functional itself . in the present work",
    ", it is shown that the skm * reproduces much better the experimental is - gqr than the sly4 functional .",
    "besides the global effects , the local fluctuations due to shell structure effects , the parity conservation as well pairing are discussed .",
    "it is shown that all these effects might contributes locally to the fluctuations around the average properties .",
    "while around magic numbers , the shell stabilization induces an increase of the gqr energy , in between magic numbers , the gqr presents a u - shape that is the result of the competition between pairing and parity effects .",
    "the possibility to describe low lying @xmath63 state with our time - dependent approach is discussed .",
    "it is shown that the tdhf+bcs method is able to globally describe the energy of the first @xmath63 state but strongly underestimate the transition operator .    finally , the possible extraction of the density dependence of the symmetry energy from is- and iv - gqr is discussed .",
    "we show that large scale calculation like the one presented here can provide interesting information on the symmetry energy but requires a better understanding of finite size effects and would benefit from high precision measurement of the iv - gqr .",
    "all response functions used in the present work can be downloaded with the supplement material @xcite .",
