    "although our model arrives at a number of conclusions that are developed by combining three different physical theories , the assumptions and approximations used in each are well developed in the condensed matter physics and biophysics literature . here , we summarize the main physical assumptions and review the mathematical approximations used :    @xmath324 _ steady - state and equilibrium assumptions _ : ribosome diffusion and motion along the mrna",
    "are treated within steady state , while the configurational distribution of the mrna polymer is not directly coupled to ribosome diffusion or motion , and is considered in thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the inverse `` harmonic distance '' @xmath93 is determined from _ equilibrium _ mrna configurational distributions , but parametrically influence the nonequilibrium steady - state processes of diffusion and the tasep .",
    "equilibration times of unentangled polymers and diffusion times over the length of the mrna are on the order of milliseconds to seconds , while the relaxation to steady - states in the tasep occur over seconds to on the order of a couple minutes .",
    "thus , on experimental time scales longer than these , transients in the ribosome throughput have dissipated , and the steady - state and equilibrium assumptions are appropriate .",
    "one might be tempted to formulate the specific mechanisms in terms of the common notions of reactions being kinetically or thermodynamically controlled . in this biochemical terminology ,",
    "the tasep is kinetically controlled , since the ribosomes take irreversible steps as each amino acid is added during elongation .",
    "the mrna configurations , computed under equilibrium conditions , are by definition thermodynamically controlled .",
    "however , each of the proposed mechanisms is a simple , single , independent process , the notion of kinetic control _ versus _ thermodynamic control is irrelevant . within each mechanism , there are no alternate `` reaction paths '' or outcomes for kinetic or thermodynamic control to apply . however , it is possible that the mrna conformations and the binding protein - mediated loop formation does not reach equilibrium on the time scale of measurements of ribosome throughput .",
    "this possibility is also discussed in the experimental consequences and proposed measurements section .",
    "@xmath324 _ gaussian chain polymer model for mrna _ : unlike trna , the coding regions of mrna is relatively devoid of secondary structure .",
    "the single - stranded mrna is treated using standard statistical physics of polymers that assumes nonintersecting random walks of step size defined by the polymer persistence length .",
    "for single - stranded mrna without adsorbed proteins , the persistence length @xmath325 bases .",
    "when loaded with large ribosomes , we assume that the persistence length is on the order of the ribosome size and that it is approximately uniform along the chain . although the ribosome loading might varying slightly along the chain , this variation occurs only near the ends and does not appreciably affect the equilibrium end - to - end distributions .",
    "although we treat only phantom ( nonintersecting ) polymers , effects due to the binding of finite - sized pabs and cap proteins are explicitly treated when computing the end - to - end distribution functions in the small distance regime where steric exclusion of the end proteins are important .",

    "@xmath324 _ equal particle and step sizes _ : ribosomes moving along mrna are treated with a discrete tasep where the step size is exactly equal to the particle diameter .",
    "however , ribosomes are large and occlude @xmath34 codons so that they move one particle diameter only after about @xmath326 steps ( amino acid transfers ) . nonetheless , the qualitative behavior of the currents for different @xmath35 remain unchanged . for the sake of simplicity and clear analytic expressions ( eqs .",
    "[ kstar ] , [ bstar ] , and [ jexactb ] ) , we have restricted our analysis to @xmath327 .",

    "it is known that @xmath12 can vary by factors of 2 - 10 @xcite , depending on the codon in question and the availability of the associated trna . as a first step ,",
    "we have simply assumed a scenario in which the elongation rates do not vary appreciably over the coding region .",
    "more elaborate models that include specified elongation rates @xmath328 across the mrna chain would require extensive simulations for each realization of @xmath329 .",
    "@xmath324 _ bulk diffusion limited adsorption _ : ribosomes , or the relevant rate - limiting component of a ribosome , diffuses in bulk and directly attaches to the initiation site .",
    "capture of the ribosome by the initiation end of the mrna may occur in a two - step process of nonspecific adsorption from bulk , followed by linear diffusion along a segment of the mrna , before ultimately interacting specifically with the initiation site @xcite .",
    "although studied in the context of linear diffusion and search along dna @xcite , direct evidence for such scanning mechanisms in the initiation of mrna translation has been hard to obtain @xcite .",
    "for example , secondary structure in the form of small mrna knots near the 5 region must be melted before efficient ribosome scanning can occur @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one - dimensional diffusion of ribosomes along the mrna near the initiation sight _ is _ implicitly included in our model .",
    "the conjectured scanning mechanisms suggest that ribosomes scan locally near the start codon @xcite .",
    "thus , if ribosome recycling via diffusion through the bulk is rate - limiting , the scanning region near the initiation where the linear diffusion occurs can be considered as binding region of larger _ effective _ capture radius @xmath75 .",
    "consider identical particles that are driven through a long one - dimensional lattice of @xmath330 sites .",

    ", @xmath35 consecutive steps must be taken .",

    ". a mean field model for the asymmetric exclusion process containing particles that occupy @xmath35 substrate lattice sites ( mrna codons ) has been solved .",

    "[ phase0 ] ) as the tasep with particles of size @xmath327 .",
    "that is , for large entrance and exit rates , there is a maximal current phase ( iii ) , bounded by low ( i ) and high ( ii ) density phases .",
    "the effects of increasing the particle size to @xmath333 only quantitatively changes the values of the currents in each of these phases , and can be straightforwardly integrated into the present study .",

    "<S> the parameters in the tasep are the internal hopping rates and the injection and extraction rates at the initiation and termination sites , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since ribosome components that diffuse in bulk must adsorb on the initiation site , the injection rate used in the tasep will be proportional to the local concentration of the rate - limiting ribosome . </S>",
    "<S> ribosomes that reach the termination site desorb and reenter the pool of diffusing ribosomes . </S>",
    "<S> the distance between the termination end and the initiation site , when ribosomes are released , can thus influence the absorption rate and hence the overall translation rate . </S>",
    "<S> the initiation - termination end - to - end distance distribution can be estimated with basic polymer physics . </S>",
    "<S> the end - to - end distance distribution can include effects such as specific binding of poly(a ) associated proteins with the 5 cap , thereby forming a loop , bringing the initiation and termination sites into close proximity . </S>",
    "<S> although our model applies only to cytoplasmic mrna translation , many of its components can also be adapted to treat mrna adsorption on endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) and er - assisted translation .    </S>",

    "<S> , we will see that fluctuations in these physical mechanisms are uncorrelated with each other . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to consider simple steady - states where time or ensemble averages of the tasep , ribosome diffusion in the cytoplasm , and the mrna chain conformations are uncorrelated and can be taken independently of each other . </S>",

    "<S> a maximum occurs when initially , as @xmath146 is increased , the decrement in @xmath292 can not keep up with the enhancement in local ribosome concentration due to the increasing likelihood of loop formation ( _ i.e. _ the shifting of the high current phase boundary to lower @xmath292 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , if @xmath293 is sufficiently small , @xmath292 eventually diminishes , such that one arrives at the low density , low current regime . </S>",

    "<S> since it is possible for diffusion and ribosome elongation along the mrna to reach steady - state before the mrna chain reaches conformational equilibrium ( in the presence of loop - forming proteins ) , a possibility exists for `` kinetic _ versus _ thermodynamic control '' for the measured ribosome throughput . </S>",

    "<S> conversely , if the the mrna chain happens to be in a looped conformation and the free energy barrier for dissociation of the loop is large , the measured current may be that corresponding to only a closed mrna loop ( mimicking the case @xmath310 ) . </S>",

    "<S> only when @xmath146 or @xmath313 are large does ribosome recycling get significantly enhanced by loop formation . </S>",
    "<S> transient measurements , as well as fluctuations of the measured throughput , is beyond the scope of the paper .    </S>",
    "<S> * summary *    we have constructed a simple model and road map for the possible physical effects at play during translation . the model incorporates driven diffusive motion which obeys exclusion statistics for ribosomes along mrna . </S>",
    "<S> the initiation and termination sites are considered as sinks and sources of ribosome concentration , described by the steady - state diffusion equation ( laplace s equation ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average conformations of the mrna chain define the typical initiation - termination distance which determines the how terminated ribosomes directly diffuse back to the initiation site and affect the local concentration there . </S>",
    "<S> this local concentration is a parameter ( the injection rate ) in the exclusion process , but also depends on the overall ribosome throughput ( the strength of the sink and source ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the current @xmath27 needs to be solved self - consistently . </S>",
    "<S> direct cooperative enhancement of kinetic binding and `` off '' rates were also incorporated . </S>",
    "<S> although it is thought that the rate - limiting step is binding and initiation of ribosomes at the initiation site @xcite , the fact that polysomes have been found to exist in both high and low ribosome occupancy states suggests that under physiological conditions , steady - state ribosome fluxes can span the regimes defined by the phase diagrams depicted figs . </S>",

    "<S> the rate limiting step is the off rate @xmath194 which controls the steady - state flux ( cf . phase ( ii ) in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phase0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> ribosome depletion by the sink and replenishment by the source can drastically affect the constant @xmath315 phase diagram , as shown in figures [ phase1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the critical values of @xmath241 that define the the left boundary of the maximal current phase ( in the @xmath26 limit ) is most sensitive to the dimensionless parameter @xmath228 when @xmath316 . for sufficiently small @xmath228 , </S>",
    "<S> the effective injection rate can not reach @xmath242 and the maximal current phase can not be attained . when @xmath317 , the explicit currents were computed from eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ jexact ] and plotted in figure [ jexactfig ] . </S>",
    "<S> given the possibility of cooperative interactions in looped mrna configurations , we have also found a maximum in ribosome throughput as a function of loop - binding energy @xmath146 .    </S>",
    "<S> many molecular and chemical details have been neglected . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned , we have ignored the fact that numerous components must assemble before initiation and have modelled only an `` effective '' rate - limiting component . </S>",
    "<S> the surface concentration parameter @xmath87 in our model would be an effective concentration reflecting the local density of ribosomes capable of initiation . </S>",
    "<S> proposed mechanisms of ribosome scanning @xcite , whereby ribosomes attach to segments of mrna and undergo one - dimensional diffusion before encountering the initiation site , can be adequately modeled with the present approach if one assumes that the rate - limiting step is initial adsorption onto an mrna segment . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have assumed that the ribosomes do not detach from the mrna until they reach the termination site and that their forward hopping rates are uniform across the whole coding region . finally , in our simple polymer model </S>",
    "<S> , we have neglected both self - avoidance ( of both chain - chain and chain - ribosome exclusion ) and the fact that the effective persistence length may varying along the mrna , depending on the local ribosome density .    despite these simplifying assumptions </S>",
    "<S> , we find that _ </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively _ , subtle control mechanisms can come into play , depending on biologically reasonable physical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> although there are numerous experiments probing translation , both _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> , many different systems and physical conditions are employed , rendering quantitative comparison with measurements difficult . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , our model suggests new measurements that can be used to qualitatively probe the various physical hypotheses and exhibit our predicted physical trends . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the effective @xmath74 can be varied in a number of ways to test with the predicted current regimes . </S>",
    "<S> occupancy along the mrna can also be correlated with the high , low , and intermediate density phases . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the noncoded regions between the elongation factors and the initiation site , and the termination site and the poly(a ) tail - bound pab can be varied to test possible cooperative interactions defined by eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ keff ] . since the loop formation probability @xmath318 depends on the total statistical length @xmath319 , which is dominated by the length of the coding region ( @xmath320 ) , varying @xmath284 and @xmath102 would affect , through the likelihood of molecular contact in the looped states , only @xmath292 and @xmath321 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the actual probability of loop formation @xmath318 , and hence @xmath94 , would not be significantly affected . </S>",
    "<S> chemical modification of the elongation factors or the pab s _ would _ affect @xmath146 , and hence @xmath322 , and @xmath94 through @xmath323 . </S>",
    "<S> using micromanipulation techniques @xcite , it might also be possible to fix the initiation - termination distance _ in vitro_.    numerous extensions to the presented models can be straightforwardly incorporated to more precisely model the chemical and microphysical processes . </S>",
    "<S> codon and trna concentration - dependent variations in the internal transition rates @xmath12 @xcite , as well as random detachment processes , can be implemented using simple lattice simulations . </S>",
    "<S> sites along the mrna chain at which ribosomes pause can be treated as `` defects '' in a tasep and the whole process can be treated with mean - field theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> multiple coding regions in prokaryotic translation ( shine - dalgarno sequences ) can be modeled as a sequence of initiation ( sinks ) and termination ( sources ) sites . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , cap - independent initiation at internal ribosome entry sites @xcite ( ires ) can also be treated as sinks within our basic model . </S>",
    "<S> translation of er - associated mrna further involve ribosomes that attach the mrna at certain points on the er membrane . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , one expects that density of cytoplasmic and er - bound ribosomes to have a strong effect on localization of mrna to er and overall translation rates . </S>",
    "<S> one can also consider cases where the protein product itself is a ribosome product necessary for its self - translation ; this processes would result in initially autocatalytic protein production . </S>",
