    "the _ trace _ satellite has provided impressive movies showing the dramatic phenomena that accompany the emergence of magnetized plasma in the solar atmosphere @xcite . initially the emerging flux adopts the shape of a small system of loops in the corona , with their ends anchored in two localized flux patches in the photosphere .",
    "as the loop system grows in size it starts feeling the presence of the ambient coronal magnetic field .",
    "this eventually leads to profound changes in the geometry and topology of the magnetic flux systems , with the emerging field quickly establishing links to the coronal field .",
    "this process can take place only through magnetic reconnection that , at the same time , is responsible for significant localized energy release .",
    "this provides the basic mechanism to create the several million degree plasma structures observed by the _",
    "yohkoh _ soft x - ray telesope above emerging flux regions and the cooler loop structures observed by _ trace _ to connect emerging regions to the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the first numerical mhd studies of the emergence scenario were two - dimensional models @xcite .",
    "these experiments showed the formation of high - temperature jets , which were tentatively identified with x - ray jets .",
    "however , the geometry of the complex structures @xcite resulting from flux emergence is intrinsically three - dimensional . a number of recent three - dimensional numerical experiments ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) have studied the rise of buoyant magnetic flux tubes initially below ( but close to ) the photosphere into a non - magnetized corona . however , the solar corona has a space - filling and dynamically important magnetic field .",
    "hence , the rise and expansion of newly emerging magnetic flux can not proceed unimpeded @xcite .    here",
    "we present first results of three - dimensional mhd emergence experiments that include a large - scale coronal magnetic field modeled , for simplicity , as a uniform horizontal field ( see @xcite for details regarding the mhd equations and the numerical approach ) .",
    "the experiments reveal a number of strikingly simple features such as the appearance of an arch - shaped high current density sheet containing the reconnection sites ; change of connectivity of the field lines that approach the current sheet following regular patterns ; formation of high - velocity plasma outflows emerging from the reconnection region ; and plasma heating associated with the reconnection site .",
    "they are discussed in the following sections .",
    "the initial setup of the experiments follows previous papers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , in which a horizontal , magnetic flux tube with twisted field lines of constant positive pitch is placed @xmath1 mm below the photosphere in a highly stratified environment .",
    "the stratification includes an isothermal photosphere ( thickness @xmath2 mm , at @xmath3 k ) , an isothermal corona ( at @xmath4 k , with thickness @xmath5 mm ) , a transition region with a steep temperature gradient joining them , and , at the bottom of the box , an adiabatically stratified region of @xmath6 mm thickness that simulates the uppermost layers of the solar interior . unlike the previous three - dimensional models , an initially uniform and horizontal magnetic field",
    "is included in the coronal part of the domain with a field strength such that @xmath7 and an orientation , relative to the tube axis , that is used as an input parameter . to initiate the experiment ,",
    "a density deficit is incorporated into the tube that is maximum at the center and goes to zero when moving along the tube axis toward either boundary of the box .",
    "the buoyancy force , therefore , causes the development of a rising magnetic loop in the central part of the box , which reaches the photosphere some @xmath8 minutes after initiation of the experiment .",
    "once in the atmosphere , the magnetic pressure drives the further rise of the magnetized plasma through the transition region and into the corona : the latter is reached after about @xmath9 minutes .",
    "the rise results in a huge expansion of the plasma : the rising loop adopts the shape of a large , somewhat flattened ball , or hill , with the field lines showing a fan - like shape ( fig .  [ fig_plasmahill ] ) . on reaching the corona",
    ", it bumps against the coronal field . during the rise phase",
    ", the field line windings increase their radius , and , following simple laws of flux conservation @xcite , the magnetic field at the loop top becomes almost perpendicular to the initial tube axis ( i.e. , @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the standard polar angle measured in any horizontal plane from the positive @xmath12-axis : see fig .",
    "[ fig_plasmahill ] ) .",
    "when new magnetic flux emerges in the vicinity of existing active regions , the angle between the emerging and coronal fields can take any value . to see the impact of the relative orientation on the field evolution , we have conducted a series of experiments with the direction of the initial coronal magnetic field",
    "( that we label using its polar angle , @xmath13 ) being changed from @xmath14 to @xmath15 in steps . seen from the top of the upcoming plasma , the first case corresponds to the two flux systems being approximately antiparallel , whereas in the latter they are roughly parallel .",
    "the numerical simulations reveal that the dynamical evolution of the resulting interaction between the emerging and the coronal flux critically depends on the relative horizontal angle ( 180-@xmath13 ) between the two flux systems at the time of first contact , as explained in the following sections .",
    "when the emerging flux hits the coronal field , the latter gets pushed upward and the interface between them becomes dented , thus creating a hill - shaped structure protruding into the corona . in the case when the two fields are aligned ( @xmath16 ) , no reconnection can initially occur and the emerging field continues to push its way upward , thus increasing the height of the hill .",
    "initially , the coronal field is just bent upward with a small sideways expansion .",
    "however , it is energetically favorable for those field lines to slide down the hill so that they end up passing around it at nearly constant height .",
    "the rearrangement of the coronal field occurs on the local alfvn timescale , which is much faster than the timescale of rise . only at a later stage",
    "does the nonalignment of the two flux systems become sufficient for some reconnection to occur .    in the opposite limit ( @xmath14 ) , the two flux systems are nearly antiparallel . here the discontinuous jump in the magnetic field between either side of the interface initially yields a dome - shaped current surface . after a transient evolution",
    ", the current surface concentrates into a rather narrow and curved sheet arching over the summit of the emerging plasma ( fig .",
    "[ fig_current_arch ] , _ left panel _ ) .",
    "this current arch is contained in a vertical plane that is rotated some @xmath17 away from the @xmath18 plane , an effect of the nonperfect alignment of field lines of the two systems .",
    "going now to cases with an intermediate initial orientation of the ambient coronal field ( i.e. , @xmath13 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , the current sheet continues to adopt the form of an arch that passes through the summit point of the emerging hill ( fig .",
    "[ fig_current_arch ] , _ right panel _ ) .",
    "now , however , that the vertical midplane of the arch is rotated with respect to the @xmath21 plane by an angle that increases nearly following a linear law with @xmath13 , reaching @xmath22 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "this behavior can be understood as follows : the nonreconnecting component of the field changes direction as @xmath26 with its magnitude the projection of the field components onto this direction .",
    "hence , to lowest order approximation , the magnitude of the reconnecting field components changes as @xmath27 .",
    "given a constant thickness of the current sheet , the electric current inside it will change in the same manner .",
    "these assumptions are generally supported by the experiments .",
    "for example , the peak current density , reached at the summit of the hill , is seen to follow quite closely a @xmath27 law ( with the peak value reaching @xmath28 a @xmath29 ) .",
    "the high current intensity is associated with intense ohmic heating .",
    "again , the peak temperature in the current sheet shows a strong dependence with the initial angle : for @xmath30 , the maximum @xmath31 is @xmath32 k , decreasing to @xmath33 k for @xmath34 and @xmath35 k for @xmath23 .",
    "let us consider in some detail the physics taking place at the interface between emerging plasma and ambient field for the antiparallel case ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) , which provides the simplest configuration .",
    "[ fig_2dslices ] shows a global three - dimensional view with the help of a vertical and a horizontal two - dimensional cut .",
    "the cuts contain a color map of the modulus of the velocity , as well as the full magnetic vector . for clarity , one - half of the arched current sheet",
    "is also shown ( colored green ) .",
    "reconnection is occurring all along the current arch , with field lines of opposite sense being pressed together from above and below , and the reconnected field lines going away sideways from the site . in a constant @xmath36 plane close to the summit point of the plasma hill ,",
    "the magnetic structure is comparable to a bent two - dimensional @xmath12-point that has collapsed into two @xmath37-points connected by a current sheet through which reconnection proceeds @xcite .",
    "the effects of reconnection are particularly apparent at the edges of the current sheet in both the horizontal and vertical cuts : here , the reconnected field lines detach from the current sheet and are ejected sideways , with the associated launching of hot high - velocity plasma jets . at only a short distance from the current sheet ( e.g. , several hundred kilometers in the figure ) , the plasma flows almost along the coronal magnetic field lines .",
    "high velocities , in excess of @xmath38 km s@xmath39 , are reached both close to the reconnection site as well as in the higher part of the jet , with the peak velocities typically reaching the local alfvn velocity . completing the 3d image of the outflows",
    "one can see that the high - speed outflow volumes have the shape of two curved caps , one on each side of the current arch , with their crest becoming asymptotically horizontal .      the relative simplicity of the structure described in the previous section and glimpsed in fig .",
    "[ fig_2dslices ] is lost when considering a case with an arbitrary orientation of the initial coronal field . as a representative example we take @xmath40 , which still allows for abundant electric current density , heating and reconnection .",
    "[ fig_composite ] shows the global configuration and the relative position of the current sheet ( _ red arching stripe _ ) , outflow jets , ambient coronal field ( _ thin straight blue lines _ ) , and the magnetic tube still buried below the photosphere ( _ spiraling yellow field lines _ ) .",
    "the vertical midplane of the current sheet subtends in this case an angle of approximately @xmath41 deg with the @xmath21 plane .",
    "the field lines shown belong to four different classes : ( 1 ) blue coronal field lines , ( 2 ) yellow flux tube field lines , and ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) red and green reconnected field lines connecting the flux tube to the coronal field .",
    "reconnection is occurring all along the current sheet , and as before , high - velocity outflows are being launched away from the sheet .",
    "figure  [ fig_composite ] shows the location of maximum velocity of those jets , using isosurfaces of the velocity magnitude : they are visible as two curved caps that point away from the current sheet close to its upper level .",
    "velocities of close to @xmath42 km s@xmath39 are reached .",
    "all along the jets there is only a very limited reduction in velocity , indicating that reconnection jets will be seen over very large distances in the corona .",
    "reconnection in the general case has the distinctive feature ( when compared with the antiparallel case ; sec .",
    "[ sec_antiparallel ] ) of being essentially three - dimensional in nature .",
    "for example , two of the sets of coronal field lines in fig .",
    "[ fig_composite ] ( _ red and green _ ) traverse the current sheet at its summit and connect the coronal magnetic system with the magnetic flux tube : notice the clear nonalignment of the coronal and tube magnetic field on either side of the current sheet .",
    "because of the nonzero resistivity , the orientation of the field changes smoothly through the current sheet , so that around the summit point of the arch , the field line system resembles a smoothed rotational discontinuity .",
    "the magnetic pressure decreases toward the center of the sheet , with the magnetic field here containing only the nonreconnecting part of the initial magnetic field vectors .",
    "pressure balance is achieved via a gas pressure maximum at the center of the sheet . in a general 3d reconnection situation",
    ", there is a finite noneconnecting component at the center of the sheet , and the gas pressure maximum is not too pronounced . toward the flanks of the sheet ,",
    "however , the nonreconnecting component is small and the magnetic pressure can become @xmath43 times smaller than the ambient magnetic pressure .",
    "the field topology can be illustrated by drawing field lines close to the lateral end of the current sheet ( fig .",
    "[ fig_reconnection_site ] ) .",
    "four distinct types are shown together with the full current sheet .",
    "both the red and dark blue field lines are the direct result of reconnection between the emerging and coronal fields .",
    "they highlight the asymmetry between the two sides of the reconnection site : the red field lines are highly curved close to the reconnection point and , hence , will generate a faster outflow than the less curved dark blue field lines .",
    "the yellow field lines belong to the emerging flux system within the plasma hill , and have not yet undergone any reconnection .",
    "the light blue field lines , finally , are part of the ambient coronal system but pass close to the reconnection site .",
    "the traditional reconnection picture is linked with the concept that the magnetic field lines break near the center of the current sheet . as seen here",
    ", this need not happen for less symmetric situations than assumed in the simple 2d scenarios .",
    "in fact , in our experiments the flanks of the current sheet are maintained by the rapid change in orientation of the red reconnected field lines .",
    "moreover , we consistently find the reconnection point located far out to one side of the current sheet , all of which indicates a departure from simple two - dimensional properties .",
    "the present experiments show that interaction between the emerging flux and the existing coronal magnetic field is unavoidable and that it can cause a highly dynamical evolution .",
    "they also show that the efficiency of the interaction between the two flux systems critically depends on the relative orientation between their magnetic field components .",
    "fast magnetic reconnection can be delayed when their orientations are nearly parallel , while it is easily initiated when they are nearly antiparallel .",
    "an arch - shaped current sheet is formed ; all along its rim the reconnection generates high - velocity outflows , which are seen propagating horizontally away from the emergence site in the ambient coronal field .",
    "the experiments also show that nonsymmetric features arise when the field vector of the two flux systems is not contained in the same vertical plane .",
    "furthermore it is found that simple extensions of the magnetic reconnection process in traditional two - dimensional models can not accomodate the fully three - dimensional features occurring in the reconnection in these experiments .    scaling the model to solar conditions",
    ", the experiment covers a horizontal domain of @xmath44 x @xmath45 mm@xmath46 , corresponding to the size of a small active region .",
    "the emergence phase into the corona covers only about 30 minutes .",
    "nonetheless , the reconnection jets obtained in the most favorable cases have high velocities , with peak values of the order of @xmath47 km s@xmath39 . at the same time",
    ", the magnetic dissipation heats the plasma significantly in the current sheet , with temperatures in the antiparallel case reaching close to @xmath48 k. higher numerical resolution - lower effective resistivity - will increase the energy dissipation in the current sheet and with that the peak temperature .",
    "this will be countered by including anisotropic heat conduction and optically thin radiation in the energy equation - the task for a future investigation .",
    "the results obtained in our experiments compare favorably with observations , where typical jet velocities @xcite are between @xmath49 and @xmath50 km s@xmath39 , with an average velocity @xmath42 km s@xmath39 and where plasma temperatures of many million degrees are often reported in connection with fast energy release events , such as flares .",
