    "radial velocity surveys of nearby stars have been enormously successful in discovering extrasolar planets .",
    "these surveys have demonstrated that a significant fraction of the stars in the solar neighborhood have massive planets with orbital radii that are substantially smaller than jupiter s ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the engulfing of these planets by their parent stars is an inevitable outcome of stellar evolution ( either directly or due to tidal interaction ) in the red giant branch ( rgb ) or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the capture of planetary - mass companions has been suggested to be the potential cause for the high rotational velocities ( @xmath0  km  s@xmath1 ) observed in some field red giants @xcite and blue horizontal branch stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the present work",
    "we examine specifically the effects of planet / brown dwarf `` swallowing '' on the rotation rates of and mass loss from giants",
    ". in particular , we estimate the expected statistics of influenced stars .",
    "when a star in the rgb or agb phase engulfs a planet / brown dwarf the latter deposits its angular momentum into the giant s envelope . the resulting rotation frequency , as a fraction of the critical stellar rotation frequency @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the stellar mass and radius respectively ) is given by @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the companion mass , @xmath7 is the mass of the giant s envelope , @xmath8 is the star s moment of inertia and @xmath9 is the initial separation between the giant and the companion . since stars like the sun rotate only at a fraction of a percent of their critical rate ( on the main sequence ) and this fraction is further reduced ( by conservation of angular momentum ) to @xmath10 as the stars ascend the rgb or agb , we see from eq .",
    "( 1 ) that even jupiter - mass planets can have a very significant effect on the rotation rate of late - type stars . even when the increase in central condensation is taken into account , typically , @xmath11 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the effects on mass loss rates are more difficult to estimate because they involve the processes of generation of magnetic activity ( especially in spots ) and mass loss via radiation pressure on molecules and dust , both of which are rather poorly understood .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown semi - quantitatively that the spiraling - in process of the companion inside the giant s envelope can result in a dynamo generation of a magnetic field @xcite .    here",
    "we shall adopt a simplified , more heuristic approach ( similar to that of * ? ? ? * ) to estimate at what rotation rates we can expect significant effects on mass loss .",
    "dynamo - generated magnetic fields are limited by the requirement that the amplification timescale @xmath12 be of the order of the buoyant rise time of magnetic flux tubes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in a typical stellar @xmath13 dynamo the amplification timescale is given approximately by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is determined by convection ( @xmath16 is the mixing length and @xmath17 the surface angular velocity ) , @xmath18 is the wave number and @xmath19 is a measure of differential rotation .",
    "the critical wave number @xmath20 below which dynamo waves are amplified is given by ( @xmath21 is the turbulent viscosity ) @xmath22 adopting the same values as zeldovich et  al .",
    "( 1983 ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the convective velocity , and taking the wave number to be equal to the critical one , we find @xmath26 for typical agb star parameters , @xmath27  km  s@xmath1 , @xmath28@xmath16@xmath29 , the obtained average amplification time is of the order of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the rotation period .",
    "the local rise time of a flux tube is given approximately by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the alfven speed , @xmath34 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath35 ( where @xmath36 is the radial distance from the center ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the local scaleheight and @xmath37 is the density .",
    "the density in the convective zone of an agb star can be well approximated by @xcite @xmath38 equating the flux tube rise time @xmath39 to the regeneration and amplification time @xmath12 yields a value for the magnetic field @xmath40 magnetic energy is thus being released at a rate @xmath41    the kinetic energy associated with the mass loss from an agb star is of order @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mass - loss rate and @xmath44 is the wind velocity .",
    "an examination of eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) reveals that for the companion to have an appreciable effect on mass loss ( i.e.  to have @xmath45 ) it must increase the angular momentum of the envelope ( and thereby @xmath46 ) by an order of magnitude ( or more ) .",
    "consequently , in our estimate of the fraction of stars that are affected significantly by planetary companions , we shall adopt as the defining condition @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the orbital angular momentum of the planet , and @xmath49 is the angular momentum of the star as it leaves the main sequence [ eq .",
    "( 2 ) ] . note that this is probably a reasonable criterion for the planet having a significant effect on stellar evolution even considering the uncertain nature of the effects on mass loss .",
    "in fact , given that the magnetic field in stellar spots can be @xmath50 times stronger than the average field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , condition  ( 11 ) may be too stringent , since even a field lower by an order of magnitude than that given by eq .",
    "( 8) will result in spots that are significantly cooler than their surroundings ( magnetic pressure larger than the photospheric pressure ) .",
    "we define the following quantities @xmath51 where @xmath9 is the orbital separation , @xmath52 is the minimum planetary mass , and @xmath53 is jupiter s mass . in fig .  1 we show the known 75 planets ( taken in january 2002 from the _ extrasolar planets encyclopaedia _ compiled by j.  schneider , at http://www.obspm.fr/encycl/encycl.html ) in the @xmath54@xmath55 plane . in planetary systems",
    "where more than one planet is known we mark the most massive planet by an asterisk , while the others are marked by the + sign .",
    "several authors have attempted recently to obtain unbiased distributions of planets as a function of @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in view of the uncertainties , we adopt the following simple form for the fraction of systems @xmath56 within a box @xmath57 ( for the parameter space indicated below ) @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 . here",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are parameters .",
    "this form is the same as the one used by @xcite , who found ( their figures  3 and  4 ) @xmath64 and @xmath65 . using the well populated parallelogram ( i.e.  excluding areas in the @xmath66 plane with large gaps ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) marked by lines  1 to  4 on figure  1 , we estimate @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "examining in addition the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and fitting where necessary their functional forms to ours , gives average values of @xmath28@xmath62@xmath69 and @xmath28@xmath63@xmath70 , which we shall now adopt .",
    "the value of @xmath61 can be determined for fixed values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the following way . from a sample of 1,200 stars discussed by vogt et  al .",
    "( 2002 ; where more details can be found ) 44  planets and 4  brown dwarfs have been detected . hence 3.7% of the surveyed stars were found to have planets .",
    "the 75 known extrasolar planets ( as of the end of january 2002 ) are distributed in 67  planetary systems . using this ratio",
    "we find that the fraction of stars being detected to harbor planetary systems is @xmath71% .",
    "if we examine the well populated area of figure  1 ( bounded by the four straight lines @xmath72 ; @xmath73 ; @xmath74 ; and @xmath75 ) , we find that out of the 67  planetary systems , 48 are inside this parallelogram .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath76% of the stars having their massive planet within this region .",
    "considering that the right side of this region is close to the detection limit ( no planets are found near @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) , we take the detection fraction within this region to be @xmath79% of all stars . for stars with a metallicity above solar , [ fe / h ]  @xmath80 ,",
    "the detection fraction is @xmath81 times higher than that for the entire sample @xcite .",
    "hence , in the same scaling - region the fraction is @xmath82% .",
    "the large increase with metallicity in the probability of harboring a planet was studied by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the latter author argues that most stars with a metallicity [ fe / h ]  @xmath83 have planets around them .",
    "we therefore take @xmath84 for all stars and @xmath85 for metal rich stars , and find the value of @xmath61 from the expression @xmath86 where the last equality was obtained by substituting the average values @xmath87 and @xmath88 .    in the previous section we derived as our condition for a significant effect on mass - loss from the parent star , @xmath89 .",
    "we noted , however , that it is possible that even a lower angular momentum might play some role , especially since the star loses angular momentum as it evolves @xcite .",
    "soker further argues that planets of masses as low as @xmath90 are sufficient to influence the mass loss _ geometry _ from agb stars .",
    "an indirect hint that even a relatively slow rotation may influence the mass loss rate comes from the distribution of stars on the horizontal branch in globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "@xcite show that the distribution of stars on the horizontal branch in the hr diagram can be explained by variations in the mass loss rate on the rgb , by a factor which depends on the metallicity ( ranging from 1.5 in metal rich gcs to @xmath91 in metal poor gcs ) .",
    "we should note that red horizontal branch stars also rotate @xcite .",
    "however , using the results of @xcite for m13 , @xcite showed that the average angular momentum of the progenitors of hotter horizontal branch stars is larger than that of cooler ones .",
    "it is thought that rotation is the main factor that influences the mass loss rate variations ( r.  rood , private communication , 2002 ) , with the exception of very high mass loss rates which may result from interactions with stellar binary companions . since main sequence stars in gcs are expected to rotate very slowly ( since they have experienced a long period of angular momentum losses due to magnetic activity ) ,",
    "if the rotation conjecture is correct , then very slow rotation is sufficient to influence mass loss on the rgb .",
    "our condition , therefore , may be somewhat conservative .",
    "the present angular momentum of the sun is @xmath92 g  @xmath93  s@xmath1 .",
    "a planet with a jupiter mass at 1  au from a solar type star has @xmath94 times the present angular momentum of the sun .",
    "taking as a typical value @xmath95 , our condition in equation  ( 11 ) reads @xmath96 . for a more general form @xmath97",
    ", our condition reads @xmath98 in addition , we limit the planet to @xmath99  au ( or @xmath100 ) , in order for tidal forces to be able to bring it into the rgb or agb star s envelope . these conditions are represented ( for @xmath101 ) as the two thick lines in fig .  1 .",
    "planets to the left of and above these lines affect the evolution of their parent stars significantly ( neglecting eccentric orbits of planets at larger orbital separations ) .",
    "not including the few systems above the line marked ` 2 ' in fig .  1",
    ", the total fraction of planetary systems that are likely to significantly influence the evolution of the central star at late stages is therefore , @xmath102 note that this integral is meanigful for @xmath103 .",
    "for @xmath104 the thick diagonal line in fig .",
    "1 crosses the upper limit as given by line ` 2 . '",
    "performing this integral for @xmath87 and @xmath88 , and substituting for @xmath61 from equation  ( 14 ) , we find @xmath105    equation  ( 17 ) shows that for our strong condition of @xmath106 , we find that more than 3.5% of all solar - type stars are significantly affected ( in terms of rotation rate and mass loss ) by planets or brown dwarf companions .",
    "this number increases to more than 9% for metal rich ( above solar ) stars . relaxing the condition to @xmath107 , i.e.  when the planet s orbital angular momentum equals the present one for the sun , increases the numbers to be @xmath108% and @xmath109% respectively .",
    "all of these numbers should probably be regarded as lower limits , since we have neglected the effects of planets at 2  au@xmath110  au in eccentric orbits ( which could also be pulled into the giant s envelope by tidal interaction ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and used only the minimum masses ( as well as not having included the planets above line ` 2 ' in fig .  1 ) .",
    "we have shown that the swallowing of planetary or brown dwarf companions can have significant effects in the late stages of the evolution of late - type stars . specifically , we considered rotation and mass loss .",
    "on the basis of the properties of the observed extrasolar planets , we estimated that @xmath11110% of the stars should experience enhanced mass loss due to the effects of planets .",
