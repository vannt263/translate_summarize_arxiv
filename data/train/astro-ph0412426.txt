    "to account for the origin and evolution of lithium , beryllium and boron , we rely on our understanding of several very different aspects of nucleosynthesis , namely : big bang , non thermal , stellar nucleosynthesis , all of which must be correlated through cosmic and chemical evolution .",
    "these rare light nuclei are not generated in the normal course of stellar nucleosynthesis ( except li  in the galactic disk ) and are in fact destroyed in stellar interiors .",
    "this explains the relatively low abundance of these species .",
    "while a significant fraction of the observed li  is produced in the big bang , the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) production of li , be and b results in abundances which are orders of magnitude below that observed in halo stars .",
    "for example , bbn production of li  is dominated by the process d@xmath0li . at the baryon density deduced from observations of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation by wmap @xcite ,",
    "its bbn value is li / h @xmath1 @xmath2 @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the bbn mean value of the li  abundance is , according to @xcite li / h = @xmath3 , according to @xcite li / h = @xmath4 , or according to @xcite li / h = @xmath5 . as such ,",
    "the li / li  ratio in bbn is about @xmath6 .",
    "the very low abundances of the li , @xmath7be and @xmath8b isotopes predicted by bbn theory imply that their most plausible production process was the interaction of galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) with the interstellar medium ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "of these isotopes , li  is of particular interest because it has only recently been measured in halo stars @xcite thus offering new constraints on the very early evolution of light elements @xcite .",
    "many studies have followed the evolution of li  in our galaxy ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of particular importance in this context is the @xmath9 reaction that leads to the synthesis of this isotope ( as well as li ) and is efficient very early in the evolutionary history of the galaxy .",
    "different scenarios have been discussed to explain the abundance of li  in metal - poor halo stars ( mphs ) .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility of cosmic rays produced in shocks during the formation of the galaxy , which was consistent with li  data available at that time .",
    "@xcite considers the decay of relic particles , during the epoch of the big bang nucleosynthesis , that can yield to a large primordial abundance of li . @xcite",
    "have studied in detail the lithium production in connection to gamma rays , using a formalism similar to ours but with a different point of view as far as the observational constraints are concerned ( see ) .    until recently",
    ", the abundance of li  had been observed in only a few mphs with metallicity [ fe / h ] larger than -2.3 .",
    "new values of the ratio li / li have been measured with uves at the vlt - ut2 kueyen eso telescope , in halo stars with metallicity ranging from -2.7 to -0.5 ( see ) .",
    "these observations indicate the presence of a plateau in li / h @xmath10 which suggests a pregalactic origin for the formation of li .    in this paper , we consider the synthesis of lithium due to the interaction of cosmological cosmic rays ( ccrs ) , produced at an early epoch , with the intergalactic medium ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as @xmath11 processes also produce 7 , these models are constrained by the 7 plateau observed in the same mphs .",
    "this constraint is made more severe by the current discrepancy between the bbn predicted value of 7 and the observational abundance .",
    "we demonstrate how this model can explain the recent observations and constrain the history of cosmological structure formation ( section  [ s : result ] ) and the galactic evolution of li   ( section  [ s : discussion ] ) .",
    "we compare these results with the expected evolution of 6 from gcr nucleosynthesis . without the pregalactic production of 6 ,",
    "the latter model can not account for the elevated 6 abundances at very low metallicity .",
    "in contrast , models for which o / fe increases at low metallicity are able to produce sufficient 6 at low metallicity , without pregalactic production .",
    "however , in this case , the bulk of the 6 data seen in higher metallicity stars must be argued to be depleted .",
    "the same is true for our model of ccr nucleosynthesis , but to a lesser extent .",
    "we argue that 6 data in stars with [ fe / h ] = -3 to -4 will be required to distinguish between these scenarios .",
    "our predictions will be compared to other work in and our conclusions are given in .",
    "the determination of the 6 abundance in mphs is extremely difficult and requires high resolution and high signal to noise spectra due to the tiny hyperfine splitting between the two lithium isotopes .",
    "the line splitting is only seen as the narrowly shifted lines are thermally broadened .",
    "though the fits to the width of this feature are sensitive to the 7/6 ratio , it is very difficult to obtain accurate measurements of the isotopic ratio .",
    "6 can only be realistically expected to be observed in stars with high surface temperatures and at low metallicities of [ fe / h ] @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite determined that only in stars with surface temperatures greater than about 6300 k will 6 survive in the observable surface layers of the star . at metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath13",
    ", even higher effective temperatures would be required to preserve 6 .",
    "as noted above , the previous sets of data on the lithium isotope ratio has been significantly expanded by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) with the observations of 24 mphs .",
    "previously , only 3 stars with metallicity [ fe / h ] @xmath14 showed net detections of 6 @xcite .",
    "the observed abundances of li / h and li / h are displayed versus the metallicity , [ fe / h ] , in .",
    "there are in addition several stars with metallicities in the range [ fe / h ] = -3 to -0.5 for which only upper limits ( not shown ) to the 6/7 ratio are available .",
    "note that the li  abundance at solar metallicity is plotted for both the meteoritic value @xcite and the solar photospheric value @xcite .",
    "the latter is derived from the photospheric value of li assuming the solar ratio 7/6 = 12 and therefore really represents an upper limit to the 6 photospheric abundance .    these new data at low metallicity",
    "reveal the existence of a plateau for li , whose abundance is about 1000 times higher than that predicted by bbn . as such ,",
    "another production mechanism which is capable of producing what appears to be an initial enrichment of 6 in the intergalactic medium is required . here , we concentrate on the interaction of @xmath15 particles present in ccrs produced at high redshift , with he at rest in the igm , as a potential description of this pregalactic enrichment process",
    ". the abundances in higher metallicity stars will be discussed in .",
    "note that there is , however , considerable dispersion in the data , and as noted above , there are many stars for which there was no detectable 6 , indicating that depletion may have played a role in the observed 6 abundance for stars in the plateau as well .",
    "this is in contrast to the 7 plateau which shows very little dispersion and for which we expect the role of depletion to have been minor @xcite .",
    "galactic production of lithium arises from the interaction of gcrs with the ism via the @xmath11 reaction .",
    "this is a primary process which yields a logarithmic slope of 1 in the lithium abundance versus metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) relation as seen in .",
    "the amplitude for 6 production is constrained by the abundances of be and b ( see for an additional discussion ) .",
    "as one can see , this model can not explain the elevated 6 abundances at low metallicity and requires some 6 depletion at higher metallicity ( as will all of the models discussed here ) .",
    "recently , @xcite have performed new measurements related to the @xmath9 reaction and provide a new fit for the production of liand li .",
    "the calculated li  abundances from the gcr process using the often applied @xcite cross sections and the fit at higher energy provided by @xcite resulting in slightly less ( 30  50 % at solar metallicity ) 6 are compared in . in what follows",

    "in addition , the rate of production of 6 decreases rapidly soon after the initial burst .",
    "this was noted in m77 and corresponds to the dilution of the ccr flux with the expansion of the universe .",

    "the ccr normalization also depends on the shape of the energy spectrum , @xmath93 . a steeper spectrum ( higher @xmath93 ) favors the low energy part of the spectrum , where the lithium production peaks .",

    "it is interesting to note that ccrs were predicted to heat the igm and thus avoid the problem of overcooling in the igm gas @xcite .",

    "note that this is much larger than the resulting igm metallicity where 6 production occurs . at @xmath119 and at a metallicity of 0.01 solar , their limit is effectively relaxed to @xmath120 erg/@xmath121 .",
    "thus , we see that the ccr production of 6 is capable of explaining the large abundance of 6 with negligible production of 7 ( both relative to the bbn value ) .",
    "sufficient 6 production is achieved by adjusting the flux of ccrs and depends primarily on the assumed redshift of the initial burst , @xmath22 .",
    "subsequently , the 6 abundance remains roughly constant until additional 6 is produced in the galaxy through cgrs as we discuss in the next section .",
    "the above model for the ccr production can be thought of as a form of prompt initial enrichment if our galaxy is formed hierarchically from previously evolved structures .",
    "ccrs produce 6 and a small amount ( about a few % of the bbn value ) of 7 . subsequently , the abundances of these element isotopes as well as all other element abundances are controlled by galactic chemical evolution . at this point , we assume only that the initial abundances in the gas in the galaxy correspond to those in the igm at @xmath122 .",
    "it is certain that 6 will be produced in the ism through gcr nucleosynthesis ( described briefly below ) as this is the primary mechanism for the production of 9 and 10 .",
    "these isotopes will not have been produced in any significant quantities as the igm was initially devoid of c , n , and o needed for spallation processes . in contrast , the presence of primordial 4 allows for the ccr production of li .    cosmic rays produced in the early galaxy will invariably interact with the existing ism . in standard gcr nucleosynthesis",
    "@xcite libeb nuclei are produced by spallation when protons and @xmath15s in the cosmic rays impinge on ism c , n , or o. libeb is also produced when cno in the cosmic rays are spalled by ism protons and @xmath15s .",
    "as such , spallation requires heavy elements ( ` metals ' ) to be present in either the cosmic rays or the ism .",
    "in addition , @xmath11 fusion reactions between cosmic rays and the ism lead to the production of the lithium isotopes .",
    "indeed , these were precisely the types of process considered above in our model of ccr nucleosynthesis .",
    "note that 7 and 11 also receive contributions from the @xmath123 @xcite , but these will not be important for our present discussion .",
    "as in the case of ccr nucleosynthesis , @xmath15 fusion in gcr nucleosynthesis is a primary process in contrast to the production of be and b in standard models .",
    "the spallation of ism cno is a secondary process so these abundances scale as the square of a metallicity tracer such as o or fe if [ o / fe ] is constant at low values of [ fe / h ] .",
    "motivated by the observational fact that the log of the be and b abundances appear to scale linearly with [ fe / h ] it has been proposed that the bulk of cosmic rays are not accelerated in the general ism , but rather in the metal - rich interiors of superbubbles @xcite , specifically at low metallicity . because the superbubble composition is enriched in metals , any cosmic rays which are accelerated in superbubble interiors would have a composition which is both metal - rich and time - independent .",
    "the low - energy component of the hard energy spectra associated with superbubbles results in the primary production of be and b. we refer to this process as lec .",
    "in general both the lec and standard gcr nucleosynthesis are responsible for the observed libeb abundances .    in fig",
    "[ f : obs ] , we display the gcr production of 6 in the absence of the prompt initial enrichment produced by ccr nucleosynthesis . here , we have normalized the flux of galactic cosmic rays so as to correctly reproduce the solar value of be / h . the overall flux is the only parameter available in gcr nucleosynthesis , and as a consequence the abundances of 10 and 6 are predictions of the model ( recall that the 11 and 7 receive an additional contribution from the @xmath124-process ) . as expected",
    "the logarithmic slope of [ li ] versus [ fe / h ] is 1 @xcite .    in",
    "we show the evolution of li  vs [ fe / h ] when both ccr and lec processes are included . as one can see in figure 3 , without the initial enrichment of 6 due to ccrs , the evolution of 6 resembles that of standard gcrs . in this case , the 6 abundance begins at very low values and rises with a slope of unity until late times .",
    "this model alone can not explain the observational data . at low [ fe / h ] ( @xmath125 ) , the observed 6 abundance is too high to be accounted for by standard cgr + lec nucleosynthesis .",
    "in addition , to explain the data at higher [ fe / h ] ( @xmath126 ) , one must argue that depletion has lowered the abundance of 6 .",
    "this is perhaps reasonable as the depth of the convection zone is increased at higher metallicity for a fixed surface temperature .",
    "we note that many of the stars observed only reveal upper limits to the 6 abundance .",
    "that is , in roughly 15 examples of stars with similar temperatures and metallicities as those shown , no 6 was detected .",
    "the lack of 6 in some stars , coupled with the dispersion seen in the data may also indicate that some depletion of 6 has occurred in some of these stars .",
    "indeed , the difference between the solar photospheric and meteoritic values corresponds to a destruction of li  of at least a factor of about 200 . in this model",
    ", we would argue that the destruction of li  is negligible at [ fe / h ] @xmath125 where the calculation from galactic processes cross the plateau .",
    "( 12,9 )    we also show in the evolution of 6 when the prompt enrichment due to ccrs is included . in this case , the data at low [ fe / h ] is nicely modeled but depletion is still required to explain the data at higher metallicity . at present , the evidence for the plateau hinges on the abundances in only a few stars at low metallicity .",
    "however the two models shown in can be distinguished by future observations of 6 at metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath127 which would establish the role of ccr nucleosynthesis as a mechanism for the early production of 6 . as mentionned above , a prompt initial enrichment ( pie ) in heavy elements is also expected in the intergalactic medium , especially within this pop iii stars scenario .",
    "however , the initial mass fraction of iron may be of the order of x(fe ) = @xmath128 @xcite and thus do not modify the curves in and , for [ fe / h]@xmath129 .",
    "thus , models with a 6 plateau are not affected by the iron pie generated by pop iii stars .",
    "the gcr nucleosynthesis models described above were based on the assumption that [ o / fe ] was constant at low [ fe / h ] .",
    "that is , we can use the iron abundance to trace the evolution of the libeb elements .",
    "however some data show that [ o / fe ] increases with decreasing [ fe / h ] @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the evolution of be and b may appear to be primary with respect to [ fe / h ] , but in fact is secondary with respect to [ o / h ] @xcite .",
    "in reality , the data show that with the respect to [ o / h ] , beb have admixtures of primary and secondary components .",
    "that is , the slope for log(beb / h ) vs. [ o / h ] is between 1 and 2 @xcite .",
    "in , we show the resulting evolution of 6 when the slope of [ o / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] is taken to be -0.45 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a slope larger than -0.45 , a prompt initial enrichment is not required since the galactic production of 6 would already exceed the abundance observed in all stars . however , within such a model , the destruction rate of li  must be non - negligible for metallicities as low as [ fe / h]@xmath1 -3 . in and",
    ", the slope was chosen to be 0 corresponding to constant [ o / fe ] .",
    "( 12,9 )    before concluding this part of the discussion , we note that the dispersion in the data may be due to irregular production rather than depletion . due to the dilution of the ccr flux , the production of lithium saturates soon after the initial burst ( ) at @xmath130 .",
    "however , if this burst does not occur at a redshift much larger than @xmath131 , the abundance of lithium can still increase .",
    "shows the expected variation of the li  and li  abundances from @xmath132 to 3 .",
    "if the igm can pollute the galaxy ( e.g. through the merging of satellites , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath133 , the abundance pattern in stars that form later may reflect this dispersion . for our choice of @xmath134 , the late production of li may constrain the redshift of the ccr burst to be greater than about 5 - 6 .",
    "( 12,9 )      @xcite consider a model where cosmic rays generated by structure formation , during the process of galaxy formation , produce li   in the course of the evolution of the galaxy .",
    "in their model , much of the 6 is produced early and therefore they also predict a 6 plateau which extends down to at most [ fe / h ] @xmath135 .",
    "the characteristics of the plateau depend on the history of structure formation .",
    "if this process occurs early enough in the formation of the galaxy , model i of @xcite is consistent with the new observations ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) . once again",
    ", observations of 6 at metallicities between -3 and -4 can distinguish between this model and the one we have presented here for which the plateau is predicted to extend to much lower metallicities .",
    "furthermore , within the model of @xcite , the exact evolution of the li  abundance can be linked to the mean azimuthal rotation velocity of mphss .",
    "consequently , they predict larger dispersion among the observed li  abundances , together with a correlation between the liabundance and the rotation velocity .",
    "this could also help distinguish between galactic @xmath9 gcr production from the early @xmath9 ccr production considered in this paper .",
    "the work by @xcite uses a similar formalism to that described above , though redshift evolution is not formally taken into account .",
    "however , their main focus is on the lithium - gamma ray connection in relation to the solar li  abundance . under this assumption",
    ", they claim that , if ccr interactions account for all of the liproduction , it will also account for all of the observed extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egrb ) . in this paper",
    ", we claim that ccrs must produce a pregalactic li  abundance , that is about 10 times smaller than the solar abundance since most of the li  in stars at solar metallicity is produced during galactic evolution ( ) . hence , we would argue that it should produce only 10% of the total egrb ( from their eq .",
    "13 ) , which is consistent with theoretical predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite argue that the observation of li in high - velocity clouds may help establish the necessity of an early source of li .",
    "finally , we note that @xcite considers the very early production of li  during bbn from decay @xcite or annihilation @xcite of relic particles .",
    "naturally , this model will also predict the existence of an elevated plateau .",
    "the existence of the spite plateau for liindicates that low metallicity halo stars are representative of the primordial bbn abundance , although the discrepancy with predictions based on wmap results is still an issue @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the hint for a plateau in li   at very low metallicity , and at a higher abundance than predicted in standard bbn ( by a factor of 1000 ) , requires an additional process that produces li   in a pregalactic phase .",
    "the process studied in this paper involves the interaction of @xmath15 particles present in early cosmological cosmic rays with primordial helium present in the intergalactic medium .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to produce sufficient quantities of li , without the additionnal over - production of li",
    ".    the early production of li   will be present in the gas that forms the galaxy at @xmath83 and provides a simple explanation for the existence of the observed li  plateau in mphs .",
    "the level of the li  plateau may provide a strong constraint on the -  plane for the initial burst of ccrs , and hence on its total energy .",
    "however , the existence of this plateau needs to be confirmed with additional observations of li   in stars with metallicities lower than -3 .",
    "if the 6 plateau persists down to lower metallicities , it could confirm the predictions of this model and distinguish the physical processes occurring during galaxy formation .    in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will go further than the single burst approximation .",
    "the ccr production could be related to the formation and chemical evolution of pop iii stars @xcite .",
    "the influence of this process in the production of other elements , such as be , b and d , will also be studied .",
