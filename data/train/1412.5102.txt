    "quantum entanglement has been one of the key ideas in the revolution that the contemporary world has witnessed with the emergence of the concept of quantum computation and information .",
    "it has been used to formulate certain interesting , though often counterintuitive , applications such as teleportation and super - dense coding [ 1][2][3 ] .",
    "decoherence and ways to lessen the effect of decoherence on quantum states has been the subject of work [ 4][5][6 ] .",
    "lately work has been done on experimental realization of such ideas , such as the realization of decoherence free subspaces using nickel impurities in diamond [ 7 ] .",
    "entanglement has been a key concept in quantum communication protocols .",
    "quantum repeaters and entanglement purification has been the subject of interest lately , as well [ 8][9][10 ] .",
    "+   + for information transfer using entanglement between parties , one needs an established entangled channel - state and means of classical communication .",
    "teleportation of an arbitrary single qubit state using a channel comprising of an epr pair was first demonstrated by bennett et al [ 11 ] . lately , w - ghz composite states have been used for teleportation as well as superdense coding of arbitrary quantum states . in this paper , we have shown that the seven - qubit xwz state can be used for teleportation of arbitrary single , double and triple qubit states .",
