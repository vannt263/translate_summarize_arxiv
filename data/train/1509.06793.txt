    "since the discovery of the light exotic hypernuclei in the early sixties [ 1 - 2 ] , peoples are giving much attention to study the structure of such multistrange hypernuclei [ 3 - 4 ] .",
    "some of the experimentally observed one- and two-@xmath0 hypernuclei are @xmath4he , @xmath5he , @xmath6be , @xmath7be , @xmath8c and @xmath9b [ 5 - 11 ] .",
    "information about the @xmath2 and @xmath3 forces can be extracted from the bound state properties of such nuclei .",
    "these informations on @xmath2 and @xmath3 interaction together with the well known @xmath10 interaction may give better understanding of the strong quark - quark ( qq ) interaction , since the hyperons also have qqq structure as that of nucleons .",
    "as for example proton has three quarks namely up , up , down ( @xmath11 ) , neutron has quarks up , down , down ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 has quarks up , down , strange ( @xmath14 ) etc . in the earlier stage of their discovery , emulsion experiments provided some information on the binding energies of @xmath0-particle in the light exotic hypernuclei and their decay rates ( life times@xmath15 ) [ 2 ] . from",
    "the available binding energy data physicists gathered some qualitative informations about the @xmath0-nucleon ( @xmath3 ) interaction and single particle potential strength for the @xmath0-particle in hypernuclei [ 12 ] .",
    "the hyperon - nucleon scattering experiments have also been performed but these are not so profound and are still in the primary stages and do not give detailed phase shifts to construct the potential reliably .",
    "some @xmath3 and @xmath16 total cross - sections and very few angular distribution at low energies have been measured [ 13 - 18 ] , but these are not sufficient to allow the phase shift analysis . under the circumstances , the bound state properties of single- and double- @xmath0 hypernuclei can only give useful indirect information about @xmath3 and @xmath2 interactions .",
    "for example , one can take phenomenological forms of @xmath3 and @xmath2 interactions and see if they reproduce the experimentally observed observables of the hypernuclei .",
    "alternatively one can adjust the parameters of the empirical potential to reproduce the bound state properties and thus predict the effective @xmath3 and @xmath2 interactions .",
    "in some earlier works [ 19 - 22 ] physicists have used variational and approximate few body methods for the hypernuclei treating them a few body system . in the present work",
    ", we investigate the structure and properties of the ground and excited states of double-@xmath0 hypernuclei with mass number @xmath17 and ground state of their binary subsystems consisting the core and one outer core @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "a simple two - body model has been adopted here for the single-@xmath0 hypernucleus ( @xmath18 ) consisting of a @xmath19 core and one valence @xmath0 particle . and for the double-@xmath0 hypernuclei ( @xmath20 )",

    "a phenomenological form has been chosen .",
    "the core-@xmath0 potential has been obtained by folding an effective @xmath3 potential by the density of the core nucleus .",
    "the strength of the effective @xmath3 potential for a given core is adjusted to reproduce the experimentally known be of the single @xmath0 hypernuclei @xmath4he , @xmath22he [ 6 ] , @xmath22be [ 23 ] , @xmath23s [ 24 ] , @xmath24ca [ 24 ] and @xmath25zr [ 25 ] .",
    "the same folded core-@xmath0 potential is then used for the double-@xmath0 hypernucleus for the same core .",

    "this method is a powerful tool for the @xmath26 solution of the few body schrdinger equation for a given set of binary interaction potentials among the constituent particles .",
    "this method has been used for bound states in atomic [ 26 - 33 ] , nuclear [ 34 - 40 ] and particle physics [ 41 - 43 ] .",
    "attempts have been made to use it in scattering problems as well [ 44 ] . in this method",
    ", the wave function is expanded in a complete set of hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) , which are , for a three - body system , the six - dimensional analogue of ordinary spherical harmonics .",
    "the schrdinger equation reduces to a set of coupled differential equations which can be solved numerically .",
    "the hhe method is essentially exact and involves no approximation other than an eventual truncation of the expansion basis .",
    "any desired precision in the binding energy can , in principle , be achieved by gradually expanding the expansion basis and checking the rate of convergence . however",
    "the number of coupled differential equations and hence , the complexity in the numerical solution increases rapidly as the expansion basis is increased by introducing larger hyper angular momentum quantum numbers .",
    "computer limitations set an ultimate limit to the precision attainable .",

    "the excited state wave function is more spread out than the ground state and therefore needs larger @xmath32 for the same degree of convergence .",
    "we circumvent this difficulty by invoking supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( ssqm ) [ 45 ] .",
    "in ssqm , we construct the supersymmetric partner potential ( @xmath33 ) of the original potential ( @xmath34 ) [ 1 ] . according to ssqm ,",
    "the spectra of @xmath34 and @xmath33 are identical except for the absence of the ground state of @xmath34 in the spectrum of @xmath33 [ 45 ] .",
    "hence the ground state of @xmath33 corresponds to the first excited state of @xmath34 .",

    "in the present calculation we have taken the core to be structureless . since the core ( @xmath40he , @xmath41be , @xmath128he , @xmath42s , @xmath43ca , @xmath44zr ) contains only nucleons and no @xmath0-particles , there is no symmetry requirements under exchange of the valence @xmath0 particles with the core nucleons .",

    "the possible total spin ( s ) of the three - body system @xmath132 can take two values 0 or 1 since the spin of the core in all the above cases has a value 0 .",
    "thus the total orbital angular momentum l can be either 0 or 1 corresponding to s=0 or 1 respectively .",
    "hence the set of quantum numbers ( ls)j for the ground state of all even - even core double-@xmath0 hypernuclei is ( 00)0 and ( 11)0 which corresponds to @xmath133 and @xmath134 states .",
    "since the ground state of these nuclei have definite parity , odd and even parity states will not mix . in our case ,",

    "the even values of @xmath129 correspond to l=0 , s=0 and odd values of @xmath129 correspond to l=1 , s=1 .",

    "this phenomenon may be viewed as the effect of screening of the interacting nucleon embedded in the core , by the surrounding nucleons . and",
    "this effect of screening increases as the number of neighboring nucleons increases .",
    "one may expect such a result from physical intuition . following the above empirical formula one can estimate the depth of the effective @xmath3 potential for the single-@xmath0 hypernuclei in any mass range .",
    "the single @xmath0 separation energy @xmath166 is found to increase with the increase in core mass approximately following the equation @xmath208 with @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "similarly , the trend of variation of the two-@xmath0 separation is found to follow the equation @xmath211 with @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "( 42 ) and ( 43 ) may respectively be useful in determining @xmath166 and @xmath27 for any one- and two @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "also the approximate size of any double @xmath0 hypernuclei of mass number ( a ) can be estimated by our empirical formula @xmath214 with @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "it can be seen from energy level diagram ( see fig .",
    "9 ) that the energy levels for the exotic isobars @xmath217he and @xmath217be are almost identical . however",
    "the slight difference in their one- and two-@xmath0 separation energies ( see column 4 of table ii and iii ) is due to the relatively stronger coulomb repulsion in the core of the latter .",
    "the calculated values of the partial probability ( see table v ) shows that larger contribution to the ground state total wave function comes from the @xmath148 partial wave and the rest cones from the higher even @xmath129 components . the contribution from the odd",
    "@xmath129 values are zero . from the calculated values of the single- and double- @xmath0 separation energies ( see table ii & iii ) and the rms matter radii ( see table iv ) it may be concluded that the addition of one- or two-@xmath0 particle to the core makes the system strongly bound and more compact .",
    "this is quite true as the weakly bound @xmath218 or unbound @xmath219 core becomes strongly bound on addition of one or two @xmath0 hyeperon(s ) .",
    "hence , it is quite possible that our predictions for the binding energies of the ground and excited states of experimentally unobserved double @xmath0 hypernuclei are valid .",
    "thus we may say that that the @xmath3 force is much stronger and much attractive than the @xmath10 force .",
    "perhaps this may be due to the presence of the strange quark in the @xmath0 hyperon quark constituents .",
