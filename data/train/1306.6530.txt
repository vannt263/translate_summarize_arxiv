    "scalar field theory is an essential tool to master the main techniques in quantum field theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it appeared just like a mathematical object until quite recently at lhc the higgs particle was observed displaying all the expected properties for a scalar field interacting with other matter in the standard model @xcite .",
    "higgs field , as proposed in the sixties  @xcite , is characterized by a mass term with a `` wrong '' sign and a weak quartic term providing self - interaction .",
    "the original formulation of the standard model postulates that conformal invariance must hold for all other matter @xcite that is , all particles entering into the model are massless and only breaking the symmetry su(2)@xmath0u(1 ) through the higgs mechanism yields the mass terms .",
    "higgs mechanism considers a potential term the same as the one in the landau theory of phase transitions .",
    "this forces the choice of a odd mass term .",
    "the introduction of such term is the reason of the so - called `` hierarchy '' problem as the next - to - leading order correction to the mass of the higgs field goes like the square of a cut - off running it to a planck mass where the model is expected to fail .",
    "just a proper fine tuning or some other mechanism yet to be discovered can explain the observed mass of this particle .    in order to evade this problem",
    ", bardeen @xcite proposed that the standard model should preserve conformal invariance at the classical level .",
    "this would imply that the breaking of the symmetry should be dynamical generated , possibly through radiative corrections through the coleman - weinberg @xcite mechanism . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "nicolai and meissner pointed out that , due to the smallness of the mass of the higgs particle obtained using the coleman - weinberg mechanism , another higgs particle must be introduced reconciling in this way bardeen s approach with observational data .",
    "but the success of the coleman - weinberg mechanism , being perturbative in origin , implies that , in order to obtain the right mass , one can not stop to the first few terms of a perturbation series .",
    "this has been recently proved by chishtie , hanif , jia , mann , mckeon , sherry and steele @xcite and steele and wang @xcite that , extending to higher orders the computation of the effective potential , the right mass for the higgs particle is recovered giving a boost to the idea of conformal invariance for the standard model .",
    "this moves the test of this idea from the existence of a further higgs particle to the experimental determination of the self - coupling of the higgs field .",
    "this is something to be seen at the restart of the lhc on 2015 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show how a consistent quantum field field theory can be built assuming the self - coupling of the field large and the field itself is massless .",
    "this is obtained by using a set of exact classical solutions that were recently obtained @xcite .",
    "these solutions display massive nonlinear waves notwithstanding the theory is massless .",
    "an immediate consequences of this is that there exists an infinite set of quantum field theories having a trivial infrared fixed point and that have a non - null vacuum expectation value mimicking the behavior of the higgs field as currently appears in the standard model .",
    "one of the immediate consequences is that higher excited states exist for the particle and that production rates for decay to ww and zz are different from those expected in the standard model , paving the way to check conformal invariance earlier from the already collected data at lhc .",
    "similarly , we completely define the perturbative solutions in a strong self - coupled scalar theory both classically and for quantum field theory .",
    "we just note that the criticism put forward in @xcite is here overcome as we can have classical conformal invariance , keep it at a quantum level with dimensional regularization and maintain a physical value for the mass of the higgs particle as we will see .",
    "this makes this scenario an even stronger competitor for a conformal extension of the standard model .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] we introduce the classical theory and we solve it completely with a finite but not so small coupling .",
    "the green function is also obtained that will be fundamental for the quantum analysis.in sec .",
    "[ sec : cesce ] , we prove that our current expansion is really a strong coupling expansion obtaining a power series in the inverse powers of the coupling . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we provide the current expansion and relative n - point functions that can be defined in this way for the classical solution . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we give a quantum treatment .",
    "firstly , we solve numerically the dyson - schwinger equation for the scalar field to prove consistency for our approach .",
    "then , in the limit of strong coupling , we compute the next - to - leading order term both for the classical solution and the green function .",
    "it is obtained an expansion in inverse powers of the coupling . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we present the callan - symanzik equation and the beta function for the theory to the next - to - leading order .",
    "the field renormalization constant is computed . in sec .",
    "[ sec4a ] we show how renormalization can be systematically done also for this formulation of the perturbation series in quantum field theory . in sec.[sec4b ] we discuss in depth the question of how this scalar field theory breaks conformal invariance and the relevance of the existence of a zero mode . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we comment about application of these results to the standard model and the production rates with respect to the standard model are given . finally , in sec .  [ sec6 ] we yield the conclusions .",
    "we consider a classical scalar field @xmath1 satisfying the equation @xmath2 being @xmath3 the ( dimensionless ) strength of the self - interaction and @xmath4 an external source . our aim is to get an expansion in terms of the inverse of some positive power of @xmath5 . in order to get the right perturbation series",
    ", we rescale the space - time vector as @xmath6 . in the same way",
    ", we explicit the dependence on @xmath5 of the source as @xmath7 .",
    "the interesting point to note here is that this choice , that is somewhat arbitrary , fixes the expansion parameter of the perturbation series . with this choice on the current ,",
    "we take @xmath8 then , it is not difficult to see that the following set of equations holds @xmath9 from this set of equations , we recognize that we have essentially a couple of equations to solve before to solve completely the theory in the limit we are interested in .",
    "we have to find the exact solution to the following system of equations : @xmath10 @xmath11 is a fundamental solution .",
    "this approach is quite general provided we are able to get @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , a set of exact solutions exist for these two equations .",
    "the solution for the first one is @xcite @xmath12 provided that @xmath13 being @xmath14 and @xmath15 two integration constants and sn a jacobi elliptic function .",
    "this represents a kind of massive solution even if we started from a massless field theory when @xmath16 is interpreted like the momenta of the wave .",
    "this class of solutions has the property , similarly to the case of the plane waves of the free theory , to have finite energy density @xcite .",
    "this reduces the second equation to @xmath17 we immediately notice that the green function is not translation invariant .",
    "this equation is linear and we use a gradient expansion to solve it .",
    "we must remember that we are working with distributions and their derivatives . in the following sections we will show that : _ green function is indeed translational invariant _ and that the _ strong coupling expansion is equivalent to an expansion in the powers of current_.      let us rewrite eq.([eq : green ] ) as @xmath18 where we have introduced an arbitrary order parameter @xmath19 that we set to 1 at the end of computation .",
    "so , taking @xmath20 , we get the set of equations @xmath21 by noting that @xmath22 , the leading order reduces to solve the equation , that corresponds to the original equation but in the rest frame , @xmath23 being @xmath24 .",
    "we can yield an exact solution in the form @xmath25 being @xmath26 the heaviside step function and provided we fix the phases to @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "but an exact solution can be also provided for @xmath30 @xcite as we will show in [ sec : appa ] . in this way",
    "we have identified an infinite set of solutions to the classical scalar field theory and for these solutions the corresponding quantum theory is trivial @xcite at the leading order .",
    "we are able to solve exactly eq .",
    "( [ eq : green ] ) .",
    "indeed , we have the formal series @xmath31 that can be easily resummed using a fourier transform and with the fact that @xmath32 .",
    "firstly , we note that @xmath33 and so @xmath34 but one has @xmath35 and this gives @xmath36 in the following we choose the simplest realization for @xmath37 and so , @xmath38 we note that our solution must be invariant under time reversal @xmath39 as also the time reversed solution must be kept into account .",
    "this means that our solution is @xmath40.\\ ] ] this will provide us the fourier transformed result @xmath41 where we put @xmath42 and @xmath43 . turning to our solution series eq .",
    "( [ eq : series ] ) we recognize that higher order terms are just the geometric series that adds a @xmath44 to the denominator granting for lorentz invariance .",
    "so , the final result is @xmath45 in this way we were able to recover the translation invariance of the theory we started from .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath46 and the theory recovers the free limit for @xmath47 and so @xmath48 .",

    "( [ eq : delta ] ) we approximate @xmath109 and so @xmath110 where we have put @xmath111 and so @xmath112 being @xmath113 .",
    "this means that we have @xmath114 that , remembering that @xmath115 , can be seen as a renormalization of the coupling giving @xmath116 this identifies also the renormalization constant for the field being defined through @xmath117 and so @xmath118",
    "in the preceding section we have shown how to perform computations in quantum field theory when the scalar field theory is strongly coupled . in order to give soundness to such a computation we need to show how the theory can be managed in this limit in a systematic way .",
    "we do this by reducing our generating functional to that of a standard renormalizable theory .",
    "so , we undo all our scaling and rewrite the generating functional of the theory as @xmath119={\\cal n}e^{i\\int d^4xj\\phi_0 }    e^{-i\\int d^4x\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}\\phi_0(x)\\frac{\\delta^3}{i\\delta j(x)^3}+\\frac{1}{4\\lambda}\\frac{\\delta^4}{\\delta j(x)^4}\\right ) }    e^{\\frac{i}{2}\\int d^4xd^4yj(x)g_0(x - y)j(y)}\\ ] ] where now is @xmath120 and @xmath121 . for the following ,",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath122 and so , it is just a sum of exponentials that contribute to the conservation of momenta in a vertex .",
    "now , we show that this theory is renormalizable exactly in the same way as it is done in the weak perturbation case .",
    "so , let us consider the scalar theory @xmath123 this theory is known to be renormalizable in @xmath124 having @xmath125 dimension 1 and being @xmath126 dimensionless ( e.g. see @xcite ) and all the cut - off dependencies can be reabsorbed into @xmath125 , @xmath126 and the field .",
    "the cubic term is super - renormalizable in @xmath124 and it is not relevant in the ultraviolet . writing down the generating functional , this takes the form @xmath127={\\cal n }    e^{-i\\int d^4x\\left(g_1\\frac{\\delta^3}{i\\delta j(x)^3}+\\frac{g_2}{4}\\frac{\\delta^4}{\\delta j(x)^4}\\right ) }    e^{\\frac{i}{2}\\int d^4xd^4yj(x)\\hat g_0(x - y)j(y)}\\ ] ] being @xmath128 a solution to the equation @xmath129 .",
    "feynman diagrams can be immediately written down from the generating functional ( [ eq : sc34 ] ) .",
    "we see that this functional can be exactly mapped onto the one of the strongly coupled expansion ( [ eq : zsc ] ) provided we properly account for the field @xmath130 but this just contributes adding momentum to the vertex . besides , the propagator of the strongly coupled theory is , in agreement with kllen - lehman representation , that of a free theory ( a sum of free massive propagators ) as the theory has a trivial infrared fixed point .",
    "so , we can conclude that the renormalization program applies as well to the strongly coupled perturbation theory with all the cut - off dependencies eventually reabsorbed into the coupling @xmath5 and the field .",
    "this conclusion is important as this means that we are able to get a renormalized perturbation theory both for the coupling that goes formally to zero and to infinity .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the classical solution gets quantum corrections as it should .",
    "the choice of the cut - off is based on the conclusions we draw from the renormalization group analysis we performed in the preceding section .",
    "this theory has a non - perturbative beta function providing a running coupling going to zero at both the extrema of the momentum range .",
    "this means that there must exist a maximum at some value of the momentum range and the existence of this upper bound for the coupling permits us to fix a proper momentum scale for the theory . in this way , we chose the same cut - off emerging from classical solutions down to all the range , being this arbitrary .",
    "we are in a position to understand the kind of breaking of symmetry that occurs with these classical solutions . in this section",
    "we will follow the approach presented by nicolai and meissner in @xcite that set the framework to understand how conformal invariance is preserved granting a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "we will show that our approach is perfectly consistent with that presented by those authors . as shown in @xcite , the behavior of a theory under conformal symmetry",
    "can be understood when use is made of a energy - momentum tensor that respects such a symmetry .",
    "this was yielded in @xcite ( see also a more recent discussion in @xcite ) and for our case takes the form @xmath131 the conditions for preserving conformal invariance is given by @xmath132 , i.e. the trace of the tensor is zero .",
    "we expect that this condition is violated by renormalization in quantum field theory .",
    "we have already shown ( preceding section ) that renormalization in our case is performed exactly in the same way is done for a weak coupling case . as proved in @xcite , one loop correction is local and goes like @xmath133 eventually correcting the anomalous ward identity that is expected to be @xmath134 with @xmath135 a fourth order operator .",
    "we are able to prove that the same argument applies to our case as well .    for the classical solution given in ( [ eq : exact ] )",
    ", we note that the traceless condition holds on shell @xcite and , being this solution an exact one , this condition holds straightforwardly . from this",
    "we can conclude that the symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the massive excitation we get . in a moment",
    "we will show that a mode zero exists in this case that works as a goldstone mode ( this was already pointed out in @xcite ) .",
    "firstly , we would like to point out that , for the quantum corrections , the same argument given in @xcite applies also to our case . for our aims",
    ", we write here the result in @xcite for the effective potential in the coleman - weinberg approach ^(1 ) [ ] & = & 2 d^4x d(x , x ; ) ^2(x ) + [ gaform ] + & & + 4d^4x d^4y d(x , y ; ) ^2(y ) d(y , x ; ) ^2(x ) +  provided that ( ^2 + 3 ^ 2(x ) ) d(x , y ; ) = ^(4)(x , y ) .",
    "[ propag ] but we know how to solve this equation and so , the exact form of the propagator for the classical solution ( [ eq : exact ] ) making this identical to the case of a constant field discussed in @xcite when the expansion is taken around @xmath136 . in order to complete the calculation",
    ", we have to take into account that we will have ( written for the euclidean case as customary ) d(x , y ; ) |_(x)=_0(x ) = e^-p(x - y)_n=0^ with @xmath137 and @xmath99 given in sec .",
    "[ subsec : green ] .",
    "so , dimensional regularization can be applied as well and the structure of the integrals is identical being that of sums of free massive propagators . from this result we can conclude that the problem of the quadratic divergence is similar to that discussed in the weak coupling limit .",
    "finally , let us discuss the question of the goldstone mode arising from the spontaneous breaking of the conformal symmetry .",
    "we have already discussed this question in @xcite .",
    "we give this here for reader s convenience .",
    "our key operator is @xmath138 .",
    "we have shown in sec.[sec3 ] that this operator quantifies the fluctuations with respect to the vacuum solution . a zero mode for this operator can give rise to a spontaneous breaking of symmetry .",
    "this is seen both in quantum field theory and statistical mechanics as well @xcite . for our aims",
    "it is enough to show that the kernel of the @xmath139 operator is not trivial .",
    "indeed , the eigenvalue problem takes the form @xmath140\\chi_n(x)=\\lambda_n\\chi_n(x).\\ ] ] it is really easy to see that the case with @xmath141 admits a non - trivial solution @xcite and so , a zero mode exists .",
    "this implies that @xmath142 is infinite .",
    "this analysis of a scalar field theory appears well suited to application to the standard model in the conformal limit .",
    "indeed , it appears not distinguishable from a higgs field but decay rates are modified .",
    "this can be immediately realized if we look at the propagator of the theory that can be easily interpreted through kllen - lehman representation as the sum of an infinite number of states each one having mass @xmath99 and a probability of production @xmath143 .",
    "this factor , being lesser than 1 , can depress decay rates of processes like @xmath144 @xcite that are currently observed at lhc .",
    "we just point out that the number of events obtained so far by atlas and cms is too small yet to rule out this model .",
    "we give here a table of these probabilities for each excited state to give a correct view of what one should expect @xcite .",
    ".[tab : fn ] weights and percentage reductions of the decay rates of higgs excited states .",
    "percentages are respect to the ground state in the second column and respect to the standard model ( sm ) in the third one . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is also important to note that higher massive states , if ever exist , are increasingly difficult to observe due to the even more depressed production rates with respect to the ground state , that should be the currently observed higgs particle at lhc , as can be evinced from tab .",
    "[ tab : fn ] .",
    "it is interesting to digress on the ground state , that is the currently seen higgs particle , that has a decay factor of @xmath145 .",
    "this means that , with respect to the expectations of the standard model , the production rates for the decays @xmath146 and @xmath147 are reduced .",
    "indeed , cms data reach almost exactly this value for the ww decay but errors are sizable yet .",
    "rates are @xmath148 for zz and @xmath149 for ww . these figures are in really close agreement with those we computed in tab.[tab : fn ] but , as said , error bars are too much large to make a claim . for atlas ,",
    "results are better aligned with the standard model but a similar argument on the size of errors holds and in order to get a definite answer we will have to wait the restart of the lhc .",
    "we have shown how a massless scalar field theory with a quartic self - interaction can be properly managed in the strong coupling limit .",
    "the theory yields massive excitations notwithstanding no mass term is present .",
    "this would permit to build up a fully conformal standard model , at a classical level , and agrees with recent results using coleman - weinberg mechanism @xcite .",
    "we would expect that , if one is able to resum all the radiative corrections , in the end , our result should be recovered .",
    "this appears quite difficult , at the present , but our approach is already amenable to experimental tests .",
    "however , a recent computation of higher order corrections to coleman - weinberg mechanism points toward a peculiar structure of singularity of the complete effective potential that could be a precursor to further excited states @xcite in agreement with our approach .    in the end , even if this kind of mechanism should not be observed , it is nevertheless interesting the fact that a perturbation theory for a strongly coupled scalar field can be developed much in the same way this happens for weak perturbations .",

    "we have inserted back all the constants for the sake of clearness . to solve this equation we use the technique described in @xcite .",
