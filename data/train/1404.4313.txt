    "cell differentiation process is a biological phenomenon , in which immature cells of living organisms give rise to more mature , i.e. more specialized , ones , see e.g. @xcite . in humans ,",
    "this process takes place primarily during gestation , childhood and adolescence . during these initial stages of human development",
    "a fertilized egg cell , called zygote , divides and differentiates multiple times , giving eventually rise to mature cells of blood , muscles , skin , brain etc . in some tissues ,",
    "the process of cell differentiation persists during adulthood .",
    "for instance , neural stem cells or neural progenitors , which reside in the part of brain called hippocampus , can differentiate ( fig .",
    "[ fig_neurogenesis ] ) to become eventually mature neurons , which has implications for human memory , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "various mathematical models , focusing on different aspects of the process of cell differentiation , and using various mathematical structures , have been proposed in scientific literature .",
    "they include modeling differentiation switches via markov chains or systems of ordinary differential equations ( see @xcite ) , modeling the inherent stochasticity via branching processes ( see e.g. @xcite ) , modeling delays via delay differential equations ( see @xcite and references therein ) , modeling spatial dynamics via discrete lattice models or reaction - diffusion equations ( see @xcite ) and others .",
    "the approach developed in the present paper is called _ structured population models_. it consists in tracing populations of cells according to their _ maturity level _ which is described by a real structure variable @xmath0 .",
    "the order on states @xmath1 is inherited from @xmath2 , which means that state @xmath3 is _ more differentiated _",
    "( i.e. more specialized , more mature ) than state @xmath4 iff @xmath5 .",
    "this , in turn , means that a cell from state @xmath4 can differentiate into a cell in state @xmath3 yet not vice versa .",
    "we distinguish two types of states :    * _ discrete states _ , in which cells can stay for a positive period of time ( e.g. state of stem cell , state of mature cell ) , * _ continuous states _ , which cells pass without halting ( e.g. the group of states corresponding to maturing neuron ) .",
    "depending on the topology of the state space we distinguish three basic groups of structured population models of cell differentiation :    * discrete models , with state space being a finite subset of @xmath2 and composed of discrete states only ; the dynamics is based on systems of odes , see e.g. @xcite , * continuous models , with state space being an interval and composed of continuous states only ; the evolution of population of cells is then described by a time - dependent density @xmath6 or , more generally , time - depedent positive radon measure @xmath7 which evolves according to the transport ( balance ) equation @xmath8 , see @xcite , * mixed models , which have both discrete and continuous parts , see @xcite .    in @xcite continuous and mixed models of cell differentiation were embedded into a general framework based on measure - valued solutions of transport equations .",

    "this metric , known also under the name bounded lipschitz distance , is defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the set of bounded lipschitz continuous functions on @xmath2 and @xmath31 is the lipschitz constant of @xmath32 .",
