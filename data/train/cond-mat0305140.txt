    "inelastic x - ray scattering ( with mev accuracy over a spectral range of several evs ) has improved significantly over the past few years due to the increased photon flux of third generation synchrotron sources @xcite .",
    "the large cross - section of light - coupled probes ( as compared to neutron scattering , for example ) allows for a systematic study of the dispersive charge dynamics in a wide dynamical range @xmath0 in solids and fluids .",
    "it has opened an additional window to study correlation effects on phonons@xcite , plasmons@xcite , quasiparticles@xcite , charge transfer excitations@xcite , and orbital excitations@xcite .",
    "one particular point of interest has been the study of the evolution of strongly correlated systems as some parameter of the system , such as the electron density , is varied by doping or pressure . while many single - particle properties have been studied via angle - resolved photoemission , important questions concerning the evolution of the unoccupied states are now directly accessible via inelastic x - ray scattering .",
    "recent experiments have focused on a number of correlated ( mott ) insulators such as la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and sr@xmath1cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 @xcite , ca@xmath1cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1@xcite , nav@xmath1o@xmath3@xcite , nd@xmath1cuo@xmath2@xcite , and the one - dimensional insulators sr@xmath1cuo@xmath4 and sr@xmath1cuo@xmath1@xcite .",
    "the measurements have revealed dispersive high - energy and low - energy excitations which have been identified with a photon - induced charge transfer between different atomic orbitals , or with transitions from the lower to the upper hubbard band across an effective @xmath5-dependent mott gap .",
    "more recent measurements have begun to appear in materials doped from their parent mott insulating phases@xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical development of inelastic x - ray scattering in strongly correlated metals and insulators is just starting to form@xcite .",
    "of particular interest is a determination of how the upper and lower hubbard bands and consequently the mott gap evolve with correlations .",
    "as experiments reach greater and greater resolution , it will shortly be possible to track the evolution of electronic correlations from strongly correlated insulators to strongly and then weakly correlated metals .",
    "the purpose of this contribution is to investigate such a theory for inelastic x - ray scattering . in particular",
    ", we develop an exact dynamical mean field theory for nonresonant inelastic light scattering in a system which can be tuned across the quantum critical point of a metal - insulator transition .",
    "we calculate the inelastic x - ray cross - section on both sides of the transition and near the critical point .",
    "the outline of this manuscript is as follows : in section ii we develop the general formalism for nonresonant inelastic x - ray scattering and review simple physical ideas for weakly correlated metals . in section",
    "iii we present the specific formalism for calculating the x - ray response in the falicov - kimball model in the limit of large spatial dimensions , and in section iv we present the numerical results .",
    "lastly , we summarized our results and discuss them in light of recent measurements in section v. this paper expands on results for the insulating phase@xcite to consider metals and materials close to the metal - insulator transition .",
    "light can scatter off of many different excitations in a system , but here we focus on the inelastic scattering of x - rays from electrons .",
    "x - rays , unlike optical photons , can exchange both energy and momentum when they scatter with a solid .",
    "the scattering occurs as light creates charge fluctuations in different locations of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "these charge fluctuations are classified as either isotropic charge fluctuations or anisotropic charge fluctuations ( which vanish when averaging their * k*-space variation over the bz ) .",
    "the way in which the charge fluctuations are created is dictated by the polarization orientation of the incoming and outgoing photons set by the scattering geometry .",
    "these polarization orientations transform according to the operations of the point - group symmetry of the crystal , and therefore so must the charge fluctuations that they create .",
    "it is through this mechanism that the charge excitations in different regions of the bz can be systematically selected and explored via inelastic light scattering .",
    "these charge fluctuations relax by internal scattering processes , such as due to impurities or coulomb scattering , and finally via the re - emission of photons ; inelastic x - ray scattering probes these relaxation processes at different regions of the bz and at different transferred energies .",
    "an important distinction between isotropic and anisotropic charge fluctuations is that the former are coupled to long - range coulomb interactions while the latter are not .",
    "this has dramatic consequences on the polarization dependence of the observed spectra .",
    "we now elaborate upon this further .",
    "we limit focus to the case of non - resonant x - ray scattering since resonant processes have not yet been treated exactly in any correlated itinerant model .",
    "the inelastic x - ray response is given formally by a generalized density - density correlation function @xmath6 \\chi^{\\prime\\prime}({\\bf q},\\omega)$ ] with @xmath7 \\rangle_{(\\omega ) } \\label{eq : density - density}\\ ] ] formed with an `` effective '' density operator given by @xmath8 @xmath9 is the bose distribution function , and the double prime superscript denotes the imaginary part .",
    "we relate the inelastic light scattering vertex @xmath10 to the curvature of the energy band @xmath11 and the light polarizations through @xmath12 this holds in the limit of vanishing energy transfers , but can also be generalized in terms of brillouin zone harmonics to other non - resonant cases . here",
    "@xmath13 denote the incident , scattered x - ray polarization vectors , respectively , and we have chosen units @xmath14 and have set the lattice constant equal to 1 .",
    "we can classify the scattering amplitudes by their point group symmetry operations .",
    "it is customary to have @xmath15 denote the symmetry of the lattice ( s - wave ) and @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote two of the d - wave symmetries . for any dimension",
    "@xmath18 , if we choose @xmath19 and @xmath20 , then we have the @xmath16 sector , while @xmath21 projects out the @xmath22 sector since the @xmath23 component is identically zero for models with only nearest - neighbor hopping .",
    "thus , we can cast the scattering amplitudes into a simple form : @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which recovers the @xmath26 representations of the tetragonal point group symmetry operations commonly used in cuo@xmath1 systems .",
    "we note that if we take the pure charge vertex for @xmath22 , @xmath27 , then @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the dielectric function@xcite .",
    "it is useful to review the nonresonant response for weakly correlated metals to determine where we expect to see the role of correlations emerge . for non - interacting electrons the effective density response",
    "is given in terms of a generalized lindhard function which incorporates the symmetry dependence of the light scattering amplitudes @xmath30 in the lindhard kernel@xcite .",
    "in particular , in the limit * * q**@xmath31 there is no low energy inelastic light scattering ( for three - dimensions ) as there is no phase space to create electron - hole pairs and the only excitation is the high - energy collective plasmon .",
    "this is analogous to the situation of the charge susceptibility , which vanishes at a finite frequency when @xmath32 because the total charge of the system commutes with the hamiltonian . for finite * q * , the particle - hole continuum gives low - energy scattering up to a frequency of @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 the fermi velocity ) . when scattering off an impurity potential @xmath35 is added , this sharp cut - off is smeared , and scattering occurs over a wide range of transferred frequencies .",
    "the density response at small * q * is given by an effective density - density kubo formula@xcite @xmath36 with @xmath37 the density of states at the fermi level and @xmath38 the relaxation rate for density fluctuations having a symmetry selected by light orientations labelled by @xmath39 ( @xmath39 denotes an irreducible representation of the point group of the crystal , such as @xmath22 or @xmath40 for a tetragonal crystal ; we use @xmath41 to denote the @xmath15 sector ) . expanding the impurity potential in terms of a complete set of basis functions",
    "@xmath42 yields @xmath43 the width and location of the peak of the response is given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the scattering rate that preserves charge fluctuations having symmetry @xmath39 , and @xmath46 is the diffusion constant related to the resistivity @xmath47 by an einstein relation , @xmath48 .",
    "here we have assumed that the impurity potential is rotationally invariant and largely independent of momentum transfer .",
    "thus in this case , phase space is already created by the impurity scattering potential for anisotropic @xmath49 density fluctuations coupled to the x - rays .",
    "however , isotropic density fluctuations @xmath50 are governed by the continuity equation and must vanish at * * q**=0 even in the presence of an impurity potential .",
    "therefore , for @xmath51 channels ( @xmath40 ) the x - ray response has a lorenzian lineshape with a peak position and width which grows as @xmath52 for momentum transfers away from the zone center @xmath53 , while for @xmath41 ( @xmath22 ) , there is only low energy scattering for finite @xmath54 due to particle number conservation .",
    "coulomb interactions create phase - space for particle - hole excitations and lead to inelastic scattering even at * * q**=0 for channels not having the underlying symmetry of the lattice .",
    "the scattering can be enhanced when the momentum structure of the coulomb interaction is considered further .",
    "for example , in a material having a nested or slightly nested fermi surface ( fs ) at some points in the bz , the resulting response would be enhanced for polarization orientations which highlight the nested or nearly nested regions of the fs@xcite . in the case of antiferromagnetic interactions which are strong for momentum transfers of @xmath55",
    "the response is appreciably modified for the @xmath40 channel in two - dimensional tetragonal systems@xcite .",
    "the dispersion of these excitations can then be tracked as a function of light momentum transfers * q * just as they can via neutron scattering .",
    "thus , in principle , inelastic x - ray scattering systematically tracks the role of correlations and the accompanying fs instabilities by exploring the polarization dependence and momentum transfer dependence of the resulting spectra .    in this paper",
    ", we are interested in carrying out calculations in which electronic correlations can be handled exactly in a system which can be tuned through a quantum critical point . the falicov - kimball model , which has been used to describe a variety of phenomenon in binary alloys , rare - earth compounds , and intermediate - valence materials@xcite , contains itinerant band electrons and localized electrons , in which the band electrons can hop with amplitude@xcite @xmath56 between nearest neighbors on a @xmath57-dimensional hypercubic lattice and interact via a screened coulomb interaction @xmath58 with the localized electrons : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the spinless conduction electron creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath61 and @xmath62 or 1 is a classical variable for the localized electron number at site @xmath61 .",

    "the vertex corrections do not completely remove low energy scattering for any finite value of * q * , and the low energy spectral weight grows for increasing * q * either along the zone diagonal or zone edge . for large",
    "* q * , the @xmath22 spectra have a temperature dependence similar to the @xmath40 response , dominated by particle - hole excitations .",
    "in fact , the @xmath22 and @xmath40 responses are identical at the @xmath148 point @xmath149 due to the local approximation .",
    "any variation in the signal at the zone corner in different symmetry channels is due to nonlocal many - body correlations .    for low * q * however ( such as @xmath172 )",
    ", the temperature dependence is nonmonotonic due to a competition between increased vertex corrections , which deplete spectral weight , and decreased particle - hole damping , which aggregates spectral weight into the fermi - like coherence peak as the temperature is reduced .",
    "it is important to note that for an unpolarized ( partially polarized ) measurement , the x - ray response is a ( weighted ) superposition of the @xmath40 and @xmath22 spectra .",
    "however , the spectra at small * q * in a metal would largely have contributions from the @xmath40 channel due to the significant phase space reduction in the @xmath15 channel .",
    "now we turn to our results for a near critical value of @xmath173 where the density of states vanishes at the fermi level and the system undergoes a metal - insulator transition ( our choice for @xmath58 lies just on the insulating side of the metal - insulator transition ) .",
    "we plot in figs .",
    "[ fig : 4 ] and  [ fig : 5 ] the results for the @xmath40 and @xmath22 channels , respectively , for the same temperature ranges as in the previous plots .",
    "the effect of electronic correlations is clearly visible .",
    "for both the @xmath40 and the @xmath22 spectra , two peaks become discernable at small * q * : the low energy peak ( similar to the one seen for smaller values of @xmath58 ) , and a non - dispersive high - energy peak ( at an energy of roughly @xmath58 corresponding to transitions between the lower and upper hubbard band ) . indeed the results at large * q * are more similar to the small @xmath58 results since the landau damping pushes the low frequency peak into the high frequency peak and further smears both peaks . again , the low energy peak is removed near the zone center for the @xmath22 channel , but in this case the charge - transfer peak ( at a frequency near @xmath58 ) remains .",
    "it is important to note that even though the system is near critical , low energy spectral weight is visible , particularly in the @xmath40 channel .",
    "we focus now on the spectral weight in this region as a function of temperature , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : 6 ] . in this low frequency region",
    "one can clearly see for the @xmath40 channel that the low energy spectral weight increases with increasing temperature throughout the bz .",
    "this is most clearly seen at @xmath171 . for the @xmath22 channel the same behavior",
    "is masked by the role of vertex corrections which reduce the spectral weight for momentum transfers near the bz center .",
    "nevertheless , the growth of intensity with increasing temperature is clearly seen in both channels .",
    "the growth is particularly clear at low frequency transfers and for increasing transfers the effect vanishes and crosses over at larger frequencies to a region where spectral weight depletes as temperature is increased .",
    "the point separating these regions occurs at a crude isosbestic point near @xmath174 , where the spectra are roughly independent of temperature .",
    "the isosbestic point becomes less well - defined for momentum transfers away from the zone center , and therefore it is most clearly observable in raman measurements in the @xmath40 channel . as the temperature is increased further , the isosbestic behavior disappears .      turning to the insulating phase",
    ", our results for @xmath175 for the @xmath40 and @xmath22 channel are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : 7 ] and [ fig : 8 ] , respectively .",
    "clearly two features can be resolved in both the @xmath40 and @xmath22 channel : a small , dispersive low - energy peak for frequencies @xmath167 and a large , dispersionless charge - transfer peak @xmath176 well separated from the low - energy peak . here",
    "we see more clearly the development of the transfer of spectral weight from low frequencies to higher frequencies as temperature is lowered , with a more clearly defined isosbestic point separating the low- and high - energy transfers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : 9 ] .",
    "the low - energy depletion of spectral weight and concomitant increase of spectral weight at high energies above the isosbestic point ( as @xmath177 is reduced to zero ) was recently discussed in ref . for @xmath178 ( which lies deep on the insulating side of the transition ) where the isosbestic point is more clearly observed .",
    "the low - energy feature in the insulating phase is determined by thermally generated double occupancies which become unpopulated at lower temperature .",
    "the high - energy peak reflects the energy scale for excitations across the mott gap and is relatively dispersionless due to the local nature of the correlations .",
    "in contrast , the low - energy feature is a consequence of thermally generated double occupancies which open a low - energy band ( up to energies @xmath179 ) able to scatter x - rays .",
    "the low energy peak disperses due to landau damping by the thermally generated excitations , created in greater numbers at larger * q*. these excitations are frozen out for decreasing temperature and the low - energy intensity disappears .",
    "only scattering across the mott gap remains at an energy transfer of @xmath58 .",
    "the charge - transfer peak for all * q * broadens for increasing temperature while the low - energy peak gains intensity from zero as temperature is increased , particularly in the @xmath40 channel . as a consequence , both @xmath40 and @xmath22 possess a non - dispersive isosbestic point  a frequency",
    "at which the spectra are temperature independent ",
    "around @xmath180 . this result agrees with our previous results for @xmath181 in which the two peaks are further separated and the isosbestic point is more clearly observed .",
    "we note that even in the insulating case there is no spectral weight at small energy transfers for the @xmath22 channel .",
    "thus we note that regardless of the strength of the correlations , the raman response ( * * q**=0 ) and the inelastic x - ray response at small * q * should be dominated by the @xmath40 response .",
    "this can be an important diagnostic tool for investigating the nature of charge dynamics in different regions of the bz due to the projection of the @xmath40 scattering amplitude form factors compared to @xmath22 .",
    "in summary , we have constructed a formally exact theory for non - resonant x - ray scattering in a system which can be tuned across a quantum metal - insulator transition .",
    "we focused on the polarization and momentum transfer dependence of the resulting spectra as a way of discerning the role of electron correlations .",
    "in particular , the way in which spectral weight is transferred over different frequency regions as a function of temperature can shed important light on the strength of the electronic correlations , and the momentum dependence of the observed spectra can be used to determine `` hot regions '' on the fs . in general , the temperature and polarization dependence of the spectrum would assist in an interpretation of observed peaks in the x - ray spectrum of correlated insulators for example .",
    "in addition we have pointed out a number of features which reflect the nature of the electronic correlations .",
    "one important finding concerns the polarization dependence of the results for momentum transfers at the bz corner @xmath182 . in a theory",
    "in which the correlations are purely local we find that the response function should be identical at this point for both @xmath22 and @xmath40 scattering geometries and that any differences can be attributed to the importance of non - local correlations ( indeed , they are identical for @xmath155 along the generalized zone boundary ) .",
    "in addition we have pointed out that for low * q * the full response is dominated by the @xmath40 channel which projects out particle - hole excitations .",
    "thus in this limit , the excitations can be directly probed and tracked as a function of temperature .",
    "there is currently limited experimental data concerning the polarization and/or temperature dependence of the observed spectra in either correlated metals or insulators and thus many of our predictions remain open to experimental verification . at this stage",
    "current experiments have focused on collective excitations such as the plasmon@xcite or orbiton@xcite or excitations across a mott gap in correlated insulators@xcite .",
    "our theory would predict several new effects which could serve as a fingerprint of the role of electronic correlations in both correlated metals and insulators by a systematic study of the dependence on temperature and polarization orientations .",
    "in particular one could use x - ray scattering to elucidate electron dynamics near and through a quantum critical metal - insulator transition .",
    "our theory does not address the role of resonant scattering and the connection to multiband systems . to capture resonance effects ,",
    "detailed information is needed about the energy separation of the various bands as well as the matrix elements which couple the valence and conduction bands via light scattering . for a mott insulator",
    "this would include resonant transitions between the upper and lower hubbard bands as well as between excitons .",
    "recently this has been addressed via exact diagonalization studies@xcite and a spin - polaron approach@xcite , and its formulation for the falicov - kimball model is currently under investigation by us . a more realistic theory for resonant inelastic x - ray scattering should also include resonant transitions in which the deep core hole ( created by the incident x - ray ) decays via auger processes and",
    "must also include the strong perturbing effect of the core hole on any intermediate states ( such as band states or collective modes of the system such as plasmons or magnons ) accessible to scattering transitions@xcite .",
    "we have also chosen to focus on the paramagnetic metal to paramagnetic insulator transition .",
    "the falicov - kimball model however possesses phases containing charge order and phase separation .",
    "it would be extremely useful to examine the excitations in the ordered phases via light scattering in this model .",
    "more generally , dynamical mean field theory can be used to address the excitations in the ordered phase of this model as well as the hubbard model .",
    "we close with a discussion of the applicability of our results for the limit of large dimensions to finite dimensional systems .",
    "one important consequence of lower dimensions would be that the self energy and irreducible vertex function will not be strictly local and the momentum dependence may crucially alter not only the formalism but also the spectral evolution of the response as correlations are changed via doping .",
    "particularly the spectra might show dispersive features which are much more complex than the ones we observed in these calculations .",
    "we again note that the inelastic x - ray spectra for momentum transfers at the bz corner would be very useful to quantify the importance of these non - local correlations .",
    "one should note , however , that the `` roughness '' of the fermi surface actually simplifies as the dimensionality is lowered , so the infinite-@xmath57 results already include many complex geometrical effects of the infinite - dimensional hypercubic fermi surface .",
