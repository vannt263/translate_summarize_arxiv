    "the sequestration of co@xmath0 in geological formations is widely considered to be an important approach for mitigating the rise of atmospheric co@xmath0 levels @xcite . deep saline aquifers and gas fields are primarily chosen for storage @xcite .",
    "supercritical co@xmath0 is injected into these porous media while displacing another fluid , brine @xcite .",
    "the co@xmath0 then gradually dissolves ; however , its long - term fate remains poorly understood @xcite .",
    "here we address the long time scale and study theoretically the evolution of the co@xmath0 after injection into the brine - rock system .",
    "as the co@xmath0 is injected into the brine - rock environment , it initially becomes trapped , either by a physical mechanism in the presence of low permeability rocks , or by retention as a separate phase in the pore space due to interfacial tension @xcite .",
    "the disordered structure of the void spaces forces the injected fluid along certain paths that create regions , or bubbles , of the injected fluid amid regions of the defending fluid , and vice versa @xcite .",
    "this process is known as invasion percolation when , as for the supercritical co@xmath0 , the invading fluid is non - wetting . for two immiscible fluids ,",
    "the fluid configuration is often determined by the structure of the rock and by surface tension effects .",
    "further , the two - phase system can become unstable when reactant particles migrate from one phase to the other and change the chemical composition of each phase @xcite . within the high co@xmath0 phase , minerals dissolve ; diffusion causes minerals and carbonate species to migrate from high concentration to low concentration regions , and a fraction of them precipitates . in nature , this process can be seen in hot springs , when a bubble of oxygen emerges from photosynthetic cyanobacteria @xcite .",
    "the high gradient of co@xmath0 between the bubble and the surrounding water leads to loss of co@xmath0 in the vicinity of the bubble , drives up the saturation level , and eventually a crust is created around the bubble . in general , mineral precipitation on a small boundary layer at the interface may lead to lower diffusivity and slower kinetics . in the carbon sequestration process , this may cause a mechanical trapping of the co@xmath0 bubble and lower the solidification rate of the carbon minerals .    here",
    "we develop theoretical understanding of this process of mechanical phase separation .",
    "we consider two scales : at the microscale , a single co@xmath0 bubble is surrounded by brine in the void space of a porous medium . in this case , the reactions occur at the interface between the bubble and the brine , as the co@xmath0 dissolves and reduces the ph in its vicinity .",
    "the macroscale averages over many such bubbles . in this case , a high concentration of the invaded co@xmath0 changes the properties of a macroscopic region .",
    "the region becomes more acidic and no precipitation occurs unless the carbonate species migrate to a different region .",
    "the paper begins by addressing the macroscale problem and the mathematical background of the reactive diffusion equation .",
    "we then study the mobility change in the fluid - rock system due to the precipitate minerals .",
    "finally , we consider the microscale case of a single co@xmath0 bubble amid brine and suggest a second mechanism that may also lead to separation and self - sealing .",
    "the injection of supercritical co@xmath0 ( scco@xmath0 ) into a porous medium , initially occupied with another fluid , i.e. , brine ( salty water ) , generates two different regions in the system @xcite .",
    "the first region is where the co@xmath0 displaced most of the existing brine . in this region ,",
    "the void space in the porous medium is filled with bubbles of co@xmath0 and water saturated with carbonate species .",
    "the co@xmath0 dissolves rapidly in the water to reach equilibrium which results in low ph , and also a high concentration of dissolved minerals @xcite .",
    "the second region is the intact brine - rock system , which is characterized by a low concentration of co@xmath0 and higher ph .",
    "[ phases ] depicts the complexity of the co@xmath0-brine - rock system .",
    "bubbles ( black ) surrounded by brine ( green ) and grains of the rock ( red ) . _ ( lower right ) _ region * 2 * is the brine - rock system . ]",
    "the existence of two phases and concentration gradients drives the components to migrate from one phase to another .",
    "as they diffuse , they react to reach a local equilibrium .",
    "although pure scco@xmath0 may be clogged due to mechanical or capillary trapping @xcite , in the presence of water it can dissolve into its ionic forms , i.e. bicarbonate and carbonic acid , until it reaches a local thermodynamical equilibrium @xcite .",
    "these carbonate species may diffuse more easily through the brine . within the high co@xmath0 phase ,",
    "minerals dissolve because of the acidic environment .",
    "they then migrate from high concentration to low concentration regions and a fraction of them precipitates .",
    "the evolution of each component can be described by the reactive diffusion equation @xmath1 here , the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , are the concentration of the co@xmath0 , hco@xmath4 , co@xmath5 , h@xmath6 and the mineral ca@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 is the isotropic diffusion coefficient for the @xmath9th component , and @xmath10 is the reaction rate defined by the carbonate system @xcite and the dissolution and precipitation of calcite mineral .",
    "the latter can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the density of precipitated calcite .",
    "the rate coefficient is defined by @xcite @xmath13 + k_{+2}[\\mathrm{co}_2]+ k_{+3}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the reactive surface area , and k@xmath15 are the rate constants for the forward reactions .",
    "the saturation ratio @xcite @xmath16 is defined by the ion activity product divided by the solubility constant of calcite .",
    "details of the reactions and the values of the reaction constants can be found in ref .",
    "whether the calcite will precipitate or dissolve is determined by the value of @xmath17 ; when @xmath18 dissolution occurs ; when @xmath19 mineral precipitates , and when @xmath20 the system is at equilibrium .",
    "in our model , we assume that there is no diffusion of the solid mineral as it nucleates and precipitates at the surface of the rock . also , the capillary forces between the scco@xmath0 and the water prevent the mixing between the two phases ; therefore the diffusion constant of co@xmath0 is also set to zero . since the dissolution of calcite is considerably fast compared to dissolution of other minerals , we assume that , after injection , calcite dissolves quickly until it reaches equilibrium .",
    "only new calcite that has been precipitated can be dissolved again .",
    "thus , the reactive surface area is set to zero , as long as there is no previous precipitation of calcite .",
    "we solve the reactive diffusion equations ( eqs . and ) for each component using galerkin finite elements method on quadratic triangular grid with a @xmath21 order runge - kutta integration scheme .",
    "the simulation starts when the carbonate system , the ph , and the dissolved calcium mineral are at local equilibrium in each phase . in region 1 , the carbonate - rich brine - rock region ( see fig . [ phases ] )",
    ", we set the ph to @xmath22 and the total dissolved inorganic carbon to @xmath23 mol / liter . in region 2 , we set ph@xmath24 and the carbonate concentration at @xmath25 mol / liter .",
    "the simulation starts with the concentration of each one of the carbonate species and the dissolved calcium mineral at local equilibrium in each region .",
    "we consider a carbonate - rich circular shape ( region 1 ) is surrounded by brine ( region 2 ) .",
    "we find that the accumulation of calcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ circ ] , occurs on a small boundary layer close to the interface .",
    "the precipitation profile is approximated by the typical diffusion length @xmath26 , shown in fig .",
    "[ profile ] .",
    "[ cur ] shows qualitatively how the interface curvature alters the mineral precipitation .",
    "we find that the accumulated crust is highly dependent on the curvature of the interface due to the nature of a diffusion process through a curved interface @xcite ; negative curvature with respect to the inner bubble of the co@xmath0 phase has maximum mineral precipitation at the interface .    , but with an interface of variable curvature .",
    "precipitation is greatest in regions of high negative curvature ( concave outwards ) ]    collectively , these results indicate that precipitation of mineral occurs on a small boundary layer at the interface and a carbonate crust , created in a small boundary layer , can lead to a mechanical separation of the two phases .",
    "mineral precipitation along the interface changes the porosity of the rock , decreases the effective diffusivity , and may clog existing voids @xcite .",
    "the decrease in the mobility of the ions in the solution could bring further solidification of minerals to a halt . whether a pathway between pores will be clogged or not is highly dependent on the local density of the accumulated mineral , which depends also on the amount of the carbonate species , and the size and the shape of the domain noted as region 1 . to study how a change in the size alters the maximum mineral density , we initiate a 1-dimensional domain of size _",
    "d _ of region 1 , and run the simulation until equilibrium . during the simulation , the mineral density reaches a maximum and then decreases as the solution at the interface become more acidic .",
    "we calculate the maximum calcite concentration @xmath12 as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "we obtain a power law relationship @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ size ] .    .",
    "]    the exponent @xmath30 can be approximated by a simple scaling analysis .",
    "consider the reactive diffusion equation , eq . .",
    "changing the equation into dimensionless variables , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , leads to @xmath33 and from eq .",
    "[ calcite ] , the density of the precipitated mineral becomes @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 correspond to the concentration of ca@xmath7 and co@xmath37 .    if @xmath35 and @xmath36 are purely diffusion controlled , i.e. if the reaction term in eq",
    "can be neglected , the accumulated precipitation scales like @xmath38 . in practice",
    ", the exponent may be lower than 2 because of the contribution of the reaction terms that change the equilibrium state in our system .",
    "the diffusivity in a porous medium depends on several factors which are related to the pore geometry and the effective porosity accessible by diffusion @xcite . for simplicity , we consider the permeability reduction to be linear with the porosity loss and mineral precipitation , and the effective diffusivity @xmath39 to be linear with the porosity @xmath40 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the bulk diffusivity corresponding to the initial porosity , @xmath43 is the porosity available for transport , @xmath44 is the maximum density of the precipitated mineral and @xmath45 is a critical accumulated density in which @xmath39 vanishes .     with @xmath46 . _",
    "red squares _ : the results allowing the porosity to decrease and the effective diffusivity @xmath39 to decrease as the precipitation grows . note the enhanced precipitation when the critical porosity , @xmath45 , is reached . at this point , particles can not cross between the regions , and the system seeks a local chemical equilibrium . ]    as the accumulated mineral reaches the critical porosity , it changes locally the permeability and mechanical separation may occur due to diffusivity loss and self - sealing .",
    "we also observe that while the diffusion coefficient decreases , it creates even more precipitation in a smaller area close to the interface .",
    "these results , shown in fig .",
    "[ eff ] , are in agreement with the diffusion length scale of @xmath47 from the numerical approximation and the mineral precipitation of @xmath48 from eq . .",
    "in addition , when the system is clogged , i.e. when the effective diffusivity goes to zero , the system seeks a local chemical equilibrium .    from the numerical results , we can identify two trapping mechanisms that occur as particles migrate from one region to the other . for small carbonate - rich regions ,",
    "the co@xmath0 dissolves completely into the brine and the low ph does not allow a significant precipitation of the carbonate minerals .",
    "thus , the co@xmath0 is trapped in its dissolved forms . for larger regions ,",
    "solidification of minerals stops as clogging occurs , and the developed crust separates the two regions . in both cases",
    "the total amount of the precipitated carbonate minerals is small compare to concentrations of the other carbonate species .",
    "in this section , we discuss a mechanism that leads to a carbonate - encrusted bubble , in which a single bubble of pure co@xmath0 surrounded by brine develops a crust at the interface . unlike the upscaled case discussed above , where each region consists of the same ingredients but with a different concentration , here we have a pure bubble ( no upscaling ) with only co@xmath0 , either in a liquid phase or gas phase . the problem is pictured in fig .",
    "[ pco2 ] .    in this case",
    ", no chemical reactions occur inside the co@xmath0 bubble ; reactions instead occur only at the interface with the brine .",
    "the co@xmath0 then dissolves into the brine , creates charged carbonate species and reduces the ph in its vicinity .",
    "most of the components diffuse slowly away from the interface , however , the protons in water diffuse faster due to structural diffusion , also known as the grotthoss mechanism @xcite .",
    "the concentration gradient with unequal diffusivities generates an electrical field that slows down the rapidly diffusing protons , but also attracts positively charged minerals toward the interface .",
    "( the dynamics is described by the nernst - planck equations @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to supersaturation at the interface and mineral precipitation .",
    "this process suggest that an isolated bubble can remain stable due to a self - sealing mechanism .",
    "we have shown that in a system of reactive fluids , a gradient in the concentration between regions leads to a supersaturation at the interface and to precipitation and porosity loss .",
    "a local change in the porosity reduces permeability and may cause mechanical separation .",
    "this process is important in understanding the long - term sequestration of carbon dioxide in subsurface geological formation .",
    "we predict that a small domain of a region consisting mostly of the carbonate species in an acidic environment will dissolve completely into the brine .",
    "larger domains are more likely to be self - sealed , and only a fraction of the carbonate species will be precipitated . for a single co@xmath0 bubble in brine solution , we suggest a mechanism that causes self - sealing due to the ph gradient at the interface of the bubble and structural diffusion .",
    "our results suggest that only a small fraction of the injected co@xmath0 is converted to a solid mineral .",
    "the remainder stays in its dissolved ionic form or is trapped in its original form . whether a domain will go into dissolution trapping or mechanical separation depends on the concentration gradients , the properties of the rock and the porosity available for transport",
