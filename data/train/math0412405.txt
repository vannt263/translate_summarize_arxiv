    "the aim of this note is to present a new construction of khler metrics of constant scalar curvature ( csc ) on complex surfaces . in order to introduce our results ,",
    "let us introduce the terms `` positive csc '' to mean `` constant positive scalar curvature '' , `` zero csc '' for `` ( constant ) zero scalar curvature '' and `` negative csc '' for `` constant negative scalar curvature '' .",
    "our construction gives rise to many families of examples , but in this introduction we shall focus on @xmath0 we note that if @xmath1 then @xmath2 can also be viewed as a @xmath3-fold blow - up of @xmath4 .",
    "of course , the above description of @xmath2 does not fix its complex structure : this will depend on the location of the centres of the blow - ups .",
    "our first result gives positive csc khler metrics in a family of khler classes on @xmath2 , for @xmath5 , and for certain choices of complex structure .",
    "we note that if @xmath6 then @xmath2 is fano and the work of tian @xcite and others gives positive khler ",
    "einstein metrics on @xmath2 .",
    "our result is new in that it produces csc metrics on @xmath7 as well as csc metrics on @xmath8 and @xmath9 in khler classes that are `` arbitrarily far '' from @xmath10 :    [ cp9 ] for @xmath11 , there exists a @xmath12-point blow - up @xmath13 of @xmath14 with no non - trivial holomorphic vector field and the following properties .",
    "let @xmath15 be a generic rational curve of @xmath14 .",
    "for every constant @xmath16 and @xmath17 , there exists a khler metric @xmath18 of strictly positive constant scalar curvature on @xmath13 such that @xmath19\\cdot f}{\\sqrt{[\\omega]^2 } } - c \\right |\\leq { \\varepsilon}.\\ ] ]    this theorem can be thought of as an exploration of the khler cone on certain del pezzo surfaces .",
    "we are asking the question : which khler classes can be realized by khler metrics of strictly positive constant scalar curvature ?    for the ke metric on @xmath2 , @xmath20 , we have the number @xmath21 takes the value @xmath22\\cdot    f}{\\sqrt{[\\omega^\\mathrm{ein}]^2 } } =    \\frac{c_1(x)\\cdot f}{\\sqrt{c_1 ^ 2(x ) } } = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{8-k}}.\\ ] ]    it is an observation of lebrun ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the hyperplane @xmath23 does not meet the khler cone of @xmath2 unless @xmath24 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath25 , every khler class @xmath26 $ ] satisfies @xmath27 > 0 $ ] .",
    "since this number represents , up to a factor of @xmath28 , the integral of the scalar curvature over @xmath13 , it follows that _ any _ csc khler metric on @xmath2 must be positive , whatever the khler class .",
    "now we turn to the case @xmath24 . in @xcite",
    ", it was proved that there exist zero csc khler metrics on @xmath2 in this case ( the same result was previously known for @xmath29 @xcite ) . in the next result , we obtain csc khler metrics of either sign :    [ fano ] there exists a @xmath30-point blow - up @xmath13 of @xmath31 with no non trivial holomorphic vector field and the following properties :    1 .",
    "there is a scalar - flat khler metric on @xmath13 ; 2 .",
    "for every @xmath32 and @xmath17 , there exists a metric of constant scalar curvature @xmath18 on @xmath13 such that @xmath33\\cdot c_1(x)}{\\sqrt{[\\omega]^2 } } - c \\right |\\leq { \\varepsilon}.\\ ] ]    in addition , any further blow - up of @xmath13 admits metrics with the same properties .",
    "part ( i ) of this theorem was proved in @xcite .",
    "it plays in this discussion an analogous role to the one played by khler - einstein metrics in theorem  [ cp9 ] , and corresponds to @xmath34 .",
    "again , the new content of this theorem is that there are metrics of constant scalar curvature that represent khler classes arbitrarily far from the hyperplane @xmath35 . inside @xmath36 .",
    "khler metrics of constant scalar curvature admit a good perturbation theory : if the class @xmath26 $ ] is represented by a csc khler metric , then the same is true for all sufficiently close khler classes , at least if @xmath13 carries no non - zero holomorphic vector fields @xcite .",
    "this applies to the ke metrics on @xmath8 and @xmath9 to give non - einstein csc metrics in all classes sufficiently close to @xmath10 .",
    "it also applies to give csc khler metrics of either sign on @xmath37 , by perturbing a known zero csc metric .",
    "it seems very difficult , however , to extend this perturbation theory to give more global results like theorems  [ cp9 ] or [ fano ] .",
    "the theorems  [ cp9 ] and [ fano ] will be deduced from an extension of the constructions invented in  @xcite and the recent gluing theorem of arezzo - pacard  @xcite for csc khler metrics .",
    "the zero - csc khler metrics in @xcite were obtained by resolving the singularities of a zero - csc orbifold .",
    "the gluing theorem in that work applied only to produce zero - csc khler metrics .",
    "the results of @xcite allow us to work with csc orbifolds of non - zero scalar curvature , which are , however , constructed in almost exactly the same way as in @xcite .",
    "indeed , as will be explained below , these orbifolds are twisted products of riemann surfaces , where now the scalar curvature of the factors can be chosen arbitrarily .    in ",
    "9(i ) of their paper , arezzo and pacard make the following construction : take a copy of @xmath2 with no holomorphic vector field and tian s khler ",
    "einstein metric ( so @xmath6 ) .",
    "their gluing theorem gives a positive csc khler metric on the blow - up of @xmath2 , that is to say , on @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath39 , then this proves theorem  [ cp9 ] in the particular case @xmath40 , @xmath41 .    we should point out that in contrast to this approach , our construction does not use any result about the existence of khler - einstein metrics on del pezzo surfaces and may be considered to be more elementary for this reason .",
    "the gluing theorem of @xcite is not specific to complex dimension @xmath42 .",
    "accordingly , in  [ higher ] we give some new but rather special higher - dimensional examples of negative csc khler metrics .      we thank claudio arezzo , denis auroux and frank pacard for stimulating discussions .",
    "we review the construction of scalar - flat khler orbifold metrics of  @xcite and adapt it to the case of khler metrics of constant scalar curvature .",
    "we start with a closed riemann surface @xmath43 of genus @xmath44 with a finite set of orbifold points @xmath45 , with local ramified cover of @xmath46 .",
    "recall first the description of the fundamental group of the punctured riemann surface @xmath47 : @xmath48[a_2,b_2]\\ldots[a_g , b_g]l_1\\ldots l_k = 1\\rangle\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here the @xmath49 and @xmath50 are standard generators of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is ( the homotopy class of ) a small loop around @xmath53 .",
    "the orbifold fundamental group is defined by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the normal subgroup of @xmath56 generated by @xmath57 .",
    "the orbifold euler characteristic is defined by @xmath58 the question of whether @xmath59 carries a csc orbifold khler metric was considered by troyanov @xcite .",
    "let us call an orbifold riemann surface `` good '' if its orbifold universal cover admits a compatible khler metric of csc @xmath60 , say . by the gauss  bonnet theorem ( applied to the surface with boundary obtained by removing a small disc around each of the @xmath53 ) ,",
    "if @xmath61 is good , then the sign of @xmath60 is the same as the sign of @xmath62 .",
    "however , not every orbifold riemann surface is `` good '' : the _ tear - drop _ , which is @xmath63 with one orbifold point of any order @xmath64 , is simply connected but admits no compatible metric of constant curvature .",
    "the following summarizes the facts we shall need if the orbifold euler characterstic is non - positive :    the orbifold riemann surface @xmath61 is always good if @xmath65 such @xmath61 carries no non - trivial holomorphic vector fields if @xmath66 or if @xmath67 and there is at least one orbifold point .",
    "the existence of metrics of constant scalar curvature is contained in @xcite .",
    "the statement about holomorphic vector fields follows either by lifting such a field to the universal cover or from the orbifold version of the hopf index theorem : a holomorphic vector field must vanish at each of the orbifold points .    for good orbifolds with positive orbifold euler characteristic",
    ", the universal cover must be @xmath68 and the orbifold fundamental group must be one of the finite subgroups of @xmath69 :    let @xmath61 be a good orbifold with @xmath70",
    ". then @xmath61 is biholomorphic to @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a finite subgroup of @xmath69 .",
    "there are either @xmath42 marked points of the same order @xmath73 or @xmath74 marked points with orders @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the corresponding groups are cyclic of order @xmath79 , dihedral , tetrahedral , octahedral , or icosahedral respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath61 carries no non - trivial holomorphic vector fields if and only if @xmath55 is not cyclic . [ p1.17.12.4 ]    we need only discuss the last part . the euler vector field",
    "( @xmath80 in affine coordinates ) descends to the quotient if @xmath55 is the cyclic group acting with fixed - points at @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "on the other hand , no non - trival holomorphic vector field on the sphere can have 3 zeros , so none of the other orbifolds can admit such vector fields .",
    "from now we on assume that @xmath61 is a good orbifold riemann surface and we endow @xmath61 with an orbifold khler metric @xmath83 of constant curvature @xmath60 .",
    "note that , just as for ordinary riemann surfaces , we have @xmath84 where the fundamental group acts by isometries on the universal cover @xmath85 which is equal to @xmath86 , @xmath87 or @xmath68 , according as @xmath60 is negative , zero , or positive .",
    "let @xmath88 be the fubini - study metric with curvature @xmath89 , on @xmath68 .",
    "let @xmath90 be a homomorphism .",
    "then @xmath91 acts isometrically on @xmath92 .",
    "we deduce a khler metric @xmath93 of constant scalar curvature @xmath94 on the orbifold quotient @xmath95    the idea now is to apply the results of @xcite to obtain csc khler metrics on the minimal resolution of singularities , @xmath96 , say , of @xmath97 .",
    "we note that the constant @xmath98 can be chosen arbitrarily if @xmath61 is hyperbolic , but must be positive otherwise .",
    "here is the full statement , which is parallel to theorem  d of @xcite .",
    "[ maintheo ] let @xmath61 be a good compact orbifold riemann surface as above , carrying no non - trivial holomorphic vector fields .",
    "suppose that @xmath99 is a homomorphism that is _ irreducible _ in the sense that the induced action of @xmath91 fixes no point of @xmath68 .",
    "equip @xmath97 with a twisted product metric of csc @xmath98 as above .",
    "then the minimal resolution @xmath100 carries a csc khler metric with scalar curvature very close to @xmath98 .",
    "in addition , any further blow - up of @xmath101 carries a csc khler metric with scalar curvature very close to @xmath98 .",
    "we have already equipped @xmath97 with a khler orbifold metric of constant scalar curvature @xmath98 . on the other hand , for each finite cyclic subgroup @xmath55 of @xmath102 with the property that @xmath55 acts freely on @xmath103 , there is an asymptotically locally euclidean zero - csc khler metric on the minimal resolution @xcite .",
    "if @xmath104 , we are in the situation of @xcite , so we may as well assume that @xmath105 .",
    "we must check that the hypotheses of @xcite are satisfied , i.e.  that @xmath97 has no non - trivial holomorphic vector fields .",
    "but this follows as in @xcite , for we have placed ourselves in the situation where the base @xmath61 has no non - zero holomorphic vector fields .",
    "hence , we can indeed apply @xcite to obtain csc khler metrics @xmath44 on @xmath106 . for sufficiently small choices of the gluing parameter",
    ", @xmath44 is very close to @xmath107 , and the scalar curvature of @xmath44 will be very close to the number @xmath98 .    to get the last statement , we again apply @xcite , this time gluing a copy of the burns metric at a smooth point .",
    "the term `` minimal '' applied here is really unfortunate . according to its usual meaning in complex surface theory ,",
    "it means that there are no rational curves of self - intersection @xmath108 . in this case , however , the proper transform of any singular fibre of @xmath97 is always a @xmath109-curve !",
    "the term `` minimal '' is justified by the fact that we are taking the minimal resolution of each of the orbifold singularities separately . only after doing so",
    "is it possible to blow down the @xmath109-curves .",
    "in order to make the results of the previous section more useful , we need a way to generate representations @xmath110 .",
    "a way to do this was introduced in @xcite , through the notion of a ( stable ) parabolic ruled surfaces .",
    "we recall the main definitions here :    a _ geometrically ruled surface _",
    "@xmath111 is by definition a minimal complex surface obtained as @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is a holomorphic vector bundle of rank @xmath42 over a _",

    "ruling_.    a parabolic structure on @xmath111 consists of the following data :    * a finite set of distinct points @xmath116 in @xmath114 ; * for each @xmath117 , a choice of point @xmath118 ; * for each @xmath117 , a choice of weight @xmath119",

    "parabolic ruled surface_.    if @xmath120 is a holomorphic section of @xmath121 , we define its slope @xmath122 we say that a parabolic ruled surface is _ stable _ if for every holomorphic section @xmath123 , we have @xmath124 .",
    "let @xmath111 be a parabolic ruled surface .",
    "we shall now define a multiple blow - up @xmath125 which is canonically determined by the parabolic structure of @xmath111 .    in order to simplify the notation ,",
    "suppose that the parabolic structure on @xmath111 is reduced to a single point @xmath126 ; let @xmath127 be the corresponding point in @xmath128 and let @xmath129 be the weight , where @xmath130 and @xmath79 are two coprime integers , @xmath131 .",

    "the first step is to blow up @xmath127 , to get a diagram of the form @xmath140^{-1 } & & * + [ o][f- ] { } \\ar@{-}[rr]^{-1 } & & { } } \\ ] ] by blowing up the intersection point of these two curves we get the diagram @xmath141^{-2 } & & * + [ o][f- ] { }   \\ar@{-}[rr]^{-1 } & & * + [ o][f ] { } \\ar@{-}[rr]^{-2 } & & { }   } \\ ] ] then we perform an iterated blow - ups of one of the two intersection of the only @xmath108-curve in the diagram . given @xmath142 , there is a unique way ( cf .",
    "* proposition 2.1.1 ) ) to choose at each step which point has to be blown - up in order to get the following diagram @xmath143^{-e_1 } & * + [ o][f- ] { } \\ar@{-}[r]^ { -e_{2 } } &   * + [ o][f- ] { } \\ar@{--}[r ] &   * + [ o][f- ] { } \\ar@{-}[r]^{-e_{l-1 } } &   * + [ o][f- ] { } \\ar@{-}[r]^{-e_l } &   * + [ o][f- ] { } \\ar@{-}[r]^{-1 } &   * + [ o][f- ] { } \\ar@{-}[r]^{-e'_{m } } &   * + [ o][f- ] { } \\ar@{-}[r]^{-e'_{m-1 } } &   * + [ o][f- ] { } \\ar@{--}[r ] &   * + [ o][f- ] { } \\ar@{-}[r]^{-e'_{2 } } &   * + [ o][f- ] { } \\ar@{-}[r]^ { -e'_{1 } } &   } \\ ] ] where the @xmath144-curve is the proper transform of the original fiber @xmath138 .",
    "more generally , if @xmath111 has more parabolic points , we perform the same operation for every point and get a corresponding iterated blow - up @xmath145 .",
    "we now give a practical way of using theorem  [ maintheo ] . given a parabolic ruled surface @xmath146",
    ", we deduce a orbifold riemann surface @xmath61 by introducing a orbifold singularity of order @xmath147 at every parabolic point @xmath148 of weight @xmath149 . as a corollary of mehta - seshadri theorem  @xcite",
    ", we have the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath150 be a parabolically stable ruled surface .",
    "then there exists an irreducible representation @xmath151 such that @xmath152 , where @xmath137 is the iterated blow - up of the parabolic ruled surface @xmath111 as described in section  [ secitbup ] and @xmath106 is the smooth resolution of the orbifold @xmath97 defined in section  [ secfactory ] .",
    "this is a direct consequence of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.3.1 ) .    in conclusion we can reformulate theorem  [ maintheo ] as follows .",

    "then the conclusions @xmath156 and @xmath157 of theorem  [ maintheo ] hold with @xmath106 replaced by @xmath137 .",
    "let @xmath61 be @xmath68 with @xmath74 orbifold points @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , each of weight @xmath42 . then the orbifold euler characterstic is @xmath161 and @xmath61 is good , and we can equip @xmath61 with a metric of csc @xmath162 .",
    "now , we consider the ruled surface @xmath163 where @xmath121 is , say , the projection on the first factor .",
    "we pick a point @xmath164 in the fibre @xmath165 , and give it weight @xmath166 .    for a generic choice of points @xmath167",
    ", the parabolic ruled surface @xmath168 defined above is parabolically stable .",
    "we just need to arrange so that @xmath42 points @xmath164 never belong to the same constant section of @xmath169 .",
    "the iterated blow - up @xmath137 of theorem  d in this case consists of performing 2 blow - ups in each fibre , so that @xmath137 is a @xmath170-point blow - up of @xmath31 .",
    "thus this result yields positive - csc khler metrics on @xmath8 . by adjusting @xmath60 and @xmath171 and taking the gluing parameter to be small enough",
    ", we can get any positive value of @xmath21 in .    to deal with @xmath9 and @xmath7 , we can use the last part of theorem  [ maintheo ] to perform further blow - ups on the previous example .",
    "alternatively , we can replace one of the parabolic weights by @xmath172 or @xmath173 in the above .",
    "the complex surface @xmath7 can also be constructed by adding a fourth parabolic point @xmath174 , and taking all weights equal to @xmath161 .",
    "it is readily seen that for generic choices of the points @xmath164 , the resulting parabolic ruled surfaces are stable .",
    "we deliberately chose @xmath60 and @xmath171 so as to get csc metrics that are far from being einstein .",
    "however , if we take @xmath175 then it seems possible that with a little more work this gluing construction might be adapted to give the ke metrics for ( certain complex structures on ) @xmath8 and @xmath9 ! from this point of view , it would also be interesting to try to extend the analysis to allow @xmath97 to carry non - trival holomorphic vector fields . as the analysis in @xcite shows , it is quite possible for the deformation problem to be unobstructed in this case , although the whole story is then much more delicate .",
    "the proof follows the same lines as in @xcite ( or as above ) , taking @xmath61 to be @xmath68 with 4 orbifold points of order @xmath176 .",
    "the orbifold euler characteristic is @xmath177 and so we can equip @xmath97 with a csc khler metric with normalized scalar curvature @xmath178/\\sqrt{[\\omega]^2}$ ] equal to any given real number .",
    "applying theorem  d , we get the result claimed in theorem  [ fano ] .",
    "our use of the theory of stability to generate representations of the orbifold fundamental group results in a certain loss of explicitness ",
    "one of the merits of gluing constructions is that they give `` nearly ''",
    "explicit metrics , in the sense that for small values of the gluing parameter , the glued metric is close to the original one . from this point of view",
    ", it seems desirable to try to make explicit these representations , at least in a few examples , and this section is devoted to such a task .",
    "let @xmath72 be one of the finite subgroups of @xmath69 as in proposition  [ p1.17.12.4 ] .",
    "then there is a canonical orbifold @xmath179 , where @xmath72 acts diagonally on the product .",

    "we shall construct representations of the orbifold fundamental group of @xmath61 .",
    "let the points be denoted @xmath53 , with orders @xmath42 , @xmath42 , @xmath42 , @xmath74 respectively , and let @xmath52 denote the homotopy class of a small loop around @xmath53 .",

    "the corresponding minimal resolution @xmath193 is the 9-point blow - up of a minimal ruled surface @xmath169 .",

    "taking @xmath195 from now on , we note that the @xmath197-axis is stable under the action of @xmath198 : it is fixed point - wise by @xmath186 and @xmath189 and flipped by @xmath187 and @xmath188 . set @xmath199 , @xmath200 and",
