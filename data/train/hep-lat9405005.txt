    ", arbitrary small disorder leads to localization , in two dimensions there is a phase transition between weak and strong localization as one increases the disorder , in higher dimensions a transition between non - localized and localized states occurs . a theoretical understanding of this was achieved in the papers @xcite . as the schrdinger operator for this model is again the laplacian ( without a gauge field ) , we may expect a similarity between our localization problem and anderson localization , but there are crucial differences : first , our operator is not fully random , because the equilibrated gauge field possesses correlations .",
    "second , our operator shows _ _ off - diagonal disorder : it is not the potential that varies from site to site , but the couplings between the sites . and third",
    ", the couplings do not vary in _ _ strength , but in orientation in colour space , resulting in a frustrated system .",
    "nevertheless , in the following we will try to stress similarities between the two models , giving us an  at least intuitive  picture of what happens .",
    "we have to look for a quantity in our model that may play the role of the random potential @xmath37 in the anderson problem .",
    "there we can extract the value of the potential by calculating the difference between the diagonal element and the norm of the couplings , because this is zero for the laplace operator without potential , see eq .",
    "( [ stencil ] ) .",
    "doing this for our model problem of course only gives @xmath38 , independend of the lattice site .",
    "to arrive at a varying quantity , we may look at a blocked version of our operator .",
    "the simplest blocking procedure one can think of is the `` taxi - driver '' blocking @xcite . here",

    "this quantity now _",
    "_ is fluctuating on the block lattice , and so we arrived at a situation much more similar to anderson - localization .",
    "the blocking procedure has a certain arbitrariness ( e.g.  in the choice of the blocks ) , but a simple calculation shows that it is mainly the quantity @xmath42 that enters into @xmath43 .",

    "let us now look at the field strength norm , or , which is more conclusive , at the quantity @xmath44 .",
    "4 shows this quantity for the same configuration as in figure  2 , bottom , and one can see clearly that the localization is in a region where @xmath45 is small , as should be expected from our argument .",
    "this is true for _ _ all configurations we looked at : _ _ the localization center is always in a region with low field strength sum .",
    "we can support this idea further by looking at the eigenmodes of the following operator , which we called anderson - laplace - operator : @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the laplace operator without gauge field .",
    "so now we are looking at a true anderson - localization problem , except that the random potential is not independend at different sites .",

    ", one sees that the center of localization sits at the same place .",
    "in conclusion we can say that our analysis shows that firstly the lowest eigenmodes of the covariant laplace operator in a su(2)-gauge field are localized and that secondly this localization occurs where the field strength norm is small .",
    "this quantity can be interpreted as a random potential on a block lattice . in this way we were able to draw a connection to anderson localization .",
    "disordered systems are among the most interesting and most difficult models in physics . here",
    "we are interested in the numerical solution of  discretized  differential equations for such models .",
    "( an example for this is the inversion of the fermion matrix . ) as the critical point of the system is approached , simple local algorithms face the problem of _ _ critical slowing down , that is , the nearer one gets to the critical point the slower the convergence .",
    "the use of nonlocal methods may overcome this problem .",
    "for the solution of `` ordered '' problems multigrid methods have been very successfull . even in the disordered case",
    "the `` algebraic multigrid '' ( amg ) @xcite was applied with great success to scalar problems like the `` random resistor network '' @xcite .",
    "but up to now , no generalization of this method has been found that could be used for lattice gauge theory .    in a previous paper @xcite this problem was tackled and a new algorithm was proposed . here",
    "an improved version will be explained .",
    "it will be applied to the model problem described above .",
    "this algorithm is a _ _ unigrid algorithm .",
    "to prepare for the following consideration , in the next section the multigrid method will be reformulated in the unigrid language .",
    "suppose the equation to solve lives on a `` fundamental '' lattice @xmath48 with lattice constant @xmath49 .",
    "we write the equation as * l*_0 ^0 = f^0 , [ fundeq2 ] where the index 0 tells us that it is formulated on the fundamental lattice .",
    "inhomogeneous equations of this type also arise when an eigenvalue equation is solved by inverse iteration @xcite .",
    "we will use inverse iteration heavily in our algorithm later on .",
    "one now introduces auxiliary lattices @xmath50 , called layers , with lattice constants @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the blocking factor ( typically , one chooses @xmath53 ) .",
    "the last lattice @xmath54 consists of only one point .",
    "the different ways of transferring information between the lattices makes the crucial distinction between a unigrid and a true multigrid method .",
    "let @xmath55 be the space of functions on lattice @xmath56 .",
    "then we introduce _ _ grid transfer operators : a^ [ 0j ] : h^j h^0 and c^ [ j0 ] : h^0 h^j .in a true multigrid grid transfer operators are composed from transfer operators that act between adjacent layers . from this",
    "it is quite clear that every multigrid can be formulated as a unigrid ( instead of transferring information directly from @xmath56 to @xmath57 go first to the fundamental lattice and afterwards to the target space ) , but not vice versa . from the point of view of computational complexity ,",
    "a unigrid method is inferior because an equal amount of work needs to be done on all layers .",
    "the basic principle of multigrid algorithms ( for ordered elliptical problems ) originates from the observation that after doing local relaxation sweeps , the error gets _ _ smooth .",
    "hence it should be possible to represent the error on a coarser lattice , because the intermediate values can be obtained by smooth interpolation .",
    "`` good '' interpolation operators are therefore known beforehand ; for example , one may use linear interpolation . normally , the smooth modes are the low - lying eigenmodes of the operator",
    ".    how can we extend this observation to disordered problems , where no a priori notion of smoothness is given ? as explained in @xcite , we propose the following definition of smoothness in a disordered system .",

    "does not possess eigenvectors in a strict sense , because it maps a space on its dual and there does not exist a natural scalar product on the two spaces .",
    "he proposes to look instead at @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is defined by the relaxation algorithm . in case of a matrix with constant diagonal",
    "this will not make any difference ( as long as we use e.g.  jacobi - iteration ) , so this does not give problems with our model problem .",
    "remark that this is not true for a true multigrid , because there on a block lattice a non - constant effective mass might be generated .",
    "in such an algorithm , the definition of smoothness should take the relaxation algorithm into account , as it is done in the amg - context . ]",
    "so we arrive at the basic principle stated above even for the disordered case : the slow - converging modes , which have to be represented on coarser grids , are smooth . of course we still have to show that the definition is sensible and can be used to construct a good algorithm .    as a first step we can see that the notion of _ _ algebraic smoothness as introduced in the context of the amg implies smoothness in our sense .",
    "the error @xmath63 of an approximative solution of the differential equation is called `` algebraically smooth '' if the residual @xmath64 is small compared to it , so * r*_i=_j * l*_0,ij * e*_j * e*_i * l*_0*e * ^2 * e * ^2 .    the crucial step in the setup of the algorithm",

    "we call this method _ _ iteratively smoothing unigrid or isu , because it is a unigrid method which computes smooth operators by means of an iterative method ( and not directly from the given operator as in the amg - algorithm ) .",
    "now we could try to use the same method to define a true multigrid algorithm : just replace the eigenvalue equation for @xmath65}_{\\cdot , x}}}$ ] by an equation for @xmath106 which interpolates between adjacent layers and use @xmath107 as the operator for this equation . in this way",

    "so we will never get a transfer operator that is smooth on large scales . to put the same fact in another way : in a true multigrid",
    "as used for ordered problems , interpolation operators @xmath108 will smoothly interpolate functions that are smooth on _ _",
    "all length scales @xmath109 ( the usual linear operators for example interpolate constants to constants , regardless of the scale ) , but in our case @xmath65}}}$ ] will not be able to do this .",
    "this tells us that our algorithm really is a unigrid algorithm , not just a multigrid in disguise .",
    "it is therefore impossible to apply the usual two - grid - analysis to prove convergence .",
    "furthermore , we can not stop the algorithm on a layer @xmath110 , because in this case the modes on the larger scales would not be handled appropriately .    from the above description",
    "it is clear that the work involved in calculating good interpolation operators is larger than the time needed for the solution of the equation  ( [ fundeq2 ] ) itself .",
    "the following table shows the computational costs of the algorithm , compared to a true multigrid and to a local relaxation . here",
    ", @xmath111 denotes the grid length and @xmath112 is the dimension .    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we studied this algorithm for the 2-dimensional bosonic model problem , as described in eqs .",
    "( 0.1 ) and ( 2.1 ) .",
    "the subtraction of the lowest eigenvalue makes the problem critical , and we can directly control criticality by tuning @xmath3 , the lowest eigenvalue of the full problem .",
    "we measured the inverse asymptotic convergence rate  @xmath113 defined as = _ n , where @xmath114 is the quotient of the error norms before and after iteration number  @xmath90 . for large  @xmath90",
    ", this quantity approaches a constant .",
    "6 shows the inverse asymptotic convergence rate as a function of  @xmath3 for grid sizes @xmath31@xmath33 at @xmath30 in a su(2)-gauge field background .",
    "absence of critical slowing down can be seen clearly , and the absolute value of  @xmath113 is quite small .",
    "( @xmath115 corresponds to a reduction of the residual by a factor of @xmath116 in one multigrid sweep . )",
    "the sweeps are v - cycles with one pre- and one post - relaxation step .",
    "the results do not vary appreciably by changing  @xmath11 .",
    "* remark : * to conclude that critical slowing down is absent , it is not sufficient to study only the dependence of @xmath3 for fixed grid sizes .",
    "our method ensures correct treatment of the _ _ lowest mode with eigenvalue @xmath3 .",
    "but the eigenvalue of the second - lowest mode depends on the grid - size , so the grid - size has to be large enough to make also this eigenvalue fairly low .",
    "because of the large work involved in calculating the interpolation operators , it has also to be veryfied that the number of inverse iterations needed for the calculation of the interpolation operators does not grow with the grid size .",
    "we found that six multigrid sweeps with one pre- and no postrelaxation step were sufficient for this on every layer , _ _ regardless of the lattice size ; doing more sweeps and thereby calculating the operators more exactly did not improve the convergence of eq .",
    "( [ fundeq2 ] ) .",
    "so it is clear that there is no critical slowing down for the solution of the model problem .",
    "nevertheless the question has to be answered at which grid sizes this will pay off , since the overhead is large .",
    "a careful comparison with the conjugate gradient algorithm on cpu - time grounds will have to be done .",
    "we think this will be worthwile only if the isu works as well for fermions .    to understand this success we can investigate the algorithm more closely . to this end we have calculated _",
    "_ all eigenmodes of the covariant laplace operator  ( 0.1)using a standard library function  and a solution of eq .",
    "( [ fundeq2 ] ) .",
    "now we were able to start the algorithm with an initial value of which we knew the error in advance , and to monitor the behaviour of the error as the algorithm proceeds , always expanding the error into the eigenmodes .",
    "so we could check that the fundamental relaxation indeed smoothens the error by eliminating the contribution of the higher modes .",
    "the coarser the lattice becomes the lower are the modes which are eliminated , until on the last lattice the contribution of the lowest mode is set exactly to zero .",
    "we also checked that it is indeed possible to represent the low - lying modes by the interpolation operators .",
    "we calculated that part of the modes which was orthogonal on all interpolation operators on a given layer .",
    "this quantity was small , so the overlap between low - lying modes and interpolation operators is large .",
    "this latter result is not surprising , as we already know that the lowest modes are localized . if a mode consists of a few localized parts it seems clear that we can patch it together from operators which are restricted to a part of the grid .",
    "this suggests that localization of low - lying modes is a good prerequisite for convergence of our algorithm .",
    "7 shows the interpolation operators @xmath93}}}$ ] and @xmath117}}}$ ] belonging to the same gauge field configuration as fig .  2 , bottom .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the different support boundaries are able to single out the different localization centers . on smaller blocks ,",
    "the operators are centered in the middle of the block , because here the restriction through the boundary is too strong .",
    "it is crucial for this possibility of representing the localized modes by the interpolation operators that there exists a block into which the modes fit well .",
    "this is not true for other models of disordered systems .",
    "our algorithm was also tried on the `` random resistor problem '' @xcite , but here the simple method of fixing the blocks geometrically led to critical slowing down ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "this is explained by the fact that there existed parts of eigenmodes which did not fit into any of the blocks and could therefore not be combined from the interpolation operators .",
    "( we studied this by again calculating all modes and looking at the shape of the bad - converging ones . )",
    "nevertheless it is possible to generalize our algorithm by choosing the blockcenters in a more sophisticated way , using an algorithm of amg - type for this step , and then applying the isu - algorithm .",
    "this will be done in the future , using a c++-class library which is developed at the moment @xcite .",
    "we have seen the localization of the lowest ( and highest ) modes in a 2-dimensional lattice gauge theory . this phenomenon could be understood by connecting it to the problem of anderson - localization .",
    "the performance of a new multigrid algorithm was studied . for the model problem it showed _ _ no critical slowing down .",
    "the algorithm is well suited to deal with low - lying localized modes , because good approximations to these modes are used for the interpolation .",
