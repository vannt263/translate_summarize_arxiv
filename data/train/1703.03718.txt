    "inertial forces appear in a non - inertial reference system . but what determines an inertial reference system ? according to newton , an inertial reference system is a system that moves at a constant velocity with respect to the absolute space . according to mach s principle ,",
    "inertial reference system is a system that moves with constant velocity with respect to the distant stars .",
    "if the rest of the universe determines the inertial frame , it follows that inertia is not an intrinsic property of the matter , but arises as a result of the interaction of matter with the rest of the matter in the universe .",
    "alfred einstein was inspired by mach s principle .",
    "the general theory of relativity attempted to interpret inertia , considering that it is the gravitational effect of the whole universe , but as pointed out by einstein , it failed to do so [ 1 ] .",
    "einstein showed that the field equation of general relativity implies that an object in an empty universe has inertial properties .",
    "following mach s principle , dennis sciama in a paper in 1952 attempted to interpret inertia using a model where gravitational forces are described by equations similar to maxwell equations [ 2 ] . in this paper ,",
    "the inertia of an accelerating object is an inductive effect of all other objects of the universe and the principle of equivalence is a result of the theory and need not be introduced axiomatically . but no answer was given to the question of how inertial forces appear exactly at the time when a body is accelerating . in electrodynamics inertia has the name radiation reaction . in an attempt to explain the radiation reaction in 1945 wheeler and feynman created a new theory , the absorber theory of radiation [ 3][4 ] . according to this theory",
    ", the radiation reaction in an accelerated charge comes from all other charges in the universe and travels with advanced waves , waves that propagate from the future to the past , to reach the charge exactly the moment when it starts accelerating .",
    "paul dirac also used advanced waves in a paper in 1938 [ 5 ] , in order to interpret the radiation reaction .",
    "the wheeler - feynman theory revived one `` action at a distance '' formulation of electrodynamics as derived by schwarzschild , tetrode and fokker [ 6][7][8][9 ] .",
    "it is known as the action at a distance theory because charges can interact with one another only over finite distances without a mediating entity ( a field ) that `` carries '' this action from one particle to the other .",
    "it is possible to formulate classical electrodynamics as an `` action at a distance '' theory and dispense with the field concept altogether [ 10][11][12 ] . here",
    "we will follow mach s principle in order to find a satisfactory explanation of the origin of inertia and inertial mass . if the inertia of an object is derived from the interaction of the object with all the other objects in the universe , then , the forces with infinite range that can generate inertial forces are the gravitational and electrical forces .",
    "the force between two gravitational masses at rest is described by newton s law of gravitation .",
    "the electric force between two point charges at rest in vacuum is described by coulomb s law .",
    "both these laws are of the same format .",
    "but while the two forces began with great similarity , they ended up described by two completely different theories , the general theory of relativity and electrodynamics .",
    "but as emphasized by poincare [ 13][14 ] , if equilibrium is to be a frame - independent condition , it is necessary for all forces of non - electromagnetic origin to have precisely the same transformation law as that of the lorentz - force .",
    "let s suppose that we have two objects with gravitational masses and positive electric charges , at a point where the external gravitational and electric fields are zero .",
    "the two objects are placed at a distance from each other so that the attractive gravitational force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the repulsive electric force exerted between them . there",
    "the objects are placed at rest , in respect to us , and they will remain at rest as they are in equilibrium . but what is observed by another observer moving in relation to the two objects ?",
    "let s imagine that if they collide , they will explode .",
    "it is impossible for one observer to see an explosion and for another not .",
    "the special theory of relativity requires that the two objects must be in equilibrium also for an observer moving with a constant velocity in relation to them .    *",
    "if we want the system of two objects to be in equilibrium for each inertial observer , the gravitational force should be transformed in exactly the same way as the electric force is transformed in different inertial reference systems .    in order for this to happen",
    ", both forces must be described by similar equations .",
    "since the equations of electromagnetism are relativistic invariants and verified by numerous experiments , it is logical to think that gravity should also be described by similar equations .",
    "moreover , as we will prove in section 6 , the gravitational and electric forces acting on an object , affect the spacetime metric perceived by this object .",
    "* so , the idea is that the gravitational and electric forces are described by similar equations and both forces curve the spacetime with similar way .",
    "it is known and well documented that we can produce all the equations of electromagnetic theory in minkowski spacetime using the special theory of relativity , on condition that [ 15 ] :    1 .",
    "coulomb s law describes the force exerted between the two electric point charges at rest in vacuum .",
    "2 .   the electric charge is invariant .",
    "it has the same value in all inertial reference systems .",
    "an electric charge produces a scalar potential and a vector potential , which together form a four - vector .",
    "the potentials produced by a charge moving in any way depend only upon the velocity and position at the retarded time .",
    "changes in these potentials are propagating in vacuum at the speed of light .    the methodology for doing this",
    "is described in many of the classic books on electromagnetism [ 16][17][18 ] .",
    "to apply the same methodology in gravity and to obtain equations similar to those of electromagnetic theory , the same prerequisites must be met . but all we have is newton s law of gravitation that is similar to coulomb s law for electric point charges . if we want to apply the same methodology , we need the other two as well",
    ". we will accept them postulated : + * principle 1 * + the gravitational mass is invariant .",
    "it has the same value in all inertial reference systems .",
    "+ * principle 2 * + a gravitational mass produces a gravitational scalar potential and a gravitational vector potential that together form a four - vector .",
    "the potentials produced by a gravitational mass moving in any way depend only upon the velocity and position at the retarded time .",
    "changes in these potentials are propagating in vacuum at the speed of light .",
    "+ so we arrive at the following equations , similar to maxwell s equations , which we will call the equations of the gravitomagnetic theory in minkowski spacetime and in si units . @xmath0",
    "where : @xmath1 : gravit .",
    "mass density : gravitat .",
    "mass current density    @xmath2 : gravitational field @xmath3 : gravitational magnetic field    @xmath4 : newton s universal gravit .",
    "constant @xmath5 : the speed of light in vacuum @xmath6 : gravitational mass + the potentials produced by a gravitational mass moving with velocity @xmath7 at a distance @xmath8 , is as the lienard - wiechert potential :    @xmath9\\ ] ]     + @xmath10{\\mathbf { r}\\mathbf { u}}{c}}\\right]=\\frac{1}{c^{2}}\\left[\\varphi_{g}\\mathbf { u}\\right]\\ ] ]    in the above equations , what is in square brackets refers to the retarded position of the gravitational mass .",
    "starting from the potentials , in order to find fields , we have the equations : @xmath11    and @xmath12    in this way , we easily obtain a relativistic invariant theory for gravity , the gravitomagnetic theory . +",
    "the inertia appears in objects when they are accelerated .",
    "so the next step on the road to interpret inertia is to accept the extension of the principle of relativity for all reference systems , not only for inertial ones .",
    "there can be no privileged reference systems .",
    "we will do this with the next principle . + * principle 3 * + the laws of physics are the same in all frames of reference .",
    "+ the principle of relativity is extended to all movements . in order to use lorentz transformations to any reference system",
    "we should use the instantaneous speed .",
    "there is no absolute acceleration just as there is no absolute speed . with any experiments carried out in a closed laboratory",
    ", an observer accelerating can not establish whether :    1 .",
    "he is moving with acceleration ( @xmath13 ) and all other objects in the universe are at rest .",
    "he is at rest , while all the other objects in the universe are moving with acceleration ( @xmath14 )    an electric charge emits electromagnetic radiation when accelerating .",
    "this follows from the equations of electromagnetism .",
    "since the same equations apply to gravitomagnetism , a gravitational mass when accelerating will emit gravitomagnetic radiation which will propagate in vacuum at the speed of light and is described by the same equation as that of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "according to the principle of general relativity we accepted , acceleration is relative , so the radiation of a gravitational mass or an electric charge when accelerating is also relative .",
    "this means that when a mass or charge is accelerated in relation to an observer a , it emits radiation perceived by the observer a. if , for another observer b , there is no relative acceleration , there will be no radiation .",
    "that is , the radiation emitted by an object is always taken from another object .",
    "no radiation is emitted just in empty space .",
    "the radiation has necessarily a sender and a recipient .",
    "because acceleration is relative , the inertial force can not be derived from the same object which is accelerating .",
    "it must be due to those objects in relation to which it is accelerated .",
    "suppose there are only two objects in the universe , a and b. if b sees object a accelerate , then b receives radiation emitted by a. because acceleration is relative , a sees b accelerate .",
    "so a receives radiation emitted by b. both objects should receive radiation if acceleration is relative .",
    "otherwise , we can discern which object is accelerated .",
    "but at the same time an inertial force is exerted on both objects if acceleration is relative .",
    "in order for all this to happen , one way is to accept the following procedure :    * object a located at a time @xmath15 at point 1 , with position vector @xmath16 , is accelerating for b. so a emits radiation at time @xmath15 , which will reach b at time @xmath17 , when b is located at position 2 , with position vector @xmath18 .",
    "radiation from a will exert a force @xmath19 on object b. * object b at a time @xmath17 at point 2 , with position vector @xmath18 is accelerating for a. so b emits radiation at time @xmath17 which will reach a at time @xmath15 when a is located at position 1 , with position vector @xmath16 .",
    "radiation from a will exert a force @xmath20 on object b.    radiation from b to a is propagated opposite in space and time , in relation to the radiation from a to b. the time @xmath15 related to time @xmath17 with the equation :    @xmath21    the sign in the equation ( 3.1 ) is determined by the principle of causality .",
    "the cause must precede the effect .    *",
    "if a accelerates first , a perceives as inertial force the radiation of b. * if b accelerates first , b perceives as inertial force the radiation of a.    if a is accelerating first , the radiation is propagated to the object b with retarded waves .",
    "object a perceives as inertial force the radiation of b which is propagated from object b on the object a with advanced waves .",
    "both waves , retarded and advanced , are solutions of the maxwell equations .",
    "an object exerts a force on another object with radiation .",
    "but there is no reason to treat the force of radiation differently from the other forces .",
    "so we accept that the procedure described above applies to all forces .",
    "the principle of general relativity leads us to the relativistic generalization of the third law of newton : + * principle 4 * + when an object a moves in any way and is located at time @xmath15 at a point with position vector @xmath16 , it exerts a force - action @xmath19 at time @xmath17 , on an object b , located at a point with position vector @xmath18 , moving in any way , then b exerts a force - reaction @xmath22 on @xmath23 at time @xmath15 with : + @xmath24 . +",
    "* comments on principle 4 *    * what is transmitted and has the effect of exerting force on one object is the potential of another object . *",
    "the action is the cause and the reaction is the effect . without action there is no reaction .",
    "thus , the principle of causality is not violated .",
    "* the above procedure always happens as a whole , i.e. action is always accompanied by reaction .",
    "so the concept of the field is auxiliary and not essential .",
    "it is only useful for calculations .",
    "* at this point , we must make it clear that if we deal with phenomena occurring on our planet , the reaction comes from some thousandths or millionths of a second in the future . * in classical physics",
    "we accept that the forces are transmitted instantaneously , and prove the principle of conservation of momentum from the third law of newton . now",
    ", with the relativistic generalization of the third law of newton , we can prove the principle of conservation of momentum also for forces that are transmitted with finite speed .",
    "* strange as it may seem , if we want to interpret phenomena such as quantum entanglement , the possibility for a particle to receive the reaction from all other particles at exactly the moment when some force exerted on it , appears necessary [ 19 ] .",
    "having created all the tools we need , we can now move on and consider an accelerated object .",
    "+      suppose we have a universe where all objects contained are at rest .",
    "suppose we have a point k where @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the gravitational scalar potential at point k from all the universe .",
    "we place an object s , with gravitational mass @xmath6 , at rest at point k. the resultant gravitational force exerted on the object s is zero .",
    "the gravitational vector potential is zero , at the rest frame of s , since all objects are at rest in relation to s.    a force @xmath19 begins to be exerted on object s and it starts to move .",
    "suppose at time @xmath15 object s is moving with velocity @xmath7 and acceleration @xmath27 in relation to the other objects in the universe .",
    "changes of the potentials of object s are propagated at the speed of light to the other objects , where they arrive at various later times @xmath28 , different for every object , with : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the distance travelled to reach every object .",
    "since velocity and acceleration are relative , at the rest frame of s , the other objects move with velocity @xmath31 and acceleration @xmath32 at the specific times @xmath28 .",
    "the changes of the potentials of the other objects propagate backward in space and time and arrive at the time @xmath15 at object s. these changes cause at time @xmath15 , a force @xmath22 to object s that we call gravitational inertial force .",
    "now the advanced gravitational vector potential @xmath33 in the rest frame of s at time @xmath15 is not zero but it will be from equation ( 2.2 ) : @xmath34_{advanced}\\ ] ] the gravitational scalar potential changes but continues to be : @xmath35_{adv}=0 $ ] , because if an object is in equilibrium to point k because @xmath25 , it is in equilibrium for any observer .",
    "what is in square brackets refers to a later time than time @xmath15 . with this in mind",
    ", we can then remove the square brackets :    @xmath36     + the gravitational force exerted on an object with gravitational mass moving at speed @xmath37 , when it is in a gravitational field @xmath38 and a gravitational magnetic field @xmath39 is : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath12 + in the rest frame of s , because @xmath42 the gravitational magnetic force is : @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , as mentioned earlier , @xmath25 ( @xmath35_{adv}=0 $ ] with the square brackets ) .",
    "so at @xmath44 the force exerted on s is :    @xmath45     + equation ( 5.3 ) together with the ( 5.1 ) becomes :    @xmath46     + * if we define as gravitational inertial mass @xmath47 the inertial mass due to gravity : * @xmath48 * the equation ( 5.4 ) becomes : *    @xmath49    we define as gravitational momentum @xmath50 :    @xmath51    because @xmath47 is positive , speed and momentum have the same direction as required .",
    "so if you replace ( 5.7 ) to ( 5.6 ) we have :    @xmath52    @xmath53 + this is known to us as inertia force of an object that has only gravitational mass .",
    "we end up to the conclusion that the inertial force received by an object s with gravitational mass when accelerating is a gravitational force and is due to the acceleration of all the other objects in the universe in relation to the object s. so we can express the second law of newton as follows :    * when an object is accelerated , the force exerted on the object to accelerate it , needs to be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the inertial force .",
    "it is obvious that the second law of newton is now a consequence of the theory that we follow , and there is no need to introduce it axiomatically .",
    "we accept that the gravitational inertial mass of an object s depends on the advanced gravitational scalar potential of all other objects in relation to which it is accelerated .",
    "the advanced gravitational scalar potential depends only upon the velocity and position at an advanced time .",
    "using ( 5.5 ) and ( 5.1 ) the gravitational vector potentional @xmath33 becomes : @xmath54 so the gravitational momentum @xmath50 of an object s and the advanced gravitational vector potential @xmath33 from all the other objects at the rest frame of s , are connected with the equation : @xmath55    it is worth repeating that to get here we have accepted that the gravitational inertial mass of an object s is : @xmath48    the total inertial mass @xmath56 will simply be called inertial mass . for an object that has no electric charge ,",
    "the gravitational inertial mass @xmath47 is equal to the inertial mass @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57if we take the ratio of the inertial mass to gravitational mass of an object , we have : @xmath58    we see that the ratio of the inertial mass of an uncharged object to the gravitational mass is independent of the object .",
    "it depends only on the advanced gravitational scalar potentials due to all other gravitational masses in the universe in respect to which it accelerates .",
    "so this ratio is equal for each object when the inertial mass is measured at the same point in space .",
    "this explains why all objects fall with the same acceleration in a gravitational field .",
    "the above results are confirmed experimentally very precisely . at another point in space , while the gravitational mass remains the same , the inertial mass changes so the ratio has another value .",
    "consider now an object that makes free fall in the gravitational field of another much bigger object k. the acceleration the object obtains is such , that the inertial force to be exerted on it is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the gravitational force it accepts from k. so the resultant gravitational force on it is zero .",
    "therefore :    * the rest system of an object with gravitational mass which makes free fall in a gravitational field is equivalent to an inertial reference system .",
    "an object s with gravitational mass which is accelerated in relation to the other objects receives an inertial force that is nothing else than a gravitational force .",
    "so :    * a reference system consisting only of gravitational masses which makes an accelerated motion in a space where there is no gravitational field is equivalent to an inertial reference system at rest in a gravitational field .    in the general theory of relativity the principle of equivalence for the gravitational forces is accepted as an initial axiom .",
    "here we have proved that the principle of equivalence for the gravitational forces is a consequence of the theory .    in the general theory of relativity",
    "we accept that the inertial mass is equivalent to the gravitational mass . here",
    "we have proved that the two masses can be completely different physical quantities but their ratio is equal for each object at the same point , but not the same everywhere .",
    "let us now examine how the gravitational inertial mass of an object s is transformed when s moves with velocity @xmath7 in relation to the other objects . in equation",
    "( 5.5 ) : @xmath48    the gravitational mass @xmath6 and the speed of light @xmath5 , are invariant quantities .",
    "so the gravitational inertial mass will be transformed in the same way as the gravitational scalar potential @xmath26 .",
    "we define gravitational scalar potential resting as @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath59 is the gravitational scalar potential from all other objects , in the rest frame of s , when all other objects are at rest in relation to s. if the universe consists of n discrete gravitational masses and each is located at a different distance from the object s , then : @xmath60{n}{\\sum}\\frac{m_{i}}{r_{i}}\\ ] ]    the distance @xmath30 is measured in the reference system where all objects are at rest .",

    "it is the gravitational inertial mass in the rest frame of object s when all other objects are at rest in respect to s.    we now see from equation ( 5.13 ) that the equation for the relativistic mass in the special theory of relativity is proved directly and not indirectly , but with two important differences .    *",
    "the rest mass of an object s , is the inertial mass in the reference system where all the objects are at rest , including s. in special theory of relativity the rest mass of an object s , is the inertial mass in the reference system where only the object s is at rest .",
    "* the gravitational inertial mass of an object s varies only when s moves in relation to the other objects and not when s moves in relation to an observer .",

    "we observe that the gravitational rest mass of an object s depends on the distance of the other objects in respect to which it is accelerated .",
    "if we have an object only with gravitational mass , the total rest mass @xmath65 is the gravitational rest mass @xmath66 .",

    "let us think that our galaxy with a diameter of about one hundred thousand light years is far from the closest large galaxy , the andromeda galaxy , which is almost identical to our own , one and a half million light years .",
    "the inertial mass of a star located at an average distance from the center of the milky way is affected almost fifty times more from the milky way than the andromeda galaxy . in order to find fifty galaxies like andromeda",
    ", we have to include galaxies that are almost twenty million light years far .",
    "so it seems that the position where a star is situated in a galaxy , affects significantly the inertial mass of the star . in places with higher density of stars",
    "the inertial mass of a star will be greater .",
    "two stars with the same gravitational mass have different inertial masses if they are in a different position in a galaxy .",
    "the star that is far from the center has a lower inertial mass than the star that is located near the center . to balance the gravitational attraction",
    "the star that is far away from the center will move with greater speed than the speed that it would have if the inertial mass was constant . this higher speed is observed .",
    "the inability to explain why speed is higher has driven to the concept of dark matter .",
    "this conclusion arises from a very simple approach we have taken .",
    "certainly we need to do more precise calculations .",

    "the electric inertial masses of the particles are negative .",
    "we see from equation ( 5.32 ) that when they approach each other , the absolute value of the electric inertial mass increases .",
    "when the two particles approach each other the total inertial mass of particles decreases .",

    "we want to examine if spacetime metric perceived by an object with gravitational mass and electric charge depends on its position in a gravitational and electrical field . here",
    "we will show that gravitational and electric forces change spacetime metric perceived by an object moving in it and not the metric of spacetime itself .",

    "when we say infinite , we mean far enough to assume that the gravitational field is zero .",
    "we want to compare the rate of clock a with the rate of clock b at infinity .",
    "r3,5 cm        because clock c makes a free fall it is an inertial observer , so time at clock c passes at a constant rate throughout the whole free fall .",

    "so @xmath133 is the radial coordinate distance and @xmath136 is the local proper radial distance .",
    "since length measurement needs two points at a certain distance and between the two points space time metric change for rod a , we can approximately accept that in infinitesimal distances from point a spacetime is flat .",

    "therefore , we conclude that when the clocks are in a gravitational field , they are slowed .",
    "2 .   the rod a in position a is longer than the parallel rod b at infinity .",
    "therefore , we conclude that a rod located in the gravitational field outside a static and spherically symmetric distribution of mass expands in the radial direction .    it is known and well documented that outside a static and spherically symmetric distribution of mass , the spacetime metric for a point that is at a distance from the center of the object can be written in spherical coordinates @xcite :    @xmath142    this metric should give us to infinity the minkowski metric in spherical coordinates :    @xmath143    so we must have the boundary conditions :    @xmath144    * the spacetime distance between two events happening at the same point in space , @xmath145 , is :    @xmath146    but : @xmath147 is the proper time at position @xmath8 .",

    "we refer to spacetime metric perceived by an object and not to the spacetime metric that exists independent of the object .",
    "certainly , as we have said , the ratio of gravitational mass to inertial mass at the same point is the same for every object so the spacetime metric perceived by a gravitational mass is the same for every gravitational mass .",
    "so it could be considered that this metric is the metric of spacetime itself , but this is wrong , and this will be apparent when we have both electric charges and gravitational masses .",
    "the ratio of gravitational mass to inertial mass is the same for every object at the same point . in our position in the galaxy",

    ".      from equation ( 6.17 ) arises that the equation relating the proper time at a distance @xmath8 , from the center of s in position a ( figure 1 ) , with proper time at infinity is :    @xmath159    the equation ( 6.20 ) describes the red shift of spectral lines which is emitted by an atom in a gravitational field and is received by an object which is out of the gravitational field .    from the schwarzschild",

    "* however as it emerges from equation ( 6.20 ) , the red shift of spectral lines emitted by an atom in a star depends on the radio of the gravitational mass to the inertial mass of the atoms emitting the light .",
    "as the universe expands , inertial mass of all objects decreases as time goes by as it emerges from equations ( 5.5 ) and ( 5.14 ) . in this way",
    ", the inertial mass of an atom that emits light decreases as time goes by .",
    "as it emerges from equation ( 6.20 ) the light emitted by two identical supernovas ia at different moments in the history of universe , they will have different red shifts .",

    "when we see a supernova ia at a distance @xmath162 it appears as it was in @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath163 then @xmath164 .",

    "so , as it emerges from equation ( 6.20 ) closer supernovas have greater red shift .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed but the inability to explain why the red shift of spectral lines is greater has led to the theory that the universe expands in an accelerating way because of dark energy . certainly we need to do more precise calculations but the changes of gravitational inertial mass due to the expansion of the universe are very useful for the explanation of the dark energy theory .",
    "as we said in  5.2.1 , in a universe with only electric charges all charges in an electric field would have the same acceleration .",
