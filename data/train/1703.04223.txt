    "experimental studies of interacting quantum systems are increasingly focusing on non - equilibrium setups , e.g. , driving cold atom systems or electronic materials dynamically through various finite temperature and quantum phase transitions @xcite .",

    "for higher - dimensional systems the challenges in real - time calculations are formidable .    given the difficulties with real - time evolution ,",
    "alternative ways to extract non - equilibrium dynamical properties of quantum systems have been explored in the imaginary - time domain , where quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods can be applied . in equilibrium , there are solid relationships between real- and imaginary - time correlation functions which can be exploited in numerical analytic continuation of qmc data  @xcite .",
    "much less is known about practical ways to infer real - time properties from imaginary - time calculations out of equilibrium , though some progress has been made on this front recently .",
    "examples include studies of systems driven through a quantum critical point @xcite at different velocities or according to non - linear protocols , where kibble - zurek scaling @xcite can be used to extract the dynamic exponent and other important quantities such as the quantum geometric tensor @xcite .",
    "an important observation here is that real- and imaginary - time evolution are identical not only in the adiabatic limit , where both dynamics keep systems in their instantaneous ground states , but also including the leading non - adiabatic effects .",
    "another example is the phenomenon of `` initial slip '' @xcite , where a random product state is evolved by a hamiltonian tuned to a quantum - critical point and the state initially becomes increasingly ordered , before developing critical fluctuations and vanishing long - range order .",
    "the transient states produced before one reaches the critical equilibrium state have interesting properties that can be probed in imaginary - time @xcite .",
    "imaginary - time evolution has also been used to investigate the emergence of topological conservation laws @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the imaginary - time approach to study the relaxation mechanism of the order parameter in quantum antiferromagnets with o(@xmath17 ) rotationally - invariant order parameters .",

    "in contrast , in a 2d system randomly diluted at its percolation point , we find that the effective dynamic exponent increases as the threshold order parameter goes to 0 , converging toward a fixed value only when the order parameter is small .",
    "this demonstrates a hierarchy of excitations which forms tower governed by a common dynamic ( size - scaling ) exponent only at low energies .",
    "the ultimate low - energy value of the dynamic exponent is @xmath21 , which improves in previous estimates @xmath22 obtained using different methods @xcite .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction our setup will be the following : we prepare our system initially in a fully saturated antiferromagnetic state denoted by @xmath24 , and evolve in imaginary time with @xmath25 where @xmath1 is a heisenberg hamiltonian describing a gapless quantum antiferromagnet . because the ground state obeys the symmetry of @xmath1 we know that this initial state will not be an eigenstate of @xmath1 but it will have some overlap with the ground state , as they share the same ordering .",
    "as the state evolves in imaginary - time it will eventually decay to the ground state , restoring the rotational symmetry of our system .",
    "from the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking we know that in the limit of system size tending to infinity , a set of excited states just above the rotationally symmetric ground state become degenerate allowing the system to spontaneously align along a particular axis when subjected to an infinitesimal perturbation @xcite . in imaginary - time this phenomena will manifest itself as a divergence in the relaxation time to reach the ground state as the system size is increased .",
    "we will use the staggered magnetization @xmath26 along the @xmath3 spin axis @xmath27 as a measure of the restoration of rotational symmetry as our state is evolving in imaginary - time .",
    "the expectation value of this operator as a function of imaginary - time is given by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the imaginary - time evolved state : @xmath30 expanding in eigenstates of @xmath1 , denoting the eignestates and eigenenergies by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , and defining the gap , @xmath33 ; in the limit @xmath34 , the expectation value in eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp ] ) will vanish as @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "since the ground state is symmetric under rotations we have that @xmath37 .",
    "let us define the relaxation time @xmath38 as the time where @xmath39 drops below some threshold @xmath40 .",
    "equation   suggests that as this threshold goes to 0 , @xmath41 .",
    "therefore in this limit , by calculating the scaling @xmath38 with system size , we can infer the scaling of the low energy gap of @xmath1 .",
    "one can characterize this scaling of the low energy gap by the dynamic exponent @xmath42 which has different interpretations depending on its value .",
    "@xmath43 implies that the system has a finite gap in the thermodynamic limit , while finite @xmath3 means the system has gapless excitations , and finally @xmath44 denotes exponential scaling of the gap .",
    "if we consider systems which have gapless excitations , a finite dynamic exponent implies the relaxation time should scale as a power law : @xmath45 . in other words ,",
    "if one rescales the time axis by @xmath9 , @xmath46 should show scaling collapse at small @xmath40 .",
    "for some hamiltonians there exists a large , but sub - extensive , number of low energy states which have energies ( relative to the ground state ) that have the same scaling as the low energy gap  @xcite .",

    "this argument will be important later when we discuss the differences between the clean and diluted 2d heisenberg models in later sections .",
    "the preceding arguments , however , become valid asymptotically in the limit @xmath47 and so it is necessary to take into account finite size corrections if one would like quantitative estimates for the dynamic exponent . as we will explain in the rest of this section , it is possible to control for the effects of finite size deviations by calculating the `` flow '' of the dynamic exponent from finite - size systems in a similar manner as the techniques used in finite - size scaling near critical points in equilibrium  @xcite . using these methods one can extrapolating the finite - size results to the thermodynamic limit .    to estimate the dynamic exponent from finite size systems we start by calculating the relaxation times @xmath38 and @xmath48 ( at some finite value of @xmath40 ) for two different system sizes @xmath6 and @xmath49 respectively . from this",
    ", the dynamic exponent can be estimated by rescaling the two times by their respective system sizes such that the rescaled results are equal : @xmath50 from this expression we can define a finite size exponent for the pair of system sizes @xmath51 : @xmath52 as @xmath53 , this finite size exponent will converge to what we shall call the effective dynamic exponent ( recall that @xmath40 is finite ) which we will denote as @xmath54 .",
    "the manner in which @xmath51 converges to infinite size is determined by corrections to the @xmath55 scaling of @xmath56 . to see this , one can parametrize the corrections to the low energy gap with correction exponents @xmath57 : @xmath58 now modifying eq .",

    "we will revisit this functional dependence in later sections , but it is important to recall our previous argument that in the limit @xmath62 , @xmath54 converges to the true dynamic exponent of the model .    in the following we will test this scaling hypotheses on two examples .",

    "we then go on to apply this method on the site - diluted heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice at the percolation point , where there have been previous studies but not as clear of a consensus as to the low energy physics of the model @xcite . to compute the imaginary - time evolution",

    "for the first example we consider the standard two - dimensional ( 2d ) antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a spin-@xmath10 operator at lattice site @xmath73 and the sum is over nearest neighbors on an @xmath6 by @xmath6 square lattice in @xmath74 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we set @xmath75 for the rest of the paper .",
    "this model is a part of a broad class of antiferromagnet models on translationally - invariant bipartite lattices which are known to have quantum - rotor like low - energy excitations  @xcite .",

    "one can think of these quantum rotor states as the quantization of the global angular fluctuations of the order parameter which in the thermodynamic limit form a basis in the ground state manifold used to create the symmetry broken ground state which is the vacuum of the gapless spinwave excitations @xcite .",
    "[ fig : rotor](a ) shows @xmath77 versus @xmath5 for various system sizes . in this figure",
    "one clearly sees that initially all the system sizes relax at the same rate but then eventually break off from one another when the sublattice magnetization reaches @xmath78 , with the larger system sizes taking longer to relax to @xmath79 .",
    "one may recall that in the ground state of this model the thermodynamic value of @xmath80 @xcite which roughly corresponds to the value where the different system sizes begin to relax at different rates ( see the dotted line in fig  [ fig : rotor ] ) .",
    "one can make use of the continuum field theory description of the long wavelength behavior of this model to understand the evolution of the order parameter in imaginary - time .",
    "the lowest energy states of the continuum field theory are uniform in space .",
    "since the initial state is also uniform , and the system is translationally invariant , the evolution will occur within the subspace of uniform configurations .",
    "the dynamics in this subspace simplify to that of a quantum particle relaxing in the `` mexican hat '' potential . here",
    "the probability distribution of the particle in space represents the probability distribution of order parameter of the system .",
    "since the initial order parameter value is @xmath81 , the initial probability distribution of the order parameter is localized away from the minimum of the potential which for the heisenberg model on a square lattice is close to @xmath82 , as illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : density](@xmath73 ) .",
    "as the system evolves in imaginary - time the energy of the system decreases and order parameter decays until it reaches the bottom of the potential which in the thermodynamic limit corresponds to the the symmetry broken `` ground state '' , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : density](@xmath83 ) .",
    "however , because the system is finite , this is not a true ground state so the energy of the system continues to decay and the mean magnetization along the z - axis relaxes to @xmath18 as the probability distribution spreads out over all possible solid angles ; fig .",
    "[ fig : density](@xmath84 ) .",
    "this second part of the relaxation is governed by the rotor state as they are the states which make up the quantization of the angular part of the order parameter ( and sets the effective moment of inertia which scales as @xmath85 ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we can confirm this intuition for the lattice model by observing that in fig .",
    "[ fig : rotor](b ) , by rescaling the @xmath5 axis with @xmath86 one finds that the second section of the relaxation shows scaling collapse .",
    "a consequence of this is that in the limit @xmath47 the order parameter never relaxes to @xmath18 implying that the system remains in the symmetry broken ground state .",
    "next let us discuss how to numerically extract the dynamic exponent from finite size data .",
    "first one must numerically determine the intersection points of @xmath46 with the threshold value @xmath87 required to calculate the finite size exponent @xmath51 between two system sizes .",
    "here we choose @xmath6 and @xmath88 , defining @xmath89 . to extract @xmath38 we fill a window around the threshold with qmc data and then use a polynomial ( or some other appropriate function ) to interpolate the data and",

    "next we must derive the finite size corrections to @xmath90 which is dependent on the parameterization the finite size corrections in @xmath56 .",
    "for this model it is natural to assume that @xmath56 should be an analytic function in @xmath91 because the model has no critical fluctuations . keeping terms up to order @xmath92 in @xmath56 we find the finite size corrections to @xmath90 are @xmath93 the extrapolated dynamic exponents are shown as a function @xmath87 in fig .",

    "if they do exist they would have relaxation times that would scale as @xmath123 according to the quantum rotor picture , however our method would not be able to isolate these states directly as it can only extract an effective dynamic exponent originating from the mixing of low and high energy states at short times .",
    "the fact that we see a dynamic exponent with significant flow with the threshold value of the mean order parameter in the system  much larger than in the unadulterated system  may in principle be an indication of the rotor states .",

    "we believe that this is the more likely scenario , with rotor states existing in the bulk of the cluster but not contributing significantly to the low - energy dynamics because of their much higher dynamic exponent and much lower density of states .    in this work",
