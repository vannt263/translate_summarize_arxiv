    "the energy scales for the vibronic relaxation and spin - phonon coupling are comparable placing the system - bath interaction outside the usual weak coupling regime which is inaccessible to the traditional second - order perturbation methods  @xcite .",

    "open quantum systems may exhibit interesting non - markovian features that have been drawing sustained attention  @xcite . how to quantify this behavior is one of the central issues . among various definitions of non - markovianity that emerged @xcite , one of the earliest",

    "this monotonicity can be violated and the trace distance may increase during the dynamics , indicating that the information of distinguishability may flow back from the reservoir to system .    in this paper , we propose a new measure of non - markovianity based on the aforementioned mechanism for systems with dynamical fixed points .",

    ", we find a fixed point for the chromophore dynamics .",
    "utilizing the non - markovianity measure based on this fixed point , we are allowed to quantify the non - markovian behavior of the central chromophore .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the effects of the temperature and the coupling between the chromophore and the qubit on the non - markovianity , and it is found that the temperature can suppress the backflow of the information in our model . with respect to the effect of the chromophore - qubit coupling , the situation is more complicated with differing influences of the coupling on the non - markovianity in different regimes .",
    "we will show that in the weak coupling regime , the increase of the coupling strength can enhance the non - markovianity , while in the strong coupling regime , it will suppress the non - markovianity .",
    "in addition , the non - markovian behaviors of the chromophore - qubit pair and the corresponding quasi - particle after the polaron transformation are also investigated .",
    "it is found that the non - markovian behavior vanishes after the polaron transformation due to the much reduced coupling between the dressed particle and the bath .",

    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_c ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath67 thus , @xmath58 is a dynamical fixed point of the chromophore .",
    "more generally , as the interaction hamiltonian ( [ eq : inter_hamil ] ) commutes with the density matrix of the chromophore , and the interaction between the chromophore and qubit is of @xmath68 type , the dissipative process of the chromophore is through dephasing .",
    "thus , all the diagonalized states of the chromophore are fixed points .",
    "dynamical fixed points , which are especially useful in the study of the decoherence - free subspace , will be utilized in this work to construct a new measure of non - markovianity .",
    "to quantify the non - markovian behavior , several measures have been proposed  @xcite , among which the blp measure  @xcite relates the non - markovian behavior to the backflow information from the reservoir to the system .",
    "the blp definition is based on the trace distance @xmath69 where @xmath70 . for a single qubit",

    "the trace distance is monotonous when the system goes through the quantum channels , which can be described by the completely positive and trace - preserving maps .",
    "physically , this monotonicity is explained intuitively by that the information of distinguishability always flows from the system to the environment when the system goes through a quantum channel .",
    "thus , the backflow of the information can be treated as a non - markovian behavior , or a memory effect in which the environment absorbs information from the system and return some back to it , improving the distinguishability of the system .",
    "the blp non - markovianity is defined based on such a mechanism : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the time derivative of the trace distance during the evolution . the maximum is taken over all pairs of initial states @xmath83 and @xmath84 . according to the definition",
    ", it can be found that @xmath85 . for a markovian process ,",
    "the non - markovianity is zero , i.e. , @xmath86 .",
    "dynamical fixed points may adopt various forms in physical systems , including states that are thermalized and ones within a decoherence - free subspace of a quantum system  @xcite .",
    "an alternative definition of non - markovianity is introduced below based on the trace distance in the presence of dynamical fixed points @xmath87 where @xmath88 here @xmath89 is the matrix for any dynamical fixed point , which satisfies the equation @xmath90 , and the maximum is taken over all the initial state @xmath91 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath92 , and @xmath93 for markovian dynamics .",
    "this measure can be treated as a special form of the blp measure as they both rely on the same mechanism , i.e. , monotonicity of the trace distance under the completely positive and trace - preserving maps .",
    "the value of @xmath94 may be equal or less than that of @xmath95 .",
    "however , most of the physical information is contained in the variation of the non - markovianity , not its absolute value . therefore , despite that @xmath94 does not contain as many pairs of initial states as @xmath95 , it is still capable to describe the system behavior .",

    ", there are an infinite number of states in the hilbert space . to carry out the numerical calculation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : blp ] ) , one has to sample a finite number of them . assuming that this number is @xmath0 , to take over all pairs of initial states , it generally requires @xmath102 times of calculations .",
    "utilizing eq .",
    "( [ eq : fix_nm ] ) , the calculation number is only @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , for some complex dynamics with fixed points in it , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fix_nm ] ) provides an efficient algorithm with a @xmath1 numerical advantage .    since the maximization in @xmath94",
    "is not taken over all pairs of initial states in the hilbert space , this measure does not capture the full information on non - markovianity .",
    "this incompleteness of information on non - markovianity is a trade - off of numerical advantage .",
    "however , since the non - markovianity is a property of system dynamics , it should be independent of the initial states in principle . as a matter of fact",
    ", a dynamics can be called non - markovian dynamics if the trace distance of any two states has the increasing behavior during the evolution .",
    "thus , the size of the set in which the maximization is performed is not a decisive factor on the issue of non - markovianity .",
    "admittedly , eq .  ( 21 ) does not give a maximizing set as large as that of the blp measure .",
    "we take a dynamical fixed point as the datum line because it does not evolve over the considered timescale .",
    "we then calculate the trace distance between this fixed point and all the states in hilbert space , indicating that the dynamical information of all initial states are involved in this measure .",
    "this explains why eq .",
