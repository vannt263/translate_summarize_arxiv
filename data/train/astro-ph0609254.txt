    "the association of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with supernova explosions creates an apparent contradiction . on the one hand ,",
    "the observed gamma - ray spectra require the emitting material to be outflowing at highly relativistic speed ( lithwick & sari 2001 ) , limiting its rest mass to a fraction of a solar mass .",
    "on the other hand , the jet expands through a dense stellar core , potentially picking up several solar masses in its way . pioneering work by woosley and collaborators ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; macfadyen et al .",
    "2001 ) and by aloy and collaborators ( aloy et al .",
    "2000 ) showed that a light jet can reach the surface of a star virtually unpolluted if its head travels sub - relativistically inside the star .",
    "in this way , the cold and dense stellar material can be pushed aside .",
    "once the stellar surface is reached , the light jet accelerates and reaches the high lorentz factors required by @xmath0-ray observations ( see also matzner 2003 for a simplified analytic treatment ) .",
    "once this basic question is answered , two main issues remain open .",
    "first , what is the jet launching mechanism at the base of the star and what are the properties of the injected outflow ?",
    "second , how does the propagation of the jet influence its properties in the radiative phase , which takes place when the jet has traveled far from its birth site ?",
    "the first question has been addressed with mhd numerical simulations ( proga et al .",
    "2003 ; mizuno et al . 2004 ; de villiers et al . 2006 ; nagataki et al .",
    "2006 ) . due to the complexity of dealing with 3d magnetic phenomena in the general relativistic regime , these studies are still in their infancy .",
    "this paper deals with the second of these questions .",
    "zhang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) performed fixed grid 2d special relativistic simulations of jets in the cores of massive stars .",
    "they observed a diverse phenomenology of time dependent properties in the emerging jets , including variations in the opening angle , but their resolution was not large enough to draw robust conclusions at large radii , after the jet breaks out of the star .",
    "lazzati & begelman ( 2005 , hereafter lb05 ) showed , with an analytic model , that the star - jet interaction can be strong and can create observable consequences .",
    "they argued that even if a steady jet is injected in the stellar core , its properties at the surface of the star will be strongly time - dependent , so that even the concept of a jet opening angle becomes hard to define in a general sense .",
    "they concluded that the time - integrated jet structure would match that of the `` universal jet '' proposed by rossi et al .",
    "even though - as we will show in this paper - their approximations were inaccurate in places , and the jet structure they predicted is not observed in the simulations , we confirm the basic concept that the propagation of the jet through the star will strongly influence both , generating strong temporal evolution in their properties .",
    "the influence of the jet s initial conditions has been studied recently with a set of 2d simulations ( mizuta et al .",
    "their jets , however , are cylindrical at the base , different from any previous work and from our simulations presented here , where the outflow is set up to be conical in the core of the star .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of a set of high - resolution 2-dimensional simulations of a jet propagating through a stellar progenitor .",
    "the jet is assumed to be already developed and mildly relativistic at @xmath1  cm inside the star , even though it is still hot and entropy - rich .",
    "the energy release is constant and the engine is left to run for a time longer than the breakout time , i.e. , the time at which the jet breaks through the stellar surface . we show that the jet - star interaction creates three well - defined phases .",
    "the first one is characterized by turbulence . during",
    "this phase the jet propagates through and eventually breaks out of the star .",
    "the second phase is a transition phase , during which a heavily shocked jet flows through the opened channel .",
    "finally , a more stable configuration is attained , with a freely flowing jet surrounded by a thin boundary layer that progressively widens its opening angle .",
    "some of these phases can be dealt with analytically or semi - analytically with sufficient accuracy , allowing us to understand the origin of the observed behavior .",
    "the observational implications of such non - steady flows are numerous , including long dead times during the prompt emission and bumpy , complex afterglows that do not obey the rules of the simple external shock model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the numerical code used . in   3 we describe the initial conditions for both the stellar progenitor and the jet in its center while in   4 we detail our results . in   5 we develop an analytic modeling of the jet and its propagation , in   6 we present afterglow calculations based on the numerical results of   4 .",
    "we finally summarize our results in   7 .",
    "the simulations presented here were performed using a modified version of the flash adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code ( version 2.5 ) in 2d cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the flash special relativistic hydrodynamics module utilizes piecewise - parabolic interpolation for computing fluxes at cell interfaces and uses a two - shock riemann solver for solving the fluid equations .",
    "see mignone et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for a full description of the methods used in the relativistic portion of the flash code .",
    "an adiabatic equation of state ( eos ) with a fixed adiabatic index is used . the choice of a single eos for both the relativistic and non relativistic material is dictated by the need to keep the running times reasonable and by the fact that we will concentrate on the properties of the relativistic material .",
    "future work , that will analyze also the behavior of the star material in detail , will adopt a more realistic eos .",
    "block refinement is increased if the normalized second derivative of the density or pressure is greater than @xmath2 anywhere in the block .",
    "refinement is decreased if the normalized second derivative of the density and pressure is less than @xmath3 everywhere in the block .",
    "appendix [ codetesting ] contains results from a number of test problems using this code .    in order to achieve higher resolution near the center of the star and close to the axis of the jet ,",
    "we have modified the flash code so that the maximum level of refinement allowed can be varied over the simulation grid .",
    "see   [ gridsetup ] for details of the grid setup used for the simulations presented here .",
    "in order to improve the efficiency of the simulations , the flash code was modified so that quantities in a given cell are only computed and updated if mod@xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the time step number , @xmath6 is the maximum level of refinement anywhere on the grid , and @xmath7 is the refinement level of a particular cell .",
    "the size of the time step used for computing new values in a cell is correspondingly increased by a factor of @xmath8 . in other words ,",
    "larger time steps are taken less often for cells at a lower level of refinement .",
    "this adjustment is equivalent to having a fixed courant - friedrichs - levy ( cfl ) number at all levels of refinement , rather than a lower cfl number in less resolved cells , as is the default in flash .",
    "the minimum time step is determined by the maximum velocity anywhere on the grid , ensuring that the cfl condition is never violated .",
    "additionally , in the relativistic case the maximum velocity is always @xmath9 ( 1 in relativistic units ) , so the minimum time step is approximately constant .",
    "this improvement in efficiency is generally applicable to the entire flash code and not just the relativistic portion .",
    "although some operations are still performed on all cells at all time steps , this scheme is always more efficient than the default in flash . for the simulations and grid setup described here , this scheme resulted in approximately a factor of 10 decrease in running time .",
    "the tests of the adaptive mesh in appendix [ codetesting ] include this change and do not show any adverse effects .",
    "for the simulations presented here , two different stellar models are used .",
    "the first is a realistic stellar model , based on model 16ti from woosley & heger ( 2006 ) of a wolf - rayet star with an initial mass of 16 m@xmath10 , metallicity of @xmath11 solar and a large angular momentum of @xmath12  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "the model has been evolved to core collapse , and with a final mass and radius of 13.95  m@xmath10 and @xmath14  cm , respectively .",
    "( see http://www.ucolick.org/$\\sim$alex/grb2/ ) .",
    "simulations using this model have names beginning with 16ti .",
    "the second model is a simple power - law model for a star with a mass of 15  m@xmath10 and a radius of @xmath15  cm .",
    "the density profile is modeled as a power law @xmath16 and the pressure is set such that @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is computed based on @xmath19  erg  @xmath20 at @xmath21  cm .",
    "this value of pressure at @xmath22  cm is reasonable based on numerically modeled values for stars of similar size and mass ( heger et al .",
    "since the stellar pressure is small compared to the jet and cocoon pressure , the actual value of the stellar pressure has little impact on the simulations .",
    "all simulations use an ultra - relativistic equation of state with @xmath23 , so setting @xmath24 ensures that pressure is always small compared to @xmath25 inside the star . for both models ,",
    "the density and pressure exterior to the star are set to @xmath26  g  @xmath20 and @xmath27  erg  @xmath20 , respectively . the mass exterior to the star",
    "does not have a significant impact on the dynamics of the simulations presented here , and the exterior density and pressure are set to small , non - zero values for numerical reasons .",
    "a cfl number of @xmath28 is used for all simulations .",
    "the stars in our simulations are not stable objects since gravity is not included . however , the timescale for the star to expand is large compared to the length of our simulations .",
    "after 50 seconds , the end time of our simulations , the material from the edge of the power - law star has moved outward by @xmath29  cm , which is smaller than the distance scale for any realistic drop - off in density at the edge of the star .",
    "all simulations were run on an identical grid setup .",
    "the total grid size is @xmath30  cm by @xmath30  cm .",
    "the maximum allowed resolution varies from @xmath31  cm ( 13 levels of refinement ) near the jet input to @xmath32  cm ( 8 levels of refinement ) far from the coordinate axis outside the star .",
    "figure  [ gridsetupfig ] shows the maximum allowed refinement in different regions . with this setup ,",
    "the grid has a resolution of @xmath33  cm at @xmath15  cm , the surface of the star for the power - law model .",
    "this corresponds to an angular resolution of @xmath34 at this radius .",
    "this is a significant improvement over zhang et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who used a grid in spherical coordinates with a resolution of @xmath35 , and is comparable to zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who had a resolution of @xmath36  cm on a cylindrical grid at @xmath15  cm .",
    "the variable maximum resolution allows the lower boundary of the grid to be set at @xmath1  cm above the equator of the star .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2004 ) used a fixed grid inside the star , and their lower boundary was placed at @xmath22  cm above the stellar equator .",
    "zhang et al . ( 2003 ) was able to place the lower boundary at a radius of @xmath37  cm in radial coordinates , but at the cost of increasingly poor resolution across the jet at large radii .",
    "similarly , aloy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) could place the inner boundary at @xmath38  cm but the resolution was severely degraded at the star surface .",
    "the jet injection is modeled as a boundary condition on the lower edge of the grid at @xmath1  cm .",
    "the opening angle and lorentz factor of the incoming jet are varied between simulations , but are constant at all times in each run .",
    "the terminal lorentz factor , or lorentz factor at infinity , @xmath39 , is defined as the lorentz factor that the material would achieve if all its internal energy were converted to kinetic energy .",
    "it is calculated as @xmath40 , where @xmath0 is the local bulk lorentz factor .",
    "@xmath39 for the jet material is set to 400 for all simulations and the luminosity of the central engine is set to @xmath41  erg  s@xmath13 .",
    "table  [ modelparameters ] lists the parameters used for each simulation . outside the jet injection region , where the boundary values are fixed , the boundary conditions on the lower edge of the grid are reflective , which is appropriate assuming that symmetric jets emerge along both axes of the star .",
    "the outer boundaries of the grid use outflow boundary conditions and the symmetry axis is reflecting .",
    "each simulation is run for 50 seconds , giving an energy input of @xmath42  ergs per jet , or a total energy of @xmath43  ergs assuming symmetric jets .",
    "these total energies are comparable to those assumed in previous works ( see zhang et al .",
    "2003 for a discussion ) .",
    "the early evolution of each of our models is generally similar to that found in previous simulations ( zhang et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "the jet ram pressure generates a bow shock that propagates sub - relativistically through the star .",
    "cold and dense stellar material is pushed to the sides , partly mixing with shocked jet material to create a hot cocoon that surrounds the jet .",
    "this allows the younger jet material to propagate relativistically and unpolluted through an evacuated channel along the symmetry axis .",
    "once this material reaches the stellar surface , it accelerates to its final lorentz factor and can , once it has become optically thin , generate the observed grb spectra .",
    "figure  [ timesequence ] shows a time sequence of the evolution of model t10g5 .",
    "the three upper panels are very similar to figures obtained by other groups with previous simulations , even though our amr code can capture finer details .",
    "the main novelty of our work is shown in the three bottom panels , where the jet is still powered several tens of second after breakout and is evolving inside the star .",
    "as we will explain in more detail in the following sections , three phases can be identified .",
    "initially the jet is confined , and hot turbulent material is stored in a cocoon ( first two panels ) .",
    "when the jet head reaches the surface , the cocoon is released as a wide angle outflow ( third panel ) . immediately afterward , a heavily shocked jet flows outside the star ( third and fourth panels ) .",
    "eventually , a more stable configuration emerges ( fifth panel ) in which the jet is internally free - flowing , and is bounded by a shear layer at the contact discontinuity with the star .",
    "figure  [ rhopg ] shows a snapshot of simulation t10g2 at 30 seconds as an example of the structure present shortly after breakout .",
    "the three phases are identified through the behavior of the on - axis energy flow , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasedef ] .",
    "the transition between the precursor and the shocked jet is defined as the moment at which the energy flow along the axis becomes continuous , albeit variable .",
    "the transition between the shocked and unshocked jet is defined as the time at which the on - axis energy flow drops and becomes steady , without prominent variations .",
    "table  [ breakout ] lists the times at which the cocoon , shocked jet , and unshocked jet reach the initial surface of the star . from these data",
    "we can see some expected trends as different parameters are varied .",
    "models with an initial lorentz factor of 2 ( t10g2 and 16tig2 ) have longer breakout times than corresponding models with an initial lorentz factor of 5 ( t10g5 and 16tig5 ) .",
    "this is to be expected because a lower lorentz factor at the same energy implies less momentum in the direction of propagation and a higher pressure ( similar conclusions in a different geometry were obtained by mizuta et al .",
    "this means that the jet will be less tightly collimated and will propagate more slowly .",
    "model t5g2 , with a @xmath44 injection opening angle , has a slightly earlier cocoon breakout time than the corresponding model with a @xmath45 opening angle ( t10g2 ) .",
    "a smaller opening angle means that the same amount of energy and momentum is initially spread over a smaller area , making the jet more penetrating .",
    "however , as the jet is being collimated , the initial opening angle is only important at the beginning of the simulation , hence the overall difference between the two simulations is small .",
    "the shocked jet breakout time is earlier for model t10g2 by 0.8s , and the unshocked jet breakout is earlier for model t5g2 by 2s .",
    "these differences appear to depend more on the details of turbulence near the jet head than on the initial opening angle of the jet .",
    "simulations using the realistic stellar model ( 16tig5 and 16tig2 ) have earlier breakout times than simulations using the power - law stellar model and identical jet ( t10g5 and t10g2 , respectively ) .",
    "this is because the realistic stellar model is more compact , giving the star a smaller radius and higher density .",
    "the higher density leads to a more tightly collimated jet , which is therefore more penetrating . as a result ,",
    "the jet is able to travel through about the same amount of total mass in a shorter time",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the average speed of the bow shock is smaller in the denser , realistic , stellar progenitor .",
    "we also ran a simulation where a wide jet ( @xmath46 ) is injected at the center of the star .",
    "model t20g5 appears to be morphologically different from the other simulations .",
    "it has the latest cocoon breakout time of any of the simulations , and the jet material along the propagation axis does not reach the surface of the star until the end of the simulation . before this , relativistic material is deflected around a dense wedge of stellar material and can escape the star at large angles , but it does not appear that this would produce a classical gamma ray burst .",
    "this is in part a 2d effect . in three dimensions",
    ", the jet could be deflected sideways to move around the wedge of material , but in our 2d simulations it is forced to be axially symmetric and therefore stalls ( see zhang et al .",
    "figure  [ t20g5compare ] compares models t10g5 and t20g5 .",
    "the reason why model t20g5 is different is that the initial opening angle is too large to produce a tightly collimated jet .",
    "the pressure of the incoming jet falls as @xmath47 , meaning that a wider jet is less penetrating . at 20 degrees ,",
    "model t20g5 is not penetrating enough to pierce the star in the manner necessary to create a grb , despite the large energy input of @xmath43 ergs .",
    "this simulation may represent a different class of jet - powered supernova or failed gamma ray burst , but it will not be considered in latter portions of this paper that compare our simulations to classical grb properties .",
    "analogous conclusions were drawn from previous simulations ( macfadyen et al .",
    "2001 ; zhang et al . 2003 ) and for 3d precessing jets ( zhang et al .",
    "it should be remembered , however , that assuming a wide jet at @xmath1  cm in the star may be unphysical . even if a wide jet is launched at the black - hole scale , recollimation is likely to take place at radii @xmath48  cm ( see model ja in zhang et al . 2003 ) . as a consequence , an initial condition with a narrow , entropy rich ,",
    "jet ( model t5g2 ) is more realistic than a wide fast outflow ( model t20g5 ) at the inner boundary of our simulations .      a snapshot file containing all the simulation data",
    "is produced every 1/15th of a second in simulation time .",
    "the energy flux is determined as a function of angle and time by taking a simulation snapshot and finding all the points that will cross a fixed radius in the next 1/15th of a second .",
    "the energy at each point is spread equally over an angle of @xmath49 from the direction of motion of the fluid at that point .",
    "this approximately accounts for the hydrodynamic spreading ( or sideways expansion ) of that element of the jet and for the relativistic beaming of radiation eventually emitted by that material .",
    "the energy is then placed into angular bins .",
    "the total energy in each angular bin can then be calculated by adding the energy from all points , and correcting for geometrical effects to give the energy flux in each bin .",
    "the energy in material above a given terminal lorentz factor ( lorentz factor at infinity ) can be found by excluding points with material below that @xmath39 .",
    "the results from each snapshot can be added over time to find the total energy seen at a fixed radius at different angles for the entire length of the simulation , or for shorter time intervals . with this data",
    ", we can examine the amount of energy crossing a fixed radius as a function of time , angle , and minimum lorentz factor .",
    "bear in mind that , given the definition of the angle adopted , the energy distribution may be modified by hydrodynamic interactions during the propagation to larger radii . for the results presented here ,",
    "data from our simulations have been taken at @xmath50  cm and placed into 45 angular bins arranged in the following manner : 14 bins spaced every @xmath35 with centers ranging from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , 17 bins spaced every @xmath53 with centers ranging from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , and 14 bins spaced every @xmath56 with centers ranging from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .      in order to determine the observational characteristics of a gamma ray burst produced from our simulations , we examine the amount of energy directed toward observers at different angles .",
    "figure  [ total_energy_angle_16tig5 ] shows the total energy crossing a radius of @xmath50  cm during the simulation .",
    "minimum terminal lorentz factors of 1.01 , 2 , 10 , 50 , and 200 have been used for the different lines in the figure .",
    "the energy has been converted to units of isotropic equivalent energy available at different angles .",
    "the observed isotropic energy would then be the available energy times the efficiency of converting this energy to gamma rays .",
    "different minimum lorentz factors are presented because the efficiency of gamma ray production is likely to vary with lorentz factor .    for each simulation ,",
    "the total isotropic equivalent energy @xmath59 is constant or slowly decreasing from the jet axis out to some cutoff . inside the cutoff",
    ", energy goes as @xmath60constant to @xmath61 . beyond this",
    ", the energy decreases rapidly . in some cases there",
    "is a significant contribution from precursor energy at large angle , but when this is removed ( fig .",
    "[ no_pre_energy_angle_16tig5 ] ) , the cutoff in energy becomes even sharper . for large @xmath39 ,",
    "this decrease in energy can be fit by an exponential or a steep power law ( @xmath62 or more ) .",
    "if low - energy particles are included ( @xmath63 ) then energy falls off as @xmath64 at large angles .",
    "these particles should not contribute to the prompt burst , as they do not have a lorentz factor large enough to produce gamma rays , but they can produce x - rays and can be important to the afterglow energetics .",
    "this differs from the zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) finding that the energy is distributed as @xmath65 .",
    "the difference is due to a combination of several factors .",
    "first , since their simulations are performed on a fixed grid , the resolution is poorer at the stellar surface compared to our amr simulations .",
    "second , zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) consider a small range of angles for their @xmath66 fit ( @xmath67 ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", some of our models ( especially 16tig2 and t10g5 ) could be fit by @xmath66 power - laws in small angle intervals .",
    "finally , their simulation domain inside the star is only from @xmath22  cm to @xmath68  cm , a volume that may be too small to allow the development of turbulence that would result in mixing of the jet material with the stellar material . from our simulations and the comparison with previous work , it can be concluded that the energy distribution with angle is not a robust property of the collapsar , but depends on the stellar structure and the jet injection parameters .    as discussed above ,",
    "the passage of jet material at a fixed radius consists of two phases : the passage of the shocked and unshocked jet .",
    "figure  [ shock_unshock_energy_angle_16tig5 ] shows the total energy from each of these phases in model 16tig5 for @xmath69 at a radius of @xmath70  cm .",
    "the shocked phase of the jet has an approximately uniform energy distribution with a sharp cutoff at the edge of the jet . during the unshocked phase ,",
    "however , mass and energy are concentrated in the shocked boundary layer that surrounds the unshocked core of the jet .",
    "this means the unshocked jet does not contribute much energy near the jet axis .",
    "however , at angles outside where the shocked phase of the jet is visible , the unshocked phase is the dominant energy source .",
    "in addition ,",
    "while the energy in the shocked jet phase is fixed by the stellar properties , the unshocked jet can extend in time and become more and more prominent . only self - consistent simulations of the jet feeding , launching , and propagation can pin down any absolute normalization between the energies of the two phases . at any angle , the unshocked phase only contributes significant energy while the thin shocked boundary layer covers that angle . as the opening angle of",
    "the jet is increasing during this phase , an observer will only see the boundary layer for a relatively short time .",
    "increasing the duration of energy injection will therefore increase the final opening angle of the jet , but it will not significantly increase the isotropic equivalent energy seen by observers already within the jet .",
    "figure  [ energy_time_angle_16tig5 ] shows logarithmic energy ( brightness ) contours as a function of time ( vertical axis ) and angle ( horizontal axis ) for model 16tig5 .",
    "different panels show different minimum @xmath39 cutoffs .",
    "the figure shows that there are three phases in the energy flux seen at a fixed radius .",
    "first there is a precursor phase , preceding significant on - axis energy flux , followed by a shocked jet phase , and an unshocked jet phase .",
    "the precursor phase can be divided in two subsequent events .",
    "first a thin , nearly isotropic shell of mildly relativistic material , visible in the lower energy bands of fig .",
    "[ energy_time_angle_16tig5 ] .",
    "this phase is associated to the shock preceding the jet expanding into a density gradient and carries very little energy .",
    "for this reason it has observational consequences only if the other phases of the grb are not visible due to viewing angle constraints ( see   [ secpr ] ) .",
    "this initial precursor is followed by a mixture of jet and stellar material which is peaked at several degrees off axis with less energy on axis .",
    "this is the material that accumulates around the jet in the form of a cocoon ( ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 ) during the initial phases when the jet is confined inside the star .",
    "this material generally has a lower lorentz factor than the jet and is most clearly visible in the lower energy plots .",
    "a further discussion of this material is given in   [ precursors ] .",
    "after the cocoon material , the shocked jet emerges . differently from the cocoon material , the shocked jet has a large lorentz factor at the stellar surface . during the shocked phase , jet material between the jet head and",
    "reverse shock is passing by .",
    "the shocked portion of the jet has a highly structured interior , including turbulent structures and internal shocks .",
    "although this makes the energy flux and width of the jet variable during this period , there is no clear trend with time in the jet properties .",
    "finally , the jet settles into a quasi - stationary configuration , which we call the unshocked phase .",
    "the reverse shock has passed the radius we are looking at , and the jet consists of unshocked material surrounded by a narrow boundary layer of shocked material . during this phase",
    "the jet does not have the variable structure seen in the precursor and shocked phases , but the width of the jet clearly increases with time ( see   [ openingangle ] ) . figure  [ fig : frexp ] shows the lorentz factor and pressure along the jet axis of model 16tig5 at the time at which the shocked - unshocked jet boundary crosses the star surface .",
    "the figure confirms that the core of the unshocked jet , inside the boundary layer , is free streaming .",
    "dashed lines show how pressure and lorentz factor behave in a free - streaming , pressure dominated jet ; the simulation result is in excellent agreement with this behavior .",
    "note that the lorentz factor deviates from the asymptotic solution at large @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the fact that at such highly relativistic speeds , the pressure - dominated approximation does not hold any more . the comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : frexp ] with previous results ( e.g. fig .",

    "2003 , or fig .  6 and 7 in mizuta",
    "et al . 2006 ) reveals much sharper features in our results .",
    "this is likely due to the increased resolution of the amr code with respect to fixed grid codes .",
    "it is interesting to speculate on the temporal properties of the three phases .",
    "it is usually assumed that the light curve of the grb prompt emission is due to internal shocks driven by lorentz factor inhomogeneities in the flow .",
    "these inhomogeneities are supposed to be imprinted by the central engine .",
    "the propagation of the outflow through the star , however , is likely to modify these structures , erasing some and amplifying others . which ones are erased and which amplified",

    ", all variability imprinted by the engine will be frozen and advected to the radiative phase .",
    "the properties of the inner engine will therefore be more clearly seen in the tail of the grb emission .",
    "unluckily , this is the faintest phase .",
    "as noted from previous simulations ( zhang et al . 2003 ) and discussed theoretically in lb05 , the opening angle is not a constant property of the outflow emerging from the star , nor is it an easily measurable quantity .",
    "we define the opening angle as follows .",
    "we first select all points that will cross a fixed radius within 1/15th of a second ( the same points used to find energy flux ) and with a minimum value of @xmath39 .",
    "we then compute the angles associated with all these points and define the jet opening angle as the largest . in this case , we define the angle as the geometrical angle of the point with respect to the origin and polar axis of the coordinates , since adopting the velocity vector angle introduces substantial noise ( see footnote 1 ) .",
    "figure  [ opening_angle_16tig5 ] shows opening angle vs. time for different minimum values of the terminal lorentz factor ( @xmath39 ) at a radius of @xmath70  cm in our simulations .",
    "this figure emphasizes again the three phases of jet evolution .",
    "as material first reaches this radius , the opening angle is very wide for all but the highest values of @xmath39 .",
    "this is due to the precursor material discussed in   [ precursors ] .",
    "following this is the shocked portion of the jet , characterized by a fairly constant opening angle and no consistent evolution with time .",
    "using different values of @xmath39 gives widely different opening angles , ranging , for example , from @xmath71 for @xmath72 to @xmath73 for @xmath74 in model 16tig5 .",
    "this is because material at the edge of the jet is partially mixed with stellar material , lowering its terminal lorentz factor .",
    "after the shocked portion of the jet has passed , the jet consists of an unshocked core with a shocked boundary layer along the edge . as the unshocked jet passes , the opening angle of the jet is slowly but consistently increasing .",
    "the rate of increase is always less than linear and can be well fit by a logarithmic increase .",
    "the rate of increase is obviously much slower than the exponential increase predicted in lb05 but is in reasonable agreement with the semi - analytic results presented in this paper (   [ analytic ] ) .",
    "the thickness of the boundary layer , measured as the difference between the opening angles for @xmath75 and @xmath76 , decreases with time . for model 16tig5",
    ", the thickness goes from @xmath77 in the shocked phase down to @xmath78 by the end of the simulation ( see fig .  [ opening_angle_16tig5 ] ) .",
    "although the intrinsic opening angle of the jet is as small as @xmath79 , at late times the jet will be over - pressured at the base and expand to a larger opening angle .",
    "after cocoon breakout , the pressure in the cocoon decreases exponentially , while the incoming jet pressure remains fixed .",
    "when the cocoon pressure drops below the incoming jet pressure , the jet will expand near its base by an angle of up to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the lorentz factor of the incoming jet .",
    "for @xmath82 this is about @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , a jet with @xmath79 and @xmath82 can have a maximum opening angle of about @xmath84 .",
    "pressure in the unshocked jet drops as @xmath85 , so at large radii the jet is still being collimated by the cocoon pressure . in all simulations presented here , the opening angle of the jet at large radii is always less than the maximum opening angle for that simulation .      as the jet propagates through the dense material of the star , a high density wedge of stellar material develops at the head of the jet .",
    "the jet material does not penetrate this wedge , but instead moves to the sides .",
    "eventually this material will curl back on itself , creating large vortexes in advance of the narrowly collimated jet ( fig .",
    "[ timesequence ] ) . as the jet continues to propagate",
    ", the vortexes will eventually detach from the jet and be swept backward , relative to jet propagation , in a phenomenon known as vortex shedding ( scheck et al . 2002 ; mizuta et al . 2004 ) .",
    "new vortexes will then develop at the head of the jet in a repeating cycle .",
    "however , when the cocoon of material surrounding the jet breaks out of the star and into the low density material surrounding it , the cocoon material is released and these vortexes are no longer swept backward . whatever material is being shed from the head of the jet at this time",
    "is then free to expand ballistically .",
    "the result is a significant amount of relativistic material escaping over a large angle at close to the breakout time .",
    "even though the details of the process require a 3d simulation for a deep investigation , the formation of a cocoon of high pressure material is unavoidable ( see ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 for discussion of cocoon properties ) . because the opening angle of the jet increases slowly , for off - axis observers there can be a long delay between when",
    "the cocoon material is seen and when the jet is seen .",
    "this vortex material could therefore be responsible for precursor events seen 10s of seconds before the main gamma ray burst ( lazzati 2005 ; lazzati et al . 2005 ) . in our simulations , lasting 50 seconds , delays of up to @xmath86 seconds were seen between the precursor material and jet material at certain angles ( fig .",
    "[ pre_angle_16tig5 ] ) . at larger angles ,",
    "the jet never comes into view , but the precursor is still visible .",

    "1998 ) . whether this faint grb had",
    "a relativistic jet associated with it is still a matter of lively debate ( waxman 2004 ) .      to estimate the total energy contained in the precursor , we first find the isotropic energy vs. angle of the precursor at @xmath87  cm , as described above (   [ angulardistributionofenergy ] ) .",
    "this energy can then be added over angle to give the total energy in the precursor .",
    "the mode and full width at one tenth of the maximum of the energy - weighted direction of motion can also be calculated to give an idea of the angle over which the precursor is visible .",
    "all those quantities are given in tab .",
    "[ precursorenergetics ] for @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "this material is spread over a wide opening angle ( @xmath96 ) , so the isotropic equivalent energy of the precursor emission should be within an order of magnitude of the total precursor energy .",
    "models with a later breakout time typically have more energy in the precursor material , which is expected since a longer propagation time allows more relativistic material to be shed from the jet and because simulations with a lower initial lorentz factor have later breakout times and have less momentum in the jet , making it easier to deflect .      figure  [ pre_energy_angle_16tig5 ] shows isotropic equivalent energy of the precursor vs. angle for our simulations .",

    "the precursor material is less relativistic than the jet material because some stellar material has been mixed into it . whereas the jet material typically has @xmath103 of its energy in material with @xmath69 , the precursor material has @xmath104 of its energy in material with @xmath69 .",
    "a larger percentage of energy in mildly relativistic material could produce a softer spectrum of emitted radiation , as observed in grb precursors ( lazzati 2005 ) and low - energy grbs ( galama et al .",

    "the main conclusion of this paper is that , even if the central engine is stationary , the jet that propagates out of the progenitor star is characterized by three phases , all of which display significant variability .",
    "the first phase is a wide angle release of mildly to moderately relativistic material , which we call the precursor .",
    "this phase is due to the release of the turbulent shocked material that accumulates around the jet due to vortex shedding before it breaks out of the star ( ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang et al .",
    "this initial phase is followed by a shocked jet phase . in this second phase",
    "the jet material that flows out of the star has been heavily shocked .",
    "the energy flow is highly variable in this phase , and no temporal trend in the properties can be identified . during this phase",
    "the jet is most highly collimated .",
    "finally , as the pressure of the cocoon decreases , the jet settles into a stable configuration with a freely expanding core surrounded by a shocked shear layer at the boundary with the cocoon material . in this phase",
    "the energy flow is almost constant , and the jet opening angle increases logarithmically with time .",
    "this temporal evolution of the jet is also associated with the angular distribution of energy , and therefore determines what different observers see from different directions .",
    "the precursor is characterized by a wide opening angle and can be seen from most directions .",
    "the shocked jet phase is the most concentrated and can be seen only by observers within several degrees of the axis . as a consequence",
    ", such observers will see a very bright event .",
    "observers who lie a few degrees outside the shocked jet cone will see the precursor , followed by a dead time of several tens of seconds .",
    "eventually , when the jet opens to contain their line of sight , they will see a second phase of emission .",
    "these observers will therefore measure dead - times much longer than any timescale of the inner engine , as found in several batse light curves ( lazzati 2005 ) .",
    "the overall angular distribution of energy is complex and does not seem to follow any simple correlation with the jet or progenitor properties . in some cases ,",
    "the jet is characterized by a flat core with a sudden cutoff , very similar to a top - hat jet ( 16tig5 ) , while in other cases the distribution is more centrally peaked .",
    "it seems , however , that our high resolution simulations were not able to reproduce previous analytic or numerical results like the @xmath151 universal jet of lb05 or the @xmath66 distribution found by zhang et al .",
    "such behaviors are observed only in a limited range of angles from the jet axis .",
    "we computed afterglow light curves from our energy distributions showing that differences in the afterglow phase can result from the different properties of the progenitor and/or of the jet in the core of the star .",
    "we also developed further the analytic model of lb05 , refining some approximations to obtain a model that can reproduce such basic features of the simulations as the propagation of the bow shock inside the star and the precursor energy , as well as the qualitative evolution of the jet opening angle .",
    "it is easy to find paths along which this work can be developed further .",
    "higher resolution and dimensionality will certainly be worth exploring ( zhang et al . 2004 ) , as well as the consequences of a more accurate equation of state capable of describing both relativistic and non - relativistic material . including a non - relativistic wind from the accretion disk is also worthwhile , as this seems to be a ubiquitous outcome of jet - launching simulations ( proga et al .",
    "2003 ; de villiers et al .",
    "this wind component may alter the cocoon properties , which are so important in defining the behavior of the precursor and shocked jet phases .",
    "simulations also suggest that the jet luminosity should be highly variable if not intermittent .",
    "preliminary studies ( aloy et al . 2000 ) suggest that this may enhance the propagation of the jet through the star , but higher resolution simulations are required .",
    "an interesting hypothesis is that the three phases of jet propagation will respond differently to an intermittent engine , with the precursor virtually unaffected while the unshocked jet should retain most of the engine variability .",

    "<S> we study the long - term evolution of relativistic jets in collapsars and examine the effects of viewing angle on the subsequent gamma ray bursts . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a series of high - resolution simulations of a jet propagating through a stellar envelope in 2d cylindrical coordinates using the flash relativistic hydrodynamics module . for the first time , simulations are carried out using an adaptive mesh that allows for a large dynamic range inside the star while still being efficient enough to follow the evolution of the jet long after it breaks out from the star . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations allow us to single out three phases in the jet evolution : a precursor phase in which relativistic material turbulently shed from the head of the jet first emerges from the star , a shocked jet phase where a fully shocked jet of material is emerging , and an unshocked jet phase where the jet consists of a free - streaming , unshocked core surrounded by a thin boundary layer of shocked jet material . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of these phases will be different to observers at different angles . </S>",
    "<S> the precursor has a wide opening angle and would be visible far off axis . </S>",
    "<S> the shocked phase has a relatively narrow opening angle that is constant in time . during the unshocked jet phase the opening angle increases logarithmically with time . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> some observers see prolonged dead times of emission even for constant properties of the jet injected in the stellar core . </S>",
    "<S> we also present an analytic model that is able to reproduce the overall properties of the jet and its evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we finally discuss the observational implications of our results , emphasizing the possible ways to test progenitor models through the effects of jet propagation in the star . in an appendix , we present 1d and 2d tests of the flash relativistic hydrodynamics module . </S>"
