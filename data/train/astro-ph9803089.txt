    "the interaction between the magnetic field anchored to rotating bodies and matter orbiting around them plays an important role in a variety of astrophysical situations , ranging from the jupiter - io system ( stern and ness 1982 ) to the jovian ring ( burns 1985 ) , to protoplanetary disks around young magnetic stars ( bodenheimer 1995 ) and accreting degenerate stellar remnants in binary systems , such as white dwarfs in intermediate polars or neutron stars in x - ray binaries ( frank , king and raine 1995 ) .",
    "straightforward applications of the laws of electrodynamics are possible in cases , such as the jovian ring , in which the orbiting matter is made of solid , dust particles . due to a variety of poorly known mhd and plasma effects",
    ", modelling this interaction in the case of gaseous disks that orbit different classes of magnetic stars is far more uncertain and difficult .",
    "in particular , theoretical descriptions of viscous accretion disks around magnetic rotating stars have been largely based on a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "two of these are especially relevant to the present work : ( a ) that the magnetic field ( assumed dipolar ) and rotation axes of the star are coaligned ; ( b ) that the disk is continuous , smooth , azimuthally symmetric and lies in the equatorial plane of the rotating star . for example",
    "ghosh and lamb ( 1979 ) adopted these assumptions and introduced an _",
    "ad hoc _ effective diffusivity of the disk plasma to derive a stationary disk solution , in which the star magnetic field lines thread the disk and slip across its material .",
    "models of this kind proved very useful for evaluating the basic properties of the disk - magnetic field interaction , such as the size of the magnetosphere and the balance of the material and non - material torques .",
    "it has always been recognised that the coalignement of the magnetic field and rotation axes of the star is an unrealistic hypothesis as a finite magnetic colatitude is required for the generation of the periodic signals at the star spin frequency that are often observed in these systems .",
    "on the other hand , the pronounced aperiodic ( or , in some cases , quasi - periodic ) variability that is frequently detected on a variety of timescales ranging from days to milliseconds in disk accreting compact stars of all classes ( intermediate polars : king and lasota 1990 ; accreting neutron stars and black holes : van der klis 1995 , van der klis 1997 ) testify that the disk can not be regarded as smooth , continuous and azimuthally symmetric . in a number of cases the quasi - periodic timing signature of blobs orbiting over a limited range of radii close to the compact star",
    "is clearly seen . a highly inhomogeneous and clumpy disk , possibly comprising two distinct and coexisting phases ( hot and cold ) , is also envisaged as the end product of the instabilities predicted by current models of viscous disks ( e.g the so - called secular and viscous instabilities of radiation - pressure dominated @xmath0-disks , lightman and eardley 1974 , shakura and sunyaev 1976 , or the magnetic amplification and buoyancy of flux tubes in dynamo - driven disks , vishniac and diamond 1992 ) , as discussed by krolik ( 1998 ) .",
    "in all accreting objects endowed with a strong magnetic field , the presence of inhomogeneities and/or blobs that can be regarded as discrete entities suggests that a novel mode of interaction between the compact star and the disk is possible . this occurs because individual blobs are most likely strongly diamagnetic ( see for instance king 1993 , wynn and king 1995 and references therein ) ; when moving through a magnetic field , strong surface currents develop on the blob the main effect of which is the generation of a drag opposite to the component of the blob velocity perpendicular to the field ( drell , foley and ruderman 1965 ) .",
    "the acceleration acting on each blob is thus @xmath1 the drag time ",
    "scale @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the alfvn speed in the magnetic field @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the mass and characteristic radius of the blob . here",
    "@xmath8 is the relative velocity between the blob and a magnetic field line .",
    "it is easy to see ( fig.1 ) that this acceleration has a component along the disk axis which tends to lift the blob off the equatorial plane where it is , at least initially , lying .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study this dynamical interaction , and to show how this alters the conventional view of accretion disks onto magnetized compact stars . in order to bring out the physical meaning of the instability most clearly",
    ", we shall at first idealize these plasma blobs as point masses .",
    "in the next section , it will be shown that this interaction leads to the lifting of blobs off the equatorial plane , at a resonance radius ; the conditions under which this result applies are discussed in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we relax the hypothesis that blobs are point masses , and establish that a variety of effects , all related to the blobs having a finite size , do not modify our results . as the only concrete application of this instability , we discuss in section 5 the generation of modulation of the x  ray flux in low mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) exhibiting millisecond qpos at frequencies comparable to the single  particle lense  thirring ( 1918 ) precession frequency .",
    "the last section summarizes the results .",
    "we begin by considering the motion of individual blobs initially lying on an accretion disk around a magnetized compact object .",
    "the disk plane is @xmath9 , and the magnetic field is a pure dipole with magnetic moment @xmath10 ; at a point located at distance @xmath11 in a direction @xmath12 from the star center , this is @xmath13 .",
    "it is necessary that the dipolar moment not be aligned with the star s rotation axis @xmath14 ; we shall take it to be inclined by an angle @xmath15 , so that its cartesian components , in a non  rotating frame , are @xmath16 we have assumed here that the star rotates around the @xmath14  axis with angular frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the drag force of eq .",
    "1 can then be seen from fig.1 to be oscillating , _",
    "i.e. _ , the acceleration sometimes speeds up , sometimes decelerates the blob on its motion of revolution .",
    "thus the net effect of the drag force , except at resonances to be identified in the following , is null : the overall structure of the accretion disk is not changed by this effect .",
    "we assume here that the magnetic field is exclusively due to the accreting object , neglecting the field distortion due to the disk , discussed by ghosh and lamb ( 1979 ) .",
    "we can easily see fom fig .",
    "1 that inclusion of a @xmath18 component , which is parallel to the disk velocity , would leave the component of the disk velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field unaffected ; thus the acceleration described in eq .",
    "1 would still have a component in the direction perpendicular to the disk plane , leaving the analysis in the following , which will neglect @xmath18 , unaltered .",
    "we now idealize blobs as test particles , subject , beyond the usual gravitational force , to the drag of eq .",
    "1 and to the usual viscous force @xmath19 . the equations of motion for each blob are then @xmath20 where of course the blob speed perpendicular to the magnetic field is @xmath21 and the relative velocity for circular orbits ( the only ones we shall be interested in , in the following ) is given by @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the keplerian velocity , and @xmath24 a unit vector in the azimuthal direction .",
    "we now assume that the usual viscous timescale @xmath25 is long , and the keplerian period of rotation @xmath26 around the compact object short , compared to the drag time  scale , eq .",
    "2 . in other words",
    ", we shall assume the ordering @xmath27 the validity of this assumption will be discussed later , because it does not hold everywhere , but it will be shown to hold around the resonance radius which will be identified shortly .",
    "it should be noticed that the above ordering is that adopted by king ( 1993 ) .",
    "because of this ordering , we shall neglect normal viscosity henceforth , and use the small parameter @xmath28 to perform a first  order expansion .",
    "in other words , we shall treat the motion as pure rotation in the equatorial plane ( @xmath9 ) to order zero , and treat the off ",
    "plane motions as first  order perturbations .",
    "then the drag force in eq .",
    "1 , which is much smaller than the gravitational force because we assumed @xmath29 , will force motions in the @xmath14  direction .",
    "the linearized equation of motion in the @xmath14  direction is then ( binney and tremaine 1987 ) @xmath30 and in computing the term @xmath31 we use @xmath32 and @xmath11 constant . here",
    "@xmath33 is the ( soon to be discarded ) phase of the orbital motion of the given blob .    with straightforward computations we find @xmath34 @xmath35 and then @xmath36 + 1}{r^6 } \\mu_0 ^ 2\\ ] ] @xmath37 } { 1 + 3\\sin^2\\beta \\sin^2[(\\omega_k-\\omega_s)t+\\phi]}\\;.\\ ] ] the equation of motion , eq .",

[ bsquared ] that the term @xmath2 is modulated at the frequency @xmath39 $ ] , exactly like the denominator of the right  hand side of eq .",
    "[ eqmotion2 ] . by suitably redefining the initial time we can drop the phase @xmath33 .",
    "thus we see that the linearized equation of motion along the star spin axis @xmath14 is that of a free oscillator plus a forcing modulated at the angular frequency @xmath40 , which makes perfect sense once we move to a non  inertial reference frame rotating with the blob . also , it is necessary that the rotator be not ",
    "aligned , otherwise ( @xmath41 ) the right  hand side of eq .",
    "[ eqmotion2 ] will vanish .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this effect vanishes also for perpendicular rotators ( @xmath42 ) because in that case the blob acceleration is always in the equatorial plane .",
    "the right  hand ",
    "side @xmath43 of eq .",
    "[ eqmotion2 ] can then be expanded as @xmath44 f_0 ( \\sin^2[\\omega_k-\\omega_s)t ] ) =   \\sigma_n a_n \\cos[(2n+1)(\\omega_k-\\omega_s)t ] \\;.\\ ] ] clearly , there is a resonance whenever @xmath45 , at corotation .",
    "however , the corotation resonance is irrelevant : in fact , the term @xmath46 in eq .",
    "[ eqmotion2 ] vanishes at this resonance , showing that there is no forcing .",
    "this is reasonable : if there is no relative motion between the blob and the magnetic field lines , the motional electric field @xmath47 vanishes , and there will be no induced currents on the surface of the blob .",
    "then the blob - field interaction is reduced to the usual , much weaker coupling of diamagnetic substances with the gradients of the field .",
    "we shall thus neglect the corotation resonance @xmath48 henceforth .",
    "the other resonances occur for @xmath49 , @xmath50 the upper branch corresponding to inner ( with respect to corotation ) resonances , the lower one to outer resonances .",
    "all of these resonances are included inside a thin radial annulus defined by @xmath51 these resonances are often called secular : a free oscillator with natural angular frequency @xmath52 is forced with the same period .",
    "this is the sought  after resonance condition . when it is satisfied , the forcing is in step with the free oscillation : it is upward when the restoring force is upward , and downward when the restoring force is downward , so that the total effect adds up , and is not averaged out .",
    "it should be noticed that all resonance conditions do not depend on the exact value of @xmath2 , provided it is modulated through @xmath53 ( eq . [ bsquared ] ) only .",
    "analysis of the motion in the equatorial plane adds no new resonance : the forcing @xmath54 is again provided by a term like @xmath43 in eq .",
    "[ h ] , and the equations of motion for the small displacements are of the form @xmath55 , where however the epicyclic frequency @xmath56 , for a @xmath57 potential , equals the keplerian angular frequency @xmath58 ( binney and tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "so , motion in the plane shows exactly the same resonances as motion off the plane .",
    "the significance of these resonances is that they will induce strong epicyclic motions around their unperturbed , circular orbits . since however in a @xmath57 potential all orbits must close , the circular orbits become , after the perturbation , ellipses .",
    "if the total number of blobs is small , they will be unlikely to collide ; if on the other hand , and contrary to evidence from qpo observations , the total number is large , shocks will develop and the problem will not be treatable in the point mass approximation used here .      the relative strengths of higher  order multipoles in the expansion of compact stars magnetic field are virtually unknown .",
    "for application to objects where the accretion disk is thought to extend to within a few stellar radii , ( , kilo  hertz qpo sources ) , the quadrupolar component may be a substantial fraction of the overall field .",
    "it seems thus interesting to consider also the case where the field is entirely due to a quadrupole .",
    "we show here that it produces no new resonances .",
    "we consider a quadrupolar magnetic field , with a symmetry axis which we take as the @xmath59  axis , and again we take this axis to be inclined with respect to the star spin axis @xmath14 .",
    "the more general case of a quadrupole magnetic field with no symmetry axis can be obtained by a suitable superposition of two quadrupolar fields with distinct symmetry axes . since in the following analysis",
    "the @xmath59  axis is definite but otherwise arbitrary , the general case introduces no new element , and the conclusion that no new resonance is present , holds in this case as well .",
    "the magnetic field is then @xmath60 here @xmath61 is eigenvalue of the tensor quadrupole moment along the symmetry axis .",
    "the reference system @xmath62 in which the quadrupole magnetic field has the form shown above is carried around the star axis by its rotation ( fig .",
    "we call @xmath63 the inertial system of reference in which the stellar axis of rotation is called @xmath14 , and the @xmath64 and @xmath65 axes lie in the equatorial plane . in order to determine the rotation matrix @xmath66 which transforms vector components from the @xmath62 to the @xmath63 system of reference",
    ", we proceed as follows . calling @xmath15 the angle between the @xmath59 and @xmath14 axes , the components of the @xmath59 axis in the @xmath63 frame are @xmath67",
    "since the quadrupole field is symmetric about the @xmath59  axis , we can choose the @xmath68  axis to lie in the @xmath69  plane ; then , because it must satisfy the conditions @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , we find @xmath72 then the @xmath73  axis is given by the cross ",

    "the magnetic field ( eq . [ quadrupole ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath78 and , by acting upon the first term , the rotation matrix still returns a vector directed along @xmath79 . since we need to evaluate the forcing term ( eq . [ projection ] ) for the unperturbed orbit",
    "for which @xmath80 , we see that the first term on the right  hand  side of the above equation disappears from both the term @xmath81 and from the term @xmath82 , so that , except for the term @xmath53 in eq .",

    "[ minor ] , which again can be neglected for the same reasons discussed in the previous section , and the other resonances given by @xmath49 , again identical to the previous section .",
    "since we treated the problem in the linear regime , the sum of the dipole and quadrupole fields also shows the same resonances .",
    "once again , motion in the equatorial plane adds nothing new .",
    "we can not compute an accurate value for @xmath2 , for several reasons .",
    "first , we are not even close to knowing the blobs properties ( but see the next section ) so that the quantity @xmath93 which appears in eq .",
    "2 ( , the blobs typical surface density ) is basically unknown .",
    "we shall take @xmath94 , with @xmath95 the unperturbed disk s surface density at the same radius , and expect @xmath96 , because blobs must form from the contraction of disk material .",
    "second , when blobs form , the interblob space is filled with tenuous gas of unknown density , which clearly makes @xmath4 larger than it would be should there be no blobs .",
    "thus , in order to establish the second half @xmath97 of the ordering in eq .",
    "[ ordering ] , we take for @xmath4 the speed of light @xmath98 .",
    "we now have @xmath99    the unperturbed disk s viscous inflow time ",
    "scale @xmath100 .",
    "we shall use this unperturbed value , despite the fact that this is most likely a lower limit to the time ",
    "scale , because , if many large blobs form , the interblob disk will be filled with lower density gas , which obviously exerts a weaker viscous drag on the blobs . using the definition of alfvn radius ( shapiro and teukolsky 1983 ) , and the fact that the magnetic field is dipolar @xmath101 , we obtain @xmath102 we find that @xmath103 provided @xmath104 . here",
    "@xmath105 is the shakura ",
    "sunyaev adimensional viscosity parameter .",
    "despite several serious uncertainties , it appears the key assumption @xmath106 must hold at least in the case of relatively small values of @xmath0 .",
    "we feel we can not usefully speculate more about the value of @xmath107 .    in order to establish the second half of the ordering , @xmath29",
    ", we take a lower limit to @xmath2 , by using all quantities as if the disk were totally unperturbed . in the innermost , radiation  pressure dominated region of accretion disks ( region a of shakura and sunyaev 1973 ) , we obtain @xmath108 where @xmath6 is the mass of the accreting object in solar units and @xmath109 the accretion rate in units of @xmath110 . in region",
    "b the inequality @xmath111 is always satisfied . here",
    "@xmath112 is the star radius ; since typcally @xmath113 , the lower limit being dictated by the millisecond qpos of some accreting neutron stars , the ordering @xmath114 is satisfied .",
    "the further condition , that the blob stays on the resonance long enough for significant energy transfer to occur , before the viscosity pushes it inward and away from the resonance , is satisfied provided @xmath97 , and thus no distinct requirement is added .",
    "the requirement that the outermost resonance exists is of course that the alfvn radius occurs inside the resonance radius , or , equivalently , that the magnetic star is a sufficiently slow rotator ( ghosh and lamb 1979 ) . calling @xmath115 the keplerian angular velocity of matter at the alfvn radius ,",
    "this condition is @xmath116 .",
    "this is less stringent than the usual condition @xmath117 , which implies that matter that becomes attached to the stellar magnetic field lines does not get flung out by the propeller effect ( illarionov and sunyaev 1975 ) .",
    "in the previous sections we gave a highly idealized account of the resonance mechanism . this was done partly to obtain a tractable problem , and partly to bring out clearly the meaning of the instability . in this section",
    "we reintroduce some of the complications that were left out , in particular random magnetic fields , buoyancy , radiation pressure and blob heating .",
    "all of these effects will be negligible in the limit of very small blob size ; while this is quite clear for buoyancy , radiation pressure and heating , it is less so in the case of random magnetic field .",
    "so we first discuss this last point , then turn to the others to deduce upper limits to the blob size .",
    "it is convenient to introduce for blobs an ` equivalent length ' @xmath118 , distinct from the physical length @xmath7 , and defined as @xmath119 @xmath120 is essentially the factor of contraction of the blob material , and @xmath121 the density contrast with respect to the surroundings .      from the discussion in the section 2",
    ", it seems likely that , as long as the magnetic field is an ordered one , the structure of the resonances is the one described in eq .",
    "[ resonance ] .",
    "however , outside the magnetosphere , the magnetic field is likely to have also a chaotic component , the main sources of which are all the irregularities of the disk , foremost among which are the very blobs we discussed .",
    "in fact , the diamagnetic blobs have surface currents which themselves generate a magnetic field . as seen from one of the blobs",
    ", the total magnetic field will thus be chaotic , with a fourier spectrum ( with respect to time ) strongly peaked around the frequency @xmath122 .",
    "the reason is that the magnetic field will appear as the incoherent superposition of randomly oriented magnetic moments ( corresponding to the independent blobs ) , and since dipole magnetic fields scale with distance from the magnetic moment as @xmath123 , the local magnetic field will be strongly dominated by the nearby blobs , which nearly corotate with the blob we are considering , leading to a spectrum strongly peaked around @xmath122 .",
    "the cut  off frequency @xmath124 at which the chaotic magnetic field power spectrum starts to decrease is difficult to estimate .",
    "it is clearly of order @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is the keplerian frequency at the radius @xmath11 under consideration , and @xmath127 is the keplerian frequency at the radius @xmath128 such that the total number of blobs in a circle centered on @xmath11 and of radius @xmath129 is a few . beyond this radius , and thus this frequency difference ,",
    "the magnetic moments begin to add incoherently and thus to cancel each other .",
    "however , due to our ignorance of blobs properties , including number and distribution , we are unable to estimate @xmath124 .    despite the near  cancellation of the many , distant and incoherent moments , a small residual field ( the ` square root effect ' ) will survive at all frequencies , but its dynamical effect at frequencies different from the kepler frequency is negligible : we showed in fact that these components of the magnetic field cause oscillating forces out of step with the natural oscillation frequency , and thus a null average effect .",
    "only the component of the chaotic field at the oscillation frequency could be important .",
    "consider then a chaotic magnetic field @xmath130 with ( time ) fourier spectrum @xmath131 , as seen by the orbiting blob ; if the resonance width is @xmath132 , then the relevant component of the chaotic magnetic field is given by @xmath133 .",
    "the condition under which the analysis of the previous section applies is then @xmath134 where @xmath135 represents the ordered magnetic field .",
    "this is much less restrictive than the naive condition @xmath136 , for two reasons .",
    "first , as discussed above , most of the power of the chaotic magnetic field will be concentrated around zero frequency , so that @xmath137 , and second , for blob of angular size @xmath138 , @xmath139 . in the next subsection",
    "we shall establish a quantitative upper limit to the small  scale chaotic magnetic field in a restricted but important subclass of accretors .      while the analysis of the previous paragraph holds for all accretors , in this specific class of accretors ( van der klis 1997 ) a stronger argument",
    "can be made which rules out the importance of chaotic magnetic fields .",
    "the energy density of the neutron star magnetic field at a given radius can be compared to the local , internal energy density @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the disk average density , @xmath142 boltzmann s constant , and @xmath143 the proton mass .",
    "in fact , since the local magnetic field must be generated at the expense of the disk s internal energy , this provides an absolute upper limit to the chaotic field energy density .    the dipole ( @xmath144 ) energy density at radius @xmath11 can be rewritten as @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath147 are the disk density and rotational velocity at the alfvn radius , @xmath148 .",
    "this is because , by definition , the magnetic and rotational energy densities are roughly matched there .",
    "on the other hand , the chaotic field @xmath130 energy density obeys @xmath149 and this can be rewritten , taking into account the fact that , in the case of such fast and low  magnetic field accretors",
    "the alfvn radius surely falls into region a of the accretion disk ( shakura and sunyaev 1973 ) , as @xmath150 taking the ratio of eq .",
    "[ dipoledensity ] and [ better ] we find @xmath151 and again using the expressions for region a we find @xmath152 where we used the frequency at the afvn radius @xmath153 to eliminate the alfvn radius from the above expression .",

    "[ aux ] and in terms of keplerian frequencies ; defining @xmath154 as the frequency where the magnetic energy densitites are equal , we find @xmath155 in neutron stars exhibiting millisecond qpos , we have @xmath156 and the pulsar spin frequency @xmath157 ( van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "the outermost resonance ( @xmath158 , eq . [ resonance ] ) occurs for @xmath159 for these values .",
    "thus the dipole magnetic field exceeds the internal energy density of the disk for all radii for which the keplerian frequency exceeds @xmath160 , and this includes in particular the whole resonance strip , eq .",
    "[ resonance ] , especially when one remembers that this is an upper limit to the chaotic magnetic field , and the arguments of the previous paragraph .",
    "the above analysis would be flawed only in the case in which the energy density of the chaotic magnetic field were in rough equipartition with the energy density of the radiation , which dominates the energy balance in region a. however , this seems somewhat less likely , given that proccesses leading to field amplification ( shearing , compression , turbulent dynamo ) couple the magnetic field preferentially to the matter .",
    "buoyancy tends to reduce the restoring force , in our case gravity .",
    "calling @xmath161 and the @xmath141 the densities of the blob and of the disk ( this is a local quantity ) , buoyancy reduces the local gravitational acceleration by the factor @xmath162 ; it enters our eq .",
    "[ eqnmotion ] by reducing the square of the kepler frequency by the same factor . by neglecting buoyancy ,",
    "we have essentially assumed @xmath163 , which implies that the correction factor @xmath164 , so we acted consistently with our approximation of point  mass blobs .",
    "when the density contrast of the blobs becomes small , the restoring force is greatly weakened , the restoring period ( previously @xmath165 , now @xmath166 ) will exceed @xmath2 , and the approximations leading to eq .",
    "[ eqnmotion ] will fail : in this case no resonance is possible , because the restoring period is pushed to infinity .",
    "but then , the condition of applicability of our analysis is that the density contrast @xmath167 , @xmath168 , roughly as determined at the end of section [ zumpa ] .",
    "realistic blobs will be subject to severe shear stresses due to differential rotation , which will elongate them in the azimuthal direction",
    ". however , the final consequences of this shear are not very important .",
    "in fact , the number of orbital revolutions that the blobs can execute before differential rotation smears them over , say , an azimuth of 1 radian ( , before axial symmetry is restored ) is given by @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the variation of the kepler frequency across the blob ; using our hunch that typical blobs sizes are @xmath171 , the disk semi ",
    "thickness , we find @xmath172 . in particular , in region a of viscous accretions disks ( shakura and sunyaev 1973 ) , where the semi  thickness is given by ( neglecting the disk tapering at its inner edge ) @xmath173 we obtain @xmath174 during the stretching , blobs evolve at roughly constant volume ( and hence constant density ) , otherwise the declining internal pressure would be overcome by the outer , confining pressure .",
    "thus stresses generate a filament which will still be subject to the magnetic drag instability discussed here .    in the following section [ lt ]",
    ", we shall apply this instability to the generation of lense  thirring precession around atoll sources exhibiting millisecond qpos . here",
    ", the blob lifetime @xmath175 has a lower limit given by the observed width of the line due to lt  precession ( @xmath176 , stella and vietri 1998 ) , which is to be compared with the kepler frequency at the same radius , @xmath177 .",
    "we have @xmath178 , consistent with the estimate of eq .",
    "[ lifetime ] .",
    "what this amounts to is that we should see our picture as applied to a bead of blobs rather than a single one , an inessential modification .",
    "thus shear stresses are unimportant , provided of course fresh , tiny blobs ( @xmath179 ) are injected continuously at the resonances .",
    "once the blobs are lifted by the instability off the disk , they will exit the disk shadow and be exposed to radiation pressure from the accreting source . clearly , if the radiation from the compact object is beamed , this force will be pulsed at frequency @xmath40 , but it will also have a non  zero average : radiation pressure is outward .",
    "if this force on the blobs exceeds the magnetic drag ( either in or out of the plane ) , our previous analysis will fail .",
    "the importance of radiation pressure is of course dependent upon the nature of the sources , being larger in neutron stars than in white dwarfs , and in particular in z  type lmxbs more than in atoll sources .",
    "we consider an accretor with luminosity @xmath180 a fraction @xmath181 of eddington s ( @xmath182 , with @xmath183 ) .",
    "the radiation force is @xmath184 , and the gravitational force @xmath185 with @xmath186 the mass of the accretor and @xmath187 the blob mass ; the ratio @xmath188 between the two is @xmath189 and , using the definition of @xmath190 , and our expectation that the blobs will have typical sizes of order @xmath179 , the disk semi ",
    "thickness , @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the thomson cross  section , and @xmath193 is the optical depth to thomson scattering of the blob .",
    "since we took blobs to be at least a few times denser than the disk at the same location , the optical depth of the blob is a few times that of the disk in the direction perpendicular to the plane . in conventional viscous accretion disks",
    "@xmath193 is a monotonically increasing function of radius ; thus , by considering z  type sources ( which are , together with atoll sources , the fastest rotators , but have luminosities larger by about a factor of 100 ) we are putting ourselves into the worst case .",
    "even then , @xmath194 at the radii corresponding to eq .",
    "[ resonance ] , so that we find at those radii @xmath195 thus we have established that , at such large radii , radiation pressure is negligible in z  type sources and , _ a fortiori _ , in atoll sources for which @xmath196 .",
    "this conclusion is further strengthened by the remark that in the above we assumed the luminosity to be spherically symmetric , while , if we assume some beaming as is most natural in spinning neutron stars , the relevant luminosity to be used above is smaller than the value employed . also , the conclusion holds also for @xmath15disks ( stella and rosner 1984 ) .      a more subtle effect , the removal of angular momentum from an orbiting object , is discussed by miller and lamb ( 1993 , 1996 ) , and more recently by miller ( 1998 ) .",
    "this is an interesting effect which , when coupled with the excitation mechanism discussed here , might lead to blobs precession around the neutron star .",
    "we discuss here two objections to miller s ( 1998 ) computations , one applying in the case in which blobs are evaporated quickly by the neutron star luminosity , the other one in the opposite limit of no evaporation .",
    "taken together , these two arguments show that the importance of angular momentum removal by radiation pressure forces is still too rough to be of great cogency .",
    "the importance of evaporative effects depends in a sensitive way upon such unknown quantities as the blobs cross  section to the neutron star , its chemical composition , conduction and its inhibition by small  scale tangled magnetic fields , and so on .",
    "so we shall simply consider the implications of two limiting cases , quick or slow evaporation , without consideration of which one actually holds .    in the case of quick evaporation ,",
    "a diffuse layer of matter will be produced by the evaporation of the first blobs to be lifted off the disk , in which following blobs will be protected from sunburns .",
    "the physical conditions of this layer remind us of the so  called hot inner disk corona ( boyle , fabian and guilbert 1986 , and especially kallman and white 1989 ) .",
    "thus , this may be thought of as one of the mechanisms providing the material of the corona , with the process continuing until saturation : when the hot corona becomes so optically thick in the radial direction to shield new blobs , it stops accreting new matter , in a self  regulating way .",
    "it should furthermore be remarked that the fact that the hot disk corona is optically thick in the radial direction by no means implies that it is optically thick also in the direction perpendicular to the disk .",
    "thus the resulting optical depth along a random line of sight may very well be smaller than @xmath197 , thus leaving observational properties unaffected . also , the hot disk corona forms in rough pressure equilibrium with the disk , ensuring the pressure confinement of the blobs .    in the opposite limit , in which we totally neglect evaporation",
    ", the following argument shows that the computations by miller ( 1998 ) are not relevant to the problem at hand .",
    "the width of the khz qpo peak ( @xmath198 ) indicates a blob lifetime of at least @xmath199 and a radial extent of @xmath200 or less ( cf .",
    "miller , lamb and psaltis 1998 ) , in agreement with our hunch that a typical blob raidus equals the disk thickness , eq .",
    "if the rms amplitude of the qpos , often in the few percent range , is indicative of the gravitational energy released by the blobs , then at least some @xmath201 are produced by the blobs in an atoll lmxrb at any time .",
    "for the khz qpo signal not to be smeared by the superposition of signals from different blobs with different phases , the number of blobs that are active at any time must be limited to , say , @xmath202 . for an energy conversion efficiency of 0.1 , the numbers above convert to a blob mass of @xmath203 and a ( radial ) thomson depth , @xmath204 , in the @xmath205 range .",
    "the radiation drag discussed by miller ( 1998 ) operates only within a few optical depths ( say 3 ) , such that only the blob outer layers facing the neutron star are affected by radiation drag at any time .",
    "this results in a gradual ablation of the blob , on a timescale of @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the azimuthal extent of the blob and @xmath208 the change of angular velocity caused by radiation drag ( cf .",
    "miller 1998 ) .",
    "this radiation drag timescale is far longer than the blob lifetime estimated from the qpo peak widths .",
    "we therefore conclude , at variance with miller ( 1998 ) , that the motion of the blobs ( including their lense - thirring precession ) is virtually unaffected by radiation drag , even in the case in which there is no accretion disk corona that shields the blobs from the neutron star radiation .",
    "a finite size may have another interesting consequence : blobs may straddle several resonances simultaneously , especially close to corotation which , according to eq .",
    "[ resonanceall ] , is an accumulation point of resonances .",
    "it is not clear what will happen to the blobs in that case , because the forces which assure the blob cohesion , namely pressure confinement and especially the large internal viscous stresses , may well overcome the forcing due to several , out of phase resonances .",
    "it seems indeed more likely that only the two extreme resonances , @xmath158 and @xmath209 may be capable of lifting blobs off the equatorial plane .",
    "the reason for this is that , in a @xmath57 potential the radial separation @xmath210 of resonances obeys @xmath211 only for these two , outermost resonances .",
    "then , since we showed that the condition for the correctness of the analysis in the previous sections is @xmath168 , we deduce that only these two resonances are sure to be effective .",
    "more resonances may be active in the more extreme case @xmath212 .",
    "it should also be stated that we do not expect this instability to clear out the disk at resonances , because the diffuse component of the disk will not be subject to the magnetic drag , and will continue to accrete onto the central object as if unperturbed .",
    "one of the side  effects of the motion of the blobs with respect to the average , diffuse disk matter is the appearance of the ever  present , ever ",
    "destructive kelvin  helmholtz instability ( @xmath213 khi ) . however , its development is surely slow compared to the development of the instability considered here .",
    "the reason is that the khi growth rate @xmath214 is @xmath215 here @xmath216 is the off  plane velocity induced by the magnetic drag force , and as usual we suppose @xmath179 .",
    "however the growth rate for the instability discussed in this paper is @xmath217 , which exceeds @xmath214 by the factor @xmath218 by assumption .",
    "when the blob is lifted off the equatorial plane , it will presumably find itself into an even more tenuous medium , and the khi will slow down further still .",
    "furthermore , the khi can be tamed in a suitably radiative medium ( vietri , ferrara and miniati 1997 ) , so that it seems at least likely that it will not be a major source of destruction for the blobs .",
    "this section is well  summarized then by stating that all of the limiting factors discussed here are negligible , provided the density contrast of blobs orbiting a generic accretor exceeds unity , @xmath219 , or , equivalently , @xmath168 .",
    "dishomogeneities in the accretion flow may arise as a consequence of either disk  specific instabilities ( lightman and eardley 1974 , shakura and sunyaev 1976 , vishniac and diamond 1992 ) , or of the more conventional thermal instability ( field 1965 ) . until now",
    ", theoretical studies have not concentrated on the possible non  linear fate of local instabilities ( while there is an extensive literature on the non  linear development of collective instabilities ) and , as a consequence , no credible estimates of either linear size or masses exist to date in the literature .",
    "the only remark we can make is that lack of theoretical arguments is not lack of dishomogeneities , as testified by the panoply of qpos being discovered in a wide variety of accreting sources ( intermediate polars : king and lasota 1990 ; accreting neutron stars and black holes : van der klis 1995 , van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "this wide variety points to the existence of a robust mechanism leading to the formation of blobs , irrespective of the nature of the accreting source .",
    "it is also clear that in the subsequent , non  linear development of this instability , hydrodynamical as well as dynamical effects will play significant roles . in particular , important effects which may be expected to play a role",
    "are a drag by the disk material on the blobs as they plunge through the accretion disk , the possible formation of shocks if the vertical speeds exceed the local sound speed as may well be expected to be the case , or the excitation of spiral waves in the disk surface density distribution .",
    "hydrodynamic phenomena will limit the growth of the instability discussed in this paper , but the important question of whether they manage to do so before individual blobs are lifted off the plane will need to be settled through full numerical simulations which lie outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we have until now , avoided the question of which , if any , obsevational consequences may arise from the proposed instability .",
    "the most remarkable one is , most likely , the low ",
    "frequency modulation of the x  ray flux from the compact object around which the blobs are orbiting , with frequencies of order of the single  particle lense  thirring ( @xmath220 ) precession frequency .",
    "lense  thirring precession ( lense and thirring 1918 ) by point masses around compact , rotating objects in general relativity is a slow precession of the orbital plane induced by the compact object rotation , which can occur provided the point mass does not lie in the rotating object s equatorial plane .",
    "we showed ( stella and vietri 1998 ) that the peak frequencies of some spectral features in low mass x ",
    "ray binaries exhibiting millisecond qpos are well  explained by the frequencies of lense  thirring precession , including their variation with source intensity .",
    "this effect may arise as follows .",
    "if the accretion disks around these sources are indeed blobby , the blobs are lifted off the neutron star equatorial plane by the instability discussed here , and then they lt ",
    "precess at the single  particle precession frequency .",
    "as discussed above , we believe radiation pressure forces to be negligible .",
    "then , if the blobs are self  luminous , or if they occult the emitting areas on the surface of the neutron star , the resulting x  ray flux will be modulated also at the single  particle lt frequency . alternatively , the blobs may punch holes in the accretion disks at the two points where the inclined blob orbit intersects the disk . in this case , the x  ray flux from the accreting disk itself will be modulated at twice the single  particle precession frequency .",
    "lense  thirring precession of material from viscous accretion disks has been until now discounted because a large body of literature ( bardeen and petterson 1975 , hatchett , begelman and sarazin 1981 , papaloizou and pringle 1983 ) has shown that viscosity manages to bring the disk material to the neutron star equatorial plane , even if it lies initially in a plane tilted with respect to it .",
    "we accept these conclusions , but wish to show what follows : that the time  scale for viscous damping of off  plane motions in the disks * innermost * regions is long compared to the time ",
    "scale on which lt ",
    "precession is forced .",
    "we would like to do this for a reasonable value of the viscosity , but since we are unable to specify which fraction of the disk material is in blobs and which is in the tenuous interblob medium , we do not know the viscosity .",
    "thus we shall assume that in the z  direction viscosity is as large as in the tangential direction ( an upper limit ) , and furthermore that the viscosity of the unperturbed shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) models holds ( another upper limit ) .",
    "so the conclusion that viscosity is unable , at small radii , to damp lt ",
    "precession holds _ a fortiori _ for blobs in a realistic medium .",
    "the above argument can also be stated otherwise .",
    "we shall show that the reason why viscosity is so effective at damping lt ",
    "precession is that it does so at large radii , where viscous time ",
    "scales are much shorter than lt  ones ; where the opposite is true , , at small radii , the only reason why the viscous accretion disk lies in the equatorial plane is that the material it is made of was obliged to lie down at large radii . should any perturbing agent , such as the one discussed in this paper , lift material off the equatorial plane , then at small radii we can not count on viscosity to make the disk ( and thus also the blobs ) lie down once again .",
    "we consider a tilted , warped disk , split into azimuthally symmetric , coplanar ringlets each identified by a local normal unit vector @xmath221 which , for small tilt angles , can be written as @xmath222 with @xmath15 the tilt and @xmath223 the twist .",
    "it is convenient , following hatchett , begelman and sarazin ( 1981 ) , to introduce the complex quantity @xmath224 which obeys the equation ( papaloizou and pringle 1983 ) @xmath225 the right  hand  side is a diffusive term which describes the damping by viscosity , while the rightmost term on the left  hand  side describes the forcing due to the lt  precession .",
    "here @xmath226 , @xmath127 and @xmath227 , are the radial velocity and @xmath228 and @xmath229 kinematic viscosities in the unperturbed disk . the lense  thirring precession , due to a compact object of mass @xmath186 and angular momentum @xmath230 , acts on a timescale @xmath231 , where @xmath232    we want to compare @xmath233 with the timescale @xmath25 on which viscosity leads to a damping of the tilt .",
    "we thus approximate the viscosity ",
    "induced diffusive term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ master ] as @xmath234 from which we find @xmath235    next we derive the adimensional ratio @xmath236    a useful modification to the theory given by papaloizou and pringle ( 1983 ) has been introduced by markovi and lamb ( 1998 ) , who generalized the above equation to the case of non  isothermal disks ; we shall follow here their treatment .",
    "they write the @xmath229 viscosity as @xmath237 , where @xmath127 is the @xmath228 viscosity ; they write , for a disk with a power  law temperature profile given by @xmath238 , as @xmath239 introducing this into eq .",
    "[ ratio ] , we find @xmath240 with @xmath241 given by @xmath242    the above equation explains why all previous authors were so successful in making the disk lie in the neutron star equatorial plane : the above ratio tends to @xmath243 at large radii , where the viscosity is much more effective than lt  forcing .",
    "thus disks are made to lie down at large radii .",
    "once the disk material reaches the innermost regions , it already lies in the equatorial plane , so that noone will notice that viscosity may not be effective any longer .",
    "in particular , this argument explains why we believe the criticisms of lense  thirring precession in lmxbs ( stella and vietri 1998 ) discussed by markovi and lamb ( 1998 ) are not cogent .",
    "when seeking _ global _ modes , one finds very large damping rates because the _ global _ mode must drag around ringlets at large radii which are powerfully braked down , because there @xmath244 , as we now show .",
    "markovi and lamb ( 1998 ) eventually decide to consider an isothermal disk for which @xmath245 .",
    "we then also consider the values they adopt , @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 , and a @xmath251 accretor . from this",
    "we deduce @xmath252 . at the same time",
    ", they take an outer radius given by @xmath253 , where @xmath254 , and @xmath255 is their adopted radiative efficiency . in physical units , this outer radius is @xmath256 . inserting the values",
    "just deduced for @xmath241 and @xmath257 into eq .",
    "[ ratio3 ] we find @xmath258 : as we guessed , their computation yields large damping rates because at their large outer radii damping by viscosity is much more effective than lense  thirring forcing . nor",
    "will it do to seek higher order modes , which have more maxima and minima : we see in fact from the right  hand  side of eq .",
    "[ master ] that this makes the dissipative term even larger , thus enhancing further still its efficiency through the whole radial range .",
    "a more relevant computation , neglecting the clumpy nature of the accretion disk but still more realistic than the global modes discussed above , would involve the time ",
    "dependent evolution of a small disk , with an inner free edge and an outer edge at small radius being held at fixed misalignment , thusly simulating the instability that we find in this paper .",
    "this will be presented elsewhere .",
    "at small radii we find that @xmath259 .",
    "it is convenient to establish this for a realistic temperature structure .",
    "since we are interested in the innermost disk regions , we shall adopt the temperature structure of region a ( shakura and sunyaev 1973 ) , @xmath260 where @xmath261 . from eq .",
    "we then find @xmath262 it is obvious that @xmath241 falls outside region a ; we thus have the important result , using eq . [ ratio3 ] , that through the whole region a viscosity acts on a slower time ",
    "scale than lt  forcing .",
    "when this occurs , then any perturbing agent will be able to excite off ",
    "plane motions , and the viscosity will be unable to damp the motions .",
    "this bears out our contention ( stella and vietri 1998 ) that in both atoll and z  type sources , if material is excited out of the equatorial plane at small radii , then viscosity will be unable to force it back down , even for the very large assumed viscosity .",
    "thus _ any _ excitation acting at small radii , not just the one discussed here , will be able to induce off - plane motions .",
    "this is the reason why work purporting to show that lt ",
    "precession is unlikely to occur around compact objects is irrelevant to our aims : we do not expect that the tilt off the neutron star equatorial plane is generated at large radii , as was assumed in all previous works , but rather we showed that it can be excited at small radii where it will not be damped .",
    "the processes described above are generic : they apply to every accretion disk broken up into discrete units , surrounding a magnetized non  aligned rotator provided the ordering of time",
    " scales ( eq . [ ordering ] ) holds and the blobs have density contrasts @xmath263 .",
    "the instability is independent of the detailed diamagnetic properties of the blobs ( here enshrined in the parameter @xmath2 which is just modulated at the relative frequency @xmath40 ) , of their masses and densities , their interactions with radiation emitted by the accreting source , and the exact form of the viscosity .",
    "provided the hierarchy of timescales @xmath264 ( eq . [ ordering ] ) is established and blobs have non  negligible density contrasts , it should apply to both accreting white dwarfs and neutron stars .",
    "the existence of resonances is essentially due to the fact that a spatially periodic magnetic field , such as that due to a single multipole , will produce a temporally",
    " variable electromagnetic force on a single blob , as it passes through the various frequency components of the field .",
    "minor corrections to the exact locations of the resonances might derive from effects we opted not to consider , such as an axially offset field , or a rotation rate different for different multipoles , as it happens to the non  dipolar part of the magnetic field of the earth .",
    "another phenomenon we neglected to investigate , and which might generate further resonances , is the non  linear coupling of radial , latitudinal and longitudinal motions .",
    "it should however be borne in mind that the exact locations of resonances might be irrelevant since blobs are expected to have a finite size .",
    "the evolution of the accretion disk after the resonance of eq . [ resonance ] is very difficult to predict ; it seems clear enough that blobs will tend to move closer to the magnetic equatorial plane , and oscillate around it , but the further evolution is uncertain because the details depend on a very poorly known quantity , the @xmath14axis viscosity .",
    "this is the reason why we did not push the analysis performed in this paper into the non  linear regime .",
    "it seems quite clear that the disk must puff  up , but whether , and when , viscosity will manage to bring it back to the equatorial plane remains an open question .",
    "very interesting consequences of the above  discussed instability occur in a specific class of accretors , neutron stars exhibiting millisecond qpos .",
    "blobs that have acquired @xmath14  axis motions will be acted upon by the torque which causes lense  thirring ( 1918 , lt ) precession .",
    "we have shown here that , in both atoll and z  type sources , viscosity is surely unable to bring blobs back down to the equatorial plane . for motions in the plane ,",
    "the net effect of the instability is to induce epicyclic motions , or , given that in @xmath57 potentials all orbits close , to perturb the blobs motions into ellipses .",
    "then periastron precession induced by general relativistic effects ought to ensue .    a related mechanism for the generation of off  plane motions has been proposed for the jovian dust ring ( burns 1985 ) .",
    "it differs from the present one in that the individual units are not blobs of plasma , but single dust grains with nonzero electric charge , which are then acted upon by the normal lorenz force @xmath265 .",
    "it is easy to see that this differs from our case because the forces differ : in our case , the acceleration ( eq .",
    "1 ) is in the plane of the two vectors @xmath8 and @xmath266 , while in the jovian case the force is perpendicular to this plane .",
    "this difference has as a consequence that , in the jovian case , each magnetic field multipole has its own , single resonance , while in our case the two multipoles we explored have the same array of resonances , and the array is an infinite one .",
    "in short , in this paper we have shown that a simple interaction lifts blobs off the equatorial plane of a viscous accretion disk , provided the accreting object is not an aligned rotator .",
    "this occurs in a thin radial annulus , identified by eq .",
    "[ resonance ] .",
    "this conclusion is rather general , being independent of the exact form of the drag time  scale , of the blobs diamagnetic properties , and also of the assumed form for the disk viscosity .",
    "we have also shown why viscosity is unable to damp these motions ( section [ lt ] ) , and that this leads to modulation of the x  ray flux at the single particle precession frequency , or possibly twice as much .",
    "thus , the proposed identification of some qpos in the spectra of both atoll and z sources as due to lt  precession ( stella and vietri 1998 ) is made more likely by the existence of a relevant mechanism exciting blobs motions off the equatorial plane .",

    "<S> aperiodic variability and quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) are observed from accretion disks orbiting white dwarfs , neutron stars , and black holes , suggesting that the flow is universally broken up into discrete blobs . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the interaction of these blobs with the magnetic field of a compact , accreting star , where diamagnetic blobs suffer a drag . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when the magnetic moment is not aligned with the spin axis , the resulting force is pulsed , and this can lead to resonance with the oscillation of the blobs around the equatorial plane ; a resonance condition where energy is effectively pumped into non  equatorial motions is then derived . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the same resonance condition applies for the quadrupolar component of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the conditions of applicability of this result , showing that they are quite wide . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that realistic complications , such as chaotic magnetic fields , buoyancy , radiation pressure , evaporation , kelvin  helmholtz instability , and shear stresses due to differential rotation do not affect our results . in accreting neutron stars with millisecond periods , </S>",
    "<S> we show that this instability leads to lense  thirring precession of the blobs , and that damping by viscosity can be neglected . </S>"
