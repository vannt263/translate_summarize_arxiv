    "the form factor ( ff ) @xmath2 of the electromagnetic transition @xmath0 is one of the simplest exclusive processes , for investigation of which at large momentum transfers methods of the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) can be applied @xcite . for computation of @xmath2 various theoretical methods and schemes were proposed .",
    "they range from the pqcd calculations @xcite , the light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) @xcite , to the running coupling approach @xcite , employed to estimate power - suppressed corrections to @xmath1 .",
    "all of these methods are based on the pqcd factorization theorems , in accordance of which the amplitude of an exclusive process can be computed as the convolution integral of a hard - scattering amplitude and the process - independent distribution amplitude ( da ) of an involved into the process hadron(s ) .",
    "the hard - scattering amplitude is calculable within the qcd perturbation theory , whereas the hadron ( in our case , the pion ) das are universal functions containing nonperturbative information on hadronic binding effects , and can not be obtained using tools of pqcd .",
    "hence , the hadron das emerge as one of the two building blocks in studying numerous exclusive processes .    to calculate the @xmath0 transition ff in the framework of the qcd lcsr method @xcite ,",
    "adopted also in this paper , the knowledge of the pion different twist das @xmath3 is required .",
    "as we have just mentioned , they can not be found by means of pqcd .",
    "their factorization scale @xmath4 dependence is governed by pqcd , but an input information at the starting point of evolution , i.e. , the dependence of the das on the variable @xmath5 ( the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the quark in the pion ) at the normalization point @xmath6 , has to be extracted from experimental data or derived via nonperturbative methods , for example , the qcd sum rules @xcite , instanton - based models @xcite , or lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there exists the regular theoretical approach for treatment of the hadron das .",
    "it suggests the parametrization of the hadron das in terms of a partial wave expansion in conformal spin , and rely on the conformal symmetry of the qcd lagrangian @xcite .",
    "it is important that any parametrization of da based on a truncated conformal expansion is consistent with the qcd equations of motion @xcite and is preserved by the qcd evolution to the leading logarithmic accuracy @xcite .",
    "therefore , the conformal expansion provides a practical framework for modeling of the hadron das @xcite and is widely used for investigation of numerous exclusive processes in qcd .",
    "because of the increasing number of parameters at higher conformal spins and practical difficulties in phenomenological applications , one has to restrict one s self by taking into account only the first few terms in the conformal expansion of das . as a result ,",
    "the contributions of higher conformal spins to das in the existing calculations are neglected . at the same time , the suppression of higher spin contributions and the convergence of conformal expansion at present experimentally accessible energy regimes is not obvious and requires further studies .    the renormalon model proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite pursues to test precisely this issue ; that is , to set a plausible upper bound for the possible contributions of higher conformal spins that so far escaped attention . the renormalon approach employs the assumption that the infrared renormalon ambiguities in the leading twist coefficient functions should cancel the ultraviolet renormalon ambiguities in the matrix elements of twist-4 operators in a relevant operator product expansion .",
    "such cancellation was proved by explicit calculations in the case of the simple exclusive amplitude involving pseudoscalar and vector mesons @xcite .",
    "the idea of the renormalon model for the meson twist-4 das is to define them by taking the functional form of the corresponding ultraviolet renormalon ambiguities and replacing the overall normalization constant by a suitable nonperturbative parameter .",
    "it turns out that this is enough to obtain the set of two- and three - particle twist-4 das of the pion and and @xmath7-meson in terms of the corresponding leading twist ( twist-2 ) das .",
    "it is remarkable that the set of twist-4 das , apart from the parameters in the leading twist da , depend only on one new parameter .",
    "the latter can be related to the matrix element of some local operator and estimated using the qcd sum rules .",
    "a generic feature of the renormalon model is that it predicts higher twist distributions that are larger at the end points compared to the lowest conformal spin ( i.e. , the asymptotic ) distributions , and are expected to modify a behavior of higher twist contributions in exclusive reactions .",
    "in fact , in our previous work @xcite we employed the renormalon - inspired twist-4 das for computation of the pion electromagnetic ff @xmath8 in the context of the lcsr method , and found that the new das enhance the twist-4 component of ff starting from @xmath9 , and shift it towards larger values of @xmath10 .",
    "such modification affects the data fitting procedure and extraction of the parameters @xmath11 in the pion leading twist da , because in the renormalon approach the twist-4 contribution to @xmath8 depends on the same parameters , as the twist-2 one , and is not a `` frozen '' background like in the standard analyses @xcite .    in the present work we reanalyze the @xmath0 transition ff within the qcd lcsr method applying the renormalon - inspired model for the twist-4 das .",
    "we compare our predictions with the cello cello and cleo @xcite data on this process and deduce constraints on the parameters @xmath12 at the normalization scale @xmath13 .",

    "nevertheless , the lcsr results obtained using the renormalon - inspired and standard das predict the pion leading twist das with @xmath177 . stated differently",
    ", effects due to higher conformal spin components of the twist-4 das remain under control and do not spoil the qcd lcsr method .",
    "the new contribution of this work is that the renormalon approach has allowed one to put an upper bound on the twist-4 contribution to the light - cone sum rules and obtain estimates of the effects due to higher conformal spins.on the example of the @xmath0 transition , it also demonstrated limits of theoretical uncertainties inherent to our knowledge of exclusive processes .",
