    "x - ray pulsars most commonly occur as members of binary systems and their primary energy source is believed to be accretion from a donor star onto the neutron star .",
    "however , about a half dozen x - ray pulsars have been identified over the past decade that do not show the telltale doppler shifts associated with orbital motion and have slow pulsation periods of @xmath1 6 - 12 s and similar x - ray properties .",
    "they are now known collectively as anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) .",
    "the apparent absence of a donor star , slow pulsation periods , and x - ray luminosity levels of axps suggest that their x - ray emission is not powered by binary accretion or rotational energy loss .",
    "two somewhat different pictures have emerged to explain the x - ray emission .",
    "it has been proposed that axps are single neutron stars with intense magnetic fields b @xmath2 10@xmath3 g known as `` magnetars '' ( duncan & thompson 1992 ) whose energy release via magnetic field decay heats the neutron star surface to x - ray emitting temperatures ( thompson & duncan 1996 = td96 ) .",
    "this idea is attractive but a direct measurement to confirm the presence of the very high magnetic field strengths postulated for magnetars is still needed .",
    "a second possibility is that the x - ray emission may be due to accretion from a residual disk ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1995 ; chatterjee , hernquist , & narayan 2000 ; alpar 2001 ) .",
    "the x - ray properties of axps have been summarized by mereghetti et al .",
    "( 2002 = m02 ) and kaspi & gavriil ( 2004 = kg04 ) .",
    "axps have moderately soft x - ray spectra and x - ray luminosities in the range l@xmath4 @xmath5 10@xmath6 - 10@xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "acceptable spectral fits generally require two components . in most cases",
    "the emission is modeled with a thermal ( e.g. blackbody ) component at kt@xmath9 @xmath1 0.4 - 0.6 kev plus a harder power - law component",
    ". a wide range of photon power - law indices @xmath10 @xmath1 2 - 5 has been reported in the literature ( m02 , perna et al .",
    "2001 = p01 ) .",
    "the origin of the non - thermal power - law emission is uncertain but it is thought to arise in the magnetosphere ( m02 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the cool thermal x - ray emission as integrated blackbody emission from the surface of the neutron star is problematic for axps because the source radius inferred from isothermal blackbody fits is usually only a small fraction of the radius of a neutron star ( r@xmath11 @xmath1 10 km ) .",
    "this result could be explained if the intrinsic surface emission is masked by more luminous x - ray emission originating in hot spots that cover only a small fraction of the stellar surface .",
    "gotthelf & halpern ( 2005 , = gh05 ) have suggested that this is the case for the emission of the transient axp xte j1810@xmath0197 monitored during the decay phase of a recent outburst .",
    "they model its emission as a concentric spot arrangement using a two - temperature blackbody model and argue that this model is more physically meaningful for xte j1810@xmath0197 than the usual blackbody @xmath12 power - law interpretation .",
    "the spot interpretation offers a promising means of explaining the variable x - ray emission of transient axps such as xte j1810@xmath0197 but the origin of quiescent emission from axps is another question .",
    "the issue of small source radii inferred from blackbody models of quiescent axps was explored by p01 .",
    "they noted that the intrinsic x - ray spectrum of a magnetar will differ from that of a simple blackbody due to the effects of anisotropic heat flow through the envelope , reprocessing of photons by a light - element atmosphere , and general relativistic corrections .",
    "thus , source radii inferred from blackbody fits of magnetars may be incorrect .",
    "they developed a sophisticated magnetar model incorporating the above effects and used it to fit the _ asca _ x - ray spectra of five axps .",
    "the source radii inferred from their magnetar models were generally consistent with the radius of a neutron star , but interestingly their spectral fits still required a power - law component .",
    "the x - ray temperatures determined from their magnetar models were kt@xmath13 @xmath1 0.3 - 0.4 kev , which are slightly lower than the blackbody temperatures but still higher than expected for thermal cooling alone .",
    "since only a handful of axps are presently known , additional objects are needed to fully characterize their x - ray properties and guide the development of realistic x - ray emission models .",
    "we analyze here the x - ray spectrum of a new 10.6 s pulsar that was serendipitously detected in two sensitive _ chandra _ observations of the galactic starburst cluster westerlund 1 ( wd1 ) in may - june 2005 ( skinner et al . 2005 = s05 ; muno et al .",
    "2006 = m06 ; skinner et al .",
    "2006 = s06 ) .",
    "this object shows several of the characteristic x - ray properties of axps including slow pulsations , a thermal component temperature kt @xmath1 0.5 - 0.6 kev , a possible power - law contribution , and an inferred emitting area from isothermal blackbody fits that is much less than the surface area of a neutron star . _",
    "ntt _ images show no evidence for an infrared counterpart down to a limiting magnitude k@xmath14 = 18.5 ( s05 , m06 ) which initially seems to rule out a massive ( @xmath151 m@xmath16 ) companion and thus strengthens the axp classification .",
    "even so , thermal emission models indicate that the wd 1 pulsar is less luminous in x - rays than other axps based on current distance estimates .",
    "it has recently been argued that the 10.6 s pulsar in wd 1 is a magnetar ( m06 ) .",
    "however , further observational work will be needed to confirm this hypothesis . the existing constraint on the spin - down rate from two _ chandra _ observations spaced @xmath11 month apart is not yet sufficient to rule out spin - down as the x - ray energy source . in addition , more sensitive optical / ir / millimeter searches are necessary to determine if a low - mass companion or residual disk are present .",
    "it is our objective here to examine more sophisticated x - ray spectral models for the wd 1 pulsar that go beyond the isothermal blackbody model considered in earlier work .",
    "most importantly , we consider a model that assumes the neutron star is a magnetar and show that the source radius inferred from the magnetar model is still much less than that of a neutron star .",
    "this result gives support to the idea that the detected x - ray emission originates mainly in one or more localized regions ( hot spots ) covering only a small fraction of the neutron star surface .",
    "such spots could form on the surface of a magnetar but might also occur as heated polar caps on a conventional x - ray pulsar .",

    "( 2005 = b05 ) gives d = 4 kpc . in the following we",
    "adopt a distance d = 5 kpc to the pulsar based on the assumption that it is associated with wd 1 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the acis - s spectrum of the pulsar .",
    "the spectrum is heavily absorbed below @xmath11 kev .",
    "strong absorption is anticipated if the pulsar lies in ( or behind ) wd 1 based on cluster extinction estimates and the total galactic hi column density toward the pulsar , which is n@xmath29 = 2.2 @xmath26 10@xmath30 cm@xmath27 based on the heasarc n@xmath29 calculation tool .",

    "our spectral fits of the wd 1 pulsar with models that include a thermal ( e.g. blackbody ) component yield n@xmath29 estimates that are at or slightly below the low end of this range ( table 1 ) .",
    "the pulsar spectrum shows no obvious lines with the possible exception of a weak emission feature near 3.5 kev .",
    "as figure 3 shows , this feature is most apparent in the longer second observation but is only weakly present ( if at all ) in the shorter first observation .",
    "since the feature is not clearly present in the first observation , its reality is in doubt .",
    "there are no known thermal emission lines near kt = 3.5 kev or near kt = 4.5 kev , where the latter value is corrected for gravitational redshift ( m@xmath11 = 1.4 m@xmath16 , r@xmath11 = 10 km ) .",
    "we are not aware of any instrumental effects that would give rise to a feature near 3.5 kev .",
    "there is a gold m edge at 3.428 kev but a detectable _ emission _",
    "feature from this edge seems unlikely .",
    "if the feature is confirmed as an emission line in higher signal - to - noise spectra , a nonthermal interpretation will likely be required .",
    "for the spectral analysis discussed below , we focus on the spectrum from the second observation in june 2005 , which provides the best signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we attempted to fit the spectrum with a variety of emission models , as summarized in table 1 .",
    "all models included an absorption component based on cross - sections from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .      before considering models that include a thermal emission component , we note for completeness that the spectrum can be acceptably fitted with a simple power - law model ( model a in table 1 ) .",
    "the n@xmath29 and unabsorbed x - ray luminosity log l@xmath33 = 34.44 ergs s@xmath8 determined from this power - law model are larger than obtained from models that include thermal emission and the inferred n@xmath29 is at or above the maximum expected from a@xmath32 estimates ( sec .",
    "simple power - law models have been used to fit the soft - band x - ray spectra of some rotation - powered pulsars ( becker & trmper 1997 ) , but acceptable fits of axps based on good - quality x - ray spectra typically require at least two emission components ( e.g. blackbody @xmath12 power - law ) .",
    "thus , if the wd 1 pulsar is an axp then the ability to fit its spectrum with a simple power - law model may be a consequence of limited signal - to - noise in the existing _ chandra _ data .",
    "the rather high n@xmath29 deduced from the power - law model motivates us to consider models that include a thermal component , as discussed below .      an isothermal blackbody model ( model b in table 1 )",
    "yields an acceptable fit with kt@xmath9 = 0.59 kev . although the fit is formally acceptable ( @xmath34/dof = 34.7/35 = 0.99 ) , x - ray modeling of other axps ( p01 ) suggests that a power - law component may also be present .",
    "a two - component blackbody @xmath12 power - law model ( model c in table 1 ) provides only a minor improvement in the @xmath34 fit statistic .",
    "thus , the existing _ chandra _ data are consistent with a two - component blackbody @xmath12 power - law model but it is not necessary to include both components to obtain an acceptable fit .",
    "our best - fit blackbody @xmath12 power - law model gives a photon power - law index @xmath10 @xmath1 1.8 , but this value is not tightly constrained . in this blackbody @xmath12 power - law model",
    "the power - law component could contribute as much as @xmath140% of the observed ( absorbed ) flux in the 0.3 - 8 kev range ( table 1 ) .",
    "the inferred source radius is in the range r@xmath14 = 0.27 - 0.36 km for the two blackbody models in table 1 .",

    "it is thus obvious that we are not detecting thermal emission emanating from the surface of a neutron star , assuming the intrinsic spectrum is an isothermal blackbody . as already noted ( sec .",
    "1 ) , blackbody models may yield incorrect radii due to atmospheric effects .",
    "we investigate this possibility below in the case where the x - ray source is assumed to be a magnetar .",
    "the magnetar model developed by p01 assumes an underlying highly magnetized neutron star of mass m@xmath11 = 1.4 m@xmath16 cooling via blackbody emission that is reprocessed through a light - element highly magnetized atmosphere ( heyl & hernquist 1998 ) .",
    "the model computes the phase - averaged flux as a function of photon energy @xmath35 , taking into account anisotropic heat flow through the envelope due to magnetic field effects and general relativistic light deflection ( eqs .",

    "the angle @xmath50 is the angle between the magnetic pole and line - of - sight , @xmath51 is the angle between an emitted photon and the normal to the surface , and @xmath52 @xmath40 sin @xmath51 .",

[ 5 ] of p01 ) , and @xmath56 ) specifies the local emission at a point on the surface as a function of the local temperature @xmath57 ( eq . [ 6 ] of p01 ) .",
    "we incorporated the magnetar model of p01 into xspec and reran the blackbody fits discussed above , replacing the blackbody model with the magnetar model .",
    "the magnetar fit results are summarized as models d and e in table 1 . in our implementation",
    ", the radius of the neutron star and the stellar distance were specified as input parameters .",
    "for the fits in table 1 we assumed r@xmath11 = 10 km and d = 5 kpc .",
    "the model was used to find the best - fit value of the neutron star pole temperature and flux normalization factor norm@xmath58 = f@xmath59/f@xmath60 , where f@xmath59 is the unabsorbed flux due to the thermal component over the fitted energy range and f@xmath60 is the flux predicted by the model for a magnetar of the assumed radius and distance .",
    "as table 1 shows , the @xmath34 fit statistics for the magnetar models are comparable to or slightly better than those for the blackbody models .",
    "the overall fit for the two - component magnetar @xmath12 power - law model ( model e ) shown in figure 4 looks nearly identical to that of the blackbody @xmath12 power - law model ( fig .",
    "however , a comparison of the unfolded spectra in figures 2 and 5 shows that contribution of a power - law component is much less in the magnetar @xmath12 power - law model .",
    "the overall shape of the spectrum is matched quite well with the magnetar component alone , and any power - law component need not contribute more than @xmath115% of the observed flux ( 0.3 - 8 kev ) .",
    "the inferred magnetar pole temperatures are in the range kt@xmath42 = 0.44 - 0.48 kev .",
    "these values are 10% - 20% less than those obtained with the corresponding blackbody models , but still too high to be reconciled with thermal cooling alone .",
    "a similar result was noted by p01 when fitting _ asca _",
    "spectra for five axps , and they concluded that additional heating ( possibly by magnetic field decay ) is needed to explain the high temperatures .",
    "it is apparent from table 1 that the flux normalization factor norm@xmath58 is much less than unity for the magnetar models . by definition of norm@xmath58 ( see above ) , this indicates that the unabsorbed flux predicted by the magnetar model with r@xmath11 = 10 km and d = 5 kpc is @xmath510@xmath49 greater than that determined from the x - ray spectrum . since the leading term in the magnetar flux relation ( eq .",
    "1 ) is the blackbody flux , the flux mismatch indicates that the source radius is much less than r@xmath11 , provided that d = 5 kpc is not a serious underestimate .",
    "this is shown in the last row of table 1 , which gives the source radius r@xmath14 determined from the blackbody formula ( which we emphasize is only an approximation in the magnetar case ) .",
    "the discrepancy could be removed by assuming the pulsar is @xmath510 times more distant , but this seems unlikely if the pulsar is indeed associated with wd 1 .",
    "we thus conclude that the observed x - ray emission can not be readily explained as global emission coming from the surface of a magnetar cooling through a light - element atmosphere .",
    "the spectral analysis in section 4 shows the following : ( i ) most of the observed x - ray flux in the _ chandra _ bandpass can be accounted for by thermal models but a possible power - law contribution is not ruled out by the existing data , ( ii ) thermal models give a characteristic temperature in the range kt @xmath1 0.4 - 0.6 kev , which is higher than expected for neutron star cooling alone , ( iii ) the inferred source radius from blackbody models is r@xmath14 @xmath61 0.4 km and ( iv ) a magnetar model for a neutron star of radius r@xmath11 = 10 km emitting from its entire surface overestimates the flux , indicative of an emitting region that is considerably smaller than r@xmath11 unless the pulsar distance d = 5 kpc is significantly underestimated .",
    "thus , the models considered here point to a small emitting region of relatively warm plasma ( t @xmath5 5 - 7 mk ) as the origin of most of the observed x - ray emission .",
    "a plausible explanation is that the emission arises from one or more high - temperature regions or `` hot spots '' on the neutron star surface , rather than from the entire surface of a cooling neutron star .",
    "we obtain an equivalent blackbody source radius in the range r@xmath14 = 0.27 - 0.52 km ( table 1 ) , but this does not necessarily correspond to the radius of any particular spot since multiple spots may be present .",
    "we have assumed d = 5 kpc but the conclusion of a small emitting region r@xmath14 @xmath62 r@xmath11 holds even if the distance is twice that value .",
    "the ratio of source emitting area to stellar surface area ( r@xmath14/r@xmath11)@xmath49 @xmath5 10@xmath63 obtained here is comparable to that obtained for some field pulsars with magnetic field strengths below the magnetar range ( e.g. greiveldlinger et al .",
    "1996 ) but is smaller than the typical ratio ( r@xmath14/r@xmath11)@xmath49 @xmath5 10@xmath8 derived for the axps studied by durant & van kerkwijk ( 2006 ) .",
    "spots can form on a magnetar as a result of the local concentration of magnetic field lines ( td96 ) . in that case , the equivalent blackbody temperature of a spot is expected to anti - correlate with the spot radius for objects having the same l@xmath33 ( eq . [ 92 ] of td96 ) .",
    "the calculation of equivalent blackbody radii made possible by new distance determinations of several galactic axps ( durant & van kerkwijk 2006 ) suggests that such an anti - correlation may be present",
    ".    spots can also form as a result of accretion onto the neutron star , even if it is not a magnetar .",
    "assuming that the wd 1 pulsar does not have a low - mass companion , the accretion reservoir could in principle be a fallback disk created after the supernova explosion ( chatterjee et al .",
    "2000 ; alpar 2001 ) or the ism ( blaes & madau 1993 ) .",
    "more sensitive images in the infrared and at millimeter wavelengths are needed to determine if a disk is present .",
    "this question is of considerable interest given the recent detection of mid - ir emission at the position of the isolated young pulsar 4u 0142@xmath1261 ( wang et al .",
    "these authors argue that the mid - ir emission arises in a passive x - ray heated disk around the neutron star that may have originated from supernova ejecta that subsequently fell back onto the neutron star .",
    "until observational evidence for a disk around the wd 1 pulsar is presented , any conclusions based on disk models should be considered speculative .",
    "we only remark that if the pulsation period p = 10.6 s is close to the equilibrium period for uniform spin - down by a disk ( eq . [ 6 ] of td96 ) then a dipole field strength b@xmath64 @xmath5 10@xmath65 g. is inferred from l@xmath33 ( table 1 ) .",
    "this field strength is a lower limit if the detected emission is dominated by spots since the total l@xmath33 would contain an additional contribution from the cooling surface of the neutron star that may be masked by absorption .",

    "this conclusion is strengthened by the recent work of durant & van kerkwijk ( 2006 ) , who conclude that axp x - ray luminosities are typically l@xmath33 @xmath5 10@xmath7 ergs s@xmath8 .",
    "it thus appears that the wd 1 pulsar is underluminous in x - rays relative to previously known axps .",
    "there are several possible explanations for the apparent low x - ray luminosity , apart from the obvious possibility of an underestimated distance .",
    "since the x - ray temperature obtained for the wd 1 pulsar is similar to other axps ( p01 ) the lower l@xmath33 may just be an indication of a smaller emitting area ( i.e. emission dominated by highly localized spots ) .",
    "alternatively , if the wd 1 pulsar and other axps are magnetars powered by magnetic field decay , then the lower l@xmath33 for the wd 1 pulsar could be an indication of lower magnetic field strength ( b ) .",
    "the surface heat flux of a magnetar scales sensitively as b@xmath69 ( eq . [ 91 ] of td96 ) .",
    "although l@xmath33 for the wd 1 pulsar does seem low , it should be kept in mind that only a few axps are presently known and the axp x - ray luminosity function is not well - sampled .",
    "observational selection effects may have biased previous axp identifications toward more x - ray luminous members of the class .",
    "finally , the discrepancy could be resolved if the simple power - law model ( model a ) is correct . however , as we have already noted , a simple power - law model is likely an over - simplification of the true intrinsic spectrum if the wd 1 pulsar is an axp .",
    "do we need to invoke the magnetar interpretation for the wd 1 pulsar ? could its x - ray luminosity be powered by spin - down instead of an ultra - strong magnetic field ?",

    "the x - ray emission detected by _",
    "chandra _ from the 10.6 s pulsar in wd 1 is not global surface emission from a cooling neutron star or magnetar .",
    "both blackbody and magnetar models imply an emitting region that is much smaller than the radius of a neutron star . models that include a thermal component show that the observed emission most likely arises from one or more hot spots ( kt @xmath1 0.5 kev ) covering a small fraction of the surface .",
    "any cool ( kt @xmath28 0.1 kev ) emission from the cooling surface would have been heavily attenuated by intervening absorption .",

    ".    since the pulsar has only recently been discovered , further observational work will be needed to clarify its nature .",
    "deeper optical / ir / millimeter searches for a low - mass companion or residual disk will be particularly important for the x - ray interpretation .",
    "a higher signal - to - noise x - ray spectrum is needed to distinguish between competing emission models and a tighter constraint on p from continued x - ray time monitoring would be useful to determine if spin - down can account for the x - ray luminosity .",
