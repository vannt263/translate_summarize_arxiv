    "a @xmath10-field can not be flat at any point . recall ( see  @xcite , chapter  5 , ",
    "3 ) that every non - flat singular point  @xmath62 of a smooth planar vector field is either monodromic or has a characteristic trajectory ( i.e. a trajectory that tends to  @xmath62 as @xmath63 or @xmath64 , being tangent to some line at  @xmath62 ) .      topological type of monodromic singular point is determined by its poincare map .",
    "this map can not have infinite number of isolated fixed points due to the finiteness theorem , since these fixed points correspond to limit cycles ( see  @xcite , @xcite and also  @xcite ) .",
    "thus every monodromic singular point of a @xmath10-field is either a focus , or a center .      a small neighbourhood of a characteristic singular point  @xmath62 splits into the union of standard sectors .",
    "there are three types of standard sectors : hyperbolic , elliptic , and parabolic ( see  @xcite , chapter  5 ,  3 and figure  [ sectors ] ) .",
    "this splitting is not canonical : if we shrink the neighbourhood , then some parts of the elliptic sector will become parabolic sectors .",
    "nevertheless definition  [ complexity ] and definition  [ separatrix ] are `` invariant '' .",
    "we want to compactify the phase space by adding an infinite point to the plane . to get a chart in the neighbourhood of this point we identify the plane with the 2-sphere , punctured at the north pole , by stereographic projection .",
    "the projection from the south pole gives a chart in the neighbourhood of the infinite point .",
    "the transition between these charts is given by @xmath65 thus in the second chart our vector field has the form @xmath66 where @xmath3 is a polynomial vector field . set @xmath67 the fields of lines , corresponding to  @xmath6 and  @xmath68 , agree on @xmath69 .",
    "thus they can be patched together to the field  @xmath70 on the sphere .",
    "the infinite point is a singular point of  @xmath70 , thus the trajectories of  @xmath70 are those of  @xmath6 plus the infinite point .",
    "this is why we need an extra @xmath71 factor in ( [ infinity ] ) ( otherwise we could have a trajectory of  @xmath70 corresponding to two trajectories of  @xmath6 ) .    the following convention will be taken : the infinite point is considered a singular point of  @xmath6 .",
    "[ complexity]_complexity _ of a characteristic singular point is the number of its hyperbolic and elliptic sectors .",
    "complexity of a monodromic singular point is zero .",

    "the oval is a cycle of  @xmath6 .",
    "thus  @xmath80 consists of isolated points and cycles of  @xmath6 .",
    "now bezout s theorem tells us that  @xmath80 has at most @xmath72 isolated points .",
    "it is an easy consequence of lemma  [ curve ] that in every hyperbolic or elliptic sector of a singular point of  @xmath6 there is a point of @xmath76 where  @xmath6 is tangent to this curve ; for @xmath85 small enough these points are distinct and isolated ( the latter follows from the fact that a characteristic singular point has a neighbourhood without cycles ) .",

    "since  @xmath87 does not change along this curve , the curve consists of singular points of  @xmath6 but this is impossible .",

    "consider the region bounded by a limit polycycle , a focus , or a limit cycle and the corresponding cycle without contact .",
    "this region contains neither singular points , nor limit cycles , nor other chosen cycles without contact .",
    "every trajectory , tending to a polycycle , to a focus , or to a limit cycle , intersects the corresponding cycle without contact at exactly one point .",

    "fix such a system of cycles without contact .",
    "[ nasty ] every nasty separatrix intersects exactly one cycle without contact at exactly one point .",
    "we can assume that @xmath102-limit set of a nasty separatrix  @xmath118 is a characteristic limit point .",
    "it follows from lemmas  [ nice ] and  [ limitset ] that its @xmath101-limit set is a focus , a limit polycycle , or a limit cycle .",
    "denote the corresponding cycle without contact by  @xmath160",
    ". then  @xmath118 intersects  @xmath160 at exactly one point .",
    "it remains to prove that @xmath118 does not intersect other cycles without contact .",
    "indeed , if @xmath118 intersects another cycle  @xmath161 , then the corresponding focus , limit cycle , or limit polycycle should coincide with @xmath101-limit set of @xmath118 .",
    "thus @xmath160 and @xmath161 correspond to the same @xmath101-limit set .",
    "there are only two situations when it happens : ( 1 ) @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the cycles without contact corresponding to the same limit cycle and ( 2 ) @xmath160 and @xmath161 correspond to limit polycycles which coincide as sets but have different co - orientation of trajectories .",
    "the first case is impossible , since @xmath118 would have to intersect this limit cycle . in the second case",
    "the polycycle is necessarily homeomorphic to the circle ; @xmath118 would have to intersect the polycycle , which is impossible .",
    "thus a nasty separatrix is cut by the point of its intersection with the corresponding cycle without contact into two parts .",
    "the part that is the boundary trajectory of a hyperbolic sector is called _",
    "truncated separatrix_.    the _ large graph _ has all the vertices and edges of the small graph and the following    vertices : : :    the intersection points of the nasty separatrices with the chosen    cycles without contact . edges",
    ": : :    the truncated nasty separatrices and the segments of the cycles    without contact in which they are split by the vertices , oriented    counterclockwise ( if the cycle intersects no separatrix , then this    cycle is not added to the large graph ) .",
    "now we want to equip vertices and edges of the graph with some data .",
    "we indicate on a vertex whether it is a repeller , an attractor , a clockwise rotation center , a counterclockwise rotation center , or none of the above ( e.g. a saddle ) .",
    "thus there are * 5 * possible equippings of a vertex .    on every edge",
    "we indicate whether it is a part of a cycle without contact , a trajectory of an elliptic sector , a separatrix , or an edge , corresponding to a limit cycle .",

    "we mark this side of  @xmath162 by the symbol  @xmath101 , @xmath102 , or 0 , depending on the type of polycycle .",
    "it the side of a separatrix is not marked with  @xmath101 , @xmath102 , or  @xmath158 ( e.g. the separatrix does not belong to any limit polycycle ) we mark this side with @xmath163 . in the same way we equip the edge , corresponding to a limit cycle .",
    "however , only  @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and  @xmath163 are possible for a side of a limit cycle .",
    "indeed , since the poincare map of a limit cycle is analytic there are only two possibilities : this map is either identity , or the set of its fixed points is discrete",
    ". it can not be identity , since the cycle is limit , thus 0 is impossible on a limit cycle .",
    "the combination @xmath164 is also impossible .",
    "the other combinations are possible : for example , @xmath165 means that the limit cycle is a stable boundary limit cycle ( see definition  [ pfield ] ) .",
    "thus there are * 8 * possible equippings of a limit cycle .    for a separatrix all the combinations are possible . if a separatrix marked with anything except @xmath164 , then it is nice and its @xmath101-germ and @xmath102-germ are both boundary trajectories of some hyperbolic sectors by definition of limit polycycle .",
    "if a separatrix is marked with @xmath164 , then we shall indicate if its @xmath101-germ and @xmath102-germ are boundary trajectories of hyperbolic sectors .",
    "there are * 3 * cases because at least one germ should be a boundary trajectory of a hyperbolic sector by definition of separatrix .",
    "notice that for a nasty separatrix the equipping is unnecessary but we shall keep it for simplicity .",
    "thus there are @xmath166 possible equippings of a separatrix .",
    "it adds up to @xmath167 possible equippings of an edge .",
    "[ technical ] suppose that two @xmath10-fields have their equipped graphs isomorphic ( as planar oriented equipped graphs )",

    "the proof of this proposition is a reformulation of the main result of  @xcite and is given in the appendix .",
    "let @xmath168 be the number of connected graphs on the sphere ( possibly with loops and multiple edges ) with at most  @xmath169 edges .",
    "then @xmath170 ( two graphs  @xmath171 and  @xmath172 are considered the same if they are isomorphic as embedded graphs . )",

    "let  @xmath173 be the number of rooted graphs with  @xmath169 edges .",
    "by  ( 5.1 ) of  @xcite @xmath174 a root is an additional structure .",
    "thus if we forget the root , then we decrease the number of graphs : @xmath175    there is another approach due to physicists .",
    "since every graph can be completed to a triangulation , and the number of subgraphs of a triangulation grows exponentially , it is enough to estimate the number of triangulations .",
    "the following integral is the generating function for these numbers ( for graphs of different genera ) : @xmath176 where  @xmath177 is the set of @xmath178 hermitian matrices , @xmath179 is the gaussian measure ( see  @xcite ,  7.1 ) .",
    "however , the author has never seen the proof of the required estimate , based on these methods .",
    "the _ size _ of a graph is the sum of the number of its edges and the number of its vertices .",
    "[ graphnum ] let @xmath180 be the number of oriented possibly disconnected graphs on the sphere ( possibly with loops and multiple edges ) with size at most  @xmath169 .",

    "suppose that this graph consists of  @xmath185 connected components , then @xmath186 .",
    "clearly , we can make the graph connected by adding @xmath187 edges .",
    "denote the new graph by @xmath188 . then the number of edges of  @xmath188 is less than  @xmath169 .",
    "thus every planar graph of size at most  @xmath169 can be obtained from a _ connected _ graph with at most  @xmath169 edges by deleting some edges",
    ". since there are at most @xmath189 subsets of edges of  @xmath188 , there are at most @xmath190 planar graphs with size  @xmath169 or less . putting an orientation on every edge , gives @xmath191 factor .",
    "thus @xmath192    in section  [ structure ] we have assigned an equipped graph to every @xmath10-field .    [ size ] the size of the graph , corresponding to a @xmath10-field of degree  @xmath0 with  @xmath21 limit cycles , is at most @xmath193 .",
    "denote by  @xmath194 and  @xmath195 the total numbers of elliptic and hyperbolic sectors respectively .",

    "the number of vertices of the small graph is at most @xmath199 ( remember the infinite singular point ! ) , the number of its edges is @xmath200 .",
    "the number of additional vertices of the large graph is  @xmath197 , the number of additional edges is  @xmath201 .",

    "now we can finish the proof of theorem  [ high ] .",
    "the theorem trivially holds for @xmath205 , since all the constant @xmath10-fields are topologically equivalent .",

    "set @xmath206 .",
    "using propositions  [ graphnum ] and  [ size ] , we see that there are at most @xmath207 possible graphs .",
    "every vertex of the graph can have one of 5 possible equippings , every edge of the graph can have one of 28 possible equippings , thus there are at most @xmath208 possible equippings .",
    "therefore there are at most @xmath209 possible equipped graphs .",
    "now we apply proposition  [ technical ] , it gives the estimate @xmath209 for the number of @xmath10-fields .",
    "further , @xmath210 theorem  [ high ] is proved .",
    "in  @xcite to every vector field on the sphere with finite number of `` singular elements '' a _ scheme _ is assigned .",
    "the main theorems of  @xcite ( theorems  75 and  76 of  29 ) assert that if two vector fields have the same schemes , then they are orbitally topologically equivalent . unfortunately , the definition of scheme ( definition  33 ,  29 ) is distributed all over the book .",
    "so our goal is to show that the scheme of a @xmath10-field can be recovered from the large graph of the field .",
    "we do this examining subsequently all the elements of the scheme . according to definition  33 of  29 , we need to list all the _ singular elements _ , _ limit continua _ , their _ global schemes _ , and all the pairs of _ conjugate free continua_. we shall recall all the relevant definitions from  @xcite .    the other issue is that  @xcite deals with bounded phase spaces . however , they mention that all the results are valid for a system on the sphere , see  29.5 .",
    "we shall have to adjust some definitions of  @xcite to this case .",
    "equilibrium states * are singular points in our terminology .",
    "they are vertices of our graph .",
    "notice that we can distinguish between singular points and other vertices of the graph , using equippings of edges adjacent to this vertices ( if there are no such edges , then the vertex is necessarily a singular point ) .",

    "we claim that orbitally unstable trajectories are exactly limit cycles and separatrices .",
    "indeed , limit cycles are orbitally unstable by theorem  37 of  15 .",
    "it is quite clear that the separatrices are orbitally unstable .",

    "it remains to show that we can ascertain from the graph whether two separatrices belong to the same limit polycycle .    to this end",
    "we just need to check whether one separatrix is the continuation of the other ( because a co - oriented separatrix has at most one continuation ) .",
    "this is the information we can get from the graph . thus the whole limit polycycle can be recovered from the graph .",

    "let @xmath160 be a cycle without contact , corresponding to a boundary limit cycle  @xmath159 .",
