    "both theoretically and observationally , core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) explosions are linked with the death of massive stars . however , because precise measurements of ccsn progenitor masses are scarce , the mapping between explosion scenario and the progenitor mass distribution is less clear .",
    "the most common method of progenitor mass determination is direct imaging , in which one identifies the progenitor star in multi - band pre - explosion imaging , fits a spectral energy distribution to the photometry , and verifies the star is gone once the sn has faded .",
    "this methodology is ideal given appropriate data , but it is limited to contemporary sne that have pre - explosion hubble space telescope ( hst ) or deep ground - based imaging . as a result ,",
    "only @xmath125 sne have any constraint on their progenitor masses , and half of these are only upper limits @xcite .",
    "a significant increase in the number of progenitor masses could allow us a powerful window into further understanding supernovae .",
    "direct imaging has created a prototypical picture of massive star death .",
    "type ii - p sne are assumed to be created by red supergiant ( rsg ) stars with intact hydrogen envelopes , while more exotic sne may be created by higher mass stars .",
    "however , a number of questions remain to be answered regarding supernova physics .",
    "@xcite identify what they term to be the ` red supergiant problem , ' an observed lack of progenitors of @xmath0@xmath116 - 30  m@xmath7that we would expect to explode as type ii - p sn .",
    "a variety of channels have been proposed to account for these missing explosions , including direct black hole formation or the stars exploding as different sn types .",
    "binarity of the progenitor system can also play a significant role in sn explosions .",
    "@xcite show that numbers of type ibc and iib explosions are significantly underestimated if single - star explosions are assumed to be the only sn channel .",
    "these issues are difficult to address without further progenitors to analyze .",
    "unfortunately , while direct - imaging of the progenitor star would be ideal , there are constraints that limit the frequency with which it may be applied .",
    "first , direct imaging is limited by the sn rate : roughly one per century in a large spiral galaxy @xcite .",
    "second , direct imaging requires that the host galaxy be close enough to resolve the progenitor star , an effective limit of @xmath120 mpc @xcite .",
    "third , preexisting sub - arcsecond images of the site must exist , necessitating archival hst images with either the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc-2 ) or the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "finally , even with the existence of appropriate images , there is no guarantee that the precursor will be identified .",
    "for example , @xcite summarized 20 progenitor detections in type ii - p explosions .",
    "only five progenitors were directly observed , and an additional two which fell on compact star clusters were well constrained .",
    "the remainder had no detection , but were given upper bounds based on the maximum luminosity with which they could escape detection ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in short , while direct imaging is ideal given appropriate data , it suffers from prerequisites that limit the number of opportunities in which it may be applied .",
    "it is clear that development of an independent and complementary technique would be of interest .    in this paper",
    "we make use of an alternative technique , stellar population analysis , to infer progenitor masses .",
    "the technique involves examining a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the surrounding population of stars to infer an age and mass for the progenitor star .",
    "the advantage of our methodology is that we are not reliant on individual identification and photometry of the specific progenitor star , leaving us free to apply our method to cataloged supernova remnants ( snrs ) in addition to directly observed sne .",
    "this ability drastically increases the number of progenitor masses we may find , allowing us to make a more complete measurement of the underlying distribution of progenitor masses .",
    "our method offers no direct way to probe the binarity of the system , which is relevant given the role binarity likely plays in certain ccsn scenarios .",
    "however , our estimate of the age of the surrounding stellar population is not affected by the particular details of a given progenitor system",
    ". our method also offers no way to determine the type of ccsn explosion we are observing , so for snr analysis we are not able to provide a direct link between sn explosion type and progenitor mass .",
    "however , we will be able to comment on the ranges of zams masses that are producing ccsn explosions .",
    "stellar population analysis has been used many times historically to analyze the characteristics of progenitors .",
    "many groups have carried out age dating of stellar clusters coincident with supernovae and derived corresponding stellar masses @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined the sfh map of the lmc published by @xcite .",
    "they estimate ages and masses for the four most recent snr produced by ccsne in the lmc . in @xcite",
    ", we employed a technique identical to the one used in this paper to estimate the age of the progenitor of ngc 300 ot2008 - 1 .",
    "we found that the star was likely to have formed 8 - 13 myr ago , corresponding to a @xmath0  of 12 - 17  m@xmath7 .",
    "finally , in @xcite we applied the same technique as this paper to archival images of sn 2011dh , finding a most likely age of 17@xmath8  myr and a @xmath0  of 13@xmath9  m@xmath7 .",
    "clearly there is a long list of successful applications of stellar population analysis leading to constraints on progenitor physical properties .    in this paper",
    "we examine 59 snrs in the spiral galaxy m31 , listed in table  [ tab_snr ] . in ",
    "2 we outline the methods used to determine star formation histories ( sfhs ) , ages , and masses for the progenitor stars . in ",
    "3 we present the results of the analysis .",
    "we find that 53 snr display recent star formation , and we derive masses for these .",
    "we also present four example cases that are representative of the overall sample .",
    "finally , in  4 we examine the distribution of progenitor masses .",
    "we search for indications of a minimum mass , which we find to be between 7.0 and 7.8  m@xmath7 , and note that the distribution is more bottom - heavy than a salpeter imf distribution .",
    "the basic procedure for deriving a mass estimate for each progenitor is as follows .",
    "we first use coordinates from three snr catalogs as explained in  2.2 , which we assume are accurate to within a few arcseconds and unbiased to any one type of sn .",
    "we then search for any appropriate hst fields that contain the snr in question .",
    "we perform photometry on the stars in each field , and create cmds of the region within @xmath150 pc of the snr coordinates , assuming a distance modulus of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "we use cmd fitting to measure the sfh of each region .",
    "for each region that displays recent sf , we use the age of this recent sf to associate an age with the progenitor star .",
    "finally , we apply stellar evolution models to convert the age of the progenitor to the @xmath0  of the progenitor .",
    "our method requires several assumptions to produce results . above all",
    ", we must assume that some of the stars surrounding the snr are in fact coeval with the progenitor star .",
    "there are several pieces of evidence suggesting this assumption is reasonable .",
    "first , 90% of stars form in clusters with sizes of @xmath11 pc @xcite .",
    "these stars are expected to stay spatially associated for timescales greater than the lifetimes of ccsne progenitors , even for dissolving , unbound clusters .",
    "second , theoretical predictions are that stars will stay spatially associated on scales of @xmath1100 pc for 100 myr @xcite .",
    "observational constraints support this @xcite , as do simulations by @xcite who found that @xmath185% of ccsne will explode within 100 pc of their birth site .",
    "in addition , even if a progenitor would travel farther , we would still expect to see a fraction of the coeval young stellar population which is sufficient for age dating .",
    "the precise number of interest is the fraction of young stars that will stay within a certain distance in the lifetime of a core collapse supernova progenitor .",
    "the question is a complex one , and we know of no research that quantifies it precisely at this time .",
    "we conclude that it is a reasonable assumption that most of the young stellar population around our observed snrs is coeval with their progenitors . based on the analysis in @xcite",
    ", we adopt a value of @xmath150 pc for the radius of our star selection annulus .",
    "our method does not assume any information about the type of sn that exploded .",
    "we assume that snrs associated with recent star formation are ccsne , but do not distinguish individual subtypes . for ccsne",
    ", the particular type of supernova has no effect on our mass determination process .",
    "however , the progenitors of thermonuclear type ia sne are likely to arise from older stellar populations which may vary considerably more in age than the coeval populations of massive stars .",
    "while there exists considerably discussion in the literature as to the precise nature of type ia progenitor systems and their distribution in age ( see @xcite and references therein ) , we would expect to see type ia progenitors ranging from ages of a few hundred myr to several gyr .",
    "since these timescales are comparable to or significantly greater than the dynamical timescale of m31 , our methodology of identifying and analyzing coeval stars is ineffective at measuring the precise ages of type ia progenitors .",
    "our method does have the risk of misinterpreting a type ia snr as a ccsnr . in their volume limited sample ( d @xmath11 60 mpc ) ,",
    "@xcite find that type ia sn compose 24% of observed sn .",
    "however , there are several qualitative reasons as to why one would expect a smaller ia / ccsn fraction in our survey .",
    "first , there is some discussion as to whether such a volume - limited survey may underestimate the fraction of ccsn due to their faintness compared to type ia sn ( see discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "this potential bias suggests that 24% could be considered an upper limit .",
    "in addition , the areas of m31 with greater hst coverage are primarily star forming regions , where we would naively expect ccsn to be more common , increasing the relative fraction of ccsn .",
    "thus the actual fraction of type ia snr we expect in our sample is probably somewhat less than 24% .",
    "moreover , it is likely that some type ia snr can be identified by their lack of an associated young stellar population .",
    "@xcite examined four ia sites in the lmc and found that three displayed a significant lack of recent star formation . out of the 59 examined , we found 6 snr displayed no recent sf in their surrounding stellar populations .",
    "finally , we have examined what effect additional hidden ia contamination will have on our data .",
    "the procedure we used is explained in  4.3 .",
    "we found that additional ia contamination up to a total fraction of @xmath125% has very little effect on the overall distribution observed in the sample .    to summarize",
    ", we argue that there are several qualitative reasons to assume that the effective ia fraction in our sample is smaller than 24% .",
    "in addition , our method offers a means to identify and remove some snr that are likely ia progenitors .",
    "finally , our overall results are largely insensitive to inclusion of additional ia contamination up to the 24% observed in the volume - limited survey from @xcite .",
    "another possibility for snrs with no coincident young sf is that they are the result of high - velocity progenitor stars that have left their birth sites . as a test of this possibility , we examined any site with no observed recent sf in galex fuv data .",
    "we found that all 6 sites with no recent sf are still relatively close ( @xmath150 to 100 pc ) to galex fuv sources .",
    "if we assume that the progenitor star resulted from the most nearby fuv source for each zero - sf snr , then a 50 myr old star would only require velocities of a few km / s to reach the snr site from the fuv source site , well within reasonable velocities for runaway stars .",
    "higher mass stars would of course require higher velocities to leave the fuv source in their shorter lifetimes .",
    "this analysis suggests that our study is unable to differentiate between type ia snr and snr resulting from high - velocity stars .",
    "we note , however , that a null - result for progenitor mass will not affect the distribution of progenitor masses we measure .",
    "it will simply reduce our effective sample size .    finally , our method is highly contingent on the accuracy of the stellar evolution models used to model our observed cmds . because the models are theoretical , they generally do not have easily quantifiable uncertainties .",
    "the wide array of available model sets tend to systematically differ in bolometric luminosity and temperature , but are consistent within about 0.2 mag in bolometric luminosity and 0.02 dex in log temperature .",
    "we therefore quantify the uncertainty of our results due to the models used by including random shifts in the bolometric luminosity and temperature of the models as part of our monte carlo ( mc ) tests ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we detail the process further in  2.5 .",
    "there are only a few extensive catalogs of snrs in m31 .",
    "we use the catalogs of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "all three make identifications based on [ sii]-to - h@xmath4 ratios , and @xcite make additional use of morphology and ob star associations .",
    "@xcite identify three confidence levels based on approximate levels of contamination , although they note that the confidence levels are somewhat subjective .",
    "we only perform analysis on their first and second confidence candidates .",
    "the catalogs are not mutually exclusive , and the coverage areas of the three catalogs overlap in several areas , causing several remnants to be identified in both catalogs . to avoid treating a double - identified remnant as two separate remnants",
    ", we identify all remnants from two separate catalogs in which the 50 pc areas overlap and only select coordinates from one catalog . in these duplicate cases , we adopted the coordinates first from @xcite , then from @xcite if @xcite did not identify a remnant in that position . on occasion , a single catalog identified two remnants in which these 50 pc regions overlapped , but we still performed analysis on both candidates in such a case .",
    "in addition , we cross - referenced the snr catalogs with @xcite and eliminated two , k567 and k884 , which were found to not be snr based on their optical / x - ray properties .    for our analysis",
    ", we require that the stellar population surrounding the snr be imaged by either the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) or the wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) instruments on hst in at least two broadband filters .",
    "we also require our 50% completeness limits ( see  2.3 ) for a given cmd to be at least 24.5 magnitude in f475w , f555w , or f606w , whichever represents the blue filter ( all qualifying fields of sufficient depth were either f475w , f555w , or f606w vs. f814w ) .",
    "the location of the ms turnoff is very similar in color in these filter sets , so adopting a similar magnitude cut in all three is reasonable .",
    "our comparisons between snrs imaged multiple times at varying depths indicate that simply reaching the ms turnoff for a given cmd is insufficient to correctly determine the age .",
    "cmd fitting is highly sensitive to densities of stars at given ages , requiring a well - sampled stellar population at the age of interest . in general",
    ", we found that our methodology applied to shallower data had a tendency to miss older bursts of sf which still may have resulted in ccsn .",
    "the available 2-filter broadband data for m31 happens to be distributed in two groups , including many shallow fields ( blue depth @xmath12 ) and many deep fields ( blue depth @xmath13 ) , with very few in between .",
    "the choice of our depth cut causes us to reject five snr that have only been imaged with shallow wfpc-2 data .    in table",
    "[ tab_snr ] we list the snr for which our criteria is met , along with the corresponding hst fields . in cases",
    "where the regions in question were imaged multiple times , we selected whichever set of images had the greatest number of stellar detections . in fig .",
    "[ spatial ] we chart the locations of the examined remnants on a star - subtracted image of m31 in h@xmath4 .",
    "those remnants colored red represent probable ia candidates , where no young sf was found .",
    "there is a clear grouping of ccsn candidates along the star forming arms of m31 .",
    "we performed resolved stellar photometry using the photometry pipeline developed for the acs nearby galaxy treasury program @xcite .",
    "this pipeline uses the dolphot stellar photometry package @xcite to fit the well - characterized acs point spread function to all of the point sources in the images .",
    "we then converted fluxes to vega magnitudes using the standard zero - points and aperture corrections from the acs handbook .",
    "we assess photometric errors and completeness using fake star tests .",
    "at least @xmath14 tests are performed by inserting fake stars of known color and magnitude into the data one at a time and blindly attempting to recover them with the same software .",
    "both fake star tests and photometry were performed on the full hst fields .",
    "cmd fitting is a powerful tool for measuring star formation histories @xcite . to estimate star formation histories of the regions surrounding the snr , we used the software package match @xcite .",
    "match works by creating many model cmds based on theoretical isochrones for a variety of ages and metallicities",
    ". a linear combination of these model cmds are then fit to the observed cmd .",
    "we use the models of @xcite and @xcite both for cmd fitting and estimation of @xmath0 .    for each field , we selected stars from our photometry catalog within a 15  radius around the snr coordinates , which equates to a physical size of @xmath150 pc at an assumed distance modulus of @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the spatial correlation discussed in  2.1 .",
    "we account for photometric errors through the use of fake star tests .",
    "we selected fake stars in a region @xmath12.5 times the radius of the real star annulus to ensure that at least a few thousand recovered fake stars are included for each snr .",
    "we defined lower magnitude limits as the point at which fake star completeness dipped below 50% .",
    "match requires a variety of parameters to generate and fit cmds .",
    "we assumed a salpeter imf , @xmath15 @xcite , and a binary fraction of 0.35 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that varying the imf value from -2.0 to -2.7 or varying the binary fraction from 0.2 to 0.5 had no effect on the epoch assigned to a recent burst .",
    "we also varied the imf from -1.3 to -3.3 for select regions and found no significant difference in relative fractions of sf for various epochs .",
    "although absolute amplitudes of sf did change , only relative amplitudes have an effect on our method of determining ages .",
    "note that the imf and binary fraction are used by match purely for purposes of populating the models .",
    "we assume nothing about either value with regards to a potential ccsn progenitor system or the overall progenitor mass distribution .",
    "match produces fits in logarithmic age bins .",
    "we adopted 71 age bins increasing in .05 increments from 6.60 ( 4 myr ) up to 10.10 ( 12.5 gyr ) .",
    "we are unable to fit for ages younger than this due to the lack of isochrones at younger ages .",
    "match will interpret any sf from a population younger than the 6.60 to 6.65 ( 4 to 4.5 myr ) bin as being included in this bin .",
    "thus our youngest bin actually includes all sf from present times back to 4.5 myr . as a result",
    ", we may only quote an upper age limit for any sf found in this youngest bin . in fig .",
    "[ isochrones ] we plot the isochrones for every - other age bin from 6.60 through 8.00 in f555w vs. f555w - f814w .",
    "fitting metallicity with match is not viable given the very weak dependence of the optical colors of the upper main sequence on metallicity .",
    "we therefore constrained the metallicity to a spread of @xmath10.15 dex and to increase with the lifetime of the galaxy , which consistently produced best - fit metallicities of solar .",
    "this value is consistent with the known gas - phase metallicity of m31 @xcite . finally , we binned our cmds in units of 0.3 in magnitude and 0.15 in color .",
    "this binning accounted for the fact that some fields had few upper ms stars , allowing us to reduce the impact of this paucity on our fits .",
    "however , we still maintain a number of bins significantly larger than the number of free parameters used in the fitting .",
    "we experimented with using finer binning and found no change in our age determinations within our uncertainties .",
    "recent sfhs are very sensitive to the treatment of reddening .",
    "our most simplistic treatment of reddening is to assume that all reddening is due to a galactic foreground , search over a specified range of reddening values for a best fit , and apply this value to the cmd as a whole .",
    "however , we frequently found significant differential reddening ( @xmath16 ) across our small snr - centered regions , which manifests as an increased width to the ms and red clump .",
    "star forming regions will typically have extensive amounts of dust and gas , often not uniformly distributed , and as such there is no reason to believe that a single reddening value would correctly describe the region as a whole .",
    "match by default allows for 0.5 mag of differential reddening for populations below 40 myr , after which it falls linearly down to 0.0 mag at 100 myr .",
    "in addition , the user has the ability to add additional full - field differential reddening across the cmd .",
    "we almost always found that the default treatment of reddening was inadequate to account for all the reddening present in the regions .",
    "as an example of how ignoring differential reddening can lead to an erroneous result , we consider the snr bw-102 .",
    "the photometry is quite deep , extending to magnitudes of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ bw102_nodav ] we plot the observed cmd of the region , as well as the best - fit model generated by match in the background in greyscale . in the right panel , we plot the cumulative sfh as a fraction of total sfh in the past 50 myr , assuming a fixed differential reddening of @xmath19 mags affecting only the young stars .",
    "we found a best - fit reddening value of @xmath20 .",
    "all the star formation is concentrated in the youngest time bin ( @xmath11 4.5 myr ) , corresponding to a lower limit @xmath0  of 52  m@xmath7 .",
    "however , several qualities of the cmd would cause us to be suspicious of this result .",
    "the main sequence appears very dim , and appears to contain lack the young , bright , blue stars that the model predicts at @xmath21 .",
    "we would not expect this given a result of very extensive young star formation .",
    "looking beyond the main sequence , we see that the red clump is extended over nearly 2 magnitudes in f475w .",
    "indeed , the model very poorly models the stars at @xmath22 , @xmath23thus not only was the default value of differential reddening insufficient to model the entire cmd , the treatment of differential reddening as something unique to the young stellar population is clearly not reflected in the reality of the cmd . for regions such as this ,",
    "it is necessary to apply differential reddening across the cmd .",
    "we must then define the amount of differential reddening to add .    to understand our technique for determining the amount of @xmath24 to use , we must expand on the differential reddening model used by match .",
    "match applies differential reddening to the model cmds by applying a top - hat distribution along the reddening line .",
    "the low end of the top - hat is defined by a foreground value of @xmath25 for which match fits .",
    "the width of the distribution is then defined by the specified value provided by the user .",
    "when applying additional differential reddening , fit values tended to improve until we reached unphysical values of @xmath16 the only true constraint we may apply is that this minimum value of @xmath25 must be at least equivalent to the milky way foreground value .",
    "@xcite find a foreground reddening value to m31 of @xmath26 .",
    "while this value is likely to change slightly over the angular size of m31 , the changes will clearly be small compared to the magnitude of differential reddening internal to m31 .",
    "our solution to cmds such as bw-102 is to increase the width of the differential reddening distribution applied to all ages until the best - fit value of @xmath25 match finds reaches the foreground value .",
    "we then use this differential reddening distribution to measure the sfh and derive the age of the sn progenitor .    in fig .",
    "[ bw102dav ] we plot the sfh results for a variety of differential reddening values , increasing from @xmath27 up to @xmath28 magnitudes , in increments of 0.1 .",
    "note that this differential reddening is in addition to the default young @xmath19 , leading to up to 2.0 magnitudes of differential reddening on the very youngest stellar populations .",
    "we found that a value of @xmath28 was the point at which the overall reddening value dropped to the expected foreground value for bw-102 .",
    "for this value of differential reddening , the sfh corresponded to an age of 36 myr and a mass of @xmath19  m@xmath7 , a much more reasonable result given the observed cmd .",
    "note that the sfh reaches this result ( within uncertainty ) before the best - fit @xmath29 value reaches foreground , suggesting that our result is not highly contingent on the precise value of foreground reddening assumed . in the left panel of fig  [ bw102 ] we plot the observed cmd with the best - fit model plotted in greyscale in the background , created using the above @xmath24 procedure . in the right panel ,",
    "we plot the cumulative sfh of the region for the past 50 myr , with error bars from the monte carlo analysis described in ",
    "2.5    we found essentially all fields suffered from differential reddening in excess of the default values used by match .",
    "when no extra differential reddening was included in the models , many regions without obvious young star formation were best fit by high overall reddening values and included star formation in the youngest few time bin .",
    "the issue arises from faint main sequence stars revealed by deep photometry . without inclusion of differential reddening , these stars are fit by the uniform foreground reddening value for the region , which is typically a high value ( e.g. @xmath30 ) . using this erroneously high value ,",
    "the stars are corrected to be brighter and bluer than they actually are , leading match to mistake them as evidence of young star formation . by allowing for differential reddening",
    ", we can incorporate the full range of different reddening values across the field .    for our final procedure ,",
    "we increase the amount of full - cmd differential reddening until we find the best fit @xmath25 reaches the foreground value , @xmath31 .",
    "we then adopt this value of differential reddening for subsequent analysis of that particular snr .",
    "our ultimate goal is to estimate the mass of the progenitor .",
    "we do this by identifying the burst of recent star formation from which the progenitor star most likely originated , allowing us to assign an age to each progenitor star . ideally , each sfh would have a single isolated burst , making it easy to associate a single age to the young stellar population .",
    "in many cases , however , multiple bursts of varying rates and durations appear in the young star formation history . as a result",
    ", we examine the cumulative star formation history of each cmd as a fraction of the total recent star formation .",
    "when examined as such , the fraction of star formation in each age bin corresponds to the probability that the progenitor will be of that age .",
    "because we are only interested in recent sf , we examine only the most recent 50 myr of sf ( see  4.1 for an explanation of this limit ) .",
    "our results suffer from both random uncertainties due to the sampling of the cmd and systematic errors due to differences between the theoretical isochrones and observations .",
    "for example , if the models were consistently redder than the observed stars , we would generally find younger ages when these models are applied to real data .",
    "the random errors are generally highly dependent on the number of upper main sequence stars in the field , with higher numbers providing a tighter constraint on the data ( although more upper main sequence stars may also simply indicate a younger population ) .",
    "see @xcite for further discussion of this point .    to analyze our uncertainties",
    ", we performed a series of monte carlo ( mc ) realizations of the data ( see also @xcite ) . in each mc",
    "run , we re - sampled the observed cmd to account for the poisson errors of the stars .",
    "in addition , to estimate how systematic model differences can impact the results , we add in random shifts to the models for each run .",
    "we used random shifts of @xmath32 in temperature and @xmath33 in bolometric luminosity .",
    "these systematic offsets are much larger than uncertainty in the distance modulus , thereby incorporating both effects into our overall uncertainty analysis .",
    "uncertainty in the age of the recent star formation manifests itself in two distinct ways .",
    "the first is uncertainty measured by the mc analysis performed above , while the second is due to the width of the intrinsic spread of the burst across multiple age bins .",
    "we estimate the latter of these as the difference between the median age and the ages where 16% and 84% of star formation has occurred .",
    "we estimate the former of these as the rms difference between the median age of the best fit and the median ages of sf from the mc tests .",
    "we then add these differences in quadrature to assign a confidence interval to each result .",
    "thus for each progenitor we determine a median age , as well as ( potentially asymmetric ) uncertainties about this median .",
    "finally , we make the assumption that we are unable to determine the age of sf to a greater precision than the age bins in which we have measured this sf .",
    "we thus round the age range to the age of the next isochrone out from the median .",
    "we perform this step for both younger and older star formation , always rounding away from the median .",
    "the ages of these isochrones determine our final uncertainties .    in order to use this method of analysis",
    ", we must define the maximum age of star formation which may produce core - collapse progenitors .",
    "as explained in  4.1 , we use our distribution to estimate a minimum mass for core - collapse between 7.8 and 7.0  m@xmath7 . as a result",
    ", we adopt 50 myr as the maximum age of a core - collapse progenitor and only perform the above mass estimation analysis over the most recent 50 myr of sf .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite models specify a maximum mass for an isochrone at a given age .",
    "more massive stars will have already died off .",
    "thus the isochrones we have identified as bounding our confidence interval can be linked directly to values for @xmath0 .",
    "our value for the median progenitor mass comes from interpolating the final isochrone masses between isochrones to the median age value .",
    "this is necessary because our median age wo nt line up exactly with a defined isochrone .    in fig .",
    "[ massplot ] we plot the @xcite and @xcite isochrones for final isochrone mass vs.  age for metallicities of z = 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.019 , and 0.030 .",
    "the models produce very similar age to mass conversions regardless of the assumed metallicity .",
    "the vast majority of our regions produce best fit metallicities of approximately solar . as a result",
    ", we adopt the z = 0.019 isochrone for mass determinations .",
    "note that masses change very quickly for younger populations , while masses for older populations change at a much slower rate .",
    "this means that our results for less massive progenitors will naturally be more precise .",
    "note that we have neglected systematic uncertainties in the age - to - mass conversion process for our individual progenitor results .",
    "this leads to very small error bars on some progenitor masses , especially those at older ages , where mass does nt change significantly as a function of age .",
    "our mass distributions are not sensitive to this model - dependent systematic uncertainty , as shown by similarity between the median progenitor distribution and the probability distribution ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "however , uncertainties are almost certainly underestimated for some progenitors , especially at the low - mass end . to estimate the magnitude of this systematic uncertainty , we compared the solar metallicity isochrones of @xcite to the @xcite isochrones used for our analysis .",
    "we found that for a @xmath150 myr lifetime star , the @xcite isochrones find a maximum mass of 6.7  m@xmath7 , compared to the 7.3  m@xmath7predicted for the @xcite isochrones . at a lifetime of @xmath122 myr , the youngest stars tested by @xcite , the maximum masses for the different isochrone sets are 9.9  m@xmath7and 10.9  m@xmath7respectively .",
    "these suggest systematic uncertainties of around 0.5 - 1.0  m@xmath7for the age - mass conversion process .",

    "qualitatively , the observed distribution shows a lack of the most massive stars when compared to a salpeter imf ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 ) .",

    "many solutions have been proposed to explain the problem ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "finally , while we assumed our snr catalogs constituted a complete , unbiased sample , the possibility exists that selection effects in the catalogs lead to the lower end of the progenitor mass distribution being sampled more heavily . in particular , extremely massive progenitors are likely associated with strong h ii regions , where identification of snrs is a more difficult observational task .",
    "it is possible snrs of this type are systematically undersampled in the survey .",
    "we attempted to quantify both the imf slope and minimum mass using markov chain monte carlo methods , but found that the data could not produce meaningful constraints beyond those determined by our more simplistic techniques .",
    "we believe the chief reason for this is the size of errors due to differential reddening of the fields .",
    "part of the problem is treatment of differential reddening as a top - hat distribution .",
    "in addition , the inclination of m31 contributes to these high differential extinction values .",
    "the application of this technique to a less inclined galaxy would be of benefit in this respect .",
