    "on july 4th , 2012 , the atlas and cms collaborations of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) announced the discovery of a new particle with a mass of 125 gev @xcite .",
    "the spin and parity properties of the new particle as well as its couplings to standard model ( sm ) particles have been investigated , and proven to be consistent with the prediction of the sm .",
    "the sm has been established as a low energy effective theory that explains phenomena at energy scales below @xmath0 gev .",
    "although the sm is extraordinarily successful , there are still unresolved problems .",
    "the observation of neutrino oscillations reveals that neutrinos must have finite masses and contradicts the sm , where the neutrinos are massless @xcite .",
    "cosmological observations precisely determine the energy density of dark matter in the universe while there is no candidate particle that can fulfill the dark matter abundance in the sm @xcite . from the theoretical viewpoint , in order to explain the observed higgs boson mass in the framework of the sm an unnaturally huge fine - tuning between its bare mass squared and contributions from radiative corrections is required .",
    "we are obliged to construct a more fundamental theory beyond the sm to tackle these difficulties .",
    "the above - mentioned problems are solvable in supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions with right - handed neutrino chiral supermultiplets .",
    "the couplings of the right - handed neutrinos to the left - handed counterparts provide a source of the observed neutrino masses , which are either dirac- or majorana - type .",
    "the hierarchy problem is avoided by introducing susy : the quadratically divergent sm contributions to the higgs boson mass squared are canceled out by those from diagrams involving superparticles whose spins differ from their sm counterparts by half a unit .",
    "it is intriguing that a viable candidate for dark matter other than conventional ones is automatically introduced as a by - product in this framework : the lightest sneutrino which is mainly made of the right - handed component .",
    "when such a sneutrino is the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , the observed dark matter abundance can be explained while satisfying other experimental constraints , in sharp contrast to left - handed sneutrino lsp scenarios which are excluded by the data of direct detection of dark matter .",
    "susy scenarios with dirac neutrinos and large susy breaking sneutrino trilinear parameters can provide a viable sneutrino dark matter candidate .",
    "sneutrino trilinear parameters of the order of other soft susy breaking masses can be naturally realized in models where @xmath1-term susy breaking is responsible for the smallness of the neutrino yukawa couplings and induce large mixings between the left- and right - handed sneutrino states . due to the large sneutrino trilinear coupling",
    ", the lightest mixed sneutrino behaves as a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) and its thermal relic abundance falls in the cosmological dark matter abundance @xcite .",
    "so far , such mixed sneutrino wimp scenarios have been screened in the light of experimental results . if the mixed sneutrino mass is of the order of 100 gev , its thermal relic abundance can account for the observed dark matter abundance without contradicting experimental constraints . on the other hand , when the mass of the mixed sneutrino is smaller than half the mass of the discovered higgs boson , its invisible decay rate is significantly enhanced .",
    "it has been shown that such a light sneutrino dark matter scenario is excluded in the light of the lhc results if the gaugino mass universality is imposed @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the gev - mass mixed sneutrino scenarios without gaugino mass universality .",
    "we show that when the lightest neutralino mass is of the order of the mixed sneutrino mass , the thermal relic abundance of the mixed sneutrino coincides with the observed dark matte abundance . it should be emphasized that the large sneutrino trilinear coupling makes our vacuum unstable .",
    "however , the vacuum stability bound in light mixed sneutrino wimp scenarios has been neglected in earlier works .",
    "we compute the transition rate of our vacuum to a deeper one , and show that the vacuum stability bound is not severe .",
    "although experimental constraints are very tight , there are some regions where mixed sneutrino wimp scenarios are viable .",
    "we show that dark matter allowed regions can be examined by precisely measuring the invisible decay rate of the observed higgs boson at future linear colliders .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sec.ii , the model of the mixed sneutrino dark matter is briefly reviewed .",
    "experimental constraints on the model are summarized in sec.iii . in sec.iv , the vacuum stability bound on our model",
    "is discussed .",
    "sec.v is devoted to a summary .",
    "here , we briefly review the mixed sneutrino model with lepton number conservation , which is proposed in @xcite . in this model , in addition to the usual mssm matter contents , three generations of right - handed neutrinos @xmath2 ( sneutrinos @xmath3 ) are introduced . here , @xmath4 denote the generation . as a result , dirac neutrino yukawa interactions , soft right - handed sneutrino mass terms and soft trilinear couplings among the left - handed slepton doublet @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the higgs doublet with hyper charge @xmath7 , @xmath8 , which gives mass to the up - type quarks and dirac neutrinos are added to the usual mssm lagrangian .",
    "the newly introduced soft terms are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 are soft right - handed sneutrino mass parameters , and @xmath11 are trilinear sneutrino @xmath12-parameters . in order to avoid lepton flavor violation , we have assumed that these soft parameters are diagonal in generation space .",
    "majorana neutrino mass terms and corresponding right - handed sneutrino bilinear terms are prohibited due to lepton number conservation .    neglecting the contribution from the dirac neutrino masses , the sneutrino mass matrix for one generation",
    "is written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the soft mass parameter for the left - handed slepton doublet .",
    "the sum of the squares of the vacuum expectation values and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values are given by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . here , @xmath17",
    "( @xmath18 ) is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs doublet with hypercharge @xmath19 ( @xmath7 ) . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath20 is not suppressed by the smallness of the corresponding neutrino yukawa coupling , but is of the order of other soft parameters .",
    "this large @xmath20 parameter gives a large mixing between the left - handed and right - handed sneutrinos , @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and the sneutrino mixing angle is given by @xmath23 it should be emphasized that the couplings of the lighter sneutrino to the @xmath24-boson , the higgs boson and neutralinos are suppressed by a power of the small mixing angle @xmath25 , compared to those of the mssm left - handed sneutrinos .",
    "the smallness of the sneutrino interactions plays an important role in satisfying experimental constraints as discussed in the next section .",
    "the feynman rules for such sneutrino interactions are given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the electric charge , @xmath28 the @xmath29 coupling constant , @xmath30 the @xmath24-boson mass and @xmath31 the weinberg angle . as for susy parameters , @xmath32 is the higgs mixing angle , and the matrix @xmath33 diagonalizes the neutralino mass matrix .    in the rest of this paper , for simplicity , we focus on the cases where the lighter of the tau sneutrinos is a gev - mass thermal wimp candidate .",
    "we assume that the lighter sneutrinos of the first two generations are too heavy to affect experimental constraints on such gev - mass tau sneutrino wimp scenarios .",
    "thermal wimp candidates have been extensively tested through many experiments . in particular ,",
    "if the wimp is lighter than half of the mass of the higgs boson and interacts with the higgs boson , such light wimp models can be probed also through searches for the invisible decay of the higgs boson .",
    "we list relevant experimental constraints imposed on light tau sneutrino wimp scenarios in table [ tab : expresulte ] , and comment on the constraints below .",
    ".observables and experimental constraints . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the large @xmath34-parameter suppresses the higgsino component of the lightest neutralino .",
    "then , the decay width of the higgs boson to a pair of the lightest neutralinos is suppressed and the branching ratio of the higgs invisible decay can be consistent with the lhc results @xcite . the reference value of @xmath35 is chosen to give the higgs mass 125 gev . the heavier sneutrino mass must be larger than the higgs boson mass in order to suppress the decay width of the higgs boson to a pair of the lighter and heavier sneutrinos . on the other hand , the heavier sneutrino should be light enough , because the sneutrino a - term which triggers the false vacuum decay is proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "the right - handed selectron and smuon are heavier than the next - to - lightest neutralino in order to relax the constraints on the chargino and the neutralino from two- and three - lepton searches at the lhc @xcite . the right - handed stau mass and the wino mass are chosen to be consistent with the results of the two and three tau searches @xcite .",
    "we show the result of the parameter region search in fig .",
    "[ fig : general1 g ] .",
    "( black dotted line ) and @xmath37 ( red line ) on the branching ratio of the higgs invisible decay . , width=377 ]    in the yellow region the relic density of the sneutrino is larger than the dark matter relic density from planck collaboration data @xcite .",
    "the light - red region is excluded by the higgs invisible decay searches at atlas @xcite .",
    "the higgs decays invisibly into a pair of the sneutrinos or the lightest neutralinos in parameter space of our model .",
    "this light - red region will become larger by the searches at future colliders .",
    "the upper limit on the higgs invisible decay branching ratio of @xmath38 constrains the mixing angle @xmath39 up to @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath37 limit can test all the region of the sneutrino mixing angle in the light sneutrino scenarios .",
    "the constraint on dark matter direct detection rates from lux @xcite and supercdms @xcite is not serious in the light mass region . in the allowed region",
    "the spin independent cross section is of the order of @xmath41 .",
    "in supersymmetric models with dirac neutrino masses where soft breaking trilinear sneutrino interactions are not suppressed by small neutrino yukawa couplings , the lightest mixed sneutrino is one of the viable thermal wimp candidates due to the non - negligible mixings between the left- and right - handed states .",
    "we have focused on the cases where the lighter of the mixed tau sneutrinos is a wimp with mass of the order of @xmath42 gev , and investigated phenomenological constraints on such scenarios .",
    "we have shown that if the mass of the bino - like neutralino is also of the order of gev , the dark matter relic abundance can be explained while adequately suppressing the invisible higgs boson decay rate .",
    "this situation could be realized by relaxing gaugino mass universality which , if retained , would have disabled our scenario because of the severe gluino mass bound obtained at the lhc .",
    "special attention has been paid to the vacuum stability bound .",
    "the large trilinear soft breaking sneutrino interaction also makes a lepton number violating vacuum deeper than the mssm - like vacuum . we have computed the relevant euclidean action , and shown that the lifetime of the universe in the current phase is long enough in the allowed regions where the dark matter and higgs invisible decay constraints are satisfied .",
    "although dark matter direct detections can not give stringent constraints on such a low mass wimp , we have shown that the ilc has the ability to explore the allowed region through the higgs invisible decay search if the mass of the mixed tau sneutrino is larger than 0.1 gev .",
    "such light mixed sneutrino scenarios are good examples to show that future linear colliders can explore model parameter regions which other experiments can not probe .",
