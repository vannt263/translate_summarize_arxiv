    "the theory of coherent pair production in crystals requires the following conditions to be respected @xcite :    1 .",
    "the mean angle of particle deflection from the straight line on the formation length @xmath43 should be @xmath44 , where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 is the mass of the electron ) 2 .",

    "it is well known that the main contribution to the process is given by the first harmonic , while the contribution of the 4-th and higher order harmonics is small .",

    "[ fig-2 ] illustrates the behaviour of the total probability of pair production as a function of the entrance angle @xmath37 .",
    "one can see the non - symmetrical curves with respect to the entrance angle . at both energies",
    "the region of orientation where the difference @xmath124 is a measurable quantity is evident .",

    "[ fig-3]b .",
    "the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig-3 ] are valid for particles which were created in the bulk of the crystal ( at the moment of creation ) . after their creation , these particles ( electrons and positrons ) can lose their energy due to coherent radiation processes in the electric fields of the crystal .",
    "however , these processes are relevant only for small angles with respect to the tangency direction @xcite .",
    "hence , one can expect that the particles created at large enough @xmath37 angles have a large probability to conserve their initial energy till their exit from the crystal .",
    "[ fig-4 ] illustrates the behavior of the @xmath126 probability and the @xmath127 asymmetry for different bending radii of the silicon single crystal ( for a ( 110 ) planar orientation ) .",
    "to measure the pair photoproduction probability in a bent crystal , a high energy @xmath0 ray beam is needed which can be created via bremsstrahlung in an amorphous material ( rt , amorphous radiator ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-5 ] which presents a schematic of the possible setup .",
    "+ in this proposed setup , an electron beam of 120  gev is considered ; such a beam has already been characterized in the insurad test at the cern sps h4 beamline where electron and positron beams with energies up to 200  gev are available . the primary electron crosses a pair of silicon microstrip detectors ( s1-s2 ) which determine its trajectory and therefore the approximate direction of the photons which can be generated during the radiator ( rt ) crossing . + a bending magnet placed after the radiator deflects the primary electron beam to avoid the production of other photons in the interaction of the electron beam with the crystal ; considering a magnet of 3  tm",
    ", the primary electron minimum displacement at the end of the magnet is @xmath1281  cm , leaving enough space to place the bent crystal whose transversal dimension is usually of the order of some millimeters .",
    "the bending magnet has the additional task to sweep away the electron - positron pair that can be generated inside the radiator and would constitute a background in the measurement .",
    "the photons produced in the target cross the magnet and impinge on the crystal ( c ) , where an electron - positron pair can be photoproducted . after the crystal a silicon microstrip detector identifies the pair presence and its position before it crosses a second smaller magnet ( m2 , @xmath1280.5  tm ) .",
    "m2 separates the trajectory of the two particles of the pair as a function of their energy so that the s4 silicon microstrip detectors ( acting as a spectrometer together with m2 ) can compute their energy .",
    "the s4 dimensions and position determine the measurable energy range ; a 20  cm detector at 0.5  m from the magnet should allow to measure the secondary particles in the energy range from 1 to 60  gev , thus covering the majority of the high energy photoconverted @xmath0 quanta .",
    "after the magnets ( at around 10  m ) the primary electron and the photons which did nt convert in the crystal have different directions and can be detected by two different calorimeters , c@xmath0 and ce .",
    "the c@xmath0 calorimeter measures the energy of the non converted photons while the energy of the primary electron can be reconstructed with the spectrometer method , using the position information provided by the s5 silicon microstrip detector . the ce calorimeter would be used only for beam monitoring , to measure the purity of the primary beam since it allows to distinguish electrons from muons and negative hadrons , that can be present if the beam is a secondary one , as is the case for the sps leptonic extracted beamline .    in principle , the setup in fig .",
    "[ fig-5 ] should allow to reconstruct the event chain which follows a trigger produced by a primary incoming electron .",
    "the detectors measure the energy of the charged and neutral secondary particles as well as the energy fraction remaining in the primary electron . in this way it is possible to check , on an event by event basis , that the total measured energy corresponds to the initial one .",
    "the setup shown in fig .",
    "[ fig-5 ] allows also the pre - alignment of the crystal , which is performed removing the radiator target and switching the magnets off . in this configuration ,",
    "the two silicon microstrip detectors ( s1-s2 ) are able to measure the incoming angle ( before the crystal ) of the particle while s3 and s4 measure its outgoing angle after the crystal to compute the crystal deflection angle .",
    "since the crystal is mounted on a goniometer , it can be rotated until the channeling and volume reflection effects appear allowing to compute the misalignment between the beam and the crystal itself .    for what concerns the @xmath0 beam characteristics ,",
    "two cases can be considered :    * _ thin radiator _ : the production of more than one photon per incoming electron is improbable , thus the gamma beam intensity and spectral distribution can be measured during the crystal data taking given the fact that the photon energy is either measured using the pair ( when conversion has happened ) or the c@xmath0 calorimeter ( no conversion ) * _ thick radiator _ : statistically more than one photon per incoming electron is produced , but only the total irradiated energy is measured ; the gamma beam intensity and spectral distribution should be inferred through a montecarlo simulation . the advantage of this second configuration is a higher statistics .    finally , the photoproduction probability dependence on the photons linear polarization can be investigated substituting the amorphous radiator with a straight crystal oriented in coherent bremsstrahlung .",
    "this kind of radiator provides a photon beam with a high degree of linear polarization , ranging from 30% to 75% depending on the photon spectral region which is taken into account @xcite .",
    "the linear polarization of the emitted photons is parallel to the electric field of the radiator crystal which in turn depends on its orientation .",
    "therefore , using a goniometer with two degrees of rotational freedom to orient the radiator crystal , it is possible to change the photons linear polarization from a prevalence of w@xmath129 ( the radiator crystal and the bent one are oriented in the same way , fig .",
    "[ fig-6]a ) to w@xmath130 ( the crystals are oriented perpendicularly one with respect to the other , fig .",
    "[ fig-6]b ) . the comparison between the photoproduction probability measured using the photon beam with a prevalence of w@xmath129 photons and w@xmath130 ones allows to measure the photoproduction dependence on the polarization .",
    "this paper shows how high energy photons moving in bent single crystals with large enough bending radii can meet the local conditions for coherent photoproduction .",
    "these conditions are violated only in a small range when the direction of the photon motion is very close to the tangent direction . according to our estimations ( for a ( 110 ) silicon plane , @xmath131  gev and @xmath132  m ) , this area is about @xmath133rad . for photon energies",
    "@xmath1341000  gev , the pair production process is far from these angles .",
    "however , with the increase of the photon energy the first harmonic tends to zero and moving towards the tev range , the character of the photoproduction process will change @xcite .",
    "+ we think that these considerations may be extended to the axial case of bent single crystals .",
    "it should be noted that the considered pair production process in bent crystals analyzed in this paper is similar to the process of radiation emission of over - barrier positrons ( electrons ) experimentally investigated in @xcite .",
    "the comparison with the theoretical predictions in that case was satisfactory .",
    "theory @xcite predicts correctly the range and form of the radiation energy losses spectra but with an intensity 1.7 ( 1.2 ) larger than what experimentally measured for positrons ( electrons ) .",
    "the first calculations were performed on the basis of the quasi classical description which was developed in @xcite . then in @xcite it was demonstrated that for not large energies the theory of coherent bremsstrahlung in a local longitudinal area of the bent crystal could be used to describe radiation emission ( see eq .  ( 13 ) ) .",
    "a similar approach was also proposed in @xcite but without taking into consideration the condition of volume reflection which accounts for the difference in the soft part of the photon spectrum . however , the results presented in all these papers ( for large enough bending radii and not large particle energies ) demonstrate the validity of the coherent bremsstrahlung theory in a local area of the bent crystal . considering the similarity between coherent pair production and bremsstrahlung",
    ", the description presented in this paper can be accounted for .",
    "the pair photoproduction process in bent single crystals may be used to obtain a linearly polarized high energy @xmath0-beam and to determine the degree of linear polarization of such beams . in principle",
    ", there is the possibility of transforming the linear polarization into a circular one @xcite , but this requires further investigation .",
    "the study of this field is interesting due to the new opportunity of searching axion - like particles ( see for example @xcite and literature herein ) , offered by the unique nature of birefringence for light and high energy photons ( the electromagnetic vacuum polarization ) . + another possible field of application of the photoproduction process in bent single crystals is the cleaning of the gamma part of the halos of future electron positron colliders .",
    "in fact , one may expect the electromagnetic cascade in an oriented bent crystal to be significantly shorter than in an amorphous medium .",
    "the use of a multicrystal system could be foreseen for this goal @xcite .",
    "it should be also noted that the probability and asymmetry functions presented in this paper are smoother and broader in angle for bent crystals compared to straight ones ( @xmath11 tends to @xmath135 ) .",
    "for this reason bent crystals are more convenient for the applications described above .",
    "the paper presents also a possible experimental setup to perform the measurements , on the basis of what has already been done for the insurad experiment on the cern sps extracted beamlines .",
