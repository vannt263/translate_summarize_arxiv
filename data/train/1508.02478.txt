    "today more than five thousand different magnetic molecular clusters are known , and about hundred of these show some behaviors that are significant from physics science point of view [ 1 ] .",
    "these molecules are between simple paramagnetic salts and super - paramagnetic particles of sub - micrometer size .",
    "thus , they show phenomena such as hysteresis at molecular level .",
    "some issues in this subject are similar to those that result in the study of magnetization reversal of small magnetic particles , and it is hoped that the molecular systems will offer insights into the future , which has applications in magnetic recording and storage technologies .    the molecule @xmath0 ( proper chemical formula : @xmath1^{8+}$ ] is magnetic , and forms good single crystals.(see fig.1 ) . in its lowest state , it has a total spin of 10 , arising from competing antiferromagnetic interactions between the eight @xmath2 fe ions within a molecule .",
    "spin - orbit and spin - spin interactions destroy complete rotational invariance , and give rise to anisotropy with respect to the crystal lattice directions .",
    "a variety of experimental techniques ( electron spin resonance , ac susceptibility , magnetic relaxation , mossbauer spectroscopy , neutron scattering ) indicates that their data can be fitted by the following model hamiltonian @xmath3 $ ] :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the two components of spin operator , d and e are the anisotropy constants and are known through a variety of experimental evidences with@xmath7 , @xmath8 [ 6 - 7 ] .",
    "the last term of the hamiltonian describes the zeman energy which is associated with an applied field h. this hamiltonian defines hard , and easy axes of magnetization in x and z direction respectively .",
    "magnetization hysteresis are exhibited for this nanocluster below blocking temperature .",
    "fig.2 shows typical hysteresis loops with the field applied along the easy axis of magnetization .",
    "the steps in the loops are clearly visible .",
    "these loops become temperature independent below 0.35 k and demonstrate quantum tunneling at the lowest levels of energy .    hysteresis loops with",
    "the field applied along the easy axis of magnetization.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    hysteresis loops with the field applied along the easy axis of magnetization.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    it suggested that the observed steps in hysteresis loops are due to resonance tunneling between quantum spin states . in calculating only dipole excitations",
    "were considered [ 8 ] and we think that other the excitations , such as multipole excitations are related , and must be considered .    in this paper ,",
    "firstly , periodically dependence of spin tunneling for @xmath0 in su(2 ) group is calculated .",
    "in other word , only dipole excitation in hamiltonian is considered . due to the symmetry and the power of spin operators in hamiltonian and being more accurate ,",
    "other multipole excitations must be considered .",
    "then , in this study we consider both dipole and quadrupole excitations .",
    "instanton method is used to calculate tunneling phenomenon between the ground states .",
    "this method will be described in the next section .",
    "instantons are classical paths that run between degenerating the classical minima of the energy . by classical",
    "we mean that the path obeys the principle of the least action and satisfies energy conservation .",
    "however , a path along which energy is conserved can not run between two minima and can have real coordinates and momenta .",
    "hence , one must enlarge the notion of a classical path and allow the coordinates and/or momenta to become complex .",
    "the instanton method is an efficient way of calculating tunnel splitting , both for particles [ 9 ] and for spin [ 10 ] .",
    "it is based on evaluating the path integral for a certain propagator in the steepest - descent approximation and is designed to be asymptotically correct in the semiclassical limit @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "the tunneling amplitude in this method is given by [ 11 ] :    @xmath11    the pre - factor @xmath12 results from integrating the gaussian fluctuations around the k - th instanton .",
    "for nanocluster @xmath0 , the tunneling amplitude is obtained from the following relation [ 5 ] :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 related to real and imaginary parts of classical action . in this paper , these functions were calculated numerically . because this pre - factor do nt effect on the location of quenching points or steps in hysteresis loops , for simplicity we assume @xmath16 .",
    "we used expectation value of operators @xmath17 in su(2 ) group to obtain classical energy of the system , in other word , in the first case only dipole excitations are considered .",
    "then    @xmath18    by placing these values in hamiltonian ( 1.1 ) obtained :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 .",
    "the minimum of energy is obtained at :    @xmath21    the minima of energy are :    @xmath22    by substituting @xmath23 , the instanton must satisfy the constraint :    @xmath24    solutions for the above equation are :    @xmath25    the above solutions , despite conserving energy , must satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath26 .",
    "these solutions give rise to what a. garg called boundary jump instantons [ 3 ] .",
    "the solution whcih satisfies the above conditions is :    @xmath27    if we consider only dipole excitations , @xmath14 and @xmath15 obtain in the following forms :    @xmath28    we calculated these functions numerically and substituted in relation ( 2.2 ) and tunneling amplitude obtained in the form of fig .",
    "4 . if we plotted function @xmath29 versus magnetic field h , the fig .",
    "3 would be obtain .",

    "if quadrupole excitation is considered , we use spin expectation values in su(3 ) group :    @xmath30    if placing these quantities in hamiltonian ( 1.1 ) , the classical energy would obtain in the following form :    @xmath31    the minimum of energy obtained at :    @xmath32    also minima of energy are : @xmath33    by substituting @xmath23 , the instanton must satisfy the constraint :    @xmath34    solutions for the above equation are : @xmath35 similar to the previous section , solution that has the following form is considered :    @xmath36    amplitude of tunneling versus magnetic field h , in this case both dipole and quadrupole excitations are considered.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    amplitude of tunneling versus magnetic field h , in this case both dipole and quadrupole excitations are considered.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    if we consider both dipole and quadrupole excitations , @xmath14 and @xmath15 will obtain in the following forms :    @xmath37    where two variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 are related to dipole excitations and g and @xmath40 are related to quadrupole excitations .",
    "we calculated this function numerically and substituted them in relation ( 2.2 ) . if we plotted tunnel amplitude and function @xmath29 versus magnetic field h , quenching points in splitting ( fig .",
    "5 ) or steps in hysteresis loop ( fig .",
    "6 ) would be obtained .    as we saw in this plot , the number of quenching points for this nanocluster are equal to the number of steps in hysteresis loop .",
    "in this paper , according to the power of spin operators in hamiltonian , to get the correct number of steps in hysterics loop , we used dipole and quadrupole excitations .    at the beginning ,",
    "only dipole excitation was considered , as we saw in fig .",
    "4 , the numbers of steps in hysterics loop or quenching points in tunnel splitting oscillations are three and this number is less than real one .",
    "if we add quadrupole excitation , this number changes to four , fig .",
