    "astrometry is an essential tool for characterizing directly imaged exoplanets and their physical relationship to other elements of the planetary system in which they reside .",
    "the gemini planet imager ( gpi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was designed with a goal of achieving @xmath21.8  mas astrometric accuracy @xcite , necessary for characterizing the eccentricity distribution of exoplanet orbits from the gpi exoplanet survey @xcite .",
    "to do so , the astrometric calibration of gpi has continually been benchmarked to well - calibrated astrometric fields @xcite .",
    "this had led to some of the most precise astrometry on directly - imaged exoplanet systems to date @xcite , allowing us to constrain or fit the first ever orbit of some of these directly - imaged exoplanets .",
    "however , limited by either the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of these exoplanets or by biases in the various data analysis algorithms , so far no astrometric study with gpi has achieved the design goal of 1.8  mas precision .",
    "the importance of understanding planetary orbits is highlighted by the @xmath0 pictoris system , a young ( @xmath3 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and nearby system that has been extensively studied .",
    "@xmath0 pic harbors a near edge - on debris disk that was first imaged by @xcite and which was subsequently observed to have a warp thought to be induced by a planet whose orbit is inclined relative to the debris disk @xcite .",
    "additional indirect signatures of a planet were derived from variable spectral features modeled as infalling comets @xcite and a peculiar light curve anomaly detected in 1981 @xcite .",
    "@xcite then discovered @xmath0  pic  b , a planet at an appropriate mass ( @xmath4  @xmath5 ) and semi - major axis ( @xmath6  au ) to be responsible for the previously observed indirect signatures of planets .",
    "a key focus of subsequent observations was determining the alignment of @xmath0  pic  b relative to the main outer disk and the warp to determine if @xmath0  pic  b is causing the warp . by observing the disk and planet simultaneously",
    ", @xcite concluded that the planet is misaligned from the main outer disk and consistent with being responsible for the warp .",
    "additionally , @xcite ruled out the possibility of having another giant planet in the system massive enough to cause the warp instead .",
    "thus , @xmath0  pic  b is responsible for the warp in the debris disk .",
    "this was confirmed in astrometric monitoring campaigns @xcite which used homogeneous datasets to limit systematics and constrain the orbit of @xmath0  pic  b.    refining the orbital elements of @xmath0 pic b is not only crucial for investigating the dynamical link between the planet and the disk warp , but also because @xmath0 pic b may transit its host star once every @xmath720 years . to date , there are no other known systems where the physical properties of an exoplanet can be characterized by using both the direct imaging and transit techniques . currently , the tightest constraint on the probability of transit is @xmath70.06% , obtained with a dedicated astrometric monitoring campaign with gpi @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite point out that gpi measurements from @xcite have a higher position angle than astrometry from previous measurements , which could arise from a possible systematic calibration offset between gpi and previous instruments instead of actually due to @xmath0  pic  b s orbit being slightly inclined away from edge on .",
    "we note there currently is no evidence of a position angle offset with the gpi astrometric calibration , and the gpi astrometry of hd 95086 b are consistent with previous astrometry from other instruments @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to more accurately compute the orbit of @xmath0  pic  b because in late 2017 to early 2018 @xcite , it will be at its closest projected separation from the star .",
    "the transit of the planet and/or any circumplanetary material orbiting around it could therefore be detectable .",
    "one of the obstacles in characterizing directly imaged exoplanets is that even with the newest instrumentation , the glare of the host star covers the signal of the planet . in order to subtract the point spread function ( psf ) of the star and",
    "maximize the snr of the planet , observing techniques such as angular differential imaging ( adi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and spectral differential imaging ( sdi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and data reduction algorithms like karhunen - love image projection ( klip ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are used in combination to disentangle the psf of the star from potential astrophysical sources .",
    "however , these techniques distort the planet signal and create data reduction artifacts , which usually are nuisance parameters that need to be calibrated out to obtain unbiased astrometry .",
    "forward modelling effects of observing techniques and data reduction algorithms on the psf of the planet was first done in the context of adi and loci , showing significant improvements in astrometry and photometry for simulated planets @xcite . in similar contexts with adi and loci , @xcite and @xcite used forward modelling to correct for flux loss of exoplanets and the flux and morphology of disks respectively . for classical adi ( cadi )",
    ", @xcite showed that forward modelling techniques can improve the sensitivity of cadi and mitigate biases .",
    "the use of markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) in conjunction with forward modelling was presented in @xcite for reference differential imaging .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced a method , called klip - fm , to analytically forward model the degradation of a faint astrophysical signal that occurs when using least squares - based psf subtraction algorithms such as klip that is also generally applicable to any observing strategy .",
    "additionally , the computation of the forward model with klip - fm is much quicker than negative fake planet injection methods @xcite , as the stellar psf subtraction algorithm , klip , needs only to be run once . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate the advantages of klip - fm for precise astrometry and constraining planetary orbits by applying it to gpi observations of @xmath0  pic  b reduced using klip and adi+sdi . in section [ sec : obs ] , we describe our new astrometry technique , bayesian klip - fm astrometry ( bka ) , in which we forward model the psf of the planet with klip - fm and then use the forward model in a bayesian framework to measure the position of the planet while also modelling the correlated nature of the noise . in section [ sec : valid ] , we validate our technique by fitting an orbit to the data and showing that our astrometry and uncertainties are consistent with keplerian motion with no obvious systematics .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : orbit ] , we apply our new astrometry to constrain the orbit of @xmath0  pic  b and place the tightest constraints yet on the transit of the planet and its hill sphere .",
    "to obtain a large temporal baseline of gpi astrometric points , we compiled gpi data of @xmath0 pic from commissioning ( gemini program gs - eng - gpi - com ) , an astrometric monitoring campaign of @xmath0  pic  b ( gemini programs gs-2015a - q-21 and gs-2015b - q-9 ; pi : graham ) , the gpi exoplanet survey ( gs-2014b - q-500 ; pi : macintosh ) , and a gemini large and long program to characterize debris disks ( gs-2015b - lp-6 : pi : chen ) .",
    "all the data used in the following analysis are listed in table [ table : obs ] .",
    "most of these data were published and analyzed in a previous study characterizing the orbit of @xmath0  pic  b by @xcite .",
    "we have reprocessed those data with the new astrometry methods presented in this paper and combined them with five additional new epochs .",
    "there were three datasets in @xcite that we did not use .",
    "we did not use the polarimetry dataset as there was no instrumental psf obtained with the data to forward model .",
    "the dataset on 2014 march 23 was taken during tests of the adaptive optics ( ao ) system , causing the instrumental psf to be highly varying and making it unsuitable for forward modelling .",
    "the 2015 - 01 - 24 dataset contained artifacts in the construction of the forward model that we could not remove .",
    "we chose not to include the measured astrometry from @xcite for the datasets we omitted in order to maintain homogeneity in astrometric datasets and reduce potential systematic errors .",
    "we also note that in the last dataset taken on 2016 - 01 - 21 , there was saturation on the edge of the occulting mask due to bad seeing .",
    "this affected the forward modelling of @xmath0  pic  b , which was also near the occulting mask so a large portion of the frames taken could not be used in this analysis .",

    "there were no significant changes between the two versions of the gpi drp that impacted the astrometry of @xmath0  pic  b. we used the same data reduction process as in @xcite and will summarize them here .",
    "first , dark subtraction and bad pixel correction were applied to each 2-d image . for earlier datasets",
    "in which cryocooler vibration induced correlated noise on the detector , the frames were `` destriped '' to remove this noise @xcite .",
    "then , we corrected for instrument flexure using an argon arc lamp taken before each sequence to align each individual spectrum for extraction @xcite .",
    "then each 2-d frame was turned into a spectral data cube , corrected for any remaining bad pixels , and corrected for distortion @xcite . for the _",
    "k_-band data , thermal background frames were taken along the sequence .",
    "we constructed thermal background cubes in the same fashion and subtracted them from the _ k_-band data .",
    "to spatially register and photometrically calibrate our data , we used the gpi drp to measure the flux and location of the `` satellite '' spots , which are centered on the occulted star and imprinted with its attenuated spectrum @xcite .",
    "the satellite spot fluxes were used to derive a flux calibration in each spectral channel , which we used when constructing the forward models in section [ sec : fm ] .",
    "the location of the occulted star at each wavelength in each datacube was found using a least squares fit to all of the satellite spots positions and the magnitude of the atmospheric differential refraction .",
    "the occulted star center is used to align all the images together before psf subtraction , and is crucial for determining the astrometry of @xmath0  pic  b relative to its host star .",
    "the precision on the star center is 0.05 pixels ( 0.7  mas ) for satellite spots with signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) @xmath8 20 @xcite , which is certainly the case for all of our data on bright stars like @xmath0 pic .      to subtract the stellar psf from each individual datacube , we used ` pyklip ` @xcite , a python implementation of the klip algorithm .",
    "we used both adi and sdi to decorrelate the stellar psf from the psf of @xmath0  pic  b. as we were only concerned with @xmath0  pic  b , we applied our psf subtraction only on the annulus that included the planet , rather than the full image .",
    "we adjusted three main parameters for the psf subtraction , depending on the dataset .",
    "the first was the number of modes used from the karhunen - love ( kl ) transform to model the stellar psf .",
    "the second was an exclusion criteria for picking reference psfs .",
    "the exclusion criteria is similar to the quantity @xmath9 in @xcite and is defined by the number of pixels that @xmath0  pic  b would move azimuthally and radially in an observing sequence due to adi and sdi .",
    "thirdly , we toggled an @xmath711  pixel wide spatial high - pass filter that was applied to some datasets before psf subtraction .",
    "the high - pass filter was implemented using a gaussian filter in fourier space and the @xmath711  pixel size was chosen to remove low frequency background without significantly distorting any point sources in the image . in general , increasing the number of kl modes , decreasing the exclusion criteria , and applying a high - pass filter improves the subtraction of the stellar psf .",
    "however , taken to the extreme , all three options attenuate signal from the planet .",
    "additionally , for a planet as bright as @xmath0  pic  b , the forward modelling described in section [ sec : fm ] may not be valid when the psf subtraction becomes too aggressive @xcite .",
    "thus , to optimize the signal of the planet while maintaining the validity of the forward modelling , we varied these parameters for each dataset .",
    "as @xmath0  pic  b is bright , in most of the datasets we used an exclusion criteria of 4 pixels , which is slightly greater than 1  @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the wavelength and @xmath12 is the diameter of the telescope . when there was little field rotation for adi , we decreased the exclusion criteria to not overly restrict our reference psfs , but also decreased the number of kl modes used to avoid being too aggressive",
    "when the speckle noise was too bright due to observing at a shorter wavelength or when the planet moved closer to the star , we applied a high pass filter to remove some of the diffracted starlight .",
    "we list the chosen parameters for each dataset in table [ table : obs ] .",
    "after psf subtraction , all images were rotated so that north is up and east is left .",
    "then , all the frames were mean combined in both the spectral and temporal directions , resulting in a single psf - subtracted frame for each dataset .",
    "after stellar psf subtraction , the psf of the planet is distorted by over - subtraction , caused by the presence of the planet in the data we are subtracting , and self - subtraction , caused by the presence of the planet in the reference images . over and self - subtraction perturbs the astrometric and photometric properties of the planet s psf and prevents a straightforward measurement of its position .",
    "typically , the biases and uncertainties in the astrometry caused by stellar psf subtraction are estimated by injecting fake planets into the data at other position angles and comparing the retrieved position to the injected position .",
    "however , the over - subtraction and self - subtraction that distorts the planet psf is deterministically caused by the existence of a planet in the data and its apparent motion in the reference images induced by adi and sdi . in turn , these features , if modeled , can inform us about the location of the planet and improve our astrometric precision and accuracy .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced klip - fm , an analytic framework to compute the effect of a planet on the kl modes and use these perturbations to reconstruct the over - subtraction and self - subtraction features . using this technique , we are able to generate the psf of the planet after psf subtraction ( see appendix [ appendix : fmpsf ] for a detailed description of the procedure ) .",
    "briefly , we use the psf of the planet before psf subtraction , the apparent motion of the planet due to adi and sdi , and a model of the planet spectrum to compute the distorted psf of the planet after psf subtraction .",
    "the result is a 2-d broadband planet psf , which we call @xmath13 , centered at ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , our initial estimate for the location of the planet .    for our gpi data ,",
    "the forward models were generated using the implementation of klip - fm in ` pyklip ` .",
    "for each dataset , we used the same parameters as our psf subtraction to construct the forward model . to construct a model of the instrumental psf at each wavelength",
    ", we used the average psf of the satellite spots across all images for that wavelength .",
    "we used a basic center of light centroiding routine to measuring an approximate @xmath16 and @xmath17 positions of the planet ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) in the psf subtracted image .",
    "this initial estimate for the position is good to within a pixel for our gpi data . for the input planet spectrum of the forward model",
    ", we used the normalized best - fit model spectrum from @xcite , which has an effective temperature of 1650  k and a @xmath18 ( cgs units ) .",
    "we scaled the spectrum by eye to approximately match the contrast of @xmath0  pic  b in our data and used the satellite spot fluxes to convert from contrast to digital numbers .",
    "we found that varying the spectrum and photometry had negligible impacts on our measured astrometry .",
    "even a spectrum differing by @xmath725% in shape changed the astrometry by @xmath19  mas , significantly smaller than the uncertainties we find in the following analysis .    with this input information , we used ` pyklip ` to generate one forward modeled psf , @xmath13 , for each dataset . in figure",
    "[ fig : data - fm - compare ] , we show an example forward modeled psf ( not optmized to fit the data ) and comparison to data for our 2014 november 18 dataset on @xmath0  pic  b. qualitatively , the forward model matches all the features seen in data , including the prominent negative self - subtraction lobes on either side of the planet . as ` pyklip ` parallelizes the computation , the generation of the forward models is quick . on a 32-core machine with amd",
    "opteron 6378 processors clocked at 2.3  ghz , forward models for all 37 channels of a representative 37-cube gpi dataset were generated in 15 minutes : 4 minutes of overheads for preprocessing and generating the instrumental psfs and 11 minutes to execute klip - fm and create the forward model .",
    "we note that we chose to run the forward model on a large annulus to examine noise properties in the data and that the computation time for klip - fm decreases @xmath720 - 30% if a small sector around the planet was used instead .",
    "to use the forward modeled psf , @xmath13 , to perform astrometry , we developed a bayesian framework to fit @xmath13 to the data , account for correlated noise , and estimate our fitting uncertainties .",
    "first , ignoring the correlated noise , we can use three parameters to fit the forward model to the data : the location on the planet in @xmath16 ( @xmath20 ) , the location of the planet in @xmath17 ( @xmath21 ) , and a scale factor ( @xmath22 ) to match the flux of @xmath13 to the data .",
    "we can then write the posterior probability for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 given the data @xmath12 using bayes theorem as @xmath23 ignoring normalization constants .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side is the likelihood and the second is the prior .    to construct the likelihood",
    ", we must first use our input parameters and @xmath13 to generate a model to compare to the data .",
    "we scale @xmath13 by @xmath22 and recenter it from its guessed location ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) to ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) . the residual , @xmath24 , between the model and the data , @xmath12 , in fitting region @xmath25 is calculated by @xmath26 where fitting region @xmath25 is a fixed rectangular box centered at the approximate location of the planet in the data .",
    "we pick the size of the fitting region to be a few @xmath10 to encompass the psf and the self - subtraction wings .",
    "we varied the fitting box size for each of our datasets in order to keep the fit focused on the area where signal from the planet can be seen .",
    "we list the size of the fitting box for each dataset in table [ table : obs ] .",
    "note that we do not fit any background term to the image , as one of the first steps of klip is to subtract off the mean of the image , removing any spatially constant background .    for data with uncorrelated errors ,",
    "the log of the likelihood function of the data for a particular model is @xmath27 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the uncertainty in pixel i and @xmath29 is the number of pixels in the fitting region .",
    "however , the assumption of uncorrelated errors does not hold for images limited by speckle noise . except in the cases of very aggressive psf subtraction or at much greater separations from the star , the residual noise after psf subtraction in gpi data of a bright star like @xmath0 pic",
    "is still dominated by correlated speckle noise , which has a correlation scale that depends on the aggressiveness of the psf subtraction . due to the bright nature of @xmath0 pic b , we could not use a very aggressive reduction to ensure that the planet remained a perturbation on our kl modes , thereby preserving the validity of the analytical forward modelling technique .",
    "the conservative psf subtraction combined with the close separation of @xmath0  pic  b from its bright host star required us to capture the correlated nature of the noise .",
    "we thus write our likelihood function instead as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the covariance matrix of size @xmath32 and @xmath24 is a @xmath33 matrix .",
    "we applied a gaussian process framework to characterize the covariance in the noise ( see @xcite for an in - depth explanation of the application of gaussian processes to astronomical data ) .",
    "we only aim to model the correlations within each individual speckle , which spans @xmath10 in spatial extent . while in a single unprocessed frame speckle noise",
    "also has addition correlations on much larger scales , there are no significant correlations between speckles at larger spatial scales in our small fitting region due to stellar psf subtraction with klip and averaging uncorrelated speckles together when collapsing the frames in our adi+sdi sequence .",
    "thus , within our fitting region , the dominant correlation in our noise is from pixels within a single speckle , and thus is the one correlation we modelled .",
    "following the procedure in @xcite for fitting 1-d correlations in stellar spectra , we used the matrn covariance function parametrized with @xmath34 to model the correlated speckle noise .",
    "we chose the matrn function with @xmath34 as it better fits the correlations at larger separations compared to a simple squared exponential relation .",
    "however , we note that switching between covariance functions that have similar shapes does not significantly alter the error bars .",
    "we also chose to assume symmetric noise as we did not find any difference in the correlation scale of our noise in the radial and azimuthal directions .",
    "this is likely be due to the fact that we used both adi and sdi to model the stellar psf and thus are better at subtracting speckle noise , which before psf subtraction is more correlated radially than azimuthally due to the finite spectral bandwidth of the data . in instruments that are not able to utilize sdi , it might be necessary to separate the noise into radial and azimuthal components , each with its own characteristic correlation length . thus for our purposes , we chose the symmetric matrn covariance function with @xmath34 , which defines the covariance between two pixels @xmath35 and @xmath36 separated by a distance of @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath28 and @xmath39 are the uncertainties for each pixel and @xmath40 is a characteristic correlation length scale that increases when noise is correlated at larger spatial scales .",
    "we calculated the uncertainty for each pixel by computing the standard deviation of pixels in an annulus with a width of @xmath41 ( 6  pixels ) , centered on the star , and with a mean radius equal to the distance between that pixel and the star .",
    "any pixels containing signal from the planet were masked and not used in estimating the noise in the annulus .",
    "the correlation length @xmath40 is not fixed , but rather kept as a hyperparameter parameter in our bayesian framework that we will marginalize over in the end .",
    "thus the final posterior we are trying to calculate is really @xmath42 where @xmath22 and @xmath40 are both hyperparameters as we are only interested in the astrometry .    compared to our likelihood function ,",
    "our prior is relatively straightforward .",
    "we allow for uniform priors in @xmath16 and @xmath17 within 2 pixels from our initial guess location .",
    "similarly , we allow for an uniform prior between 0 and 5 for @xmath22 to determine how much to scale @xmath13 , which was already scaled to an approximate contrast of @xmath0  pic  b. the correlation length @xmath40 has a uniform prior between 0 and 10 pixels , which provides an ample range to explore the correlations within individual speckles of size @xmath43  pixels .",
    "we used the @xcite affine invariant mcmc sampler implemented in the ` emcee ` python package @xcite to sample the posterior distribution and custom ` cython ` code to quickly generate the covariance matrix as we vary @xmath40 .",
    "the mcmc sampler was run for 800 steps using 100 walkers , with a `` burn - in '' of 200 steps beforehand . in figure",
    "[ fig : astrom - tri ] , we show the posterior distributions from the mcmc fit for the 2014 november 18 _ h_-band dataset as a representative posterior distribution .",
    "the value of @xmath40 is close to @xmath44  pixels , indicating we are accurately fitting the correlated speckle noise .",
    "we use the resulting posterior distributions to calculate the most - likely values and uncertainties for the location of @xmath0  pic  b in our image at each epoch .    to convert our results to more useful physical values , we need to convert our measured location of @xmath0  pic  b to its positional offset from its host star in right ascension ( ra ) and declination ( dec ) . as our images",
    "are already rotated so that @xmath45 is positive ra and @xmath46 is positive dec , it is straightforward to convert from image fates to sky coordinates .",
    "we use the satellite spots to measure the location of the star behind the coronagraph , which has a precision of 0.7  mas @xcite .",
    "this allows us to derive the separation of the planet from the star in pixels . to convert from pixel separations to physical separations in ra and dec",
    ", we use the most - recent astrometric calibration numbers from @xcite : a plate scale of @xmath47 mas  lenslet@xmath48 and a residual north angle offset of @xmath49 from the north angle value used in the gpi drp ( versions 1.2.1 to 1.3 , the current version ) .",
    "these astrometric calibration numbers show no significant change over time , so we apply them to all our epochs of data .",
    "then , we assume all of these error terms are uncorrelated and add them in quadrature with our measurement errors from our mcmc fit to determine our full astrometric precision .",
    "the combination of the forward modeled psf and the bayesian framework makes up the bayesian klip - fm astrometry technique we introduce in this work .",
    "we apply bka for all twelve gpi datasets and report the measured astrometry and error budgets in table [ table : astrometry ] .",
    "the best fit forward models and residuals to the fit are shown in appendix [ appendix : res ] .",
    "on most of our datasets , we are not limited just by the uncertainty in the location of the planet , which was as low as 0.3  mas .",
    "the uncertainties in the location of the star and north angle also make significant contributions to the error budget .",
    "typically , we achieved @xmath71  mas precision on the relative astrometry between @xmath0  pic  b and its host star .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath724 improvement over previous techniques @xcite using the same data , indicating this technique can be useful in reanalysis of archival data to obtain better astrometry in cases where the limiting factor is the uncertainty on the planet position . in two of the later datasets where",
    "the planet is observed closer in , we were limited by the snr of the planet and unable to achieve 1  mas precision . in the 2015 december 5 dataset ,",
    "the noise was higher due to the planet being fainter relative to the star in _ j_-band . in the 2016 january 21 dataset , a combination of poor seeing and a small amount of usable data limited our astrometric precision .",
    "overall though , this gpi @xmath0  pic  b data is an excellent demonstration for bayesian klip - fm astrometry as the planet is bright enough that the extended psf features , such as the negative self - subtraction lobes , are clearly seen and provide significant information to constrain the position of the planet . for fainter planets ,",
    "the extended features are harder to distinguish from the noise .",
    "as one of the main advantages of bka over techniques that do not forward model the psf is being able to forward model the extended self - subtraction lobes , the astrometric improvement would not be as large for lower signal - to - noise ratio planets .",

    "however , biases and improperly estimated errors would cause it to deviate from unity . due to systematic astrometric calibration offsets between instruments that have not been characterized",

    "for example , @xcite reported a @xmath73 of @xmath74 when combining gpi astrometry , measured using standard techniques in the field , with previous astrometric measurements    even with @xmath724 times smaller error bars on the gpi points , the @xmath73 of our accepted orbits is @xmath75 , unchanged from the @xmath74 reported in @xcite . with bka contributing twelve out of the thirty astrometry measurements ,",

    "as we do not expect the planet s position to change significantly in the span of a single day , the three measurements in november of 2013 and the three measurements in december of 2013 ought to be consistent with each other . indeed",
    ", our measurements in table [ table : astrometry ] indicate that in both sets of astrometry , the measurements agree at the milliarcsecond level , confirming that our estimated uncertainties are accurate .",

    "having demonstrated the accuracy and precision of this new technique , we now analyze the new constraints on the orbit of @xmath0  pic  b. not surprisingly , the estimates for @xmath55 and @xmath66 have not changed significantly from @xcite since the gpi points reanalyzed in this paper do not have a sufficiently long time baseline to constrain these parameters .",

    "we have ruled out the possibility that @xmath0  pic  b will transit at 10-@xmath1 significance .",

    "it is not certain what will be seen when the hill sphere of @xmath0  pic  b transits the star .",

    "another possibility is that , as @xmath0  pic  b is still young and evolving , it may harbor a circumplanetary disk or ring system comprised of leftover material from planet formation .",
    "such a hypothesis is not unprecedented as @xcite found evidence for a large circumplanetary disk around an unseen planet in the 1swasp  j140747.93 - 394542.6 ( hereafter j1407 ) system , which has a similar age ( @xmath716 myr ; * ? ? ? * ) and thus likely at a similar stage in its evolution .",
    "@xcite interpreted the series of complex and deep eclipses in the j1407 lightcurve as from a circumplanetary disk 0.6  au in radial extent in the process of forming rings due to newly formed satellites .",
    "it is plausible that @xmath0  pic  b can harbor a similar disk as a 0.6  au disk would be @xmath72 @xmath93 in extent and consistent with where we would expect stable orbits to reside around @xmath0  pic  b. additionally , since @xmath0  pic  b is young , it is plausible that there is a large amount of circumplanetary material which has yet to be cleared out dynamically .",
    "such a large disk would transit the star and be suitable for detection through photometric monitoring of the host star if the disk is inclined by @xmath101 with respect to the orbital plane of @xmath0  pic  b. to maintain such an inclination , the disk needs to be massive enough to prevent stellar tidal forces from aligning the disk to the orbital plane @xcite .",
    "so far , there have not been many observational constraints of circumplanetary material around @xmath0  pic  b. @xcite reported a photometric event in 1981 and hypothesized it could be due to the transit of a planet that cleared out a hole in the debris disk around its hill sphere .",

    "additionally , a circumplanetary disk or ring may also be detectable through the planet s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the planet s near - infrared spectrum would experience extinction if the dust resides between us and the planet , with the magnitude of extinction depending on the amount of dust . in the near infrared , the extinction would be greater at shorter wavelengths due to the increased scattering and absorption by dust and would produce a spectral slope in the planet s near - infrared sed .",
    "dust around the planet would also scatter starlight , causing the planet s sed to appear brighter in the optical , as has been postulated for fomalhaut b @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dust will produce millimeter emission .",

    ", this psf cube can be used to retrieve spectral information from the data , but it is outside of the scope of this paper . for our astrometry purposes , we also take the mean in wavelength , generating a single 2-d forward modeled psf , which we call @xmath13 , for each dataset .",
    "in figure [ fig : astrometry_residuals ] , we plot the residuals to the best fit model for each epoch using bka .",
    "as @xmath0  pic  b moves closer to its host star , the magnitude of speckle noise increases relative to the signal of @xmath0  pic  b. this is especially true in the last epoch when @xmath0  pic  b was closest to its star .",
    "however , the fit was still accurate as the bright positive core of the psf of the planet was successfully modeled and not seen in the residuals , which are consistent with noise .",

    "<S> a principal scientific goal of the gemini planet imager ( gpi ) is obtaining milliarcsecond astrometry to constrain exoplanet orbits . </S>",
    "<S> however , astrometry of directly imaged exoplanets is subject to biases , systematic errors , and speckle noise . </S>",
    "<S> here we describe an analytical procedure to forward model the signal of an exoplanet that accounts for both the observing strategy ( angular and spectral differential imaging ) and the data reduction method ( karhunen - love image projection algorithm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use this forward model to measure the position of an exoplanet in a bayesian framework employing gaussian processes and markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) to account for correlated noise . in the case of gpi data on @xmath0 pic b , </S>",
    "<S> this technique , which we call bayesian klip - fm astrometry ( bka ) , outperforms previous techniques and yields 1@xmath1-errors at or below the one milliarcsecond level . </S>",
    "<S> we validate bka by fitting a keplerian orbit to twelve gpi observations along with previous astrometry from other instruments . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical properties of the residuals confirm that bka is accurate and correctly estimates astrometric errors . </S>",
    "<S> our constraints on the orbit of @xmath0 pic b firmly rule out the possibility of a transit of the planet at 10-@xmath1 significance . </S>",
    "<S> however , we confirm that the hill sphere of @xmath0 pic b will transit , giving us a rare chance to probe the circumplanetary environment of a young , evolving exoplanet . </S>",
    "<S> we provide an ephemeris for photometric monitoring of the hill sphere transit event , which will begin at the start of april in 2017 and finish at the end of january in 2018 . </S>"
