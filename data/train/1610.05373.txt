    "the enormous radiative and mechanical luminosities of massive stars impact a vast range of scales and processes , from reionization of the universe , to galaxy evolution , to regulation of the interstellar medium , to formation of star clusters , and even to formation of planets around stars in such clusters .",
    "furthermore , synthesis and dispersal of heavy elements by massive stars play key roles in the chemical evolution of the cosmos . in spite of this importance",
    ", there is still no consensus on the basic formation mechanism of massive stars .",
    "theories range from core accretion models , i.e. , scaled - up versions of low - mass star formation ( e.g. , the turbulent core model of mckee & tan 2002 ; 2003 [ hereafter mt03 ] ) , to competitive accretion models at the crowded centers of forming star clusters ( bonnell et al .",
    "2001 ; wang et al .",
    "2010 ) , to stellar collisions ( bonnell et al . 1998 ; bally & zinnecker 2005 ) .",
    "this confusion is due in part to the typically large distances ( @xmath10kpc ) and extinctions to massive protostars ( see , e.g. , tan et al .",
    "2014 for a review ) .",
    "massive stars are observed to form in dense gas clumps with mass surface densities of @xmath11 ( i.e. , @xmath12  mag ; @xmath13  mag ; @xmath14  mag ; adopting the opacities of the moderately coagulated thin ice mantle dust model of ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) .",
    "if massive cores are in approximate pressure and virial equilibrium with this clump ( mt03 ) , then such a core with mass @xmath15 has radius @xmath16  pc .",
    "if the degree of rotational support is similar to low - mass cores , then the disk size should be @xmath17@xmath18au in radius .",
    "the accretion rate is expected to be a few  @xmath19 .",
    "collimated bipolar outflows are observed from massive protostars ( e.g. , beuther et al .",
    "2002 ) and massive early - stage cores ( tan et al .",
    "these are thought to be accretion powered , driven by rotating magnetic fields that are coupled to the accretion disk and/or the protostar leading to disk winds ( e.g. , knigl & pudritz 2000 ) or x - winds ( shu et al . 2000 ) , respectively .",
    "such protostellar outflows are expected to limit the star formation efficiency from a core to @xmath20 ( matzner & mckee 2000 ; zhang , tan & hosokawa 2014 , hereafter zth14 ; kuiper , yorke & turner 2015 ) , since they expel core material from polar directions .",
    "creation of low - density outflow cavities is expected to have a profound effect on the mid - infrared ( mir ) appearance of massive protostars ( de buizer 2006 ) .",
    "radiative transfer calculations of the mt03 core accretion model of massive protostars ( a single protostar in an individual core ) have confirmed the importance of these cavities on the mir to fir images and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) ( zhang & tan 2011 ; zhang , tan & mckee 2013 , hereafter ztm13 ; zth14 ; zhang & tan , in prep . ) .",
    "shorter wavelength light tends to emerge along the outflow cavity that is directed towards our line of sight , i.e. , the near - facing , blue - shifted side of the outflow . at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths the appearance of the protostars is typically dominated by scattered light escaping from the cavities .",
    "moving to mir wavelengths , especially @xmath21 , thermal emission from warm dust in the outflow and outflow cavity walls makes the dominant contribution .",
    "the far - facing outflow cavity appears much fainter because of absorption by the dense , colder dusty material in the core envelope .",
    "however , as one observes at longer wavelengths ( e.g. , @xmath22 ) , the optical depth is reduced , the far - facing outflow cavity becomes more visible and the appearance of the protostar ( i.e. , the intensity profile along its outflow axis ) becomes more symmetric .",
    "the _ stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy _ ( _ sofia _ )",
    "forcast instrument has the ability to observe from mir wavelengths up to @xmath2340@xmath24 with @xmath253@xmath26 angular resolution .",
    "it is thus able to test the above key predictions of core accretion models of massive star formation , i.e. , their mir morphologies should be aligned with outflow cavities and that at longer wavelengths the far - facing cavity should become visible as the overall appearance becomes more symmetric .",
    "sofia_-forcast early science observations of the massive protostar g35.20 - 0.74 for such a test of the models ( zhang et al .",
    "the observations at @xmath27 were able to achieve a high dynamic range in flux brightness sensitivity of a factor of @xmath28 and clearly detected the fainter far - facing outflow cavity at both 31 and 37@xmath24 .",
    "detailed modeling of the multi - wavelength intensity profiles along the outflow axis , together with the sed , provided the following constraints on the properties of the massive protostar , assuming it is the single dominant source of luminosity : a current stellar mass of @xmath29 , embedded in a core with @xmath30 , in a clump with @xmath31 .",
    "this work has motivated observations of a larger sample of protostars , i.e. , the _ sofia _ massive ( soma ) star formation survey ( pi : tan ) . the goal is to observe at least @xmath2350 protostars spanning a range of environments , evolutionary stages and core masses .",
    "we have defined four types of sources : type i : `` mir sources in irdcs '' - relatively isolated sources in infrared dark clouds , some without detected radio emission ; type ii : `` hyper - compact '' - often jet - like , radio sources , where the mir emission extends beyond the observed radio emission ( e.g. , g35.20 - 0.74 ) ; type iii : `` ultra - compact '' - radio sources where the radio emission is more extended than the mir emission ; type iv : `` clustered sources '' - a mir source exhibiting radio emission is surrounded by several other mir sources within @xmath2360@xmath26 .",
    "such classification is somewhat arbitrary , e.g. , depending on the sensitivity of the mir or radio continuum observations , but an evolutionary sequence is expected to hold from types i to iii . a theoretical calculation of the radio continuum emission from the early phases of ionization , i.e. , of a disk wind outflow , has been presented by tanaka , tan & zhang ( 2016 ) .",
    "source selection for the soma survey mainly utilized the cornish survey of cm continuum emission ( hoare et al .",
    "2012 ) , complemented by radio - quiet mir sources in irdcs studied by butler & tan ( 2012 ) and protostars studied at @xmath32 by de wit et al .",
    "we included some non - galactic plane sources and attempted , where possible , to have a relatively spread - out distribution on the sky , which aids scheduling of _ sofia _ observations .    in this first paper of the soma survey we present the results of the first eight sources ( including g35.20 - 0.74 ) , which were observed up to the end of 2014 .",
    "these are all type ii sources .",
    "our goal here is to present the survey data , including public release of the calibrated images , of these eight sources .",
    "we will use these sources to further test the hypothesis that the appearance of the mir morphologies of massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) may be influenced by outflows .",
    "we will also measure the seds of the sources and derive fitting solutions from radiative transfer models , especially the zhang , tan et al .",
    "series ( hereafter the zt models ) that were specifically developed for massive protostars .",
    "we will also compare the results of fitting with the more general , commonly used robitaille et al .",
    "( 2007 ) radiative transfer models .",
    "future papers will carry out more detailed analyses of images , including outflow axis intensity profiles , as well as presenting data for additional sources .",

    "the accretion disk is always assumed to have a mass that is @xmath137 of @xmath84 . these models ( and those of robitaille et al .",
    ", discussed below ) are all for a single protostar within a core . note that even if observed cores are shown to contain multiple sources , that approximation may still be reasonable if the primary source dominates the luminosity of the system .",
    "in general the best model fits yield protostellar masses @xmath13830@xmath3 accreting at rates of @xmath139@xmath140 inside cores of initial masses @xmath141500@xmath3 embedded in clumps with mass surface densities @xmath1423@xmath143 .",

    "can also be a significant variation in all model parameters .",
    "considering as an example the case of g35.20 - 0.74 , our best fit model has @xmath144 accreting at a rate of @xmath145 inside a core of initial mass @xmath146 embedded in a clump environment with mass surface density @xmath147 .",
    "this implies the original core had a radius of 0.045  pc .",
    "the foreground extinction has @xmath148  mag and the angle between the line of sight and the outflow axis is 29@xmath119 . in this model",
    "the protostar is at a relatively early stage of formation , so the lateral opening angle of its outflow cavity is quite narrow , i.e. , 18@xmath119 .",
    "this is quite similar to the morphology shown by the high resolution 11 and 18@xmath24 images of the source presented by de buizer ( 2006 ; see also zhang et al .",
    "2013b ) . inspecting the model fit in figure  [ fig : sedszt ] , we notice it underpredicts at long wavelengths , but that the data here are quite uncertain because of background subtraction .",
    "the peak of the model sed is close to 70@xmath24 , but rises about a factor of 1.7 above the observed _ herschel _ flux at this wavelength .",
    "improved model fits are likely to be possible , by running a finer grid of models , and also by using image profile information ( e.g. , see zhang et al .",
    "2013b ) , and we will investigate such improvements in a future paper .",
    "if no background subtraction is done when constructing the sed , then derived core envelope masses typically increase , as expected .",
    "however , in the case of g35.20 - 0.74 the best fit model has the same values of @xmath15 , @xmath134 and @xmath84 , although @xmath133 approximately doubles . using the variable aperture method ( recall this",
    "is only done at wavelengths @xmath149 ) makes almost no appreciable difference in the fitting results with the zt models .      in figure",
    "[ fig : sedsrob ] we show the results of fitting the robitaille et al .",
    "( 2007 ) models to the fiducial seds .",
    "the parameters of the best five models are also shown in the right side of table  [ tab : models ] .",
    "the values of @xmath133 for the robitaille et al .",
    "models tend to be smaller than those for the zt models .",
    "we expect that this is probably mostly because of the larger number of models being sampled in the robitaille et al . grid . with these models",
    "we generally find slightly higher protostellar masses , but with much lower disk accretion rates : typically @xmath9 smaller . in some cases , the models do not require any disk component ( indicated by `` ... '' in the tabulated accretion rates ) .",
    "the envelope infall rate is always much larger than the disk accretion rate , so the models are not physically self - consistent , at least in the context of having a steadily accreting system .",
    "the outer core envelope radii can also be quite large .",
    "for the distant source g45.47 + 0.05 this is ( @xmath150au ) , which is only marginally smaller than the fixed aperture size ( @xmath151au ) .",
    "however , for the other sources the envelope outer radius is larger than the fixed aperture size ( the outer radius is @xmath150au for all sources except iras 07299 - 1651 and ngc  7538 , which have size between @xmath28@xmath150au ) .",
    "thus most of these models are not internally self - consistent with the observations .    considering the particular case of g35.20 - 0.74",
    "is again instructive . as with the zt models , the best fit robitaille et al .",
    "models underpredict at long wavelengths and ( slightly ) overpredict near the peak of the sed .",
    "a protostellar mass of @xmath152 is estimated , but with a disk accretion rate of only @xmath153 ( so accretion power is negligible ) .",
    "on the other hand , the envelope mass infall rate is @xmath154 .",
    "the viewing angle is found to be 87@xmath119 , so that the outflow axis would be close to the plane of the sky , which is very different from the result of the best zt model .",
    "such a geometry would not be expected to lead to strong asymmetries in the mir / fir morphologies of the blue and redshifted outflow cavities .",
    "the above considerations illustrate some of the difficulties and uncertainties of determining protostellar properties from simple sed fitting methods .",
    "we consider the results of the zt model fitting to be more reliable since the models are designed with the typical expected properties of massive protostars in mind and they yield results that are internally self - consistent both physically ( i.e. , accretion rates through the disk are directly related to infall rates in the core envelopes ; such high disk accretion rates are likely to be needed to drive powerful outflows ) and observationally ( i.e. , the cores are more compact and are generally a better match to the aperture sizes used to define the seds ) .    future work can help test the models further .",
    "for example , the estimated disk accretion rates can be compared with observed mass outflow rates to see if they are consistent with theoretical models of disk winds and/or x - winds .",
    "the model and observed image intensity profiles along and transverse to the outflow axis can be compared to better constrain outflow opening angle and orientation ( i.e. , @xmath135 ) .",
    "the latter can also be compared to that estimated from a study of the kinematics of the outflowing gas .",
    "predictions for internal density and temperature structures within the core can be tested with higher angular resolution observations , especially of sub - mm / mm dust continuum ( e.g. , beuther et al . 2013 ) and with specific temperature diagnostics such as @xmath155 inversion transitions ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "kinematics of core envelope infall ( e.g. , wyrowski et al . 2016 ) and disk rotation ( e.g. , snchez - monge et al . 2013 ) can also be probed with molecular lines .",
    "magnetic field structures around the protostars can be inferred from observations of polarized dust continuum emission ( e.g. , girart et al .",
    "2009 ; zhang et al .",
    "the density and temperature structures of the radiative transfer models , along with their evolutionary histories , provide a framework for developing and testing astrochemical models of core envelopes , disks and outflows ( e.g. , doty et al . 2005 ; drozdovskaya et al .",
    "2014 ; zhang & tan 2015 ) .",
    "radio continuum emission tracing , e.g. , photoionized gas can be searched for ( e.g. , rosero et al .",
    "2016 ) and compared to theoretical predictions ( e.g. , tanaka et al .",
    "2016 ) .    by eventually studying a large sample of protostars spanning a range of environments , masses and evolutionary stages , we hope to discern general trends in star formation activity .",
    "for example , do protostars in higher @xmath134 clump environments have higher accretion rates or even different accretion mechanisms ? are there systematic trends in sed shape with clump environment , core mass , protostellar mass or luminosity ?    as a first step in such directions , in figure  [ fig : lbol ] we show the bolometric luminosity spectral energy distributions of the eight protostars , i.e. , the @xmath156 seds have been scaled by @xmath157 , so that the height of the curves gives an indication of the luminosity of the sources , assuming isotropic emission .",
    "this figure allows one to visualize the range in luminosities present in the sample , along with any potential trends in sed shape .",
    "however , on inspecting the distributions , we do not perceive any obvious trends in sed shape with luminosity , although this is perhaps not so surprising given the current sample size .",
    "we can compare the ordering of the vertical height of these distributions with the rank ordering of the predicted true luminosity of the protostars from the best fit zt models ( the legend in fig .",
    "[ fig : lbol ] lists the sources in order of decreasing zt model luminosity ) .",
    "there is some , but not perfect , correspondence with the flux ordering seen in the figure .",
    "differences are most likely due to varying levels of foreground extinction and anisotropic beaming ( i.e. , the `` flashlight effect , '' yorke & bodenheimer 1999 ) .",
    "such non - intrinsic effects illustrate the need for larger samples of protostars , i.e. , eventually statistically significant samples will be required as a function of environment , mass and evolutionary stage .",
    "this is the eventual goal of the soma survey .",
    "we have presented an overview and first results of the soma star formation survey .",
    "the survey s scientific rationale is to test predictions of core accretion models of massive star formation , specifically the mir to fir thermal emission , including the influence of outflow cavities .",
    "we have presented results for the first eight sources observed in the survey . these tend to show extended mir and fir emission that aligns with known outflows , and being brighter on the near - facing , blue - shifted side , which are predictions of core accretion models that involve high mass surface density cores .",
    "global seds have been constructed and effects of choices of aperture definition and background subtraction investigated .",
    "our fiducial method is an sed derived from a fixed aperture and including an estimate of background subtraction , i.e. , the emission from the surrounding clump environment .",
    "these seds have been used to constrain properties of the protostars by comparison with theoretical radiative transfer models of massive star formation via the turbulent core accretion model .",

    "we note that these are results from using a model grid with a relatively coarse sampling of initial core masses and clump envelope mass surface densities , yet quite reasonable fits are found .",
    "the derived accretion rates are comparable to the values estimated by other means , e.g. , via observed infall rates in core envelopes ( e.g. , wyrowski et al . 2016 ) and via mass outflow rates ( e.g. , beltrn & de wit 2016 ) .",
    "comparison with the widely used robitaille et al .",

    "<S> we present an overview and first results of the _ sofia _ massive ( soma ) star formation survey , which is using the forcast instrument to image massive protostars from @xmath0@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> these wavelengths trace thermal emission from warm dust that in core accretion models mainly emerges from the inner regions of protostellar outflow cavities . </S>",
    "<S> dust in dense core envelopes also imprints characteristic extinction patterns at these wavelengths causing intensity peaks to shift along the outflow axis and profiles to become more symmetric at longer wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> we present observational results for the first eight protostars in the survey , i.e. , multiwavelength images , including some ancillary ground - based mir observations and archival _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ data . </S>",
    "<S> these images generally show extended mir / fir emission along directions consistent with those of known outflows and with shorter wavelength peak flux positions displaced from the protostar along the blue - shifted , near - facing sides , thus confirming qualitative predictions of core accretion models . </S>",
    "<S> we then compile spectral energy distributions and use these to derive protostellar properties by fitting theoretical radiative transfer models . </S>",
    "<S> zhang & tan models , based on the turbulent core model of mckee & tan , imply the sources have protostellar masses @xmath230@xmath3 accreting at @xmath4@xmath5 inside cores of initial masses @xmath6500@xmath3 embedded in clumps with mass surface densities @xmath73@xmath8 . fitting robitaille et al </S>",
    "<S> . models typically leads to slightly higher protostellar masses , but with disk accretion rates @xmath9 smaller . </S>",
