    "<S> we address a simple connection between results of hamiltonian nonlinear dynamical theory and thermostatistics . using a properly defined dynamical temperature in low - dimensional symplectic maps , we display and characterize long - standing quasi - stationary states that eventually cross over to a boltzmann - gibbs - like regime . as time evolves , the geometrical properties ( e.g. , fractal dimension ) of the phase space change sensibly , and the duration of the anomalous regime diverges with decreasing chaoticity . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario that emerges is consistent with the nonextensive statistical mechanics one .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 05.70.ln 05.10.-a 05.20.gg 05.45.ac + the methods of usual , boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) , statistical mechanics apply to impressively large classes of macroscopic systems . however , the situation is more delicate for complex systems . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> turbulent fluids @xcite , high - energy collision processes @xcite , classical @xcite and quantum chaos @xcite , stellar self - gravitating systems @xcite , granular systems @xcite , economics @xcite , motion of micro - organisms @xcite , and others , frequently exhibit anomalous behaviors where alternative approaches are needed . in particular , in many - body long - range - interacting hamiltonian systems , it has been recently observed the emergence of long - standing ( in the thermodynamical limit _ infinite - lasting _ ) _ quasi - stationary _ ( _ metastable _ ) _ states _ ( qss ) characterized by non - gaussian velocity distributions , before the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) equilibrium is attained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a major concern , as , for these hamiltonian systems , the foundation of the bg equilibrium thermodynamics is questioned . using standard results , in this letter we address a simple connection between chaos theory and thermostatistics , and we focus on a paradigmatic dynamical mechanism that produces qss very similar to those detected in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these qss are displayed and characterized by means of low - dimensional symplectic maps .    </S>",
    "<S> the foundation of the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) equilibrium thermodynamics lies on a sufficiently complete and uniform occupation of the system phase space ( the _ finite _ lebesgue measure @xmath0-space ) , taking into account symmetry , energy and similar restrictions . </S>",
    "<S> the bg equilibrium descends in fact from the _ equal - a - priori - probability postulate _ </S>",
    "<S> , that characterizes the microcanonical gibbsian ensemble ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . according to this postulate </S>",
    "<S> , each equally - sized accessible region of the phase space ( under the macroscopic conditions of the system ) equally likely contains the microscopic state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> as einstein pointed out in his criticism of the boltzmann principle @xmath1 @xcite , this postulate should not be taken _ a priori _ , but rather justified _ a posteriori _ by the underlying dynamics . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> if dynamics is sufficiently chaotic , large portion of the phase space are rapidly occupied by the trajectory of the system and the postulate is a very accurate representation of the dynamical behavior , as testifies more than a century of successes of the bg formalism . </S>",
    "<S> but there are also many situations where the system displays an intricate dynamical behavior , as it happens for example at the border between regular and chaotic regimes .    at this border , for a large class of hamiltonian systems , a mechanism based on the kam theory operates , which we briefly review now . </S>",
    "<S> a continuous hamiltonian system with @xmath2 degrees of freedom may be written in the form @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is integrable ( @xmath5 are its integrals of motion ) , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a nonlinear perturbation . under certain hypothesis ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , for @xmath8 the trajectories lie on invariant @xmath2-dimensional tori . </S>",
    "<S> a special subset of these tori are called _ resonance tori_. specifically , if we introduce the ( non - degenerate ) frequencies of the unperturbed motion : @xmath9 , we have that the condition @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 are integer numbers ) defines the resonance tori . </S>",
    "<S> each resonance torus involves the formation of a separatrix loop . </S>",
    "<S> the action of the perturbation , for small enough @xmath12 , deforms normal tori into kam - tori , and , in correspondence with the resonance tori , destroys the separatrices replacing them with _ </S>",
    "<S> stochastic layers_. resonance tori , in the space spanned by @xmath13 , lie in the intersection between the hyperplane defined by the resonance condition and the hypersurface of energy @xmath14 . in the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 , resonance tori must , for topological reasons , intersect between them . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , while for @xmath16 the stochastic layers are distinct for @xmath17 sufficiently small , for @xmath15 they merge into a single connected stochastic web that is dense in the phase space for all @xmath12 , and there is room for arnold diffusion processes . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that , for @xmath18 , kam - tori constitute _ total barriers _ for diffusive processes in the phase space ; nevertheless , inside the stochastic sea , it is possible to find cantor sets , named _ </S>",
    "<S> cantori _ , that constitute _ partial barriers _ for diffusion ( see @xcite for details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a convenient way of studying hamiltonian systems is by using _ </S>",
    "<S> symplectic maps_. a @xmath19-dimensional symplectic map is obtained from _ conservative _ hamiltonian systems with @xmath2 degrees of freedom by taking a poincar section over the hypersurface of constant energy . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly enough , a @xmath20-dimensional symplectic map is also the result of a poincar section on the phase space of an _ open _ system of @xmath2 degrees of freedom with a hamiltonian that depends _ periodically _ on time . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that in _ both _ cases the map has a symplectic structure ; this assures ( hyper)volume conservation in the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of maps lies on the reduced dimension of the phase space and on the use of a discrete time . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we specifically address some symplectic ( hence conservative ) maps in order to discuss how equilibrium and quasi - equilibrium can be attained in phase space .      in @xcite , the emergence of the dynamical qss appeared to be dependent on the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , it was shown that for some classical long - range - interacting @xmath28-rotor hamiltonian models , a basin of attraction of initial data exist for which the system dynamically evolves into a qss whose duration diverges as @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> typical examples of this basin of attraction are out - of - equilibrium initial conditions called ` water bag ' initial conditions , characterized by a uniform initial distribution of the angular momenta around zero ( see @xcite for details ) . in the case of the standard map , we first observe that the points @xmath30 and @xmath31 are a @xmath21-cycle for all @xmath32 so that we can use them as referential for studying the properties of the phase space with respect to variation of the parameter @xmath32 . with some analogy with @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> our out - of - equilibrium ` water bag ' initial conditions are defined by considering at @xmath33 a _ statistical ensemble _ of @xmath34 copies of the standard map with arbitrary @xmath35 and @xmath36 randomly distributed in a small region around @xmath37 . in standard statistical mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> when dealing with systems with diagonal kinetic matrix and zero average momentum , the temperature is proportional to the average square momentum per particle . as we analyze situations with nonzero ` bulk ' motion , the analogous concept , which we shall refer to as ( dimensionless ) ` dynamical temperature ' , can be defined as the _ variance _ of the angular momentum : @xmath38 , where @xmath39 means ensemble average . the temperature associated with the uniform ensemble ( that we will call bg temperature because of its similarity with the equal - a - priori - probability postulate ) </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noticed that in the present conservative model , the ` temperature ' @xmath41 is necessarily bounded since @xmath36 itself is bounded , in contrast with a true thermodynamical temperature , which is of course unbounded . for large values of @xmath27 ( i.e. , strong chaoticity ) in map ( [ standard ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the ` water bag ' initial ensemble rapidly relaxes to @xmath42 ( let us stress that the subindex @xmath43 stands for the fact that it corresponds to _ uniform _ occupation of the accessible phase space of the map , to be distinguished from the phase space of the physical kicked rotor from which the map was originally deduced ) . our aim is to study what happens in the transition to regularity obtained reducing the value of @xmath27 towards @xmath26 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_std_01](a ) we see that the first effect of the reduction of @xmath27 is that @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this is easily understood as follows . </S>",
    "<S> as chaoticity reduces , total barriers ( kam - tori ) appear in the phase space . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , the points of the ensemble are prevented to reach all the regions of the phase space and the projection of the ensemble on the @xmath36 axis produces a probability distribution function ( pdf ) with a variance smaller than the one of the uniform distribution . for values of @xmath32 of order </S>",
    "<S> @xmath45 , a qss emerges before the relaxation to the final temperature . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , inside the stochastic sea partial barriers ( cantori ) begins to appear , and the initial ` water bag ' first rapidly diffuse inside an area delimited by cantori and then slowly crosses over to the final relaxation temperature . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_std_01](c ) illustrates this behavior . to obtain a quantitative description of the relaxation time we have plotted the iteration time in a logarithmic scale . </S>",
    "<S> we define the crossover time @xmath46 as the inflection point of the curve and we observe that it diverges , as @xmath32 tends to @xmath47 from above , like @xmath48 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_std_01](b ) ) . just below this critical value in fact , </S>",
    "<S> the strongest cantori close @xcite , and the relaxation to a higher temperature is prevented . reducing @xmath32 to smaller values </S>",
    "<S> causes the formation of more and more total barriers , so that the ` dynamical temperature ' tends to zero for @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> > from the mechanism we have displayed , it is clear that it is possible to obtain these types of qss even with other sets of initial conditions . typically , it is sufficient to have the initial data localized inside the first partial barriers . in other words </S>",
    "<S> there is an entire basin of attraction of out - of - equilibrium initial conditions that leads to the formation of a certain kind of qss .    </S>",
    "<S> as we pointed out previously , the topology of the phase space changes dramatically for @xmath15 . to address this case , we move next to a @xmath50-dimensional symplectic map composed by two coupled standard maps : @xmath51 , \\label{standard_standard}\\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\theta_2(t+1)&=&p_2(t+1)+\\theta_2(t)+b\\;p_1(t+1),\\nonumber\\\\ p_2(t+1)&=&p_2(t)+\\frac{a_2}{2\\pi}\\sin[2\\pi \\theta_2(t)],\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 , and all variables are defined @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> if the coupling constant @xmath53 vanishes the two standard maps decouple ; if @xmath54 the points @xmath55 and @xmath56 are a @xmath21-cycle for all @xmath57 , hence we preserve in phase space the same referential that we had for a single standard map . for a generic value of @xmath53 , </S>",
    "<S> all relevant present results remain qualitatively the same . also , we set @xmath58 so that the system is invariant under permutation @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> since we have two rotors now , the ` dynamical temperature ' is naturally given by @xmath60 , hence the bg temperature remains @xmath61 .    as before we consider ` water bag ' initial conditions , i.e. , an ensemble of @xmath34 points with arbitrary @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and angular momenta randomly distributed inside a small region around @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is qualitatively similar to the one displayed in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig_std_01](a ) for @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> large values of @xmath66 correspond to @xmath67 and reducing @xmath66 we observe the formation of a qss that , after some time , relaxes to a temperature @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the first major difference with the 2-dimensional case is that , because of the arnold diffusion processes , the relaxation to a higher temperature occurs ( waiting enough time ) for _ all _ @xmath69 ( i.e. , @xmath70 , defining @xmath71 as the value where @xmath46 diverges ) </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the reason why the ensemble does not relax to the bg temperature for small values of @xmath66 is here quite different from that for the @xmath21-dimensional case . indeed , with this choice of initial data , the initial ` water bag ' intersects at least a macroscopic island , as clearly appreciated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_std_std_01 ] ( a1 ) ; the points that are set inside the island do not diffuse to the outside . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the projection of the ensemble on the plane @xmath72 conserve a denser central part for all times ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_std_std_01 ] ( b1 ) , ( c1 ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> if we instead shift the initial ` water bag ' , say towards the lower part of the phase space , we can set the points outside this island ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_std_std_01 ] ( a2)-(c2 ) ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a crucial qualitatively new phenomenon , namely the formation , for small values of @xmath66 , of a qss that eventually relaxes to the bg temperature ( see fig . [ fig_std_std_02](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that the crossover time @xmath46 diverges , as @xmath73 , faster than in the @xmath21-dimensional case : @xmath74 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_std_std_02](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the relaxation to the bg temperature occurs here _ even _ if the presence of islands in the phase space violate the equal a priori postulate . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to obtain a _ weak _ violation of the postulate that _ does _ preserve a uniform distribution once the ensemble is projected over the plane @xmath72 , in the same sense that a sponge projects a uniform shadow on a wall . </S>",
    "<S> these qss can in fact be geometrically characterized by the _ fractal dimension _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> overcoming some numerical difficulties involved in a fractal analysis in @xmath50 dimensions , we illustrate what happens in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_std_std_02](c ) , constructed using a box - counting algorithm @xcite ( in fact , the phase space exhibits strong inhomogeneities which suggest a multifractal structure ) . during the qss the ensemble is , for small @xmath66 , associated with a nontrivial fractal dimension @xmath76 , while , once it crosses over to the bg - like regime , it distributes itself occupying the full dimensionality of the phase space , thus attaining @xmath77 .    </S>",
    "<S> these simple models allows also for the discussion of different types of qss . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , at @xmath33 we can set up ` double water bag ' initial conditions considering an ensemble of @xmath34 copies of two coupled standard maps with arbitrary @xmath78 and angular momenta randomly distributed inside _ two _ small regions : @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , the initial temperature @xmath82 is higher than @xmath42 , because the pdfs projected on the @xmath72 axes are double peaked . </S>",
    "<S> relaxation to @xmath42 occurs then _ from above _ , as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_std_std_03 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely in what the phenomenon observed in @xcite differs from the one in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is relevant to notice that , as a consequence of arnold diffusion , our results for the @xmath50-dimensional map capture the qualitative behavior of higher - dimension symplectic maps . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the two - plateaux structure has been confirmed by numerical analyses where hundreds of standard maps are all - with - all coupled as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ standard_standard ] ) @xcite .    through the numerical analysis of low - dimensional symplectic maps </S>",
    "<S> , we have displayed how complex paradigmatic structures associated with conservative nonlinear dynamics can generate anomalous thermodynamical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , we have exhibited and studied the emergence , while approaching integrability ( i.e. , when chaoticity decreases ) , of qss suggestively similar to those observed in long - range @xmath28-body systems @xcite ( @xmath66 playing a role analogous to @xmath83 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a central result is that , in contrast with what happens for the bg equilibrium , these qss correspond to a nontrivial fractal dimension . </S>",
    "<S> this situation reminds the phase space structure of logistic - like maps at the edge of chaos ( also characterized by a nontrivial fractal dimension ) , where exact analytical connections with the nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite have been established @xcite . </S>"
