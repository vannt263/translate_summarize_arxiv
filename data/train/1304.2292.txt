    "it is a very well known fact that our universe is experiencing an accelerating expansion at the present time ( perlmutter et al . 1999 ; riess et al . 1998 , 2001 ; tonry et al . 2003 ; tegmark et al .",
    "it is believed that an exotic form of energy with negative pressure called dark energy is responsible for the current observed accelerating expansion of the universe ( tegmark et al .",
    "2004 ; bennet et al . 2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ; abazajian et al .",
    "according to the recent observations we live in a nearly spatially flat universe composed of approximately @xmath5 baryonic matter , @xmath6 dark matter and @xmath7 dark energy .",
    "however , the observational data are far from being complete .",
    "it is not even known what is the current value of the dark energy effective equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath8 which lies close to @xmath1 : it could be equal to @xmath1 ( standard @xmath9cdm cosmology ) , a little bit upper than @xmath1 ( the quintessence dark energy ) or less than @xmath1 ( phantom dark energy ) .",
    "one of the main candidate for dark energy is cosmological constant @xmath9 , which has pressure @xmath10 .",
    "although , cosmological constant can explain the current acceleration phase of universe , it would suffer from many serious theoretical problems , such as the fine - tuning and the coincidence problems .",
    "another candidate for dark energy is provided by introducing scalar fields .",
    "an important class of scalar fields are known as  quintessence \" with @xmath11 ( ratra and peebles .",
    "1988 ; wetterich 1988 ; turner and white 1997 ; caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ; liddle and scherrer 1999 ; steinhardt et al .",
    "1999 ) in which the scalar field mimics the perfect fluid and hence could lead to a solution for coincidence problem .",
    "however , quintessence scenario of dark energy is not in accurate consistent with recent observations as @xmath3 has been favored by recent observations ( knop et al . 2003 ; riess et al . 2004 ; alam et al . 2004 ; hannestad and e. mortsell 2004 ) . to get @xmath3 , a new class of scalar field models with negative kinetic energy , known as ",
    "phantom field \" models have been suggested ( caldwell 2002 ) .",
    "nevertheless , in this case the universe shows some very strange properties ( carroll et al .",
    "2003 ; cline et al . 2004",
    "; buniy and hsu 2006 ; buniy et al .",
    "for example , since the energy density of phantom field is unbounded from below , the vacuum becomes unstable against the production of positive energy fields hence these fields are generally ruled out by ultraviolet quantum instabilities ( carroll et al .",
    "another problem is the future finite singularity called big rip ( caldwell et al .",
    "2003 ) which leads to the occurrence of negative entropy ( brevik et al .",
    "therefore , on the one hand observations mildly favors models with @xmath12 crossing @xmath1 near the past and on another , models with @xmath3 are unstable from theoretical point of view . in this paper",
    "we suggest a simple mechanism to overcome this discrepancy by introducing bulk viscosity in the cosmic fluid .",
    "first , viscosity causes dark energy which is varying in quintessence to pass the phantom divided line ( pdl ) and drop it to phantom region .",
    "next , since viscosity is a decreasing function of time , it will die out and @xmath12 will leave phantom region and tend to @xmath1 at late time .",
    "hence the problem of future singularity ( big rip ) will never occur in this scenario .",
    "+ it has been shown in refs ( mcinnes 2002 ; barrow 2004 ) that , an ideal cosmic fluid , i.e. non - viscous , give raise to the occurrence of a singularity of the universe in the far future called big rip .",
    "the singularity problem can be modified or soften via following two methods .",
    "the first is the effect of quantum corrections due to the conformal anomaly ( brevik and odintsov 1999 ; nojiri and odintsov 2003 , 2004 ) and second , is to consider the bulk viscosity of the cosmic fluid ( for example see ( misner 1968 ; padmanabhan and chitre 1987 ; brevik and hallanger 2004 ) .",
    "the viscosity theory of relativistic fluids was first suggested by eckart , landau and lifshitz ( eckart 1940 ; landau and lifshitz 1987 ) . the introduction of viscosity into cosmology has been investigated from different view points ( gr@xmath13n 1990 ; barrow 1986 ; zimdahl 1996 ; maartens 1996 ) .",
    "the astrophysical observations also indicate some evidences that cosmic media is not a perfect fluid ( jaffe et al . 2005 ) , and the viscosity effect could be concerned in the evolution of the universe ( brevik and gorbunova 2005 ; brevik et al .",
    "2005 ; cataldo et al .",
    "it was also argued that a viscous pressure can play the role of an agent that drives the present acceleration of the universe ( zimdahl et al .",
    "2001 ; balakin et al .",
    "the possibility of a viscosity dominated late epoch of the universe with accelerated expansion was already mentioned by padmanabhan and chitre ( padmanabhan and chitre 1987 ) .",

    "recently , viscous dark energy and generalized second law of thermodynamics has been studied by setare and sheykhi ( 2010 ) .",
    "+ to be general , we use generalized flrw equations by considering an anisotropic metric as the line - element of the universe .",
    "the reason for this choice of metric is behind the fact that because of high symmetry , flrw models are infinitely improbable in the space of all possible cosmologies .",
    "the high symmetry involved in flrw models requires a very high degree of fine tuning of initial conditions which is extraordinary improbable .",
    "moreover , we can always ask that does the universe necessarily have the same symmetries on very large scales outside the particle horizon or at early times ? + the plan of our paper is as follows : in section @xmath14 we give the metric and field equations . in section @xmath15",
    "we drive the generalized flrw equations by solving the field equations of section @xmath14 .",

    "our results are summarized in section @xmath20 .",
    "we consider the bianchi type i space - time in the orthogonal form as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are functions of time only .",

    "we assume the four velocity vector @xmath38 satisfying @xmath39 . + in a co - moving coordinate system ( @xmath40 ) , einstein s field equations ( [ eq2 ] ) with ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) for b - i metric ( [ eq1 ] ) subsequently lead to the following system of equations : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 if we consider @xmath45 as the average scale factor of bianchi type i model , then the generalized mean hubble s parameter @xmath46 defines as @xmath47    the bianchi identity @xmath48 leads to @xmath49 .",
