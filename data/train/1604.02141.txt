    "* primary physics with secondary beams of @xmath2 s * + not all of physics can be explored by primary beams of electrons and protons , however much these have taught us over the past 60 years .",
    "electron - positron colliders give access to restricted sets of quantum numbers . from proton - proton collisions",
    "we have long learned about all manner of high energy reactions .",
    "however , access to excited mesons and baryons has been most universally achieved with pion and kaon secondary beams , and latterly photon beams both virtual and real . nowadays",
    "the wealth of information on polarized photon beams on polarized targets has totally revolutionized baryon spectroscopy , especially in the lightest flavor sector .",
    "the measurement of polarization asymmetries has constrained partial wave analyses far beyond anything conceivable with pion beams .",
    "nevertheless , these only give access to the product of photocouplings of each excited baryon and its coupling to the hadron final state , such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , _ etc . _ contemporaneously , in the meson sector , the compass experiment with pion beams on protons at 190  gev/@xmath6 , together with heavy flavor decays in @xmath7 annihilation , have given access to multi - meson final states , like 2@xmath8 , 3@xmath8 , with greater precision than ever before .",
    "this has given hints and suggestions of new resonances , like the @xmath9 .",
    "+ to understand the constituent structure of hadrons requires information on the relationship of each meson and baryon to those with different flavors , but the same @xmath10 quantum numbers . at its simplest ,",
    "this is to understand the quark model multiplet structure , where this is appropriate .",
    "what is more , so ubiquitous are @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , ... final states as the decay products of almost every hadron , that knowledge of the properties of these is critical to every analysis .",
    "unitarity colors and shapes the universality of such final state interactions in each set of quantum numbers .",
    "this means that however precise our measurements of @xmath16 , with gluex for instance , we can not really determine the fine resonant structure of such a process without some information on @xmath17 and @xmath18 scattering too . nor can we determine any flavor partners without information on the corresponding @xmath19 channels . for that",
    "secondary kaon beams are essential . + while j - parc has a whole program of charged strange particle and hypernuclear reactions , photon beams allow unique access to other channels .",
    "it was realized long ago that intense photon beams like that about to be delivered to hall  d at jlab , could produce secondary beams .",
    "the charged particles can readily be bent away , leaving a neutral particle beam dominated by @xmath2 : long lived kaons being produced far more copiously than neutrons above 34  gev momentum .",
    "such a facility provides access to a whole range of physics that is the subject of this meeting .",
    "+ the reactions that can be studied cover the meson spectrum and dynamics , the baryon spectrum and dynamics , and final state interactions that link mesons and baryons together .",
    "this includes particularly the channels @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 in the meson sector .",
    "these explore the very limitations of chiral dynamics : the strange quark s current mass is 30 - 50 times that of the average @xmath23 mass , so corrections from explicit breaking are likely significant . moreover , are there eight or nine goldstone bosons ? in a world of large @xmath24 , a nonet of light pseudoscalars is natural , but is the @xmath25 world close to this or not ? at the same time , information on @xmath26 final states , with @xmath27 , is vital in understanding excited meson multiplets .",
    "this also provides links to @xmath28 dynamics and its relation to @xmath29 and @xmath30 with hidden strangeness . in the baryon sector , while earlier seemingly  missing \" states are appearing with @xmath31 s and @xmath32 s , few of the related @xmath33 s and @xmath34 s are known . +",
    "the exact connection of the constituent quark model to qcd is not really understood .",
    "nevertheless calculations in lattice qcd with heavier than physical pions give a baryon spectrum much like that of the constituent quark model .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising since with only single hadron operators , the excited states are almost stable . though dynamical quarks allow additional @xmath35 pairs to be produced , with a heavy pion ( and hence heavy @xmath23 quarks ) the fock space of excited @xmath31 s are dominated by @xmath36 configurations .",
    "computations including gluonic operators allow hybrid states of @xmath37 that are a gev or so heavier than @xmath36 configurations with the same @xmath10 . the spectrum from lattice qcd can be regarded as the 21st century version of the constituent quark model .",
    "however , it is naturally improvable , not just because by lowering the pion mass the phase space for decays increases .",
    "this is not sufficient to reproduce experiment .",
    "more efficacious is the inclusion of multiparticle scattering states .",
    "hadrons become resonances by coupling to these scattering states . for mesons like the @xmath38 and @xmath39 , rather precise calculations have now been made , but for baryons like those in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] , which are much more computationally intensive , these are still to come . +    + +    + + scattering states do not just allow decays and give the states a width , but these in turn shift the masses of the resonances , particularly when the decays are @xmath40-wave . for their strange partners , with fewer open channels ,",
    "the shifts may be less , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] .",
    "thus one might expect the strange , doubly strange and even more the triply strange baryons to be closest to where our new lattice version of the constituent quark model may predict , while the @xmath31 s and @xmath32 s may be shifted significantly .",
    "+ indeed in some cases they may be indistinguishable from the continuum , in others coventional and hybrid baryons may have distinct decay patterns .",
    "so where the @xmath33 s , @xmath41 s and @xmath34 s are that partner the roper , @xmath42 with @xmath43 , may teach us about how this dynamics works .",
    "it is likely much of this same dynamics with its interplay of both colored ( quark and gluon ) and color singlet degrees of freedom underlies the appearance of the @xmath44 , and @xmath45 states .",
    "indeed such interplay is integral to generating their very existence .",
    "strange baryon studies enabled by @xmath2 beams may provide unique insights into this newly exposed world .",
    "+ since the primary focus of the gluex experiment is to study the photoproduction of mesons , it is unrealistic to expect its replacement by a secondary beam of @xmath2 s before a few years of photon data - taking .",
    "indeed , there would be little point until the dirc bars , and even a rich for kaon identification , are in place . then",
    "while the gluex analysis is concentrating on gluonic excitations with millions of events on many channels , from which to extract physics , perhaps an opportunity arises to show that a secondary @xmath2 beam can provide unique data on the very strange baryons . a short program that successfully identifies @xmath34 s and @xmath46 s not just as bumps in cross - sections , but with quantum numbers determined from their decays , may spur the demand for longer running and make the @xmath2 beam a facility for hadron physics unique in the world .",
    "+ a long march starts with the rst stride : this is the step taken by this workshop .",
    "the second step is to plan for the minimal be target , sweeping magnet and pair spectrometer required for a feasibility run . as always this requires a lead time of several years .",
    "consequently whether to proceed , to even this limited stage within the hall  d schedule , demands a timely decision .",

    "1 .   * motivation for @xmath0 photoproduction * + in july 1964 christenson , cronin , fitch and turlay announced  @xcite the observation of the long - lived @xmath0 decaying to two pions , which was the discovery of cp - violation .",
    "it was already realised that @xmath47 physics was extremely interesting  @xcite , with particles and their antiparticles being distinct under strong interactions , but able to mix through weak interactions to form short - lived and long - lived states , now called @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "that was the year i started my postgraduate studies at manchester university .",
    "paul  murphy led the group from 1965 , and the nearby daresbury nuclear physics laboratory ( dnpl ) was constructing a 5  gev electron synchrotron , nina ( northern institutes national accelerator ) .",
    "this would be a local laboratory for the northern universities to balance the rutherford laboratory s nimrod 7  gev proton accelerator in southern england .",
    "the possibility that a useful @xmath0 beam could be made at an electron synchrotron by photoproduction was being considered , and a 1965 prediction for slac by drell and jacob  @xcite was optimistic .",
    "they expected the dominant mechanism to be virtual @xmath39-exchange in the @xmath50-channel , @xmath51 , with a cross section , peaking at @xmath52 , at least 20  @xmath53b / sr , for 15  bev ( now gev ! ) photons .",
    "we now know that @xmath39-exchange is not the dominant process . + in 1965 , the manchester group decided to measure @xmath0 photoproduction at nina with a view to using the beam for decay measurements . 2 .",
    "* first observations * + while our manchester experiment was being carried out the first  observation \" of photoproduced @xmath0 was published  @xcite by the cambridge bubble chamber group ; after scanning 865,000 ( sic ! ) hydrogen bubble chamber photographs they found about 50 examples of @xmath54 . of these",
    ", 35 were classified as @xmath55 events , and a few were possibly photoproduction of @xmath56 , but the evidence for that was  weak \" .",
    "this was followed by an experiment  @xcite in 1967 , using a multi - gap optical spark chamber , still taking photographs but now with the ability to trigger on a neutral particle entering the fiducial volume ( with a veto counter ) and a pair of charged particles in a scintillation counter hodoscope behind . as in our manchester experiment ,",
    "a @xmath48-regenerator was placed in front of the decay volume .",
    "there was no magnetic field , but coplanar v s were selected , and assuming @xmath57 the kaon momentum is known from kinematics .",
    "the cambridge electron accelerator produced 5.5  gev electrons , and the @xmath0 were produced in al- and be - targets at polar angles from 0@xmath58 - 10@xmath58 . since an intermediate photon beam was not used , the flux is a combination of electro- and photo - production in the targets . with about 400 events , they reported a yield of 1.3 @xmath59/electron for @xmath60  gev/@xmath6 at 3.5@xmath58 .",
    "the spectrum peaks at 2  gev/@xmath6 , which they interpreted as due to @xmath61-photoproduction and decay , incorrectly as it turns out .",
    "absence of @xmath0 with momenta closer to the beam momentum gave an upper limit on the two - body processes : @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "schivell  _ et al .",
    "_ said it was  @xcite : _ an extremely clean beam which appears quite free of neutrons _ , although they did not elucidate .",
    "of course for most  decay \" experiments neutron background in unimportant , but for scattering and interaction experiments it can be serious . +",
    "a major hydrogen bubble chamber study  @xcite ( 1.7 million pictures ! ) using a bremsstrahlung beam up to @xmath64 = 5.8  gev at desy reported a few @xmath65 events with @xmath66 = 0.68@xmath670.48  @xmath53b , with a considerably larger cross section for @xmath68 .",
    "so @xmath0 photoproduction at these energies is usually accompanied by pions .",

    "automatic \" ( electronic ) spark chambers , to progress beyond the prevalent scanning and measuring of bubble chamber or optical spark chamber pictures .",
    "we built small prototypes of three types : ( a ) sonic , with three microphones around the edge of the spark gap , and timing the sound of the sparks , ( b ) magnetostrictive , with one electrode consisting of wires crossing a magnetostrictive ribbon , and ( c ) ferrite core memory , in which each wire of an electrode plane was threaded through a @xmath691  mm diameter ferrite core .",

    "( so our core memory board had about 1  mm@xmath70/bit ; compare with memory density today , 50 years later ! )",

    "consequently , it shows up in form of a strong cusp around the @xmath251 threshold , a feature which is observed in recent experiments with large statistics .",
    "we should also note that our theoretical results provide the absolute strength for both the @xmath223 and @xmath234 production as a consequence of the theoretical framework that generates dynamically these two resonances .",

    "+ although not strictly referring to the electroweak couplings , the unresolved proton radius puzzle  @xcite can also be interpreted as a violation of lepton universality .",

    "lepton universality can be tested with high precision experiments that aim at measuring certain observables very precisely which can be calculated in the sm very accurately and where new physics effects would be enhanced .",

    "the secondary neutrons escape the core but mostly stop in the surrounding iron shielding and the labyrinth walls .",
    "a couple of the beam electrons shown in the plot have produced bremsstrahlung gammas energetic enough to kick the electrons visibly away from the beam line .",
    "they end up cascading and depositing their energy in the first labyrinth wall and spraying some of the cascading electrons and gammas back into the vault .",
    "more beam electrons produce lower energy gammas in the radiator and get deflected at smaller angles , hitting exit flanges and narrower portions of the exit beam line and producing essentially full 12  gev electromagnetic cascades in the vault .",
    "the bremsstrahlung gammas produced at the radiator go straight along the exit beam line through the magnet yoke and forward to hall  d proper .",
    "+ the model allowed us to simulate the operational radiation environment and optimize the shielding design at the vault , corresponding to the nominal operating conditions in the hall  d complex .",
    "the first commissioning runs in 2015 indicated that the observed radiation fields in the tagger vault are in agreement with the calculations within a factor 2 or 3 , which is acceptable given all uncertainties in the model and in the measurements .",
    "the estimates for the  brute force \" solution of simply increasing the radiator thickness to produce more intensive photon beams at the vault indicate that that an increase of the prompt radiation would be way beyond the present design limitations and is indeed problematic .",
    "* new  compact photon source \" solution * + as a solution to this apparent problem , we suggest designing and implementing the  compact photon source \" ( cps ) device . the new conceptual design combines in a single properly shielded assembly all elements necessary for the production of the intense photon beam , such that the overall dimensions of the setup are limited and the operational radiation dose rates around it are acceptable .",
    "the experiment does not require tagging of the produced photons , so the new design could be compact and hermetically closed by the shielding , as opposed to the present tagger magnet concept .",
    "one of the earlier cps concepts was published recently  @xcite and proposed for use in the wacs experiment at jlab  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : cps_plot4 ] illustrates the geant3 model of such a device .",
    "the assembly is small enough to fit in the tagger vault immediately after the tagger magnet .",

    ", the electron beam enters the well shielded cps device .",
    "first , the beam electrons see the new radiator , as thick as necessary to produce photon beam optimized for @xmath1 production downstream .",

    "an illustration of the beam propagation and absorption in the cps device is given in fig .",

    "the dump design includes the entrance slit for the main electron beam and for the tail electrons that lost their energy in the radiator and are deflected farther down .",
    "the slit provides the condition for the main electron - produced cascade to originate roughly in the middle of the bulk dump volume , such that there was sufficient shielding in all directions and the products of the cascade were contained in the dump as much as possible .",
    "+ the dump will also provide a long - bore channel for the main bremsstrahlung gamma beam to go through , with the critical collimation aperture placed in the middle of the bulk volume to contain most of the secondary products generated in the collimator .",
    "a borated poly outer layer is useful for slowing , thermalizing , and absorbing fast neutrons still exiting the bulk shielding .",
    "we suggest that the exit photon channel and beam line in the vault also be shielded properly .",
    "+    + + the geant3 model calculations show that the overall dimensions of the cps assembly could stay reasonably small ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cps_plot5 ] ) , while achieving the overall dose rates at the tagger vault comparable to nominal hall  d operations .",

    "radiator , the dose rates in the vault during full 60  kw beam operations are comparable to the nominal running conditions in the vault , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cps_plot6 ] .",
    "the radiation spectral composition is different ; most of the dose rate contribution in the cps setup is from higher energy neutrons .",
    "the comparison indicates that at equal beam currents , gamma radiation dose rates are much smaller for the cps run ( an order of magnitude ) , and neutron dose rates in the area are comparable . +    + + the dramatic difference between the overall dimensions of the present dump package and the new proposed compact solution is explained by using high density and high - z material in the new design , and also by making it hermetic , that is , covering the beam dump entrance volume almost as solidly as in all other directions .",
    "the present hall  d tagger dump design was opportunistic as it used the standard copper beam dump device and standard iron shielding blocks available at that time .",
    "the design required dump accessibility , so it was not possible to make the shielding hermetic , and heavy labyrinth walls were needed . using a tungsten alloy with a density about 2.5 times higher than iron , all linear dimensions can be made correspondingly smaller .",
    "another factor was a certain degree of conservatism required for a permanent design , which can be avoided in the design dedicated for a limited - period experiment .",
    "+ one of the special features of the new concept design is the difficulty of reaching its innards once operations have started , because of the high levels of induced radioactivity inside .",
    "thus , special attention should be devoted to the reliability of all inner elements of the cps . 6 .   * implementation features and cost estimate * + we do not see principal obstacles to implementation of the cps concept in the experiment .",
    "+ the new dump core may have characteristics close to the one installed already , such that the dump cooling system can be re - used ( maximum 60  kw cooling power ) .",
    "+ to make long and narrow photon beam collimation we propose to build the core using two symmetric flat plates , left and right , and make matching grooves in them for the beam entry cones , beam line , and the aperture collimator .",
    "+ most of the present tagger area equipment may remain in place ; the cps will be assembled around the modified gamma line .",
    "+ the available permanent magnet may be used in the cps assembly ( pending thermal engineering analysis , as there will be a need to have it cooled , dissipating approximately 1.5  kw of power deposited in it ) .",
    "available identical spare magnet can be installed at the end of the beam line in the tagger as a protective measure .",
    "alternatively , a new powered magnet could be designed for the cps , with a comparable field integral ( it does not have to be highly precise ) .",
    "in such a case , the present permanent magnet will be moved downstream .",
    "+ the cps solution for the new intense high energy gamma source in the tagger vault will be characterized by the absence of extra prompt irradiation or extra beam line activation for existing structures in the area during and after the operations .",
    "the accumulation of radioactivity inside the cps will be significant , to a large degree preventing access to the inner parts immediately after operations .",
    "however , such activation will not present a problem while the cps stays assembled , due to a very strong self - shielding .",
    "+ there will be a possibility of switching between the two modes of hall  d operations : a low intensity tagged photon beam , and high intensity photon beam from the cps .",
    "+ disassembly and decommissioning could be postponed until radioactive isotopes decay inside to manageable levels .",
    "+ cost would include detailed iterative modeling and simulation to optimize operation parameters , design , engineering and production , plus the choice and cost of bulk shielding material .",
    "+ rough cost expectation : within $ 0.5  m. 7 .",
    "* conclusions * + compared to the alternative , the proposed cps solution presents several advantages , including much less disturbance of the available infrastructure at the tagger area and better flexibility in achieving high - intensity photon beam delivery to hall  d. + the proposed cps solution will satisfy proposed @xmath1 beam production parameters + we do not envision big technical or organizational difficulties in the implementation of the conceptual design . 8 .   *",

    "l \"- shaped , stainless steel and aluminum vacuum chamber with a 1  cm thick rohacell extension surrounding the target cell .",
    "the start counter for the gluex experiment fits snugly over this extension .",
    "the vacuum chamber , along with the hydrogen storage tanks , gas handling system , and control electronics , is mounted on a custom - built beam line cart for easy insertion into the hall  d solenoid .",
    "a compact i / o system monitors and controls the performance of the target , while hardware interlocks on the target temperature and pressure and on the chamber vacuum ensure the system s safety and integrity .",
    "the target can be cooled from room temperature and filled with liquid hydrogen in about 5 hours . for empty target runs ,",
    "the liquid can be boiled from the cell in less than twenty minutes .",
    "the cell remains filled with cold hydrogen gas for these runs and can refilled with liquid in about forty minutes .",
    "+ the gluex cell ( fig .  [ fig : twocells ] ) is closely modeled on those used for experiments in hall  b at jefferson lab for more than a decade  @xcite .",
    "it is a horizontal , tapered cylinder about 38  cm long with a mean diameter of 2  cm .",
    "a 2  cm diameter reentrant beam window defines the length of lh@xmath164 in the beam to be about 30  cm .",

    "the liquid can be subcooled a few degrees below the vapor pressure curve , greatly suppressing the formation of bubbles in the cell . in total , about 0.4  liter of lh@xmath164 is condensed from the storage tanks , and the system is engineered to safely recover this quantity of hydrogen back into the tanks during a sudden loss of insulating vacuum , with a maximum allowed pressure of 49  psia  @xcite .",

    "+ the gluex target system is expected to operate equally well with liquid deuterium ( ld@xmath164 ) , which condenses at a slightly higher temperature than hydrogen : 23.3  k versus 20.3  k at atmospheric pressure . because the expansion ratio of ld@xmath164 is 13% higher , the storage pressure will about 60  psia .",

    "+ dnp targets generally fall into one of two categories : continuously polarized and frozen spin . in the former case the dnp process",
    "is maintained continuously throughout the scattering experiment , while frozen spin targets are polarized intermittently , and the scattering data is acquired while the polarization slowly decays .",
    "continuously polarized targets require a highly uniform polarizing magnet of 2.55  t whose geometry limits the acceptance of scattered particles .",
    "a similar magnet is also required to polarize a frozen spin target , but the target sample can then be removed from the high field and maintained by a much less massive  holding \" magnet during data acquisition , provided it is cooled to a temperature of 50  mk or less . for this reason",
    "frozen spin targets are limited to particle beams no greater than about 10@xmath347  s@xmath346 , while continuously polarized targets have operated up to @xmath348  s@xmath346 . because of its high resistance to radiation damage , irradiated ammonia ( nh@xmath349 or nd@xmath349 ) continuously polarized at 1  k and 5  t is the usual choice for electron beams up to 140  na .",
    "chemically doped butanol ( c@xmath350h@xmath351o ) has become the material of choice for frozen spin targets , thanks to its ease of production and handling , and its lack of polarizable background nuclei other than hydrogen .",

    "+ a frozen spin target consumes liquid helium at a rate of a few liters per hour to operate the dilution refrigerator .",
    "the hall  d cryogenic plant may not be able to provide this volume of lhe to a polarized target and maintain the gluex solenoid at the same time . in this case",
    "the polarized target will require a separate source of lhe , and should be designed to economize @xmath353he consumption .",
    "alternatively , one may consider a so - called  cryogen - free \" dilution refrigerator ( cfdr ) , where the circulating @xmath70he is condensed by a small cryocooler such as the ptr utilized for the gluex cryotarget  @xcite .",
