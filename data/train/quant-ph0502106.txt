    "any processing of quantum information , be it storage or transfer , can be represented as a quantum channel : a completely positive and trace - preserving map @xmath2 that transforms states ( density matrices ) on the sender s end of the channel into states on the receiver s end . until now",
    "most of the work on quantum channels has concentrated on _ memoryless _ channels , which are characterized by the requirement that successive channel inputs are acted on independently .",
    "mathematically , this means that messages of @xmath3 symbols are processed by the tensor product channel @xmath4",
    ".    however , in many real - world applications the assumption of having uncorrelated noise channels can not be justified , and _ memory effects _ need to be taken into account .",
    "it thus seems desirable to extend the theory of quantum channels to encompass memory effects , and to create a common framework in which experiments with both correlated and uncorrelated noise can be naturally described .",
    "in fact , such a framework is already necessary for estimates on almost memoryless channels , for instance when assessing whether a particular system can arguably be modelled as a memoryless channel . in the present paper",
    "such a unified framework will be presented , and it will be shown how this model can be applied to the description of different information processing tasks , such as ( private ) classical and quantum information transfer .",
    "in our contribution we present a general model for quantum channels with memory .",
    "in addition to alice s input register @xmath5 and bob s output register @xmath6 , such a channel has an additional memory input and an additional memory output , denoted by @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : memory ] , left ) .",
    "long messages with @xmath3 signal states will then be processed by subsequent application of these memory channels , resulting in the concatenated channel @xmath8 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : memory ] ( right ) .",
    "this picture will be turned into a rigorous definition in section  [ sec : constructive ] , after the mathematical framework will have been introduced in section  [ sec : notations ] .",
    "[ cc][cc]time [ cc][cc]*s *   _ left : _ a quantum memory channel with input register @xmath5 , output register @xmath6 , and memory system @xmath9  _ right : _ a threefold concatenation @xmath10 of memory channels , with time running from left to right , and coded information running from bottom to top.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in such a setup , the memory system is passed on from one application of the channel to the next , and introduces ( quantum or classical ) correlations between consecutive signal states . if no memory system is present , the concatenated channel will simply be a product channel , bringing us back to the memoryless realm in which consecutive signal states are acted on independently .",
    "+ this model marks a _ constructive approach _ to quantum channels with memory .",
    "it is certainly the appropriate framework when the physical realization of the memory @xmath7 is known .",
    "however , in many applications of information theory only the input - output behavior of a channel is of interest . from this point of view",
    "the memory would be part of the internal workings of the channel , and would not be made part of the description .",
    "we call this way of describing channels the _ axiomatic approach _ : it takes a channel as a transformation turning infinite strings of input systems to infinite strings of outputs , with only two basic assumptions : translation invariance and the condition of _ causality_. outputs up to some time @xmath0 do not depend on inputs at times @xmath11 . in the classical theory ,",
    "such channels are sometimes called _ non - anticipatory_. it is clear from fig .  [ fig : memory ] that a channel with memory automatically satisfies this causality condition .    taking a causal channel and representing it as a channel with memory amounts to reconstructing a model of the channel and its internal memory states and dynamics .",
    "this is a highly non - trivial task , even in the classical case .",
    "however , a formal reconstruction can always be given .",
    "this is what we call the _ structure theorem _ for causal channels , and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] . a rigorous version will be given as th .",
    "[ theo : structure ] in section  [ sec : causal ] . in general",
    ", it produces not only the channel step operator @xmath2 , but also a map @xmath12 defining the influence of input states in the remote past on the memory .",
    "intuitively , however , such a map is often not needed , because memory effects decrease in time .",
    "a similar condition is needed for passing from the constructive approach of channels with memory to causal input - output channels : since the constructive approach allows one to choose the initial memory state , output states in general depend on this choice , and in general this influence will depend on the time after initialization .",
    "so in order to get a time translation invariant channel without such dependence , the channel @xmath2 must lose the initialization information .",
    "we call @xmath2 _ forgetful _ if outputs at a large time @xmath0 depend only weakly on the memory initialization at time zero , in a sense made precise in section  [ sec : forgetful ] . for forgetful channels , memory effects",
    "will be shown to decrease even exponentially .",
    "[ cc][cc]time [ cc][cc]*s * [ cc][cc]*r * [ cc][cc]*t * [ cc][cc]@xmath13 [ cc][cc]@xmath14    not every channel is forgetful .",
    "the prime counterexample is a channel with a",
    "_ global classical switch _ discussed in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "the memory in this case is a classical bit , left unchanged by @xmath2 , but determining which of two memoryless channels @xmath15 is applied to the input at each time .",
    "however , we will show in section  [ sec : forgetful ] that generic memory channels are in fact forgetful , in the sense that every non - forgetful quantum channel can be approximated by a forgetful channel to arbitrary degree of accuracy .",
    "in addition , for every forgetful quantum channel we may find a finite - size neighborhood in which all channels are likewise forgetful . in mathematical terms , forgetful quantum channels are both _",
    "open _ and _ dense _ in the set of quantum memory channels .",
    "+ for quantum channels with memory , capacity can be defined along the lines familiar from the memoryless setting @xcite , both for the transmission of classical and quantum information .",
    "channel capacity expresses quantitatively how well a given channel @xmath2 can simulate a noiseless qubit ( or bit ) channel : roughly speaking , it is the maximal number of ideal qubit ( resp .",
    "bit ) transmissions per use of the channel , taken in the limit of long messages and using encoding and decoding schemes asymptotically eliminating all errors .",
    "the concept is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : concatenate ] .    however , when trying to send information through a concatenated memory channel , unlike in the memoryless case we also have to specify how to handle the initial and final memory state .",
    "in particular , we may distinguish between setups in which alice can access the initial memory input state and may use it for the encoding procedure , and setups in which a malicious third party ( eve , say ) controls the initial memory input , and by her choice of the input state will try to prevent alice and bob from communicating over the channel .",
    "likewise , we may consider setups in which either bob or eve control the final memory output .",
    "these distinctions will be made precise in section  [ sec : capacity ] .",
    "they lead to slight variations in the notion of capacity , and in section  [ sec : examples ] we will present several examples to show that the resulting capacities may or may not coincide . in particular , for channels with only one kraus operator , all these capacities are the same , and equal the capacity of the ideal channel ( cf . section  [ sec : pure ] ) . +    [ cc][cc]encoding [ cc][cc]*s * [ cc][cc]decoding [ cc][cc]@xmath16   two signal states are encoded into three input registers , sent through the concatenated memory channel , and then decoded into two output states . if the overall channel is ( in some sense to be specified in section  [ sec : capacity ] ) close to the ideal channel on two inputs , the transmission rate of the above scheme is @xmath17 .",
    "capacity is the largest such rate , in the limit of long messages and optimal encoding and decoding . in the above setup",
    ", the initial memory input can be thought of as being controlled by either the sender or a malicious third party .",
    "similarly , the receiver may or may not be able to read out the final memory state.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the various capacities can be bounded from above both in terms of the capacity of memoryless channels and in terms of entropic expressions . some of these bounds will be presented .",
    "in particular , the standard mutual information and coherent information bounds familiar from the memoryless setting easily extend to memory channels ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : bounds ] ) .",
    "+ forgetful channels are , in a sense to be specified in section  [ sec : forgetful ] , close to memoryless channels . as such",
    ", they play a central role not only as the bridge between the axiomatic and the constructive approach to quantum memory channels and as generic examples for quantum memory channels , but also connect them to the memoryless realm . in section  [ sec : coding ] , we will explain how the standard random coding techniques familiar from the memoryless setting can be modified to saturate the entropic upper bounds on the channel capacity for forgetful channels , leading to coding theorems for ( private ) classical and quantum information transfer for this very important class of memory channels .",
    "+ we conclude with a summary and outlook . an appendix contains some mathematical background relevant to the description of infinite - dimensional quantum systems , insofar as it is essential to the understanding of the structure theorem .",
    "quantum channels which naturally acquire a memory are abundant in all branches of quantum information processing :    recently , an unmodulated spin chain has been proposed as a model for short distance quantum communication @xcite . in such a scheme ,",
    "the state to be communicated over the channel is placed on one of the spins of the chain , propagates for a specific amount of time , and is then received at a distant spin of the chain ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : spinchain ] ) .",
    "when viewed as a model for quantum communication , it is generally assumed that a reset of the spin chain occurs after each signal @xcite , for example by applying an external magnetic field , resulting in a memoryless channel .",
    "however , a continuous operation without reset may lead to higher transmission rates , and corresponds to a quantum channel with memory .",

    "in such a device , excited atoms interact with the photon field inside a high - quality optical cavity , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : maser ] .",
    "if the photons inside the cavity have sufficiently long lifetime , atoms entering the cavity will feel the effect of the preceding atoms , introducing correlations between consecutive signal states .",
    "+ apparently , the first model of a quantum channel with memory was introduced by macchiavello et al . in 2001 : they gave an example of a qubit channel with markovian correlated noise @xcite in which entangled input states may increase the transmission rate for classical information .",
    "these results have recently been extended to some bosonic gaussian channels @xcite .",
    "such an effect has been demonstrated experimentally for optical fiber channels with fluctuating birefringence , in which consecutive light pulses undergo strongly correlated polarization transformation @xcite .",
    "( whether such examples exist in the _ memoryless _ setting is still an open question , and presently considered one of the most eminent open problems of quantum information theory , with wide implications for other problems in the field @xcite . )    subsequently , the study of quantum channels with memory has largely been confined to channels with markovian correlated noise ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a lindbladian approach to memory channels has been taken by daffer et al . @xcite .",
    "upper bounds on the classical capacity for a more general class of channels have been given recently by bowen et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "all the memory channels discussed in this section are causal quantum channels , and thus the structure theorem applies .",
    "a completely different approach has been taken by hayashi and nagaoka @xcite , who refrain from imposing any structural assumption on the quantum channels they consider , and apply the information - spectrum method to obtain a coding theorem for the classical product state capacity , following work by verd and han @xcite on classical channels with memory .",
    "we refer to verd s overview paper @xcite and the gray - davisson collection @xcite for more information on memory channels in the purely classical setting .",
    "according to the rules of quantum mechanics , every quantum system is associated with a hilbert space @xmath18 , which for the purpose of this paper can mostly ( but not always , see the discussion in section  [ sec : picture ] ) be taken as finite dimensional .",

    "the physical states associated with the system are density operators @xmath20 , where the latter denotes the space of trace class operators on @xmath21 .",
    "a _ quantum channel _ @xmath2 which transforms input systems described by a hilbert space @xmath22 into output systems described by a ( possibly different ) hilbert space @xmath23 is represented mathematically by a completely positive unital map @xmath24 . by unitality",

    "most notably , this includes quasi - local algebras and stinespring s dilation theorem .      from the informal discussion in section  [ sec :",
    "outline ] it is clear that the definition of channel capacity requires the comparison of the quantum channel after the encoding and decoding process with an ideal channel . as a measure of the distance between two channels we favor the _ norm of complete boundedness _ , ( or _ cb - norm _ , for short ) @xcite , denoted by @xmath36 . for two channels",

    "it is evident that the theory may be extended to memory channels assisted by additional resources , such as entanglement and classical side communication . as seen in section  [ sec : bounds ] , entropic bounds typically depend only on the amount of information shared by sender and receiver , and not on the internal structure of the quantum channel linking these two .",
    "coding theorems for memoryless channels can easily be extended to forgetful memory channels , as demonstrated in section  [ sec : coding ] .",
    "they typically lead to regularized expressions for the channel capacity , which still require the solution of optimization problems in hilbert spaces of exponentially growing dimensionality . in general , computing capacities of quantum memory channels is thus at least as challenging as for memoryless channels , with less hope for improvements .    a general study of the resulting capacity landscape is still pending .",
    "in particular , we do not yet know under which general conditions some ( or all ) of the channel capacities introduced in def .  [ def : cap ] coincide",
    ". it may seem reasonable to conjecture that , as long as the memory system is finite - dimensional , it is irrelevant for capacity purposes whether bob or eve control the final memory output . while this is almost immediate for the entropic upper bounds on the channel capacities ( cf .",

    "so while it is always possible to approximate a given non - forgetful channel by a forgetful channel to arbitrary degree of accuracy , their capacities may be very different , as the example given in section  [ sec : forgetful ] demonstrates .",
    "this calls for a more detailed analysis of non - forgetful quantum channels and their capacities .    while we have presented several equivalent criteria for a memory channel to be forgetful ( cf .",

    "apart from some relatively simple model channels , little is known so far about the channel capacity of general non - forgetful memory channels .",
