    "the remarkable scaling properties of the ads - cft correspondence@xcite have been proven extremely useful as a calculational device for the scaling behaviour of holographic pairs , known as the _ holographic renormalization group ( rg)_. in this communication , the aforementioned scaling properties will be studied in a somewhat different context .",
    "we ll adopt the formalism of local quantum physics@xcite , in terms of c*-algebras of local observables , for which a structural ( i.e. , model - independent ) form of the ads - cft correspondence has been proven by rehren .",
    "this form , called _ algebraic holography _ or _",
    "rehren duality _ , is , however , a statement for local observables in a _ fixed _ spacetime background : some aspects that are linked to unrestricted general covariance , such as conformal anomalies@xcite , are quite obscure in our setting .",
    "nevertheless , it will be shown that other phenomena , such as the uv / ir connection@xcite and the very duality between the dynamics between different leaves of the poincar foliation of anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime and the rg flow of the boundary ( minkowski ) theory , here appear naturally .",
    "here we shall review the main ideas underlying rehren duality .      let the @xmath0-dimensional minkowski space be denoted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and its conformal compactification by @xmath3 .",
    "anti - de sitter space - time with @xmath4 dimensions ( denoted @xmath5 , or simply @xmath6 , when no confusion about dimensionality arises ) can be described by its embedding in @xmath7 , given by the quadric ( let @xmath8 ) @xmath9 its boundary at spatial infinity is timelike , and conformal to @xmath3 .",
    "the ( identity component of the ) isometry group of @xmath10 is @xmath11 ( @xmath6 group ) .",
    "a crucial feature of it is that it coincides with the conformal group of @xmath1 . in @xmath5",
    ", we can define a causally complete region @xmath12 called a ( standard ) _",
    "wedge_. the class of all wedges is obtained by the action of the @xmath6 group on @xmath13 . using a poincar",
    "coordinate patch @xmath14 @xmath15 in the region @xmath16 , we can write the @xmath17 metric as @xmath18 and the standard wedge as @xmath19 by taking the limit @xmath20 , we reach the boundary @xmath1 , yielding the intersection of @xmath13 with it : @xmath21 this is the ( standard ) _ diamond _ in minkowski space .",
    "let @xmath22 be a bijection from the set of all wedges in @xmath10 to their intersections with @xmath10 boundary ( namely , the conformal class of diamonds ) , such that :    * @xmath23 , and * it interwines both actions of @xmath11 on @xmath10 and @xmath3 .",
    "such an @xmath22 preserves inclusions and causal complements .",
    "moreover , wedges and the conformal class of diamonds generate all open sets in their respective spaces .",
    "we work with theories of local observables , defined as a ( isotonous , anti - de sitter covariant and causal ) net of unital c*-algebras @xmath24 indexed by all regions @xmath25 in @xmath17@xcite .",
    "notice that we mean _ causal _ with respect to the _ covering _ of @xmath17 , since pure @xmath17 possesses closed timelike curves .",
    "the correspondence @xmath22 built above between the set of wedges @xmath26 and the conformal class of diamonds @xmath27 allows us to build a ( isotonous , conformally covariant and causal ) net of unital c*-algebras @xmath28 over the regions @xmath29 by defining    @xmath30    therefore , we can state the    theorem ( rehren duality)@xcite.__from an anti - de sitter covariant and local net of observables in @xmath10 , one can build an one - to - one correspondence to a conformally covariant and local net of observables in @xmath3 , interwining the action of @xmath11 and preserving inclusions and causal complements ( net isomorphism ) . _ _",
    "consider again the poincar coordinate patch ( [ poinc ] ) , which can be seen as to define a foliation ( warped product ) of the region @xmath31 .",
    "for each fixed @xmath32 , the ( timelike ) _ leaf _ @xmath33 is conformal to minkowski spacetime by a conformal factor of @xmath34 .",
    "two other crucial property of these leaves are :    1 .",
    "the subgroup of @xmath11 defined by @xmath35 ( poincar subgroup ) leaves every leaf invariant and acts as the ( @xmath0-dimensional ) poincar group on each leaf , including the boundary @xmath36 ; 2 .",
    "the subgroup of @xmath11 defined by @xmath37 ( dilation subgroup ) leaves the region @xmath38 invariant , and acts as the dilation subgroup of @xmath1 _ only at the boundary_.    using rehren s theorem as a guide , one can think of the regions    @xmath39    as images of @xmath13 under a family of maps @xmath40 that interwine the actions of the poincar ( sub)group with respect to each leaf , just as @xmath22 interwines the actions of the full @xmath17 group .",
    "furthermore , by assigning to each region in ( [ pcone1 ] ) the c*-algebra @xmath41 and extending the nets to all @xmath1 by poincar covariance , we get a family of ( isotonous , poincar covariant ) _ leaf nets _ of observables , indexed by @xmath32 .",
    "the leaf nets possess , relatively to the boundary net , the following properties :    * * * scaling dynamics:**@xmath42 @xmath43 ( remember that the dilations act covariantly on the boundary net ) ; and , as a natural consequence of this , * * * algebraic uv / ir connection:**@xmath44",
    "@xmath45    the last property requires some explanation .",
    "the physical content of the leaf nets is merely a description of the relation between the energy - momentum behaviour of the bulk and the boundary theories . to show this",
    ", we ll perform the construction of the respective _ scaling algebras _ over _ minkowski _ spacetime , following the work of buchholz and verch@xcite .",
    "definition@xcite .",
    "physically , the scaling net corresponds to all admissible ( multiplicative ) renormalization prescriptions in the underlying theory , which , of course , must be all physically equivalent if the theory has sufficiently good uv behaviour .",
    "an important question to be asked is : _ how do the scaling algebras @xmath46 and @xmath47 compare ? _ the answer is simple and is given by ( [ rg2 ] ) : the scaling properties coincide up to the scale @xmath48 , for each corresponding leaf net .",
    "should we ignore the contribution of the scaled observables below @xmath48 ( uv cutoff ) , the corresponding leaf net will behave just like the boundary theory dual to a `` ir - cutoff '' @xmath17 net .",
    "this somewhat loose explanation suggests the name `` algebraic uv / ir connection '' , since a similar phenomenon occurs in the ( stringy ) ads / cft correspondence@xcite .",
    "this is a slightly modified version of a poster presentation made at this conference .",
    "the author would like to thank kostas skenderis for the enlightening discussions and the subsequent email exchange , and karl - henning rehren for pointing out an error in a previous version ."
