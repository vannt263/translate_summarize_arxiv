    "more recently , the measurement of the degree of deviation form gaussianity has attracted significant attention as this would help pinpointing the correct model among very many inflationary models .",
    "for example , the density fluctuations arise from simple slow - roll inflationary models with a single scalar field is almost purely gaussian @xcite , and the deviation from the gaussianity would then be unobservably small @xcite .",

    "the s / n ratio for the auto - correlation is quite large . even for ska ,",
    "the s / n ratio becomes 3.8 for @xmath180 .",
    "this suggests that in the absence of significant foregrounds and systematics , the auto - correlations of 21  cm is a better probe than the cross - correlations ( as expected since it depends on @xmath3 ) , while the cross - correlations contains only 1 factor of @xmath4 . nevertheless , it is interesting to look at the cross - correlations , since it is more likely we can rid of systematics and foregrounds that are common to both cmb and 21  cm experiments than completely clean 21  cm of all of the possible foregrounds and systematics in large scales . in the calculation of the s / n ratio ,",
    "we ignore the foreground contamination of the cross - correlation between cmb and 21 cm fluctuations . in reality",
    ", some of the foregrounds for 21-cm observations also have the correlation with cmb observations @xcite .",
    "this may affect significantly the detection of the signal .",
    "therefore a better model of the foreground is essential for any 21  cm constraint on the non - gaussianity .",
    "the tidal approach suggested by @xcite can be a potential technique to reduce such foreground contamination from 21 cm mapping .    in the paper , we consider only one redshift slice for the 21  cm observation in this paper .",
    "we can observe many redshift slices by choosing the observation frequency . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : snratio ] ) , taking many redshift slices would increase s / n ratio for each @xmath0 . as a result ,",
    "multi - frequency observation of 21  cm fluctuations can bring the better constraint on @xmath0 than the one redshift slice such as considered in this paper .",
    "in particular , the s / n ratio for the auto - correlation receives benefit richly from multi - frequency observation .",
    "it can be expected that even the s / n ratio for ska become enough to measure the non - gaussianity as studied in @xcite . on the other hand , the signal of the cross - correlation in the redshift evolution reaches a peak during the epoch when the ionized fraction becomes a half @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in contrast to the case of the rapid reionization , there is possibility to utilize many redshift slices for 21  cm fluctuations in the case of the slow reionization , as the cross - correlation signals arises during a long period due to the slow evolution of the ionized fractions .    finally , we focus the signals from the eor on large scales .",
    "however it is well - known that the distribution of the bubbles affect cmb anisotropies and 21  cm fluctuations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effect of non - gaussianity can be expected to arise on small scales .",
    "we will leave this to future work .",
    "we thank n. sugiyma , m. mcquinn and u .- l .",
    "pen for their insightful comments .",
    "s.h . would like to acknowledge the department of energy lawrence berkeley national laboratory chamberlain and seaborg fellowship which supports the production of this work ."
