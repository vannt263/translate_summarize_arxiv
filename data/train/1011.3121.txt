    "this work is part of a large programme to examine agb variable stars in local group galaxies .",
    "ngc6822 is a magellanic - type dwarf irregular with a central bar and an extended stellar halo ; it is the nearest isolated dwarf galaxy in the local group .",
    "the observations were made with the sirius camera on the irsf at saao .",
    "three fields were used to cover a total area of @xmath1 arcmin@xmath2 and 19 observations were made over a period of four years .",
    "only a subset of the data has been analyzed in detail , from which we have identified 30 mira variables with @xmath3 mag and 9 sr variables with lower amplitudes .    )",
    "relation for miras ( red circles ) and srs ( green squares ) .",
    "the line shows the lmc pl(@xmath4 ) relation . ]",
    "1 shows the miras and srs on a period luminosity , pl(@xmath4 ) , relation , where the absolute @xmath4 mags were determined on the assumption that the distance modulus to ngc 6822 is 23.43 mag .",
    "it is clear that many of the miras , particularly the redder and longer period ones , fall below the predicted pl(@xmath4 ) relation .",
    "2 shows the bolometric pl relation and compares it with that obtained for c - rich miras in the lmc .",
    "the agreement is good , so we can understand the departure from the pl(@xmath4 ) as a consequence of circumstellar extinction .",
    "further work is required to fully characterize the other variables in ngc 6822 and to determine if they all are carbon - rich , as we assume here .",
    "this sample already provides a very good group with which to calibrate the mira pl relation beyond the magellanic clouds .",
    "we anticipate a good deal of interest in this as the next generation of telescopes from the ground and from space start to image ever more distant individual stars in the infrared ."
