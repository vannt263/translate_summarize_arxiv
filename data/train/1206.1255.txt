    "even if the super - ehlers group is a bosonic extension of the ehlers group itself , the presence of the @xmath13-duality commutant @xmath22 in ( [ emb ] ) is closely related to supersymmetry .",
    "it is intriguing to notice that the super - ehlers symmetries , which we classify below in any dimension , sometimes exhibit an _ enhancement \" _ into some larger group ; this occurs whenever the embedding ( [ emb ] ) is _",
    "non_-maximal , and in @xmath25 type iib supergravity .",
    "furthermore , it sometimes occurs that the embedding ( [ emb ] ) is maximal but _ non - symmetric _ , as in @xmath19 supergravity .    at any rate",

    ", it generally holds that@xmath26the same relation holds for the _ non - compact rank _ of these groups , namely the rank of the corresponding symmetric riemannian manifolds of which the groups encode the isometries : @xmath27where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the maximal compact subgroups of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . as mentioned above",
    ", this does not imply the embeddings to be in general maximal nor symmetric . *",
    "the pseudo - riemannian coset resulting from ( [ emb ] ) has always zero _ character _",
    "@xcite , namely it has the same number of compact and non - compact generators .",
    "we will show that this latter property is related to the _ poincar duality _ ( _ alias _ electric - magnetic duality ) of the spectrum of massless @xmath30 forms of the theory , which can essentially be traced back to the existence of an _ hodge involution _ in the cohomology of the scalar manifold , singling out only the physical forms and their duals in the cohomology of the @xmath31-dimensional transverse space .",
    "this property also follows from the regularity of the embedding of @xmath32 inside @xmath21 , the semisimplicity of the two groups and properties ( [ rank1]),([rank2 ] ) , as it will be shown in appendix [ gf ] .    there is also another aspect of interest in the present analysis : the role played by exceptional lie groups and their relation to jordan algebras and freudenthal triple systems @xcite . in particular , a mathematical construction , called",
    "_ jordan pairs _ ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent treatment , and a list of refs . ) corresponds to the maximal non - symmetric embedding@xmath33which is nothing but ( [ emb ] ) specified for maximal supersymmetry ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 .",
    "we point out that the _ jordan pairs _ relevant for supergravity theories always pertain to suitable non - compact real forms of lie algebras , differently _",
    "e.g. _ from the treatment given in truini-1 .",

    "thus , for instance maximal supergravity corresponds to @xmath44 ( @xmath45 spinor supercharges in @xmath9 ) , whereas the minimal supergravity we consider has @xmath46 ( @xmath47 spinor supercharges in @xmath9 ) .",
    "we then proceed to considering the embedding ( [ emb - n=16 ] ) pertaining to maximal supergravity in any dimension @xmath6 ( in @xmath25 both iia and iib theories are considered ) .",
    "the embedding ( [ emb ] ) , which can be regarded as the _ non - compact enhancement \" _ of nahm s analysis @xcite , in all cases consistently provides the massless spectrum of the corresponding theory with the correct spin - statistics content ; illustrative analysis is worked out for @xmath19 and @xmath25 maximal theories .",

    "[ sec - quarter - maximal ] we consider quarter - maximal theories ( @xmath56 ) , which live in @xmath57 and admit two different kinds of matter multiplets .",

    "of @xmath60 , the little group ( _ spin _ ) of massless particles in @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "the number of supersymmetries @xmath61 is encoded in the clifford algebra of @xmath43 , and therefore the supermultiplets can be regarded as @xmath62 spinors decomposed into @xmath63 irreps ( for theories with particles with spin @xmath64 , which we consider throughout , @xmath65 ) .",
