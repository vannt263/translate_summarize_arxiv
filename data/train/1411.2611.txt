    "galactic outflows originating in regions of high star formation surface - density and in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) likely play a significant role in regulating the metal content of galaxies and are probably fully responsible for the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "understanding the distribution and extent of the cool gas surrounding galaxies can aid in constraining the metal contribution via winds to the cgm and igm .",
    "though there are many studies of outflows originating from star - forming galaxies @xcite , we are only beginning to understand the effect and distribution of gas surrounding agns ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recent work has shown that large gas reservoirs surround quasars with a covering fraction of 6080% and a physical extent of 200  kpc @xcite , similar to what is observed for inactive field galaxies @xcite .",
    "the cool gas surrounding field galaxies , as traced by absorption , exhibits an anisotropic distribution whereby most gas is located along their projected major and minor axes , which is interpreted to be due to accretion and outflows , respectively @xcite .",
    "quasars also exhibit an anisotropic gas distribution possibly caused by the intense agn - driven ionizing radiation that heats the gas to temperatures of @xmath9k and destroys cool gas clouds out to a few hundred kiloparsecs @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed 74 quasar ",
    "quasar pairs with projected separations of @xmath10  kpc and showed that , although quasars exhibit a high covering fraction of cool gas as traced by and , cool gas is rarely detected along the jet ( ` down - the - barrel ' ) of the quasar itself .",
    "they suggest that the background quasar sight - lines intercept gas that is shadowed from the ionizing radiation of the quasar jet .",
    "similar anistropy has been observed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the cgm of agns , like seyfert galaxies , has yet to be explored .",
    "if the agn radiation field is responsible for destroying cool gas , then the orientation of the agn - driven outflows with respect to the background quasar sight - line may dictate the presence , strength and frequency of the absorption .",
    "the inclination of the agn - driven outflows are primarily constrained by the unified agn model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the type of agn observed may be dependent on the observers vantage point , or essentially the agn dust torus inclination .",
    "quasars and blazers are typically viewed down - the - barrel of the agn jet ( face - on torus ) , while broad - line seyfert  i objects are viewed at a slightly higher inclination and narrow - line seyfert  iis are viewed with an edge - on torus . if one were to probe quasars or blazars with background quasars , the dusty torus is in the plane of the sky ( face - on and orthogonal to the jet ) and provides the maximum cross - section of radiation - shielded extended halo gas , yielding the highest covering fraction of cool halo gas . therefore , we would expect that the cool gas covering fraction surrounding agns should decrease as the inclination of the dusty torus decreases from face - on to edge - on for quasars , seyfert  is and seyfert  iis , respectively .",
    "motivated by the idea that the gas covering fraction of agns may change with viewing angle ( according to the unified model ) , we target a sample of 14 narrow - line agn ( seyfert iis ) to examine their cool cgm gas covering fractions .",
    "we target @xmath11 agn so that we are able to detect the mg0.1emii  @xmath12 and 0.05emd @xmath13 absorption doublets from ground - based facilities and we are able to resolve the morphological properties of their host galaxies in ground - based images . we investigate the cool gas covering fractions and azimuthal angle dependencies .",
    "we show that agn exhibit intrinsic absorption , unlike quasars , and we quantify their outflow properties . in section  [ sec : data ] we present our sample and data reduction . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present the gas covering fractions and azimuthal dependencies .",
    "present clear signs of intrinsic ( down - the - barrel ) cool gas outflows originating from ongoing star - formation rather than the jets and quantify their outflow properties . in section  [ sec : dis ] , we discuss what can be inferred from the results and how it arises naturally from the agn unified model .",
    "concluding remarks are offered in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . throughout",
    "we adopt an h@xmath14  mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 cosmology ."

    "<S> we performed a detailed study of the extended cool gas , traced by absorption [ @xmath0   ] , surrounding 14 narrow - line active galactic nuclei ( agns ) at @xmath1 using background quasar sight - lines . </S>",
    "<S> the background quasars probe the agns at projected distances of @xmath2  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , between @xmath3  kpc , agns appear to have lower gas covering fractions ( 0.09@xmath4 ) than quasars ( 0.47@xmath5 ) and possibly lower than in active field galaxies ( 0.25@xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find a statistically significant azimuthal angle dependence for the covering fraction around agns , though the data hint at one . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the ` down - the - barrel ' outflow properties of the agns themselves and detect intrinsic 0.05emd absorption in 8/8 systems and intrinsic absorption in 2/2 systems , demonstrating that the agns have significant reservoirs of cool gas . </S>",
    "<S> we find that 6/8 0.05emd and 2/2 intrinsic systems contain blueshifted absorption with @xmath7  , indicating outflowing gas . </S>",
    "<S> the 2/2 intrinsic systems have outflow velocities a factor of @xmath8 higher than the 0.05emd outflow velocities . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with agn - driven outflows destroying the cool gas within their halos , which dramatically decreases their cool gas covering fraction , while star - burst driven winds are expelling cool gas into their circumgalactic media ( cgm ) . </S>",
    "<S> this picture appears contrary to quasar  </S>",
    "<S> quasar pair studies which show that the quasar cgm contains significant amounts of cool gas whereas intrinsic gas found ` down - the - barrel ' of quasars reveals no cool gas . </S>",
