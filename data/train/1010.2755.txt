    "filaments appear to be common structural features in both quiescent and star - forming molecular clouds . in particular , recent observations of molecular clouds with _",
    "herschel _ @xcite have signified the role of filaments as a momentous , perhaps even dominant mode of star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , their formation and small scale structure is still not well understood and under debate ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite noted that filaments tend to fragment into equally spaced condensations of sizes @xmath3{pc}$ ] .",
    "these clumps , in turn , consist of even smaller , gravitationally bound entities , namely cores , of sizes @xmath4{pc}$ ] , which is of the order of the local jeans length .",
    "these cores are then believed to be the direct precursors of stars and binary systems ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "such a hierarchical structure can also be found in the taurus molecular cloud ( fig.[fig01 ] ) , which is one of the closest star - forming regions at a distance of only @xmath5{pc}$ ] @xcite , and therefore an excellent testbed to study the small scale structure of filaments .",
    "large scale surveys in co @xcite and mid - infrared dust emission @xcite , alongside with dust extinction maps @xcite have built a detailed view of a complex network of filaments in taurus , which are known to be the birth sites of stars ( see reviews about star formation in taurus by e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these filament are composed of clumps @xcite with sizes of @xmath6{pc}$ ] , which host a plethora of cores with typical sizes of @xmath7{pc}$ ] .",
    "these have been detected e.g.  via molecular line observations tracing cold and dense gas with volume densities of @xmath8{cm^{-3}}$ ] , such as nh@xmath9 @xcite and h@xmath10co@xmath11 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) .",
    "further down in this hierarchical structure , from dust continuum observations @xcite found a population of pre- and protostellar cores , supposedly representing the scale of direct core - protostar connection .",
    "the taurus molecular cloud is known to host @xmath12 young stellar objects ( ysos , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and their distribution shows a strong correlation to the filamentary structures , i.e.  their birth sites @xcite .    to further understand the connection between filamentary structures and star formation , it is essential to characterize the filament in high spatial resolution over a wide dynamic range .",
    "molecular line species can be used as probes for column densities , but typically rather exhibit a narrow dynamical range .",
    "larger dynamical range can be achieved by thermal dust emission observations , which are used to trace intermediate to high column densities , and dust extinction mapping , which is more sensitive at low to intermediate column density range ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a comparison of different methods ) .",
    "the aforementioned observations allow to determine the structure of the low density clumps on one hand , and the core population detected by dense gas tracers on the other hand . however , to make a direct connection between the diffuse envelope structure and the denser cores , one preferably needs a single tracer with a uniform calibration , which covers both these regimes .    therefore , the aim of this work is to create a column density map of l1495 @xcite with unprecedented dynamical range and resolution with the aid of near - infrared ( nir ) dust extinction mapping .",
    "nir colors of stars in the background of clouds provide hundreds to thousands of pencil beam measurements of reddening , which can be smoothed out to construct maps of column density along a molecular cloud .",
    "this is the basis of nir excess technique nice and its derivatives @xcite , which obtain extinction measurements by correlating the observations from the science field with a nearby control field .",
    "the color excess with respect to this control field is then completely attributed to be caused by the molecular cloud .",
    "these methods typically probe extinctions @xmath13{mag}$ ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allowing us to examine both the detailed fragmentation of the filament into dense cores , and the envelopes surrounding them .",
    "thus , the observations presented in this paper will provide the most complete census of the small scale structures in the taurus filament so far , and shed more light on the link between filaments and star - forming cores .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ s - obs ] we give an overview of the observations and data reduction . in ",

    "[ s - summary ] .",
    "we carried out nir observations of the taurus filament l1495 with the omega2000 camera at the calar  alto  3.5 m telescope .",
    "the camera is equipped with a hawaii2 hgcdte detector that offers 2048@xmath142048 pixels with a pixel scale of @xmath15{\\arcsec}$ ] and a field of view of @xmath16{\\arcmin}$ ] .",
    "observations were carried out during two observing periods from october  2004 to december  2005 @xcite and january to march  2009 . in total , 21  science fields and 1  control field were observed in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 bands ( @xmath20{\\mu m}$ ] , @xmath21{\\mu m}$ ] , and @xmath22{\\mu m}$ ] , respectively ) .",
    "the locations of the observed frames are shown in fig.[fig01 ] .",
    "the observations of a single omega2000 field consisted of 30 dithered exposures , each having an integration time of @xmath23{s}$ ] .",
    "this resulted in total exposure times of 30  minutes per filter per field .",
    "we performed a standard nir data reduction with the omega2000 pipeline @xcite , including flatfield , dark , and bad pixel corrections , sky subtraction , and image registering .",
    "the world coordinate system ( wcs ) was appended to the frames with ` koords ` @xcite by matching the positions of at least 10  stars per frame to matching stars from the corresponding 2mass image .",
    "this resulted to the rms accuracy of @xmath24{px}$ ] ( or @xmath25{\\arcsec}$ ] ) in all frames .",
    "in addition to stars , a significant amount of background galaxies was expected to be detected in the frames . in order to disentangle these two types of sources from each other , we performed photometry using sextractor @xcite , which provides an automatic source classification via the so - called _ stellarity index _",
    "( ` class_star ` ) .",
    "in particular , photometry was run in a fully automated two - pass mode .",
    "first , sextractor was run for the brightest stars only , in order to get an accurate estimate of the seeing , which is a crucial input parameter to get reliable measures of the stellarity index , and furthermore determined our choice of aperture size .",
    "second , the actual photometry was performed , resulting in instrumental magnitude and uncertainty , position , the stellarity index @xmath26 , elongation @xmath27 ( the inverse of the aspect ratio ) and the parameter @xmath28 , which is a source s fwhm normalized by the seeing .",
    "each source was classified as either star or galaxy following the classification scheme from @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "a source is regarded as a _ star _ if it fulfills two out of the three following conditions :    * @xmath29 * @xmath30 * @xmath31    which are indicated as hatched regions in in fig.[fig02 ] .",
    "the photometric calibration was done for each frame separately by matching sources within the frame with stars from the 2mass catalog , and determining photometric zero - points and color corrections using those stars .",
    "these catalogs in @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 were then merged , and sources with a detection in only one filter were rejected .",
    "saturated stars were replaced by their 2mass counterparts .",
    "the final catalog of l1495 contains @xmath3233,000 sources , of which 63% are classified as stars , according to our classification scheme .",
    "photometric uncertainties for an excerpt from this catalog are shown in fig.[fig03 ] .",
    "the median magnitudes for which @xmath33{mag}$ ] are at @xmath34{mag}$ ] , @xmath35{mag}$ ] and @xmath36{mag}$ ] , which is on average @xmath37{mag}$ ] deeper than 2mass , and emphasizes the depth of our observations .",
    "we used the @xmath38 photometry of the detected sources to derive dust extinction through the taurus filament l1495 . in the following ,",
    "we first shortly describe the adopted technique and then present the results .    as mentioned earlier , in addition to stars",
    "there is a significant number of background galaxies among detected sources .",
    "the intrinsic colors of galaxies are very different from those of stars , and therefore theses two classes need to be treated separately in deriving extinction towards them . this difference is illustrated in fig.[fig04 ] , which shows color - color diagrams of our reference ( right panel ) and one science field ( left panel ) . especially in the reference field , one can clearly see the different color distribution of stars and galaxies , as it is unaffected by the dust extinction from the molecular cloud .",
    "we note that there is a concentration of stars at @xmath39=[0.7,1.0]$ ] that is clearly outside the zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) of stars .",
    "these sources could be ysos , brown dwarfs , or even point like distant galaxies and or quasars .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a nir color - excess mapping technique tailored specifically for inclusion of galaxies . in this technique ,",
    "the _ colors of stars _ behind the cloud are compared to the intrinsic colors of stars in the reference field .",
    "in addition , the _ magnitude dependent colors _ of _ galaxies _ are compared to those in the reference field .",
    "this comparison yields a pencil - beam - like extinction value towards each source ( for further details we refer to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from these values",
    "we then generate a uniformly gridded extinction map by smoothing the data using a gaussian kernel .",
    "sigma - clipping removes sources with outliers in extinction , which might be caused by intrinsically different colors ( e.g.  ysos , brown dwarfs , etc ) . for our map , we chose a resolution of @xmath40{\\arcmin}$ ] as a compromise between resolving the small scale structures in the filament and having low noise over the dynamical range covering most of the map . in this resolution ,",
    "the map covered the dynamical range of @xmath41{mag}$ ] .",
    "the noise of the final map depends on extinction , being @xmath42{mag}$ ] at @xmath43{mag}$ ] and @xmath44{mag}$ ] at @xmath45{mag}$ ] .",
    "fig.[fig05 ] shows the resulting extinction map , with blow - ups of different regions of it shown in fig.[fig06 ] .",
    "the map reveals , on one hand , a remarkably well defined , high aspect ratio filamentary structure , and on the other hand complex clumpy substructures within this filament .",
    "we note that within the mapped region we find six barnard objects , namely the clumps b211 , b213 , b216 , b217 , and b218 ( which represent the _ filament _ ) , and b10 ( which forms the _ hub _ ) .    within the filament ,",
    "the lowest completely mapped iso - contour is at @xmath46{mag}$ ] . the total mass within this region is @xmath47{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}}$ ] , yielding a mass surface density of @xmath48{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}\\,pc^{-2}}$ ] .",
    "table[tab01 ] lists these parameters also separately for the subregions .",
    "the mass was estimated from the extinction map by assuming all hydrogen in molecular form and the standard conversion factor of @xmath49{cm^{-2}mag^{-1}}$ ] @xcite , which then yields the total hydrogen mass @xmath50{pc}}\\right)^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{\\unit[0.45]{\\arcmin}}\\right)^2\\,\\sum_i \\left(\\frac{a_{{\\rm v},i}}{\\unit[1]{mag}}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the distance to the cloud , @xmath52 is the pixel scale of the map , and @xmath53 are the extinction values of the individual pixels . using a standard cloud composition of 63% hydrogen , 36% helium and 1% dust @xcite one can assume the total mass from equation([equ01 ] ) to be @xmath54    lccc b211 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 + b213 & @xmath58 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 + b216 & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 + b217 & @xmath64 & @xmath65 & @xmath66 + b218 & @xmath67 & @xmath68 & @xmath69 +   + total & @xmath70 & @xmath71 & @xmath72",
    "the blow - ups shown in fig.[fig06 ] reveal numerous dense fragments with peak extinction values of @xmath73{mag}$ ] .",
    "this population of _ dense cores _ ) shows that these are indeed dense cores , i.e. gravitationally bound entities with densities of @xmath74{cm^{-3}}$ ] .",
    "therefore , we already introduce this term here , for reasons of consistency . ] will be investigated in more detail in the following section .",
    "the main filament is strongly meandering along almost its entire length of @xmath75{pc}$ ] , and sometimes forms even ring - like structures ( e.g.  b216 , b10 ) .",
    "however , b211 is different in that it exhibits a linear , narrow _ bar _ with a length of @xmath76{pc}$ ] and a median fwhm of only @xmath77{pc}$ ] .",
    "the inter - core regions also show considerably higher extinction values of @xmath78{mag}$ ] in contrast to the other parts of the filament , where cores seem to be rather isolated .",
    "identification and characterization of small - scale structures , such as cores , from 2d data ( e.g.  extinction maps or continuum observations ) is a long - lasting , non - trivial problem , and several methods exist ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we adopted a two - step approach , which consisted of background removal and 2d thresholding . in the first step",
    ", we performed a subtraction of large - scale structures from the map using wavelet filtering .",
    "this resulted in a map describing structures only at spatial scales smaller than @xmath79{pc}$ ] ( `` cores - only '' map , c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . in the second step",
    ", we used the 2-dimensional thresholding algorithm clumpfind2d @xcite to identify a population of dense cores from the cores - only map .",
    "the algorithm works by first contouring the data ( usually these levels are defined by a detection threshold , and subsequent contours with separations of multiples of the rms noise of the observations ) , and then searches for peaks of emission , which mark the cores .",
    "it then follows these down to lower intensities , assigning every pixel to a certain core ( if any ) .",
    "obviously , such an algorithm works best for isolated cores .",
    "@xcite pointed out that for observations , where one has to deal with blending of cores , clumpfind2d is very sensitive to the choice of input parameters .",
    "therefore , we ran a set of calculations with different values of detection thresholds and level separations .",
    "we performed various tests , which included visual verification of the positions , sizes and shapes of the cores .",
    "a detection threshold and a level separation of @xmath80 was chosen to yield a representative core distribution .",
    "this is in agreement with the simulations by @xcite , in which such parameters resulted in an acceptable core identification .",
    "however , the narrow _ bar _ in b211 was not removed by the wavelet filter , eventually not allowing a look at the `` naked cores '' .",
    "this prohibited a reliable recovery of the dense cores and their properties in b211 .",
    "we believe that this is caused by its different structure , which is discussed in more detail in  [ s - analysis_sf ] .",
    "therefore , we did not consider this region in the following investigation .",
    "furthermore , we also did not take into account b10 because of its cluster - like nature and very high extinction , that does not allow to break the structure into separate cores @xcite .",
    "follow - up analysis using _ dendrograms _",
    "@xcite on 3d position - position - velocity molecular line data might allow us to also disentangle the dense core population in these two regions in the western part ( l1495w ) . in this paper",
    ", however , due to the limitations of 2d data we restrict our analysis to the dense core population in the eastern part ( l1495e ) , which consists of regions b213 , b216 , b217 , and b218 .    in total 39  cores",
    "were detected in l1495e ( fig.[fig07 ] , table[tab02 ] ) .",
    "we calculated the core orientation together with the zeroth , first and second moment , which after suitable conversions conformed to the core mass , position and fwhm along the minor and major axis .",
    "furthermore , we defined the effective radius as @xmath81 , assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "we note that the mass is quite insensitive for the choice of the threshold level , changing on average only 15% when going from 3@xmath82 to 6@xmath82 . a few cores ( # 23 , # 29 and # 35 ) extended beyond our mapped region .",
    "we used data from the 2mass catalog to extend the map to cover these cores completely .",
    "the nearest neighbor separation of the cores exhibits a strong peak at @xmath83{pc}$ ] with a dispersion of @xmath84{pc}$ ] , and all cores had at least one neighbor within @xmath85{pc}$ ] . another approach to quantify the `` clustering '' is to measure the two - point correlation function ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the number of core pairs @xmath86 with separations in the interval @xmath87 $ ] is compared to the number @xmath88 in a sample , where cores were randomly distributed over the whole region .",
    "the two - point correlation function is then @xmath89 applying this to our sample of cores , strong correlations , i.e.  @xmath90 , on separations of @xmath91{pc}$ ] and @xmath92{pc}$ ] are evident ( fig.[fig07 ] ) .",
    "the latter , large separation derives from small clusters of dense cores at both ends of l1495e , whereas the first one represents the separation between the individual cores inside these clusters . at our pixel scale of the map",
    ", a separation of @xmath93{pc}$ ] corresponds to @xmath94{px}$ ] , and is , therefore , well above the resolution limit .",
    "core masses range from @xmath95{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}}$ ] .",
    "the total mass found in cores is @xmath96{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}}$ ] , which makes up @xmath3250% of the total mass in l1495e ( as defined by the @xmath46{mag}$ ] contour ) .",
    "we derived mean core densities @xmath97 , and hydrogen number densities @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the proton mass and @xmath100 the mean molecular weight per hydrogen molecule , assuming a molecular cloud with standard composition @xcite .",
    "the frequency distribution of the derived number densities closely follows a gaussian distribution with @xmath101{cm^{-3}}$ ] and a dispersion of @xmath102{cm^{-3}}$ ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig08 ] , we show the mass - size relation of the cores in our sample . for reference , the figure also shows the sensitivity limit of @xmath103{mag}$ ] for an isolated , flat and spherical core .",
    "@xcite derived a slope of of @xmath104 for the dense cores of the pipe nebula . due to the low number of cores and the strong influence of the completeness limit on the fit",
    ", we rather show representative relations with constant column density ( @xmath105 ) , which would be predicted for clouds obeying larson s laws @xcite , and constant volume density ( @xmath106 ) , which would be expected in case of constant thermal pressure and kinetic temperature .",
    "however , with the data at hand we can not rule out one or the other model .",
    "the dense core mass function ( dcmf ) , which is the number of cores per logarithmic mass interval @xmath107 , exhibits its maximum at @xmath108{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}}$ ] , and falls off to both the low - mass and high - mass ends ( fig.[fig09 ] ) .",
    "this peak could be either true , or simply be caused due to incompleteness .",
    "however , estimating the completeness and accuracy of the dcmf is not a trivial task ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is partly due to the inability of the adopted algorithm to detect cores from the variable , more extended column density component .",
    "partly it is also due to the noise in the map , which makes mass determination of low - mass cores significantly less accurate than for high - mass cores . in an analysis similar to this paper",
    ", @xcite analyzed the accuracy derived for the cores in the pipe nebula , and concluded the dcmf to be accurate above about @xmath20{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}}$ ] . by comparing the noise levels within these two maps",
    "we roughly estimate the dcmf to be accurate for @xmath109{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}}$ ] .",
    "a power - law fit to the dcmf above this completeness limit yields an exponent @xmath2 .",
    "this slope agrees with the results of , which found @xmath110 for @xmath111 .",
    "slopes of @xmath112 are also commonly observed in other star - forming regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    the distribution of aspect ratios @xmath113 , which is defined as the ratio of the major vs.  the minor axis @xmath114 , is strongly skewed .",
    "the mode of the distribution is found to be @xmath115 , whereas the mean aspect ratio is found to be @xmath116 , with a dispersion of @xmath117 ( fig.[fig10 ] , _ left panel _ ) . within the region of our observations ,",
    "we find five cores from the sample of optically selected cores from @xcite .",
    "three of these cores were classified as round ( @xmath118 ) , and the remaining two had only moderate aspect ratios of @xmath119 . compared to the all - sky sample of 406  cores from @xcite with @xmath120 , the cores in taurus are therefore only moderately elongated .",
    "we also considered the orientation of the cores with respect to the filament . due to its meandering nature , this is not a trivial task .",
    "therefore , we first defined the baseline of the filament by setting points along its path , and then interpolated between these points using a cubic spline function .",
    "the orientation angle of the core with respect to this baseline was then obtained , and we find that the 39 cores seem to have a slight tendency to align with the filament .",
    "however , a ks - test results in a probability of @xmath121 that this distribution is drawn from a uniform distribution . given the large error bars on the individual orientations , which come along with the small aspect ratios , we can therefore not draw any secure conclusions about preferential or random core alignment in this filament .",

    "therefore , we followed a procedure similar to @xcite .",
    "the first step was to obtain visual extinctions @xmath127 of every star by converting color excesses @xmath128 and @xmath129 assuming the reddening law of @xcite .",
    "stars are then binned in the color - color diagram according to their extinction @xmath127 .",
    "these data points are then fitted according to equation([equ03 ] ) to obtain a corrected slope . with",
    "the aid of this new slope , corrected extinction values @xmath127 are then computed .",
    "this procedure is repeated until the slope @xmath126 converges , which generally happened after 3 - 6 iterations . in order to decrease dependence on the bin size , we repeated this procedure for bin sizes ranging from @xmath130{mag}\\ldots\\unit[1.5]{mag}$ ] in steps of @xmath131{mag}$ ] .",
    "the best fit slope @xmath126 was then the variance weighted mean from all runs with different bin sizes .    for this analysis we considered only sources classified as stars without any photometry flags .",
    "the best fit slope was found to be @xmath132 .",
    "this value is in very good agreement to the reddening laws of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath133 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath134 ) .",
    "due to its proximity , the taurus molecular cloud is an excellent target to study the connection between filamentary structure and star formation . in this paper",
    "we present a new , high - resolution view of the l1495 filament , allowing characterization of its density structure down to tenth - of - a - parsec scales . indeed , as illustrated in figs.[fig05]-[fig07 ] , l1495 shows a highly fragmented small - scale structure and in some places extinctions , which are higher than can be traced by the chosen technique ( i.e.  @xmath135{mag}$ ] ) .    to estimate the star - forming potential of the filament , we calculated the mass - per - length @xmath136 .",
    "for an undisturbed filament , filaments with a mass exceeding the critical value of @xmath137{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}\\,pc^{-1}}$ ] are prone to filamentary fragmentation and collapse @xcite . in presence of magnetic fields ,",
    "this critical value can be increased by a factor of 2 @xcite . due to the presence of dense cores",
    ", l1495 does not really fulfill the requirement of being an undisturbed filament .",
    "however , considering only the large scale structure , which was filtered out in the wavelet transform , we derived a value of @xmath138{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}\\,pc^{-1}}$ ] for the whole filament .",
    "as this must be seen as a lower limit , as some of the mass is already bound in the dense cores , this value underlines the star - forming potential of the filament .    in fig.[fig06 ] we show the previously known ysos .",
    "interestingly , while ysos are generally found close to dense cores in the filament , the bar - like b211 is completely devoid of them @xcite . given that the mass - per - length value in this particular region is also high ( @xmath139{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}\\,pc^{-1}}$ ] ) , and that it also harbors several h@xmath10co@xmath11 cores signifying the presence of high density gas ( @xmath140{cm^{-3}}$ ] ) , it can be argued to be well underway towards star formation .",
    "more insight into the assembly of material in the non - star - forming part of the filament can be gained by examining the distribution of column densities .",
    "therefore , in fig.[fig11 ] we compare the quiescent b211 with b213 , in which star formation has already occurred .",
    "the column density distribution of b213 shows a continuous decline towards higher extinctions .",
    "in contrast , b211 shows a flat plateau at intermediate extinctions , falling steeply at extinctions higher than @xmath141{mag}$ ] .",
    "this excess with respect to the column density distribution of b213 can be related particularly to _ inter - core _ regions .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig12 ] , which shows the contour of @xmath142{mag}$ ] for both b211 and b213 .",
    "clearly , in b213 such extinction range is related to cores , while in b211 it is more continuous and related to the material _ surrounding _ the cores .",
    "therefore , we suggest that b211 is not at all devoid of star - forming capability , but in an early stage of its evolution where the filament is fragmenting and the inter - core regions have not yet been cleared from material by accretion towards the cores . given the high mass reservoir in the filament , such fragmentation is inevitably leading to star formation in b211 .    in l1495e ,",
    "the star - forming part of the filament , we investigated the spatial distribution of ysos with respect to the filament .",
    "class  i and flat - spectrum sources are found at extinctions of @xmath143{mag}$ ] , which is higher compared to the extinctions at the positions of class  ii and iii ( @xmath144{mag}$ ] ) .",
    "the mean spatial separation of class  i and flat - spectrum sources from the filament was found to be only @xmath145{pc}$ ] , whereas older sources showed considerably larger mean distances . to verify whether this could be a pure evolutionary effect",
    ", we performed a simple monte carlo simulation to model the time dependence of the spatial distribution of sources .",
    "we distributed 10,000 test sources with a 3d velocity dispersion of @xmath131{km\\,s^{-1}}\\sim\\unit[0.2]{pc\\,myr^{-1}}$ ] along the baseline of the filament ( defined in  [ s - results_cores ] ) .",
    "the mean distance of sources from the filament was then measured as a function of time .",
    "the test sources started to show larger mean distances than class  i and flat - spectrum sources after @xmath6{myr}$ ] .",
    "a mean distance similar to that of class  ii and class  iii objects was reached after @xmath146{myr}$ ] , which is in good agreement with the evolutionary timescale of these sources @xcite .      in  [ s - results_cores ] , we defined and examined the dense core population in l1495e . to test whether these cores are gravitationally bound entities , one can estimate the bonnor - ebert critical mass @xcite @xmath147{cm^{-3}}}\\right)^{-1/2}\\,\\left(\\frac{t}{\\unit[10]{k}}\\right)^{3/2}\\,{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] within this framework , in cores with @xmath148 thermal motions do not provide enough support against gravity , and in the absence of other forces they inevitably collapse and form protostars . with a mean density of @xmath149{cm^{-3}}$ ] and a temperature of @xmath150{k}$ ] @xcite , we obtain @xmath151{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}}$ ] . calculating the bonnor - ebert critical mass for all cores",
    "allowed us to analyze the stability of each core separately ( fig.[fig13 ] ) . as a result",
    "we find that in l1495e , the majority of cores is prone to collapse . without exception ,",
    "all cores that coincide with a dense h@xmath10co@xmath11 core exhibit @xmath148 .",
    "apparently , in these cores the collapse has already led to a density enhancement , which can be traced by h@xmath10co@xmath11 with its critical density of @xmath152{cm^{-3}}$ ] .",
    "compared e.g.  to the starless core population in the pipe nebula ( @xmath153{cm^{-3}}$ ] , @xcite ) , the cores in the taurus filament are clearly denser by a factor of 2 .",
    "for the cores in the pipe nebula , the bonnor - ebert critical mass is @xmath154{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}}$ ] ( assuming @xmath150{k}$ ] ) , and only a few cores exceed this value and are prone to collapse . cores in taurus are also considerably more clustered than those in the pipe nebula .",
    "the nearest neighbor separation and two - point correlation function ( fig.[fig07 ] ) show a clear peak at separations of the order of @xmath83{pc}$ ] , whereas cores in the pipe nebula show separations of @xmath155{pc}$ ] @xcite .",
    "fragmentation in taurus happens mainly only on a very distinct spatial scale . in the case of thermal fragmentation",
    ", such a preferential length scale would be determined by the jeans length @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the local sound speed , @xmath158 the gravitational constant , and @xmath159 the mass density . assuming @xmath160{km\\,s^{-1}}$ ] ( @xmath150{k}$ ] ) and the mean mass density of our sample of cores ( @xmath161{g\\,cm^{-3}}$ ] ) we derive @xmath162{pc}$ ] , which is only slightly larger than the peak in the nearest neighbor distribution of @xmath83{pc}$ ] .",
    "this is in contrast to the pipe nebula with a separation of @xmath155{pc}$ ] @xcite , which exceeds its local jeans length ( @xmath163{pc}$ ] ) .",
    "we note that due to the unknown inclination angle @xmath164 we can only derive the _ projected _ nearest neighbor separation , but the true separation between cores remains unclear .",
    "for @xmath165 the true nearest neighbor separation would match the local jeans length .",
    "vlba observations allow accurate distance measurements of selected stars in the taurus molecular cloud exist @xcite , but do not allow to estimate of the true spatial orientation of the filament .",
    "we note , that non - zero inclination angles would not only affect the derived nearest neighbor separation , but also the aspect ratio .",
    "randomly oriented cores would yield the observed mean aspect ratio of @xmath116 , if the true aspect ratio is @xmath166 in the case of prolate , and @xmath167 for oblate cores , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , from a large set of dense cores and bok globules , @xcite argues that cores are generally rather prolate than oblate .",
    "this shape is furthermore supported by theoretical simulations @xcite , where helical magnetic fields are able to produce a population of prolate dense cores through filamentary fragmentation .",
    "the aspect ratios of these cores are in good agreement with the sample of @xcite , who finds @xmath168 . therefore , under the assumption of prolate cores , we find cores , which are slightly more spherical ( @xmath169 ) .",
    "the same trend is visible , when comparing the taurus cores from the sample of @xcite to their galactic average . whether this is truly the case , or",
    "simply a projectional effect can not be determined . due to the core formation in the filament",
    ", we do not expect our sample of cores to be oriented randomly , but rather inheriting some preferential direction .",
    "however , the meandering nature of the filament does not allow to determine a common inclination angle .",
    "considering these limitations , the elongation of our cores agrees reasonably well with theoretical predictions and other observations .",
    "in this paper , we study the star formation in the taurus filament l1495 .",
    "in particular we present a nir extinction map of this filament with unprecedented dynamical range ( @xmath170{mag}$ ] ) and resolution ( @xmath40{\\arcmin}$ ] ) .",
    "the main results of this paper are as follows :    1 .",
    "the extinction map of l1495 reveals the highly fragmented nature of the filament , harboring a population of dense cores preferentially separated by the local jeans length .",
    "the mass - per - length in the filament is @xmath0{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}\\,pc^{-1}}$ ] , indicative of its star - forming potential .",
    "we find , that the part of the filament that harbors no ysos , namely b211 , shows an internal structure different from that of the rest of the filament .",
    "we argue , that b211 is still younger than other parts of the filament , being still in process of filament fragmentation .",
    "given its high mass reservoir , star formation will inevitably ensue .",
    "the dense core population in l1495e was investigated in detail .",
    "a total of 39 dense cores with masses between @xmath95{{\\mathrm{m}_\\odot}}$ ] and densities of @xmath149{cm^{-3}}$ ] were found .",
    "the majority of these cores exceeds the critical mass for collapse @xmath171 , and is therefore prone to collapse .",
    "the high mass tail of the dcmf can be fitted with a power - law with an exponent @xmath2 , a form commonly observed also in other star - forming regions .",
    "we thank calar alto observatory for allocation of director s discretionary time to this programme .",
