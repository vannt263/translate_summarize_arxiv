    "many physical and biological systems under multi - component control mechanisms exhibit scale - invariant features characterized by long - range power - law correlations in their output .",
    "these scaling features are often difficult to quantify due to the presence of erratic fluctuations , heterogeneity , and nonstationarity embedded in the output signals .",
    "this problem becomes even more difficult in certain cases : ( i ) when we can not probe directly the quantity of interest in experimental settings , i.e. , the measurable output signal is a linear or nonlinear function of the quantity of interest ; ( ii ) when measuring devices impose a linear or nonlinear filter on the system s output ; ( iii ) when we are interested not in the output signal but in a specific component of it , which is obtained through a nonlinear transform ( e.g. , the magnitude or the sign of the fluctuations in the signal ) ; ( iv ) when comparing the dynamics of different systems by applying nonlinear transforms to their output signals ; or ( v ) when pre - processing the output signal by means of linear or nonlinear filters before the actual analysis .",
    "thus , to understand the intrinsic dynamics of a system , in such cases it is important to correctly analyze and interpret the dynamical patterns in the system s output .",
    "conventional two - point correlation , power spectrum , and hurst analysis methods are not suited for nonstationary signals , the statistical properties of which change with time  @xcite . to address this problem , detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) method was developed to accurately quantify long - range correlations embedded in a nonstationary time series @xcite .",
    "this method provides a single quantitative parameter  the scaling exponent @xmath9  to quantify the scale - invariant properties of a signal .",
    "one advantage of the dfa method is that it allows the detection of long - range power - law correlations in noisy signals with embedded polynomial trends that can mask the true correlations in the fluctuations of a signal .",
    "recent comparative studies have demonstrated that the dfa method outperforms conventional techniques in accurately quantifying correlation properties over a wide range of scales  .",
    "the dfa method has been widely applied to dna  , cardiac dynamics  , human electroencephalographic ( eeg ) fluctuations  @xcite , human motor activity  @xcite and gait  @xcite , meteorology  @xcite , climate temperature fluctuations  , river flow and discharge  @xcite , electric signals  @xcite , stellar x - ray binary systems  @xcite , neural receptors in biological systems  @xcite , music  @xcite , and economics  . in many of these applications",
    "the main problem is to differentiate scaling features in a system s output which are inherent to the underlying dynamics , from the scaling features which are an artifact of nonstationarities or different types of transforms and filters .    in two previous studies",
    "we have examined how different types of nonstationarities such as superposed sinusoidal and power - law trends , random spikes , cut - out segments , and patches with different local behavior affect the long - range correlation properties of signals  @xcite .",
    "here we use the dfa method to investigate how the scaling properties of noisy correlated signals change under linear and nonlinear transforms .",
    "further , ( i ) we test to see under what types of transforms ( filters ) it is possible to derive information about the scaling properties of the signal of interest before the transformation , provided we know the correlation behavior of the transformed ( filtered ) signal , and ( ii ) we probe the `` apparent '' scaling of three common transformation functions after applying the dfa method  exponential , logarithmic and polynomial .",
    "we also evaluate the limitations of the dfa method under linear and nonlinear transforms . specifically , we consider the following :    \\(1 ) _ correlation properties of signals after transforms of the type _ : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a stationary signal with _ a priori _ known correlation properties .",
    "\\(i ) _ linear transform _ : @xmath12 .",
    "transforms of this type are often encountered in physical systems .",
    "for example : ( a ) from the fluctuations in the acceleration of a particle ( measurable quantity ) , one can derive information about how the force ( quantity of interest ) acting on this particle changes in time without directly measuring the force : @xmath13 ; ( b ) in pnp - transistors a difficult to directly measure base ( input ) current @xmath14 ( quantity of interest ) is amplified hundreds of times , so that small fluctuations in @xmath14 may lead to significant ( and measurable ) changes in the collector ( output ) signal @xmath15 ( measurable quantity ) : @xmath16 , and ( c ) changes in the volume @xmath17 ( quantity of interest ) of an ideal gas can be determined from fluctuations in the temperature ( measurable quantity ) provided the pressure is kept constant : @xmath18 .",

    "further , linear and nonlinear polynomial filters are also used to renormalize data series representing an identical quantity measured in different systems before performing correlation analysis , e.g. , ( i ) normalizing heart rate recordings from different subjects to zero mean and unit standard deviation ( linear filters ) , or ( ii ) extracting the absolute value ( nonlinear filter ) of the heartbeat fluctuations in datasets obtained from different subjects  @xcite .    in this study",
    "we consider two examples of nonlinear polynomial filters  quadratic and cubic filters  which represent the class of polynomial filters with even and odd powers , and we investigate how these filters change the correlation properties of signals .",
    "since polynomial filters with even power wipe out the sign information in a signal , we expect quadratic and cubic filters to have a different effect . a recent study by y.  ashkenazy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows that the magnitude of a signal ( without sign information ) exhibits different correlation properties from that of the original signal .",
    "thus it is necessary to investigate how quadratic and cubic filters change the scaling properties of correlated signals .",
    "\\(iii ) _ logarithmic filter _ : @xmath26 , is also widely used in renormalizing datasets obtained from different sources before comparative analysis .",
    "for example , to compare the dynamics of price fluctuations @xmath27 of different company stocks , which may have a different average price , one often first obtains the relative price returns @xmath28 $ ] before performing correlation analysis  @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that upon taking the returns one does not alter the information contained in the original signal . to test this assumption we compare the correlation properties of the signal before and after a logarithmic filter .",
    "\\(2 ) _ correlation properties of transformation functions _    when analyzing the correlation properties of a signal after a given transform , it may be valuable to know what is the dfa result for the transformation function itself .",
    "in addition , it is often the case that noisy signals are superposed on trends which can be approximated by a certain function .",
    "previous studies have demonstrated that the dfa result of a correlated signal with a superposed trend is a superposition of the dfa result for the signal and the dfa result for the analytic function representing the trend  @xcite .",

    "the taylor expansion is :    @xmath125    similar to the case of the logarithmic function , this series is converging only when @xmath113 .",
    "following the same arguments as for the logarithmic function we find that when @xmath119 , the power - law function is converging in any dfa box , and thus can be approximated by a polynomial function , leading to the scaling exponent @xmath79 [ fig .",
    "[ trends1 ] ] , which is identical to the case of exponential and logarithmic function .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath126 , the power - law function is divergent in the first dfa box @xmath122 , as in the case of the logarithmic function , leading to a deviation in the scaling of @xmath33 for small values of @xmath8 [ fig .",
    "[ trends1 ] ] . while in the case of logarithmic function this divergence leads to a fixed scaling exponent @xmath82 , for power - law functions the value of the scaling exponent @xmath9 depends also on the power @xmath88 [ fig .  [ trends1 ] ] .",
    "we note that the above arguments can be used to estimate the results of the dfa method for other functions . for all functions which can be expanded in convergent taylor expansion of a polynomial form in each dfa box partitioning the function",
    ", the dfa method leads to identical scaling results with the exponent @xmath79 , which is a notable inherent limitation of the method . when there is divergent behavior in some or all of the dfa boxes partitioning a function , the dfa scaling exhibits crossover behavior to different values of the scaling exponent @xmath9 which depends on the functional form and the specific parameters of the function .",
    "in summary , our study shows that linear transforms do not change the scaling properties of a signal .",
    "however , the correlation properties of a signal change after applying a polynomial filter .",
    "moreover , such change depends on the type of correlations ( positive or anti - correlations ) in the signal , as well as on the power ( odd or even ) of the polynomial filter . for the logarithmic filter",
    "we find that the scaling behavior of the transformed signal remains unchanged only when the original signal satisfies certain type of correlations ( characterized by scaling exponent within a given range ) . comparing the `` apparent '' scaling behavior of the exponential , logarithmic , and power - law functions we find that within certain range for the values of the parameters , the dfa fluctuation function @xmath33 exhibits an identical slope , and that the dfa results of a class of other analytic functions can be reduced to these three cases .",
    "we attribute this behavior to specific limitations of the dfa method . therefore ,",

    "we consider an exponential function of the type @xmath127 , where the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath8 take on real values .",
