    "in the holographic construction of qcd - like gauge theories from type iia string theory @xcite , the elementary fields of the gauge theory are associated with the low - lying spectrum of open strings on @xmath5 coincident d4 branes and @xmath6 coincident d8 branes whose intersection is 4-dimensional spacetime .. gluons and quarks are represented by open d4-d4 and d4-d8 strings , respectively . in the closed string sector , the @xmath0 gauge field associated with the massless states of the ramond - ramond ( rr ) string plays a special role in reproducing the low energy chiral dynamics associated with topological charge in qcd @xcite . in the holographic theory , the qcd theta term arises from a 5-dimensional chern - simons term which couples the rr gauge potential to the topological charge of the color gauge field . a very useful way of understanding the origin of this chern - simons term and its implications for low energy hadron physics is to interpret it in terms of anomaly inflow @xcite . by standard arguments , the coupling of the rr field to the color gauge field on the d4 branes is dictated by the requirement that chiral anomalies on the brane , associated with the topological charge of the gauge field , should be cancelled in the higher dimensional bulk theory by the inflow of ramond - ramond flux .",
    "equivalently , in the presence of d - branes , the equations of motion and bianchi identity for the rr field must be modified to include electric and magnetic source terms on the world volume of the branes .",
    "the form of these source terms is dictated by the anomaly inflow argument , which determines the @xmath0 gauge variation of the rr field that must accompany a yang - mills gauge transformation in order to define a gauge invariant rr field strength . in terms of the rr potential @xmath7 ,",
    "the gauge invariant field strength is no longer just @xmath8 , but must include a yang - mills source term on the d4 branes proportional to the chern - simons current of the color gauge field .    in order to account for nonzero topological susceptibility , there must be a massless pole in the correlation function of two chern - simons currents with residue equal to @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this does not imply a massless physical particle , since the chern - simons current is not gauge invariant . on the other hand",
    ", this pole does have a direct physical significance , in that it gives rise to a delta - function contact term in the gauge invariant topological charge correlator .",
    "such a contact term is expected on general principles @xcite .",
    "since all real intermediate state contributions to @xmath9 ( as computed from the integrated euclidean correlator ) are negative , the correlator must be dominated by a positive contact term .",
    "the presence of such a contact term has been confirmed by lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo results showed that this contact term is the result of a laminated vacuum structure consisting of interleaved , alternating - sign codimension one sheets of topological charge @xcite . from a holographic viewpoint ,",
    "the massless pole required in the chern - simons current correlator to obtain finite topological susceptibility is associated with the exchange of a massless ramond - ramond gauge boson .",
    "the ramond - ramond field is a holographic description of the fluctuations of the topological charge membranes @xcite .",
    "the physical manifestation of rr gauge boson exchange in pure glue qcd at low energy is the appearance of a contact term in the gauge invariant topological charge corrrelator .",
    "we find other interesting phenomenological effects of rr exchange by considering open - string / closed - string duality ( os / cs ) for quark loops .",
    "the quark is represented by an open string attached at one end to a color d4 brane and at the other end to a flavor d8 brane . a closed quark loop in the field theory is represented by a one - loop open string diagram which can be reinterpreted via os / cs duality as the tree - level exchange of a closed ramond - ramond string between the flavor branes and the color branes ( see fig . [ fig : d4d8string ] ) .",
    "this provides an interesting separation between the flavor and color structure of the quark loop .",
    "this closed - string description of a quark loop is particularly appropriate for discussing its ultraviolet behavior , which is determined in the string theory by low - energy structure in the closed string channel . just as anomaly inflow arguments can be used to determine the coupling of the rr field to the color branes , similar arguments determine the rr coupling to the flavor branes @xcite . in this case",
    ", anomaly inflow relates the rr gauge field to the @xmath0 chiral goldstone ( @xmath1 ) field , giving the familiar equivalence between a shift of @xmath10 and a chiral rotation . by arguments similar to those leading to the contact term in the topological charge correlator",
    ", we show that rr exchange between quark lines induces an effective 4-quark contact term . in the flavor singlet channel for quark - antiquark scattering ,",
    "s - channel rr exchange provides the @xmath1 mass insertion quark diagram ( `` double hairpin '' graph , fig .",
    "[ fig : hairpin ] ) .",
    "in addition to reproducing the witten - veneziano relation for the @xmath1 mass @xcite , the rr exchange picture provides an explanation of the pure double pole behavior observed in monte carlo calculations of the quenched double - hairpin correlator @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that at large @xmath5 , chiral lagrangian arguments @xcite lead to a specific form for the effective action term which correctly describes the axial @xmath0 anomaly .",
    "this term must have the form of a pure @xmath1 mass insertion : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13 chiral field .",
    "this large @xmath5 expectation is quite distinct from the effective action induced by instantons , which would be proportional to the chiral determinant itself and therefore include ozi - violating six - quark interactions .",
    "we will show that an effective action of the form ( [ eq : u1breaking ] ) is exactly what is expected from the 4-quark contact term generated by rr exchange .",
    "this follows essentially from the fact that the rr field couples , by anomaly inflow , to the @xmath0 phase of the chiral field .",
    "thus , the anomaly term ( [ eq : u1breaking ] ) is interpreted as describing a contact term generated by rr exchange between two chiral densities .",
    "in addition to its role in qcd topological susceptibility and the @xmath1 mass insertion , rr exchange may also play a direct role in spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the formation of the chiral condensate .",
    "the @xmath1 mass insertion arises from the @xmath14-@xmath15 annihilation diagram ( figure [ fig : hairpin ] ) , i.e. s - channel rr exchange .",
    "this diagram appears only in the flavor singlet channel and explicitly breaks axial @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "but there is also a 4-quark contact term generated by rr exchange in the t - channel of the quark - antiquark amplitude ( figure [ fig : valence ] ) .",
    "this interaction is the same for flavor singlet and nonsinglet channels .",
    "it is a @xmath16 conserving nambu - jona lasinio - type interaction , suggesting that rr exchange may be the driving force behind @xmath17 .",
    "finding that topological fluctuations play a role in the formation of the chiral condensate would not be that surprising .",
    "an analogous mechanism in the framework of the instanton liquid model has been discussed @xcite . in that model ,",
    "the thooft near - zero modes of the instantons provide the eigenstates occupied by the quarks in the chiral condensate .",
    "similarly , in a vacuum of topological charge membranes ( d6 branes ) , the chiral condensate forms from the surface modes of the quarks on the codimension one brane surfaces .",
    "rr exchange in the t channel provides an attractive interaction between a d6 brane and a neighboring anti - d6 brane , and hence an attractive quark - antiquark interaction .",
    "the origin of the qcd theta term was first discussed in the holographic framework in ref . @xcite . in witten s",
    "construction , the color d4 branes are compactified around an @xmath18 with susy breaking boundary conditions .",
    "the qcd theta term arises from a 5-dimensional chern - simons term which couples the wilson line of the rr gauge potential @xmath7 to the topological charge density of the color d4 brane gauge field , @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is a trace over color indices . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and discussed below , the form of the chern - simons term is dictated by anomaly inflow arguments . in the full iia string theory , this term represents the fact that fluctuations of the color gauge fields on the d4 brane can absorb and emit closed rr string states which propagate in the bulk . in the field theory limit , after compactification around the @xmath18 ( with the circumference of the @xmath18 playing a role analogous to lattice spacing in lattice qcd ) , the surviving part of this chern - simons term is proportional to the rr wilson line around the compact direction , @xmath21 here we denote 4-dimensional spacetime coordinates by @xmath22 . if @xmath10 is a spacetime constant @xmath23 , the cs term reduces to a qcd theta term , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is 4-dimensional spacetime . as shown by witten @xcite , topological fluctuations in the 4-dimensional gauge theory at large @xmath5",
    "should be in the form of domain walls , i.e. codimension one membranes , which are described by wrapped d6 branes in the string theory .",
    "this can be contrasted with an instanton liquid model , which would correspond to d0 brane excitations . with respect to the 10-dimensional rr u(1 ) gauge field ,",
    "d0 branes and d6 branes can be regarded as electric and magnetic sources , respectively . from this point of view ,",
    "the transition from the perturbative to the physical , confining vacuum is caused by a condensation of magnetic ramond - ramond charge into alternating - sign layers @xcite . in the large-@xmath5 physical vacuum , populated by d6 branes , the role of the chern - simons term ( [ eq : chern - simons ] )",
    "is crucial even when the overall qcd theta parameter is set to zero .",
    "in fact , in the presence of magnetic d6 brane sources , the rr potential @xmath7 can not be uniquely specified globally , but must be defined in terms of overlapping sections , as with dirac monopoles in 4d maxwell theory . because of this nonuniquenes of @xmath7 , it is more meaningful to write the chern - simons term in the form obtained by integrating by parts , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the 3-form satisfying @xmath28",
    ". specifically , @xmath29 here and elsewhere the color gauge field potential on the d4 branes is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "the d8 brane gauge potential will be called @xmath31 .",
    "we associate the 3-form ( [ eq : cs3form ] ) with the 3-dimensional intersection between the d4 branes and the d6 brane .",
    "we will choose axes in 4d spacetime such that the d4-d6 `` i - brane '' intersection spans the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 coordinates , with @xmath35 being the spacetime direction transverse to the i - brane ( and hence transverse to the topological charge membranes of the color gauge field ) .",
    "( from detailed monte carlo studies @xcite , the topological charge membranes are expected to be locally flat over a distance scale comparable to the confinemenet scale . over larger distances , the branes bend and fold and their orientation decorrelates . ) in the construction of ref .",
    "@xcite , the three dimensions transverse to the d6 brane consist of the holographic ( radial ) direction @xmath36 , the compact @xmath18 ( angular ) direction @xmath37 , and one spacetime direction , which we take to be @xmath35 .",
    "this 3d space can be represented as a solid cylider , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : laughlin ] .",
    "the d6 brane is a point magnetic rr charge in this space , and the construction of a nonsingular gauge potential which is continuous away from the source requires @xmath7 to be defined separately on two disks or hemispheres on opposite sides of the d6 brane and matched together by a topologically nontrivial @xmath0 gauge transformation around the equator , leading to the quantization of d6 brane charge . by eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta ] ) , this quantization enforces the fact that the value of @xmath38 on opposite sides of the d6 brane must differ by an integer multiple of @xmath39 .",
    "so , rather than reducing to a constant theta parameter in the field theory limit , @xmath40 becomes an integer valued field which jumps by @xmath41 at the location of a d6 brane . with the chern - simons action written in the form ( [ eq : cs2 ] ) , the codimension one topological charge membrane in the color gauge field appears at the intersection of the d6 brane and the d4 branes , where low - mass open d4-d6 strings reside .",
    "open - string / closed - string duality implies a coupling due to massless rr exchange between d4 and d6 brane . just as an instanton in the gauge theory",

    "we have seen that an anomaly inflow requirement on the color branes led to the result that only the combination of operators in ( [ eq : g2 ] ) is invariant under a color gauge transformation .",
    "a similar anomaly inflow argument on the flavor - brane end of the quark string leads to the usual identification of the chiral @xmath0 phase and the theta parameter , which can be seen as follows : the gauge invariant ramond - ramond field strength in the presence of d8 branes is given by @xcite @xmath86 ( the factor @xmath87 here comes from the leading term in the expansion of the general chern - simons interaction of the form @xmath88 . ) note that here a quark is an electric source of @xmath43 , while in ( [ eq : g2 ] ) , the topological charge membrane is a magnetic source .",

    "however , because the flavor string - ends do nt participate , this diagram does not depend on whether the initial quark and antiquark were on the same or different flavor branes , i.e. whether the meson is a flavor singlet or nonsinglet .",
    "thus , the effective interaction from t - channel rr exchange , fig .",
    "[ fig : valence](b ) should be @xmath16 invariant .",
    "note that the @xmath121 anomaly term includes both a @xmath0 conserving term @xmath122 and a @xmath0 violating term @xmath123 . by",
    "adding scalar @xmath124 interactions to cancel the @xmath0 violating terms , we are led to an effective action for t - channel rr exchange of the form @xmath125 here we defer a quantitative analysis to a subsequent paper and simply observe that the suggested form for t - channal rr exchange has the standard form of a @xmath16 preserving nambu - jona lasinio interaction @xcite .",
    "( a similar mechanism for generating an njl interaction in holographic qcd by integrating out the compactified component of the d4 brane gauge field has been discussed in @xcite . )",
    "njl models have an extensive and highly successful phenomenology .",
    "note that , although the interaction ( [ eq : t - channelrr ] ) is pure flavor singlet in the t - channel , the fierz transformed expression describes a @xmath16 invariant interaction in the s - channel which is equal for flavor singlet and nonsinglet channels . in the usual njl bethe - salpeter analysis",
    ", this will produce massless pions in the nonsinglet channels .",
    "it is a longstanding idea in qcd that topological charge fluctuations are responsible not only for resolving the @xmath0 problem but also for driving the spontaneous breaking of @xmath4 and forming the chiral condensate @xcite .",
    "previous discussions of topological charge driven @xmath17 have been framed in the context of the instanton liquid picture , in which the approximate thooft zero modes of the instantons form the chiral condensate @xcite . from a slightly different viewpoint , carlitz et al @xcite argued that instantons would generate an attractive njl quark - antiquark interaction which could drive @xmath17 .",
    "the rr exchange picture presented here suggests a reformulation of topological charge driven chiral symmetry breaking in the framework of holographic qcd .",
    "in many respects , the holographic framework for qcd provides an alternative to a lattice cutoff .",
    "the monte carlo evidence @xcite that the qcd vacuum is dominated by a laminated array of topological charge membranes fits very naturally into the holographic framework @xcite .",
    "the lattice studies show clearly that the spacing between the alternating - sign membranes is fairly regular and of order a few lattice spacings , and remaining roughly constant in lattice units for a range of correlation lengths @xcite .",
    "this implies that the scaling limit of qcd follows a non - landau - ginsburg paradigm , similar to that of antiferromagnetic systems , where alternating substructure at the lattice spacing scale can give rise to topological excitations in the scaling limit . in the holographic formulation ,",
    "the ramond - ramond gauge field describes the collective fluctuations of the layered arrangement of d6 and @xmath126 branes .",
    "the chern - simons current @xmath75 of the color gauge field is related by anomaly inflow to @xmath127 , i.e to the @xmath128 component of the rr field strength . when crossing a d6 brane , @xmath38 jumps by @xmath39 , representing the net outgoing rr flux from the charged d6 brane . by anomaly inflow",
    ", this discontinuity must coincide with the topological charge membrane of the color gauge field , represented in field theory by a `` wilson bag '' integral of the chern - simons 3-form @xmath27 over the 3-dimensional world volume of the bag surface .",
    "the @xmath129 pole in the @xmath75 correlator combines with the massless pole in the rr correlator in a kogut - susskind dipole mechanism . in the k - s dipole for the 2d schwinger model , the gauge invariant axial vector current operator describes the motion of a charged fermion along with its attached gauge field .",
    "the massless pole in the conserved ( non - gauge invariant ) current matrix element is cancelled by the ghost pole describing the gauge field propagation . in holographic qcd the k - s dipole mechanism connects the motion of a charged d6 brane , represented by a @xmath39 discontinuity in @xmath38 , with the topological charge membrane excitation in the color gauge field , represented by the chern - simons operator @xmath27 .",
    "it may seem that the appearance of the ramond - ramond field , in the form of a spacetime dependent @xmath38 , represents an additional degree of freedom in the holographic framework compared to , say lattice qcd , where @xmath10 is assumed to be a constant @xmath23 ( usually zero ) .",
    "but in fact the spacetime dependent @xmath38 , which is constant between d6 branes with a @xmath130 discontinuity at the brane surfaces , can be interpreted as a singular gauge transformation which smoothly connects the color fields on opposite sides of the brane .",
    "note that the wilson bag operator , given by the integral of @xmath27 over a codimension one surface in spacetime is the gauge field operator which effectively inserts a discontinuity in @xmath10 .",
    "( for example , a wilson bag operator over a closed surface is equivalent to a theta term in the interior of the bag , since @xmath131 . ) .",
    "thus , in a purely 4-dimensional yang - mills framework the rr field @xmath38 can be regarded as an auxilary field which separates off the singular , sheet - like excitations in the yang - mills field and treats their dynamics separately .",
    "the requirement of overall gauge invariance of the rr field strength removes the redundancy of the auxiliary field and locks the motion of the @xmath38 discontinuities to that of the topological charge membranes of the yang - mills field .",
    "it is very clear from monte carlo studies @xcite that these singular , sheet - like gauge excitations are responsible for the positive contact term that appears in the euclidean topological charge correlator . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that such a contact term is the expected low - energy manifestation of ramond - ramond gauge boson exchange .",
    "this effect appears not only in the topological charge correlator , but also in the anomaly - induced 4-quark contact term that produces an @xmath1 `` hairpin '' mass insertion .",
    "we also discussed the possibility that rr exchange in the t - channel of quark - antiquark scattering generates a @xmath16 symmetric nambu - jona lasinio type interaction which could be responsible for the formation of the quark condensate .",
    "this provides an appealing physical picture of spontaneous @xmath4 breaking and goldstone boson propagation and its relation to vacuum topological charge structure in gauge theory .",
    "the picture that emerges is of a left handed chiral condensate of @xmath132 living on the surfaces of the d6 branes interleaved with sheets of right - handed @xmath133 on the surfaces of the anti - d6 branes .",
    "this is reminiscent of the instanton liquid model , in which left and right condensate modes lived on instantons and antiinstantons , respectively , averageing out to a @xmath134 condensate .",
    "but a crucial difference for the d6 brane condensate is that the quarks modes in the condensate are delocalized along codimension one sheets instead of being thooft zero modes confined to localized lumps .",
    "this provides a much more natural mechanism for goldstone boson propagation than the mode - mixing or `` hopping '' that must be invoked in instanton liquid models ."
