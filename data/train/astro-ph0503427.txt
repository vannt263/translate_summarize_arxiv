    "from its inception , the schwarzschild solution of einstein s equations has been the subject of controversy over the possibility of compressing matter within the gravitational radius @xmath0 . given the accumulated evidence for supermassive compact objects ranging from a few @xmath1 to a few @xmath2 , the existence of black - hole - like objects is beyond doubt @xcite what does remain",
    "an issue is whether the schwarzschild metric correctly describes the physics of the interior .",
    "alternatives to classical black holes have been proposed with no singularities in the interior @xcite .",
    "the simplest model proposed for supermassive compact objects at the galactic centers is a self - gravitating degenerate fermion gas composed of , e.g. , heavy sterile neutrinos @xcite however , this scenario can not cover the whole mass range of supermassive black - hole candidates with a single sterile neutrino species @xcite .",
    "recently , chapline et al @xcite put forth an interesting proposal based on analogies to condensed matter systems where the effective general relativity was an emergent phenomenon .",
    "specifically , they suggested that the sphere where the lapse function vanished marked a quantum phase transition , the lapse function increasing again at @xmath3 .",
    "as this required negative pressure , the authors of @xcite assumed the interior vacuum condensate to be described by de sitter space with the equation of state @xmath4 .",
    "subsequently , the idea of gravitational vacuum condensate , or ` gravastar ' , was taken up by mazur and mottola @xcite , replacing the horizon with a shell of stiff matter astride the surface at @xmath5 .",
    "visser and wiltshire @xcite and recently carter @xcite also examined the stability of the gravastar using the israel thin shell formalism @xcite . despite the fact that general relativity is an emergent phenomenon in string theory @xcite ,",
    "the gravastar has met with a cool reception .",
    "certainly , the assumption of a de sitter interior presents a quandary : on the one hand , the quantum phase transition would suggest that the associated cosmological constant is a fundamental parameter ; on the other hand , to accommodate the mass range of supermassive black hole candidates , it must vary over some six orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , it seems prudent to explore other possibilities for the gravastar interior .",
    "one obvious extension of the de sitter equation of state @xmath6 would be an equation that satisfies @xmath7 , thus violating the dominant energy condition .",
    "the fluid of which the equation of state violates the dominant energy condition has been dubbed _ phantom energy _",
    "@xcite and has recently become a popular alternative to quintessence and to the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the motivation for introducing the phantom energy is that the equation of state @xmath8 produces a superaccelerated cosmological expansion which seems to be favored by the combined analysis of the cmb and super nova type i data @xcite .",
    "however , a superaccelerated expansion may also be obtained without violating the dominant energy condition in scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite and in models with variable gravitational constant @xcite or variable cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "some astrophysical aspects of the phantom have recently been discussed , such as phantom energy accretion @xcite , phantom energy wormholes @xcite , and a possible relation of the phantom tachyon model to supermassive black holes @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a gravastar interior consisting of a self - gravitating scalar field described by a born - infeld type lagrangian which yields the chaplygin gas equation of state @xcite .",
    "hence , we look for static solutions of the self - gravitating chaplygin gas . in particular , we consider static chaplygin gas configurations in the phantom regime , i.e. , when @xmath9 , and we show that these configurations could provide an alternative scenario for compact massive objects at galactic centers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we introduce the basics of the model . in section",
    "[ static ] we investigate static solutions using tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations . in section [ galactic ]",
    "we discuss a possible interpretation of galactic centers as born - infeld phantom gravastars .",
    "a stability analysis is given in section [ stability ] and we conclude the paper by section [ conclude ]",
    "consider the equation of state @xmath10 in the phantom regime , i.e. , when @xmath11 equation ( [ eq006 ] ) describes the chaplygin gas which , for @xmath12 , has attracted some attention as a dark energy candidate @xcite .",
    "astrophysical objects made of the so - called _ generalized chaplygin gas _",
    "@xcite have recently been discussed @xcite .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas has also been exploited in the phantom regime @xcite .",
    "as we shall shortly demonstrate , static solutions to einstein s equations with matter described by ( [ eq006 ] ) with ( [ eq106 ] ) cover the range of masses and radii required to fit the phenomenology of supermassive dark compact objects at the galactic centers . moreover , eq . ( [ eq006 ] )",
    "yields the de sitter gravastar solution in the limit when the central density of the static solution approaches the value @xmath13 .",
    "the chaplygin gas equation of state ( [ eq006 ] ) with the condition @xmath14 may be derived from the dirac - born - infeld type lagrangian @xmath15 where @xmath16 clearly , in the limit @xmath17 this lagrangian becomes a free scalar field lagrangian with a  wrong sign \" kinetic term , hence a phantom .",
    "a phantom lagrangian of the type ( [ eq015 ] ) has been proposed in the context of the superaccelerated expansion @xcite .",
    "note that the lagrangian ( [ eq015 ] ) leads to a perfect fluid with the four - velocity @xmath18 the pressure @xmath19 , and the density @xmath20 clearly , the pressure and the density obey eq .",
    "( [ eq006 ] ) and @xmath21 .",
    "it is worth noting that the chaplygin gas cosmological model @xcite , in which the condition @xmath22 holds , is described by the lagrangian ( [ eq015 ] ) with a ( @xmath23 ) sign in front of @xmath24 .",
    "it is as though instead of the lapse function changing its sign , as it does in the schwarzschild case for @xmath25 , the scalar kinetic energy changed its sign to become a phantom .",
    "equivalent to @xmath26 of eq .",
    "( [ eq015 ] ) is @xmath27 as may be seen by eliminating @xmath28 through its equation of motion .",
    "now recall that in four dimensions , a three - form field strength is dual to a scalar : @xmath29 then the content of the model is @xmath30 notably , this is also the content of low - energy string theory @xcite in the einstein frame where @xmath31 is the kalb - ramond field , @xmath28 corresponds to the string coupling and the dilaton kinetic term is neglected in lieu of a potential assumed to arise from non - perturbative effects and @xmath32 to be schwarzschild . ] . a potential similar to that in ( [ eq019 ] ) and ( [ eq021 ] ) has been considered in the context of polymer scaling and black holes @xcite .",
    "next , we proceed to solve einstein s equations for a static , spherically symmetric configuration with an interior described by ( [ eq006 ] ) and with a schwarzschild exterior .",
    "our approach is similar to that of armendariz - picon and lim @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to us , they consider the classes of lagrangian with strictly space - like gradient of @xmath33 , i.e. with @xmath34 , so that in their case the quantity ( [ eq016 ] ) can not be interpreted as a four velocity . as a consequence ,",
    "their energy - momentum tensor does not have a standard perfect fluid form and the pressure is not isotropic . here , we consider strictly time - like gradient of @xmath33 with @xmath35 , but we allow phantom - like lagrangians which violate the dominant energy condition .",
    "for the static , spherically symmetric line element @xmath36 with @xmath37 , einstein s equations become @xcite @xmath38 @xmath39 while @xmath40 gives @xmath41 we focus on the equation of state ( [ eq006 ] ) to close the system and we require the solution to ( [ eq003 ] ) and ( [ eq004 ] ) to be regular at @xmath42 .",
    "since by rescaling @xmath43 one may set @xmath44 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq006 ] ) and ( [ eq005 ] ) yield @xmath45 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq006 ] ) , ( [ eq004 ] ) , and ( [ eq005 ] ) , one has @xmath46    in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] , and [ fig3 ] , respectively , we exhibit the resulting @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for selected values of @xmath50 .",
    "the solutions depend essentially on the magnitude of @xmath51 relative to @xmath13 . in the following",
    "we summarize the properties of three classes of solutions corresponding to whether @xmath51 is larger , smaller , or equal to @xmath13 .",
    "* i ) * for @xmath52 , the density @xmath53 increases and the lapse function @xmath54 decreases with @xmath55 starting from the origin up to the black - hole horizon radius @xmath56 , where @xmath57 . in the limit @xmath58 , a limiting solution exists with a singular behavior @xmath59 near the origin .    *",
    "ii ) * for @xmath60 , both @xmath53 and @xmath54 decrease with @xmath55 up to the radius @xmath61 where they vanish . at that point",
    "the pressure @xmath62 blows up to @xmath63 owing to ( [ eq006 ] ) .",
    "the enclosed mass @xmath64 is always less than @xmath65 , never reaching the black - hole horizon , i.e. , the radius where @xmath66 .",
    "* iii ) * for @xmath67 , the density @xmath53 remains constant equal to @xmath13 up to the de sitter radius @xmath68 .",
    "hence , the interior is de sitter , precisely as in chapline et al .",
    "the lapse function is given by @xmath69 with @xmath70    as @xmath71 from above or from below , solutions * i ) * or * ii ) * , respectively , converge to * iii ) * except at the endpoint .",
    "the lapse function in * iii ) * joins the schwarzschild solution outside @xmath72 continuously , whereas in * i ) * and * ii ) * it happens discontinuously .",
    "as in the case of a de sitter gravastar , in order to join our interior solutions to a schwarzschild exterior at a spherical boundary of radius @xmath73 , it is necessary to put a thin spherical shell at the boundary with a surface density and a surface tension satisfying israel s junction conditions @xcite . in all the solutions discussed above the pressure",
    "is isotropic and does not vanish at the boundary . hence , the pressure at the boundary must be compensated by a negative surface tension of the membrane .",
    "we postpone this issue for section [ stability ] where we discuss the stability of the solution .",
    "case * ii ) * , together with * iii ) * , is of particular interest as we would like to interpret the supermassive compact dark objects at the galactic centers in terms of phantom energy rather than in terms of a classical black hole .",
    "it is natural to assume that the most massive such object is described by the de sitter gravastar , i.e. , solution * iii ) * ( depicted by the solid line in figs . 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .",
    "if we identify the most massive black - hole candidate observed at the center of m87 , with mass @xmath74 , with the de sitter gravastar , then @xmath75 , to be contrasted with the @xmath76 values wanted for cosmology @xcite .",
    "the radius of this object is @xmath77 equal to the schwarzschild radius @xmath78 .",
    "clearly , solutions belonging to class * ii ) * , can fit all masses @xmath79 .",
    "however , for the phenomenology of supermassive galactic centers it is important to find , at least approximately , the mass - radius relationship for these solutions .",
    "this may be done in the low central density approximation , i.e. , @xmath80 , which is similar to the newtonian approximation but , in contrast to the newtonian approximation , one can not neglect the pressure term in eq .",
    "( [ eq004 ] ) .",
    "moreover , as may be easily shown , in this approximation @xmath81 , so that the pressure term becomes dominant .",
    "next , neglecting @xmath82 with respect to @xmath55 , as in the usual newtonian approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq008 ] ) simplifies to @xmath83 , [ eq201 ] with the solution @xmath84 which gives a mass - radius relation @xmath85 the mass - radius relationship @xmath86 which phantom gravastars obey , offers the prospect of unifying the description of all supermassive compact dark objects that have been observed at the galactic centers , as born - infeld phantom gravastars with masses ranging from @xmath87 to @xmath88 . indeed , assuming that the most massive compact dark object , observed at the center of m87 , is a born - infeld phantom gravastar near the black - hole limit , with @xmath89 , the compact dark object at the center of our galaxy , with mass @xmath90 ,",
    "would have a radius @xmath91 = 2.06 lhr if the scaling law ( [ eq205 ] ) holds .",
    "this radius is well below the distances of the closest approach to sgr a@xmath92 which the stars so-2 ( @xmath93 = 17 lhr = 123 au , @xcite ) and so-16 ( @xmath93 = 8.32 lhr = 60 au @xcite ) recently had and beyond which the keplerian nature of the gravitational potential of sgr a@xmath92 is well established .",
    "none of the solutions discussed in the preceding section will be stable unless there is a membrane , e.g. in the form of a thin shell , placed at the boundary with surface density @xmath94 and surface tension @xmath95 satisfying israel s junction conditions . following visser and wiltshire @xcite we consider a dynamical thin shell allowed to move radially at the boundary of the phantom gravastar and discuss under which conditions will a gravastar configuration will be stable .",
    "a dynamical thin shell connecting two general static spherically symmetric spacetimes have also recently been considered @xcite in a slightly different context .",

    "the angular components of the extrinsic curvature may be easily calculated from ( [ eq109 ] ) yielding @xmath106 precisely as in @xcite , where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the proper time and where @xmath107 the calculation of the time - time component @xmath108 is slightly more involved and is most easily done following israel @xcite . by making use of the gauss normal coordinates and orthogonality from ( [ eq109 ] ) it follows @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the four - velocity of a point on the shell .",
    "its non - vanishing components for the metric ( [ eq002 ] ) are @xmath111 similarly , the non - vanishing components of @xmath104 are @xmath112 using these expressions it may be shown that the four - acceleration @xmath113 satisfies @xcite @xmath114 a straightforward calculation yields @xmath115 .",

    ". the shell will be stable against small radial perturbation if there exists an equilibrium position @xmath123 such that @xmath124 then , by choosing a suitable potential @xmath122 , equations ( [ eq301 ] ) and ( [ eq302 ] ) define a parametric equation of state @xmath125 for the shell .    for the static shell and the metric ( [ eq002 ] ) we find @xmath126 and with the help of eq .",
    "( [ eq004 ] ) we obtain @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the total mass .",
    "note that if the joining is affected at the point @xmath61 where @xmath129 and @xmath62 is infinite ( the point of naked singularity @xcite ) , the surface density @xmath94 is finite , whereas the surface tension @xmath130 .",
    "hence , to avoid the singularity the shell must be placed at some @xmath131 .    for the newtonian gravastars discussed in the preceding section , equations ( [ eq301 ] ) and ( [ eq302 ] ) may be considerably simplified . using ( [ eq202 ] ) , the approximation @xmath132 , and assuming that the boundary radius @xmath73 is close to @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath133 we find @xmath134 @xmath135 in general , the potential @xmath136 is a function of both @xmath61 and @xmath137 , depending on the chosen equation of state @xmath125 .",
    "the dynamical stability is achieved if for any @xmath61 , @xmath136 has a minimum at some point @xmath138 which should not depend strongly on @xmath61 and at which @xmath139 .",

    "a posteriori_. static stability ( indifferent balance ) is obtained by setting @xmath140 .",
    "depending on the potential @xmath141 , this may still be a complicated parametric equation of state .",
    "however , for the static shell , i.e. @xmath140 , the equation of state simplifies to @xmath142 this equation describes a 2-dimensional generalized anti - chaplygin gas @xcite with the equation of state of the form @xmath143 , with @xmath144 .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that replacing the de sitter interior of the gravastar by a born - infeld phantom allows a wide range of gravastar mass and radii related to the central density , or equivalently to the velocity of the phantom scalar .",
    "we have demonstrated that if the constant @xmath145 , as the only free parameter of the model , is fixed by assuming that the most massive galactic center object is the maximal ( de sitter ) gravastar , then the model is able to explain all supermassive compact dark objects at the center of the galaxies .",
    "furthermore , as demonstrated above , the phantom gravastar model can lay claim to a connection with low - energy string theory .",
