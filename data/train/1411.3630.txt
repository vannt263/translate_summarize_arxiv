    "probing spin excitations on surfaces is a major focus of recently developed state of the art experimental techniques : spin polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy ( speels )  @xcite or inelastic scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( ists )  @xcite allow , for example , to map partly the excited spectra of thin films and even nano - structures down to single adatoms on surfaces .",
    "all information on spin - excitations is encoded in the magnetic response of a material , but once probed experimentally it is dressed up differently depending on the measurement technique .",
    "this explains the theoretical efforts , thriven by these experimental achievements , in developing methods that permit to simulate the dynamical transverse magnetic susceptibility , @xmath1 , that , in linear response , describes the amplitude of the transverse spin motion produced by an external magnetic field of frequency @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the excitations spectrum hinges on the details of the electronic structure of the probed material , hybridization of electronic states and magnetization .    within speels or ists , surface spin waves or localized spin",
    "excitations are excited via an exchange scattering process involving either a spin - polarized monochromatic electron beam or a tunneling current that interact with the sample .",
    "a gap in the dispersion curve of the spin waves ( difficult to observe with actual speels ) or in the ists signal is the signature of symmetry breaking induced by spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) or by an external magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "for single adatoms on non - magnetic substrates , the observed resonances , experimentally and theoretically , are located at the larmor energy given by @xmath4 with an effective spectroscopic splitting factor surprisingly different from 2  @xcite .",
    "the lifetime ( damping ) of the spin - excitations and @xmath0-shifts are the results of the coupling to stoner ( electron - hole pairs ) excitations that change depending on the magnitude of the applied magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath0-shifts were recognized since the early days of ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy ( fmr )  @xcite and were related to the presence of soc  @xcite .",
    "contrary to fmr , ists probes the magnetic response locally instead of the full system . in this particular case",
    ", mills and lederer  @xcite predicted that @xmath0 can be different from 2 even without soc .",
    "indeed , during spin - precession , the surrounding bath of electrons are perturbed and spin - currents are emitted .",
    "the local response naturally differs from the global response as expected in the spin - pumping context .    to calculate dynamical magnetic quantities from ab initio",
    ", one uses either time - dependent density functional theory ( td dft )  @xcite or many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) coupled to dft  @xcite . since the calculation of such quantities is a computational burden , their accessibility is limited  @xcite .",
    "the goal of our manuscript is to present an attractive scheme wherein simple equations derived within td dft allow to calculate dynamic properties just by computing _",
    "static _ quantities defined at the fermi energy ; this is reasonable within linear response theory .",
    "thus , our formulation can be implemented without tremendous efforts .",
    "a byproduct of our analysis is a simple formulation of the damping , local or non - local in space , of the spin - excitations .",
    "we note that the relation between the damping and the electronic structure has been predicted earlier  @xcite . moreover , several proposals ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) have been made to calculate the phenomenological damping parameter , @xmath5 , used to couple the precession of the moment to a reservoir when solving landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equations  @xcite .",
    "calculations based on first - principles were also performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , with a focus on @xmath5 but not on the full magnetic response function .    in our work",
    ", we derive furthermore a physically transparent form of the effective @xmath0-factor defining the response of the system to an external magnetic field .",
    "we relate its shift to the electronic structure and more precisely to the local density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "it is interesting to note that qian and vignale  @xcite recognized in their derivation of the spin - wave dynamics from td dft a dynamic term and a `` berry curvature '' correction , which we believe can be connected to the @xmath0-shift mentioned earlier  .",
    "we note that in the context of kondo impurities @xmath0-shifts were also predicted many years ago  @xcite , which was recently used to intrepret experimental data extracted with ists  @xcite . using first - order perturbation theory in the weak coupling regime of a spin to the surrounding electronic bath",
    ", the shift in @xmath0 was shown to be proportional to @xmath6 , where j describes an @xmath7@xmath8 type of interaction between a localized moment with the conduction electron and @xmath9 is the density of states of conduction electrons at the fermi energy .",
    "we stress that the latter is rather similar to our concept of renormalization of @xmath0 due to the electronic structure derived within td dft .",
    "the transverse dynamical magnetic susceptibility connecting the transverse magnetization to an infinitesimal transverse dynamical magnetic field is evaluated within td dft by solving the dyson - like equation : = [ dyson ] in a matrix notation .",
    "@xmath10 is the exchange and correlation kernel , which is assumed to be local in space and adiabatic .",
    "@xmath11 is the kohn - sham susceptibility whose imaginary part describes the density of stoner excitations and can be written as a convolution of green functions connecting the radial points @xmath12 and @xmath13 centered respectively around sites @xmath14 and @xmath15 : ^ij_0(,;)&=&-dz f(z ) [ g^_ij(,;z+ ) g^_ji(,;z ) + & & + g^_ij(,;z ) g^-_ji(,;z-)][chi0 ] , where @xmath16 is the fermi distribution function , @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the retarded and advanced one - particle green functions connecting atomic sites @xmath14 and @xmath15 and @xmath19 .",
    "the assessment of @xmath11 requires to compute green functions at energies @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "also usual contour deformations when calculating the integral are not possible since there is a convolution of green functions that are not analytical in the same complex half plane .",
    "we evaluated the kohn - sham susceptibility for several systems utilizing our recently developed method  @xcite based on the korringa - kohn - rostoker green function method  @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the green functions are projected on a chosen basis and the magnetic response to a spherically symmetric or site - dependent magnetic field is assumed . within this approach",
    "@xmath10 simplifies to a single number per magnetic atom . in this case",
    ", the quantity of interest is the spherical part of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath23 .    in figs .",

    ", the layer - resolved quantity is shown for the four last co surface layers . obviously , the imaginary and real parts of @xmath11 are rather linear with frequency .",
    "this linear regime defines the domain of applicability of the scheme proposed in this contribution , i.e. , it is limited to few tens of mev up to a couple of hundred mev depending on the investigated material .    in this linear regime , the transverse kohn - sham susceptibility can thus be written in a taylor expansion , _ 0 ( ) = _ 0(0 ) + ( s + s ) + ( ^2 ) , [ linear_chi0 ] where the slope @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a fermi - sea like term since it involves an energy integration up to the fermi energy of a convolution of green functions ( see eq .",
    "[ chi0 ] ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the slopes defining the linearity of @xmath11 can be determined from one single dft - based calculation .",
    "once @xmath11 is known , the full - susceptibility @xmath1 can be evaluated after solving a dyson - like equation ( eq .  [ dyson ] ) .    for simplification , we assume that the systems of interest are magnetically collinear . also , soc is set aside allowing to decouple the longitudinal excitations from the transverse ones .",
    "however , one can use an external magnetic field to mimic the energy gap induced by soc , which is of the order of the magnetic anisotropy energy .",
    "in other words , the magnetic field shifts the position of the resonances , thereby picking up electron - hole excitations that affect the corresponding lifetimes . in that case",
    "the gap is given by @xmath27 .",
    "both procedures lead to about the same lifetimes  @xcite within a tight - binding scheme  @xcite or using td dft including soc  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath28 and taking the limit of @xmath29 we find that @xmath30 in matrix notation . we know",
    "that @xmath31 . therefore for small @xmath2 ,    s^ij(, ) & = & .",

    "[ important1 ] is among the important results reported in this paper .",
    "it shows that extracting the linear behavior of the susceptibility requires an integral along a complex energy contour of a convolution of green functions that are analytical on the same complex half plane .",
    "therefore usual techniques used in regular methods based on green functions can be applied ( see e.g. ref .",
    "also the evaluation of @xmath32 is numerically straightforward and the integral over the energy is evaluated only once , thus the computational costs are dramatically reduced compared to those needed for the evaluation of eq .",
    "[ chi0 ] .",
    "we utilized eq .",
    "[ important1 ] to evaluate the kohn - sham susceptibilities for the cases mentioned earlier , for instance cr , mn , fe and co adatoms on cu(111 ) surface and co thin film on cu(001 ) surface .",

    ".  [ imag_chi0 ] is compelling and useful : the imaginary part of the change of @xmath11 at small frequencies is related to the density matrix for each spin channel at the fermi energy .",
    "@xmath37 can thus be considered as a fermi - surface - like term . if @xmath40 , i.e. , the susceptibility is local in space and depends on the product of energy - dependent charge density of opposite spin - character .",
    "this is the second important result of this work .",
    "the lifetime of the excitation and , thus , the damping can be calculated exactly after a one - shot calculation from a regular static dft run without even having to perform an energy integration .",
    "we propose to use this damping directly on top of the adiabatic approach usually utilized to extract the magnetic exchange interactions ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) and the related dispersion of spin - waves or the localized spin - excitations spectra ( e.g. refs .",
    "however , one has to keep in mind that stoner excitation will impact on the position of spin waves resonances via the real part of the kohn - sham susceptibility , which will be the topic of the next paragraph .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "[ imag_chi0 ] reduces to ^ij & = & -_ll_1 n^ij_ll_1(e_f ) n^ji_l_1l(e_f)[imag_chi0_simple ] if we use the framework presented in ref .",

    "[ imag_chi0 ] or  [ imag_chi0_simple ] have paramount physical implications : the way the minority or majority spin - levels intersect the fermi energy defines the damping of the excitations in terms of the product of density of states of opposite spin character .",
    "this explains for example that fe and co adatoms on several surfaces ( e.g. cu(001 ) , cu(111 ) and ag(111 ) surfaces ) have broad resonances in their excitation spectra since their minority - spin local density of states experiences a resonance close to the fermi energy contrary to mn and cr adatoms on the same surfaces , which have much sharper resonances because the fermi level lies between the majority and minority states  @xcite .",
    "considering that scanning tunneling microscopy can be used to map the spin - polarized local density of states at the fermi energy , an experimental estimate of the damping can be provided via eq .",
