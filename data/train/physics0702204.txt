    "the results of katriel _",
    "et al._@xcite show that higher - order functionals such as pbe@xcite and tpss@xcite can reasonably fix the lda problems in the case of the he isoelectronic series , but are much less satisfactory for the hooke s atom sequence , yielding a wrong scaling in the @xmath23 limit ( pbe ) or a correct scaling with an error of about 40% on the asymptotic value of the correlation energy ( tpss ) . as stressed by katriel _",
    "et al._@xcite , these differences in performances for the two series raise serious doubts on the universality of currently available correlation energy functionals .",
    "the accuracy of the results obtained via the apdft approach for both series suggests that the effort towards its generalization to many - electron systems of nonuniform density could be really worthwhile .",
