    "in recent years studying the structure , function and evolution of complex networks in society and nature has become a major research focus  @xcite . examples of complex networks include the internet , the world wide web , the international aviation network , social collaborations between a group of people , protein interactions in a cell , to name just a few .",
    "these networks exhibit a number of interesting properties , such as short average distance between a pair of nodes in comparison with large network size  @xcite , the clustering structure where one s friends are friends of each other , and the power law distribution of the number of connections a node has  @xcite .",
    "this paper concerns one particular type of complex networks , the document networks , such as the web and the citation networks .",
    "document networks are characteristic in that a document node , e.g.  a webpage or an article , carries text or multimedia content . properties of document networks are not only affected by topological connectivity between nodes , but also strongly influenced by semantic relation between the content of nodes",
    ". research on document networks is relevant to a number of issues , such as the web navigation and information retrieval  @xcite .",
    "menczer  @xcite reported that the probability of linkage between two documents increases with the similarity between their content .",
    "based on this observation , he proposed the degree - similarity mixture ( dsm ) model , which successfully reproduces two important properties of document networks : the power - law connectivity distribution and the increasing linkage probability as a function of content similarity .",
    "the dsm model remains one of the most advanced models for document networks .",
    "recently we reported that document networks exhibit a number of triangular clustering properties , for example they have huge numbers of triangles and high clustering coefficients , and there is a positive relation between the probability of formation of a triangle and the content similarity among the three documents involved  @xcite .",
    "menczer s dsm model focuses on the connectivity and content properties between two nodes , and it produces only around 5% of triangles in real document networks .",
    "there are a number of topology models which can produce networks with a power - law distribution of connectivity with high clustering coefficient , such as a network model in  @xcite which is based on the balance between different types of attachment mechanisms , i.e.  cyclic closure and focal closure .",
    "this model , however , do not has the ingredient of document content in its generative mechanisms and can not reproduce content - related properties of document networks .    in this paper , we examine and model the triangular clustering properties of document networks . in section  [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we firstly introduce two datasets of real document networks , we then define a number of metrics to quantify connectivity and content properties , and finally we review menczer s dsm model . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    "we propose our degree - similarity product ( dsp ) model , where a node s ability of acquiring a new link is given as a _ product _",
    "function of node connectivity and content similarity between nodes . in section  [ sec:4 ]",
    "we evaluate our dsp model against the real data and show that the model reproduces not only the connectivity and content properties between two nodes , but also the triangular clustering properties involving three nodes . in section  [ sec:5 ]",
    "we conclude the paper .",

    "we study ten randomly sampled subsets of the wt10 g data .",

    "it contains @xmath14 articles published by the proceedings of the national academy of sciences ( pnas ) of the united states of america from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "we crawled the data at the journal s website ( http://www.pnas.org ) in may 2008 and used each article s title and abstract as its content .",
    "triangle is the basic unit for clustering structure and network redundancy  @xcite .",
    "triangle - related properties have been used to quantify network transitivity  @xcite and characterise the structural invariance across web sites  @xcite .",
    "the most widely studied triangle - related property is the clustering coefficient , @xmath17 , which measures how tightly a node s neighbours are interconnected with each other  @xcite .",
    "clustering coefficient is calculated as the ratio of the number of triangles formed by a node and its neighbours to the maximal number of triangles they can have .",
    "when @xmath18 a node and its neighbours are fully interconnected and form a clique ; and when @xmath19 the neighbours do not know each other at all .",
    "the average clustering coefficient over all nodes measures the level of clustering behaviour in a network .",
    "note that triangle and clustering coefficient are not trivially related .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : modelevaluation ] , the total number of triangles , @xmath3 , in the wt10 g data is almost 100 times of that in the pnas data .",
    "the density of triangles in the wt10 g data , measured by @xmath20 or @xmath21 , is also many times larger .",

    "the content of a document is then represented as a keyword vector , @xmath27 , which gives the frequency of each keyword s appearance in the document .",
    "the content similarity , or relevance , @xmath24 , between two documents , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , is quantified by the cosine of their vectors : @xmath30 when @xmath31 the content of the two documents are highly related or similar ; when @xmath32 the two documents have very little in common .",
    "the linkage probability , @xmath23 , is the probability that two nodes with content similarity @xmath24 are connected in the network .",
    "it is calculated as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the total number of node pairs ( connected or not ) whose content similarity is @xmath24 , and @xmath35 is the number of such node pairs which are actually connected in the network .    figure  [ fig : dsm](a ) shows that in document networks the linkage probability increases with the content similarity , i.e.  the more similar the more likely two documents are connected .",
    "for example in the pnas citation network , if two articles have @xmath36 there is a 50% chance that they have a citation relation , by comparison the chance is very low when @xmath37 .      in document networks , if a node is similar to a second node and this second node is similar to a third node , then the first and third nodes are also similar . here",
    "we define a new metric called the _ trilateral similarity _ , @xmath26 , which measures the minimum content similarly among three nodes . for three document nodes",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath38 , the trilateral similarity is the smallest ( bilateral ) content similarity between each pair of the three nodes , i.e. @xmath39 similarly we define the triangularity probability , @xmath25 , as the probability that three nodes with the trilateral similarity @xmath26 form a triangle . in this study",
    "we consider weak triangles , each of which is a circle of three nodes with at least one link ( at any direction ) between each pair of the three nodes .",
    "figure  [ fig : dsm](b ) shows that the triangularity probability is sensitive to the trilateral similarity .",
    "when the trilateral similarity @xmath26 increases from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , the triangularity probability increases two orders of magnitude for the wt10 g data and four orders of magnitude for the pnas data , respectively .",
    "we note that for a given value of content similarity or trilateral similarity , the cube of the ( bilateral ) linkage probability provides the lower bound of the triangularity probability .",
    "but these two quantities are not trivially related because the later is strongly determined by a network s triangular clustering structure .",
    "the degree - similarity mixture ( dsm ) model was introduced by menczer in 2004  @xcite .",
    "the model s generative mechanism incorporates content similarity in the formation of document links . at each step ,",
    "one new document is added and attached by @xmath42 new links to existing documents . at time",
    "step @xmath43 , the probability that the new document @xmath43 is attached to the existing document @xmath28 is    @xmath44    where @xmath45 ; @xmath46 is the number of connections , or degree , of node @xmath28 ; @xmath24 is calculated from document content of the given network ; @xmath47 is a constant which is calculated based on real data ; and @xmath48 is a preferential attachment parameter .",
    "the first term of equation  ( [ eq : dsm ] ) favours an old node which is already well connected and the second term favours one whose content is similar to the new node .",
    "the tunable parameter @xmath49 models the balance between choosing a popular node with large degree or choosing a similar node with high content similarity .",

    "menczer has shown that the dsm model is able to reproduce the degree distribution of document networks .",
    "figure  [ fig : dsm](a ) shows the dsm model also produces a sound prediction on the relation between linkage probability and content similarity .    in terms of triangular clustering properties ,",
    "table  [ tab : modelevaluation ] shows that the model , however , produces only around @xmath54 of the total number of triangles contained in the real networks and underestimates the average clustering coefficient of the networks .",
    "figure  [ fig : dsm](b ) shows the model also significantly underestimates the correlation between triangularity probability and trilateral similarity .",
    "in this paper we introduce a new generative model for document networks , we call it the degree - similarity product ( dsp ) model . our model is partially inspired by the multi - component graph growing models of  @xcite .",
    "the model starts from an initial seed of a pair of linked nodes . at each time step ,",
    "one of the following two actions is taken :    * growth : with probability @xmath55 , a new isolated node is introduced to the network .",
    "parameter @xmath55 is a constant , which is given by the numbers of nodes and links of the generated network , @xmath56 , and determines the average node degree of the generated network , i.e.@xmath57 .",
    "* dsp preferential attachment : with probability @xmath58 , a new link is attached between two nodes .",
    "the link starts from node @xmath28 and ends at node @xmath29 .",
    "the two nodes are chosen by the following preferential probabilities : @xmath59 @xmath60 } , \\label{eq : target node}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the out - degree of node @xmath28 , @xmath62 is the in - degree of node @xmath29 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 run over all existing nodes , @xmath65 .",
    "the content similarity @xmath66 is calculated from document content of the given network .",
    "parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath48 and @xmath53 all take positive values .",
    "@xmath50 and @xmath51 give nodes with @xmath67 or @xmath68 , respectively , an initial ability of acquiring links .",
    "@xmath48 allows that even very different documents ( with @xmath69 ) still have a chance to link with each other .",
    "@xmath53 tunes the weight of the content similarity in choosing a link s ending node .",
    "it is notable that equation  [ eq : target node ] is a product function of degree and content similarity .",
    "this ensures that links are preferentially attached between nodes which are _ both _ popular _ and _ similar . as shown in the following section , this mechanism effectively increases the chance of forming triangles among similar nodes .",
    "for each of the two document networks , we generate ten networks using the dsp model with different random seeds .",
    "we avoid creating self - loops and duplicate links .",
    "the ten networks are grown to the same size as the target network .",
    "results are then averaged over the ten networks .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : modelevaluation ] , the dsp model well reproduces the number of triangles and the average clustering coefficient of the two document networks .",
    "figure  [ fig : dsp - twonodes ] and figure  [ fig : dsp - threenodes ] show that the model also closely resembles the two networks distribution of node in - degree , linkage probability as a function of content similarity , clustering coefficient as a function of node degree , and triangularity probability as a function of trilateral similarity . the average clustering coefficient of nodes with in - degree @xmath38 ( see figure  [ fig : dsp - threenodes](a ) and ( b ) ) gives details of a network s triangular clustering structure .",
    "table  [ tab : parameters ] gives the parameters used in the modelling .",
    "the value of the parameters are tuned for best fitting .",
    "our simulation shows that for both the real networks , the best modelling result is obtained when @xmath70 ( in equation  [ eq : orignal node ] ) and @xmath71 ( in equation  [ eq : target node ] ) take different values .",
    "this suggests that node out - degree and in - degree have different weights in choosing the starting and ending nodes of a link .",
    "the values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 for modelling the wt10 g data are smaller than those for the pnas data .",
    "this suggests that a poorly linked webpage has less difficulty in acquiring a new link in comparison with a poorly cited article",
    ". a larger value of @xmath53 is used for the pnas data .",
    "this indicates that content similarity plays a relatively stronger role than node connectivity in the growth of the citation network .",
    "it is known that document networks show a power - law degree distribution and a positive relation between the linkage probability and content similarity . in this paper , we show that document networks also contain very large numbers of triangles , high values of clustering coefficient , and a strong correlation between the triangularity probability and trilateral similarity .",
    "these three properties are not captured by the previous dsm model where a new node tends to link with an old node which is either popular or similar .    our intuition is that a link tends to attach between two documents which are both popular and similar .",
    "we propose the degree - similarity product ( dsp ) model which resembles this behaviour by using the preferential attachment based on a product function of node connectivity and content similarity .",
    "our model reproduces all the above topological and content properties with remarkable accuracy .",
    "our work provides a new insight into the structure and evolution of document networks and has the potential to facilitate the research on new applications and algorithms on document networks .",
    "future work will mathematically analyse the dsp model , examine different types of triangles in document networks , and investigate the possible relation between the triangular clustering and the formation of communities in document networks .",
