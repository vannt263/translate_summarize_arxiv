    "in this paper we are concerned with _ perfect forms _ , which are _ real positive definite quadratic forms _ @xmath4 = \\sum_{i , j=1}^d q_{ij } x_i x_j\\ ] ] in @xmath0 variables @xmath5 , determined uniquely by their _",

    "they observed that perfection is necessary for positive definite quadratic forms in order to give a local maximum of the _ hermite invariant _",
    "@xmath8 such forms are called _",
    "extreme_.    as briefly reviewed in section  [ sec : quadforms ] , finding the global maximum of the hermite invariant , or equivalently the densest lattice sphere packing is a widely studied problem . in this article",
    "we describe the only known algorithmic solution of this problem which works in principle in every dimension .",
    "it is based on the classification respectively enumeration of perfect forms .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for further reading .    based on perfect forms , voronoi @xcite developed a polyhedral reduction theory , which was later found to have several applications in other contexts .",
    "it has for example been used for compactification of moduli spaces ( cf .",
    "for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , for computing the cohomology of @xmath9 and of congruence subgroups , as well as for computing algebraic @xmath10-groups @xmath11 for small @xmath0 and up to small torsion ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and the appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "a basic task in these computations is the enumeration of perfect forms . in some of the applications it is also necessary to understand more of the structure of the _ ryshkov polyhedron _ ( to be defined in section  [ sec : ryshkov ] ) whose vertices are perfect forms .    in this article",
    "we explain voronoi s theory based on the ryshkov polyhedron .",
    "we provide complete proofs for all of its required properties .",
    "we think that this view is more accessible than the usual dual viewpoint , originally taken by voronoi and by most other authors subsequently .",
    "voronoi s algorithm can be simply described as a traversal search on the graph consisting of vertices and edges of the ryshkov polyhedron .",
    "this viewpoint allows in particular a very simple and direct generalization to so called @xmath1-perfect forms : intersecting a linear subspace @xmath1 with the ryshkov polyhedron yields a lower dimensional ryshkov polyhedron whose vertices are @xmath1-perfect forms .",
    "voronoi s theory immediately generalizes .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : quadforms ] we review some necessary background and notations . in section",
    "[ sec : ryshkov ] we define the ryshkov polyhedron and prove that it is `` locally finite '' .",
    "this yields the grounds for voronoi s algorithm to be described in section  [ sec : voronoi ] .",
    "here we put special emphasis on practical issues related to running voronoi s algorithm on a computer . in section  [ sec : extremality ] we briefly explain how to determine extreme forms .",
    "section  [ sec : symmetries ] contains some informations on automorphism groups and their computation and in section  [ sec : tperfect ] we explain the `` @xmath1-theory '' , when restricting to a linear subspace  @xmath1 . as examples of linear subspaces that contain forms invariant with respect to a finite group of automorphisms , we consider in section  [ sec : examples ] forms with a _ gaussian _ , _ eisenstein _ or _ hurwitz quaternionic _ structure .",
    "we obtain several new classification results .",
    "in this section we review  basically from scratch  some of the historical background and notations used in the remaining of the article .",
    "the reader familiar with most of this background may simply skip this section .",
    "we consider real quadratic forms in @xmath0 variables as in , hence with coefficients @xmath12 . by assuming @xmath13 without loss of generality",
    ", we simply identify the quadratic form @xmath14 with the real symmetric matrix @xmath15 .",
    "the space of all real quadratic forms in @xmath0 variables is identified with the space [ not : sd ] @xmath16 of real symmetric @xmath17 matrices . using matrix notation we have @xmath18 = { x}^t q { x}$ ] .",
    "endowed with the inner product @xmath19 @xmath20 becomes a @xmath21-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "two quadratic forms @xmath22 are called _ arithmetically ( or integrally ) equivalent _ , if there exists a matrix @xmath23 in the group @xmath24 such that @xmath25 note that @xmath26= q'[{\\mathbb z}^d]$ ] for arithmetical equivalent @xmath14 and @xmath27 , but the opposite may not hold .",

    "the set of all positive definite quadratic forms ( pqfs from now on ) is denoted by @xmath30 .",
