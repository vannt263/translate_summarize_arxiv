    "new once - subtracted dispersion relations with the imposed crossing symmetry condition for the @xmath0-@xmath10 wave @xmath1 amplitudes have recently been derived and presented in the refs . @xcite .",
    "further analysis of these equations in the ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath0 and @xmath4 waves ( the so - called gkpy equations ) led inter alia to very precise determination of the position of the pole related with the @xmath7 resonance ( hereafter @xmath9 ) .",
    "importance and effectiveness of similar dispersion relations but with two subtractions , i.e. of the so - called roy equations @xcite , were already presented on the example of the elimination of long standing up - down ambiguity in the @xmath1 @xmath0 wave amplitude below 1  gev @xcite and of determination of the quark condensate constants @xcite .",
    "quite recently the roy s equations were once again effectively exploited in searching for unique determination of the @xmath0 and @xmath4 wave @xmath1 scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "due to incorporation of two boundary conditions for these amplitudes , it was possible to find such analytical solution below 800  mev in accordance with derived and proven theorem on the uniqueness of such solutions  @xcite .",
    "one of the byproduct of these analyses and those with gkpy equations @xcite was official and long - awaited significant modification of the position of the @xmath9 pole in particle data tables . for many years",
    "this state was appearing with mass and width noticeably larger than 500  mev .",
    "for example in the particle data tables in 2010  @xcite the mass was in the range @xmath11 4001200  mev and the full width @xmath12 6001000  mev . before year 1994",
    "the @xmath9 meson was even excluded from the tables for about 20 years . since 2012",
    "its parameters are much better determined , i.e. , @xmath11 400550  mev and @xmath12 400700  mev  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this many years of confusion and uncertainty about these parameters was that their determination was based mostly on fairly disparate and uncertain experimental results .",
    "fortunately , well - grounded theoretical works based on dispersion relations with the imposed crossing symmetry condition , presented , e.g. in @xcite , provided very strong arguments to resolve the existing uncertainties .    despite of those big and widely accepted changes in parameters of the @xmath9 meson many analyses can still use the old , i.e. significantly too wide and too massive , scalar - isoscalar state below 1  gev .",
    "the reason for this may be difficulties in changing parameters of some models or parametrizations to adapt them to the new requirements .",
    "use of the correct and precise parametrizations of the @xmath1 amplitudes is , however , sometimes crucial especially when high precision of the final results is required",
    ". this can be particularly well seen , for example , in analyses of the @xmath1 final state interactions in the heavy mesons decays ( e.g. @xmath13 or @xmath14 where @xmath15 is @xmath16 or @xmath17 ) needed to determine parameters of a very small cp violation .",
    "another kind of analyses which need correct and very precise @xmath1 amplitudes are those which pretend to describe spectrum of light mesons decaying into @xmath1 pairs in given partial waves and which strongly require verification of compliance with the crossing symmetry condition .",
    "one of them is the multichannel ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 ) analysis of the @xmath1 scattering data presented in @xcite which uses unitary amplitudes up to 1.8  gev with proper analytical properties on the whole riemann surface .",
    "however , in the construction of these amplitudes the crossing symmetry condition was not required what resulted in insufficiently precise description of the @xmath1 elastic region . moreover",
    ", these amplitudes did not describe correctly the experimental data in the vicinity of the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "the aim of this work is to present a general method of refining the @xmath1 amplitudes by fitting them to the gkpy equations while maintaining their original mathematical structure .",
    "the method alters only numerical values of some of parameters ( e.g. positions of the resonances and the background ) .",
    "the refined amplitudes must be self - consistent , i.e. still unitary and , what is new , fulfilling the crossing symmetry condition below 1.1  gev .",
    "the method is demonstrated on a refining of the multichannel @xmath0 and @xmath4 wave amplitudes from @xcite .",
    "the insufficiency of these amplitudes to describe the near threshold phase shifts complicates slightly the refining since a new prescription of the near threshold amplitudes has to be added .",
    "this makes , however , the presented method more general and enhances a chance to convince potential readers , who might want to perform similar refining of their amplitudes , on effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed method .",
    "quantitative changes in the refined amplitudes will be presented inter alia by the difference between the positions of the @xmath9 poles before and after fitting .    in sec .",
    "ii we recall the method used in the multichannel analysis @xcite and its main results . in sec .",
    "iii we present the dispersion relations with the imposed crossing symmetry condition and methodology used in dispersive analyses of the data  @xcite . in sec .",

    "the transformation into the uniformizing plane can be fully done if and only if less than three - channels are considered . in the three - channel case",

    "after these modifications the amplitudes fulfill this symmetry from the @xmath1 threshold to around 1.1  gev and describe very well experimental data below about 1.8  gev in all considered channels , e.g. , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath140 . in the case of the amplitudes considered here , apart of finding new values of some of their parameters ,",
    "the only important modification was introduction of the new part describing the near threshold region .",
    "the most important consequence of the fit to the dispersion relations was a significant movement of the @xmath9 pole by several hundred mev , i.e. by values comparable with its final mass and width .",
    "the new @xmath9-pole position agrees very well with the value accepted in the particle data tables in 2012 @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes , refitted using the presented method , can now be used as representative for the modeling of the @xmath1 interactions what was impossible for the original ones with significantly too massive and too wide @xmath9 meson .",
    "another interesting result of refitting the multichannel amplitudes is a marked change of positions of the @xmath54 poles which are located well above the inelastic threshold . on the contrary imposing the crossing symmetry constraint",
    "practically did not affect the parameters of @xmath141 .",
