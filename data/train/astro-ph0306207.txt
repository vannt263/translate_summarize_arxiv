    "is restricted , at all masses : in order to have values of @xmath25 which fall in the cosmologically relevant range , the annihilation cross section integrated from freeze  out down to the present time must be inside the interval @xmath91 .",

    "temperature @xmath16 is large ; on the contrary , when @xmath16 is small , temperature corrections in the early universe induce @xmath92 to deviate , also sizeably , from @xmath16 .",
    "this difference in the two cross sections is responsible for the band of values of @xmath38 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssm_y_mchi]a .",
    "when the neutralino relic abundance is low , such that neutralinos are not the dominant component of dark matter , @xmath38 acquires an additional dependence on @xmath25 through the rescaling factor @xmath94 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mssm_y_mchi]b .",

    "this implies that largely subdominant relic neutralinos are likely to provide ( almost ) undetectable antiproton fluxes .",
    "this is somewhat at variance with the case of direct detection : the difference arises from the fact that the antiproton signal ( as well as the other galactic signals ) depends quadratically on the dark matter density ( and henceforth on the rescaling factor ) while for direct detection the dependence is linear and the suppression is much milder @xcite .",
    "the situation of msugra is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sugra_y_mchi ] . in this case ,",
    "the largest values of the flux factor @xmath38 are about an order of magnitude lower that in the emssm : @xmath96 gev@xmath88 for light neutralinos .",
    "this is a consequence of the properties of neutralinos in this constrained type of models : neutralinos turn out to be mainly gauginos and their couplings , especially to higgs bosons which require a mixed higgsino ",

    "let us move now to the discussion of differential spectra of antiprotons which are produced by neutralino annihilation .",
    "the capability of producing antiprotons depends on the possibility for neutralinos to produce quarks or gluons , either directly or through decay of their annihilation products : quarks and gluons will then hadronize and eventually produce antiprotons .",

    "the neutralino annihilation is calculated analytically as described in ref .",
    "neutralino annihilation occurs at rest in the galactic frame , and the different final states which are open depend therefore on the neutralino mass .",
    "the annihilation may proceed through the following channels : production of a fermion pair ; production of @xmath99 and @xmath100 ; production of a higgs pair ; production of a higgs together with a gauge boson ( which can be the @xmath101 boson or the @xmath102 depending whether the higgs is neutral or charged ) .",

    "@xcite , and also compared with different propagation models ( such as galprop ) .",
    "this point is of great importance for the present work , as the theoretical uncertainties in the antiproton flux are underestimated if some parameters are not varied over all their plausible values .",

    "the fluxes we have shown so far , all refer to a dark matter density distribution in the form of an cored isothermal sphere .",

    "we can parameterize the enhancement of the matter density by a multiplicative factor @xmath250 , which then enters as @xmath251 in the calculation of the antiproton primary flux , since the flux depends on the square of the matter density .",

    "[ fig : prim_sec_data_med_solmin ] : the phase space cut off at @xmath221 implies that light neutralino would need a huge overdensity factor in order to match the observed antiproton flux at @xmath232 gev , but this would produce an exceedingly large flux at @xmath230 gev . on the contrary , heavy neutralinos have a phase space cut off at much higher kinetic energies , and therefore a mild overdensity may enhance the flux at @xmath232 gev without giving conflict at low kinetic energies .",
    "we have calculated the flux of antiprotons produced by relic neutralino annihilations in the galactic halo in a detailed diffusion model constrained by analysis of stable and radioactive nuclei .",
    "the source of antiprotons is studied both in a low  energy minimal supersymmetric standard model ( emssm ) and in a supergravity inspired supersymmetric scheme ( msugra ) .",
    "we find that the interstellar primary antiproton fluxes are affected by a large uncertainty , which spans two orders of magnitude at low antiproton kinetic energies .",
    "this is at variance with the secondary antiproton fluxes ( whose uncertainty never exceeds 24% @xcite ) and it is mainly related to the fact that the source of the primary flux is located inside the diffusive halo , whose size is unknown . by adopting a conservative choice for the dark matter density  profile and propagation parameters ,",
    "no supersymmetric configuration can be excluded on the basis of an excess over the existing data . actually , the data are quite well explained by the secondary contribution alone . however , if we adopt the best values for the propagation parameters ( corresponding to a thickness of the diffusive halo of 4 kpc ) , a window of low ",
    "mass neutralino configurations provides fluxes which , once summed up to the secondary contribution , are in excess of the experimental measurements .",
    "we have shown that the sensitivity to the antiproton signal is increased with the halo size and limited by strong convection .",
    "an improved knowledge of the propagation parameters will certainly help in reducing the uncertainty on the primary flux and consequently it could allow us to set more severe constraints on the supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "the sensititity of the primary antiproton flux on the shape of the dark matter density profile has also been investigated .",
    "we have shown that the shape of the dark matter density distribution does not introduce large uncertainties .",
    "in particular , we have demonstrated that a nfw distribution can increase the primary antiproton flux by no more than 20% with respect to the isothermal profile .",
    "indeed , it is very improbable to detect at earth antiprotons produced in the centeral regions of the galaxy , where the two distributions differ most .    in the next years several balloon - borne experiments such as bess ,",
    "space  based detectors such as ams and satellites as pamela will provide very abundant and accurate data on the antiproton flux . at the same time , new data on cosmic ray nuclei are expected and would lead to a better knowledge of the cosmic  ray propagation mechanisms .",
    "we could thus expect a dramatic reduction of the uncertainties affecting the neutralino - induced antiproton flux and much more definite predictions for antiprotons of supersymmetric origin will then be possible .",
    "many efforts are also devoted to other indirect neutralino searches , such as positrons and antideuterons in cosmic rays , gamma rays and up - going muons , as well as to direct searches in deep underground laboratories , giving thus the hope that more constraining analysis on the existence of relic neutralinos in the halo of our galaxy will be viable .",
    "the antiproton differential spectrum per annihilation event @xmath255 ) is calculated by following analytically the decay chain of the neutralino annihilation products until a quark or a gluon @xmath256 is produced .",
    "the antiproton spectrum is then obtained by a monte carlo modelling of the quark and gluon hadronization ( we make use of the pythia package @xcite ) .",
    "we have produced the @xmath103 differential distributions for @xmath257 at various injection energies for each @xmath256 ( the @xmath258 quark is assumed to decay before hadronization and is treated analytically , since in addition to its standard model decay into @xmath259 , it may have a supersymmetric decay into @xmath260 ) .",
    "whenever we need the @xmath103 distribution for an injection energy different from the produced ones , we perform an interpolation . in order to obtain the antiproton differential distribution in the neutralino rest frame we perform the necessary boosts on the mc spectra .",
