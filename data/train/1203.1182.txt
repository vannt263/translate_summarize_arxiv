    "planets are not the only bodies orbiting their host stars : solid bodies from microscopic dust to sub - terrestrial planet size objects such as pluto also form during planet assembly both in the solar system and around other nearby stars .",

    "the next logical step in our picture is the disruption of the parent gas clump , as required by the td hypothesis .",

    "we show that there are two possible ways of the host clump disruption  either tidally or due to an internal energy release by the growing protoplanetary core itself .",

    "we find that bodies smaller than @xmath0 1  cm and larger than @xmath1  km stand a good chance of remaining `` independent '' after the clump disruption compared with the bodies between these size limits : these suffer strong drag from the gas and must end up joining the protoplanetary core in the centre of the gas clump . in ",
    "[ sec : theory ] we consider analytically the kind of orbits that the large solid bodies obtain after the gas clump disruption .",

    "several following sections present the numerical results , with ",
    "[ sec : gas ] showing the gas flow , ",
    " [ sec : unbound ] and [ sec : bound_orbits ] focusing on the population of unbound and bound solid bodies , respectively . ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] contains a discussion of the main results of our paper .",
    "for definitiveness , we consider a host gas clump of @xmath7 mass in the numerical part of the paper .",
    "we assume that the initial density and temperature profiles are that of a polytropic sphere with the polytropic index @xmath8 as appropriate for a molecular hydrogen - dominated gas in the temperature range from a few hundred k to about 1500 k @xcite .",
    "the clump is initially located at @xmath9 au on a circular orbit around the star of mass @xmath10 .",
    "we shall refer to the host gas clump as such to distinguish it from the solid planetary core , which we frequently call `` planet '' .",
    "the planet ( of mass @xmath11 ) is treated as a point mass in this paper .",
    "we assume that the density of the planet is much higher than that of the host clump .",
    "therefore , the internal structure of the planet is not affected by the host gas clump disruption .",
    "we note that this setting does not require the planet to consist of high - z material only ; volatiles could be present also as long as their densities are much higher than the tidal density , @xmath12 .",
    "we study two limiting cases of clump disruption . in the case of disruption due to",
    "tidal forces from the star , the host clump fills its roche lobe at the start of the simulation , time @xmath13 .",
    "the size of the roche lobe ( hill s radius ) at this location is @xmath14 a polytropic cloud with the clump mass @xmath7 and the clump radius , @xmath15 , satisfying @xmath16 has central temperature @xmath17 k , for reference .",
    "the mass - radius relation of a polytropic cloud is given by @xmath18 this implies that the host clump expands rapidly as mass is lost .",
    "we therefore expect a prompt tidal disruption of such a host clump by roche lobe overflow : @xmath15 increases while @xmath19 decreases as @xmath20 drops .",
    "we shall add to this that the stabilising effect of the host clump outward migration due to the mass exchange between the gas clump and the star , discovered by @xcite , does not occur in our simulations because the clump is destroyed rather rapidly in all of the simulations below .",
    "in addition , we find that disruption proceeds via both l1 and l2 points , in contrast to what is found for much more gentle `` hot disruptions '' at @xmath21 au separations by @xcite . for both of these reasons there is no outward torque on the host clump ; the tidal disruption has a runaway character .      in the second class of models we consider here ,",
    "the clump s initial radius is smaller than the hill s radius @xmath19 . in particular , for the two simulations presented below , we set the initial central temperature to @xmath22 k , which corresponds to the clump s initial radius of @xmath23 au .",
    "we then assume that a sudden burst of energy release occurs in the centre of the clump .",
    "physically , we relate the burst to the assembly of the planetary core , as is found in 1d simulations of @xcite . in detail , the energy released by the solid core is passed to the surrounding gas by radiative diffusion .",
    "if the radiative diffusion time scale is longer than the planetary core s assembly time and the injection energy is large enough then even an isolated gas clump may be disrupted .",
    "an example of this is simulation m0@xmath243 , figures 5 to 7 in @xcite .",
    "we estimate the energy released by the planetary core to be about its binding energy , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath27 is the solid core density in g @xmath28 .",
    "let us now compare the core s binding energy with the minimum amount of energy needed to disrupt the host clump .",
    "the total energy of a polytropic gas clump , @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30 for simplicity we assume that the clump remains polytropic after the energy injection ( which is not obvious at all ; we will come back to this later ) with same @xmath31 but a different adiabatic constant .",
    "the energy input sufficient to disrupt the clump , @xmath32 is the energy needed to inflate the clump to the point of its tidal disruption , i.e. , when @xmath15 increases and becomes equal to the hill s radius , @xmath19 .",
    "thus , @xmath33 for reference , @xmath34erg for clump mass @xmath7 and clump radius @xmath35 au .    as energy released by the core heats the surrounding gas , it is instructive to compare the required energy injection @xmath32 with the initial total internal energy of the host clump , @xmath36 : @xmath37 in the limit of the initially small host clump , @xmath38 , the disruption energy is @xmath39 for @xmath8 . in the case under consideration ,",
    "@xmath35 au , and @xmath40 au , and thus @xmath41 .    from the following",
    "we conclude that the energy required to unbind the host gas clump is of the order of @xmath42 erg .",
    "this is of the same order as the binding energy of the planetary core of mass @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , we see that , to disrupt the host clump with the energy released by the planetary core , the mass of the core must be at least @xmath44 .",
    "we also note in passing that the similarity of this mass to the critical solid core mass in the ca theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) seems to be a pure coincidence . while the minimum mass capable of disrupting the gas host clump is the function of the conditions in that clump ( mass , age , opacity , etc . ) , the ca critical mass is a function of the core s surroundings  the location from the star , opacity and the planetesimal accretion rate from the surrounding protoplanetary disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite finds that when grains contained in the host clump grow by the hit - and - stick mechanism to sizes of the order of @xmath45 cm , their sedimentation within @xmath46 years becomes possible ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "accumulation of these to the centre of the clump creates a region dominated by grains rather than by gas .",
    "this region , called `` grain cluster '' by @xcite then becomes gravitationally unstable and collapses to form a massive core composed of high - z materials .    as argued in ",
    "[ sec : debris_intro ] , due to rotation and chaotic convective gas motions in the centre of the host clump , one may expect numerous smaller bodies to form in the centre of the clump as well .",
    "it is the fate of these bodies that interests us here .",
    "we shall now consider what happens to solids of different sizes , @xmath47 , from microscopic grains to asteroid - sized bodies , if they are placed within the host clump .",
    "as we shall see , due to the aerodynamic drag that these solids suffer , small grains ( @xmath48 cm ) are nearly frozen in with the gas , so have to follow its motion , whereas bodies larger than @xmath49 km experience negligible friction with the gas .",
    "bodies in the intermediate size range are most likely to end up joining the solid core .",
    "the smaller and the larger objects may survive the gas clump disruption and become either planet satellites or independent bodies in heliocentric orbits .    to quantify this discussion , we model the host gas clump in this section only as in the analytical model of @xcite , which shows that the outer radius of the host clump is approximately independent of the clump s mass , @xmath50  au  @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the host clump s age , and @xmath53 is dimensionless opacity ( cf .",
    " 2.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the age of the host clump chosen for the representative calculation below is @xmath54 years , the mass is @xmath55 , and opacity @xmath56 .",
    "note that in detail the structure of the host clump is different from that of the gas clumps we consider in the numerical of the paper , but the main conclusions that we reach in this section are qualitatively unaffected by this .    for simplicity ,",
    "clump rotation is neglected in this section , but we note that results for rotating gas clumps are actually quite similar as long as gas pressure is the main means of support against gravity for the host clump ( in the opposite case the gas clump would be unstable to various fluid instabilities ; see , e.g. , chapter 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "our goal here is to calculate how long it takes for a grain of size @xmath47 and a given initial condition for the grain position and velocity to settle to the centre of the clump due to aerodynamic friction with the gas . to achieve this goal ,",
    "we solve for the grain s motion within the host clump using the formulae of @xcite for the aerodynamic forces acting on the grains .",
    "this allows us to calculate the radial sedimentation velocity of the grain , @xmath57 , and define the sedimentation time as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is distance to the clump s centre . for solids released from rest results of such calculations",
    "are presented in fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "here we present a very similar calculation for dust grains that are on initially circular orbits around the host gas clump s centre .",
    "figure [ fig : tsed ] shows the sedimentation time scale for grains released on circular orbits with initial radii @xmath59 of 0.02 , 0.1 and 0.5 times @xmath60 for the blue dot - dashed , brown dashed and black solid curves , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "the red dash - triple - dot curve shows the grain sedimentation time for a grain released from rest , as in @xcite .    without rotation ,",
    "grains larger than a few cm manage to sediment to the centre of the gas clump within its age .",
    "smaller grains are tightly bound to the gas , and if the host is disrupted , these grains are released into the disc around the protoplanet .",
    "the grains closest to the solid core could have been thermally reprocessed into crystalline materials ; mixing these with surrounding disc s ices and incorporating into comets may explain their puzzling compositions @xcite .    in a purely spherical geometry with no rotational support for grains , large grains ( @xmath61 m ) fall into the centre and",
    "join the solid core on the free - fall time , which for a constant density model clump is constant with radius ( cf . the horizontal part of the red dash - triple - dot curve ) .    for grains on circular orbits , however , centrifugal force balances gravity , and the grains sediment only because of a gradual angular momentum loss due to aerodynamic forces .",
    "these forces become progressively less important for larger grains , and therefore the grain sedimentation time increases with @xmath47 again ( cf . the black , the brown and the blue curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsed ] ) . as a result ,",
    "grains larger than 1 - 10 km may orbit the centre of the clump for times comparable with the clump s lifetime ( which we assume of the same order as the clump s age here , as presumably the clump continues to migrate inward at roughly same migration speed ) .    concluding , we see that solid objects larger than a few km in size do not necessarily contribute to growth of the solid planetary core as it may take too long for these bodies to spiral into the core : the host clump is likely to be disrupted before such an inspiral occurs .      in this paper",
    "we do not simulate the phase of planetesimal formation due to numerical challenges .",
    "previous simulations of the whole proto - planetary disc by @xcite lacked numerical resolution ( to resolve smaller objects ) and resulted in formation of single self - bound massive ( @xmath62 a few @xmath63 ) clusters of dust particles inside the gas clumps .",
    "these were held from a further self - gravitational collapse artificially by employing a finite gravitational softening length in the simulations .",
    "increasing numerical resolution further ( that is , the number of sph and dust particles ) by up to several orders of magnitude is needed to resolve small , e.g. , @xmath64 au scales , on which planetesimals we are interested here could form .",
    "this is beyond our present numerical capabilities .",
    "figure [ fig : tsed ] shows a difficulty for formation of planetesimals in the td scheme , very much similar in nature to the well known `` metre - size barrier '' for the planetesimal growth in the protoplanetary discs @xcite . in the ca theory , aerodynamic coupling with the gas makes @xmath0  metre - sized boulders migrate radially inward in the disc , so that they are probably lost to the protostar before they become planetesimals .    similarly ,",
    "figure [ fig : tsed ] shows that solids of intermediate sizes migrate radially inward very rapidly even if they are initially set on circular orbits around the centre of the host gas clump .",
    "such objects thus must join the massive solid core there .",
    "to arrive at km - sized and larger bodies that suffer much weaker aerodynamic drag , smaller grains must thus somehow `` jump '' from being small to being large without suffering the aerodynamic drag .",
    "we leave a detailed study of this issue to a future paper , but make some suggestions on how this difficulty may be avoided .",
    "first of all , again reminiscent of the well known ideas in the ca theory context , channels for a rapid growth of solids may be available : via self - gravitational instability @xcite of dust - dominated regions ( although not in necessarily in the shape of a disc ) , or via turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "secondly , and unlike the ca `` metre - size barrier '' problem , here it is much less clear that aerodynamic drag does make all the medium - sized solids to accrete onto the central object . in the case of a proto - planetary disc ( the ca model ) ,",
    "the protostar contains almost all the mass and is thus the natural central ( nearly ) point - mass around which the disc rotates .",
    "grains migrating inward must therefore end up in the star . in the td case , however , the mass of the `` massive '' solid core we are thinking about is measured in earth masses , which is @xmath65 of the total host gas clump mass . if there are turbulent or convective motions in the inner region of the clump ( which is almost a certainty ) , then the solid core itself will be affected by the gas motions through its coupling to the gas via gravity of the latter .",
    "thus it may not `` sit '' in the centre of the clump accreting all the medium - sized solids sedimenting there .",
    "furthermore , motion of the grains would also be affected , with turbulent and convective motions of gas dragging the grains around .",
    "there is clearly a limit here ; too much of turbulence would prevent grains from sedimenting into the centre in the first place , but moderate turbulent motions may be expected to delay grain accretion onto the solid core and lead to formation of new condensation centres which perhaps would lead to formation of the larger planetesimals that we study in the rest of the paper",
    ".    it would also be desirable to understand just how large the planetesimals formed inside the host gas clump are likely to be .",
    "following  3.6.2 and 3.6.3 of @xcite , we find that the linear extent of the region of the gas cloud within which the first gravitational collapse of grain - dominated regions could occur is about @xmath66 times the size of the gas clump .",
    "for the total grain mass in the collapsing region of @xmath67 , the expected velocity dispersion of fragments formed by collapse is then @xmath68 km s@xmath69 .",
    "now , collisions of large planetesimals of equal size , @xmath70 , would lead to their fragmentation if the collision velocity ( @xmath0 the velocity dispersion calculated above ) is larger than the escape velocity from the surface of the planetesimal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this would then suggest that collisions of equal size bodies inside the `` grain sphere '' would split planetesimals smaller than about 1000 km , while larger bodies would `` stick '' .",
    "one however need to estimate the frequency of such collisions . assuming that the grain sphere fragments into bodies of approximately equal size , we find that all the planetesimals would have had at least one catastrophic ( shattering ) collision within a thousand years inside the grain sphere for @xmath71 km . collisions with smaller bodies  fragments of the `` original '' planetesimals ",
    "increase this collision rate estimate further .",
    "we thus conclude that expected sizes of planetesimals surviving the dense environment of the inner region of the clump are at least a few hundred km .",
    "presumably both smaller and larger solid objects could then be obtained over much longer time scales by collisional evolution of the disrupted population .",
    "having understood the range of body sizes ( @xmath61 km ) that may be considered as independent for the duration of the host clump , we now shift out attention to what may happen when the host clump is disrupted . in detail",
    "the answer on this question is quite complicated as it depends on the nature of planetesimal orbits within the clump and the exact way the clump is disrupted .",
    "however , for not too eccentric orbits , we can divide the planetesimal population on those that are `` close '' and those that are `` far '' from the solid planetary core .",
    "the former have a fair chance of remaining bound to the solid core when the host clump is disrupted , and the latter become unbound independent objects .    to quantify this , consider the simplest setting , placing a solid core of mass @xmath72 in the centre of the gas clump and setting planetesimals on circular orbits around the planet .",
    "the rotation of the planetesimal s disc is assumed prograde with respect to the orbit of the host clump around the star .",
    "the circular speed of the planetesimals around the planet is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the gas mass enclosed inside radius @xmath59 ( distance from the centre of the host clump ) .    if planet s mass is low enough to build up a massive self - gravitating atmosphere around it ( which is expected to be the case for an adiabatic young gas clump where the critical core mass is above 100 @xmath63 ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the gas density is nearly constant in the clump s centre .",
    "let us call that central density @xmath75 ; thus @xmath76 .",

    "we expect that when the host clump is disrupted , objects within @xmath77 remain bound to the solid planet whereas objects outside this radius become unbound from the planet .",
    "we now build an approximate analytical theory for the orbits of the planetesimals after the host clump tidal disruption . to this end",
    "we assume that gas clump disruption is instantaneous .",
    "we also assume that solids within @xmath77 remain bound to the planet and continue to follow its motion around the central star , and we concentrate here only on solids outside the influence radius .    before the disruption ,",
    "the position of a planetesimal with respect to the star is given by @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the vector connecting the star with the centre of the gas clump ( solid planet s location ) , and @xmath85 is the vector connecting the centre of the host clump with the given planetesimal .",
    "the instantaneous velocity of the planetesimal is also comprised of two parts , one due to the heliocentric keplerian motion of the gas clump , @xmath86 , and the other given by the circular prograde rotation velocity , @xmath87 , around the centre of the host clump .",
    "we now call @xmath88 the planetesimal s velocity right after the host clump disruption .",

    "we note one rather interesting feature of equation [ ecc_a ] : it does not depend on the properties of the host gas clump _ or _ the solid protoplanetary core inside .",

    "the properties of the host gas clump are still imprinted on the _ range _ of possible planetesimal orbits through the fact that the pre - disruption protoplanet is finite in spatial extent , and that the maximum velocity kick to a planetesimal released by the clump disruption , @xmath118 , is also finite . referring to equation [ a_linear ]",

    "the top panel of figure [ fig : eb015_orbit_live ] shows that planetesimals continue to have very small orbital inclinations after the disruption , with the mean inclination angle of only @xmath172 .",
    "this is natural since in our setup tidal disruption of the host gas protoplanet is symmetric around its orbital plane . in fact , the approximate analytical theory of  [ sec : explosion ] predicts that inclination of planetesimal orbits should remain exactly zero .",
    "therefore , the inclination found in the simulation must result either from a small but finite asymmetry with respect to @xmath173 inversion developing during the disruption , or due to effects not taken into account in the analytical theory .",
    "the central @xmath174 to @xmath175 au region of this plot shows a higher dispersion in the values of @xmath117 than do the more distant regions .",

    "we also note that gas from the disrupted host clump is initially arranged in a high density spiral , gravitational potential of which may well be significant enough to scatter planetesimals about and to pump their inclinations .",
    "this explanation is consistent with the fact that planetesimals on wider orbits , e.g. , @xmath176 au , which should be affected by the interactions with the gas spiral less , indeed have smaller dispersion in their inclination angles .",
    "the non - zero mean value of @xmath117 for this population , more distant from the planet , should be due to asymmetries developing during the disruption process .",
    "comparison with simulation u0 below , which produces far smaller inclinations , demonstrates that the asymmetries are probably related to the injection of energy in the centre of the host in u15 ( and u10 ) .",
    "this energy injection increases the entropy of the gas within @xmath177 around the planet but not at larger radii .",
    "the initial entropy profile is thus strongly unstable to convection in u10 and u15 , most likely leading to an asymmetric ( with respect to the initial orbital plane of the clump ) expansion of the host clump .",

    "the green dots show the simplest one  equation [ ecc_a ] .",

    "we also assume that the kick velocity of the planetesimals after the disruption , @xmath89 is equal to @xmath182 , where @xmath183 and @xmath184 is the circular velocity of the planetesimal before the disruption ( cf .",

    "simulation u10 differs from u15 by the smaller amount of internal energy injected into the host clump by the solid core ( planet ) . as the result",
    ", the disruption process is much more gradual and protracted in u10 than in u15 ( see  [ sec : gas ] ) .",
    "the @xmath178@xmath70 diagram shows a great deal of similarity between simulation u10 and u15 , but also some interesting differences .",
    "for example , the radial width of the disruption ring is narrower in the former .",
    "this makes intuitive sense as there is less internal energy input into the gas clump in u10 , and therefore the velocity `` kicks '' @xmath118 after the disruption are probably smaller than they are in u15 .    the inclination angle @xmath117 versus @xmath70 plot shows somewhat larger mean value and larger dispersion of @xmath117 in u10 than in u15 .",

    "[ fig : eb015_orbit_live ] on the `` gas - dominated '' central and the `` far - out '' population at @xmath192 au , then its fair to say that in simulation u10 the far - out population is all turned into the central gas - dominated one .",
    "all of these differences are explainable by the fact that the disruption process is more gradual in u10 , which means that the tidal tails ( arms ) of the host clump in the process of disruption ( cf .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : off00eb010vy_3p_snap ] ) survive for longer , before being circularised into a diffuse gaseous ring ( the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : off00eb010vy_3p_snap ] ) .",
    "this implies that the planetesimals are influenced stronger by these tidal tails , explaining a higher dispersion in inclination @xmath117 .",
    "in addition to that , the tidal tails `` shepherd '' the planetesimals out of the cloud , as in seen in the left panels of figures [ fig : off00eb015vy_late ] and [ fig : big_snap ] , causing bunching of the orbital parameters in the vertical bands evident in the top panel of figure [ fig : off00eb010vy_resum_live ] .",
    "as the spiral arms survive for longer in u10 than they do in u15 , the bunching effect is far stronger in the former than in the latter .",
    "figure [ fig : big_ana ] shows the orbital parameters of the unbound planetesimals at the end of simulation u0 .",
    "this figure shows , yet again , the familiar @xmath178@xmath70 correlation diagram but a significantly different distribution of planetesimal orbital inclinations .",
    "the red and the blue curves in this case were computed assuming two rings of planetesimals with @xmath193 and @xmath141 au , respectively , because the planetesimal disc is larger in u0 than in u10 and u15 , and we used @xmath194 ( see  [ sec : u15_unbind ] ) .",
    "the latter is chosen by trial and error to find a visually reasonable match to the distribution of orbits in the simulation .",
    "the much stronger bunching of planetesimals towards the @xmath195 plane is a testament to the different nature of the host clump disruption in u0 as compared to u10 and u15 . while in the latter two the inner region of the clump was the actual source of the disruption ( as the core accretion energy was dumped there ) , in u0 the innermost region is `` passive '' .",
    "therefore the disruption process , as experienced by the planetesimals initially located at @xmath196 au for this simulation , is much less abrupt , leading to even less inclined orbits for the unbound particles .",
    "in addition , as mentioned in [ sec : u15_unbind ] , the injection of energy stirs up strong convective motions in those simulations , pumping up asymmetries and thus orbital inclinations .    on the other hand , the larger dispersion in values of @xmath117 in the centre of the planetesimal ring , and the presence of the vertical bands in fig .",
    "[ fig : big_ana ] confirms that these features are formed by the tidal arms ( tails ) of the host clump before they are wound up and completely erased .",

    "figure [ fig : u0_sat ] shows the orbital parameters of the bound population of planetesimals in simulation u0 .",
    "there is a marked difference in these distributions compared with that for u15 and u10 . instead of a monotonic increase in eccentricities and inclinations with increasing @xmath70 , evident in figure [ fig : u15_u10_sat ] , here there is an almost a step - function change in the nature of the orbits .",

    "in this paper we considered the predictions of the td hypothesis for the `` planetesimal '' debris left over after the disruption of a single gas host clump .",

    "whereas planets could not have formed without planetesimals forming first in the ca picture , in the td hypothesis this is less clear . in the latter case ,",
    "once the initial proto solid core is born by gravitational collapse of the grain - dominated inner region of the host clump@xcite , further growth may be dominated by the proto solid core accreting @xmath0 cm to tens of cm grains .",
    "solids in this size range experience aerodynamic drag that is strong enough to dump possible centrifugal support and yet small enough to sediment to the centre of the host clump within its lifetime ( see fig .",
    "bodies in the planetesimal size range , i.e. , km - sized and larger , on the other hand , experience too weak an aerodynamic drag .",
    "they are not expected to join the solid core en masse if they have some orbital support due to an excess angular momentum or chaotic convective motions of the gas in the centre of the host clump . in this case",
    "planetesimals are no parent bodies of planets in the strict sense .    on the other hand , if turbulence , convection or angular momentum prevents small grains from reaching the proto solid core directly , turning most of these grains into planetesimals as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : birth ] , then the situation is less clear .",
    "if this happens sufficiently close to the proto solid core and planetesimal densities are high , most of that material can be subsequently accreted by the proto core somewhat like in the ca theory . in this case",
    "planetesimals are also building blocks of planets , with only those on larger less bound orbits managing to avoid being accreted onto the core .",
    "\\3 . related to the point above , the solid planetary cores and the planetesimal debris form at approximately same time in our picture .",
    "after host gas clump disruption , some of the solid debris around the planetary core could fall on it and be accreted in direct collisions , so that planetary growth could actually continue in a manner analogous to that of the later oligarchic stages of solid core assembly in the traditional scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , as velocity dispersion of the disrupted population is high , e.g. a fraction of a km  s@xmath206 , only large planetesimals of size @xmath207 km would continue their growth , whereas smaller objects would accrete on large bodies or fragment in collisions with smaller bodies .",
    "if they fragment to sizes as small as a few metres then their inward radial migration inside the gas disc becomes important .",
    "\\4 . also related to point ( 2 ) above , the mass budget of planetesimals can be potentially very different in the two planet formation theories . in the ca scenario",
    ", the initial population of planetesimals must have had a total mass larger than the total high - z element ( other than h and he ) mass of the resulting planets .",
    "this does not _ have to be _ the case in the td scenario .",
    "in particular , there does not seem anything wrong with assuming that the debris population may be far less massive than the protoplanetary core .",
    "\\5 . in the ca scenario ,",
    "the properties of the protoplanetary disc are expected to be a rather smoothly varying function of radius , except for the regions near the ice line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus one expects that planetesimal properties are also a smoothly varying function of @xmath208 .",
    "in contrast , in the td hypothesis , it is the host clump that determines the outcome of the planet formation process .",
    "the internal structure of the clump is a strong function of its mass @xcite ; that structure is non - uniquely coupled to radius @xmath208 where the clump is disrupted .",
    "it is possible that clumps of different history , mass , internal structure are disrupted at roughly same location .",
    "further , we envisage a number of host clumps forming and being destroyed during the early gas - rich phase as required to explain the fu ori outbursts of young protostars @xcite .",
    "this implies a far greater diversity in the properties of the solid debris at the same spatial location than is possible in the ca model .",
    "we found in this paper that disruption of a host gas clump generically produces a `` v''-shaped pattern in the eccentricity - semi - major axis space for the planetesimal population released by the disruption .",
    "the planetesimals in the centre of the pattern have nearly circular orbits while whose at the edges of it are much more eccentric .",
    "the maximum eccentricities possible can be estimated based on the simple analytical theory ; from equations [ ecc_a ] to [ w_predict ] , it follows that , within a factor of @xmath209 , it is @xmath210 for host clump mass of @xmath6 jupiter masses .",
    "the eccentricities and inclinations of the disrupted planetesimal population are generally much too high to allow planetesimals to stick to one another .",
    "the typical dispersion velocity of the disrupted population is @xmath211 . at the distance of the kuiper belt , for example ,",
    "this yields dispersion velocity of the order of @xmath212 m / s . only pluto - sized bodies could survive _ equal - size _ collisions at these velocities .",
    "accretion on massive solid cores , however , is allowed as already noted in ( 3 ) above , so the post - disruption evolution may be somewhat similar to the final phases of the run - away growth of planetary embryos in the traditional scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we also find that solid bodies on orbits tightly bound to the planetary core could survive the disruption of the gas host clump , remaining bound to the planet .",
    "these bodies are satellites of the planetary cores . satellites on orbits more strongly bound to the planet are affected by the gas envelope destruction less than those on less bound orbits . some of the outermost satellites may even find themselves in eccentric counter - rotating orbits ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ fig : u15_u10_sat ] ) .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to the satellites of the giant planets in the solar system , although we note that our simulations are not designed to study these issues ; one also would need to model composition , size differences and long - term survivability of the bound objects .      even though we did not specifically attempt to reproduce the structure of the outer solar system here ( which would require an additional study of how the system evolves on the 4.5 giga year time scale )",
    ", our simulations do have potentially interesting implications for it .",
    "we mention these implications only briefly here , with the intent of quantifying them in a future publication :    * one of the key properties of the trans - neptunian region of the solar system , including the kuiper belt , is the `` mass deficit problem '' .",
    "the current mass of the kuiper belt is estimated at @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , to grow the observed populations of solid bodies in the context of the @xcite model for formation of solids , 10 to 100 @xmath63 of solids is required ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , removal of @xmath214% of solid material is required . in the td hypothesis ,",
    "solids are made within the central fractions of au of the host gas clumps @xcite .",
    "the host clumps contain as much as @xmath215 of high - z elements @xcite which are then partially used to make the massive solid cores , the `` planetesimals '' , and partially remain bound to gas in small grains .",
    "if it is possible to build solid cores as massive as @xmath216 by direct gravitational collapse and accretion of @xmath0 cm size grains @xcite , it should also be possible to build pluto - sized objects _ without _ having to put tens of @xmath63 of material into the planetesimals .",
    "there is thus no mass deficit problem for the kuiper belt in the td scenario .",
    "* there is a sharp outer edge to the kuiper belt at around @xmath217 au which is currently not well understood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the disruption of a gas host clump naturally produces a ring with sharp outer and inner edges ( point 1 above ) because the range of orbits available to planetesimals after disruption is limited by the parameters of the initial host clump .",
    "this could naturally account for the outer edge of the kuiper belt objects .",
    "* the structure of the classical kuiper belt is best explained by our model if we assume that the left hand side ( lower @xmath70 ) of the disruption ring ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : big_ana ] ) has been destroyed by interactions with planets .",
    "realistically , the planet , left at @xmath218 au at the end of our simulations , could have continued to migrate inward via type i migration in the gas disc : the disrupted gas ring is still quite massive ( 5 jupiter masses for our simulations here , and there would be more at larger @xmath208 to effect the migration of the host clump in the first place ) . using the standard type - i gas migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for neptune initially located at @xmath219 au , assuming the disc mass being @xmath220 jupiter masses , and the gas disc aspect ratio of @xmath221 yields type i migration rate time scale of @xmath222 yrs .",
    "this is sufficiently fast to allow neptune to migrate inward significantly to end up , for example , in the configuration proposed by the nice model of the outer solar system @xcite .",
    "while migrating inward in the gas disc , neptune would have scattered the left part of the `` v''-pattern of the planetesimals , but leaving behind the right hand side of the pattern as a belt reminiscent of the kuiper belt .",
    "* kuiper belt contains the hot and the cold populations .",
    "these are best accounted for by two different gas clump disruptions in our model .",
    "the hot population in our model would have most naturally resulted if the host gas protoplanet rotation axis were highly inclined to the orbital plane . in this case",
    "one could end up with higher inclinations than we obtained here .",
    "* @xcite show that if planetesimals form by a local gravitational collapse in a high density environment , then one can naturally explain the surprisingly large fraction of binaries in the @xmath223100 km class low - inclination objects in the classical kuiper belt .",
    "we note that our model produces `` planetesimals '' in a similar fashion ( gravitational collapse in a high density environment ) albeit inside of the host clumps rather than the disc .",
    "therefore by extension one might expect to see a high fraction of massive objects locked in binaries after the dissipation of the host clump .",
    "this idea however needs to be checked with a longer time @xmath224-body calculation as there are non trivial physical constraints on collisional destruction of binaries in the kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "we have considered the origin of solid debris , such as comets , asteroids and large bodies such as pluto in the context of a recent planet formation hypothesis ( tidal downsizing ) .",
    "we assumed ( see  [ sec : birth ] ) that the solid `` debris '' is formed in a way very similar to the massive solid protoplanetary cores themselves , e.g. , inside the @xmath6 jupiter mass host gas clouds .",
    "the latter are eventually disrupted either tidally or due to an internal energy release during the solid core accretion . the release of these solid bodies into the field forms rings potentially reminiscent of the kuiper belt and the debris discs around nearby main sequence stars .",
    "while much work remains to be done to detail predictions of the td hypothesis further , it is already clear that these predictions are sufficiently different from the standard planetesimal - based paradigm for planet formation @xcite to be critically tested by observations in the near future .    as an astrophysical aside ,",
    "we note that the rapid accretion of large solid bodies ( pluto - like and even neptune - like ) in the td scheme suggests that planet and solid debris formation is a very robust process and may even occur in very crowded environments such as the inner parsecs of galaxies @xcite ; this is an untenable proposition in the ca model .",
