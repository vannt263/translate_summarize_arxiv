    "it is possible to formulate particle acceleration around shocks , in the test particle limit , in an exact form , for arbitrary shock speeds , and arbitrary anisotropies in the particle distribution function ( paper i , vietri 2003 ) .",
    "it turns out that the physically relevant boundary conditions are those at the shock , not those at downstream infinity .",
    "these conditions at the shock fix the particle spectrum which was shown to be ( under some simplifying assumptions ) an * exact * power  law in the particle momentum , independent of the shock speed and of all assumptions about the scattering properties of the medium .",
    "the exact value of the spectral index depends in a detailed way upon the diffusion properties of the media involved .",
    "it was shown in paper i that this dependence is encapsulated in two functions , @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively , which denote the conditional probabilities that a particle entering the upstream ( downstream ) medium along a direction @xmath2 , will leave it for the downstream ( upstream ) section along a direction @xmath3 . in paper i ( but see also freiling , vietri and yurko 2003 for some tricky mathematical details ) , these functions were built from the eigenfunctions of the angular part of the scattering problem . though conceptually satisfactory , this procedure is however computationally tricky , and one may wonder whether , given the scattering law for the particles , it may be possible to determine an equation for the scattering probabilities that yields them directly , without having to build the infinitely many eigenfunctions of the angular equation .",
    "it turns out that this is actually possible , by drawing upon the analogy with scattering atmospheres ( chandrasekhar 1949 ) , and by using an obvious symmetry property of the problem at hand .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present this derivation , and a handful of illustrative computations , with the major aim of showing the ability of the method to reproduce well  established results , drawn from the literature .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the spectra in several interesting cases , including the important hyperrelativistic regime , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we present the derivation of the equations which determine @xmath1 and @xmath4 . in section 3 , we show that a diffusive equation identical to that originally given by kirk and schneider ( 1987 ) is recovered in the fokker  planck regime ( or small  pitch  angle scattering , spas ) of our scattering equation , eq . [ main ] . in section 4 , we describe our full method to compute numerically the spectral slope and angular distribution function . in section 5",
    "we show that our method reproduces very well results which have already appeared in the literature , in the newtonian , trans - relativistic and fully relativistic regimes ( the ultra - relativistic regime will be discussed in forthcoming publication ) .",
    "we conclude in section 6 .",
    "in paper i , we showed that a suitable , relativistically covariant ( though not manifestly so ) equation for the transport of the particle distribution function for arbitrary pitch angle scattering in the presence of a large - coherence length magnetic field is : @xmath7 in this equation , @xmath8 is the distance from the shock along the shock normal , in the shock frame .",
    "all other quantities are measured in the fluid frame : @xmath9 is the fluid speed with respect to the shock , in units of @xmath10 , and @xmath11 its associated lorentz factor , @xmath12 is the df of particles with impulse @xmath13 in the fluid frame ( which , by assumption , does not change because we assumed pitch  angle scattering ) , and @xmath14 is the scattering probability that a particle , originally moving along a direction making an angle with the shock normal such that its cosine is @xmath15 , and along @xmath16 , be deflected along a new direction @xmath17 . the fluid is assumed to move in the positive @xmath8 direction , so that its speed is at all places @xmath18 , and the angles are measured from the direction of motion of the fluid .",
    "the scattering is assumed linear ( thus these results apply only in the test particle approximation ) , but the scattering angle is nowhere assumed small : we shall derive results for the diffusive approximation in a later section .",
    "this equation is the plane ",
    "geometry , fully relativistic version of an equation originally developed by gleeson and axford ( 1967 ) for spherically symmetric , non  relativistic shocks .    compared with eq .",
    "7 of paper i , the injection has been dropped because we are considering particles at very large energies , much larger than the injection energy ; we now also specialize to the case in which no long - coherence length magnetic field is present .",
    "the treatment of the problem in full generality will be presented elsewhere ( morlino , blasi and vietri , in preparation ) .",
    "besides dropping the term @xmath19 , we remark that the system has now become symmetric for rotations around the shock normal , so that the df @xmath12 will be independent of the angle @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , the elemental scattering probability @xmath21 can depend only on the angle @xmath22 between the incoming and outgoing direction , @xmath23 , even though it can depend separately upon @xmath3 and @xmath15 . in this symmetric case",
    ", we can average the previous equation over either @xmath20 or @xmath16 , obtaining @xmath24 where @xmath25 an equation which will be used later on .      in order to fix the ideas ,",
    "we consider the problem of determining @xmath5 , the conditional probability for the downstream frame ; we shall explain later how to adapt these results to the upstream frame .",
    "take the origin of coordinates to be located at the shock , the downstream section to be at @xmath26 , and define @xmath9 as the * modulus * of the shock speed with respect to the fluid .",
    "we are using variables in the fluid frame : @xmath3 is thus the cosine of the angle between the particle speed and the shock normal , _ in the fluid frame_. this means that the particles which can cross from upstream to downstream ( , those with a positive component along the shock normal of the velocity _ with respect to the shock _ ) are those with @xmath27 while those that cross the shock backwards , from the downstream to the upstream section , have @xmath28    now let @xmath12 represent a beam of particles , all entering the downstream section along the same direction , @xmath2 ; we showed in paper i that the particle flux across a surface fixed in the shock frame , but expressed in downstream coordinates , is given by : @xmath29 we consider now a pencil beam of particles , all moving initially in the direction @xmath2 .",
    "thus , at the shock : @xmath30 with @xmath31 an obvious normalization .",
    "it was shown in paper i that eq .",
    "[ fattheboundary1 ] provides a suitable boundary condition for eq .",
    "[ main ] , which then returns the outgoing flux ; by definition , this is precisely the required @xmath5 .",
    "we thus have @xmath32    to begin , let us define the inward ( @xmath33 ) and outward ( @xmath34 ) parts of the distribution function , and let us consider a surface at a distance @xmath8 from the shock , fixed in the shock frame .",
    "the flux of particles moving backwards toward the shock , through this surface , is : @xmath35 the minus sign accounts for the fact that @xmath36 , while all terms inside the integral are positive .",
    "strictly speaking , in the above equation , we should have written @xmath37 instead of simply @xmath38 .",
    "in other words , for a general situation , we can not assume that the conditional probability @xmath5 be independent of its location inside the downstream region .",
    "however , in this case this assumption is fully justified , because the downstream region is semi  infinite : in other words , it remains identical to itself whenever we add or subtract finite regions , and its diffusive properties also remain unaltered whenever we add or subtract finite regions .",
    "it follows that the conditional probability @xmath5 from some finite @xmath8 to downstream infinity must be exactly identical to that from @xmath39 to downstream infinity .",
    "this invariance principle , and this whole discussion , are identical to those in chandrasekhar ( 1949 , chapter 4 , sections 28 - 29 ) , and provide an exact justification for the equation above .",
    "we now differentiate the above with respect to @xmath8 : @xmath40 while eq .",
    "[ main ] gives us @xmath41 @xmath42 where we used the shorthand @xmath43 we now evaluate eq . [ mainminus ] at @xmath44 , using eqs .",
    "[ fattheboundary1 ] and [ fattheboundary2 ] , to obtain @xmath45 we can now proceed analogously for eq . [ mainplus ] : we again evaluate it at @xmath44 , and use eqs . [ fattheboundary1 ] and [ fattheboundary2 ] , to obtain : @xmath46 as our last step , we plug eqs .",
    "[ inter1 ] and [ inter2 ] into eq .",
    "[ star ] to obtain : @xmath47 which is the sought  after result : an equation relating @xmath5 only to the diffusion probability @xmath48 .",
    "a completely analogous derivation holds in this case .",
    "the pencil beam is now entering the upstream section , so that , at the shock , we have : @xmath49 and we have the obvious definition , from paper i : @xmath50 at a distance @xmath8 from the shock the flux of particles moving toward the shock is @xmath51 where the same argument about the use of @xmath52 instead of @xmath53 applies as above .",
    "we may evaluate the above equation at @xmath54 using eqs .",
    "[ mainminus ] and [ mainplus ] ( which still hold ) , and eqs .",
    "[ fattheboundary3 ] and [ fattheboundary4 ] , and plug the result into eq .",
    "[ star2 ] , to obtain @xmath55 which is our other final result .",
    "in this section , we wish to derive the small pitch  angle scattering ( spas ) limit of our scattering equation , which holds for arbitrary deflection angles , not just small ones . before proceeding with the derivation of the fokker ",
    "planck equation , we need to establish a very useful result . the function @xmath48 is not completely arbitrary , but is subject to the following requirement .",
    "we expect that , when the distribution function ( df ) is isotropic ( _ i.e. _ , when @xmath56 ) , there will be no further evolution : in other words , we expect in this case the rhs of the above equation to vanish .",
    "for this to occur , we shall not take the obvious condition @xmath57 but its stronger version , @xmath58 the above equation is a statement of detailed balance , which we may assume to hold because these scattering processes are exactly those which lead to isotropization of the df , if thermal equilibrium were to hold . in our case",
    "we have neglected ( for excellent , well  known reasons ) the exchange of energy of the particles with the background fluid , so we can not expect true thermal equilibrium to hold , but since we have included all major scattering processes , we expect equilibrium ( _ i.e. _ , detailed balance except for energy equipartition ) to hold at least in so far as the angular part is concerned .",
    "it is probably worthwhile to remark that a similar assumption on @xmath48 is made by chandrasekhar ( 1949 , ch .",
    "iv , section 31 , eq .",
    "29 - 1 ) .",
    "we now rewrite eq .",
    "[ main ] by means of a new scattering probability , @xmath59 , to be defined as follows : @xmath60 @xmath61 is simply the probability that a particle is deflected from its initial direction along @xmath15 , to a new direction @xmath62 . by means of this new quantity eq .",
    "[ main ] can be recast as : @xmath63 while the detailed balance equation becomes : @xmath64    the scattering equation in the form [ main2 ] is exactly identical to that given by landau and lifshtiz ( 1984 , section 21 , eq .",
    "21.1 ) , so that their derivation of the fokker ",
    "planck immediately applies .",
    "please note however that our sign convention differs from theirs : what we call @xmath65 is for them @xmath66 .",
    "following step by step their derivation we find that @xmath67 with the definitions @xmath68 @xmath69 in the two integrals above , we have taken the integration range to extend from @xmath70 to @xmath71 , because we have assumed the validity of the spas regime , in which case @xmath72 has one very strong , narrow peak around @xmath73 :    we show now that , as a consequence of detailed balance , @xmath74 .",
    "we first notice that @xmath75 where @xmath76 , because of detailed balance , so that @xmath77 we use the above into @xmath78 which can now be integrated by parts to yield @xmath79 we now use again detailed balance , and the variable change @xmath80 in the definite integral above , to obtain @xmath81 which , when inserted into eq .",
    "[ coeff1 ] , yields @xmath74 .",
    "we thus obtain , for the scattering equation in the spas , or fokker  planck , limit : @xmath82 with @xmath83 given by eq .",
    "[ coeff2 ] .",
    "the use of detailed balance implies that the scattering integral reduces , in the spas limit , to the divergence of a vector proportional to the gradient of the df , exactly like in the classical heat conduction problem .    as a simple test of this treatment",
    ", we now re - derive a well  known result , _",
    "i.e. _ , that , in the isotropic limit , @xmath84 with @xmath85 a constant .",
    "the isotropic limit means that the scattering coefficient probability @xmath61 can only depend on the angle @xmath86 between the directions of motion .",
    "we shall take thus @xmath87 where @xmath88 with @xmath89 a parameter which we take @xmath90 , in order to enforce the spas regime .",
    "also , we assume that @xmath91 is an even function of @xmath92 , with a single minimum around @xmath93 ( again , spas regime ) ; we also assume , for the moment , that @xmath61 is normalized to unity : @xmath94 and will come back to this assumption in a moment .",
    "we now compute @xmath83 from eq .",
    "[ coeff2 ] .",
    "since we shall be taking the limit @xmath95 , only the argument @xmath96 will contribute to the integral , so that , defining @xmath97 , we find @xmath98 @xmath99 so that the normalization condition , eq .",
    "[ norm ] requires @xmath100 @xmath83 then becomes @xmath101 which is clearly identical to eq .",
    "if we now assume @xmath61 to have arbitrary normalization ( because it represents the probability of scattering per unit time ) , we see that the above derivation is changed only through an inessential multiplicative constant .",
    "this completes our derivation .",
    "later on , we shall compare numerical results based upon our new approach with those which previous authors have obtained in the fully isotropic , small pitch angle scattering limit . in order to do this",
    ", we have to determine a suitable form for @xmath48 in this case .",
    "it is clear that any function very strongly peaked around the forward direction simulates the spas regime , like , for instance , @xmath102 however , not all such peaked functions reproduce the isotropic case , which is defined as that in which the _ elemental _ scattering probability @xmath21 is independent of anything except for the deflection angle : @xmath103 with @xmath104 given by @xmath105 we have seen above that the transport equation in the spas regime does not depend upon the exact form of the scattering function @xmath21 , so that we are free to choose any analytically tractable one .",

    "[ wpeaked ] when computing spectra , taking @xmath110 for the isotropic spas limit and @xmath111 for the isotropic large angle scattering regime .",
    "in this section we outline the procedure to follow in order to calculate the spectral slope and the angular distribution function of the accelerated particles , for an arbitrary choice of the shock velocity and of the scattering properties of the fluid .    for the purpose of making contact with previous literature on the subject ,",
    "we carry out our calculations with a scattering function @xmath112 as given in eq .",
    "[ wpeaked ] , choosing a small value of the parameter @xmath89 for the case of small pitch angle scattering , and a large value of @xmath89 to reproduce the regime of large angle scattering .",
    "[ wpeaked ] ensures that the scattering remains isotropic in both regimes .",
    "however , we wish to stress that we elected to use an isotropic scattering in order to make contact with all other authors ( so far ) , who have only used isotropic scattering , even though this is by no means required by our method , which can effectively deal with anisotropic scattering .",
    "it is worth stressing that our method does not require any intrinsic approximations or assumptions on the type of scattering ; the only approximations are due to round - off in the numerical solution of the integral equations for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the procedure for the calculation of the slope of the spectrum of accelerated particles is as follows : for a given lorentz factor of the shock ( @xmath113 ) , the velocity of the upstream fluid @xmath114 is calculated .",
    "we then determine the velocity of the downstream fluid @xmath115 from the conventional jump conditions at the shock , after assuming some equation of state for the post  shock fluid .",
    "given @xmath9 , @xmath115 and a scattering function @xmath48 , we can solve the integral equations for @xmath6 and @xmath5 iteratively .",
    "we recall here that these are functions of an entrance and an exit angle , and the convergence of the method can be numerically time consuming , in particular for small values of @xmath89 . aside from this numerical issue , one should also remember that our equations for @xmath6 and @xmath5 are analogous to the h - equation of chandrasekhar ( which is however in one dimension only ) which is known to admit multiple solutions .",
    "it has been shown however ( kelley 1982 ) that iterative methods always converge to the only physically meaningful solution , although no information is provided on how fast the convergence is achieved .    an important point to keep in mind is that the probability of return from the upstream section is strongly constrained through the condition that all particles must return to the shock , being advected with the fluid .",
    "it follows that @xmath116 for any value of the entrance angle @xmath117 .",
    "it should be stressed however that this integral constraint is not imposed by hand . in other words , though dictated by physical considerations , it is automatically implemented by the integral equation for @xmath6 ( eq . [ eq : pu ] ) : it thus provides an important numerical check of our computing accuracy .",
    "the slow convergence of the iterative solution of eq . [ mainpd ] has been partly corrected by use of the following ruse .",
    "the conditional probability @xmath5 obeys the following integral constraint . from eq .",
    "[ eq : transport ] we see that at downstream infinity the condition @xmath118 implies that the only physically acceptable solution for the distribution function is @xmath119 . at downstream infinity",
    "we can therefore write @xmath120 which implies the condition @xmath121 for any value of the exit angle @xmath3 . since the function @xmath5 depends only on the scattering properties of the fluid , which are assumed to be independent of @xmath8 , eq .",
    "[ eq : property ] also applies to any @xmath8 , including @xmath54 which is the position of the shock .",
    "this condition is of course automatically satisfied at the end of our calculations , while it is only approximately satisfied during the iterative solution of eq .",
    "[ mainpd ] .",
    "we have found out that , by correcting the normalization of @xmath5 so that it obeys the previous integral constraint to hold at the end of _ every _ iteration , the convergence is much accelerated , above all in the spas regime .",
    "we are unable to explain why this occurs , but shortening of the computation times by a factor of 3 , or more , have thus been achieved .",
    "once the two functions @xmath6 and @xmath5 have been calculated , the slope of the spectrum , as discussed in paper i , is given by the solution of the equation :    @xmath122    where @xmath123 here @xmath124 is the relative velocity between the upstream and downstream fluids and @xmath125 is the angular part of the distribution function of the accelerated particles , which contains all the information about the anisotropy . a point to notice concerns the function @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qt ] ) : all variables and functions here are evaluated in the downstream frame , while the @xmath6 calculated though eq .",
    "( [ eq : pu ] ) is in the frame comoving with the ( upstream ) fluid .",

    "( [ eq : qt ] ) is therefore @xmath126.\\ ] ] the solution for the slope @xmath127 of the spectrum is found by solving eq .",
    "[ eq : fred ] .",
    "in general , this equation has no solution but for one value of @xmath127 .",
    "finding this value provides not only the slope of the spectrum but also the angular distribution function @xmath125 .",
    "in this section we apply the method detailed above to several cases that have already been discussed in the literature , in order to show that the approach can be successfully applied to a variety of cases .",
    "more specifically , we consider the following test situations :    * since our method is not based on the assumption of small pitch angle scattering , we can demonstrate that the slope of the spectrum of particles accelerated at newtonian shocks is independent of the scattering function @xmath112 , although the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 in general do depend on the choice of @xmath48 .",
    "* to our knowledge , the only calculation of the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 which applies to shocks of arbitrary velocity for the case of large angle scattering is that of kato & takahara ( 2001 ) .",
    "we compare our results for @xmath5 and @xmath6 with those presented in that paper for a scattering function which reproduces the physical case of large angle scattering . *",
    "the slope of the spectrum of accelerated particles in the relativistic regime for the case of large angle scattering was compared with the results of monte carlo calculations carried out by ellison , jones and reynolds ( 1990 ) . *",
    "the case of small pitch angle scattering was assumed in most previous calculations .",
    "we test our approach in this regime in two ways : 1 ) by showing that the slope of the spectrum of accelerated particles in the spas approximation , as computed through our method for several values of the shock lorentz factor , compares well with the results presented in ( kirk et al . , 2000 ) ; 2 ) by comparing our angular distribution function with that obtained by kirk & schneider ( 1987 ) for a given relativistic shock velocity .",
    "the theoretical approach presented here allows us to determine the spectrum and the anisotropy in the particle distribution for arbitrary shock velocity and arbitrary scattering properties of the fluid . in this section",
    "we show that we can reproduce the results expected in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "we calculated the spectral slope and the angular part of the distribution function for several values of the shock velocity and shock compression factor @xmath128 .",
    "we also calculated the return probability from the downstream and upstream sections .",

    "the condition @xmath134 is confirmed for any value of @xmath117 within a part in @xmath135 . as a matter of fact , we checked that the above equality is satisfied in all cases we studied , relativistic or otherwise .",
    "the slope of the spectrum of accelerated particles for @xmath136 and @xmath130 ( compression factor 3 ) as calculated with our approach is 4.5 , in agreement with the theoretical prediction ( bell 1978 ) .",
    "we obtain the same slope in both cases of small pitch angle scattering with @xmath137 and large angle scattering , that we simulate by choosing @xmath138 ( but any large value gives the same result ) .",
    "the fact that in the newtonian limit the slope of the spectrum does not depend on the scattering properties of the fluid is also in agreement with the theoretical prediction of bell ( 1978 ) .",

    "this figure shows the expected phenomenon of increasing anisotropy in the distribution funtion when the shock speed increases : for non - relativistic speeds the distribution function is almost perfectly independent of the pitch angle @xmath3 , but it becomes more and more anisotropic in the trans - relativistic regime and in the fully relativistic regime .",
    "a necessary condition for the spas regime to be at work is that @xmath151 .",
    "this implies that the spas assumption requires increasingly lower values of @xmath89 when the lorentz factor of the shock increases . for @xmath152 , the maximum lorentz factor for which we can assume to be in the spas regime",
    "is @xmath153 , and in fact we can already see that the slopes that we obtain for @xmath154 are slightly smaller than those of kirk et al .",
    "this effect will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "it is worth reminding that the spas approximation is in fact expected to be broken in nature in the relativistic regime : this is due to the fact that a fp equation describes well the scattering only when particles scatter many times within a given angle . in the upstream section",
    ", particles are caught up by the shock as soon as their deflection angle with respect to the normal to the shock is larger than @xmath155 . for relativistic shocks , this quantity becomes small and eventually comparable with the average deflection angle per unit length , and a description by means of a fokker ",
    "planck equation becomes inadequate , as remarked many times in the literature ( kirk , 2000 ) .",
    "we stress here that the fact that our method is not based upon the spas approximation , but on the more general eq .",
    "[ eq : transport ] , makes it more widely applicable then previous approaches .",
    "its potential for a more correct investigation of the large @xmath156 limit will have to be investigated elsewhere .",
    "an additional evidence of how important these effects can be for the determination of the correct distribution function of the accelerated particles is illustrated below .",
    "we calculate here the spectrum and the function @xmath125 for @xmath146 and for the relativistic equation of state for the downstream gas ( @xmath157 ) , as adopted by kirk & schneider ( 1987 ) .",
    "we carry out our calculations for @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "the slopes in the four cases are very close to each other ( @xmath160 ) but the angular distribution functions ( normalized to be unity at the peak ) appear slightly different .",
    "it is remarkable however that when the spas regime is approached , the df converges exactly to that found by kirk & schneider ( 1987 ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmu ] , where we plotted @xmath125 for the four cases mentioned above : compare our results with kirk and schneider s fig . 6 .",
    "the slope that we obtain is also in perfect agreement with kirk & schneider ( 1987 ) .",
    "in paper i , a new analytic approach to the calculation of the spectrum of particles accelerated at a shock surface moving with arbitrary velocity was proposed . in the present paper we described the procedure to calculate the probability functions @xmath139 and",
    "@xmath140 introduced in paper i. these two functions allow us to calculate the spectrum and the angular distribution function of the accelerated particles at the shock , for arbitrary shock velocity and for arbitrary scattering function @xmath48 .",
    "we tested the approach in several situations , in order to show that all results previously appeared in the literature could be successfully reproduced .",
    "in particular the following tests have been performed :    * we confirmed the universality of the slope of the power law spectrum of accelerated particles in the case of newtonian shocks .",
    "more specifically we proved that such slope is roughly independent of the scattering properties of the medium , as described by the scattering function @xmath48 .",
    "it should be stressed that such universality does not extend to the probability functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which are instead strongly dependent upon the scattering properties . despite the difference between these probability functions , their combination results in an angular part of the distribution function of accelerated particles which is approximately flat , as expected in the newtonian limit ( isotropy ) .",
    "* we checked the correctness of the probability functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the case of large angle scattering by comparing our results with those of kato & takahara ( 2001 ) .",
    "we emphasize that these two functions contain all the physical information about the spectrum and angular distribution of the accelerated particles .",
    "* we reproduce exceptionally well the results of the monte carlo experiments of ellison et al .",
    "( 1990 ) on the slope of the spectrum of accelerated particles as a function of the shock compression ratio for different shock speeds , in the large angle scattering regime , but not kato and takahara s ( 2001 ) results .",
    "we ascribed this discrepancy to kato and takahara s use of the ( incorrect ) peacock s formula for the spectral slope .",
    "* we carried out calculations for the case of a scattering function very peaked as a function of the difference between the cosines of the entrance and exit angles .",
    "we adopted a @xmath48 in the form given by our eq .",
    "[ wpeaked ] .",
    "the case of small @xmath89 is expected to describe the limit of isotropic small pitch angle scattering , which is adopted in most literature on shock acceleration .",
    "we showed that in this limit the transport equation ( eq . [ eq : transport ] ) reduces to a fokker - planck equation , identical to that used for instance by kirk & schneider ( 1987 ) and kirk et al .",
    "we carried out computations for @xmath161 , and we compared our predicted spectral slopes with those of kirk et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for different values of the shock velocity .",
    "our results are illustrated in table 1 and show that our method reproduces faily well the spas results .",
    "moreover , our approach shows the expected deviations from the spas regime when the condition @xmath162 is violated .",
    "* we have also compared our distribution function at the shock with that published by kirk and schneider ( 1987 ) , obtaining very good agreement , and an identical slope .",
    "we also show that the distribution function becomes increasingly different when the strict spas regime is broken ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gmu ] ) .    on the basis of the tests carried out to check our approach",
    ", we can claim that this method of calculation of the spectrum and angular distribution function of particles accelerated at shocks of * arbitrary velocity * and * arbitrary * ( but spatially homogeneous ) scattering properties of the fluid is fully successful in reproducing old results , and it can now be applied to situations which go beyond the well studied case of small pitch angle scattering . in a forthcoming paper we will describe the potential of this new approach to describe particle acceleration at ultra - relativistic shocks , including the effect of a possible large scale magnetic field ."
