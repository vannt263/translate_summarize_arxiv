    "the evolution in the cosmic star formation rate density ( sfrd ) is an important observational constraint for all the current models of galaxy formation and evolution @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that the sfrd reached its peak around @xmath10 , and since then has declined by roughly an order of magnitude @xcite . however , the details of this evolution remain poorly understood , in part because of the systematic uncertainties associated with the patchwork of various star formation rate ( sfr ) indicators .    for example , in the nearby universe , the strength of the h@xmath11 emission line is one of the most direct and robust measures of ongoing star formation , since it is powered by the photoionization produced by massive ( @xmath12 ) , young ( @xmath13  myr ) stars @xcite . unfortunately ,",
    "at distances greater than @xmath14 , this line redshifts out of the optical and into the near - ir portion of the spectrum , where it is much more difficult to observe @xcite .",
    "consequently , by @xmath15 , the [ o  ii ] @xmath2 emission line , which is produced by collisional excitation , has taken the place of h@xmath11 @xcite , and by @xmath16 , the preferred indicator of star formation is the rest - frame ultraviolet continuum @xcite . like the emission - line indicators ,",
    "the rest - frame uv directly traces the flux of young , massive stars , but in this case , the timescale over which the star formation is measured is @xmath17  myr , and the result is much more sensitive to internal extinction .",
    "mid - ir measurements , which reflect the re - radiation of stellar emission by warm dust , integrate star formation over an even longer ( @xmath18  gyr ) timescale @xcite , further complicating the interpretation of the low-@xmath19 epoch , when the sfrd of the universe is evolving rapidly .    in practice , a large number of additional star formation rate indicators are used both at high and low redshift , and these span the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from 1.4  ghz radio and far - ir bands to the x - ray ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "one of the most versatile of these is the flux from the [ o  ii ] doublet at 3727   . as a sfr indicator , [ o  ii ] has two significant advantages over measurements in the near and far uv : it is easier to detect at low and intermediate ( @xmath20 ) redshifts and it is more sensitive to the instantaneous star formation rate , rather than the @xmath17  myr time - averaged rate .",
    "unfortunately , the path from [ o  ii ] emission to star formation rate is much less direct than for either h@xmath11 or the near - uv , as the emission depends on parameters such as the galactic oxygen abundance and the ionization state of the gas @xcite .",
    "thus , the method must be calibrated empirically via comparisons to other sfr indicators @xcite .    over the past 15 years",
    ", there have been several [ o  ii]-based measurements of sfrds , mostly at @xmath9 and @xmath15 .",
    "many of these studies derive from spectroscopic observations of magnitude - limited samples of galaxies , and are thus severely incomplete at the faint end of the emission - line luminosity function @xcite .",
    "others are based on narrow - band surveys of selected high redshift ( @xmath21 ) epochs , and are thus only sensitive to high equivalent width objects @xcite .",
    "still others employ near - ir fabry - perot observations and are restricted to the very brightest ( @xmath18  dex ) [ o  ii ] emitters at @xmath15 @xcite . consequently , while the local ( @xmath22 ) [ o  ii ] luminosity function is reasonably well defined @xcite , measurements of the evolution of [ o  ii ] @xmath2 emission over the last @xmath3  gyr of cosmic time are rather limited .",
    "in fact , the only studies that attempt to sample the full - range [ o  ii ] over these intermediate redshifts are the _ hubble space telescope",
    "_ grism surveys of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these @xmath23 observations are limited by a rather high equivalent width limit ( @xmath24   ) , and a lack of information concerning the galaxies internal extinction .",
    "there is , however , one other dataset that can be exploited to measure the evolution of [ o  ii ] emission in the nearby universe .",
    "the pilot survey for the hobby - eberly telescope dark energy experiment ( hetdex ) obtained blind integral field spectroscopy over 169  arcmin@xmath1 of sky and measured [ o  ii ] @xmath2 fluxes for 284 galaxies between @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "only a few [ o  ii ] surveys cover this redshift range , and most are defined by magnitude - limited samples of objects .",
    "in contrast , the hetdex pilot survey s dataset is emission - line flux limited , rather than continuum flux limited , and is thus complete to much lower star formation rates than surveys which choose their targets via broadband measurements .",
    "the observations therefore sample a section of parameter space rarely probed by other investigations , and is a unique resource for studying the relationship between [ o  ii ] and other star formation rate indicators . moreover , because the hetdex pilot survey was conducted in fields with large amounts of ancillary data , we also have access to each galaxy s spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , enabling a full examination of its photometric properties and internal reddening .",
    "finally , because the survey s redshift range covers the last @xmath3  gyr of cosmic time , the database can be used to trace the late - time evolution of [ o  ii ] , and provide a comparison for sfrd measurements obtained at higher redshift .    in this paper , we present an analysis of the [ o  ii ] @xmath2 emission - line galaxies found in the hetdex pilot survey . in  2 , we summarize the observations and the selection method which produced the catalog of 284 [ o  ii ] line emitters . in  3 , we present the evolution of the [ o  ii ] equivalent width distribution with redshift , and use this reddening - independent quantity to show how the relative importance of star formation has declined over the last @xmath3  gyr . in  4 , we examine the internal extinction of the [ o  ii ] emitters , and compare the star formation rates derived from the measurements of the [ o  ii ] flux to those determined via the rest - frame uv continuum . in  5 , we present both observed- and extinction - corrected [ o  ii ] luminosity functions and explore the evolution of the cosmic sfrd out to @xmath8 .",
    "we conclude by discussing the implications of our work for future surveys of star - forming galaxies .    throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath26cdm cosmology with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 km  s@xmath30  mpc@xmath30 .",
    "the data for our analysis were taken as part of the hetdex pilot survey , a blind integral - field spectroscopic study of four areas of sky containing a wealth of ancillary multi - wavelength data : cosmos @xcite , goods - n @xcite , munics - s2 @xcite , and xmm - lss @xcite .",
    "a complete description of this pathfinding survey and its data products is given in @xcite .",
    "briefly , a square 246-fiber array was mounted on the harlan j. smith 2.7-m telescope at mcdonald observatory , and coupled to the george and cynthia mitchell spectrograph , a proto - type of the visible integral - field replicable unit spectrograph ( virus ) designed for hetdex @xcite .",
    "this instrument was set to disperse the wavelength range between 3600    and 5800    at @xmath3    resolution and 1.1    pixel@xmath30 .",
    "each fiber subtended @xmath31 on the sky ; consequently , the entire fiber array covered an area of @xmath32 with a 1/3 fill factor . to fill in the fiber gaps and improve the survey",
    "s spatial resolution , each field was observed using a 6-pointing dither pattern , generating @xmath33 separate spectra . in total , the pilot survey covered 169  arcmin@xmath1 of blank sky ( 71.6  arcmin@xmath1 in cosmos , 35.5  arcmin@xmath1 in goods - n , 49.9  arcmin@xmath1 in munics - s2 , and 12.3  arcmin@xmath1 in xmm - lss ) with 1 hour of exposure time at each dither position .",
    "fifty percent of the pointings reached a @xmath34 monochromatic flux limit of @xmath35  ergs  @xmath36  s@xmath30 at 5000   , and 90% reached @xmath37  ergs  @xmath36  s@xmath30 .",
    "simulations demonstrate that for objects with equivalent widths greater than @xmath3   , the recovery fraction of emission lines integrated across all continuum brightnesses is greater than 95% , and even for equivalent widths as small as 1   , the completeness fraction is better than 90% .",
    "the goal of the hetdex pilot survey was to test the equipment , analysis procedures , and ancillary data requirements for the main hetdex survey @xcite by performing an unbiased search for emission - line objects over a wide range of redshifts . to do this ,",
    "each sky - subtracted fiber spectrum was first flux - calibrated and then searched for the presence of emission lines . when a candidate emission feature was found , the cosmos , goods - n , munics - s2 , and xmm - lss imaging data were used to identify the line s photometric counterpart .",
    "the combination of the spectroscopic line flux and the photometrically determined continuum flux density were then used to calculate the line s equivalent width .",
    "the identity of the emission line and the object s most - likely redshift were then determined using either 1 ) the presence of multiple emission lines in the spectrum , 2 ) the source s photometric spectral - energy distribution ( as determined from the multi - wavelength images ) , or 3 ) the emission - line s rest - frame equivalent width .",
    "the latter criterion is particularly useful for discriminating ly@xmath11 from local [ o  ii ] @xmath2 , as single - line sources with rest - frame equivalent widths greater than 20    are almost always ly@xmath11 emitters @xcite .    in total , the hetdex pilot survey identified 397 emission - line sources , including 104 ly@xmath11 emitters @xcite , and 284 [ o  ii ] emission line galaxies .",
    "the latter have redshifts between @xmath38 , [ o  ii ] emission - line luminosities between @xmath39 ( ergs  @xmath36  s@xmath30 ) , and [ o  ii ] rest - frame equivalent widths as great as 77   .",
    "before examining the issue of star formation in our emission - line galaxies , we first must consider the effect that active galactic nuclei have on our [ o  ii ] fluxes .",
    "the pilot survey spectra do not have the wavelength coverage to employ traditional line - ratio diagnostics such as [ n  ii]/h@xmath11 or [ o  iii]/h@xmath40 for agn detection @xcite .",
    "however , because the fields chosen for study have been studied with the chandra and xmm observatories , we can identify probable agn contaminants via x - ray luminosity .    in @xcite",
    ", x - ray counterparts were identified for 30 of the hetdex pilot survey s [ o  ii ] emitters",
    ". however , many of these objects are in the goods - n region , where the chandra images are deep enough to detect the x - rays associated with normal star formation @xcite . if we exclude the [ o  ii ] emitters with luminosities fainter than @xmath41  ergs  s@xmath30 in the 2 to 8  kev x - ray band , we are left with 10 probable agn : 5 in goods - n ( which has the deepest x - ray coverage ) , and 5 in the other three fields .",
    "this number , which represents @xmath42 of the sample , is slightly greater than the agn contamination rate of 1 to 2% estimated by @xcite in their analysis of the line - ratios and x - ray emission of @xmath15 [ o  ii ] emitters in the deep2 survey .",
    "since the x - ray luminosity limits used here are more than an order of magnitude fainter than those considered by @xcite , we judge this agreement to be acceptable .    of course ,",
    "just because an object emits x - rays , it does not necessarily follow that the system s integrated [ o  ii ] emission is dominated by flux from the central engine .",
    "@xcite has shown that the physical conditions in the narrow - line regions of agn disfavor the creation of strong [ o  ii ] .",
    "indeed , an examination of the x - ray bright objects in our survey demonstrates that these likely agn are generally not amongst the brightest [ o  ii ] sources .",
    "consequently , their existence does not substantially alter the observed [ o  ii ] luminosity function or equivalent width distribution , nor do they effect the main conclusions of this paper .",
    "we therefore exclude these agn candidates from our analysis .",
    "one quick but very coarse way of examining the relative importance of star formation as a function of time is through the use of the distribution of [ o  ii ] @xmath2 rest - frame equivalent widths .",
    "the [ o  ii ] flux from a galaxy generally measures the amount of star formation in the very recent past ,  @xmath13  myr @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the continuum underlying 3727    in large part reflects star formation over a much longer ( @xmath18  gyr ) timescale @xcite .",
    "thus , by forming the ratio of these two quantities , it is possible to examine the relative importance of the current burst of star formation in a manner that reduces the complications introduced by internal extinction .    in the local neighborhood , the distribution of [ o  ii ] @xmath2 rest - frame",
    "equivalent widths peaks near @xmath3   , and then rapidly decays , as would an exponential with a scale length of @xmath43    @xcite .",
    "notably , this function has virtually no dependence on the brightness of the galaxy : the distribution of rest - frame [ o  ii ] equivalent widths for the @xmath44 galaxies discovered in the las campanas redshift survey is almost independent of @xmath45-band luminosity @xcite . similarly , there is no evidence for a correlation between luminosity and equivalent width in an h@xmath11 grism - survey of the local universe : if we divide the 191 galaxies of the @xcite survey in half and perform an anderson - darling test @xcite , we find no statistical difference between the distributions of [ o  ii ] equivalent widths for the high- and low - line luminosity samples .",
    "figure  [ ew_stagger ] displays the rest - frame [ o  ii ] equivalent width distribution for the hetdex pilot survey s sample of emission - line galaxies , as a function of redshift and [ o  ii ] luminosity .",
    "specifically , the figure sub - divides our sample of [ o  ii ] emitting galaxies into four redshift bins , and histograms the rest - frame equivalent widths for galaxies in the top - half and bottom - half of the emission - line luminosity function .",
    "the location of each histogram illustrates the redshifts and ( approximate ) luminosities of the galaxies contained within it .",
    "the dotted line in the figure illustrates the data s `` 80% completeness limit , ''",
    "80% of the fields observed in the survey have @xmath46 detection limits brighter than this value .",
    "only one out of the 42 galaxies at @xmath22 has a line - luminosity brighter than @xmath47 ; this is partially a volume effect , as the probability of finding a high - luminosity target in the nearby universe is small .",
    "conversely , at @xmath48 , low - luminosity [ o  ii ] emitters fall below the flux limit of the survey . nevertheless , despite this selection effect",
    ", it is clear that any dependence of equivalent width on [ o  ii ] luminosity is minimal .",
    "while we can not exclude the possibility of a small luminosity dependence in the equivalent width distribution , an anderson - darling test finds no significant difference between the high - luminosity and low - luminosity samples , even at the @xmath49 level .",
    "conversely , the redshift dependence of the rest - frame [ o  ii ] equivalent width distribution is quite strong , with the number of high - equivalent width objects increasing rapidly with redshift . at @xmath22 , the median rest - frame [ o  ii ]",
    "equivalent width is @xmath50   , a value only slightly larger than the 7.5    median found locally from the magnitude - limited las campanas survey @xcite . by @xmath48",
    ", however , the median equivalent width has increased to @xmath51   .",
    "qualitatively , this shift is similar to that seen in the magnitude - selected samples of galaxies observed by @xcite and @xcite , although in these studies , most of the increase occurs at @xmath52 . the slitless _ hst _ measurements of @xcite imply a much larger equivalent width scale length ( @xmath53   ) with no significant evolution between @xmath54 .",
    "however , since these parallel _ stis _ observations were only sensitive to objects with ew@xmath55   , our new measurements are not necessarily in conflict with their result .",
    "@xcite have shown that for a local , magnitude - limited sample of galaxies , the distribution of [ o  ii ] equivalent - widths is well - fit with a log - normal function with a mean of @xmath56  and dispersion of @xmath57   .",
    "when we fit our emission - line selected data in this way , we obtain a slightly larger value for the mean of the distribution , @xmath58    for all but the highest redshift bin , and a standard deviation that gradually increases from @xmath59    at @xmath60 to @xmath18    at @xmath8 .",
    "such a parameterization does reproduce the turnover seen at small equivalent widths , while maintaining the high - equivalent width tail of the distribution .",
    "it is , however , not the most intuitive of functions , especially for visualizing the evolution of the strongest [ o  ii ] line emitters .",
    "thus , to quantify the evolution of the high - equivalent width objects displayed in figure  [ ew_stagger ] , we chose to use a simple exponential law .",
    "we excluded those objects with equivalent widths less than 5   , combined the low and high - luminosity samples at each redshift , and computed the relative likelihood that the observed data were drawn from a model exponential with scale length , @xmath61 . in order to account for the heteroskedastic nature of the dataset",
    ", we performed this experiment 1000 times , using different realizations based on the quoted uncertainties of each measurement .",
    "as the probability curves of figure  [ ew_curves ] demonstrate , the scale length of the rest - frame [ o  ii ] equivalent width distribution increases smoothly with redshift , going from @xmath62    at @xmath22 to @xmath63    at @xmath48 .",
    "the simple interpretation of this trend is that over the past @xmath3  gyr , the relative intensities of individual starbursts has decreased linearly with time .",
    "before we can translate the hetdex [ o  ii ] luminosities into star formation rates , we must first examine the effect that internal extinction has on each galaxy s emergent emission - line flux .",
    "often times , this is done by applying a mean reddening correction to the population of galaxies as a whole @xcite ; in other cases , a mean extinction is defined as a function of galaxy absolute magnitude @xcite . however , a more robust way of handling the problem is to de - redden each galaxy individually using information from the galaxy itself .",
    "although the hetdex spectra lack sufficient wavelength coverage to constrain internal extinction via the balmer decrement , all of the survey fields have been imaged in a variety of bandpasses , from the uv ( with galex ) through the near - ir .",
    "thus , it is possible to obtain an estimate of each object s internal extinction by fitting its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to models of galactic evolution .    to do this",
    ", we used the population synthesis code of @xcite to create a three - dimensional grid of models using the assumptions of solar - metallicity stellar evolution @xcite , a @xcite initial mass function , and a @xcite reddening law . in total ,",
    "504 models were produced , using four different values for the e - folding timescale of star formation ( @xmath6410 , 50 , 100 , and 500  myr ) , 21 logarithmically spaced galactic ages ( @xmath65  gyr ) , and six uniformly spaced values for the stellar reddening ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "we then found the best - fitting values of @xmath67 , and @xmath68 by fitting each galaxy s observed multicolor photometry to the computed colors of the grid via a @xmath69 minimization code .",
    "obviously , single - component population synthesis models such as these are somewhat limited , as they cover only a small part of galaxy parameter space .",
    "nevertheless , the models do provide some guidance as to a galaxy s internal extinction , and therefore represent an important improvement in the study of the evolution of star formation .",
    "figure  [ reddening ] shows the sed - based stellar reddenings for our sample of [ o  ii ] emitters , as a function of galactic absolute magnitude and redshift . for the figure",
    ", we have adopted the extinction curve of @xcite , along with the relation @xmath70 which @xcite inferred from uv , far - ir , and balmer - line observations of @xmath53 starburst galaxies in the local neighborhood .",
    "the figure confirms the well - known correlation between a galaxy s absolute magnitude and extinction @xcite .",
    "indeed , the use of equation  ( [ eq_calzetti ] ) recovers the relation observed by @xcite for galaxies in the local neighborhood .",
    "also , this is no clear evidence for a shift in the relation with redshift , although the size of the dispersion ( @xmath71 ) , the limited number of objects , and the dependence of survey volume and completeness on redshift all conspire to make measurements of the evolution of extinction difficult . the full sample of @xmath72 hetdex galaxies will greatly improve upon this situation @xcite .",
    "another test of the robustness of our reddening estimates is to compare the de - reddened [ o  ii ] @xmath2 luminosities with the galaxies de - reddened near - uv magnitudes , as recorded in the gr6 catalog of galex @xcite .",
    "both datasets probe the presence of hot , young stars : [ o  ii ] through the indirect detection of ionizing radiation , and the uv via the direct measurement of the stellar continuum of hot stars .",
    "however , according to the @xcite extinction law , the extinction that effects [ o  ii ] @xmath2 emission line is @xmath73  times greater than that which extinguishes a galaxy s uv continuum .",
    "consequently , any systematic error in our reddening estimates should be easily visible in a comparison of the inferred star formation rates .    to perform this test",
    ", we used the uv continuum star formation rate calibration of @xcite @xmath74 and the empirical [ o  ii ] @xmath2 calibration of @xcite @xmath75 ) } ( m_{\\odot}~{\\rm yr}^{-1 } ) = 6.58 \\times 10^{-42 } \\ , l({\\rm [ o~ii]})\\ ( { \\rm ergs~s}^{-1})\\ ] ] both of these calibrations assume a @xcite initial mass function truncated at @xmath76 and present - day solar metallicity .",
    "( because of our limited wavelength coverage , no @xmath77 abundance correction could be applied to the [ o  ii ] luminosities . )",
    "if our reddening estimates are robust , and if the @xcite extinction law holds , the ratio of these two star formation rate indicators should be one .",
    "figure  [ sfr_comp ] performs this comparison . in the figure ,",
    "an sed - based @xmath78-correction has been applied to the galex near - uv magnitudes , and both quantities have been corrected for internal extinction using the @xcite reddening law . from the figure , it is clear that the two star formation indicators are strongly correlated .",
    "the best - fit slope of the relation , as determined by the buckley - james and em algorithms for censored data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is just slightly less than one ( @xmath79 ) , with the offset in the direction predicted by @xcite for high star formation rate systems .",
    "interestingly , the scatter about this line , ( @xmath80  dex ) is three times larger than the typical @xmath81  dex errors associated with our [ o  ii ] and uv measurements , and significantly greater than the @xmath82  dex dispersion seen in local comparisons of h@xmath11 and [ o  ii ] star formation rates @xcite .",
    "part of this scatter is likely due to our use of the mean @xcite calibration for [ o  ii ] emission ; without spectral measurements at [ o  iii ] @xmath83 and h@xmath40 , we can not apply second - order corrections to compensate for the ionization state and oxygen abundance of the gas .",
    "in addition , the extinction that affects the forbidden [ o  ii ] emission line is not necessarily that which extinguishes the uv continuum : while equation  ( [ eq_calzetti ] ) works well in the mean , there should be a non - negligible amount of dispersion about this relation .",
    "thus , even if our sed - based extinction estimates were perfect , our error budget would still have this additional reddening term .",
    "finally , some component of the scatter may be driven by the stochastic nature of star formation .",
    "emission - line sfr indicators , such as h@xmath11 and [ o  ii ] @xmath2 , record star formation over the past @xmath84  myr , while measurements of the stellar uv continuum probe a timescale that is @xmath3  times longer @xcite .",
    "the scatter between the two indicators must necessarily be larger than that seen in an h@xmath11-[o  ii ] comparison . in any case",
    ", the figure confirms that our estimates for internal reddening are reasonable and should not inject any large systematic effects into our analysis .",
    "to measure the [ o  ii ] emission - line luminosity function , we began by following the procedures described in @xcite and applied the @xmath85 technique @xcite to the 360 separate dithered pointings of the hetdex pilot survey .",
    "as described in @xcite , the noise characteristics of each survey frame were recorded as a function of wavelength .",
    "consequently , for each [ o  ii ] emitter in the sample , we could calculate @xmath86 , the co - moving volume of all redshifts at which the object could have been detected with a signal - to - noise ratio above a given threshold .",
    "the implied number density of galaxies in any absolute luminosity bin , @xmath87 , is then @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the inverse of the completeness function , and the summation is performed over all galaxies with luminosities falling within the bin .",
    "figure  [ lf ] displays these derived [ o  ii ] luminosity functions ( both observed and de - reddened ) for the redshift intervals @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in each panel , we have excluded the likely agn ( 3 objects in panels 1 , 2 , and 4 , and 1 object in panel 3 ) , binned the data into @xmath94  intervals , and drawn error bars based on the bin s counting statistics .    as can be seen from the top segments of the figure , our @xmath22 observed luminosity function is in very good agreement with that derived for @xmath22 galaxies in sdss stripe 82 @xcite . in this lowest redshift bin ,",
    "our survey volume is only @xmath95  mpc@xmath96 , hence intrinsically rare objects which populate the extreme bright - end of the luminosity function are poorly represented .",
    "however , at fainter line - luminosities our function is reasonably well - fixed at a level that is @xmath97 higher than that found by @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the expectations , as for the galactic number densities under consideration , the effects of cosmic variance should be of this order @xcite .    at redshifts @xmath98 ,",
    "there is clear evidence for evolution , both in the observed luminosity function and , more dramatically in the de - reddened function . to quantify these changes",
    ", we fit the data of figure  [ lf ] to a @xcite function , @xmath99 and examined the behavior of @xmath4 and @xmath100 as a function of redshift . while other forms of the luminosity function are possible  both @xcite and @xcite use double power laws for their [ o  ii ] datasets  our sample of objects is not large enough to warrant the introduction of additional parameters into our analysis . quantifying the evolution of the bright , intrinsically rare [ o  ii ] emitters",
    "requires a much larger survey volume , such as that which will be covered by the full hetdex program .",
    "to fit the luminosity functions of figure  [ lf ] , we avoided the limitations associated with our finite - sized bins , and used a maximum - likelihood analysis .",
    "we began by computing @xmath101 , the true luminosity function ( in galaxies per cubic megaparsec ) from which the data of figure  [ lf ] are drawn , modified by observational selection effects , such as photometric errors and incompleteness . by definition , in a given volume of the universe , @xmath102 , and within a given luminosity interval , @xmath103 , we should expect to observe @xmath104 galaxies . from simple poisson statistics , the probability of actually observing @xmath105 galaxies in that same interval is @xmath106 if we shrink the bin size down to zero so that the interval becomes a differential , then each division of the luminosity function will contain either zero or one object .",
    "the probability of observing any given luminosity function is then @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the total number of galaxies observed . with a little manipulation ,",
    "this becomes @xmath109 or , in terms of relative log likelihoods @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the luminosity limit of the survey at redshift @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath101 was then varied to map out the distribution of likelihoods as a function of @xmath112 , @xmath11 , and the mean density of galaxies brighter than given line luminosity",
    ". note that this style of analysis is similar to the classical method of @xcite , with the double integral term providing the normalization for @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ prob1 ] shows the likelihood contours for the observed luminosity function .",
    "the left - hand panels marginalizes over the integral of the luminosity function ( which serves as a proxy for @xmath100 ) and shows the probabilities as a function of @xmath11 and @xmath112 ; the right - hand side marginalizes over @xmath11 .",
    "the first feature to notice is that the faint - end slope of our function is poorly defined ; this is a natural consequence of the limited number of objects in our sample .",
    "literature estimates of @xmath11 vary substantially , from @xmath114 @xcite to @xmath115 @xcite , but our data imply slopes that are even shallower .",
    "however , this result is quite sensitive to the incompleteness corrections which have been applied to the measurements near the @xmath116 detection limits . for the discussion that follows",
    ", we fix @xmath114 , while noting that shallower ( or steeper ) slopes can not be excluded .",

    "these fits are also displayed in the left - hand panel of figure  [ lf ] . in the two lowest redshift bins ( @xmath117 ) where our survey volume is relatively small ,",
    "the bright - end of the luminosity function is sparsely populated , and the exact location of @xmath4 is defined as much by our assigned value of @xmath11 and by the absence of luminous objects as the presence of @xmath118 galaxies .",

    "these values are significantly fainter than those measured in the higher redshift bins , where our survey volume is larger , and the knees of the luminosity functions are better populated .",
    "overall , the data imply an increase in @xmath4 of @xmath121  mag per unit redshift over the redshift limits of our survey .",
    "figure  [ prob2 ] shows the results of our maximum - likelihood fits after de - reddening the [ o  ii ] @xmath2 line - luminosity of each galaxy using our sed - based extinction values .",
    "predictably , the evolution of @xmath4 with redshift is stronger than for the raw luminosity function . as pointed out by a number of authors",
    "@xcite , the amount of extinction affecting a galaxy s emission lines strongly correlates with its star formation rate , with more active galaxies possessing more internal extinction .",
    "consequently , as the knee of the observed luminosity function shifts towards brighter values , the amount of internal reddening increases , leading to a larger shift in the de - reddened value of @xmath4 . at @xmath22 ,",
    "the difference between the best - fitting observed and de - reddened values of @xmath4 is @xmath122  dex ; by @xmath8 , this offset becomes at least @xmath123  dex .",
    "the brightening of @xmath4 with redshift increases the importance of internal reddening , and explains why our de - reddened values for @xmath4 are brighter than those of @xcite , who used a mean reddening correction for all the galaxies in their @xmath15 survey .",
    "we do note that our de - reddened luminosity function displayed in the right - hand panel of figure  [ lf ] is almost certainly an underestimate . while one can count the observed number of galaxies in some interval about a de - reddened luminosity @xmath124",
    ", there is always the possibility that some additional galaxies which belong in the interval are extincted below the flux limit of the survey .",
    "obviously , the problem becomes more serious at fainter magnitudes , but at higher redshifts , even relatively bright galaxies may be missing from the data .",
    "to examine the possible importance of this effect , we can use the mpa - jhu spectrum measurements of galaxies in the sdss data release  7 .",
    "this catalog contains the line fluxes and balmer - line extinction estimates for several hundred thousand galaxies in the nearby universe , allowing us to examine the distribution of [ o  ii ] extinctions as a function of intrinsic [ o  ii ] luminosity .",
    "these data illustrate a smooth trend in both the mean extinction of a population and the dispersion about this mean .",
    "for example , for systems with [ o  ii ] luminosities of @xmath125  ergs  s@xmath30 , the mean extinction is @xmath126 with a dispersion of @xmath127 about this mean . by @xmath128 ) \\sim 10^{43}$ ]  ergs  s@xmath30 however , @xmath129 has increased to @xmath130 and the dispersion has increased to @xmath131 .",
    "if this relation holds through @xmath8 , then , at any luminosity and distance , we could , at least in theory , compute the fraction of galaxies that should be extinguished below our completeness limit , and include that as an additional factor in the computation of the modified luminosity function @xmath101 .",
    "unfortunately , the current sample of galaxies is not extensive enough to apply this analysis technique or test the validity of our assumptions about extinction . to study galaxies beyond the knee of the @xmath132 [ o  ii ] @xmath2 luminosity function",
    ", one must reach intrinsic [ o  ii ] luminosities of @xmath133  ergs  s@xmath30 .",
    "such objects have a mean internal extinction of @xmath134 , but with a dispersion of @xmath135 about this mean .",
    "consequently , in order to keep the incompleteness corrections below @xmath136 , one must reach observed [ o  ii ] luminosities of @xmath137  ergs  s@xmath30 , and exclude detections within @xmath18  dex of the frame limit . at redshifts",
    "@xmath138 , our current data do not have a sufficient number of galaxies to satisfy this criteria .",
    "the full hetdex survey will certainly be able to investigate this question .",
    "for individual galaxies , the relationship between [ o  ii ] luminosity and star formation rate is complicated , since it depends on variables such as extinction , metallicity , and excitation .",
    "however , relatively robust calibrations for galaxy ensembles do exist in the literature @xcite , and these can be used to translate our [ o  ii ] luminosity functions into star formation rate densities .",
    "as figure  [ sfr_comp ] illustrates , the @xcite relation ( without its second - order metallicity correction ) gives star formation rates that are reasonably consistent with measurements in the uv .",
    "this is the conversion we adopt for our study",
    ".    table  [ obs_table ] lists two estimates for the [ o  ii ] @xmath2 star formation rate density : one derived by extrapolating a faint - end slope of @xmath114 to infinity and applying a single mean extinction of @xmath139  mag to all galaxies @xcite , and a second using the same faint - end extrapolation , but with our individual extinction estimates .",
    "( our luminosity functions are sufficiently deep that this extrapolation only increases the observed sfrd by @xmath140 . ) in general , the sfrds derived from the individual reddening values are @xmath141  dex smaller than those inferred using a mean extinction",
    ". this should not be too surprising : while the latter method more accurately corrects for extinction at the bright end of the luminosity function , it most likely underestimates the function s faint - end slope , due to the contribution of galaxies whose internal extinction causes them to fall out of our sample .",
    "conversely , the application of a mean extinction likely overestimates the faint - end slope , since the @xmath68 correlates directly with line luminosity .",
    "a steepening of @xmath11 by just @xmath142 would move the two values into agreement .",
    "figure  [ sfrd ] compares our individually de - reddened sfrds to other emission - line based sfrds , using the calibrations of @xcite for h@xmath11 , @xcite for [ o  ii ] @xmath2 , and @xcite for [ o  iii ] @xmath83 .",
    "clearly , the diagram has quite a bit of scatter , in part due to the different assumptions investigators make about internal extinction .",
    "nevertheless , the well - known correlation between star formation rate density and redshift is easily seen , and our data agree with those of most other measurements of instantaneous star formation rate . at @xmath8 , our value of @xmath143  yr@xmath30  mpc@xmath144 is @xmath145  times greater than that seen in the local ( @xmath22 ) universe , yet a factor of @xmath146 below that inferred from [ o  ii ] observations at @xmath15 .",
    "our data populate the gap between the [ o  ii ] measurements in the local and high - redshift universe .",
    "we have used the sample of 284 [ o  ii]-selected galaxies from the hetdex pilot survey to explore evolution in star formation over the last @xmath3  gyr of cosmic time . by analyzing the distribution of hetdex line fluxes , we find that , over the redshift range @xmath25 , the observed [ o  ii ] luminosity function exhibits significant evolution , with @xmath112 fading by @xmath147  dex between @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ". however , this shift tells only part of the story . because the hetdex pilot survey was conducted in areas of the sky with large amounts of ancillary data , we used each galaxy s spectral energy distribution to estimate its internal reddening . by adopting these stellar @xmath68 measurements , and assuming @xmath148 @xcite",
    ", we were able to correct each galaxy s observed [ o  ii ] flux for internal extinction , and thereby obtain an estimate of its intrinsic [ o  ii ] luminosity .",
    "the resultant extinction - corrected luminosity function exhibits stronger evolution in @xmath112 than the observed function , with this characteristic luminosity fading by @xmath149  mag between @xmath8 and today .",
    "the difference between the observed and de - reddened functions is consistent with the expectation that galaxies with higher star formation rates have greater internal extinction .",
    "a similar evolutionary trend is seen in the strength of the [ o  ii ] line relative to the continuum .",
    "while the distribution of rest - frame [ o  ii ] equivalent width is insensitive to line - luminosity , it does depend strongly on redshift .",
    "specifically , there are many more high - equivalent width [ o  ii ] emitters at @xmath8 than there are today .",
    "if we exclude the weak line emitters (  those objects with rest - frame equivalent widths less than 5   ) and fit an exponential to the remainder of the distribution , then we find that the scale length of rest - frame equivalent widths decreases smoothly , from @xmath150    at @xmath48 to @xmath151    at @xmath22 .",
    "this reddening - independent measure of star formation confirms that the relative intensity of galactic starbursts has been decreasing over the last @xmath3  gyr .    by integrating our extinction - corrected [ o  ii ] luminosity functions and using the [ o  ii ] sfr calibration of @xcite",
    ", we derive the star formation rate density in four redshift bins .",
    "we find that the sfrd decreases linearly with time , changing by a factor of @xmath145 between @xmath8 and today .",
    "our data cover the gap between the [ o  ii ] observations of the local universe and those at @xmath15 , and are in excellent agreement with measurements based on the h@xmath11 and [ o  iii ] @xmath83 line .",
    "there remains a substantial amount of scatter in the sfrd diagram , but this is due in large part to differences in techniques and reddening assumptions .",
    "our analysis , which employs individual sed - based reddening estimates and spans the redshift range @xmath152 , removes some of these problems .",
    "the sample presented here highlights the power of the upcoming hetdex survey @xcite to open up the emission - line universe .",
    "hetdex will map out over 300  deg@xmath1 of sky with a blind , integral - field spectroscopic survey .",
    "while the main goal of the project is to measure the power spectrum of @xmath153 ly@xmath11 emitting galaxies between @xmath154 and measure the evolution of the dark energy equation of state , the survey will also identify @xmath72 @xmath155 [ o  ii ] emitters .",
    "this unprecedented large sample of emission - line galaxies will cover the entire range of galactic environments and allow us to trace the evolution of star formation in field galaxies and clusters over the last @xmath3 gyr of cosmic time .",
