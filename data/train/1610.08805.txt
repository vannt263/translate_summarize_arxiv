    "for an ordinal three - category classification problem , the assessment of the performance of a diagnostic test is achieved by the analysis of the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) surface , which generalizes the roc curve for binary diagnostic outcomes .",
    "the volume under the roc surface ( vus ) is a summary index , usually employed for measuring the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test . under correct ordering",
    ", values of vus vary from 1/6 , suggesting the test is no better than chance alone , to 1 , which implies a perfect test , i.e. a test that perfectly discriminates among the three categories .",
    "the theoretical construction of the roc surface and vus was introduced for the first time by @xcite .    in medical studies , the evaluation of the discriminatory ability of a diagnostic test",
    "is typically obtained by making inference about its roc surface and vus , based on data from some suitable sample of patients ( or units ) .",
    "when the disease status of each patient can be exactly assessed by means of a gold standard ( gs ) test , a set of methods exist to estimate the roc surface and vus of the test in evaluation .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others . in practice , however , disease status verification via gs test could be unavailable for all units in the sample , due to the expensiveness and/or invasiveness of the gs test .",
    "thus , often , only a subset of patients undergoes disease verification . in such situations , the implementation of the methods discussed in the above mentioned papers",
    "could only be performed on the verified subjects , typically yielding biased estimates of roc surface and vus .",
    "this bias is known as verification bias .    in order to correct for verification bias",
    ", the researchers often assume that the selection for disease verification does not depend on the disease status , given the test results and other observed covariates , i.e. , they assume that the true disease status , when missing , is missing at random ( mar , @xcite ) . under this assumption , there exist few methods to get bias  corrected inference in roc surface analysis .",
    "@xcite proposed a nonparametric likelihood  based approach to obtain bias  corrected estimators for roc surface and vus of an ordinal diagnostic test . in case of continuous diagnostic tests",
    ", @xcite discussed several solutions based on imputation and re  weighting methods , and proposed four verification bias  corrected estimators of the roc surface and vus : full imputation ( fi ) , mean score imputation ( msi ) , inverse probability weighting ( ipw ) and semi  parametric efficient ( spe ) estimators .",
    "however , in some studies the decision to send a subject to verification may be directly based on the presumed subject s disease status , or , more generally , the selection mechanism may depend on some unobserved covariates related to disease ; in these cases , the mar assumption does not hold and the missing data mechanism is called nonignorable ( ni ) .    for two - class problems , methods to deal with ni verification bias have been developed , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "however , the issue of correcting for ni verification bias in roc surface analysis is very scarcely considered in the statistical literature .",
    "this motivated us to develop bias  corrected methods for continuous diagnostic tests with three  class disease status , under a ni missing data mechanism .",
    "in particular , in this paper we adopt parametric regression models for the disease and the verification processes , extending the selection model of @xcite to match the case of three  class disease status",
    ". then , we use likelihood - based estimators of model parameters to derive four estimators of the vus .",
    "consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators are proved .",
    "estimation of their variance is also discussed .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we set the working model and discuss its identifiability .",
    "in section 3 we present our proposed bias - corrected vus estimators , along with theoretical results about consistency and asymptotic normality .",
    "moreover , variance estimation is also addressed .",
    "the results of a simulation study are presented in section 4 .",
    "concluding remarks are left to section 5 .",
    "suppose we need to evaluate the predictive ability of a new continuous diagnostic test in a context where the disease status of a patient can be described by three ordered categories , `` non  diseased '' , `` intermediate '' and `` diseased '' , say .",
    "consider a sample of @xmath0 subjects and let @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the test result , the disease status and a vector of covariates for each subject , respectively . in this framework ,",
    "@xmath2 can be modeled as a trinomial random vector @xmath4 , such that @xmath5 is a bernoulli random variable having mean @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "hence , @xmath8 represents the probability that a generic subject , classified according to its disease status , belong to the class @xmath9 .",
    "we are interested in estimating the vus of the test @xmath1 , say @xmath10 , which is defined as ( @xcite ) @xmath11 or , equivalently , @xmath12 where the indices @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 refer to three different subjects , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the indicator function . when the disease status @xmath2 is available for all subjects , a natural nonparametric estimator of @xmath10 is given by @xmath18 however , in many situations not all subjects undergo the verification process , and hence , the disease status @xmath2 is missing in a subset of patients in the study .",
    "let @xmath19 be the verification status for the @xmath13-th subject : @xmath20 if @xmath21 is observed and @xmath22 otherwise .",
    "we define the observed data as the set @xmath23 ,  @xmath24 .",
    "when the true disease status is subject to ni missingness , estimators working under the mar assumption can not be applied tout court .",
    "our goal is to adjust fi , msi , ipw and spe estimators discussed in @xcite to the framework of ni missingness .      to deal with ni missing data mechanism , in what follows we extend parametric models adopted in @xcite for the two  class problem to the three  class case .",
    "more precisely , with three disease categories , we fix the model for the verification process as follows @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined in the previous section , @xmath28 is , in general , an arbitrary working function , and @xmath29 is a set of parameters . here , @xmath30 is the non - ignorable parameter : the missing data mechanism is mar if @xmath31 ; ni , otherwise . as for the disease model ,",
    "we employ the multinomial logistic regression for the whole sample , i.e. , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an arbitrary working function , and @xmath34 is a set of parameters , for @xmath35 . the parameters @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , can be estimated jointly by using a likelihood  based approach .",
    "it is worth noting that , under ( [ veri : model:2 ] ) , an application of bayes rule gives that @xmath38 therefore , @xmath39 so that , according to ( [ inter : lambda_1 ] ) and ( [ inter : lambda_2 ] ) , @xmath40 and @xmath41 can also be interpreted as log - odds ratios of belonging to class 1 ( instead of class 3 ) and to class 2 ( instead of class 3 ) , respectively , for a verified subject compared to an unverified subject with the same test result and covariates .      as in @xcite , in our model , for simplicity , we take @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which is a natural choice in practice . for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath3 , the observed distribution",
    "is fully determined by the three probabilities @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath47 similarly , we have that @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "then , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it follows that the log - likelihood function can be written as : @xmath53 the estimates @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 can be obtained by maximizing @xmath57 or by solving the score equations @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "the above equations are obtained by using the following results @xmath60 ( here @xmath61 is a pair in the set @xmath62 ) , and @xmath63 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau^\\top_{\\rho_2 } } \\rho_{2i } & = u_i\\rho_{2i}(1-\\rho_{2i } ) ; & \\qquad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau^\\top_{\\rho_1 } } \\rho_{2i } & = - u_i \\rho_{1i}\\rho_{2i}. \\end{array } \\nonumber \\ ] ]      in this section , we verify that the working model based on ( [ veri : model:2 ] ) , with @xmath42 , and ( [ dise : model ] ) , with @xmath43 , is identifiable . since the log  likelihood ( [ lg - like ] ) is fully determined by the three probabilities @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we have to show that such probabilities are uniquely determined by the parameters for all possible @xmath1 and @xmath3 . for the sake of simplicity , in the remainder of this section",
    "the auxiliary covariate @xmath3 is omitted ( actually , we can always view @xmath3 as fixed while varying @xmath1 ) .",
    "let @xmath64 be the set of parameters . for given @xmath65 ,",
    "we can write @xmath66 let @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for each @xmath70 .",
    "the above expressions , which refer to the quantities characterizing the the log  likelihood function ( [ lg - like ] ) , can be rewritten as @xmath71 now , assume that there are two distinct points @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) in the parameter space , such that the following equations ( with obvious notation ) hold : @xmath75 for all @xmath70 . by using ( [ iden : rho3 ] ) , the equations ( [ iden : rho1 ] ) and ( [ iden : rho2 ] ) are equivalent to @xmath76 respectively . in ( [ exper : rho1 ] ) and ( [ exper : rho2 ] ) the left hand sides are straight lines .",
    "thus , in order to ( [ exper : rho1 ] ) and ( [ exper : rho2 ] ) hold for all @xmath77 , the right hand sides must be constants . if these constants were 0 (",
    "because @xmath78 ) , then ( [ iden : rho3 ] ) would no longer hold for @xmath74 and all @xmath77 . alternatively , the right hand sides of ( [ exper : rho1 ] ) and ( [ exper : rho2 ] ) are non - zero constants if @xmath79 .",
    "then , as a consequence , ( [ iden : rho3 ] ) still is valid , for @xmath74 and all @xmath77 , eventually if @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this allows us to state that : if @xmath82 , with @xmath83 , then the considered model",
    "( with the particular choice for the functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) is identifiable , i.e. , the joint probabilities @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are determined by a unique set of parameters . of course , this claim can be easily extended to handle the presence of a covariate vector , @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath89 , for @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "it is easy to see , for instance , that @xmath92 hence , we can get , in particular , @xmath93 clearly , we also may consider quantities as @xmath94 then , we observe that @xmath95 similarly , we have @xmath96 so that ( [ org : vus ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath97 equation ( [ org : vus2 ] ) suggests how to build estimators of vus when some disease labels are missing in the sample : we can use suitable estimates @xmath98 to replace the @xmath99 s in ( [ nonp : vus ] ) .",
    "therefore , a fi estimator of vus is simply @xmath100 where @xmath98 ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the estimated disease probabilities obtained from the disease model ( [ dise : model ] ) .    since @xmath103=\\rho_{ki}$ ] , an alternative fi estimator of vus could be obtained by replacing @xmath99 s in ( [ nonp : vus ] ) with the estimates @xmath104 .",
    "unlike fi approach , msi estimator only replace the disease status @xmath99 by the estimate @xmath105 for unverified subjects .",
    "define @xmath106 and let @xmath107 be the estimated version with @xmath108 replaced by @xmath105 , and @xmath109 here , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "such estimates are derived from the verification model ( [ veri : model:2 ] ) .",
    "then , the msi estimator of vus is @xmath113    in the ipw approach , instead , each observation in the subset of verified units is weighted by the inverse of the probability that the unit was selected for verification .",
    "thus , the ipw estimator of vus is @xmath114 clearly , the estimates @xmath115 also arise from the selection model ( [ veri : model:2 ] ) .",
    "the last estimator is the pseudo doubly robust ( pdr ) estimator .",
    "we define @xmath116 an estimated version , @xmath117 , is obtained by entering the estimates @xmath115 and @xmath105 in the expression above .",
    "then , the pdr estimator of vus is @xmath118 the pdr estimator has the same nature as the spe estimator discussed in @xcite under mar assumption .",
    "however , under ni missing data mechanism it no longer has the doubly robust property .",
    "in fact , correct specification of both the verification model and the disease model is required for the pdr estimator to be consistent .",
    "note that all vus estimators basically require maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters @xmath119 , @xmath29 and @xmath120 of the working models ( [ veri : model:2 ] ) and ( [ dise : model ] ) .",
    "let @xmath121 be the nuisance parameter .",
    "observe that the proposed vus estimators can be found as solutions of appropriate estimating equations ( solved along with the score equations ) .",

    "recall that the nuisance parameter @xmath72 is estimated by maximizing the log  likelihood function ( [ lg - like ] ) .",
