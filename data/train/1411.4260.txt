    "majorana fermions , defined as fermions equivalent to own antiparticles , have been being hunted by high energy physicists for a long time.@xcite recent years , the search of majorana fermions has been shifted to solid - state systems , such as in the fractional quantum hall system and @xmath4-wave superconductors.@xcite in particular , the majorana bound states ( mbss ) are predicted to appear at two ends of a semiconductor nanowire , in the proximity of an @xmath5-wave superconductor and under a proper magnetic field.@xcite the signatures for possible formation of a spatially separated pair of mbss were reported in several experiments.@xcite two well - separated mbss can define a nonlocal fermion level and its occupation encodes a qubit.@xcite this nonlocal topological qubit is immune to local perturbation and thus , has potential application in quantum information .",
