    "the establishment of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) has greatly increased the necessity of detailed theoretical studies of the neutrino - deuteron ( @xmath0 ) reactions@xcite . at sno",
    ", neutrino oscillations can be directly tested by measuring the solar electron - neutrino flux using the charged - current ( cc ) reaction ( @xmath2 ) and the total solar neutrino flux using the neutral - current ( nc ) reaction , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the recent sno results@xcite have given definitive evidence for neutrino oscillations .",
    "to make the best use of the existing and future sno data , it is highly desirable to further improve the theoretical estimates of the @xmath0 cross sections .",
    "a traditional approach for describing nuclear electroweak processes consists in evaluating the contributions of 1-body impulse - approximation ( ia ) operators and 2-body exchange - current ( exc ) operators defined in the hilbert space of non - relativistic nuclear wave functions , with the exc terms derived from one - boson exchange diagrams .",
    "we refer to this approach as snpa ( standard nuclear physics approach ) .",
    "the calculations of the @xmath0 cross sections ( )  based on snpa have been done by several authors @xcite ; the most recent work due to nakamura _ et al . _",
    "shall be referred to as nsgk @xcite and netal @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach , effective field theory ( eft ) , has been applied to the @xmath0 reaction by butler _",
    "et al._(bck)@xcite .",
    "the eft lagrangian used by bck involves one unknown low - energy constant ( lec ) , @xmath5 , which bck adjusted to optimize fit to the  of nsgk .",
    "after this fine - tuning , the results of bck were found to agree with those of nsgk within 1% over the entire solar - neutrino energy region .",
    "very recently , ando _",
    "et al . _ have performed an eft - motivated calculation of  @xcite using a method called eft * ; in this approach , originally proposed by park et al.@xcite , the electroweak transition operators are derived with a cut - off scheme eft , while the initial and final nuclear wave functions are obtained with the use of a realistic phenomenological @xmath6 potential .",
    "the eft * lagrangian contains an unknown lec , denoted by @xmath7 , which plays a role similar to @xmath5 in bck . in eft",
    "* , however , @xmath7 can be determined directly from the tritium @xmath8-decay rate 3h , which allows a parameter - free calculation of the @xmath0 cross sections .",
    "we give here a concise account of the latest snpa calculation of the @xmath0 reaction carried out in netal @xcite .",
    "the main points of improvement over nsgk are as follows .",
    "first , the updated value of the axial coupling constant @xmath9 is used .",
    "secondly , the treatment of the axial - vector exchange current ( ) is improved .",
    "since the @xmath0 reaction in the solar - neutrino energy region is dominated by the gamow - teller ( gt ) transition ,   is a crucial ingredient that controls the accuracy of calculated cross sections . among the various terms in",
    ", the @xmath10-excitation current is the most important one .",
    "netal uses the @xmath10-excitation current determined in ref .",
    "@xcite to reproduce the experimental value of 3h .",
    "thirdly , netal employs the effective fermi coupling constant @xmath11 that includes inner - radiative corrections instead of @xmath12 used in nsgk .",

    "the hadron current is the sum of the vector ( @xmath22 ) and the axial current ( @xmath23 ) ; @xmath24 for the cc reaction and @xmath25 for the nc reaction . here",
    "@xmath26 is the weinberg angle .",
    "the hadron current consists of the 1-body ia current and the 2-body exc , whose explicit forms can be found in ref .  [ 1 ] .",

    "netal used the deuteron and the @xmath6 scattering wave functions generated with the anlv18 potential @xcite .",
    "the calculated total cross section for the cc reaction ( )  is shown in fig.[fig_tot ] as a function of the incident neutrino energy ( @xmath27 ) . although the cross section is dominated by the gt transition leading to the final @xmath28 @xmath6 state , the transitions leading to higher partial waves are not totally negligible",
    "; they account for 1% and 4% of the reaction rate at @xmath29 mev and @xmath30 mev , respectively .",

    "the strength of   was determined by analyzing the @xmath31 reaction and assuming a quark - model relation between the axial vector and vector coupling constants for the @xmath32 transition .",
    "we note , however , that 3h should give a much more direct constraint on   than @xmath33 , the latter being governed by the vector current .",
    "one way to gauge the sensitivity of   to different choices of   is to normalize the strength of  near threshold to reproduce . with this normalization applied ,",
    "the difference between the two exc models is reduced to 0.2% ; see the fourth column in table 1 .",
    "thus it is the overall strength of   that controls the low - energy @xmath0 reactions ;  is insensitive to the detailed structure of   once exc is adjusted to reproduce 3h .",
    "comparison with an eft * calculation @xcite provides a further test of the reliability of  obtained in netal .",
    "it is sufficient to make this comparison for the reaction rate leading to the final @xmath34 state .",
    "table [ tab_eft ] shows the ratio ( eft*)/(snpa ) , from which we can conclude that snpa and eft * give identical results within 1% accuracy .",

    "the radiative corrections are expected to affect   at the level of a few per cent .",
    "netal only took into account a part of the radiative correction incorporated into @xmath11 ; the most recent estimation of the remaining radiative corrections can be found in ref .",

    "a new experimental value of @xmath9 has been presented at this conference by abele @xcite .",
    "the reported value , @xmath9=1.274 , is significantly larger than the current pdg value used by netal .",
    "we remark , however , that if the calculation of netal is repeated with the use of this new value of @xmath9 , the resulting s would be essentially unchanged .",
    "since the strength of   in netal is determined to reproduce 3h , an increase in @xmath9 is largely compensated by a decrease in , leaving s essentially unaffected ."
