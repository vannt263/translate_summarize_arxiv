    "typically they show highly elongated morphologies , radio spectra relatively constant along the length of the relic , but steepening across the width , and high linear polarization @xcite .",
    "moreover , they have integrated radio spectra with power - law form at low frequencies , but that steepen above ghz frequencies @xcite .",

    "three of the troublesome issues are : ( 1 ) low dsa efficiencies predicted for electrons injected _ in situ _ and accelerated at weak , @xmath9 , shocks that are expected to form in merging clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "so , actively merging clusters are expected to contain several shocks , and we might actually expect multiple radio relics in typical systems . some of these difficulties could be accounted for in a scenario in which a shock may light up as a radio relic only when it encounters a pre - existing cloud of fossil relativistic electrons in the icm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    ", we focus on issue ( 2 ) above .",
    "to set up what follows , we note that in the test - particle dsa model for a _ steady , planar _ shock , non - thermal electrons that are injected _ in situ _ and accelerated at a shock of sonic mach number @xmath13 form a power - law momentum distribution , @xmath14 with @xmath15 @xcite . based on this result and the relation @xmath16 between @xmath17 and the synchrotron spectral index at the shock , @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 ) , the mach number of the hypothesized relic - generating shock is then commonly inferred from its radio spectral index using the relation , @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    ", the shock mach number can be also estimated from the temperature discontinuity obtained from x - ray observations , using the shock jump condition , @xmath21 , where the subscripts , `` @xmath22 '' and `` @xmath23 '' , identify the upstream and downstream states , respectively . sometimes , if the temperature jump is poorly constrained , @xmath24 is assessed from an estimate of the density jump , @xmath25 .",
    "although the radio and x - ray shock measures can agree , sometimes the synchrotron index , @xmath18 , implies a significantly higher mach number , @xmath26 , than @xmath24 .    without subsequent , downstream acceleration , the effects of synchrotron and inverse compton ( ic ) `` cooling '' ( @xmath27 )",
    "will truncate the postshock electron spectrum above energies that drop with increasing distance from the shock , since cooling times for @xmath28 gev electrons under cluster conditions are generally @xmath29 myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that is the standard explanation for observed spectral steepening across the width of the relic ( downstream of the shock ) . for reference",
    ", we note that if the shock is steady and planar , and the postshock magnetic field uniform , this energy loss prescription translates into an integrated synchrotron spectral index , @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the spectral index along the northern , `` leading '' edge of the head portion ( b1 ) of the so - called toothbrush relic in the merging cluster 1rxs j060303.3 at @xmath31 is estimated to be @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) with the corresponding radio mach number , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "but the gas density jump along the same edge in b1 inferred from x - ray observations implies a much weaker shock with @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the associated radio index , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) , is much too steep to account for the observed radio spectrum .    toward understanding",
    "this discrepancy between @xmath26 and @xmath24 for the toothbrush relic , we here consider the following two scenarios for modeling the radio observations of this relic : ( 1 ) _ weak - shock _ models ( @xmath36 ) with flat - spectrum , pre - existing cosmic - ray elections ( cre ) , and ( 2 ) _ strong - shock _ models ( @xmath37 ) with low - energy seed cre . in the _ weak - shock _ models ,",
    "we adopt a preshock , pre - existing population of cre with the right power - law slope , e.g. , @xmath38 $ ] with @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is an effective cutoff to the spectrum . in the _ strong - shock _ models , on the other hand , @xmath41 is chosen to match the observed radio spectral index , and low - energy seed cre ( @xmath42 ) are assumed to come from either the supra - thermal tail population generated at the shock or a pre - existing fossil population .    in the weak - shock models ,",
    "the value for @xmath43 is critical , since the observed emissions at frequencies @xmath44 mhz generally come from electrons with 10 gev or higher energies ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "so , if @xmath46 , the pre - existing electron population provides just `` low - energy seed electrons '' to the dsa process , which for @xmath47 would still lead to @xmath48 , and can not produce the observed radio spectrum with @xmath32 . hence , the weak - shock models with @xmath36 can reproduce the observed spectral index profile of the toothbrush relic only with @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "consequently , in order to explain the fact that @xmath50 for the toothbrush or similar relics by the weak - shock models , one should adopt a potentially radio - luminous , pre - existing electron population with @xmath51 .",
    "pre - shock radio emission might be observable in this case , of course , unless the shock has already swept through the region containing fossil electrons , so no preshock electrons remain .",
    "such a requirement for large @xmath43 , however , poses a question about the origin of these pre - existing cre , since the electrons with @xmath52 in a @xmath53 field cools on a brief time scale of @xmath54 myr . in the b1 portion of the toothbrush relic , the spectral index",
    "is observed to be uniform over 400 kpc along its leading edge .",
    "this means that in the weak - shock models , the length scale of the preshock region containing pre - existing cre with a uniformly flat spectrum with large @xmath43 should be as long as 400 kpc , tangential to the shock surface . moreover , since the shock compression ratio is @xmath55 for @xmath56 , while the observed radio width of the head is at least @xmath57 kpc , the width of this uniform preshock region should be @xmath58 kpc along the shock normal direction .",
    "considering the short cooling times for high energy electrons , it should be difficult to explain the origin of such a uniform cloud of pre - existing cre by fossil cre that were deposited in the past by an agn jet , for instance , unless the effective electron dispersion speed across the preshock structure was @xmath59c , or there was a uniformly effective turbulent acceleration in effect across that volume .    in the strong - shock models with @xmath37 ,",
    "on the other hand , the challenge to account for the uniform spectrum at the relic edge becomes less severe , since the models require only low - energy seed cre ( @xmath42 ) that could be provided by either the shock - generated supra - thermal electrons or pre - existing fossil cre ( @xmath60 ) with long cooling times ( @xmath61  gyr ) . in the latter case",
    ", the additional requirement for low - energy pre - existing cre to enhance the radio emission may explain why only a fraction of merger shocks can produce radio relics .",
    "such low - energy cre may originate from previous episodes of shock / turbulence acceleration or agn jets in the icm .    according to simulations for the large - scale structure formation of the universe ,",
    "the surfaces of merger - driven shocks responsible for radio relics are expected to consist of multiple shocks with different @xmath13 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from mock , x - ray and radio observations of relic shocks in numerically simulated clusters",
    ", @xcite showed that the shock mach numbers inferred from x - ray temperature discontinuity tend to be lower than those from radio spectral indices .",
    "this is because x - ray observations pick up the part of shocks with higher shock energy flux but lower @xmath13 , while radio emissions come preferentially from the part with higher @xmath13 and so higher electron acceleration . in the strong - shock models , we assume that the b1 portion of the toothbrush relic represents a portion of shock surface with @xmath37 , extending over 400  kpc along the length of the relic .",
    "it is important to note that the transverse width across the b1 component of the toothbrush relic is about 2 times larger than that of , another well - studied radio relic , the so - callled sausage relic in ciza j2242.8 + 5301 .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) at 610 mhz , for example , is about 110 kpc for the toothbrush relic @xcite , while it is about 55 kpc for the sausage relic @xcite . for the high frequency radio emission from electrons with",

    "we will argue below that relic - producing merger shocks are more spherical in geometry than planar .",
    "note , then , that since the downstream flow speed in the shock rest frame increases behind a spherical shock , the advection length in a given time scale is somewhat longer than that estimated for a planar shock @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath66 depends on the postshock magnetic field strength , @xmath67 , as @xmath68 \\left({b_2 \\over 5 \\mug}\\right)^{1/2 } , \\label{qfactor}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath69 are expressed in units of @xmath70 g .",
    "@xmath66 evaluated , for instance , for @xmath31 peaks with @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "then , with @xmath73 , the maximum width at 610 mhz becomes @xmath74 kpc .",
    "being only about half the observed width of the b1 region of the toothbrush relic at this frequency , it seems too small to allow the width to be set by radiative cooling alone following acceleration at the shock surface .    to overcome such a mismatch",
    ", we here consider and include the process in which electrons are additionally accelerated stochastically by mhd / plasma turbulence behind the shock . along",
    "somewhat similar lines , @xcite recently suggested that radio spectra harder than predicted by the dsa in a weak shock could be explained if relativistic electrons are re - accelerated through resonant interactions with strong alfvnic turbulence developed downstream of the relic shock .",
    "however , on small scales alfvnic mhd turbulence is known to become highly anisotropic , so resonant scattering is weak and ineffective at particle acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , fast - mode , compressive turbulence remains isotropic down to dissipation scales , so has become favored in treatments of stochastic re - acceleration of electrons producing radio halos during cluster mergers @xcite . in our case",
    "we do not depend on turbulent re - acceleration to produce a flat electron spectrum at the shock , but rather explore its potential role as an effective mean in slowing energy loss downstream of the shock .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe our numerical simulations incorporating both dsa and stochastic , turbulent acceleration for shock - based models designed to explore this problem . in section 3 , our results are compared with the observations of the toothbrush relic .",

    "while the systematic spectral steepening suggests postshock electron cooling , these widths are much broader than the cooling length given in equation ( [ lwidth ] ) . in effect , the spectral steepening due to radiative cooling in the postshock region is inconsistent with the observed profiles of radio fluxes and spectral index in this region , unless the effect of cooling is somehow substantially reduced ( see section 3 ) .    in response",

    ", turbulent acceleration in an icm context can include non - resonant scattering off compressive hydrodynamical ( acoustic ) turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) as well as gyro - resonant scattering off alfvenic turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and landau ( aka cerenkov or `` transit time damping '' , ttd ) resonance off compressive mhd turbulence ( with accompanying micro - instabilities to maintain particle isotropy ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "fast - mode , compressive mhd turbulence should remain isotropic to dissipative scales , however .",
    "so , even though the magnetic energy in the waves of this mode will be relatively less , they can be much more effective accelerators .    on these grounds ,",
    "we adopt for our exploratory calculations a simple cre acceleration model based on ttd resonance with compressive , isotropic fast - mode mhd turbulence . assuming that in the medium @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the plasma thermal pressure and @xmath117 is the magnetic pressure",
    ", we can then roughly express the acceleration time , @xmath111 , as @xmath118 here , @xmath119 is the acoustic wave speed , @xmath120 is the total energy density in fast - mode turbulence ( mostly contained in compressive `` potential energy '' , but also including transverse magnetic fields essential for resonant scattering ) .",

    "note that shocks in crash are true discontinuities and tracked on sub - grid scales @xcite .",

    "the electron injection to the fermi i process from the thermal pool is thought to be very inefficient , since the momentum of thermal electrons ( @xmath150 ) is much smaller than @xmath144 .",

    "so the adopted models for @xmath144 and the @xmath156-distribution do not influence the main conclusions of this study .    the cutoff momentum in equation ( [ finj ] ) can be estimated from the condition that the dsa acceleration rate is equal to the synchrotron / ic loss rate : @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the shock speed and @xmath160 represents the effective magnetic field strength that accounts for both synchrotron and ic losses @xcite . for typical parameters with @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 ,",

    ", the first inflection point in the @xmath280 profile occurs at @xmath281 kpc for the shock radius @xmath282 mpc and @xmath283 , and the second inflection point occurs at @xmath284 kpc for @xmath285 .",
    "the third infection point at @xmath286 kpc occurs at the postshock advection length , @xmath287 , which corresponds to the width of the postshock spherical shell .",
    "note that the normalization factor for @xmath288 is arbitrary , but it is the same for all three models with @xmath289 ( upper left panel ) and for the three models with @xmath290 ( upper middle panel ) . but note that for the s2.0d model @xmath288 is reduced by a factor of 0.6 , compared to other three models .",
    "so , for example , the relative ratio of @xmath288 between w1.7an ( without turbulent acceleration ) and w1.7a ( with turbulent acceleration ) is meaningful . in the case of the s3.6 models ( upper right panel ) , on the other hand , the normalization factor is the same for s3.6an , s3.6a , s3.6c ( with only dsa injection of shock - generated supra - thermal electrons ) , but a different factor is used for s3.6b ( with pre - existing , seed cre ) , in order to plot the four models together in the same panel .",
    "the effects of postshock turbulent acceleration can be seen clearly in the spectral steepening of @xmath262 in the lower panels .",
    "as shown in figure 4 below , for instance , the s3.6an model ( black ) produces a `` too - steep '' spectral profile compared to observations , while the s3.6c model ( green ) without turbulence decay ( @xmath205 ) produces a `` too - flat '' spectral profile .    to compare to the observed radio flux density distribution , @xmath291 , the intensity , @xmath267 ,",

    "in that regard , the s3.6b model with pre - existing cre is favored over the s3.6a model .",
    "note that the synchrotron intensity scales with @xmath303 , while the downstream magnetic field strength in these models is chosen to be @xmath304 ( see table 1 ) in order to maximize the downstream cooling length given in equation ( [ lwidth ] ) .        in the upper panels ,",
    "different normalization factors are adopted for each model to obtain the best match with the observed flux level of @xmath302 roughly at the peak values near @xmath305  kpc .",
    "the same relative normalization factors are scaled for the higher frequency and applied to @xmath306 in the middle panels .",
    "the observed profile of @xmath302 indicates that the region of the toothbrush relic beyond @xmath307 kpc might be contaminated by a contribution from the radio halo .",
    "we find that for the w1.7 and w2.0 models , a pre - existing electron population with @xmath239 and @xmath279 is necessary to reproduce the observed spectral steepening profile across the relic width .",
    "moreover , the results demonstrate that the six models with turbulent acceleration ( w1.7a , b , w2.0a , b , and s3.6a , b ) can reproduce the observed profiles of @xmath308 and @xmath275 reasonably well , while , as noted previously , none of the models without turbulent acceleration ( black solid lines ) can reproduce the profile of @xmath262 .",
    "however , it is also important to realize that the models should not produce `` excess '' turbulent acceleration . in particular , also as noted previously , the w2.0d model ( green ) with @xmath309 myr and the s3.6c model ( green ) without turbulence decay produce `` too - flat '' profiles of @xmath262 .    at the time of observation , @xmath310 , in the s3.6 models , so @xmath311 , which is slightly flatter than the observed index of 0.8 at the leading edge of the toothbrush relic .",
    "this , we argue , is still consistent , because the observed radio flux profiles are blended by a finite telescope beam .",
    "we also considered a model ( not shown ) with @xmath312 with @xmath313 , so at the time of observation , @xmath33 ( @xmath314 ) .",
    "that model , however , produces a spectral index profile across the relic a bit too steep to be compatible with the observed profile .          in the case of",
    "pure _ in situ _",
    "injection without turbulent acceleration , the postshock momentum distribution function is basically the same as the dsa power - law spectrum given in equation ( [ finj ] ) except the increasingly lower exponential cutoff due to postshock radiative cooling .",
    "so the volume integrated cre energy spectrum , @xmath315 , is expected to have a broken power - law form , whose slope increases from @xmath17 to @xmath316 at the break momentum , @xmath317 . in the lower - right panel of figure 1 , for instance , we can see that the volume - integrated electron spectrum , @xmath318 , steepens gradually near @xmath319 in the s3.6an model ( without turbulent acceleration , green long - dashed line ) .    of course such a simple picture for the steepening does not apply to the w1.7 and w2.0 models with the dsa re - acceleration of pre - existing electrons , since the spectrum at the shock , @xmath168 , is a broken power - law that steepens from @xmath320 to @xmath321 above @xmath322 . in these models , @xmath323 depends on the assumed value of @xmath237 ( see the black , red , and blue lines in the lower - left and lower - middle panels of figure 1 ) as well as @xmath111 .",
    "the models without turbulent acceleration are also shown in green long - dashed lines for comparison .    in the s3.6a model in the lower - right panel of figure 1 ,",
    "the supra - thermal @xmath156-like population for @xmath324 provides seed electrons for the _ in situ _",
    "injection into dsa and subsequent turbulent acceleration in the postshock flow .",
    "in fact , this results in an excess , low energy cre population in the range @xmath325 for the models , compared to the s3.6an model , as shown in the figure .",
    "this low energy component depends on the details of kinetic plasma processes operating near the shock , which are not yet fully understood , and would not contribute much to the observed radio emission in the range of @xmath326 ghz .",
    "for the postshock magnetic field strength , @xmath327 , electrons with @xmath328 make the peak contribution in this observation frequency range .    from the spectral shape of @xmath323 , we expect that the ensuing volume - integrated radio spectrum , @xmath329 , should steepen gradually towards high frequencies .",
    "moreover , the form depends on @xmath43 and @xmath111 in the w1.7 and w2.0 models and on @xmath330 and @xmath111 in the s3.6 models .",
    "figure 5 shows the volume - integrated radio spectrum , @xmath331 , for the w1.7a , w2.0a , s3.6a and s3.6b models at three different shock ages to demonstrate how the spectrum evolves in time .",
    "for the models without turbulent acceleration ( w1.7an , w2.0an , s3.6an , and s3.6bn ) , the spectrum is shown only at the first epoch ( the green long - dashed lines ) . in each panel , the normalization factor for the vertical scale is chosen so that the simulated curves match the observation data around 2 ghz .",
    "for the models without turbulent acceleration , the normalization factor is 1.6 times larger than for the corresponding models with turbulent acceleration . note that the open squares ( except at 4.85 ghz and 8.35 ghz ) are data for the b1 component of the toothbrush relic in table a1 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the sum of b1 + b2 + b3 flux at 4.85 ghz and 8.35 ghz in their table 5 .",
    "considering that the average ratio of the @xmath332 fluxes near 2 ghz is about 0.71 according to table 3 and table a1 of @xcite , we lower the fluxes at 4.85 ghz and 8.35 ghz in the kierdorf s data by the same factor .",
    "@xcite showed that the sz decrement in the observed radio flux can be significant above 10 ghz for radio relics .",
    "we adopt their estimates for the sz contamination factor for the toothbrush relic given in their table 1 .",
    "then , the sz correction factors , @xmath333 , for the fluxes at 16 ghz and 30 ghz are about 1.1 and 1.8 , respectively .",
    "two black filled circles correspond to the flux levels so - corrected at the two highest frequencies .",
    "although the models without turbulent acceleration do not reproduce the observed profile of @xmath275 , as shown in figure 4 , the w1.7an and w2.0an models seem to fit observed @xmath334 better than the w1.7a and w2.0a models .",
    "so this exercise teaches us that it is important to test any model against several different observed properties . among the strong - shock models , s3.6a and s3.6b with turbulent acceleration",
    "seem to produce better fits to sz - uncorrected @xmath334 , while s3.6an and s3.6bn without turbulent acceleration give the spectra more consistent with sz - corrected @xmath334 . in all models considered here ,",
    "however , it seems challenging to explain the observed flux at 8.35 ghz .    in conclusion",
    ", adjustments of basic parameters can allow both of the weak - shock and strong - shock models to explain the observational data for the toothbrush b1 component reasonably well . in the weak - shock scenario ,",
    "as we argued in the introduction , however , it would be challenging to fulfill the requirement for a homogeneous , flat - spectrum pre - existing electron population over a region 400 kpc in length and @xmath335 kpc in width , which is needed to explain the observed uniformity in the spectral index along the length of the relic . if the pre - existing electrons cool by radiative and collisional losses non - uniformly , or if the preshock cre have a span in `` ages '' , both the cutoff energy and so the spectral index at the relic edge would be expected to vary along the relic length .",
    "to explore such effects , we compare in figure 6 the weak - shock models allowing different cutoff energies , @xmath336 . in order to reproduce the observed profiles of both @xmath262 and @xmath331 ,",
    "@xmath337 is required for w1.7 and w2.0 models .",
    "considering that the cooling times for electrons with @xmath338 in @xmath70 g fields is only @xmath339 myr , it would be very challenging to explain a constant @xmath237 within the required preshock region .    in the right panels of figure 6",
    ", the w2.0d model ( green long - dashed lines ) shows that the `` enhanced '' turbulent acceleration with @xmath309 myr would be too efficient to explain the observed profile of @xmath275 .",
    "the model produces too many low energy electrons with @xmath340 , compared to high energy electrons with @xmath341 .",
    "this implies that the path to a model consistent with the observations can not involve the adoption of smaller @xmath237 combined with more rapid turbulent acceleration ( smaller @xmath111 ) .",
    "our results indicate that the strong - shock model with @xmath37 and pre - existing seed cre is favored .",
    "that could mean that the observed x - ray and radio mach numbers represent different parts of a nonuniform shock surface ( see the discussion in the introduction ) .",
    "however , we should point out that the predicted @xmath334 for the s3.6a and s3.6b models deviate from the observed curvature at 30 ghz ( figure 5 ) .",
    "finally , as noted earlier , in order to explain the rareness of detected radio relics in merging clusters , radio relics might be generated preferentially when shocks encounter regions of pre - existing low - energy cre .",
    "in this study , we re - examine the merger - driven shock model for radio relics , in which relativistic electrons are accelerated via dsa at the periphery of galaxy clusters . to that end , we perform time - dependent , dsa simulations of one - dimensional , spherical shocks , and compare the results with observed features of the toothbrush relic reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition to dsa , energy losses by coulomb scattering , synchrotron emission , and ic scattering off the cmb radiation , and , _ significantly _ , turbulent acceleration by compressive mhd / plasma mode downstream of the shock are included in the simulations .",
    "considering apparently incompatible shock mach numbers from x - ray ( @xmath0 ) and radio ( @xmath1 ) observations of the toothbrush relic , two possible scenarios are considered ( see table 1 for details ) : ( 1 ) _ weak - shock _ models in which a pre - existing , flat - spectrum electron population with high cutoff energy is accelerated by a weak shock with @xmath342 , and ( 2 ) _ strong - shock _ models in which low - energy seed cre , either shock - generated , supra - thermal electrons or pre - existing , soft - spectrum electrons are accelerated by a strong shock with @xmath233 .      \\1 . in order to reproduce the broad profile of the spectral index behind the head ( component b1 ) of the toothbrush relic , turbulent acceleration with @xmath343 myr",
    "should be included to delay the spectral aging in the postshock region .",
    "this level of turbulent acceleration is strong , but plausible in icm postshock flows .",
    "\\2 . the strong - shock models with @xmath233 ,",
    "either with a @xmath156-like distribution of supra - thermal electrons ( the s3.6a model ) or with low - energy , pre - existing cre with @xmath344 ( the s3.6b model ) , are more feasible than the weak - shock models .",
    "these models could explain the observed uniform spectral index profile along the relic edge over 400 kpc in relic length ( component b1 ) .",
    "further , the s3.6b model may be preferred , because ( 1 ) it can reproduce the observed flux density with a small fraction ( @xmath345 ) of pre - existing cre , and ( 2 ) it can explain the low occurrence ( @xmath346 ) of giant radio relics among merging clusters , where otherwise `` suitable '' shocks are expected to be common .",
    "these low - energy fossil electrons could represent the leftovers either previously accelerated within the icm by shock / turbulence or ejected from agns into the icm , since their cooling times are long , @xmath347  gyr with @xmath348 for @xmath349 . the s3.6a model , in which @xmath203 supra - thermal distribution is adopted , the predicted flux density is about five times smaller than the observed level .    \\3 .",
    "for the weak - shock models with @xmath342 , a flat ( @xmath350 ) pre - existing electron population with seemingly unrealistically high energy cutoff ( @xmath337 ) is required to reproduce the observational data ( the w1.7a and w2.0a models ) .",
    "it would be challenging to generate and maintain such a flat - spectrum , pre - existing population with uniform value of @xmath237 over the upstream region of 400 kpc in length and @xmath335 kpc in width , since the cooling time is short , @xmath351 myr for electrons with @xmath352 in @xmath353-level magnetic field .",

    "<S> although many of the observed properties of giant radio relics detected in the outskirts of galaxy clusters can be explained by relativistic electrons accelerated at merger - driven shocks , significant puzzles remain . in the case of the so - called toothbrush relic , </S>",
    "<S> the shock mach number estimated from x - ray observations ( @xmath0 ) is substantially weaker than that inferred from the radio spectral index ( @xmath1 ) . toward understanding </S>",
    "<S> such a discrepancy , we here consider the following diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) models : ( 1 ) _ weak - shock models _ with @xmath2 and a pre - existing population of cosmic - ray electrons ( cre ) with flat energy spectrum , and ( 2 ) _ strong - shock models _ with @xmath3 and either shock - generated supra - thermal electrons or pre - existing fossil cre . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the synchrotron emission from the accelerated cre , following the time evolution of the electron dsa , and subsequent radiative cooling and postshock turbulent acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both models could reproduce reasonably well the observed integrated radio spectrum of the toothbrush relic , but the observed broad transverse profile requires the stochastic acceleration by downstream turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , to account for the almost uniform radio spectral index profile along the length of the relic , the weak - shock models require a preshock region over 400  kpc with uniform population of pre - existing cre with high cutoff energy ( @xmath4 gev ) . due to the short cooling time </S>",
    "<S> , it is challenging to explain the origin of such fossil electrons . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we suggest the strong - shock models with low - energy seed cre ( @xmath5  mev ) are preferred for the radio observations of this relic . </S>"
