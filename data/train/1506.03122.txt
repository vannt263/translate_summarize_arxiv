    "the rapid increase in travel demands has led to severe congestion problems in urban transportation networks @xcite .",
    "this congestion has many significant negative impacts to society , including lost productivity , wasted fuel , and the creation of environmental and health problems @xcite .",
    "one recommended strategy to alleviate urban traffic congestion is improving signal timings at intersections where the current technology is deficient @xcite .",
    "many control strategies have been proposed since one of the earliest attempts in @xcite , but most are developed for under - saturated conditions and are not applicable to over - saturated conditions @xcite . in order to develop effective control and management strategies for urban networks , a fundamental challenge is to understand the static and dynamic properties of traffic in signalized networks under both under- and over - saturated conditions and a variety of other factors , e.g. , demand patterns , signal settings , and route choice behaviors .    to evaluate the impact of changes ( e.g. , re - timing the signals ) on urban networks , one practical approach is via the macroscopic fundamental diagram ( mfd)@xcite . the mfd is a network - level flow - density relation , which was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown that mfd exists in urban networks @xcite and is related to many factors , such as spatial variability in congestion and density distributions @xcite , route choices @xcite , signal settings and turning movements @xcite , and loading and unloading processes @xcite .",
    "efforts also have been devoted to deriving or approximating the shape of mfds .",
    "earlier in @xcite , a two - fluid model was introduced to town traffic by splitting vehicles into two groups : moving and stopped vehicles .",
    "relations among flow , density , and speed were derived by assuming the average speed in an urban network is a function of the fraction of stopped vehicles at any given time . in @xcite ,",
    "variational theory was used to approximate the mfd for any multi - block , signal - controlled streets without turning movements .",
    "this method was later extended in @xcite to provide an exact solution . in @xcite ,",
    "the mfd was derived by averaging the link - based fundamental diagrams for all links with the same parameter settings . in @xcite ,",
    "a two - bin model was used to study the possible stationary states in a double - ring network , and multivaluedness was observed in the network flow - density relations .",
    "however , the aforementioned analytical studies have their limitations : route choice behaviors were not explicitly modeled in @xcite , while signal settings were not explicitly modeled in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the definition of stationary states in signalized networks has not been clearly defined .    in @xcite ,",
    "stationary states were analytically solved in an uninterrupted ( i.e. , unsignalized ) double - ring network within the framework of kinematic wave models .",
    "it was found that infinitely many stable states with zero - speed shock waves ( zs ) could arise at the same network density in the congested branch of mfds .",
    "simulations using the cell transmission model ( ctm ) @xcite of a signalized double ring network unveiled periodic traffic patterns and these were defined as stationary states . however , due to the infinite - dimensional state variables introduced by the kinematic wave model , traffic statics and dynamics are very difficult to solve when traffic signals are present . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the number of stationary states in a signalized double - ring network and their stability properties and relations to cycle lengths , retaining ratios , and initial densities are all still unclear .",
    "this study aims to fill this gap by studying a simple signalized intersection shown in figure [ fig : urban - network : intersection ] .",
    "if exiting vehicles in the downstream are immediately added into the network from their corresponding upstream entrances , the signalized intersection is further changed into a signalized double - ring network with periodic boundary conditions , which is shown in figure [ fig : urban - network : double - ring ] . in the signalized double - ring network ,",
    "traffic statics and dynamics are easier to solve because we only need to keep track of traffic states on the two rings .",
    "furthermore , instead of using the kinematic wave model in @xcite , we use a simplified approximation called the link queue model in @xcite to formulate the traffic dynamics in the signalized double - ring network . with the assumption of a triangular traffic flow fundamental diagram @xcite",
    ", the signalized double - ring network is studied as a switched affine system .",
    "the switching rule is governed by three sets of parameters : initial densities , route choice behaviors , and signal settings .",
    "periodic density evolution orbits are found and defined as stationary states .",
    "a poincar map approach @xcite is used to study the properties of such stationary states .",
    "poincar maps were originally used to study the movements of celestial bodies and are a very important tool in analyzing periodic orbits : each periodic orbit corresponds to a fixed point on the poincar map , and its stability is directly related to the stability of the fixed point . in @xcite , poincar maps have been applied to study the stability and bifurcation in traffic flow in diverge - merge and other networks within the framework of network kinematic wave theories . with short cycle lengths ,",
    "closed - form poincar maps are derived for signalized networks , and stationary states and the corresponding stabilities are obtained by solving and analyzing the fixed points on the poincar maps .",
    "the impacts of retaining ratios and initial densities on the mfds and the gridlock times are analyzed . with long cycle lengths ,",
    "closed - form poincar maps are hard to obtain , and thus , the corresponding fixed points are numerically solved using the secant method @xcite .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ a switched affine system for a signalized double - ring network ] , we formulate the traffic dynamics in a signalized double - ring network as a switched affine system when the link queue model @xcite and a triangular traffic flow fundamental diagram @xcite are used . in section [ periodic density evolution orbits and derivation of poincare maps ]",
    ", we derive the poincar maps from the density evolution orbits in the switched affine system . stationary states and their stability properties",

    "according to the link queue model ( lqm ) @xcite , vehicles in a link are treated as always being in a queue , and therefore , each link has only one state variable , the average link density .",
    "the left and the right rings in figure [ fig : urban - network : double - ring ] are denoted as rings 1 and 2 with average densities @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we assume both rings have the same length @xmath2 .",
    "since it is a closed network , we have @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the average network density .",

    "we assume the yellow and all red period in each phase is the same as the lost time , and therefore , the effective green time is @xmath18 for ring 1 and @xmath19 for ring 2 , and @xmath20",

    "the retaining ratio is denoted as @xmath28 for ring 1 and @xmath29 for ring 2 , which means the turning ratio is @xmath30 from ring 1 to ring 2 and @xmath31 from ring 2 to ring 1 .",

    "according to the traffic conservation in ring 1 , the following equation holds : @xmath37 with equations ( [ equ : demand : supply : double - ring ] ) to ( [ equ : link queue : double - ring ] ) , the system equation can be written as @xmath38 which is closely related to the average network density @xmath4 , the signal settings @xmath23 , and the route choice behaviors @xmath39 .",
    "note that equation ( [ equ : link queue : double - ring : system equation ] ) is a nonlinear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) with periodic forces .",
    "it is simpler than the kinematic wave model ( equation ( 3 ) in @xcite ) , which is a partial differential equation ( pde ) , but still quite challenging to solve .      for the remainder of this paper , we adopt the following triangular traffic flow fundamental diagram @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the free - flow speed and the shock - wave speed , respectively . then the signalized double - ring network can be further formulated as a switched affine system @xcite , and the traffic dynamics in equation ( [ equ : link queue : double - ring : system equation ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of possible combinations of @xmath45 .",

    "<S> understanding traffic statics and dynamics in urban networks is critical to develop effective control and management strategies . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a novel approach to study the traffic statics and dynamics in a signalized double - ring network , which can provide insights into the operation of more general signalized traffic networks . under the framework of the link queue model ( lqm ) and the assumption of a triangular traffic flow fundamental diagram , </S>",
    "<S> the signalized double - ring network is studied as a switched affine system . due to periodic signal regulations , </S>",
    "<S> periodic density evolution orbits are formed and defined as stationary states . </S>",
    "<S> a poincar map approach is introduced to analyze the properties of such stationary states . with short cycle lengths , </S>",
    "<S> closed - form poincar maps are derived . </S>",
    "<S> stationary states and their stability properties are obtained by finding and analyzing the fixed points on the poincar maps . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a stationary state can be asymptotically stable , lyapunov stable , or unstable . </S>",
    "<S> the impacts of retaining ratios and initial densities on the macroscopic fundamental diagrams ( mfds ) and the gridlock times are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> multivaluedness and gridlock phenomena as well as the unstable branch with non - zero average network flow - rates are observed on the mfds . with long cycle lengths , fixed points on the poincar maps </S>",
    "<S> are solved numerically , and the obtained stationary states and the mfds are very similar to those with short cycle lengths .    </S>",
    "<S> compared with earlier studies , this paper provides an analytical framework that can be used to provide complete and closed - form solutions to the statics and dynamics of double - ring networks . </S>",
    "<S> this can lead to a better understanding of how the combination of signalized intersections and turning maneuvers is expected to impact network properties , like the mfd .    </S>",
