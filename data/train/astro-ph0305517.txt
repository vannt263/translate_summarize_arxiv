    "this `` running '' of the spectral index modulates the relative amplitudes of density fluctuations on large to small scales .",
    "interestingly , the combined analysis of the first - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data , the 2df galaxy redshift survey , and lyman-@xmath11 forest observations favors a cosmological model with a `` running '' of the primordial power spectrum ( spergel et al .",

( 2003b ) studied early structure formation in a warm dark matter model and showed that suppressing the linear power even on very small scales @xmath20 mpc@xmath21 ) can considerably affect the formation of high redshift star - forming gas clouds , making early reionization by massive , metal - free stars unlikely to occur early on .",
    "chiu , fan & ostriker ( 2003 ) argue that a large optical depth @xmath22 may require exotic radiation sources other than a normal stellar population .",

    "overall , these theoretical studies suggest that , _ if _ the large thomson optical depth observed by the wmap satellite is confirmed , the standard power - law ( @xmath12 ) @xmath0cdm model is favored over other models with reduced small scale power . thus , the wmap results appear to suggest a somewhat contradictory cosmological model . since the major reason to favor power - law @xmath0cdm in this context is the inferred early epoch of reionization , it is clearly important to study and compare quantitatively details of the reionization process in the two cosmologies , the rsi model and a power law @xmath0cdm universe",
    ".    in the present paper , we study early structure formation in rsi and @xmath0cdm universes using cosmological @xmath23-body / hydrodynamic simulations . by combining these dynamical models with radiative transfer calculations ,",
    "we compute the epoch of reionization by various stellar sources in the two cosmologies and compare the thomson optical depth to that measured by the wmap satellite .    in particular , at high redshifts , @xmath24 , we consider the implications of an early population of massive , metal - free stars ( the `` first stars '' ) , which have been hypothesized to form in `` mini - halos '' ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we refer to the sites where these stars can form as `` primordial gas clouds ; '' i.e. dense regions of cold gas which accumulate through the action of cooling by molecular hydrogen . in order to identify these primordial gas clouds ,",
    "our simulations follow the non - equilibrium chemical reactions of a chemically pristine gas and molecular hydrogen cooling . in an earlier study ( yoshida et al .",
    "2003a ) , we found that non - equilibrium effects associated with dynamical heating play a critical role in regulating the supply of molecular gas , contrary to the assumptions commonly made in semi - analytic studies of this process .",
    "hence , it is necessary to follow the dynamics of structure formation explicitly to reliably estimate the abundance of early stars .",
    "it is also important to specify the source location accurately when carrying out radiative transfer caculations . unlike semi - analytic methods ,",
    "direct hydrodynamic simulations enable us to locate plausible star - forming sites robustly in a cosmological volume .",
    "as we discuss later in the present paper , the distribution of the sources strongly affects the overall topology of the ionized regions .",
    "we show that the reduced small scale power in the rsi model causes a considerable delay in the formation epoch of low mass halos and the primordial gas clouds within them compared to a @xmath0cdm counterpart . in view of this result",
    ", it appears unlikely that massive stars in mini - halos can contribute significantly to reionization in cosmologies with a running spectral index , at least for those with parameters similar to what is inferred from the joint wmapext + 2dfgrs + lyman-@xmath11 forest analysis ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) . to study the impact of ordinary ( `` population ii '' ) stars formed in galaxies and protogalaxies , we carry out ray tracing calculations of reionization by stellar sources .",
    "for an initial mass function ( imf ) similar to that in local galaxies , reionization can be completed at sufficiently early times to account for the lyman-@xmath11 optical depths measured in quasars at @xmath25 , but in the case of the rsi model only if a large fraction of ionizing photons are able to escape from galaxies .",
    "furthermore , because reionization occurs late in this context , the thomson optical depth is too small to be compatible with that suggested by the wmap measurements .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that the production rate of ionizing photons could be boosted in galaxies and protogalaxies with a top - heavy imf . in this case ,",
    "thomson optical depths approaching that favored by the wmap analysis are possible , but only if the parameters describing these stars are pushed to extreme values .",

    "we first describe the cosmological simulations we use to study the abundance of high - redshift star - forming systems in  2 .",
    "we present the simulation results in  3 . in  4 , we discuss the possible effect of the finite size of our simulation volume . in  5 , the abundance of primordial gas clouds and implications are described .",
    "there , we also give a brief description of the basic relation between reionization epoch and the total thomson optical depth . in ",
    "6 we show the results of radiative transfer calculations in which we consider ordinary stellar populations in galaxies and protogalaxies as radiation sources .",
    "a summary and discussion are given in  7 .",
    "we use the parallel tree - pm solver gadget2 combined with smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) in our simulations .",
    "our treatment of sph employs the conservative entropy formulation of springel & hernquist ( 2002 ) , which offers several distinct advantages over previous versions of sph . in particular , because the energy equation is written with the entropy as the independent thermodynamic variable , as opposed to the thermal energy , the @xmath26 term is not evaluated explicitly , reducing noise from smoothed estimates of e.g. the density . by including terms involving derivatives of the density with respect to the particle smoothing lengths",
    ", this approach explicitly conserves entropy ( in regions without shocks ) , even when smoothing lengths evolve adaptively , avoiding the problems noted by e.g. hernquist ( 1993 ) .",

    ". since the input power spectra are normalized at a length scale larger than the simulation boxsize , the amplitudes of the density fluctuations realized in the rsi simulation are smaller than in the @xmath0cdm simulation on all length scales .",
    "hence , the density fluctuations on large scales ( @xmath50 ) in the rsi model should evolve similarly to those in @xmath0cdm but with a slight delay in time .",

    "also , rich small - scale structure develops early on only in the @xmath0cdm model , as can be inferred from the linear power spectrum ( figure [ powspec ] ) .",
    "since the typical masses of the halos that host early primordial gas clouds are @xmath53 ( tegmark et al 1997 ; machacek et al .",
    "2001 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2003a ) , the abundance of such small mass halos is an important quantity to compare . in order to quantify the difference between the two models , we measure the mass function of dark matter halos . whereas locating dark halos in pure @xmath23-body simulations is relatively simple using conventional techniques such as the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm , there are a few subtleties in identifying and assigning properties to halos in @xmath23-body / hydrodynamic simulations . since our main objective is to compare the halo abundance between the two models , we avoid ambiguities by adopting a simple procedure , as follows .",
    "we locate halos by running a fof groupfinder with linking parameter @xmath54 on the dark matter particles in our simulations .",
    "we then assign the total mass to each group as the number of linked member particles multiplied by the scaled particle mass @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the dark matter particle mass and @xmath57 is the gas particle mass .",
    "we compute the press - schechter ( ps ) mass function to which we input the linear power spectrum for the dark matter component .",
    "( note that , for our simulations , separate transfer functions are used for the dark matter and gas components in setting - up the initial conditions [ for details , see yoshida , sugiyama & hernquist 2003 ] . )",
    "we compare the mass function of the halos identified in this manner at @xmath52 and @xmath51 in figure [ mfz17 ] and figure [ mfz7 ] , we use units that include the hubble constant @xmath58 , to be consistent with those commonly used ; @xmath59 for mass and @xmath60 for abundance . ] . for both models ,",
    "the measured mass function is overall well fitted by the ps mass function ( the solid line for the @xmath0cdm model and the dashed line for the rsi model ) .",
    "again , the rsi model at @xmath52 resembles the @xmath0cdm model at @xmath51 with the abundance of low - mass halos being appreciably small .",
    "the halo abundance in the rsi model appears to deviate slightly from the ps mass function .",
    "although a similar feature is also seen in the @xmath0cdm model , the deviation from the ps mass function is more clearly noticeable for the rsi model .",
    "we discuss this issue together with finite boxsize effects in the next section .",
    "it is well known that structure in cdm models grows hierarchically ; i.e. , smaller mass objects form earlier and merge to form bigger objects .",
    "while this can be easily inferred from the variance @xmath61 for the @xmath0cdm model , which has larger amplitudes on smaller length scales ( see figure [ powspec ] ) , the situation is less clear for the rsi model .",
    "as figure [ powspec ] shows , the variance in the rsi model appears approximately constant over a range of scales @xmath62 < 1000 $ ] , indicating that nonlinear objects with widely different masses could form nearly at the same epoch .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that it is not clear whether the press - schechter theory can be used for such models . for the comparison shown in figure [ mfz17 ] , we calculated the ps mass function by formally inputting the linear power spectrum for the rsi model .",
    "although the agreement shown in figure [ mfz17 ] is reasonably good , it is _ not _ trivially expected .",
    "the flatness of the variance of the rsi model deserves particular attention also for another reason ; the hierarchical nature of the formation of dark matter halos has a strong influence on the formation of primordial gas clouds ( yoshida et al .",
    "hence it is important to verify whether or not small mass ( @xmath1 ) nonlinear objects in the rsi model grow hierarchically early on . for this purpose",
    ", it is more appropriate to work with a properly defined mass variance rather than the power spectrum .",
    "+ we compute the mass variance as @xmath63 where the top - hat window function is given by @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ sigma ] shows @xmath65 for the two models . in the plotted range ,",
    "the mass variance in the rsi model monotonically increases toward smaller mass scales , indicating that less massive objects form at earlier epochs ; i.e. , structure formation is still expected to be `` bottom - up '' .",
    "note that the rsi model adopted in the present paper predicts an effective slope of the power spectrum smaller than -3 for @xmath66 .",
    "on very small length scales ( @xmath67 ) , or equivalently on low mass scales ( @xmath68 ) , structure formation should then proceed differently from the `` bottom - up '' picture . owing to the flattening of the variance",
    ", the characteristic mass scale of the first non - linear objects may not be well defined .",
    "halos with masses @xmath69 should collapse first and larger objects will be formed through mergers of these small halos .",
    "simulations with a substantially higher mass resolution are needed to reveal how halos with such very low masses form , although it will not be important for the formation of halos with masses @xmath1 that are crucial for primordial gas cloud formation .",
    "let us now examine the consequences of the finite box size of our simulations .",
    "we quantify the effect by computing an effective variance @xmath70 where we set the lower boundary @xmath71 to exclude the contribution from large - scale density fluctuations which are missing in our simulations .",
    "we simply set @xmath72 with @xmath73 being the simulation box sidelength .",
    "the thin lines in figure [ sigma ] are the effective mass variance computed in this manner .",
    "for both the models , @xmath74 is     + slightly smaller than @xmath75 on the relevant mass scales ( @xmath76 ) , and thus a systematic delay in the characteristic formation epoch ( or a slightly lower abundance at a given epoch ) is expected .",
    "this may account for the small discrepancy in the mass function plotted in figure [ mfz17 ] .",
    "since we use linearly extrapolated power spectra to compute @xmath65 and @xmath77 , the precise effect of a finite boxsize remains still uncertain . the apparent difference shown in figure [ sigma ]",
    "should be interpreted as _ qualitatively _ representing the finite boxsize effect .",
    "note that the rsi model is more affected by the finite boxsize because the relative fractional power on large scales is bigger than in the @xmath0cdm model ( see figure [ powspec ] ) .",
    "systematic studies using larger box simulations are clearly needed to address this issue further .    by constructing a halo merger history using 30 simulation outputs dumped",
    "frequently between @xmath78 , we also verified that almost all the halos that have masses greater than @xmath79 at @xmath52 grew monotonically in mass by repeated mergers and continuous accretion of smaller mass elements , quite similarly to what is found in the @xmath0cdm model at somewhat higher redshifts .",
    "as long as we are concerned with the abundance of low - mass halos , the results of our small box simulations appear to be in reasonable agreement with the press - schechter mass function . in figure [ nhalo ]",
    "we show the number of halos with masses greater than @xmath80 .",
    "we chose the threshold mass @xmath81 based on the results of yoshida et al .",
    "( 2003a ) for star - forming systems .",
    "although the incomplete sampling of the halo mass function owing to the finite boxsize is appreciable at high redshift , @xmath82 for the @xmath0cdm model and @xmath83 for the rsi model , overall the halo abundance is in agreement with the ps prediction .",
    "thus , we conclude that the statistics we discuss in the present paper , such as the abundance of primordial gas clouds , are not significantly affected by the finite simulation boxsize .",
    "the apparent discrepancy in figure [ nhalo ] may be partly due to some inaccuracies of the analytic mass function itself ( see jenkins et al .",
    "2001 ; reed et al . 2003 ) , although the simulation results of jang - condell & hernquist ( 2001 ) indicate that the ps mass function is a good approximation on these mass scales .",
    "an important point to note is that both the analytic estimate and the simulation results suggest that the number of of halos with mass @xmath84 , which are crucial for the primordial gas cloud formation , is an order of magnitude smaller in the rsi model .",
    "finally , we mention that a promising way of compensating for the missing large - scale power would be to employ the mode - adding procedure developed by tormen & bertschinger ( 1996 ) and by cole ( 1997 ) .",
    "the method can effectively extend the dynamic range of cosmological simulations , and thus will be useful for studies of early structure formation in a cosmological context .",
    "numerical simulations ( e.g. abel , bryan & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi & larson 2002 ) suggest that the first stars in the universe were unusually massive and formed in `` mini - halos '' at redshifts @xmath83 , as a consequence of cooling by molecular hydrogen .",
    "it is customary to refer to early , massive stars as population iii . in what follows",
    ", we will distinguish between massive stars which may have formed in mini - halos by molecular cooling ( the `` first stars '' ) from those which could have originated in larger halos where gas can cool by atomic processes .",
    "while the nature of the `` first stars '' has been studied in some detail , the stellar populations expected in slightly more massive halos ( the `` first galaxies '' ) is unclear . with modest uncertainty",
    ", we can quantify the importance of the former to reionization , but numerous assumptions are required to account for `` non - standard '' imfs in early protogalaxies , as we discuss later in the paper .",
    "owing to the delayed formation of `` mini - halos '' in the rsi model , the formation of primordial gas clouds is also expected to occur late .",
    "it is in these regions that significant quantities of molecular gas can accumulate , leading to the formation of massive , metal - free stars of the type modeled by e.g. abel , bryan & norman ( 2002 ) and bromm , coppi & larson ( 2002 ) .",

    "the number of stars formed in the primordial gas clouds is likely to be limited to one ( omukai & nishi 1999 ; oh et al .",
    "hence the number of `` first stars '' in the rsi model is far too small at @xmath2 to reionize the universe .",
    "the epoch of _ complete _ reionization is certainly much later than @xmath91 , implying a small total optical depth @xmath119 .    in summary ,",
    "primordial gas cloud formation which relies on molecular hydrogen cooling in low - mass , `` mini - halos '' appears to be extremely inefficient at @xmath2 in the rsi model and thus other sources , such as early protogalaxies , must contribute to reionization for this model to be compatible with the wmap results .",
    "furthermore , it is important to establish whether or not ordinary stellar sources in galaxies in the rsi model can account for reionization early enough to even be consistent with measurements of the lyman-@xmath11 optical depth in quasars at @xmath25 .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that low - mass mini - halos and primordial gas clouds which can harbor massive , metal free stars ( the `` first stars '' ) do not form in sufficient numbers at high redshift in the rsi model to account for reionization at @xmath24 .",
    "as we emphasize in  5.2 and figure 7 , reionization must occur early if the wmap measurement of the thomson optical depth is accurate .    the number of larger mass ( @xmath120 ) halos is also predicted to be small for the rsi model .",
    "thus , reionization by stars in systems that are the likely progenitors of galaxies will be less efficient than for a @xmath0cdm model , for similar assumptions about the stellar populations . in this section ,",
    "we study reionization by stars in galaxies and proto - galaxies with total masses larger than @xmath121 , where the gas can cool rapidly by atomic line transitions .",
    "the nature of the stars forming early in these environments is uncertain .",
    "it is possible , for example , that the imf will be top - heavy , at least initially , perhaps increasing the production rate of ionizing photons per unit stellar mass compared to a conventional imf inferred for stellar populations in the local universe .    in what follows ,",
    "we begin by considering star formation in halos in the rsi model by assuming that the stellar population is similar to that locally and is unevolving .",

    "first , we compute the `` generic '' star - formation rate for the rsi model using the analytic model of hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) .",
    "their approach describes the formation of dark matter halos using an analytic halo mass function ( sheth & tormen 1999 ; 2002 ) , and employs simplified prescriptions for the cooling of gas and star - formation which are commonly used in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( kauffmann et al .",
    "1999 ; springel et al . 2001 ; yoshida et al .",
    "this analytic formalism has been tested in detail by comparing its predictions to those from     + cosmological simulations that include hydrodynamics and star formation ( springel & hernquist 2003b ) .",
    "a thorough description of the model is given by hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) and references therein .",
    "in particular , hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) show that under rather general circumstances the star - formation rate density is well - approximated by the simple form @xmath123 where @xmath124 in equation ( [ hs_sfr ] ) , the factors @xmath125 and @xmath126 are fixed by the underlying cosmological power spectrum , the choices for @xmath127 and @xmath128 reflect the interplay between radiative cooling in halos and the expansion of the universe , and the normalizing constants @xmath129 and @xmath11 depend on the rate at which cold , dense gas is converted into stars .",
    "the form of equation ( [ hs_sfr ] ) is motivated by two competing effects which regulate star formation . at sufficiently high redshifts ,",
    "collapsed gas is dense and cooling times are short so that star formation is only limited by the gravitational growth of massive halos . at low redshifts , the cooling time in halos increases owing to the decline in the mean density of the universe by cosmic expansion . in this regime ,",
    "the supply of star - forming gas is throttled by the expansion of the universe .    based on the multiphase description of star - forming gas described by springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) , hernquist & springel ( 2003 )",
    "show that the appropriate values for the parameters in equation ( [ hs_sfr ] ) for the @xmath0cdm model employed here are @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135/yr / mpc@xmath118 .    for the rsi cosmology",
    ", we use the rsi linear power spectrum as input and follow the procedure described in hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) .",

    "we use the forms for the sfr density in our ray - tracing calculatiosn only within the restricted redshift range @xmath142 to compute radiation source luminosities .",
    "the second step is to prescribe the luminosity of the sources ( `` galaxies '' ) located in the simulations .",
    "specifically , we use the outputs from run q5 of springel & hernquist ( 2003b ) , which simulates a cube of 14.3 mpc on a side .",
    "we first calibrate the sfrs of individual sources identified in the simulation , and then convert these into luminosities .",
    "as in sokasian et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , we use the derived sfr ( equation [ hs_sfr ] ) as a reference to match the total sfr of the sources .",
    "we carry out the calibration procedure after selecting sources in the simulation outputs in the following two ways .      in this approach ,",
    "we identify all the halos found in each output as `` galaxies '' and assign luminosities to them based on the actual star - formation rates which are computed in a dynamically consistent way in the cosmological simulation .",
    "the minimum mass of the sources is set by the resolution of the simulation , which is @xmath143 in our case .",
    "the sfrs of the sources with masses close to the resolution limit are corrected in the same manner as in sokasian et al .",
    "( 2003a ,  4.2.1 ) .",
    "we then scale the sfrs of all the galaxies by multiplying by a constant factor @xmath144 such that the total sfr within the simulated volume matches that for the rsi model obtained from equation ( [ hs_sfr ] ) .",
    "note that the scaling factor @xmath145 is kept constant for all the galaxies within one simulation output , but it is time - dependent .",
    "since the halo abundance itself is lower in the rsi model than in the @xmath0cdm cosmology , it may be more appropriate to populate a smaller number of objects as radiation sources in the rsi model .",
    "motivated by this , we first compute the number density of halos with virial temperature greater than @xmath146 k in which the gas can cool by atomic line transitions .",
    "the threshold mass is given by @xmath147 then we use the halo mass function to compute the expected abundance of halos with mass greater than @xmath148 .",
    "let us denote this number by @xmath149 . in the simulation output produced at @xmath99 , we select @xmath149 halos in order of their mass .",
    "luminosities are assigned to the selected sources in proportion to their mass , @xmath150 such that the total sfr summed over the selected sources matches the global sfr given by equation ( [ hs_sfr ] ) , with the parameter values appropriate for the rsi model .",
    "finally , the ionizing flux from the sources is modulated by the `` escape fraction , '' @xmath151 , which describes the probability that individual photons can escape from the galaxy in which they were produced into the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "sokasian et al . (",
    "2003a ) studied reionization by stellar sources in the @xmath0cdm universe by adopting several values for @xmath151 .",
    "based on a detailed comparison with the observational results of the @xmath152 quasar ( sdss 1030.10 + 0524 ) in becker et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , they conclude that @xmath153 is most consistent with the observed lyman-@xmath11 flux transmittance .",
    "we take this @xmath153 model in sokasian et al .",
    "( 2003a ) as our fiducial case for the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "for the rsi model , our zeroth order requirement is that reionization should be completed by @xmath154 .",
    "after several experiments , we found that setting @xmath155 is necessary for the rsi model to satisfy this condition .",
    "we thus set @xmath156 as our basic choice for the rsi model and compare the results with the fiducial @xmath0cdm model .",
    "we compute the total volume filling factor of the ionized medium @xmath157 from the results of our ray - tracing calculations .",
    "figure [ qhii ] shows the resulting ionized volume fraction , and figure [ tot_tau ] shows the thomson optical depth @xmath158 as a function of redshift . in the figures ,",
    "we show only the results for our `` massive - halo model '' of source selection for the rsi model . comparing the results for the dim - source model and the massive - halo model",
    ", we found that there is no substantial difference between the two in either @xmath159 or @xmath160 .",
    "we note , however , that the overall morphology of the ionized regions looks somewhat different between the two cases , because there are more sources in the dim - source model that reside in less dense regions .",
    "nevertheless , for global quantities such as the total optical depth , the two models are found to be quite similar .    on the other hand ,",
    "the results for the @xmath0cdm and the rsi models differ substantially .",
    "as figure [ qhii ] shows , the ionized volume fraction in the rsi model remains small until @xmath161 , and then rapidly increases close to unity at @xmath162 . at later epochs , @xmath163 ,",
    "the abundance of high mass ( @xmath164 ) halos rapidly increases , and the total star - formation ( and hence the photon production ) is dominated by such large halos .",
    "this can also be understood in terms of the halo mass function at @xmath154 shown in figure [ mfz7 ] . by this time , the mass functions for the two models are already quite similar , with the difference being only a constant factor of roughly two ( compare with the much larger difference at @xmath52 at smaller mass scales shown in figure [ mfz17 ] ) .",
    "namely , the rsi model quickly catches up with the @xmath0cdm model in the abundance of halos around @xmath165 ( see also the increasing sfr in figure [ sfr ] ) , which causes the rapid increase in the ionized volume fraction as seen in figure [ qhii ] .",
    "reionization is nearly completed ( @xmath166 ) at @xmath167 in the @xmath0cdm model , whereas it occurs at @xmath168 in the rsi model .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ tot_tau ] , the resulting total optical depth @xmath169 for the rsi model is still small , owing to the small @xmath157 at earlier epochs .",
    "we emphasize that a large thomson optical depth can be achieved only if reionization occurs early (  6 ) . in other words , after reionization is completed , the additional     + photon supply does not matter in the total optical depth as long as the igm is kept almost fully ionized thereafter , as implied by figure 7 .",
    "( note that here we discuss only hydrogen reionization . )",
    "our fiducial @xmath0cdm case with @xmath153 predicts a larger total optical depth than the rsi model with @xmath156 by @xmath170 .",
    "the difference mostly comes from the fact that @xmath157 is still quite small at @xmath171 in the rsi model .",
    "interestingly , none of the `` conventional '' scenarios we have considered for `` population ii '' star formation reproduces the claimed high optical depth from wmap of @xmath172 ( 1-@xmath113 ; kogut et al .",
    "it is clear that these models are inconsistent with the wmap measurement and thus may need , for example , additional radiation sources to ionize the igm early on .    in related work , we have shown that an early generation of massive , metal - free stars in mini - halos supplemented by `` ordinary '' star formation at lower redshifts to account for the spectra of high redshift quasars can yield a thomson optical depth approaching that of the wmap measurement in a @xmath0cdm cosmology ( yoshida et al .",
    "2003b ,     + sokasian et al .",
    "2003b ) , along the lines suggested by haiman & holder ( 2003 ) and cen ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , it does not appear that a similar conclusion will obtain for the rsi model because of the low abundance of mini - halos at high redshifts , as we found in the case of a warm dark matter model with particle mass 10 kev ( yoshida et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "the results described above indicate that the rsi model is incompatible with a high thomson optical depth like that suggested by the wmap measurements . a remaining loophole in this argument",
    "is that the stellar population in galaxies at early times may have differed from that in our underlying model so that a larger number of ionizing photons were produced from galaxies at @xmath173 than we assumed above ( e.g. ciardi , ferrara & white 2003 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; sokasian et al .",
    "we first discuss such possibilities quantitatively , and then show numerical results for a model that enhances the photon production rate in galaxies .    for a salpeter - type power - law imf , the hydrogen ionizing photon emission rate of zero - metallicity stars is larger than that of a population ii ( i.e. having metals ) counterpart only by about 50% ( thumlinson & shull 2000 ; see leitherer et al .",
    "1999 for low - metallicity cases . ) .",
    "the stellar imf in the first galaxies may have had even an extreme top - heavy shape , with massive stars exclusively forming out of a primeval gas ( schwarzschild & spitzer 1953 ; matsuda , sato & takeda 1969 ; yoshii & saio 1986 ; larson 1998 ; abel , bryan & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi & larson 2002 ) .",
    "very massive population iii stars are efficient emitters of uv photons , with the hydrogen ionizing photon emission rate per stellar mass being up to 10 - 20 times higher than for ordinary stellar populations ( bromm , kudritzki & loeb 2001 ; schaerer 2002 ) .",
    "it is thus conceivable that , in early galaxies , the photon emission rate per stellar mass was @xmath174 times higher than that of the `` population ii '' case we considered above .",
    "more specifically , the predicted star - formation rate for the rsi model shown in figure [ sfr ] is     + @xmath175 at @xmath89 . assuming a constant conversion factor of @xmath176 ionizing photons per star - formation rate of 1 @xmath177 for an ordinary stellar population with solar metallicity ( madau , haardt & rees 1999 ) , we obtain a total rate of @xmath178 ionizing photons per second per cubic comoving 1 mpc volume at @xmath89 for our fiducial rsi model .",
    "if all the formed stars have a mass of @xmath179 , the star - formation rate of @xmath175 corresponds to the formation of 5 such stars every three million years within the volume .",
    "the calculation of bromm et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggests that a total emission rate of @xmath180 ionizing photons per second , a 50 times higher photon emission rate , can be maintained in this case , _ assuming _ such very massive stars are continuously formed .",
    "( note that these massive stars are typically short - lived , with a main - sequence lifetime of about two million years . )",
    "we thus conclude that a 100 times higher photon production rate than assumed in our original rsi model serves as a conservative upper limit .",
    "we examine the overall effect of such an additional photon supply by `` boosting '' the photon emission rate of the sources in the rsi massive - halo model .",
    "sokasian et al . (",
    "2003a ) found that boosting the photon emission rate at high redshifts progressively shifts the reionization epoch ( see their figure 13 ) .",
    "motivated by their result , we employ a simple prescription which increases the emission rate of individual sources according to @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 are the original and the boosted photon emission rates , respectively . with this parametrization",
    ", the ionizing photon emission rate of the galaxies steeply increases toward higher redshift , modeling either a transition of the stellar imf or a contribution from massive population iii stars or both .",
    "this rather extreme model requires effectively more than a @xmath184 times higher photon emission rate at @xmath173 , and more than @xmath37 times higher at @xmath2 .",
    "we carry out radiative transfer simulations for the rsi model with this luminosity `` boost '' .",
    "figure [ tau_boost ] shows the resulting @xmath159 .",
    "the reionization epoch is found to be shifted to earlier times , @xmath185 , than in the case considered in  6.3 , and consequently @xmath158 is greatly increased compared with the fiducial rsi model",
    ". however , the total optical depth for this boost model reaches @xmath186 at @xmath187 , _ still lower _ than the 1-@xmath113 range of the wmap result .",
    "our numerical simulations of early structure formation show that primordial gas cloud formation in low - mass `` mini - halos '' is very inefficient at @xmath2 in the rsi model , making it unlikely that the `` first stars '' contribute significantly to reionization in this scenario . using radiative transfer calculations",
    ", we also show that reionization by ordinary ( `` population ii '' ) stellar sources in galaxies is completed late in the rsi model if we employ conventional models of star - formation . in order to be compatible with the epoch of the end stage of reionization inferred from high redshift quasar observations , the photon escape fraction from galaxies",
    "must be large , @xmath188 .",
    "we found that the resulting total thomson optical depth in this case is @xmath189 , in apparent conflict with the recent wmap measurements of cmb polarization .    in order for the total optical depth to be as large as @xmath190 , reionization",
    "must be completed before @xmath191 ( figure [ z_tau ] ) .",
    "ciardi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and wyithe & loeb ( 2003 ) suggest that employing an effectively top - heavy imf may be necessary to cause early reionization . cen ( 2003 )",
    "argues that a large thomson optical depth could be obtained if the `` population iii era '' is prolonged so that massive stars continuously form until quite low redshift .",
    "if a large volume of the igm could be kept chemically pristine until low redshift ( @xmath185 ) due to the very low global star - formation rate in the rsi model , the stellar imf in galaxies may be top - heavy ( schneider et al . 2002 ; mackey , bromm & hernquist 2003 ) .",
    "unfortunately , little is presently known about star - formation in a primordial gas in high mass halos the `` first galaxies'' and clearly needs to be addressed using numerical simulations as well as theoretical modeling ( larson 1998 ; omukai 2001 ; oh & haiman 2002 ) . we have explored the possibility of enhancing the photon emission rate by employing a simple prescription .",
    "the model parameters were chosen such that the photon emission rate is close to a plausible maximum bound .",
    "our analysis has shown that , whereas the extreme boost model does predict an earlier reionization epoch @xmath192 and a larger total optical depth @xmath193 , the result is still marginally inconsistent with the wmap data .",
    "recent numerical simulations by bromm , yoshida & hernquist ( 2003 ) show that early population iii supernovae quickly pollute the surrounding igm with metals . if many massive population iii stars are formed in `` mini - halos '' and explode as hyper - energetic supernovae , the global metal - enrichment of the igm is quickly achieved to such a degree that a transition of the stellar imf is caused at a very early epoch ( yoshida , bromm & hernquist 2003 ) .",
    "then , the large photon production rate at @xmath25 we hypothesized as coming from metal - free stars can not be maintained for a sufficiently long time , and the reionization history in the rsi model will be just as shown in figure [ qhii ] , with a small total optical depth ( @xmath194 ) as shown in figure [ tot_tau ] .    in the end , we are left with a contradiction : the running of the primordial power spectrum favored by the wmapext + 2df + lyman-@xmath11 analysis and the high thomson optical depth measured by the wmap satellite appear to be inconsistent with one other .",
    "we have discussed various possibilities to resolve the conflict , and conclude that a rather radical solution or a fine - tuned combination , if any is possible , of the proposed resolutions are necessary .",
    "models with a weaker running of the primordial power spectrum will alleviate the discrepancy slightly , but the overall results would not be changed .",
    "if the high thomson optical depth is confirmed and the running of the primordial power spectrum turns out to be real , it may be necessary to invoke exotic radiation sources other than stellar populations or some ionization mechanisms .",
    "such scenarios include decaying particles ( sciama 1982 ; dodelson & jubas 1992 ; hansen & haiman 2003 ) or formation of early mini - quasars ( eisenstein & loeb 1995 ; sasaki & umemura 1996 ) .",
    "the prospects for observationally resolving this discrepancy in the near future appear bright .",
    "data from planned cmb polarization experiments , by the continued operation of wmap , and post - wmap observatories such as planck will pin down a precise value for @xmath158 .",
    "lyman-@xmath11 forest observations exploiting a large sample of sdss quasars will place a tighter constraint on the matter power spectrum on large scales , as will the sdss galaxy redshift survey . in the longer term",
