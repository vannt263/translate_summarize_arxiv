    "momentum balance in light - matter interactions is a subtle subject that has been debated for over a century .",
    "discussions of the issues involved , together with references to much of the relevant literature , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "this paper makes no attempt to contribute to the momentum - balance debate , in that there will be no investigation of the transfer of momentum ( or energy ) from light to matter or vice versa .",
    "instead we isolate a related problem , but one that is mathematically well - posed and therefore capable of an exact and unambiguous solution .",
    "the problem solved here is : what is the conserved energy - momentum tensor of light propagating in a homogeneous , dispersive , lossless magnetodielectric medium ? this is a well - posed problem of macroscopic electromagnetism , but it appears not to have been fully addressed in the existing literature on electromagnetic energy - momentum , where the primary focus has been on momentum transfer between light and matter .",
    "although the solution is an example of noether s theorem , the presence of dispersion means that the well - known expression for the energy - momentum tensor of a field theory in terms of its lagrangian density is not valid in this case .",
    "in fact the result can not be derived in any systematic way from maxwell s equations or a lagrangian density .",
    "dispersive macroscopic electromagnetism must be formulated in terms of an action principle , and the noether theorem for space - time translation symmetry must be derived from the action , leading to an exact conserved energy - momentum tensor .",
    "the problem in fact presents a significant calculational challenge , which may explain its absence from the momentum - balance literature . by isolating this problem from the conundrum of momentum transfer ,",
    "we show that the issue of electromagnetic energy - momentum in dispersive media is amenable to some mathematically exact and unambiguous statements .",
    "the restriction to lossless media in this paper requires comment on the physical significance of the results .",
    "a complete treatment of macroscopic electromagnetism at all frequencies must include the absorption in the materials that is necessarily strong in some frequency ranges .",
    "mathematically , this dissipation is a consequence of the restriction to retarded solutions of maxwell s equations , which leads to the kramers - kronig relations  @xcite . as is well known  @xcite , quantifying electromagnetic energy - momentum in dissipative media is problematic , and in any case such energy - momentum will of course not be conserved . in optics ,",
    "on the other hand , one often deals with limited frequency ranges where losses are negligible , but where material dispersion can not be ignored .",
    "an example of the utmost experimental and practical importance is fiber optics  @xcite , where in many circumstances absorption can be ignored not only in the entire visible range , but also into the infrared and ultraviolet . in such",
    "a large frequency range dispersion plays a crucial role in light propagation and can not be neglected  @xcite .",
    "the question of how much conserved energy - momentum is being transported by light has an unambiguous answer in these circumstances , and the result is experimentally significant . for example , a light beam encountering an intense pulse can be frequency shifted through non - linearity of the medium , and the amount of electromagnetic energy that is frequency shifted depends , among other factors , on the energy - momentum tensor of the light beam .",
    "one example of such an experiment is described in  @xcite , where the light beam encountering the intense pulse was monochromatic ; this represents the simplest case , but for a light beam with a complicated spectrum the general expression for the energy - momentum tensor is required to fully describe the behaviour of the beam .",
    "this exact energy - momentum tensor is derived here .",
    "the results obtained below generalize a well - known approximation for electromagnetic energy in dispersive media .",
    "as is familiar from the textbook treatments  @xcite , the poynting theorem that follows from maxwell s equations does not directly lead to an expression for the electromagnetic energy density in the case of lossless , dispersive media .",
    "the standard procedure  @xcite is to make a restriction to quasi - monochromatic fields , in which case one can extract an approximate expression for the time - averaged energy density , due to brillouin ( eq .  ( [ brill ] ) below ) . for general fields one is reduced to making a formal time integration of the poynting theorem  @xcite .",
    "but as noted above , in the dispersive case one can not derive noether s theorem from a systematic manipulation of the dynamical equations of the theory , as is done in the poynting theorem ; instead , one must start with the action that underlies the equations .",
    "noether s theorem guarantees the existence of an exact energy density for arbitrary fields in lossless dispersive media and this energy density is derived here .    in the case of electromagnetic momentum density",
    ", the dispersionless result is the familiar minkowski expression  @xcite @xmath0 .",
    "we note again that this statement refers to the conserved electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor : the minkowski momentum density @xmath0 unambiguously gives the conserved electromagnetic momentum of light propagating in a non - dispersive , lossless , homogeneous medium  @xcite .",
    "it is shown below that in dispersive media the momentum density is more complicated , and is not given by minkowski s formula .",
    "the results follow straightforwardly once an action principle is written for electromagnetism in dispersive , lossless media . for this purpose",
    "the dynamical variables must be taken to be the scalar potential @xmath1 and vector potential @xmath2 , defined by @xmath3 the relationship between fields in the time and frequency domains ( the latter denoted by a tilde ) is , for the example of the electric field , @xmath4 where the reality of @xmath5 implies @xmath6 . in the frequency domain",
    "we have @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the relative permittivity of the ( in general inhomogeneous ) medium , @xmath9 , and the relative permeability is @xmath10 . as the medium can be assumed to be lossless in the frequency range of interest , @xmath8 and @xmath11 are real and even functions of @xmath12  @xcite , and so they have the series expansions @xmath13 where these equations define the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in practice , the series ( [ matseries ] ) will represent a fit to the dispersion data of the material for the frequency range of interest ; we take these series to be infinite , but the subsequent results also hold when they are finite series . equations ( [ efreq])([matseries ] ) show that in the time domain the maxwell equations ( with no free charges or currents ) are @xmath16=0 ,   \\label{max1 }   \\\\ \\kappa_0\\nabla\\times[\\kappa(\\mathbf{r},i\\partial_t)\\mathbf{b}]=\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{r},i\\partial_t)\\partial_t\\mathbf{e } , \\label{max2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] while the other two maxwell equations are automatically satisfied because of ( [ pots ] ) .",
    "note that series expansions of the form ( [ matseries ] ) are standard in treating dispersion in frequency ranges where losses are negligible , for example in linear and nonlinear fiber optics  @xcite .",
    "moreover the transformation from the frequency to the time domain apparent in ( [ max1])([max2 ] ) , and the reverse transformation , are a standard part of numerical solution procedures for the propagation of wave packets with spectra within the frequency range where expansions ( [ matseries ] ) are valid , for example in the split - step method  @xcite .",

    "the fact that only even - order time derivatives occur in ( [ max1])([max2 ] ) is essential to being able to write an action principle for these equations . for dissipative",
    "media , terms with odd - order time derivatives occur in ( [ max1])([max2 ] ) , arising from the imaginary parts of @xmath8 and @xmath11 which are odd functions of @xmath12  @xcite ; but the action ( [ act ] ) would not generate these terms . in the action ( [ act ] ) , terms of the form @xmath19 , for example , would not contribute to the dynamical equations because their variation gives zero after integrations by parts : @xmath20 , and the second term becomes minus the first upon integrations by parts .",
    "it must of course be impossible to write an action in the dissipative case that is a functional only of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , since this would imply the existence of a conserved electromagnetic energy in lossy media ( see below ) .",
    "the action ( [ act ] ) is invariant under active time translations of the dynamical fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and this invariance implies , through noether s theorem , the existence of a conserved quantity , the energy .",
    "the extraction of the conservation law from the action is a standard technique of field theory ( see  @xcite , for example ) .",
    "even if one is unfamiliar with noether s theorem , one can of course verify using the field equations ( [ max1])([max2 ] ) that the resulting conservation law does in fact hold .",
    "the theorem  @xcite shows that if we make an active infinitesimal time translation @xmath21 , @xmath22 , but take the translation @xmath23 to vary in space and time , then the change in the action can be reduced to the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy density and @xmath26 is the energy flux , obeying the conservation law @xmath27 the variation @xmath28 will clearly be linear in the infinitesimal translation @xmath23 , but various numbers of integrations by parts are required to achieve the form ( [ actvart ] ) ( surface terms produced by the integrations are to be dropped ) .",
