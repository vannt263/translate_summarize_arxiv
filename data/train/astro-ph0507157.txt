    "the japanese infrared astronomy mission astro - f is a second generation infrared all - sky survey mission following the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras , neugebauer et al .",
    "1984 ) with much improved sensitivities , spatial resolutions and wider wavelength coverage .",
    "astro - f is equipped with a 69 cm cooled ( approximately to 6k ) ritchey - chretien type telescope and two focal plane instruments covering the 2 - 160@xmath1 m wavelength range . in august 2003 , nasa launched the spitzer space telescope ( sst ) , an 85 cm cooled telescope with three focal plane instruments covering the 3 - 160@xmath1 m wavelength range ( werner et al .",
    "astro - f will be complementary to sst with respect to having wider sky coverage and continuous wavelength coverage .",
    "astro - f is now scheduled to be launched in january - february 2006 by the m - v rocket of jaxa ( japan aerospace exploration agency ) , and it is expected that the mission will provide an invaluable database for planning of observations with the herschel space observatory ( pilbratt 2003 ) .    the purpose of this paper is to present the updated pre - flight sensitivities in various observing modes , and to describe the current observation plan with emphasis on the large - area surveys .",
    "details of the astro - f mission and satellite system are described in murakami ( 2004 ) .",
    "further details on the current performance of the focal plane instruments are described in kawada et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and onaka et al .",
    "the orbit of astro - f is a sun - synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 750 km and at an inclination of 98.4 deg .",
    "the spacecraft + y - axis ( shown in figure  [ spacecraft ] ) is always pointed in the direction of the sun , thus avoiding the sunlight illuminating the telescope baffles .",
    "while orbiting around the earth with a period of approximately 100 minutes , the astro - f spacecraft spins around the y - axis avoiding the earthshine from illuminating the telescope .",
    "thus , this attitude ensures a stable thermal condition of the spacecraft , and moreover results in a continuous scan of the sky with a speed of 3.6 arcminutes per minute .",
    "figure  [ orbit ] ( left ) schematically shows the attitude of astro - f in this all - sky survey mode",
    ". a second method of operation is the pointing mode , where the telescope observes a certain sky position for a longer exposure with the focal - plane instruments ( figure  [ orbit ] right ) . due to the limitations required to prevent earthshine from illuminating",
    "the telescope baffle , the duration of the pointing mode of operation is limited to 10 minutes . the visibility zone(_i.e .",
    "_ allowed peak - to - peak angle of the pointing direction in the cross - scan direction ) is @xmath2deg , which is determined by the field - of - view of the onboard fine sun sensor and by the design of the baffle and the sun shield .",
    "the attitude control system provides additional capabilities to slightly change the pointing direction for the pointing modes : step - scan , slow - scan , and micro - scan .",
    "the slow - scan is a uniform scan with a much slower scan speed(less than 30 arcseconds per second ) than that of the all - sky survey .",
    "the slow - scan survey is especially useful for covering a much larger sky areas than those obtainable by pointing , to much better sensitivities than that of the all - sky survey .",
    "however , the overheads for a pointing attitude mode are significantly large : approximately 20 minutes is required for the maneuvering and stabilization .",
    "hence the number of pointing observations in one orbit is restricted to three or less .",
    "astro - f incorporates two focal plane instruments covering the infrared wavelength from 2 to 160  @xmath1 m .",
    "the first focal plane instrument is the far - infrared surveyor ( fis , kawada et al .",
    "2004 ) which will primarily survey the entire sky simultaneously in four far - infrared bands from 50 to 160  @xmath1 m with approximately diffraction - limited spatial resolutions ( 30 - 60 arcsec ) .",
    "the second focal - plane instrument is the infrared camera ( irc , wada et al .",
    "2003 ; onaka et al .",
    "2004 ) , which is designed to take deep images of selected sky regions by pointed observations from 2 to 26  @xmath1 m .",
    "both instruments are equipped with spectroscopic capabilities with moderate or low resolution , however , they are beyond the scope of this paper . figure  [ fov ] shows the field - of - view configuration on the sky , and the waveband characteristics for broad - band imaging are summarized in table  [ tab_imaging ] .",
    "the pre - flight sensitivities estimated from the current laboratory experiments of the telescope and the instruments at low temperature are shown in table  [ tab_survey ] , [ tab_pointing ] , and [ tab_slow ] .",
    "the primary objective of the astro - f mission is to make an all - sky survey in 6 wavebands covering 9 - 160@xmath1 m . in addition",
    ", large - area _ legacy _ surveys in pointing mode are also planned in two dedicated fields near the ecliptic poles : the north ecliptic pole ( nep ) itself and the large magellanic could ( lmc ) near the south ecliptic pole ( sep ) .      in the all sky survey mode",
    ", the telescope beam continuously scans along a great circle perpendicular to the direction of the sun with a period of 100 minutes(see figure  [ orbit ] ) .",
    "hence the survey paths are nearly aligned to the ecliptic lines of longitude , with approximately 4.1 arcmin spacing at the ecliptic plane between successive orbits .",
    "since the cross - scan width of the short - wave channel of the fis is 8.2arcmin , the single  hours confirmation \" can be established at every point of the sky , as long as successive orbits are useful for observations without , for example , the presence of the south atlantic anormaly or the moon . in phase-1 ,",
    "most of the sky ( approximately 85%-95% , depending on the observation scenario , see next section ) will be observed in 6 wavebands covering 9160@xmath1 m ( table  [ tab_imaging ] and [ tab_survey ] ) .",
    "supplementary survey observations will be made in phase-2 in order to fill the gaps in the phase-1 sky coverage . the flux limit ( for one scan ) of the astro - f all - sky survey",
    "is shown in figure  [ fl_survey ] compared with those of large - area surveys at other wavelengths .",
    "the uniqueness of the astro - f all - sky survey lies in its wider wavelength coverage(up to 160@xmath1 m ) and much finer spatial resolution compared to that of iras .",
    "moreover , thanks to the high visibility in the regions near the ecliptic poles , we will also be able to obtain a faint source catalog with fluxes down to 80mjy at 90@xmath1 m ( 5@xmath3 ) over a substantially large area(@xmath44000 deg@xmath5 ) , which will complement the on - going swire(lonsdale et al .",
    "2004 ) survey with sst ( see figure  [ deptharea](right ) ) .",
    "astro - f in all - sky survey mode will detect approximately half million galaxies tracing the large - scale structure of the universe out to redshifts of unity , detecting rare , exotic extraordinarily luminous objects at high redshift , numerous brown dwarfs , vega - like stars , protostars , and will reveal the large - scale structure of the star - forming regions in both the solar neighbourhood , the distribution of the interplanetary dust in our solar system , and towards the galactic plane where sst can not observe because of the saturation of its detectors ( 30 - 50 mjy / sr at 160@xmath1 m ) .      due to the constraint of the orbit and the rather limited visibility zone ( see the previous section ) , the sky visibility for the astro - f telescope is strongly weighted toward the ecliptic poles .",
    "hence a large area survey of more than @xmath41 deg@xmath5 in the pointing mode is only possible in regions close to the ecliptic poles .",
    "figure  [ nepsep ] shows the location of the survey fields currently planned in the pointing mode .",
    "the main driver for the nep survey is an unbiased survey of extragalactic sources .",
    "the survey is divided into two realizations :  nep - deep \" and  nep - wide \" .",
    "the former is a deep survey consisting of 504 pointing observations covering 0.5  deg@xmath5 .",
    "this is designed to obtain two major science goals : the dusty star - formation history of the universe out to @xmath6 , and the mass assembly history and evolution of large scale structure out to @xmath7 .",
    "the irc in the broad band imaging mode will be used for this survey , with 9 wavebands covering 2.4 - 24@xmath1 m .",
    "deep optical and near infrared ( up to the @xmath8-band ) imaging data are already available in this field .",
    "the latter  nep - wide \" survey is a 6.2  deg@xmath5 shallow survey over a circular area centered near the nep with 450 pointing observations in total .",
    "this survey is especially designed to complement the survey volume of the  nep - deep \" observing program for the @xmath9 universe ( _ i.e. _ to limit uncertainties due to the significant cosmic variance in the @xmath10 universe ) .",
    "nine irc wavebands will be used for this survey .",
    "inclusion of the n2 band ( 2.4@xmath1 m ) is mandatory for the study of spatial fluctuations of the cosmic near infrared background .",
    "the most important role of these surveys is to perform large - area 11 and 15@xmath1 m surveys , which can not be done with sst .",
    "the 15@xmath1 m survey volume with astro - f / irc will far exceed that of iso , generating a sample of more than ten thousand ulirg / starburst galaxies .",
    "thanks to the continuous wavelength coverage of the astro - f / irc over the 8 - 24@xmath1 m range , we will be able to estimate photometric redshifts by using the silicate / pah features , allowing us to construct accurate luminosity functions to @xmath11 .",
    "the depth in the mid - infrared and the sky coverage of the nep survey are compared with other missions(iso , sst ) in figure  [ deptharea](left ) .",
    "figure  [ nepsep](left ) also shows the location of the elais - n1 field , an on - going sst / swire legacy survey field located at the highest ecliptic latitude , which is a candidate for a follow - up study with astro - f . except for the 10 - 20@xmath1 m region ,",
    "deep multi - wavelength data has already been accumulated and a follow - up study using solely the 11 and 15@xmath1 m bands in the irc will provide us with a complementary data set to that expected from the  nep - wide \" survey .    as for the far infrared data at the nep , since so many scan paths overlap at the pole , the all - sky survey will reach the galaxy confusion limit .",
    "this depth is enough to yield the far - infrared detection of @xmath12 hyper - luminous infrared galaxies(with @xmath13 infrared luminosity ) which will be identified in the mid infrared with the astro - f / irc .",
    "however , such a faint source extraction will be a very hard task and likely to be time consuming .",
    "we may therefore consider an additional slow - scan survey with the fis which only requires a few @xmath410 pointing observations , to generate deep far infrared images of the nep rather quickly .",
    "the lmc is seen in nearly face - on , and its proximity ( @xmath450kpc ) provides us with a unique opportunity to resolve and separate individual components even in the far infrared ( @xmath14 corresponds to 8pc at the distance of the lmc ) .",
    "the lmc has been observed at many other wavelengths ( x , uv , optical , near infrared , @xmath15 , hi , co ) . the lmc was also extensively observed in the mid infrared by the midcourse space experiment ( msx ) over 100  deg@xmath16 area with a flux limit of 50  mjy at 8@xmath1 m ( egan et al .",
    "therefore , the lmc is one of the best target fields for the study of interstellar matter , star - formation , and late - type stars . as an astro - f large - area survey , an approximately 20 deg@xmath5 fan - shape area will be surveyed in 6 irc imaging bands covering 3.3 - 26@xmath1mdeg@xmath16 lmc survey with sst has been approved in the go-2 observations . thus the astro - f survey strategy may be slightly revised . ] .",
    "the survey area covers the molecular ridge , supernova remnants , and other interesting regions .",
    "these 6 band data can distinguish and identify the nature of detected objects , such as proto - stellar objects , young stellar objects , and agb stars .",
    "the required number of pointing observations is 950 in total .",
    "the astro - f / irc survey will provide mid - infrared images with higher angular resolution and sensitivities than those of msx , and is complementary to sst in its continuous wavelength coverage including the 11 and 15@xmath1 m bands",
    ". these bands are particularily useful in investigating the formation and destruction processes of very small grains and pahs .",
    "the astro - f data , when combined with sst ones , will address a number of astrophysical problems , ranging the entire birth to death cycles of stars , and give us a first insight into the detailed material circulation in a galaxy .      since the lmc is not always observable during the mission , additional pointing surveys can be allocated somewhere near the sep , as long as this does not reduce the sky coverage of the all - sky survey .",
    "the chamaeleon molecular cloud is relatively close to the pole(@xmath17=60 - 65deg ) and hence it is possible to search for young stellar objects and proto - planetary disks extensively by using a slow - scan survey in both the irc and fis wavebands . in addition , as shown in figure  [ nepsep ] ( right ) , near the south ecliptic pole there is a low - cirrus region ( shlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) which will be an optimum field for the study of the large - scale fluctuations of the cosmic far infrared background .",
    "astro - f / fis is more suitable for the study of such diffuse sources than sst / mips , thanks to its larger pixel field - of - view .",
    "moreover cross - correlation analysis between the 4 fis wavebands is a unique capability of astro - f .",
    "each large - area survey requires a dedicated team for the observation planning and the data analysis .",
    "in particular for the all - sky survey , pipeline development to generate the point source catalogue has been on - going by an international data handling team ( japan , korea , united kingdom , the netherlands ) . from the all - sky survey data ,",
    "the following source catalogues will be released :    * astro - f fluxes of known sources ( especially iras psc ) : released in the survey period . * bright source catalogue(bsc ) : this is the primary all - sky survey product with uniform flux limit ( table  [ tab_survey ] ) over the entire sky . the catalogue release is planned to commence one month from the end of the survey and finished within one year after the end of the survey . * faint source catalogue(fsc ) : supplemental catalogue of the fainter sources in the regions with higher redundancy ( _ i.e. _ regions at high ecliptic latitudes )",
    ". the fsc release date will be at least one year after the release of the bsc .",
    "the catalogues will be initially released to the astro - f team , and then open to the public one year later .",
    "image data , especially on small scales , will also be released , although more investigation is still necessary to define the data release plan .",
    "regarding the data products of the nep and the lmc surveys , the bsc as well as fsc are also generated in a similar manner to those of the all - sky survey , but the internal release to the astro - f team will commence during the survey period .",
    "moreover , basic image data ( output from the very early - stage processing ) will also be released with the associated pipeline tools , astronomical calibration tools and tables , and scientific analysis tools which will be developed by the data analysis team for the nep and the lmc surveys .",
    "these catalogues , the basic image data , and the tools will also be opened to the public approximately 1 year after the internal release .",
    "observations with astro - f can be divided into the following phases :    * pv phase [ l(launch)+1  l+2months ] : observations for performance verification of the whole system .",
    "* phase 1 [ l+2  l+8months ] : primarily for the all - sky survey . however , pointing observations toward fields close to the ecliptic poles are planned on orbits passing through the saa . * phase 2 [ l+8  l+18months(boil - off of liquid he ) ] : supplemental all - sky survey for the area not sufficiently covered in phase-1 , and pointing observations at any position on the sky .",
    "* phase 3 [ after boil - off of liquid he ] : pointing observations with only the near infrared channel of the irc , which will work after the liquid he has boiled off .",
    "the duration of this phase is uncertain but is limited by the life of the mechanical coolers",
    ".    not only the large - area surveys described in the previous section , but also the following observation programs are planned :    * mission program ( mp ) : an organized program of pointing observations planned by the astro - f science working groups ( astro - f team plus collaborators from around the world ) .",
    "the targets are spread over large areas and can not be included in the nep and lmc surveys . *",
    "open - time program ( op ) : a program of pointing observations whose observing time will be open to japan , korea , and esa communities .",
    "30% of pointing observation opportunities in phases 2 and 3 will be allocated to op . * director s time : observing time allocated to the project manager , including the  target of opportunities \" time .",
    "less than 5% of the total observation has been considered so far . *",
    "calibration time : for the long - term maintenance and performance verification for each instrument , calibration observations should be made at regular periods .",
    "since astro - f is not an observatory but a sky surveyor for specific purposes , detailed observation plans especially for phases before the boil - off of the liquid helium have to be determined before the launch .",
    "this means we have to perform detailed pre - launch simulations of the time allocation and the spacecraft operations during the mission .",
    "the purpose of the simulation is to check the all - sky survey accomplishment and to obtain realistic numbers for the pointing opportunities .    as a first step ,",
    "we have made a simple simulation of the time allocation during phases 1 and 2 for four models with different allocation policies described in table  [ tab_models ] .",
    "here we define a  saa orbit \" as an orbit that starts immediately after the spacecraft passes through the saa .",
    "a provisional target list has been provided by summing requests from the large area surveys and mp proposals .",
    "the total number of requested pointing observations is 11,349 . for simplicity",
    "we ignore the detailed observational operation of the focal - plane instruments , and do not consider any scientific priority in the target list .",
    "these models are characterized by the phase 1 policy : model 1 has no pointing observations while model 2 has pointing observations for regions at any ecliptic latitude during an saa orbit . in models 3 and 4",
    "the nep and lmc pointing surveys are made using the saa orbits , but at lower ecliptic latitude no pointing observations are made , the orbit segments between the nep and the lmc being used for the all - sky survey .",
    "the capability to maneuver the telescope in the cross - scan direction up to @xmath181deg is very useful to overcome conflicts in the target list .",
    "the resulting number of pointing opportunities allocated is shown in the last column of table  [ tab_models ] .",
    "the number of pointings allocated vary significantly between 5 and 10 thousand amongst the models . the resulting all - sky survey coverage is shown in figure  [ norbarea ] . here , we define as an index of survey accomplishment  @xmath19 \" , the number of the scan paths in all - sky survey mode at a given point on the sky is slightly different from the definition of _ hcon _ of iras , because scan paths counted as @xmath19 are not always successive ones . ] .",
    "the  not - reserved \" duration means that there is no appropriate target ( for pointing or even for a survey scan with @xmath20 ) .",
    "however , by default , such times should be used for the survey , then the resulting sky coverage is shown in figure  [ norbarea ] ( right ) .",
    "the all - sky survey covers @xmath090% of the sky with @xmath21 in all of the models .",
    "also more than 10% of the sky is covered with @xmath22 : the medium deep survey in figure  [ deptharea ] ( right ) . to generate a reliable point source catalog and images from the all - sky survey , allocations to the survey observations for",
    "the area of @xmath23 should be prior to the pointing observations . at the moment",
    "this simulation is still preliminary , since no such priority is considered .",
    "further investigation of the scheduling is necessary and is on - going , also considering the dead pixels of the fis and cosmic - ray hits , since these effects degrade the all - sky survey completeness .",
    "we have described the updated pre - flight sensitivities as well as as the observation plan with astro - f , the first japanese satellite mission dedicated for large area surveys in the infrared .",
    "the primary objective of the astro - f mission is to make an all - sky survey in 6 wavebands covering 9 - 160@xmath1 m .",
    "large - area _ legacy _ surveys in pointing mode will be also performed over large areas in the nep and lmc regions .",
    "based on a preliminary simulation of the time allocation for both the all - sky survey and the pointing observations , we discuss the accomplishment of the survey , and the realistic number of pointing opportunities .",
    "the astro - f project is managed by the institute of space and astronautical science ( isas ) of jaxa , in collaboration with universities and institutes in japan , korea , uk , and the netherlands .",
