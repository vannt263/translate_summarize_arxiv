    "it is now known that they do exist @xcite , but they can not be based on stabilizer sets @xcite , as is typical in even dimensions  a conclusion drawn from studies of the discrete wigner function for odd dimensions @xcite .    the newly discovered ghz contradictions in odd-@xmath10 systems @xcite are based on concurrent observables @xcite - observables that are not compatible but have a common eigenstate .",
    "these are not the stabilizers usually associated with graph states , both because they lack compatibility and because local measurement bases are not exclusively those of the generalized pauli operators .",

    "thus , introducing the nonuniformity decreases the two largest terms while increasing only the smallest .",
    "this can produce a net gain in @xmath55 only if the rotations bring the two largest terms into closer alignment .",
    "this unlikely scenario is actually realized in the few cases , @xmath72 , 7 , and 9 .    to demonstrate , first consider odd @xmath6 . with @xmath24 values listed on table i , it is easy to see that the three vectors comprising @xmath73 in either [ fmhvunif ] or [ fmhvoneout ] are collinear for every odd @xmath74 . in [ fmhvunif ] , the @xmath75 term is aligned opposite to the @xmath76 and @xmath77 terms , so that |v(_k)_unif| = ( a^n - b^n - c^n ) .",

    "we still have to rule out more complex hv models  this is done below .",
    "now consider even @xmath6 : again with @xmath24 values listed on table i , one can easily see that the three vectors in ( uniform @xmath46 ) are minimally aligned in the complex plane ( angular separations are @xmath82 ) .",
    "nonuniformity ( [ fmhvoneout ] ) shrinks the two longer vectors as above , while the induced rotations improve their alignment somewhat ( to the smaller of the angular separations @xmath71 , @xmath71 , and @xmath83 ) , but not enough to provide a net gain in @xmath55 : keeping the two dominant terms in each of , whose angular separations are @xmath82 and @xmath71 , respectively , it is easy to show formally that @xmath84 is positive for all @xmath85 . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the exact calculations described above show that both hv models realize the maximum value . hence @xmath79 provides the maximum for all even @xmath6 .    to rule out further hv models for all even and odd @xmath9 : first consider the alternate single departure , ( @xmath86 , others unity ) .",
    "the largest term is reduced sharply , by @xmath87 ; the next largest is increased slightly , by @xmath88 ; but their relative alignment remains unchanged ( only the @xmath77 term changes both ) .",
    "so this model is ruled out trivially .",
    "multiple departures from uniformity may be viewed as sequences of single departures in which every step has the following properties : ( i ) either it reduces the two longest vectors , or it reduces the longest by more than it increases the next - longest , and ( ii ) beyond the first step , it reproduces angular separations already seen in or [ fmhvoneout ] ) .",
    "thus it can not increase @xmath55 beyond the larger of @xmath79 and @xmath81 .",
    "this concludes the proof of the theorem stated above . to evaluate @xmath45 , it is simplest to use or [ voddoneout ] for odd @xmath6 ; for even @xmath6 one could start with [ fmhvunif ] , but it is also instructive for smaller @xmath6 to write the mermin operator directly from fig .",
    "1b and evaluate at the @xmath89 determined by the theorem .",
    "table i lists the exact maxima , @xmath45 , which are all integers or square roots thereof , along with rounded values of @xmath53 .",
    "the asymptotic form of @xmath45 at large @xmath6 is given by the dominant term in [ fmhvunif ] , namely _",
    "n _ hvm = a^n 1.897^n , [ asymptote ] so that the quantum to classical ratio ( to [ asymptote ] ) diverges as @xmath90 .",
    "this exponential divergence is slow compared with mermin s @xmath91 for qubit systems @xcite ; nevertheless it represents a superposition of three macroscopically distinct states .",
    "ironically , the structure behind the inequalities derived here forms a close parallel with mermin s , despite the compatibility of his observable sets as compared with the mere concurrence of those used here .",
    "this is because his pauli tensor products and their eigenstates are related by the same rotational covariance that forms the basis of the treatment given here .",
    "it is a simple exercise to write down two alternative compatible pauli subsets ( one of which is mermin s ) , and their corresponding joint ghz eigenstates , on diagrams analogous to fig .",
    "1 , where the basic angular interval is @xmath92 rather than @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , mermin s derivation of hv maxima is based on a formula like our , in particular _",
    "k^d=2 = , [ mermingen2 ] obtained by replacing @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the two choices @xmath60 and 1 produce identical @xmath50 and @xmath45 values , resulting in @xmath95 ( even @xmath6 ) , and @xmath96 ( odd @xmath6 ) .    a comparison of suggests why our exponential growth @xmath97 is less dramatic than mermin s .",
    "the maximum length of any factor in the hv expression for qutrits ( [ fmhv ] ) is @xmath98 .",
    "this corresponds to the different angular resolutions of vector factors in , showing minimum angles in the complex plane of @xmath99 _ vs _ @xmath100 .",
    "these differences reflect the greater freedom of qutrit hvs over qubit hvs to attempt to mimic the quantum results .",
    "the above comparison raises the question whether mermin inequalities exist for systems of higher odd dimensions @xmath10 , where compatible observables do not produce ghz contradictions .",
    "it seems plausibible that a similar construction would succeed for any higher prime @xmath10 , although one would expect still weaker violations of local realism for the reason given above . for higher composite dimension ,",
    "a similar but more complex construction might succeed based on the smallest prime factor of @xmath10 .",
    "this may be the most interesting case experimentally .",
    "it is singled out here because its ghz contradictions require three local measurement bases @xcite .",
    "so , while we consider the same three ghz states ( [ ghzstates ] ) , the concurrent operator sets must now incorporate a third local basis , the natural choice given by rotation of individual @xmath28 factors through @xmath101 : w z^2/3 x z^-2/3 = _",

    "again these fall into three concurrent subsets , each associated with an equilateral triangle and its own joint eigenstate in fig . 1a . in this case",
