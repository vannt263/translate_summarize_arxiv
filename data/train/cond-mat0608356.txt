    "the hard disk fluid is the simplest model of various surface systems ( surfactants , adsorption of molecules on smooth surfaces ) .",
    "it has been intensively studied by a number of methods , of which we are interested in monte carlo and molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , virial coefficients @xcite , and equations of state ( eos ) @xcite .",
    "recently , peculiarities of phase transitions from fluid to hexatic to solid are frequently studied @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus mainly on the fluid region .",
    "the fluid phase changes at density of about @xmath1 ( @xmath2 denotes the reduced number density , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of disks , @xmath5 their diameter , and @xmath6 the system area ) to the hexatic phase @xcite .",
    "to obtain accurate data on the eos , we use standard molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in the microcanonical ensemble and tetragonal ( square ) periodic boundary conditions with zero total momentum ( md - nve ; we keep the usual abbreviation nve for constant number of particles  volume  energy even if the volume is here replaced by the area ) .",
    "our md program combines the ideas of the linked - cell list method both in space and time @xcite and is highly optimized .",
    "details on the code are given in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "in the present study , we use @xmath7 and 9000 , and at higher densities 16000 , 25000 and 50000 disks of unit diameter in a square periodic box .",
    "the compressibility factor @xmath8 ( @xmath9 denotes pressure , @xmath10 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath11 absolute temperature ) can be calculated from md simulations in two ways @xcite .",
    "one formula uses the virial of force @xmath12 where the sum is over all collisions occurring during time interval @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the change of velocity of both colliding disks of mutual position @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the kinetic energy ( constant in the md - nve simulation ) . the alternative formula uses the collision rate @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of collisions in time interval @xmath13 and @xcite @xmath19 \\over \\gamma[d(n-1)/2 ] ( dn/2)^{1/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the dimensionality .     for mixing both formulas for @xmath21 in equation ( [ zmd ] ) and the fit bounded by @xmath22 . ]",
    "both formulas give within statistical inaccuracies the same values , but their statistical errors differ .",
    "our final result is therefore a weighed average of both formulas , @xmath23 where the mixing weight @xmath24 is a function of density .",
    "methodology for determining the optimum function @xmath25 has been explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "the simulation results on @xmath26 are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] along with a function fitted to the data and bounded by @xmath22 to avoid too extrapolated values .",
    "this function was used in final analysis of md data to avoid bias .",
    "the initial configuration was a tetragonal crystal with random velocities assigned to particles .",
    "this setup creates a disorder within a few collisions . at higher densities , a locally hexagonal arrangement gradually develops .",
    "therefore a period of equilibration follows until the compressibility factor reaches a constant value with fluctuations . at higher densities and for a large system",
    "this takes a long time .",
    "[ tab1 ]    the finite - size errors are in our pseudoexperimental setup at low densities several times larger than the statistical errors .",
    "e.g. , at the lowest density simulated , @xmath27 , one would need as many as @xmath28 particles to guarantee the same systematic finite - size error as the statistical error of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "it is more efficient to simulate a smaller system and to correct for the finite - size error to obtain the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath29 ) because correlation times and therefore convergence in large two - dimensional systems is slow . at about @xmath30",
    "both errors become comparable for @xmath31 . in a vicinity of the hexatic transition",
    "the finite - size errors become large again and difficult to determine .",
    "the correction procedure can be divided into three steps @xcite : @xmath32 where the first step is already included in formulas ( [ zvir ] ) and ( [ zrate ] ) , and @xmath33vt stands for the grand - canonical ensemble .    the largest source of inaccuracy for hard - body systems is the second step , nvt @xmath34vt @xcite .",
    "this `` ensemble correction '' is caused by suppressed fluctuations of density ( number of particles ) in the canonical ensemble and is given by @xcite @xmath35^{-1 } + { \\cal o}(n^{-2 } ) , \\label{zenscorr}\\ ] ] where indices @xmath33vt and nvt refer to the respective expectation values in the grand - canonical and canonical ensembles at the same number density ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) .",
    "this term requires knowledge of an eos which is not known in advance .",
    "the correction procedure is therefore self - consistent ( we start with no correction , fit the eos , calculate the correction and better data , etc . ) , albeit rapidly converging . for @xmath37 , the accuracy of the eos",
    "is not sufficient to calculate the second derivative needed in ( [ zenscorr ] ) and we use linear extrapolation of @xmath21 in dependence on @xmath38 to zero . in a close vicinity of @xmath39",
    "even this approach fails .",
    "it was investigated in detail in @xcite that the @xmath40 dependence has an inflection point at the fluid / hexatic transition , @xmath41 as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "then the `` ensemble error '' ( of opposite sign than the ensemble correction ) becomes @xmath44 and similarly for @xmath45 ( likely with a different critical exponent @xmath46 ) .",
    "this term is positive for @xmath47 , negative for @xmath45 , and it diverges at @xmath39 . for @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "we obtain from ( [ criterr ] ) the nvt pressure by 0.005 higher than the grand - canonical one which is in qualitative agreement with the value of 0.01 by @xcite ( the statistical error is not provided , but it is likely less than 0.01 ) .",
    "the correct value of the correction may be affected by higher order terms ; apparently this must be true in a close vicinity of @xmath39 because the ensemble correction can not diverge at finite @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the `` van der waals - like '' loop @xcite is an artifact caused by suppressed density fluctuations in the constant-@xmath4 ensemble and it disappears if data are free of finite - size effects .    near the first - order phase transition ( occuring e.g.  for hard spheres ) one observes a hysteresis caused by long - lived metastable states rather than a `` loop '' ; a loop can arise at very small systems and for long runs so that an equilibrium is maintained .",
    "there is no true hysteresis near the continuous transition point , although of course the dynamics ( and convergence ) slows down .",
    "the pseudoexperimental data were fitted to a polynomial in @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the packing fraction and @xmath52 is the disk area .",
    "the compressibility factor reads as @xmath53 where @xmath54@xmath55 are determined so that virial coefficients @xmath56@xmath57 , known either analytically @xcite or ( @xmath57 @xcite ) with high precision , are exactly reproduced .",
    "parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 , are adjustable , but some of them may be zero . the number of degrees of freedom ( number of all data minus number of adjustable parameters ) is denoted @xmath60 .",
    "this choice needs some explanation .",
    "terms @xmath61 appear in several theories for both hard spheres and hard disks : the scaled particle theory @xcite , percus - yevick and hypernetted - chain integral equations @xcite , and resummation of approximated virial coefficients ( carnahan - starling equation ) @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this form is that it moderates the sharp increase of @xmath21 with increasing @xmath62 as suggested in @xcite ( equation ( 13 ) ) under name @xmath62-expansion ( function @xmath62 is here called @xmath63 and should not be confused with packing fraction  @xmath62 ) .    another popular choice is a rational function which is closely related to the pad approximant @xcite derived from a formal virial power series ; the coefficients are determined by the least - square method .",
    "there is some experience with this method in our laboratory @xcite , but detailed investigation including high densities found this method numerically unstable and less flexible ; we have not checked this approach for hard disks , though .",
    "in addition , we have theoretical objections against interpretation of the pole ( zero point of the denominator ) of such a rational function as the random close packing of the hard sphere fluid ( frozen glass ) .",
    "this interpretation assumes that the eos can be analytically continued beyond the freezing point which is not true @xcite ; it can be continued with a limited precision only  the random close packing is an inaccurate concept in principle . with increasing precision of input data this inaccuracy may cause problems in fitting . in the hard disk system",
    "it is impossible to extrapolate beyond the continuous transitions ( with inflection points on the pressure  density dependence ) to get any random close packing and even this inaccurate reason for using rational functions becomes invalid .",
    "another consequence of the nonanalyticity is that the radius of convergence of the virial series is less than or equal to the phase transition density ( first - order freezing of the hard sphere fluid or continuous transition of the hard disk fluid ) .",
    "consequently the approximately quadratic @xmath64 dependence ( for hard spheres ) and linear dependence ( for hard disks ) , related to expanded @xmath61 terms , can not extent to infinite @xmath65 .",
    "it is in principle possible to determine the radius of convergence from the sequence of @xmath66 , but the available precision and the number of terms are not sufficient",
    ".    with functional form ( [ eos ] ) , the standard objective function @xmath67 ^ 2 + \\sum_{j=6}^{10 } \\left[b_j^{\\rm eos}-b_j^{\\rm mc}\\over\\sigma(b_j^{\\rm mc})\\right]^2\\right\\ } \\label{sigma}\\ ] ] was minimized , where @xmath5 stands for the standard error , @xmath68 is the virial coefficient calculated from the eos and @xmath69 are virial mc data with standard errors @xcite . in other words , both the md data on the compressibility factor and the mc data on the virial coefficient are correlated simultaneously .",
    "the value of @xmath70 for an optimum fit is around unity provided that the input standard errors @xmath5 are reliable , which is the case of our simulations where @xmath5 is determined with accuracy ( error of error ) of a few per cent @xcite . if @xmath71 then the number of adjustable parameters is not sufficient do describe the data . on the other hand",
    ", one should not use more parameters than necessary because just noise would be fitted ; the best test is to remove one parameter and to observe whether @xmath70 significantly increases .",
    "expanding equation ( [ eos ] ) in powers of density gives virial coefficients .",
    "virial coefficients @xmath72 for @xmath73 are exactly reproduced , for @xmath74 they are modified because their change is allowed by a simultaneous fit ( within statistical errors ) , and for @xmath75 they are predicted .",
    "first , we have checked that both the virial ( [ zvir ] ) and rate ( [ zrate ] ) routes to the compressibility factor are equivalent .",
    "the differences are within combined statistical errors the same and only for two systems with @xmath76 and @xmath77 and @xmath78 slightly exceed one standard deviation .",
    "in fact , because of correlations in the data , the difference is at low and large densities much less than the combined standard error .    in order to assess the role of the periodic errors , we fitted the total correlation function @xmath79 at large separations to attenuated oscillations ,",
    "@xmath80 $ ] , where @xmath6 and @xmath81 are complex constants and re denotes the real part .",
    "the value of @xmath82 describes the decay of correlations and its typical value at simulation square size @xmath83 , @xmath84/l$ ] , is the estimate of the periodic error .",
    "we found that @xmath85 for @xmath86 . consequently the periodic error is negligible for all used @xmath4 and @xmath87 , and therefore formula ( [ zenscorr ] ) or linear @xmath88 dependence is sufficient to account for finite size effects .",
    "for @xmath89 we found @xmath90 and @xmath7 may have a small periodic error about @xmath91 ; the datum was nevertheless discarded .",
    "for @xmath92 it holds @xmath93 and even @xmath94 is barely sufficient .    for @xmath95",
    ", the data for different @xmath4 were corrected by ( [ zenscorr ] ) and a weighed average was taken ; a check was made that the corrected data do match within statistical errors . correction term ( [ zenscorr ] ) is not applicable for @xmath96 because it contains the second derivative of the eos and therefore the correction term is large and not available with sufficient precision .",
    "linear extrapolation of @xmath88 was used instead ; the final results thus cease precision .",
    "point @xmath86 is a borderline between applicability of both approaches : the ensemble correction is large and its accuracy may affect the results , but the extrapolation gives less accurate data .",
    "the final corrected md data are collected in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the data in the `` difficult '' region close to the phase transition agree well with recent extensive monte carlo data @xcite with the exception of density @xmath97 closest to @xmath39 where the @xmath98 result @xmath99 @xcite is significantly larger than our @xmath100 ; in this case one can not assume linearity of the @xmath88 dependence and our value is probably affected by higher - order finite size errors .",
    "we present three best versions differing by the maximum density @xmath101 , number of fitted parameters and the value of the objective function @xmath70 ( [ sigma ] ) , see figure  [ fig2 ] .",

    "error bars are standard errors propagated from standard errors of the md data and known virial coefficients . ]",
    "the virial coefficients were determined from a number of eoss , see figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the error of a predicted virial coefficient consists of a statistical error which is calculated from standard errors of input data and from a systematic ( method ) error .",
    "the former error ranges from typically 0.0014 ( max .",
    "0.002 ) for @xmath116 to typically 0.020.05 ( max .",
    "0.07 ) for @xmath117 to typically 0.040.2 ( max .",
    "0.4 ) for @xmath118 .",
    "the latter error is apparently difficult to determine .",
    "we believe that the range of different predictions , also those with @xmath119 , gives a certain measure the systematic error ; it also approximately matches the maximum statistical errors found in the used set od eoss .",
    "we are rather pessimistic in determining this error ; most eoss with @xmath120 ( thin lines in figure  [ fig3 ] ) give several times less scattering in the virials predicted and only moderately increased statistical errors .",
    "all virial coefficients are collected in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "[ tab2 ]    to verify the procedure , we repeated the calculations with @xmath0 removed from the second sum of ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "the predicted value was @xmath121 , which is in agreement with the direct mc datum @xcite ( and in fact more accurate ) .",
    "the `` best '' value based on all available data ( incl .",
    "@xmath0 of @xcite ) is only slightly smaller , @xmath122 .",
    "in contrast , lower - order virials are accurate enough and including the md data in the fit does not improve precision .",
    "the proposed equations of state in the fluid region combine all available information  virial coefficients and simulation compressibility data",
    ". the equations may serve in perturbation theories .",
    "they are not meant as a replacement of physically - based ( but less accurate ) equations which are able to described more phases .",
    "the equations enable prediction of higher - order virial coefficients with no additional assumption on their order - dependence .",
    "the results also witness about the `` law of complexity conservation '' : the value of the tenth virial coefficient can be obtained with comparable precision both directly by diagrammatic techniques @xcite and by simulations .    in order to obtain highly accurate md data",
    ", it was necessary to take into account finite - size effects , which is especially peculiar close to the critical fluid / hexatic point .",
