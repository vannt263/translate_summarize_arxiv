    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "we consider an optomechanical system in which a mechanical oscillator ( frequency @xmath9 ) is coupled to an electromagnetic cavity .",
    "we model the cavity mode with the annihilation operator @xmath10 and the mechanical oscillator with the displacement @xmath11 and momentum @xmath12 , or with dimensionless operators @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the mechanical zero - point fluctuation .",
    "the mechanical displacements weakly modulate the cavity resonance frequency @xmath16 and damping rate @xmath17 .",
    "we expand them to linear order to get @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the dispersive coupling constant @xmath20 and the dissipative coupling constant @xmath21 . in the general cases ,",
    "the dispersive coupling is larger than the dissipative coupling by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "however , by placing a micro - membrane inside a michelson - sagnac interferometer , it has been shown that @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be made of the same order .",
    "when the optomechanical system is driven by a strong laser with frequency @xmath25 and power @xmath26 , the hamiltonian can be written , in the rotating frame , as @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 represents the input vacuum noise . to proceed , we linearize the hamiltonian following the standard procedure by writing @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the mean values of the steady state can be calculated as @xmath33 and @xmath34 . under the effect of driving laser , the mechanical oscillator displacement @xmath35 modulates both the cavity resonance frequency and the decay rate .",
    "hence we define @xmath36 as the driving laser detuning from the effective cavity resonance frequency ; and we define @xmath37 as the effective cavity decay rate .",
    "both @xmath38 and @xmath39 depend on the power of the driving laser .",
    "however , by tuning the driving laser frequency @xmath25 , one can always cause it to be on resonance with the effective cavity frequency , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath40 . under this condition ,",
    "the effective cavity decay rate is determined by the quadratic equation @xmath41 . in the typical optomechanical systems ,",
    "the term @xmath42 is negligible compared to @xmath43 and hence @xmath44 .",
    "for example with the parameters reported in  @xcite , @xmath45 when the driving power is below @xmath46mw .",
    "then the linearized hamiltonian takes the form @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the driving field enhanced dispersive ( dissipative ) coupling constant .",
    "the form of the hamiltonian ( [ 02 ] ) suggests that it is more intuitive to write the cavity field in terms of its quadratures : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52=i$ ] . in this paper",

    "hereafter , we first focus on the on resonance driving scenario ( @xmath40 ) and then discuss the squeezing effect with detuned driving by relaxing this condition .",
    "when @xmath40 , the coupling strength @xmath57 is real .",
    "the dynamics of the system can be described using the quantum langevin equations @xmath58 here , @xmath59 models the brownian noise acting on the mechanical oscillator , and it obeys @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the mean phonon occupation number .",

    "more importantly , we notice that , due to the dissipative coupling @xmath67 , the input vacuum noise @xmath69 is also coupled directly to the mechanical motion @xmath66 . at the same time , the form of the interaction hamiltonian shows that @xmath66 interacts with the different cavity quadratures at the rates @xmath70 and @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 is fed into the system through two paths : ( i ) it directly couples to the cavity field ; and ( ii ) it couples to the mechanical motion @xmath66 dissipatively and then the optomechanical interaction transfers the noise to the cavity field .",
    "these two paths interfere in a coherent manner and lead to the fano resonance in the cavity field spectrum .",
    "we calculate the output field by combining eqs.([03])-([06 ] ) after taking the fourier transform , and find    @xmath71    where @xmath72 is the mechanical susceptibility .",
    "equations([07 ] ) and ( [ 08 ] ) describe how the input quantum noises add to the quantum fluctuation of the output fields . without optomechanical interactions , the output field preserves the input field fluctuations , _",

    "<S> the recent demonstration of cooling of a macroscopic silicon nitride membrane based on dissipative coupling makes dissipatively coupled optomechanical systems promising candidates for squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> we theoretically show that such a system in a cavity on resonance can yield good squeezing which is comparable to that produced by dispersive coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we also report the squeezing resulting from the combined effects of dispersive and dissipative couplings ; thus the device can be operated in one regime or the other . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the maximal frequency and quadrature angles needed to observe squeezing for given optomechanical coupling strengths . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the effects of temperature on squeezing . </S>"
