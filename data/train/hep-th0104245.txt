    "hamiltonian reduction @xcite , @xcite is one of the most powerful methods of constructing integrable models . in particular , the celebrated calogero - moser system can be described within this framework , both in degenarate @xcite , @xcite as well as in general elliptic case @xcite . + the general reduction scheme can be described as follows .",
    "there is a symplectic manifold @xmath0",
    "on which a lie group g acts in a symplectic way .",
    "it is assumed that this action is strongly hamiltonian .",
    "one selects a g - invariant function h on m as a hamiltonian of the dynamical system to be reduced .",
    "clearly , h has vanishing poisson brackets with all hamiltonians generating the action of g. the reduced phase space is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath1  be the lie algebra of g ; for any @xmath2   let @xmath3  denote the corresponding hamiltonian . obviously , @xmath3  is a linear function of @xmath4  , so that @xmath5  @xmath6  defines an element of @xmath7   the mapping @xmath8",
    "@xmath9  is called the momentum map . in order to define the reduced phase space one selects an element @xmath10  and",
    "consider the subset @xmath11  corresponding to @xmath12under suitable assumptions @xmath13  is a submanifold of m. however , @xmath13  is in general not sympletic : @xmath14  is degenerate .",
    "fortunately , this degeneracy can be easily characterized : let @xmath15  be a stability subgroup of @xmath16  under coadjoint action .",
    "it appears then that @xmath17  ( which , again , under some suitable assumptions is a manifold ) is symplectic , i. e. @xmath18  is nondegenerate .",
    "now , with h being g - invariant the momentum map is a constant of motion so that @xmath13  is invariant under dynamics generated by h. the essence of the method is that the trajectories on @xmath13  when projected on @xmath19  are hamiltonian , the hamiltonian function being @xmath20 +   +   +   + one can now pose the question what is the lagrangian theory behind this scheme . to answer this question",
    "let us note that we are eventually looking for is the dynamics in terms of canonical variables on @xmath19  .",
    "it is obvious that any function of these variables can be regarded as @xmath21  - invariant function on @xmath13  ( any @xmath21  invariant function on @xmath13  is constant on @xmath21  orbits so it is a function on @xmath19  ) .",
    "therefore , a given reduced trajectory on @xmath19  corresponds to an infinite set of curves on @xmath22  all of them being related to each other by the time - dependent action of @xmath23 +   +   +   + this suggests strongly that the corresponding lagrangian dynamics possess gauge symmetry related to @xmath23   + it seems that the above reasoning is fairly general , i.e. the hamiltonian reduction can be described within the framework of lagrangian gauge theory .",
    "the details of this general scheme will be published elsewhere .",
    "here we consider a particular example of ( degenerate ) calogero - moser systems @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an explicit construction of relevant gauge theory has been given by polychronakos @xcite . in order to obtain a lagrangian theory he made first the trick consisting essentially in taking @xmath24  this",
    "is achieved by viewing the value @xmath16  of momentum map as a dynamical variable transforming under g according to coadjoint representation .",
    "the advantage is that the constraint concerning the value of momentum map becomes now g - invariant , @xmath24  on the other hand the new dynamical variables do not appear in hamiltonian , so they are frozen on any particular trajectory .",
    "the reduced theory appears then to be the gauge theory with the gauge group g while the reduced dynamics corresponds to the temporal gauge .",
    "+ the aim of the present note is to construct the lagrangian dynamics for calogero - moser model without enlarging the set of dynamical variables .",
    "it is not surprising that the resulting lagrangian theory is a gauge theory with the gauge group g broken down explicilty to @xmath23   +",
    "\\(i ) + we start with a brief description of general reduction method mentioned above as applied to rational calogero - moser model @xcite . + as an unreduced phase space t one takes the set of pairs of traceless hermitian nxn matrices a and b. @xmath25 the symplectic form on t is given by @xmath26 and implies following poisson brackets @xmath27 there is a natural symplectic action of su(n ) group on t @xmath28 which generates a hamiltonian vector fields @xmath29  on t @xmath30 with hamiltonians @xmath31 \\widehat{\\zeta}),\\;\\;\\ ; \\widehat{\\zeta } \\in su(n ) \\\\\\ ] ] hence , the momentum map reads @xmath32 \\\\\\ ] ] dynamics on our unreduced phase space is defined by su(n)-invariant hamiltonian @xmath33 the element @xmath16  of su(n ) algebra and the reduced phase space @xmath19  constructed along lines sketched in the introduction read @xmath34 = \\alpha\\ } \\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ & & g_{\\alpha } = \\ { c \\in su(n ) \\;\\ ; c \\alpha c^{+ } = \\alpha \\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in other words , @xmath19  consists of pairs of matrices ( q , l ) which solve momentum map equation @xmath35and can not be related by @xmath21  action .",

    "first , @xmath53   gives , together with ( [ w20 ] ) , @xmath54 which is nothing but the momentum map condition .",
    "taking again a time derivative of ( [ w21 ] ) and using jacobi identity we arrive at @xmath55 this completes the list of constraints since @xmath56  yields @xmath57 which is a constraint for lagrange multipliers .",

    "in order to deal with the remaining ones let us denote by @xmath70   the matrix inverse to @xmath71      and define new variables which extend @xmath73  to the full canonical transformation @xmath74 the inverse transformations read @xmath75 we supply ( [ w33 ] ) with the analogous transformation for @xmath76@xmath77 inserting ( [ w33 ] ) @xmath78  ( [ w35 ] ) into the constraints @xmath79  we conclude that these constraints are equivalent to the following ones @xmath80 + @xmath81 + as always the lagrange multipliers related to second - class constraints are fixed ; here @xmath82  on the other hand the arbitrary functions entering the general solution to lagrange equations are @xmath83  consequently , @xmath84  are also arbitrary . + in order to put the theory in dirac form let us cosider first the second - class constraints .",
