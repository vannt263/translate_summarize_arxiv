    "conformal gravity ( cg ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) represents an interesting alternative gravity theory to einstein s general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "while gr has formidably passed all experimental and observational tests so far , our understanding of the composition of galaxies and of the evolution of the universe within gr is based on the assumption of the existence of dark matter and dark energy , making up 95% of the content of the universe .    like gr , cg is a completely covariant metric theory of gravity . however , cg is based on an additional symmetry principle , namely local conformal invariance .",
    "the presence of conformal symmetry inhibits both the einstein - hilbert action and a cosmological term in the action . instead",
    ", the action is defined in terms of the weyl tensor , @xmath2 being conformally invariant , the theory is sensitive to angles , but not to distances , where the conformal transformation of the metric is given by @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to gr , the gravitational coupling constant @xmath4 of cg is a dimensionless constant , making the theory power counting renormalisable .",
    "this allows to consider cg as a quantum theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "however , the cg action ( [ action ] ) leads to fourth order equations of motion , which implies the presence of ghosts .",
    "ways to eliminate these ghosts have been considered in @xcite . on the other hand , fourth order equations of motion",
    "imply more integration constants and thus solutions with more parameters .    a static sperically symmetric vacuum solution of cg with metric @xmath5 where @xmath6 was studied by mannheim and kazanas @xcite .",
    "here @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are three integration constants , where the choice @xmath10 yields the schwarzschild solution , and @xmath11 the schwarzschild - de sitter solution .",
    "thus , @xmath7 corresponds to the mass of the solution , while @xmath8 characterizes the deviation from gr .",
    "so for sufficiently small @xmath8 ( and @xmath12 ) both theories yield similar results .    on the one hand",
    ", this suggests that the newtonian limit is reproduced , and the well - known physics in the solar system is recovered . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear term will not be negligable at large distance scales , allowing to fit rotation curves of galaxies without the need for dark matter , when the parameter @xmath8 is associated with the inverse hubble length @xcite . at the same time , the constant @xmath9 acts like a cosmological constant , which , however , enters in cg only at the level of the solutions , whereas in gr it enters as part of the action .",
    "the solutions of the geodesic equations in a given spacetime provide crucial information on the spacetime .",
    "for instance , one can infer information about the properties of a black hole from the observation of the black hole shadow @xcite , one can model the inspirals of stellar mass objects towards supermassive black holes leading to gravitational waves models for extreme mass ratio inspirals ( emri ) to be observed at lisa @xcite , or model the inspiralling motion of two stellar mass black holes employing the effective one - body formalism @xcite , to find the corresponding gravitational waves models as recently observed at ligo @xcite .",
    "analytic solutions of the geodesic equations allow to precisely identify homoclinic orbits @xcite , or to test numerical codes for binary systems , etc .",
    "moreover , analytic solutions can also be of use for practical applications like geodesy .    in 1931",
    "hagihara @xcite solved the geodesic equations in a schwarzschild gravitational field , where he applied the elliptic weierstrass function .",
    "the solutions for the kerr and kerr - newman spacetimes have the same mathematical structure @xcite and can be solved analogously . the mathematical method to solve the hyperelliptic equations of motion in the schwarzschild-(anti ) de sitter spacetime",
    "is based on the solution of the jacobi inversion problem restricted to the @xmath13-divisor @xcite .",
    "also these more advanced methods were applied to obtain solutions of the geodesic equations in various spacetimes ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the geodesic equations were solved analytically in the spacetimes of @xmath14 gravity , btz and gmghs black holes @xcite .    here , we are interested in the geodesic equations of cg spacetimes . for the description of the motion of stars and gas in galaxies ,",
    "timelike geodesics should be considered , in principle , though basically newtonian dynamics has been applied in this case @xcite .",
    "timelike geodesics in the static spherically symmetric cg metric ( [ metric0 ] ) have been calculated to determine the perihelion shift of the planets in the solar system @xcite , where the effect of the linear term in the metric has suggested a constraint for the integration constant @xmath8 .",
    "another recent calculation of timelike geodesics @xcite has employed the rotating generalization of the cg metric ( [ metric0 ] ) @xcite .",
    "exploiting separability it has addressed the flyby anomaly in this cg spacetime .",
    "we note that applicability and interpretation of the geodesic equations and their solutions has remained a matter of debate for cg , including considerations , that only null geodesics are physically meaningful in cg , since they do not involve a mass scale , while various amendments have been suggested for the desciption of massive particles ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    in this paper , we discuss the geodesic motion of test particles and light in a conformal cylindrically symmetric spacetime obtained in @xcite .",
    "it represents a cg generalization of the ads black string metric obtained in gr by lemos @xcite ( for earlier work see @xcite ) .",
    "we here present the results in terms of weierstrass elliptic functions and derivatives of kleinian sigma functions .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : first , in sec .",
    "[ cg ] we give a brief review of the field equations in cg , and review some general properties of the cylindrical spacetime . in sec .",
    "[ ge ] we present the geodesic equations for this spacetime . in sec .  [ as ]",
    ", we derive the analytical solution of the equations of motions and describe test particle motion in this spacetime .",
    "we exhibit a set of possible orbits in sec .",
    "[ o ] and conclude in sec .",
    "the main element of cg is the substitution of the einstein - hilbert action with the weyl action ( [ action ] ) based on the weyl tensor @xmath15 , @xmath16 defined as the totally traceless part of the riemann tensor .",
    "the cg field equations are similar to the einstein equations , where the source term on the right - hand side is given by the energy - momentum tensor @xmath17 , while on the left - hand side the bach tensor @xmath18 @xmath19 replaces the einstein tensor , leading to @xmath20 in vacuum , the right - hand side vanishes .",
    "static and stationary cg solutions were investigated in detail in @xcite .",
    "the case of static cylindrically symmetric solutions was studied by brihaye and verbin @xcite and subsequently by said _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "here we consider the static cylindrically symmetric vacuum metric as given in @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 was derived by solving eq .",

    ", we briefly recall the ads black string solution of lemos @xcite , which has the metric function @xmath22 , @xmath24 here @xmath25 is related to the negative cosmological constant @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is proportional to the mass , @xmath28 .",
    "clearly , setting @xmath11 in the cg expression ( [ metrics ] ) , we recover the gr result ( [ lemosm ] ) for @xmath29    the metric ( [ metrics ] ) possesses horizons when @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to gr , the sign of @xmath26 is not predetermined here .",
    "so for positive @xmath26 also a cosmological horizon may be present . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , also regular spacetimes are among the possible set of solutions . unfortunately , however , the gauge chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite makes a direct comparison of the solutions unfeasible .",
    "this also holds for the solutions of the null geodesics presented in ref .",
    "in this section , we derive the equations of motion for test particles and light .",
    "the geodesic motion in such a spacetime of eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) is described by @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the christoffel symbols .",

    "for null geodesics the solutions are given in terms of the elliptic weierstrass @xmath0-function .",
    "the case of timelike geodesics is more complicated , here the equations are of hyperelliptic type and the kleinian @xmath1 function is needed to solve the equations .      with the dimensionless quantities , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , eq .",

    "( [ rtild ] ) implies that @xmath54 is a necessary condition for the existence of a geodesic .",
    "we also observe that @xmath55 , where the singularity is located , is a zero of @xmath56 for all values of the parameters .",

    "the analytic solutions of this paper can be used to calculate the exact orbits and their properties .",
    "furthermore , observables like the periastron shift of bound orbits or the light deflection of escape orbits could be calculated .",
    "also it would be interesting to use the analytical solutions to study the shadow of a static cylindrically symmetric black hole in conformal gravity .",
