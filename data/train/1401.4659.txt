    "a close observation of the table shows the superiority of frdm over sei or nl3 for lighter mass of the superheavy nuclei .",
    "in contrast to the lighter region , the sei predicts better results for heavier isotopes .",
    "for example , binding energy of @xmath91 is 2056.80 @xmath92 in sei , whereas the values are 2064.87 , 2071.04 and 2066.06 @xmath92 in rmf(nl3 ) , frdm and experiment ( or systematics ) , respectively .",
    "based on this trend , one can expect that the prediction of sei gives us better insight about the magic structures of superheavy nuclei in heavier mass region , which is the main objective of the present investigation .",
    "after convinced with the binding energy of the superheavy nuclei , we present the density distribution of protons and neutrons in figure 1 .",
    "the densities are compared with the rmf(nl3 ) calculations . in general , the rmf and sei densities are almost similar with each other .",
    "however , a proper inspection reveals that the sei densities slightly over estimate the rmf(nl3 ) densities .",
    "this overestimation is mostly at the middle region of the nucleus .",
    "the humps at the central region for both the densities show shell effect for all nuclei shown in the figure .      from the binding energy",

    "the @xmath88 for all the four isotopic chains are shown in fig .",
    "2 as a function of neutron number . in case of pb isotopes ,",
    "the sudden decrease of @xmath88 at neutron number _ n_=126 , is the well known neutron magic number for the largest known _ z_=82 magic nucleus .",
    "the analysis is extended to the recently predicted proton magic numbers like z=114 , 120 and 126 , which are currently under scrutiny for their confirmation .",
    "it is important to mention that , the next proton magic number beyond _ z_=82 would be _ z_=126 considering the traditional proton and neutron and neutron magic numbers for known closed shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , several microscopic calculations @xcite suggest a shift of this number to 114 .",
    "one of the cause of the shift is the coulomb effect on the spherical single particle levels .",
    "the use of shell correction by v. m. strutinsky @xcite to the liquid - drop calculation of binding energy ( be ) opens a more satisfactory exploration towards the search of double closed nucleus beyond @xmath5pb . using this approach , _",
    "z_=114 is supported to be the proton magic after 82 @xcite , which was regarded as the magic number in the superheavy valley @xcite with _ n_=184 as the corresponding neutron magic number .",
    "however , the recent relativistic mean field calculations using various force parameters @xcite , predict _ z_=120 as the next magic number with _ n_=172/182 as the neutron closed shell .",
    "contrary to all these predictions , some non relativistic calculations report _ z_=126 as the next magic proton in the superheavy valley .",
    "the microscopic calculations using skyrme hartree - fock formalism predict _ n_=182 as the next neutron closed shell after n=126 , which differs by 2 unit from other predictions@xcite .    analyzing the @xmath88 energy for the isotopic chain of _ z_=82 , 114 , 120 , 126 , the sharp fall of @xmath88 at _",
    "n_=126 is a clear evidence of magic combination of _ z_=82 and _ n_=126 . our newly developed sei model and previously existing nl3 follow the same trend as experiment .",
    "but whenever we analyzed the plots of _ z_=114 , 120 , 126 find a slight difference in two models ( sei and rmf ) . in rmf(nl3 ) , when we go from one magic neutron number to the next one , the @xmath88 energy suddenly decreases to a lower value , which reflect in fig .",
    "2 . in sei ,",
    "the @xmath88 energy follows same pattern but the magnitude of decreseness some how less .      another important quantity , which helps us to locate the closed shell is the pairing gaps of proton and neutron in a constant force bcs calculation . here , we calculate the pairing gap for the isotopic chain of _ z_=82 , 114 , 120 and 126 and locate the minimum values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the results are depicted in figures 3 and 4 and also compared with the rmf(nl3 ) force .",
    "it is well known that nl3 force satisfies this criteria for the location of magicity @xcite .",
    "although , sei overestimates the paring gaps of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , the trend for both nl3 and sei are found to be similar .",
    "consistence with nl3 results as well as with earlier calculations with a variety of force parameters , our present sei reproduces minima at _ n_=182/184 and _ z_=120 and to some extent at _ z_=114 .    to see the trend of pairing energy @xmath68 at the discussed neutron number _ n_=184 , we plot @xmath68 as a function of neutron number n in figure 5 .",
    "surprisingly , we get almost zero pairing energy at n=126 for _ z_=82 isotopic case .",
    "the formalism is extended to _",
    "z_=114 , 120 and 126 cases .",
    "we find minimum or zero @xmath68 at _",
    "n_=182/184 confirming the earlier predictions of this neutron magic number at",
    "= 182/184 @xcite.qualitatively , the sei interaction follows the trend of rmf(nl3 ) as shown in fig 5 , but fails when we have a quantitative estimation .",
    "for example , the @xmath94 or @xmath68 at _",
    "n_=182/184 is minimum but has a finite value unlike to the nl3 prediction . as a matter of fact",
    ", the validity of pairing scheme to this region of nuclei may not be 100 % applicable .",
    "the importance of pairing is needed to keep the value of @xmath96 and @xmath95 zero at the appropriate magic number .",
    "it is to be noted that one can find similar information about the stability of a nucleus either from the chemical potential or the nucleon separation energy .",
    "however , the neutron or proton separation energies are obtained from the binding energy , whereas the chemical potential ( both for proton and neutron ) calculated self - consistently while solving the field equations . to see the consistency between these two observables ( @xmath97 or @xmath98 ; @xmath99=@xmath100 ) , we have analyzed these quantities separately in the present paper . for a bound nucleus",
    ", both the chemical potentials of protons @xmath101 and neutrons @xmath89 must be negative . to realize the relative stability from chemical point of view",
    ", we have plotted @xmath101 and @xmath89 with neutron number in fig .",
    "the results are also compared with the @xmath102value of nl3 set . in both the cases ,",
    "we find similar chemical potential . in some previous papers",
    "it was suggested that we can take _ n_=172 as magic number for neutron .",
    "but our sei model show that the combination _ z_=120 and _ n_=172 is strictly not allowed .",
    "because in this case @xmath103 mev , which gives proton instability .",
    "however nl3 result shows this combination is a loosely bound system having @xmath104 mev and @xmath105 mev . although the be / a curve show a local maximum at _ z_=114 and n=172 in sei model , we can not take this as a stable system because of @xmath94 and @xmath95 value , which does not shows any signature of stability .",
    "the sei model gives a clear picture that the isotope @xmath106 be , a suitable combination for the next double closed nucleus .",
    "one can justify it by analysis of be / a data of @xmath106 .",
    "for example @xmath107 mev which create a local maxima in its neighbor hood for @xmath106 . in the same time , the optimum negative value of chemical potential energies of @xmath89and @xmath101 gives a sign of maximum stability . a similar analysis of numerical data for @xmath101 of isotopes of _",
    "z_=126 shows that there is no reason of taking _",
    "z_=126 and _ n_=182/184 as a stable combination .",
    "this is because of the positive value of @xmath101 ( 1.36 ) mev .",
    "the single particle energies for @xmath108120 with nl3 and sei for proton and neutron are shown in fig 7 .",
    "the single particle solutions are obtained without including the pairing correlation into account to intact the degeneracy of the levels .",
    "the calculation of single particle energies of sei with pairing shows that the degeneracy of the energy levels are not invariant .",
    "the basic cause of this discrepancy is the over estimation of our pairing strength in sei model which may be an interesting analysis for pairing in future .",
    "the filling up single particle energy levels for neutrons in sei with pairing is different from that of without pairing .",
    "the energy levels without pairing are given by [ 178 ] @xmath109 , @xmath110 while the same with pairing are [ 178 ] @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "that means an empty orbital is created at 4@xmath114 and occupied in 1@xmath115 .",
    "we have also analyzed the single particle levels for @xmath116120 , which is not given in the figure . from the anatomy of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , we find large gaps at neutron number _ n_=184 and proton number _ z_=120 .",
    "the value of neutron gap at _ n_=184 is 1.949 @xmath92 and that of proton is 1.275 @xmath92 for the last occupied and first unoccupied nucleon .",
    "on the other hand the neutron and proton gap for @xmath116120 are respectively @xmath119 and @xmath120@xmath121 .",
    "the above data say the energy gaps for the neutron and proton in @xmath108120 are greater than the gap in @xmath116120 .",
    "this give us an indication to take the combination _ n_=184 and _ z_=120 as the next magic nucleus . from the analysis of single particle energy level of @xmath108120 with nl3 parameter set",
    "one can see the neutron and proton gaps are @xmath122 mev and @xmath123 mev respectively for the last occupied and first unoccupied nucleon .",
    "the rmf(nl3 ) and sei data are comparable with each other .",
    "in summery , we have calculated binding energy @xmath88 energy , single particle levels , pairing gaps and chemical potential , in the isotopic chain of _ z_=82 , 114 , 120 and 126 .",
    "all our calculations are done in the frame work of sei interaction .",
    "we have compared our results with standard rmf(nl3 ) interaction . over",
    "all discussion and analysis of all possible evidences of shell closure property show that , one can take _ z_=120 and _ n_=182 as the next magic combination beyond @xmath124 and @xmath125 , which is different from skyrme , gogny , rmf(nl3 ) by two unit . however on the basis of single particle energy levels , the preferred gap is at _ n_=184 which is consistent with these ( skyrme , gogny and rmf ) force parameters .",
    "this happens due to the overestimation of pairing strength .",
    "as we only use sei interaction to predict the magic nuclei , so it is out of scope of our status to change its original pairing strength .",
    "we can just make a comments to this observation and left for further study .",
