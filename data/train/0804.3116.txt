    "when eugene garfield published his 1972 paper in _ science _ describing the role of impact factor in bibliometric studies , he provided a table of the highest - impact journals in science based on 1969 data . at that time , only 7 journals had impact factors of 10 or higher , and _ science _",
    "itself had an impact factor of 3.0 @xcite .",
    "thirty five years later , in 2006 , 109 journals have impact factors of 10 or higher , and _ science _ registers an impact factor of 30.0 @xcite . over the period from 1994 , to 2005 , the average impact factor of all journals indexed by journal citations reports increased by about 2.6 percent per year .",
    "average impact factors differ not only over time , but across fields .",
    "for example , in 2006 the highest impact factor in the field of economics is 4.7 , held by the review journal _ journal of economic literature_. the top impact factor in molecular and cell biology is 47.4 , held by _ annual reviews of immunology_. the average impact factors in these fields differ sixfold : the average impact factor in economics it is 0.8 whereas the average in molecular and cell biology is 4.8 .",
    "this paper explores the sources of the increase in impact factor over the past 15 years , and the reasons for impact differences across fields .",
    "citation and article counts were obtained from the cd - rom version of the thomson journal citation reports ( jcr ) science and social science editions , for the years 19942005 .",
    "a journal s impact factor is a measure of the number of times that articles published in a census period cite articles published during an earlier target window .",
    "the impact factor as reported by thomson scientific has a one year census period and uses the two previous years for the target window .",
    "stated more formally , let @xmath0 be the number of times in year @xmath1 that the year @xmath2 and @xmath3 volumes of journal @xmath4 are cited .",
    "let @xmath5 be the number of articles that appear in journal @xmath4 in year @xmath1 .",
    "the impact factor @xmath6 of journal @xmath4 in year @xmath1 is    @xmath7      the jcr database includes 4,300 journals that were indexed continually from 1994 to 2005 .",
    "for these journals , figure 1a plots 1994 impact factor scores against 2005 scores .",
    "points above the diagonal represent journals with impact factor that have risen , and points below represent journals with impact factors that have fallen .",
    "about 80 % of the journals have increased in impact factor over the eleven years .",
    "figure 1b shows the rank - order distribution of impact factors for years 1994 ( lighter blue ) through 2005 ( darker blue ) .",
    "impact factors scores increase annually , predominantly through the midrange of the distribution . from these figures , it is apparent that impact factors have increased steadily for most journals , independently of their initial impact factors .",
    "to measure average rate of change , it is appropriate to assign larger weights to journals that publish more articles .",
    "the most convenient formulation assigns weights proportional to the number of articles that a journal published during the target years .",
    "let @xmath5 be the number of articles published by journal @xmath4 in year @xmath1 and let @xmath8 be the sum of the articles published over the set @xmath9 of all journals indexed in year @xmath1 .",
    "we define the weight for journal @xmath4 in year @xmath1 as @xmath10 notice that @xmath11 .",
    "define the weighted average impact factor as @xmath12    the weighted average impact factor for all journals listed in the jcr increased by an average rate of 2.6% percent per year from 1994 to 2005 . for the journals that appeared in the index throughout the entire period from 1994 through 2005 , the average annual increase was 1.6% .",
    "it might seem appealing to simply attribute the growth of impact factor to the growth of the scientific enterprise and in particular to the growth in the number of articles indexed by the jcr .",
    "the raw numbers lend a superficial plausibility to this view . from 1994 to 2005 , the number of articles in jcr - indexed journals increased by 28% and the weighted impact factor increased by 29% . but with a moment s reflection , we see that the connection is not immediate . for any given article ,",
    "an increase in the number of related articles is a source of additional chances to be cited , but it is also a source of additional competition for the attention of potential readers and citations . we will show that a constant rate of growth of the number of indexed articles will not result in increasing impact factors unless the number of citations per article also increases .",
    "we have found a useful way to decompose the average impact factor in any period into the product of four factors . these are    1 .   the number of articles listed in the jcr , as measured by the ratio of number of articles published in the census period to the number of articles published in the target window .",
    "2 .   the average number of citations in the reference list of each published article . 3 .",
    "the fraction of all citations from articles written in the census period that cite articles published within the target window of the two prior years .",
    "the fraction of cited articles published within the target window that appear in journals indexed by the jcr .",
    "we construct this decomposition as follows .",
    "let @xmath13 be the average number of papers cited by the journals in our dataset ( i.e. , the jcr - indexed journals ) in year @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the fraction of citations in our dataset in year @xmath1 that go to papers published in years @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the fraction of those citations appearing in our dataset in year @xmath1 and referencing items published in years @xmath2 and @xmath3 , that go to journals that are listed in the jcr ( as opposed to working papers , conference proceedings , books , journals not listed in the jcr , etc . ) .",
    "recalling our notation from section [ sec : quantifying ] , @xmath16 and @xmath17    if we define @xmath18 , the weighted average impact factor at time @xmath1 can be written as the product @xmath19    the growth rate of a variable is approximated by the change in the logarithm of that variable .",
    "the multiplicative form of equation ( [ product ] ) makes it easy to decompose the growth rate of the average impact factor into the sum of growth rates of the variables @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ product ] ) that @xmath24    where for any variable @xmath25 , we define @xmath26 . from the jcr data we are able to determine @xmath27 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and hence @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "our methods for doing so are described in appendix [ appendix : methods ] .",
    "the results are reported in tables [ table : acpv ] and [ table : rhoacpv ] .",

    "impact factors vary across fields and over time . by decomposing average impact factors into four contributing components",
    " field growth , average number of cited items per paper , fraction of citations to papers published within two years , and fraction of citations to jcr - listed items  we are able to determine the sources of this variation . we find that an increasing number of citations in the reference lists of published papers is the greatest contributor to impact factor inflation over time .",
    "differences in the fraction of citations to jcr - indexed literature is the greatest contributor to differences across fields , though cross - field differences in impact factor are also influenced by differences in the number of citations per paper and differences in the fraction of references that were published within two years .",
    "by contrast , the growth rate of the scientific literature and cross - field differences in net size and growth rate have very little influence on impact factor inflation or on cross - field differences in impact factor .",
    "the authors are the developers of eigenfactor ( ` http://www.eigenfactor.org ` ) , a method for ranking journal influence using citation network data .",
    "the authors would like to thank martin rosvall for generating the maps used in figure [ maps ] , and also alan wilson for drawing out attention to impact factor inflation .",
    "this work was supported in part by a mary gates research scholarship and a howard hughes medical institute integrative research internship to b.m.a .",
    "all citation data sets come from the jcr data sets for the years 1994 through 2005 .",
    "the jcr does not list article counts for year @xmath1 in data set for year @xmath1 ; the year @xmath32 and year @xmath33 data sets typically do not agree exactly on the number of articles that were published in year @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , in order to compute the the year @xmath1 article count , a@xmath34 , we average the article count listed for year @xmath1 in the @xmath32 data set and year @xmath1 in the @xmath33 data set .",
    "we then calculate @xmath35 using the total article counts for years @xmath36 and @xmath37 as given in the data set for year @xmath1 .",
    "we calculate @xmath14 by dividing the total outgoing citations for all journals to material published in the previous two years ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) by the total outgoing citations for all journals in year @xmath1 : @xmath39    the calculation of @xmath15 is slightly more complicated than the other calculations ; figure [ vdiagram ] provides a schematic representation . to calculate the percentage of citations into the jcr for the entire dataset we divide the total _ incoming _ citations for the previous two years ( figure [ vdiagram ] , top panel , arrow a ) by the total outgoing citations over that period ( arrows a + c ) :      this is done because the incoming citations for the entire dataset are the outgoing citations from the jcr to itself .",
    "however , this is not true for the specific field calculations . to calculate @xmath41 for any field @xmath42",
    ", we divide the 2-year outgoing citations from that field to itself ( figure [ vdiagram ] , bottom panel , arrow a ) plus the 2-year outgoing citations from that field to the rest of the jcr ( arrow b ) by the total 2-year outgoing citations from that field ( arrows a + b + c ) :                    h.f .",
