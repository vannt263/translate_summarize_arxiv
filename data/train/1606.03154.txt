    "for example , the decrease of ice at arctic sea in the summer of 2007 ( event @xmath0 , @xmath6 ) is considered to be responsible for the heavy freezing rain in winter 2008 in southern china ( event @xmath1 , @xmath7)@xcite . the strong el nino event occurred in 1997 ( event @xmath0 ) induced the heavy yangtze river flooding in 1998 ( event @xmath8)@xcite . in the communication field , in order to safely get information from alice ( event @xmath0 )",
    ", bob should have a private key @xmath3 such that he can find the thing he wants ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is reported that the event @xmath1 , the detection of a signal of gravitational wave , is due to the event @xmath0 , the merging of two black holes from 1.3 billion light years away@xcite ; in quantum physics , many faraway particles ( atoms ) may construct a completely entangled state , a measurement of one particle ( event @xmath0 ) will affect the state of the other ( event @xmath2)@xcite .",
    "traditionally , physical models are locally established around a single space - time point , say , @xmath9 . to describe the correlated events happened in two or more places , one has to establish some kinds of new physically significant models . in this paper , we restrict ourselves to study only two - place physical models , alice - bob ( ab ) models for simplicity .",
    "we say alice - bob physics if the physics is related to two correlated / entangled events occurred in two places @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "the event at @xmath9 is called alice event ( ae ) ( denoted by @xmath11 ) and the event at @xmath10 is called bob event ( be ) ( denoted by @xmath12 ) .",
    "the events ae and be are called correlated / entangled if ae happens , the be can be determined at once by the correlation condition @xmath13 for suitable operator(s ) @xmath3 .",
    "usually , @xmath10 is not neighbour to @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the intrinsic two - place models , the alice - bob systems ( abss ) , are nonlocal .",
    "some special types of two - place nonlocal models have been proposed , say , the nonlocal nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation ( called also pt symmetric nls equation ) , @xmath14 was firstly proposed by ablowitz and musslimani@xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the usual parity and charge conjugation .",
    "some types of other nonlocal nonlinear systems such as the coupled nonlocal nls systems @xcite , the nonlocal modified kdv systems @xcite , the discrete nonlocal nls system @xcite and the nonlocal davey - stewartson systems@xcite were also proposed .",
    "though the nonlocal nls and the other known models mentioned above have been studied by many authors , they are all proposed in the mathematical way from the integrability requirement without any possible physical applications .    in this paper , we attempt to provide a possible physical application : they are special ab systems and can be possibly used to describe some special types of ab physics . in section 2 , we discuss the general aspect of the ab systems via shifted parity and the delayed time reversal . in section 3 , the detailed group invariant solutions for general ab - kdv systems and symmetry breaking solutions for a special ab - kdv system",
    "are studied .",
    "the multiple soliton solutions of the usual integrable systems have been applied in almost all the physical fields and there are some types of formally different complicated expressions such as the hirota forms , determinant forms , pffafion forms and so on @xcite . here , a much more elegant form of the solutions for the kdv type systems is presented . in section 4 , a special ab - kdv system is derived from a rotating fluid system via multiple scale method .",
    "a symmetry breaking soliton solution of the special kdv system is applied to a two - atmospheric - blocking - events which is related to the heavy snow disaster in the winter of 2007/2008 in the south of china .",
    "the last section is a summary and discussion .",
    "there exist two possible ways to establish abss which may be used to describe ab physics in the future .",
    "( i ) . the first way is to solve out two events ae and be from traditional basic principle equation(s ) , @xmath17 by assuming @xmath18 for suitable @xmath19 , where @xmath20 may be a scalar , a vector ,  a matrix or a tensor .",
    ". may be arbitrarily known principle systems , say , the navier - stokes ( ns ) equation for ab fluid problems , the maxwell system for electro - meganetic - optic ab problems , the schrdinger equation in quantum physics , the einstein s equation for the gravitational ab problems and the various types of their generating models such as the korteweg de - vrise ( kdv ) equation , the nls equation , the kadomtsev - petviashvilli ( kp ) equation and so on .",
    "if the original principle system is classical , then the derived ab systems should also be classical .",
    "meanwhile , if is a quantum system , say the schrdinger equation or dirac equation , the derived ab systems are naturally quantum .",
    "( ii ) . the second way is to establish or derive new models by introducing suitable correlated / entangled conditions for known coupled systems , for instance , the nonlocal nls system obtained by ablowitz and musslimani @xcite is just derived from a coupled system , the ablowitz - kaup - newell - segue ( akns ) system .",
    "more examples of ab systems derived from coupled equations have been offered in the preprint paper @xcite .    to find out some concrete results , we introduce a principle @xcite , the ab - ba equivalence principle , which requires @xmath21 and",
    "@xmath22 substituting the two event assumption into the original principle and splitting the resulting equation to two , we may have @xmath23 two equations of should be reduced back to one equation because of the correlated condition . to reduce two equations of to one",
    "we can apply the operator @xmath3 on one of them .",
    "the results should be @xmath24 with the condition .",
    "generally , there are infinitely many solutions of @xmath25 . for instance",
    ", any solution of @xmath26 for arbitrary two - dimensional function @xmath27 solves @xmath25 if we express @xmath28 . for linear transformations of @xmath4 variables @xmath29 , the superscription @xmath30 of a matrix means the transposition of the matrix , we have the following theorem and conjecture . + * theorem . _",
    "the linear transformation @xmath31 possesses the solution @xmath32 where @xmath33 is related to all the possible permutations of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are arbitrary @xmath37 ,  @xmath38 and @xmath39 matrices , respectively , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are @xmath42 and @xmath43 unit matrices .",
    "+ * conjecture .",
    "all solutions of have the form . +",
    "the theorem can be simply proved by checking the condition @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the conjecture has been directly checked for @xmath46 in @xcite .",
    "we believe the conjecture is also true for @xmath47 .",
    "( ii ) . for @xmath48 ,",
    "@xmath49 the transformation is a trivial identity transformation . for @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath49 the transformation is a shifted parity transformation for all variables @xmath51 .",
    "because any similarity transformation @xmath52 is also a solution of , the conjecture implies that the solution is similarity transformation invariant up to redefinition of the arbitrary matrices @xmath35 and @xmath36 . * * _ *",
    "to make it more clear , we take the well known kdv equation @xcite @xmath53 as a simple example .    the kdv equation was first introduced by boussinesq @xcite and rediscovered by diederik korteweg and gustav de vries @xcite .",
    "the kdv equation has various connections to physical problems .",
    "it approximately describes the evolution of long , one - dimensional waves in many physical settings , including shallow - water waves with weakly non - linear restoring forces , long internal waves in a density - stratified ocean , ion acoustic waves in a plasma , acoustic waves on a crystal lattice@xcite and the 2-dimensional quantum gravity@xcite .",
    "the kdv equation can be solved using the inverse scattering transform and other methods such as those applied to other integrable systems @xcite .    furthermore , for simplicity , we take the symmetric @xmath19 as a simplest form @xmath54 . from the equation ,",
    "it is clear that the kdv equation is parity - time reversal invariant , space - time translation invariant and complex conjugate invariant .",
    "thus , we can take @xmath3 as @xmath55 for the real kdv system and @xmath56 for the complex kdv equation , where @xmath57 is a shifted parity defined by @xmath58 , @xmath59 is a delayed time reversal defined by @xmath60 , and @xmath16 is the usual charge conjugate .    substituting @xmath54 into the kdv equation , we have @xmath61 which can be split to two equations @xmath62 where @xmath63 may be an arbitrary functional of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . applying @xmath3 defined in eq .",
    "on eq . will lead to a compatibility condition @xmath64 in other words , @xmath63 is not an arbitrary functional but an arbitrary @xmath3 invariant functional .    finally , we obtain a quite general nonlocal ab - kdv system @xmath65 or @xmath66 with an arbitrary @xmath3 invariant functional @xmath63 .",
    "it is known that the original kdv equation is a famous integrable model . however , the integrability of the ab - kdv system is not very clear because the introduction of the arbitrary @xmath3 invariant functional @xmath63 though there are some different formal lax pairs .",
    "the first formal lax pair possesses the form , @xmath67 where @xmath68_x , \\ \\phi=(a - b)_x\\partial_x^{-1}+2(a - b)+\\partial_x^2,\\ ] ] and @xmath69 is just the recursive operator of the classical kdv equation with the potential @xmath70 .",
    "if the arbitrary @xmath3 invariant functional @xmath71 is fixed , one may obtain more concrete lax pairs , say , if we select @xmath72 the related ab - kdv systems are just @xmath73 listed in @xcite .",
    "the ab - kdv systems with the conditions can be considered as special reductions of the coupled kdv system derived from two - layer fluid systems @xcite .",
    "in addition to the ab - kdv system , there are other types of ab - kdv systems which can not be directly solved out from the kdv equation . for instance",
    ", the following ab - kdv system @xmath74 can be obtained from the reduction of coupled kdv systems , say , the hirota - satsuma system @xcite .",
    "the lax pair of the ab - kdv system can be directly read out from that of the hirota - satsuma system ( where @xmath75 ) @xcite .",
    "the most general real ab - kdv systems may have the more general form @xmath76 with the condition @xmath77 where @xmath78 is defined in eq . .",
    "now a natural question is how to solve the ab - kdv systems listed in this paper . to solve complicated nonlinear systems , the symmetry methods play essential roles .",
    "in fact , the powerful darboux and bcklund transformations are essentially special symmetry approaches @xcite .",
    "usually , one uses continuous symmetries to find group invariant solutions of nonlinear systems .",
    "here we have derived many ab - systems by using discrete symmetries , the shifted parity and the delayed time reversal .",
    "thus it is interesting that if we can find some nontrivial shifted parity and delayed time reversal invariant solutions for all the ab - kdv systems .",
    "the group invariant condition @xmath79 implies that to look for the @xmath80 invariant solutions of the ab - kdv systems is equivalent to find the @xmath80 invariant solutions of the usual kdv equation .    for nonlinear systems ,",
    "soliton excitations are most important exact solutions . for the kdv equation ,",
    "its well known multiple soliton solutions possesses the form @xcite @xmath81 where the summation of @xmath82 should be done for all permutations of @xmath83 and @xmath84    it is clear that the solution is not @xmath80 invariant .",
    "the reason is that the kdv equation is space - time translation invariant and then every soliton of the kdv equation can be located at anywhere @xmath85 . however , the ab - kdv is space - time translation symmetry breaking .",
    "thus we have to fix the arbitrary constants @xmath85 such that the multiple soliton solution is @xmath80 invariant but not the space - time translation symmetry invariant .    after finishing some detailed calculations",
    ", we find that if we rewrite @xmath86 as @xmath87 the soliton solution of the kdv equation can be equivalently rewritten as @xmath88_{xx},\\label{sola1ch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation of @xmath89 should be done for all permutations of @xmath90 , and @xmath91    now , it is straightforward to see that @xmath92 solves all the ab - kdv system including eqs . and .",
    "similarly , all the @xmath80 invariant solutions of the kdv equation are also solutions of all ab - kdv systems . here",
    "we list two more examples , the painlev ii reduction and the soliton - cnoidal periodic wave interaction solutions .",
    "the @xmath80 invariant painlev ii reduction possesses the form , @xmath93 where @xmath94 satisfies @xmath95 which is equivalent to the painlev ii equation .",

    "it should be also emphasized that though we have obtained many @xmath3 invariant solutions for many models , there are various other solutions which are @xmath3 symmetry breaking .",
    "usually , @xmath3 symmetry breaking solutions may not be same for different models .",

    "this implies that we can introduce useful nonlinearities from useful nonlocal nonlinear symmetry invariant constraints . in the reference @xcite , one of us , lou ,",
    "prove that various physically important nonlinear systems ( such as kdv , kp , nls , sine - gordon etc . )",
    "can be derived from linear systems by means of this types of nonlinear and nonlocal constraints .",
    "it is also indicated that there are infinitely many nonlocal physical functional models which have not yet been studied by present physics and lack of effective methods to solve nonlocal and nonlinear functional physical models .",
    "this fact arouses many challenges to the present physical society .",
    "though the multiple soliton solutions for many integrable systems have been obtained in some types of formally different complicated expressions , in this paper , a much more elegant form for the kdv type systems is proposed .",
    "the similar elegant forms for many other types of soliton systems can also be obtained@xcite by using the same approach .",
    "in addition to the beauty of the new soliton expressions , our forms display two new physical phenomena .",
    "the first one is that the resonant soliton solution is analytical when the wave numbers @xmath158 , and @xmath159 are very closed to each other , however , it is not analytical for the traditional multiple soliton expressions when resonance happens .",
    "the second one is that if we take the positions of the solitons are wave numbers dependent , then we may obtain various types of quite different resonant solutions which need to be further explored in future .",
