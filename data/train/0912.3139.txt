    "the study of complex systems with interacting agents is of great interest in very many fields ranging from physics through quantitative biology to economics @xcite .",
    "modelling the dynamics of interacting species should capture the competition between the species for growth and survival , which underlies all evolutionary dynamics .",
    "one of the most famous models of this class is the lotka - volterra model used for studying predator - prey interactions @xcite , which is loosely predicated on the principle of the survival of the fittest @xcite .",
    "typically , little attention has been paid to the case where agents interact through an active medium ; this is a case where the lotka - volterra model can not be simply applied .",
    "a very recent study @xcite on microbial populations strongly suggests that the interactions between the individuals in the population occur through an active nutrient pool .",
    "for instance , in the case of interacting traders , a central exchange or reserve bank could represent such an active medium ; this could selectively deplete or enrich individuals depending on taxation modes in the system .",
    "our present study is based on such an example @xcite ; the detailed model of competing clusters on which it is based @xcite , forms the basis of our study here .",
    "the term ` cluster ' is used throughout this paper to refer a single coarse grained macroscopic unit that is a collection of numerous small microscopic subunits .",
    "the magnitude of such a cluster is characterized by its absolute mass .    beginning with the appearance of two seminal papers @xcite ,",
    "the study of complex networks has attracted phenomenal attention from diverse fields .",
    "the spur in the growth of these studies began primarily with the prospect that numerous systems in nature can be compartmentalized into highly interconnected entities of dynamical units . to quote a few of the numerous examples that have a complex network topology : the internet , social interactions , biological metabolic networks , predator - prey interactions in food chains , etc ( see @xcite ) .",
    "many real world networks , in spite of their inherent differences , have been found to have complex network topology , for example : social @xcite and biological networks @xcite .",
    "predator - prey interactions seen in food webs and ecological networks are of special importance to our present study . of the numerous studies done on food webs , some of them have a small world structure @xcite , while some other studies suggest that the food webs do not show either a small world or a scale - free topology but may have a different network structure @xcite .",
    "while the exact form of the structure of a predator - prey system is subjective , the nature of the interaction has been shown to be highly nonlinear and therefore can be modelled mathematically @xcite .    in the light of the above studies",
    ", it is becoming increasingly clear that interactions between agents are neither of the mean field type , where all of the species interact with all others , nor necessarily confined to local neighbourhoods .",
    "therefore complex networks are a far more appropriate basis for the modelling of most systems with their combination of globality and locality , as well as their freer choice of agent - agent contacts .",
    "one of the main aims of this paper is thus to study the competitive cluster model of @xcite on networks .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we introduce the model ( sec .",
    "[ sec_model ] ) ; next , we do a deeper investigation of the problem in two dimensions in sec .",
    "[ regular ] .",
    "here , we demonstrate the inherent complexity of the problem in finite - dimensional systems , where , contrary to the mean - field case , the largest cluster is not necessarily a survivor .",
    "next , we investigate the main features of the model on a network . starting with a regular network ( which here is a finite - dimensional lattice ) with nearest - neighbour interactions , we add non - local links to the existing lattice , with an associated probability @xmath0 , in the range @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we measure the survivor ratios as a function of the wiring probability @xmath0 , as @xmath0 is increased to reflect the topologies of small world networks and fully random networks ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "our system turns out to exhibit great sensitivity to small changes in the initial distribution of clusters ; we characterize this using the concept of damage spreading ( sec .",
    "[ sec_dam ] ) .    in sec .",
    "[ networksmall ] , we ask the following question : can the destiny of a selected cluster be changed by networking ? by ` networking ' we mean there is a two way interaction between two or more clusters .",
    "we evolve a strategy to do this by selectively networking a cluster of our choice with non - local clusters based on their initial we masses .",
    "one of our most interesting observations in this paper is that a cluster which would die in its original neighbourhood , _ is indeed able to change its fate _ , becoming a survivor via selective networking .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ univ ] we calculate the pair - wise probability for a cluster to survive against larger and smaller neighbours ; the probability distributions obtained show an interesting universality , independent of the mass considered .",
    "we discuss the implications of these and other results in our concluding section , sec .",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "the present model was first used in the context of cosmology to describe the mass accretion of black holes in the presence of a radiation field @xcite .",
    "its applications , however , are considerably more general ; used in the context of economics @xcite , it manifested an interesting rich - get - richer behaviour . here , we recapitulate some of its principal properties @xcite .",
    "consider an array of immobile clusters with time - dependent masses @xmath3 located at equi - spaced regular lattice sites .",
    "the time evolution of masses of the clusters is given by the coupled deterministic first order equations , @xmath4 here , the parameter @xmath5 is called the mass accretion parameter and @xmath6 defines the coupling between the clusters @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; there is no self coupling . the first term in the r. h. s of eqn .",
    "[ blackhole ] represents the gain term , which is composed of two terms - the free rate of growth of an individual cluster ( proportional to the parameter @xmath9 ) , and the rate of growth induced by all other clusters coupled through the surrounding medium .",
    "the coupling @xmath6 between two clusters is proportional to the inverse square distance @xmath10 between them at an initial time @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the negative second term , @xmath12 , represents the dissipation to the surrounding medium .    a logarithmic time is introduced in the study for convenience .",
    "we define a reduced time @xmath13 , where @xmath11 is the initial time .",
    "similarly , for convenience , we define reduced masses @xmath14 . using the new variables , eqn .",
    "[ blackhole ] can be rewritten as , @xmath15 the primes denote the differentiation performed with respect to the reduced time variable @xmath16 throughout .",
    "continuing our recapitulation of the results of the model @xcite , we consider a scenario where there is a single isolated cluster , whose initial reduced square mass is @xmath17 . under the dynamics defined by eqn .",
    "[ model ] , the cluster will be a survivor only if @xmath18 , else it will eventually die out ( see fig .",
    "[ freemasses ] ) @xcite .",
    "next , consider a system of two clusters with equal initial masses ; it has been shown @xcite that there exists a critical coupling @xmath19 such that for @xmath20 they both survive if their initial masses are greater than @xmath21 . in the case of two clusters with unequal masses ,",
    "the smallest of them dies first , in reduced time @xmath22 , and the largest cluster will either survive ( if @xmath23 ) or die ( if @xmath24 ) .    consider the limit of an infinitely large number of clusters all connected to each other ; this represents a limiting mean field regime , with fully collective behaviour involving long - range interactions . for @xmath25 , all the clusters but",
    "the largest will eventually die out . in the weak coupling regime ( @xmath20 ) , which is the focus of this paper , the dynamics consist of two successive stages @xcite . in stage",
    "i , the clusters behave as if they were isolated ; they grow ( or die ) quickly if their masses are greater ( or less ) than the threshold @xmath21 . in stage",
    "ii , slow collective dynamics leads to a scenario where , again , only the single largest cluster survives .",
    "this weakly interacting mean field regime shows the presence of two well - separated time scales , a characteristic feature of glassy systems @xcite .",
    "similar glassy dynamics also arise when the model is solved on a periodic lattice with nearest - neighbour interactions .",
    "the dynamical equations in eqn . [ model ]",
    "take the form @xcite :    @xmath26    by keeping the terms upto first order in @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath28 runs over the @xmath29 nearest neighbours of the site @xmath30 , where for a one - dimensional ring topology @xmath31 , for a two - dimensional lattice @xmath32 , and so on for any space of dimension @xmath33 .",
    "we summarize earlier results on the dynamics : in stage i , clusters evolve independently ; only those whose initial mass @xmath34 survive this stage . in stage",
    "ii , the dynamics are slow and collective ; the survivors of this stage are fully isolated from each other by ` dead ' sites , and their number asymptotes to a constant @xmath35 ( fig .",
    "[ surratio ] ) .",
    "these isolated clusters survive forever .    following the mean field scenario , where the largest cluster is the only one to survive , we ask if this would also be the case for the finite - dimensional case : that is , are the survivors the largest in the locality ?",
    "somewhat surprisingly ,",
    "this is not always the case .",
    "while one can certainly rule out the survival of a cluster whose initial mass is less than threshold ( @xmath21 ) , many - body interactions give rise to extremely complex dynamics in stage ii for clusters with @xmath36 .",
    "the asymptotic configurations of survivors in the finite - dimensional case are thus often nontrivial and counter - intuitive ( see sec . [ regular ] ) .",
    "in this section we do a deeper investigation of the cluster growth model @xcite , with individual clusters placed on the vertices of a regular two - dimensional lattice with nearest - neighbour interactions ( coordination number for all the clusters in the lattice is @xmath37 ) . while the results of sec .",
    "[ sec_dam ] will show the extreme sensitivity of the model to the distribution of cluster masses , the results of this section will help us get a flavour of the complexity displayed by the model .",
    "we choose a @xmath38 regular lattice for our investigations in this paper , unless otherwise specified ; we have checked that there are no observable finite size effects for this choice .",
    "initial masses are characterized by an exponential distribution @xmath39 , where the mean is taken to be @xmath40 , for different values of @xmath41 . the coupling parameter is set at @xmath42 and the parameter @xmath5 set to @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "first we consider two of the more obvious cases for demonstration ( fig .",
    "[ cm_obvious ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ cm_obvious](a ) , the central cluster has the largest mass among its neighbours , and in fig .",
    "[ cm_obvious](b ) , the central cluster has the smallest mass of those of its three neighbours which are larger than threshold ( the fourth one will obviously not survive beyond stage i ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we now use this observation to try to change the fate of a dying cluster , and turn it into a survivor .",
    "although the nonlinear , many - body nature of the problem makes it rather difficult to construct such cases , we have been able to network an erstwhile dying cluster with suitable nonlocal contacts , and returning it to life .",
    "figure [ givelife ] shows our results : the central cluster would eventually have died in its original environment , but on adding @xmath44 small clusters ( whose mass @xmath45 ) it manages to live .",
    "further additions , e.g. @xmath46 or @xmath47 clusters evidently make it a better survivor ( fig .",
    "[ givelife ] ( b ) ) .",
    "here we are dealing with a far more complex problem than the case discussed in earlier subsection .",
    "when we choose clusters with masses larger than @xmath21 , their lifespan will exceed stage i ; thus during stage i they will have a positive growth rate . depending on their individual environments , they may survive through stage ii - thereby having a positive growth - or die as a result of a negative growth rate . networking with such clusters",
    "is therefore a rather delicate matter .",
    "+    first , we consider nonlocal connections with would - be survivors ( @xmath48 ) which are less massive than our chosen cluster ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "such would - be survivors will live beyond stage i and will grow with a positive rate .",
    "this is shown clearly in fig .",
    "[ freemasses ] where clusters with @xmath50 die in finite time and clusters with @xmath48 grow beyond stage i. from a mean field perspective , we would therefore expect to see a decrease in the chances of survival of the chosen cluster as it networks with more and more would - be survivors .",
    "+    figure [ schem636 ] shows a sample scenario , where the central cluster is connected with nonlocal clusters which are not only would - be survivors ( @xmath48 ) , but also less massive than the central cluster . in fig .",
    "[ schem636 ] ( a ) the central cluster networks with 6 would - be survivors and is able to survive in the asymptotic state ( fig .",
    "[ schem636 ] ( b ) ) . on the other hand , adding one more would - be survivor ( fig . [ schem636 ] ( c ) ) to the existing network of the central cluster kills it in the asymptotic state ( fig .",
    "[ schem636 ] ( d ) ) .",
    "we also note that , this change in the fate of the central cluster - from being a survivor to being a dying cluster , due to the additional connection - also changes the fate some of the clusters linked to the central cluster ( contrast figs .",
    "[ schem636 ] ( b ) and ( d ) ) .    to understand the dynamics leading to the observed behaviour we look at the rates of growth of the central cluster and its neighbours .",
    "a sample result corresponding to the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ schem636 ] is discussed in fig . [",
    "636 ] . here",
    ", we see that increasing the number of nonlocal connections with would - be survivors leads to a fall in the absolute value of @xmath51 as well as its rate of growth @xmath52 . beyond a certain number of networked contacts , the central cluster begins to decay , and eventually dies .",
    "this crossover from life to death happens when the cumulative rate of growth of the neighbours @xmath53 is larger than that of the central cluster @xmath52 .",
    "unfortunately the intricate many - body nature of this problem precludes a prediction of when such crossovers might occur in general .",
    "we will have more to say on this issue in the next section .",
    "+    finally , in the case where a given cluster networks with larger would - be survivors ( @xmath48 and @xmath54 ) , one would expect a speedier death .",
    "one such sample scenario is depicted in fig .",
    "[ schem1054 ] and the corresponding rates of evolution of the clusters in fig .",
    "we notice that in its original configuration the central cluster ( with four neighbours , ( @xmath55 ) ) is a survivor .",
    "as we increase the number of networked connections , its growth gets stunted ; there is a substantial fall for 2 extra links ( @xmath56 in fig . [ 1054 ] ) .",
    "adding one more link ( @xmath57 ) does the final damage ; the central cluster dies . the rates shown in fig .",
    "[ 1054 ] ( b ) and ( c ) for @xmath56 connections and @xmath57 connections vividly capture the competition for survival , leading to life in one case and death in the other .",
    "+    as expected , we observe that fewer connections ( here , @xmath57 ) are needed , compared to the earlier case with smaller would - be survivors ( @xmath58 ) , to kill the chosen cluster . in closing",
    ", we should of course emphasise that these results are sample results chosen to illustrate a qualitative point : the choice of different nonlocal sites to network with would certainly modify our @xmath59 values .",
    "the results of the previous section indicate that if a cluster wants to change its fate , it should always network with non - survivors ; however , it seems intuitively reasonable to suppose that it might also be able to do this if it networks with would - be survivors , provided that they are much smaller than itself . finding such cases is possible ex post facto ; their prediction is next to impossible given the complexity of the problem .",
    "an interesting case to consider might be one where , against the odds , the most massive cluster in a given neighbourhood dies marginally , because of the unexpected growth of its erstwhile smaller neighbours .",
    "if , now , it is able to network with potential survivors much smaller than itself ( who , as a result of their own dynamics , would eventually perish in their own neighbourhoods ) , this would be a promising way of selectively networking itself to life .",
    "similar issues are associated with survivors who survive against the odds ; they could be killed off by suitable networking .",
    "a systematic way of exploring this question is to look at the statistics associated with some of these rare events .",
    "we look first at the four immediate neighbours of a given cluster , and consider their pairwise interactions with it . clearly ,",
    "had such a pair been isolated , the larger cluster would have won @xcite . however , many - body interactions in the lattice mean that this is not always true .",
    "we therefore ask the question : _ what is the proportion of _ cases where the larger cluster wins ?",
    "+     +     +    each survivor has four neighbours ; we first calculate the probability distribution of the initial mass differences in a pairwise fashion between a survivor and each of its neighbours .",
    "the initial mass differences are given by @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) corresponding to the four neighbours - right , left , bottom and top - of a survivor .",
    "the distribution of @xmath62 for all the survivors is shown in fig .",
    "[ univ_fig ] . here",
    ", a negative @xmath62 means that the survivor is smaller than its neighbour , and conversely for positive @xmath62 .",
    "all four distributions corresponding to four neighbouring pairs overlap due to isotropy ; the resulting distributions are universal functions of _ mass differences _ , depending only on @xmath63 .",
    "we also obtain the cumulative mass difference between survivors and all of their four neighbours viz .",
    "@xmath64 ( see fig . [ univ_cuml ] ) .",
    "the distributions of @xmath65 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ univ_cuml ] for different values of @xmath63 . for a positive cumulative mass difference",
    "we know that the survivor has a larger initial mass than the sum of its neighbours , matching our intuition based on the mean - field regime .",
    "the negative side of the distribution is more interesting , comprising survivors whose initial masses are smaller than the sum of the initial masses of their immediate neighbours .",
    "notice that both the survivor - neighbour pair distribution ( fig .",
    "[ univ_fig ] ) , and the survivor- all neighbours cumulative distribution ( fig .",
    "[ univ_cuml ] ) get broader with increasing @xmath63 .",
    "this is because increasing @xmath66 @xcite increases the number of potential survivors @xmath41 beyond stage 1 . in each case",
    ", the fraction of area under the negative side of the survivor pair - distribution gives an estimate of survivors against the odds  an example of some of the rare events alluded to at the beginning of this section .",
    "figure [ all_prob ] shows this fraction , both in terms of individual survivor - pair distribution and cumulative distribution , as a function of the @xmath63 of the initial mass distribution , for different system sizes .",
    "there are more survivors , hence more survivors _ against _ the odds , leading to an increase in the fraction plotted on the y - axis of fig .",
    "[ all_prob ] for both distributions . for the largest system size",
    ", there is full isotropy in the pairwise distributions ; the probability of finding a survivor against the odds is now seen to be a _ regular and universal function _ of @xmath63 in both pairwise and cumulative cases , relying only on mass differences rather than on masses . finally , the cumulative distribution gives a more stringent survival criterion than the pairwise one , as is to be expected from the global nature of the dynamics .    a major conclusion to be drawn from fig .",
    "[ all_prob ] is the following : there are clusters which _ die _ against the odds ( clusters which are more massive than the survivor in either a pairwise or cumulative sense ) . recalling again",
    "that the distributions plotted are independent of mass , it should therefore be possible to pick dying clusters whose mass was greater than threshold and to network them with their peers so that they can survive",
    ". this will be the subject of future work .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the cluster growth model of @xcite on a square lattice .",
    "our main emphasis has been on stochastic networking strategies : long - range connections are introduced with probability @xmath67 to existing lattice sites .",
    "we find first of all that the qualitative features of the networked system remain the same as that of the regular case , in that the presence of two well - separated dynamical stages is retained ; the glassy dynamics and metastable states of the earlier work @xcite persist .",
    "however , the number of survivors decreases as expected with increasing @xmath0 , in accordance with a mean field perspective .",
    "also , the system is very sensitive to the smallest changes in the initial mass configuration ; the divergence is , interestingly , exponential irrespective of the magnitudes of the masses swapped . to quantify this ,",
    "we have used the concept of damage spreading .",
    "the central result of this paper is the use of smart networking strategies to modify the fate of an arbitrary cluster .",
    "we find that it is safest to network with non - survivors ; their decay and eventual death lead to the transformation of the destiny of a given site , from death to survival , or from survival to stronger survival .",
    "networking with peers or with those of larger initial mass in general leads to weakening , and an almost inevitable death .",
    "however , the above is not immutable : the probability distributions in the last section of the paper indicate an interesting universality of survival ` against the odds ' . in future work",
    ", we will exploit this result to develop schemes for survival strategies ; in complex systems of this type , it seems clear that the phrase ` survival of the fittest ' is more likely to be replaced by ` survival of the best networked ' .",
