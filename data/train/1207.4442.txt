    "difficult combinatorial landscapes are found in many important problems in physics , computing , and in common everyday life activities such as resource allocation and scheduling .",
    "for example , spin - glass systems give rise to such energy landscapes which are characterized by many local minima and high energy barriers between them .",
    "these landscapes generally show frustration , i.e.  frozen disorder where the system is unable to relax into a state in which all constraints are satisfied . in completely different fields , such as combinatorial optimization ,",
    "similar hard problems also arise , for example the well - known _ traveling salesman problem _ and many others .    in order to understand the reasons that make these problems difficult to optimize ,",
    "a number of model landscapes have been proposed .",
    "one of the simplest yet representative example is kauffman s family of @xmath0 landsdcapes  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 family of landscapes is a problem - independent model for constructing multimodal landscapes that can gradually be tuned from smooth to rugged , where the term `` rugged '' is intuitively related to the degree of variability in the objective function value in neighboring positions in configuration space .",
    "the more rugged the landscape , the higher the number of local optima , and the landscape becomes correspondingly more difficult to search for the global optimum .",
    "the idea of an @xmath0 landscape is to have @xmath2  spins \" or `` genes '' , each with two possible values , @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the model is a real stochastic function @xmath5 defined on binary strings @xmath6 of length @xmath2 , @xmath7 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 determines how many other spin values in the string influence a given spin @xmath8 .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is the average of the contributions @xmath9 of all the spins :    @xmath10    by increasing the value of @xmath1 from 0 to @xmath11 , @xmath0 landscapes can be tuned from smooth to rugged . for @xmath12",
    "all contributions can be optimized independently which makes @xmath5 a simple additive function with a single maximum . at the other extreme when @xmath13 the landscape becomes completely random ,",
    "the probability of any given configuration of being the optimum is @xmath14 , and the expected number of local optima is @xmath15 .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath1 interpolate between these two cases and have a variable degree of `` epistasis '' , i.e. of spin ( or gene ) interaction  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 variables that form the context of the fitness contribution of gene @xmath16 can be chosen according to different models .",
    "the two most widely studied models are the _ random neighborhood _ model , where the @xmath1 variables are chosen randomly according to a uniform distribution among the @xmath11 variables other than @xmath16 , and the _ adjacent neighborhood _ model , in which the @xmath1 variables are those closest to @xmath16 in a total ordering @xmath17 ( using periodic boundaries ) .",
    "no significant differences between the two models were found in terms of global properties of the respective families of landscapes , such as mean number of local optima or autocorrelation length @xcite .",
    "similarly , our preliminary studies on the characteristics of the @xmath0 landscape optima networks did not show noticeable differences between the two neighborhood models .",
    "therefore , we conducted our full study on the more general random model .",
    "the @xmath0 model is related to spin glasses , and more precisely to @xmath18-spin models  @xcite , where @xmath18 plays a role similar to @xmath1 . in spin glasses",
    "the function analogous to @xmath5 is the energy @xmath19 and the stable states are the minima of the energy hypersurface .    in this study we seek to provide fundamental new insights into the structural organization of the local optima in combinatorial landscapes , particularly into the connectivity of their basins of attraction .",
    "combinatorial landscapes can be seen as a graph whose vertices are the possible configurations .",
    "if two configurations can be transformed into each other by a suitable operator move , then we can trace an edge between them . the resulting graph , with",
    "an indication of the fitness at each vertex , is a representation of the given problem fitness landscape .",
    "a useful a simplification of the graphs for the energy landscapes of atomic clusters was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the idea consists in taking as vertices of the graph not all the possible configurations , but only those that correspond to energy minima . for atomic clusters these are well - known , at least for relatively small assemblages .",
    "two minima are considered connected , and thus an edge is traced between them , if the energy barrier separating them is sufficiently low . in this case",
    "there is a transition state , meaning that the system can jump from one minimum to the other by thermal fluctuations going through a saddle point in the energy hyper - surface .",
    "the values of these activation energies are mostly known experimentally or can be determined by simulation . in this way",
    ", a network can be built which is called the `` inherent structure '' or `` inherent network '' in  @xcite .",
    "we propose a network characterization of combinatorial fitness landscapes by adapting the notion of _ inherent networks _ described above .",
    "we use the family of @xmath0 landscapes as an example . in our case",
    "the inherent network is the graph where the vertices are all the local maxima and the edges account for transition probabilities between maxima .",
    "we exhaustively extract such networks on representative small @xmath0 landscape instances , and perform a statistical characterisation of their properties .",
    "our analysis is inspired , in particular , by the work of @xcite on energy landscapes , and in general , by the field of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "a related work can be found in  @xcite , where the case of lattice polymer chains is studied . however , the notion of an edge there is very different , being related to moves that bring a given conformation into an allowed neighboring one .",
    "similar ideas have been put forward in physical chemistry to understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of complex biomolecules through the network study of their free - energy landscapes  @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that our approach is different from the barrier - tree representations of landscapes proposed by stadler et al .",
    "( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the next section describes how combinatorial landscapes are mapped onto networks , and includes the relevant definitions and algorithms used in our study .",
    "the empirical analysis of our selected @xmath0 landscape instances is presented in the following two sections ; one devoted to the study of basins , and the other to the network statistical features .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions and ideas for future work .",
    "many natural and artificial systems can be modeled as networks .",
    "typical examples are communication systems ( the internet , the web , telephonic networks ) , transportation lines ( railway , airline routes ) , biological systems ( gene and protein interactions ) , and social interactions ( scientific co - authorship , friendships ) .",
    "it has been shown in recent years that many of these networks exhibit was has been called a _ small - world _",
    "topology @xcite , in which nodes are highly clustered yet the path length between them is small",
    ". additionally , in several of these networks the distribution of the number of neighbours ( the degree distribution ) is typically right - skewed with a  heavy tail \" , meaning that most of the nodes have less - than - average degree whilst a small fractions of hubs have a large number of connections .",
    "these topological features are very relevant since they impact strongly on networks properties such as their robustness and searchability .    to model a physical energy landscape as a network , doye  @xcite needed to decide first on a definition both of a state of the system and how two states were connected",
    ". the states and their connections will then provide the nodes and edges of the network . for systems with continuous degrees of freedom , this was achieved through the ` inherent structure ' mapping . in this mapping",
    "each point in configuration space is associated with the minimum ( or ` inherent structure ' ) reached by following a steepest - descent path from that point .",
    "this mapping divides configurations into basins of attraction surrounding each minimum on the energy landscape .",
    "our goal is to adapt this idea to the context of combinatorial optimization . in our case",
    ", the vertexes of the graph can be straightforwardly defined as the local maxima of the landscape .",
    "these maxima are obtained exhaustively by running a best - improvement local search algorithm ( see fig . [ algohc ] ) from every configuration of the search space . the definition of the edges , however , is a much more delicate matter . in our initial attempt",
    "@xcite we considered that two maxima @xmath20 and @xmath21 were connected ( with an undirected and unweighed edge ) , if there exists at least one pair of direct neighbors solutions @xmath16 and @xmath22 , one in each basin of attraction ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "we found empirically on small instances of @xmath0 landscapes , that such definition produced densely connected graphs , with very low ( @xmath25 ) average path length between nodes for all @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , apart from the already known increase in the number of optima with increasing @xmath1 , no other network property accounted for the increase in search difficulty .",
    "furthermore , a single pair of neighbours between adjacent basins , may not realistically account for actual basin transitions occurring when using common heuristic search algorithms .",
    "these considerations , motivated us to search for alternative definitions of the edges connecting local optima .",
    "in particular , we decided to associate weights to the edges that account for the transition probabilities between the nodes ( local optima ) .",
    "more details on the relevant algorithms and formal definitions are given below .",

    "the previous results clearly confirm and justify from a novel network point of view the empirically known fact that @xmath0 landscapes become harder to search as they become more and more random with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the construction of the maxima networks requires the determination of the basins of attraction of the corresponding landscapes .",
    "we have thus also described the nature of the basins , and found that the size of the basin corresponding to the global maximum becomes smaller with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "the distribution of the basin sizes is approximately exponential for all @xmath2 and @xmath1 , but the basin sizes are larger for low @xmath1 , another indirect indication of the increasing randomness and difficulty of the landscapes when @xmath1 becomes large .",
    "furthermore , there is a strong positive correlation between the basin size and the degree of the corresponding maximum , which confirms that the synthetic view provided by the maxima graph is a useful .",
    "finally , we found that the size of the basins boundaries is roughly the same as the size of basins themselves .",
    "therefore , nearly all the configurations in a given basin have a neighbor solution in another basin .",
    "this observation suggests a different landscape picture than the smooth standard representation of 2d landscapes where the basins of attraction are visualized as real mountains .",
    "some of these results on basins in @xmath0 landscapes were previously unknown  @xcite .",
    "this study represents our first attempt towards a topological and statistical characterization of easy and hard combinatorial landscapes , from the point of view of complex networks analysis .",
    "much remains to be done .",
    "first of all , the results found should be confirmed for larger instances of @xmath0 landscapes .",
    "this will require good sampling techniques , or theoretical studies since exhaustive sampling becomes quickly impractical .",
    "other landscape types should also be examined , such as those containing neutrality , which are very common in real - world applications , and especially the landscapes generated by important hard combinatorial problems such as the traveling salesman problem and other resource allocation problems .",
    "work is in progress for neutral versions of @xmath0 landscapes and for knapsack problems .",
    "finally , the landscape statistical characterization is only a step towards implementing good methods for searching it .",
    "we thus hope that our results will help in designing or estimating efficient search techniques and operators .",
