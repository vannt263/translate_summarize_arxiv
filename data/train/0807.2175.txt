    "since the start of the tevatron run ii running at 1.96 tev in 2001 , the cdf experiment has accumulated extremely large samples of charm - containing events .",
    "these have been taken with several triggers , and especially the so - called `` two track trigger '' which selects tracks displaced from the main vertex at an early stage of the trigger process .",
    "other useful triggers have been based on muon identification . in this",
    "talk i present three recent analyses which illustrate different facets of the cdf charm program .",
    "r0.5        in run i , cdf published inclusive cross sections for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 production  @xcite , and an earlier cdf ii paper  @xcite presented inclusive cross sections for @xmath1 production .",
    "these results have now been complemented with a new measurement of the inclusive @xmath2 cross section using 1.1 fb@xmath3 of run ii data .",
    "the central drift chamber and muon detection system were used to detect the dimuon decay of the @xmath2 , selecting on dimuon masses in the range 3.5 - 3.8 gev / c@xmath4 , with the @xmath2 rapidity in the range @xmath5 , and transverse momentum in the range 2.0 - 30.0 gev / c , giving a clear improvement on the run 1 lower limit of 5.0 gev / c .",
    "the signal was extracted from the background by means of an unbinned maximum likelihood fit using parametrized functions for the background and the signal .",
    "the signal and background both have a prompt @xmath2 component and one arising from @xmath6 decays , which are distinguished by means of the distance of the dimuon vertex from the beamline as measured using the silicon vertex detector .",
    "the prompt component was modelled as a gaussian in terms of the distance of the vertex from the beamline , and the decayed component by convoluting this with an exponential decay distribution .",
    "+     production at cdf , as in fig .  1 , compared to the @xmath1 cross section . ]",
    "the results are shown in figs .  1 - 3 .",
    "the total integrated @xmath2 cross section is @xmath7(stat)@xmath8(sys ) nb .",
    "there is good agreement with the run i results . in comparison with the @xmath1",
    "cross section , that of the @xmath2 is lower by one to two orders of magnitude .",
    "production at cdf , showing the prompt ( upper ) and @xmath6-decay ( lower ) components separately , compared to the run i results .",

    "title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "there have recently been significant developments in extending the studies of mixing into the charm sector .",
    "belle have obtained evidence that the lifetime for @xmath9 decay into cp eigenstates , such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 is different from cp - mixed states , such as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "babar , meanwhile , have found a difference in the decay time between the decays @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "cdf have now found evidence for the latter of these two effects , for the first time in @xmath15 mesons produced by hadronic collisions . @xcite .",
    "the approach followed is first to define the quantity @xmath16 as the ratio of the observed numbers of @xmath12 and @xmath17 decays undergone by @xmath9 under experimental conditions .",
    "the similarity of the kinematic acceptances means that the systematic uncertainty on this measured ratio is small .",
    "then , with reasonable assumptions , it can be shown that @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the `` direct '' ratio , @xmath20 is the decay time and @xmath21 are linear combinations of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , namely the scaled mass and width differences between the two physical eigenstates .",
    "+     +    using 1.5 fb@xmath3 of data , the initial @xmath9 or @xmath24 mesons are identified in @xmath25 decays , using the sign of the soft pion to tag the @xmath15 state .",
    "the ratio @xmath16 of the``wrong sign / right sign '' decays ( cabibbo doubly suppressed / allowed , in the absence of oscillations ) is then plotted as a function of decay time .",
    "the result , when fitted with a quadratic curve , is suggestive that @xmath16 rises with @xmath20 ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "bayesian probability contours were now constructed in the @xmath26 space using a flat prior .",
    "a value of @xmath26 significantly different from the no - mixing point at the origin indicates @xmath9-@xmath24 mixing .",
    "the no - mixing point is found to lie on a contour corresponding to a probability level of @xmath27 or 3.8 @xmath28 .",
    "this is claimed as evidence for mixing .",
    "the decay @xmath29 is strongly suppressed in the standard model .",
    "figure 5 shows two short - range sm decays ( top ) a long - range sm decay ( middle ) and a possible susy decay ( bottom ) .",
    "the predicted sm rates are very low and correspond to a branching ratio of approximately @xmath30 , far below foreseeable experimental measurements .",
    "however the susy decays can give branching ratios of up to @xmath31 , well within present experimental capabilities .",
    "earlier in run ii , cdf published a branching ratio limit of @xmath32 ( 90% cl ) @xcite , which has since been reduced to @xmath33 by babar @xcite . here using a larger data sample , we present a new result which improves substantially on the previous values .      in order to reduce backgrounds , which arise principally from muon pairs from @xmath6 meson decays",
    ", both decay muons are required to have good identification within the cdf central muon detector system ( cmu , cmx ) .",
    "an illustration of the mass peak obtainable in cdf is given in fig .",
    "6 , which shows @xmath11 decays of @xmath9 meson in which the pions have been relabelled as muons and point into the central muon detectors .",
    "the muons arising from @xmath6 decays are removed by cuts on the vertex position and pointing of the muon pair as measured in the silicon vertex detector .",
    "a total of 4 candidate events were observed , with an expectation of 8.6 ; using a bayesian approach this gives an upper limit on the branching ratio of @xmath35 ( 90% cl ) or @xmath36 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "using just 360 pb@xmath3 of data , this is currently the world s best result for this channel , and translates into significant constraints on the r - parity violating couplings within susy .",
