    "extensive work has been published on various nano - structure devices that use two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg )  @xcite .",
    "numerous devices have been built using nanofabrication that involve shaping the 2deg by applying gate voltages .",
    "some of the techniques use in - plane gating  @xcite ; however , most of them use off - plane gating  @xcite . here , we study an off - plane device whose gate is also a 2deg .",
    "our work was prompted by a paper by h. l. stormer et al .",
    "@xcite in that paper , a new type of t - shaped field - effect transistor  ( t - fet ) was presented with an ultra short gate length .",
    "the transistor is made out of a pair of 2degs that are oriented perpendicular to each other .",
    "one is used as the source - drain channel , and the other is used as the gate .",
    "when the gate voltage exceeds a certain critical value , a depletion region is created in the source - drain channel which cuts off the current flow through it .",
    "the device is made exclusively using molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) .",
    "the 2deg of the gate is made by standard modulation doping of a @xmath0 substrate in the following way : +    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      + this produces a modulation - doped quantum well which is @xmath1    wide for the gate and @xmath2    wide for the source - drain channel .",
    "a cross section of the transistor is shown in fig .",
    "[ cross ] .    in sec .",
    "[ theory ] , we develop a very simple model for the transistor , based on work done by x. liu and one of us  @xcite . in this model , we assume that the electron distribution is related to the potential energy by the thomas - fermi equation [ thomas ] n = ( -u ) . here , @xmath3 is the extra electron distribution due to the applied gate voltage , @xmath4 is the two - dimensional density of states , and @xmath5 is the change in chemical potential of the two 2degs due to the bias .",
    "the equation is valid everywhere except inside the insulating barriers and any created depletion regions",
    ". it does not give an exact solution to the problem , but it can give a good understanding of the general behavior of this kind of semiconductor device .",
    "furthermore , we initially assume that the two 2degs have no width in the direction in which they are confined by the quantum wells , and that the donors that created the gases are in the same position as the 2degs .",
    "we also assume that no depletion region is created .",
    "these assumptions allow us to come up with an analytic solution to the problem using fourier transforms .    in sec .",
    "[ depletion ] , we allow for a depletion region to be created .",
    "the solution using fourier transforms is no longer feasible , and a numerical solution is used throughout .",
    "special techniques had to be developed for this .    in sec .",
    "[ width ] , we make a more realistic model of the transistor by taking into account the finite width of the gases . the techniques used to solve these are very similar to those used in sec .  [ depletion ] .    in sec",
    "[ analytic ] , an approximate analytic approach is used for the problem inspired by ref .  .",
    "the results of the two methods are then compared in the conclusion .",
    "as a first approach , we assume that the two 2degs have no width and that no depletion region is created . furthermore , we assume that the donors are in the same position as the 2degs . as shown in fig .",
    "[ xy ] , we choose the @xmath6 axis for the gate and the @xmath7 axis for the source - drain channel .",
    "the above assumptions simplify the equations for the potential energy of the gases to @xmath8 which on each axis gives    [ uxy ] @xmath9 and @xmath10    in addition , for each of the 2degs the thomas - fermi equations give    n(x ) = [ _ x - u(x ) ] , and n(y ) = [ _ y - u(y ) ]    for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 axis respectively . substituting in for the potential energy terms on each axis from eqs .",

    "in addition to the above equations , the two additional requirements are the neutrality [ neutr ] _",
    "a^dx n_x(x ) + _",
    "-^dy n_y(y ) = 0 , and the fact that [ dxy ] _ x - _ y = 1 .",
    "the above equation states the fact that the difference in the chemical potentials of the two sides is just the gate voltage .",

    "we give two reasons to explain this discrepancy .",

    "electrons can still tunnel through if the depletion width is on the order of the fermi wavelength .",
    "another , less important reason , is the behavior of the 2deg density close to the boundary .",
    "the wave function for the 2deg can be represented by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are chosen boundaries for the gas . under this assumption , we can calculate the density of the gas to be @xmath40 the effect of this form of charge distribution is to give an effective gate length , which is slightly larger than the geometrical one . to get an estimate for the difference",
    ", we calculate the mean of the extra charge distribution which turns out to be @xmath41 this is an addition of about @xmath42    or @xmath43 to the geometrical gate length .",
