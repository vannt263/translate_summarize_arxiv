    "edwards hypothesized that every mechanically stable micro state of a powder is equally probable in a gibbs - like ensemble , for cases where the powder is prepared in certain , repeatable ways @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis has been extended by others to the statistics of granular contact forces for both isostatic and hyperstatic cases .",
    "packings of round , rigid , frictionless disks or spheres are known to be isostatic @xcite , meaning that there are exactly the same number of contact force unknowns in a granular packing as there are stability equations for the grains , so that the value of each contact force can be resolved by linear algebra operating solely upon the geometry of the inter - granular contact network ( assuming that the overall stress of the packing has also been specified ) . for isostatic cases ,",
    "then , each valid micro state in an edwards ensemble corresponds to exactly one micro state of contact forces .",
    "an ensemble of packings with a flat measure thus implies an ensemble of contact force networks with the same flat measure .",
    "hyperstatic packings , on the other hand , have more contact forces unknowns in the granular packing than there are stability equations for the individual grains .",
    "thus , the values of the forces throughout the packing are mechanically indeterminate .",
    "a gibbs - like ensemble method has been applied to the contact forces in such packings by selecting a single packing geometry that is held constant throughout the ensemble , assuming a flat measure over all of the valid contact force microstates @xcite .",
    "all these ensembles , isostatic as well as hyperstatic , are similar to gibbs ensembles in thermal systems because the flat measure is assumed _ a priori_. the isostatic case was recently analyzed by extending gibbs _ most probable distribution _",
    "method @xcite , the same method used in textbooks to derive the maxwell - boltzmann , bose and fermi distributions . in those derivations ,",
    "the most probable distribution is concerned with momenta @xmath2 or particle energies @xmath3 , but when extended to granular contact forces it predicts the most probable distribution of single grain states , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a set of variables that describe everything that can be known about an individual grain including all of its contact angles , forces and their correlations .",
    "subsequent discrete element modeling has validated the predictions of this theory for the special , isostatic case described above @xcite .",
    "thus , edwards hypothesis is _ sufficient _ to derive granular contact force statistics for single grain states in this case .",
    "however , this paper will show that edwards hypothesis is not really _ necessary _ and that it is not really a part of the reductionist explanation for granular contact force statistics .",
    "it makes a very strong claim about microstructural geometries being equally probable , and this is a much stronger claim than we need to derive granular contact force statistics . instead",
    ", the reductionist explanation is found in the nature of correlations in granular contact forces , which can be summarized in a statement that is a generalization of boltzmann s assumption of molecular chaos .",
    "boltzmann showed that the absence of pre - correlation between colliding gas molecules inexorably relaxes the gas to maximum entropy ; this paper will show that the corresponding condition in granular contact forces inexorably requires the packing to exist ( in its bulk ) in a relaxed state of maximum contact force entropy .",
    "this paper will follow boltzmann s approach , developing a `` translation '' equation analogous to boltzmann s transport equation ( but adapted for static packings in which nothing is moving ) , with a maximum entropy proof similar to the @xmath1 theorem , to produce a new derivation of @xmath4 without making any _ a priori _ assumptions of a flat measure .",
    "this new theory is presented as an alternative to edwards hypothesis to provide a more physical basis for the statistical mechanics of some granular phenomena .",
    "boltzmann wrote a transport equation to track the evolution through time in the single particle distribution function @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is momentum . for _ static _ granular packings we must describe how the statistics evolve through space , not time .",
    "we will therefore perform `` translation '' through successive cross - sectional `` layers '' of grains , as defined here . referring to fig .",
    "( [ conserve ] ) ,     illustration how sheets of force are conserved while translating through a 2d granular packing ( as described in the text ) , so that a boltzmann - like transport equation may be defined . ]",
    "we : ( 1 ) draw a cross - sectional line ( like any one of the straight lines in the figure ) , ( 2 ) select the set of grains intersected by that one line ( shaded grains ) , and ( 3 ) include only those contacts on that set of grains ( heavy dots ) that ( a ) connect to other grains _ external _ to the shaded set and ( b ) are located _ on one side _ of the shaded set .",
    "next , we consider the force vectors on that set of contacts , including both the normal and tangential components of force if the grains are frictional .",
    "we decompose these vectors into cartesian components parallel and normal to the dashed line . summing all the components in the normal direction",
    "produces the `` total cartesian load '' in that plane .",
    "`` translating '' refers to the continuous motion of the cross - sectional line that picks out the set of grains in a layer .",
    "as the line translates across the packing , some grains are no longer intersected by the line and hence leave the layer , while some other grains become intersected by the line and hence join the layer . in the absence of gravity , the total cartesian load is conserved with respect to translating the straight line , as illustrated in the figure by the parallel layer of shaded grains and heavy dots . if that were not so , then the grains between the two shaded layers would be accelerating .",
    "because the container walls might also contribute forces parallel to the direction of translation , thus spoiling the conservation of the total force , we must consider special cases where this can not occur .",
    "there are at least two such cases , corresponding to microcanonical and canonical statistics .",
    "if the container is 2d ( for specificity ) , and if the side walls are flat , parallel and frictionless , then we will have two spatial axes along which to translate layers of grains subject to the conservation laws as shown in the left and right sides of fig .",
    "[ conserve ] .",
    "we can not perform the translation in a diagonal direction in this finite container because then the length of layers will not be constant and neither will the total perpendicular force contained within them .",
    "this translation in a finite container corresponds to microcanonical statistics because the system is closed and the force conservation is exact .",
    "alternatively , we can perform the translation in an extremely large packing ( perhaps infinite ) and consider only the set of grains selected by a relatively short line _ segment _ translating through the middle of the packing far from any boundaries . in that case , the conservation law will not be exact because some force will be entering and exiting the segment at both of its ends throughout the translation . however , the longer the segment of grains is , then the less significant those fluctuations become and the more closely it approximates an exact conservation law .",
    "this corresponds to canonical statistics because the force contained in the finite line segment is in contact with an infinite reservoir of force at each of its ends . in this canonical case",
    "the line segment may have any arbitrary orientation , not only the @xmath8 or @xmath9 directions , and it translates across the packing in a direction normal to its orientation . in this paper",
    "it does not matter whether we consider the microcanonical or canonical case , nor in what direction we imagine the translation to occur .",
    "the generality of the equations describing this translation contributes to the generality of the conclusions .    it should be noted that this translation _ ansatz _ allows us to treat a static granular packing with methods borrowed from kinetic theory , even though the packing is completely static .",
    "the role of the time dimension from kinetic theory is replaced by the translation through a spatial dimension .",
    "the collisions of particles from kinetic theory are replaced by the meeting together of contact forces on the grains .",
    "the force vectors on one hemisphere of a grain are analogous to gas particles going into a collision , and the forces on the opposite hemisphere are analogous to the same particles exiting from the collision later in time .",
    "( the number of contact forces `` entering '' and `` exiting '' the opposite hemispheres of a grain in this fashion need not be conserved . ) thus , the granular theory developed here is analagous to molecular kinetic theory , but it must be remembered that everything is completely static and that all contacts between grains are unchanging in time , not transitory like the collisions in kinetic theory .",
    "this theory is not to be confused with the kinetic theory of granular gases , which deals with grains moving and colliding in time .",
    "although this force conservation applies to more general cases , the remainder of this paper deals only with round , rigid , frictionless , 2d grains .",
    "table  [ convention ] defines the compact notation that will be used to describe the states of ( 1 ) single grains , ( 2 ) sets of grains , and ( 3 ) entire packings in this special case .",

    "boltzmann s _ stosszahlansatz _ , or his assumption of molecular chaos , is that colliding particles have uncorrelated momenta prior to the collision , @xmath20 or more compactly , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the joint probability distribution for the two particles and @xmath23 are the single particle distribution functions .",

    "putting a little space between the four arrow heads and drawing a circle , we see that this set of four vectors is identical to four contact forces on a static grain .",

    "we will show how two different forms of the _ stosszahlansatz _ are obtained depending only upon the directionality of the information flow through the network .",
    "we will obtain boltzmann s _ stosszahlansatz _ when we assume all information travels in one direction across the network ( representing time - asymmetry ) , and we will obtain the granular version of the _ stosszahlansatz _ when we assume information has propagated across the network symmetrically in all directions .",

    "the delta function ensures that the density of states is nonzero only for packings that have the fabric distribution @xmath36 specified within its argument .",
    "this fabric is the joint contact angle distribution @xmath37 providing the probability that all four contacts on an individual grain will take on specified values simultaneously , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "this joint distribution is important because of the intra - grain correlations between contact forces .",
    "the function @xmath38 computes this statistical distribution from the set of grains @xmath39 specified by the locus @xmath17 . in the thermodynamic limit with an infinite number of grains , the delta function selects only those packings that have precisely the specified @xmath36 .",
    "for a practical packing with only a finite number of grains , this term should be defined to allow some statistical fluctuation in @xmath36 . however , as stated above , we do not need to define this term so precisely since it is just a notional placeholder and does not affect the rest of the paper .    the fourth term may be the most confusing , and it factors out of the equations and does not affect the results of this paper , and yet it is the most important term for understanding the purpose of the ensemble .",
    "why do we begin a paper on a boltzmann - type transport equation with an ensemble , which is reminiscent of gibbsian methods ?",
    "we do so because we will apply the generalized _ stosszahlansatz _ to this ensemble and then analyze its statistics to obtain a mathematical form for that _ stosszahlansatz_. that mathematical form can then be used in the boltzmann - type transport equation and we can abandon the ensemble methods at that time .",
    "but for now , this fourth term defines a set of packings in which the density of single particle states can evolve with respect to translation in one of the spatial dimensions , just as boltzmann was concerned with dilute gases in which the distribution of momenta would evolve with respect to translation through the time dimension .",
    "therefore , we subdivide the packing into regions that are subscripted by @xmath40 so that we can translate through these regions by incrementing @xmath40 . these regions are defined between successive cross - sectional planes cutting across the packing as shown in fig .",

    "this term is notional and will factor out from the equations below .",
    "finally , we note that there is no term to specify the stress state of the packing .",
    "that is because it is specified implicitly in the @xmath45 .",
    "we can compute the stress in any region as a function of the contact force vectors in that region .",
    "newton s third law enforced across the packing will ensure that any stresses appearing in adjacent regions are physically possible .",
    "because the identities of the grains are unimportant , the statistics of the ensemble are unaffected by summing the density of states @xmath46 over any set of permutations of grain exchanges . at any particular location in @xmath17-space , the delta function that enforces newton s third law will select from those permutations only those that produce a self - consistent packing . here for convenience we sum over those permutations that keep the grains within their own regions @xmath40 , denoted by the subset @xmath47 of the set @xmath48 of all possible construction lists @xmath49 . @xmath50 all terms in eq .",

    "[ microdos ] , as explained by fig .",
    "[ noforceloops ] .",

    "this converts the ensemble of closed - loop contact force networks into an ensemble of tree networks as shown in fig .",

    "if the generalized _ stosszahlansatz _ is correct , then eliminating @xmath35 will have no effect on the statistics of the contact forces or the single grain states in the ensemble .",
    "we may note that it was a strategic choice to specify the joint distribution of contact angles @xmath36 as the fabric in the fifth term , because it implicitly enforces steric exclusion by evaluating to zero everywhere that adjacent grain contact angles are too close together .",
    "therefore , while @xmath35 served the purpose of enforcing the non - overlapping of grains in the packing , @xmath36 continues to serve this purpose within the first coordination shell of every grain , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the reason this theory is limited to the bulk of the packing , rather than predicting relaxation of stresses moving away from the boundary of a container , is that there are two things that can cause @xmath1 to change : evolving stresses , and evolving fabric . at the present",

    "as with boltzmann s theory , the translation equation and the granular @xmath1 theorem depend upon the validity of the _ stosszahlansatz_. it can be tested only by comparison with experimental or simulation data .",
    "first we must obtain predictions from the theory so we have something to compare .",
    "the numerical solution of @xmath4 from the recursion equation has been obtained ( in approximation , for the isotropic case ) and the details of the method are provided in @xcite .",
    "the method uses monte carol integration , randomly sampling the region of integration with a flat measure .",
    "this is performed in a recursion , with @xmath4 obtained from @xmath118 and vice - versa until convergence .",
    "this recursion begins from an arbitrary initial condition , for example @xmath128 .",
    "several different initial conditions were checked and all converged to the same result .",
    "this method was used to produce a representation of @xmath4 consisting of 12 billion grain configurations , which was sufficient for very smooth statistics . on an average desktop workstation the algorithm converged for a sample of one million grains in about one minute , with a larger number of grains taking proportionately longer .",
    "several different algorithms and different approximations to the math were used and they resulted in only minor variations in the statistical results , demonstrating the robustness of the basic form of the solution .",
    "since a packing s fabric @xmath129 will evolve as the packing is sheared , it is desirable to force the numerical solution to a @xmath4 that has some particular fabric that is found in a real case .",
    "thus , it is necessary to weight the monte carlo sampling to include some classes of contact angle configurations more often than others .",
    "the weighting may be determined iteratively by adjusting the weight factor used in the algorithm until the desired fabric is obtained .",
    "this weight factor , multiplied by zero in the regions of steric exclusion , is in fact the fabric partition factor @xmath126 that appears in eq .",
    "[ conneqn ] .",
    "similarly , the overall stress in the solution @xmath4 may be driven to any desired state by weighting the monte carlo sampling with the boltzman factor shown in eq .",
    "[ conneqn ] .",
    "this numerical solution has been compared to numerical data from discrete element modeling with idealizations approaching those of the theory , and a subset of the results have appeared in a letter @xcite with an archival - length paper to follow .",
    "the simulation used 17,000 grains that were 2d , round , frictionless , and cohesionless .",
    "the fabric used in the theory implies that they are monodisperse ( in that the steric exclusion angle was assumed to be precisely @xmath130 radians ) .",
    "however , the simulation used a small polydispersity of 1.5 to avoid crystallization of the grains . to approach the isotropic idealization",
    "the grains were deposited into a rectangular , rigid - walled container randomly and without gravity , and then expanded in diameter while allowed to push each other around until they jammed .",
    "the grains within four grain diameters of the walls were discarded from the statistical analysis to avoid boundary effects , since the theory describes the bulk of infinitely large packings ( where boundaries do not exist ) .",
    "residual kinetic energy was viscously dissipated until the forces had negligible dynamical fluctuation , representing the idealization of a perfectly static packing .",
    "the grains had a linear spring contact law , but the packing was kept as close as could be achieved near the limit of jamming so that minimal compression of the contacts occurred .",
    "this approximates the perfect grain rigidity and the isostaticity of the theory wherein the exact form of the contact law becomes irrelevant .",
    "the data show that with these idealizations the predictions of the theory are validated .",
    "an example of the correspondence between theory and empirical results is shown in fig .",
    "[ z4compare ] ,    semi logarithmic @xmath131 obtained in numerical solution of the translation equation ( theory ) and from the @xmath0 population of a dem simulation .",

    "discussion of the results of @xmath132 grains is found in @xcite and will be expanded in the future archival - length paper .",
    "it should be noted that there are no free parameters in the theory that could have been adjusted to obtain the correspondence ; the good agreement occurs automatically .",
    "thus , the _ stosszahlansatz _ has been validated along with the maximum entropy condition that it predicts for this isotropic case .",
    "we may conclude that the reductionist explanation for granular contact force statistics is that they exist at maximum entropy , and that is because correlations can not arise through the closure of loops of grains .",
    "this statement should be further tested in non - isotropic and less idealized cases .",
    "by following boltzmann s method but with symmetric information flow in the collision network , this paper has shown that the layer - by - layer relationships in granular contact forces , like the time - evolution of momenta in a dilute gas , must cause their statistical distribution to relax to the form that represents maximum entropy .",
    "this paper also derived a version of boltzmann s _ stosszahlansatz _ and a version of shannon s entropy ( negative @xmath1 ) relevant to granular contact forces , and found a way to derive @xmath4 without recourse to edwards hypothesis .",
    "it has been demonstrated previously with more results to appear in a future archival paper that the predictions of @xmath4 are in outstanding agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "boltzmann s @xmath1 theorem for the dilute gas tells us that every tiny segment of the poincre cycle is dominated by the maxwellian distribution , so that only a tiny amount of dynamics is needed to depart from any non - maxwellian state and settle into maximum entropy .",
    "both the poincre ergodicity and the boltzmannian relaxation are thus attained by traveling along the trajectory in phase space .",
    "static granular packings , on the other hand , do not travel along any trajectory in phase space .",
    "the granular translation theorem developed above depends upon contact forces maintaining _",
    "static _ spatial relationships , not traveling and interacting through time . whereas boltzmann s proof obviated the need to travel the _ entire _ poincre cycle and showed that the system need travel only a tiny segment of it to justify the assumptions of statistical mechanics , the granular @xmath1 theorem shows that a granular packing need not travel through @xmath17 space _ at all _ , because it has special relationships between its own layer - wise subspaces built into its single locus in @xmath17 space .",
    "the author proposes that this special feature of granular packings deserves a name , and `` self - ergodic '' seems appropriate .",
    "that is , the system must exist in a relaxed state by nature of its internal relationships ( self - enforced and affecting itself ) , and this produces the same statistical characteristics that an ergodic theorem seeks to establish for kinetic systems exploring all conserved - energy states with equal probability .",
    "thus the terminology : self + ergodic .",
    "there are of course many significant classes of granular packings that will not be relaxed to maximum entropy , but these have not been discussed here .",
    "these include the boundary regions near the container walls of a packing , as well as granular packings that were prepared to have abrupt changes in fabric somewhere within their bulk so that the density of states can not be in its most relaxed state within the narrow band of grains on both sides of the interface .",
    "the difficulty in applying this theory to boundary regions is that the fabric does not remain constant near the boundary , whereas the theory assumes that the fabric is constant .",
    "another case not described by the theory is the thin layer of grains at the top surface of a packing in gravity , where the self - weight introduces non - negligible stress gradients .",
    "however , solution of the more symmetric case considered here opens the door to solving more complex problems .",
    "this theory has been developed only for the case of rigid , round grains without friction .",
    "this avoids the complication of rotational degrees of freedom for the grains .",
    "the author does not know how to define the grain states to include torques and rotational degrees of freedom so that they would have sufficient symmetry for the analysis .",
    "the assumptions of the theory also exclude cases with highly compressed grains , which are far from isostaticity @xcite .",
    "the theory has been developed assuming @xmath0 for every grain , although frictionless 2d packings with low polydispersity are known to have grains with @xmath133 , @xmath134 and occasionally @xmath135 .",
    "it seems possible to generalize the theory to allow for different values of @xmath136 as long as the average is still 4 for isostaticity . in this paper ,",
    "the grain state @xmath5 was defined to have just the two variables with units of force , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , plus the four contact angles .",
    "we may alternatively use the two variables @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "so , for grains with @xmath139 we would define @xmath140 , and this would be sufficient to define the grain s entire state allowing us to solve all the contact force values on the grain by linear algebra and trigonometry . for @xmath0 we would use @xmath141 , which is equivalent to the treatment given in this paper .",
    "then , for @xmath134 we need one additional state variable in @xmath142 to allow us to solve all five contact forces on the grain",
    ". this additional variable could simply be the value of one of the contact forces , but to maintain symmetry among the contacts it would presumably be better to define something analogous to a quadrupole term and thus continue the sequence of @xmath143 and @xmath144 , which represent the monopole and dipole terms , respectively .",
    "obtaining a numerical solution to the resulting theory would be a simple extension of the existing @xmath0 algorithm .",
    "it is unknown whether this theory will work for an ordered ( crystalline ) granular packing .",
    "experimental and numerical studies have shown that even the microscopic variations in packing geometry of crystalline packings are sufficient to break the symmetry and relax @xmath118 to a typical form @xcite .",
    "this theory may take advantage of this by keeping translation distances @xmath61 small enough that the microscopic packing variations are orders - of - magnitude larger .",
    "thus even with a crystalline packing the assumptions behind eqs .  [ leaving ] and  [ entering ] should be valid and the theory may work .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that correlations will arise in the regular pattern of closed loops , violating the generalized _ stosszahlansatz_. it would be interesting to study how much disorder is required for the theory to work .    one application of this theory in particular was hypothesized by the author several years ago @xcite .",
    "the idea is that , since granular contact forces are in a state of equilibrium at maximum entropy subject to the layer - by - layer conservation of forces in each direction , then it is possible to define a rank-2 tensor `` temperature '' for the contact forces and even a coordination number `` chemical potential '' to explain the partition of stress and fabric fluctuations throughout a granular packing .",
    "this approach may lead to a full theory of rheology .",
    "these observations were apparent when numerical solutions to the theory first proved robust and convergent , even before this formal proof of maximum entropy was accomplished .",
    "that is because the numerical convergence discussed in the earlier publications was in fact an empirical demonstration of the same concept .",
    "once the `` self - ergodic '' nature of granular materials is identified , then the temperature and entropy concepts fall out rather straightforwardly . a future publication will be forthcoming to explain these concepts along with a series of discrete element modeling simulations that have been performed to test them and to draw further conclusions .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ loopcorr ] ,     correlations between neighboring contact forces may arise two different ways .",
    "( left ) they arise through intra - grain stability requirements , resulting in a strong , two - point correlation between the forces at @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "( right ) they arise through a series of intra - grain stability requirements working grain - by - grain around the loops , resulting in weak higher - order correlations .",
    "the example here shows a four - point correlation through the loop , @xmath145 to @xmath122 to @xmath147 to @xmath146 , which will be much weaker than the direct two - point correlation from @xmath145 to @xmath146 . ]",
    "correlations between neighboring contacts on the same grain arise either through the grain itself or through the loops in the packing .",
    "a typical loop is four or more grains , so going the long way around a loop induces a relatively weak four - point correlation , but going the short way between the two contacts ( staying intra - grain ) induces a much stronger two - point correlation .",
    "furthermore , we may note that small loops composed of @xmath148 grains , @xmath149 , are formed through adjacent pairs of contacts that are closer to the non - correlating @xmath24 angle than the correlating @xmath150 radians of separation ( see @xcite ) , and hence there should be minimal correlation in each two - point leg of a force loop .",
    "the composite correlation going all the way around the loop must therefore be exceedingly weak .",
    "on the other hand , force loops that pass through a larger number of grains and hence closer to @xmath150 radians of separation for each two - point leg of the loop will require a vastly larger @xmath148 to slowly turn through the full @xmath151 radians to close the loop as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ longloop ] .",
    "contacts that are highly correlated are close to @xmath150 radians apart on the same grain @xcite .",
    "hence , a closed loop composed of highly correlated pairs of contacts can turn only very slowly and must pass through a very large number of grains.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    because @xmath148 is so large ( @xmath152 ) , we would therefore expect these @xmath148-point correlations to be very weak , as well .",
    "the total correlation between a pair of contacts on a grain must be the sum of information from _ all _ the loops in the packing that contain the grain in question . due to the disorder of the packing and the large number of loops that contain the same grain , some correlating and some anti - correlating",
    ", it is expected that the contributions from increasingly larger loops of grains will be increasingly decoherent and largely cancel one another .    from these arguments there is good reason to assume _ a priori _ that the intra - grain contribution to the correlations is the dominant one and that closed - loop contributions may be discarded .",
    "this will be the granular _",
    "stosszahlansatz_. the ultimate proof of this _ stosszahlansatz _ is its ability to make valid predictions .",
    "comparison with empirical data @xcite have validated its predictions .",
    "the purpose of the `` collision auxiliary '' term in eq .",
    "[ nominaldos ] is to restrict the allowable set of vectors `` colliding '' ( meeting together ) at the nodes ( grains or particle collisions ) .",
    "already the vector sums of the forces or momenta are automatically conserved (  la newton s second law ) by the proper selection of phase space coordinates . however , in both granular mechanics and in the kinetic theory of dilute gases there are additional restrictions imposed by physics upon these sets of vectors .    for the case of the dilute gas , in addition to conservation of momentum",
    "there is the requirement for the conservation of energy , and even that is not sufficient to define the allowable sets of vectors appearing at each collision .",
    "a pair of colliding momentum vectors may meet at any arbitrary magnitudes and angle relative to one another .",
    "the magnitudes and directions of the two outgoing momentum vectors are then determined by the precise form of the interaction potential between the particles .",
    "thus , the collision auxiliary term in eq .  [ nominaldos ] must be written to specify the set of allowable outgoing vectors based upon the incoming vectors and the interaction potential .",
    "for the case of granular packings , on the other hand , the sets of allowable force vectors appearing on each grain are not so precisely constrained .",
    "in addition to the conservation of force from one hemisphere to the next ( newton s second law ) there is only the requirements of steric exclusion .",
    "there is no analog of interaction potential or conservation of energy to determine two of the vectors as a function of the other two . precisely because of this additional freedom , granular packings exhibit memory in their fabric , the statistical preponderance of their contact angles resulting from past disturbances of the packing",
    "therefore , an ensemble of granular packings would need to have the current state of its fabric specified in order to be a completely defined ensemble .",
    "the `` collision auxiliary '' is therefore used for this purpose .",
    "although the collision auxiliary plays two very different roles in granular versus kinetic ensembles , they have been lumped together here under the name `` collision auxiliary '' because they both play the role of defining the sets of vectors appearing at the nodes insofar as required by the physics . the important point to note",
    "is that it does not matter which form we use in this paper , either the kinetic or the granular form , because this term factors out from the sum in eq .",
    "[ sumrho ] and does not affect the results .",
    "thus , the results we obtain are valid for either granular or kinetic ensembles and we can compare the mathematical form derived for the _ stosszahlansatz _ in one case with the mathematical form derived in the other .",

    "similarly , if we apply this method to an ensemble of dilute gas collision networks ( in four space+time dimensions ) , then the phase space variables would not include the individual momentum vectors @xmath184 and @xmath185 for each collision , nor the outgoing momentum vectors @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "instead , it would consist of the sum of the incoming momentum vectors at each collision , @xmath188 , along with the colliding momentum vector angles prior to the collision , @xmath189 and @xmath190 and after the collision @xmath191 and @xmath192",
    ". the magnitudes of the incoming and outgoing momentum vectors could then be recovered by linear algebra and trigonometry .",
    "note that this differs from the granular case only in that there is one fewer conserved component of momentum than there are dimensions in the collision network : there are @xmath193 , @xmath194 and @xmath195 , but no @xmath196 corresponding to the time dimension . despite this difference ,",
    "the method works identically for both the granular and dilute gas cases .        in particular , if we leave out the fourth term from eq .",
    "[ microdos ] so that the ensemble reverts to an edwards ensemble , then in the thermodynamic limit essentially all of the packings in the ensemble will demonstrate a certain kind of relaxation in @xmath45 .",
    "any packings that have a different sequence @xmath45 without this relaxation will thus comprise a set of zero measure in the edwards ensemble .    in the case of the dilute gas",
    ", there is no steric exclusion .",
    "just as in the granular case , eliminating @xmath35 converts the ensemble from a set of closed - loop networks to a set of branching tree networks .",
    "the assumption is that correlation does not arise through closed - loops , and so eliminating @xmath35 will not affect the momentum statistics .",
    "indeed , the generalized _ stosszahlansatz _ applied to momentum networks reduces to boltzmann s _ stosszahlansatz _ when we assume that information propagates only in the forward - time direction , as shown in the appendix .",

    "<S> the theorem that follows from this is similar to boltzmann s @xmath1 theorem and is presented as an alternative to edwards hypothesis for explaining some granular phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> it identifies a very interesting feature of granular packings : if the generalized _ stosszahlansatz _ is correct , then the bulk of homogeneous granular packings must satisfy a maximum entropy condition simply by virtue of being stable , without any exploration of phase space required . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an independent derivation of the contact force statistics , and these predictions have been compared to numerical simulation data in the isotropic case . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement implies that the generalized _ stosszahlansatz _ is indeed accurate at least for the isotropic state of the idealized case studied here , and that it is the reductionist explanation for contact force statistics in this case . </S>"
