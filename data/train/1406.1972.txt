    "the notion of a motherbody of a solid domain or , more generally , of a positive borel measure was discussed both in geophysics and mathematics , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it was apparently pioneered in the 1960 s by a bulgarian geophysicist d.  zidarov @xcite and later mathematically developed by b.  gustafsson @xcite .",

    "the main efforts in this inverse problem since the foundational paper of p.  s.  novikov @xcite were concentrated around the question about the uniqueness of a ( solid ) body with a given exterior potential , see e.g. recent @xcite and @xcite and the references therein .",
    "p.  s.  novikov ( whose main mathematical contributions are in the areas of mathematical logic and group theory ) proved uniqueness for convex and star - shaped bodies with a common point of star - shapeness .",

    "these results together with a number of conjectures seem to indicate that it is quite difficult , in general , to answer when a given algebraic germ @xmath3 admits a motherbody measure and if it does then how many .    several concluding remarks are in place here .",
    "our interest in probability measures whose cauchy transforms are algebraic functions a.e . in @xmath0 was sparked by the pioneering work @xcite .",
