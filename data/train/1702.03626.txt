    "the cosmic distance - duality relation ( cddr ) was firstly proved by etherington in 1933  @xcite with two fundamental hypotheses , namely , that light travels always along null geodesics in a riemannian geometry , and the number of photons is conserved over the cosmic evolution  @xcite .",
    "it is also well known as etherington s reciprocity relation , and it connects two different metric distances through the following identity @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent luminosity distance ( ld ) and angular diameter distance ( add ) to a given source at redshift @xmath9 .",
    "being independent of einstein field equations and the nature of matter , this equation is generally valid for all cosmological models based on riemannian geometry , and it has been used , without any doubt , in astronomical observations and modern cosmology . however , a violation of one of the two fundamental hypotheses leading to the cddr might be possible , which might be viewed as a signal of exotic physics  @xcite .",
    "thus , testing validity of this relation with astronomical observational data is worthy and necessary .    up to now , different methods , involving the lds of type ia supernovae ( snia ) or gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ,",
    "add of galaxy clusters  @xcite , current cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations  @xcite , hubble parameter data @xmath10 , baryon acoustic oscillation measurements and gas mass fraction measurements in galaxy clusters  @xcite , are employed to investigate the validity of the cddr , and the results show that the cddr is consistent with the observations at different confidence levels ( cl )  @xcite",
    ". however , new methods with different astronomical observations offer new ways to test the cddr . recently ,",
    "new tests of cddr using the add ratio from strong gravitational lensing ( sgl )  @xcite have been performed with the snia union2.1 or jla compilation up to the redshifts @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the samples from sgl whose redshifts are beyond the snia redshift range were discarded due to lack of ld data points corresponding to the add data at the same redshifts .",

    "@xcite derived the modification of the light flux in the presence of a dilaton field , and showed that the cddr still hold true .",
    "then , with the latest snia data and the referred adds from bao measurements , they also performed a test on the cddr validity , and found no evidence of violation from cddr in the redshift range of @xmath12 .",
    "it should be noted that most of the previous validations of cddr , so far , have been carried out in the redshift range @xmath13 , since the add samples with redshifts @xmath14 are rare in the observational data .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the sgl data compilation  @xcite provides us with 33 samples whose source redshifts are in the region @xmath15 .",

    "the advantages of method b is that not only it takes the errors of all data points into account , but also it defines the confidence level effectively  @xcite .",
    "since we will obtain a continuous function of luminosity distance @xmath18 at any redshift @xmath9 , an other advantage of this method is that we can avoid any bias brought by redshifts incoincidence between add and ld samples , and so all of the sgl samples up to redshift @xmath19 are available with this method .",

    "in order to get the quantities of ld @xmath18 , the union2.1 compilation  @xcite comprising 580 data points between the redshift region @xmath42 is used in this paper , and the most distant snia scp-0401 at @xmath43  @xcite is also added to union2.1 samples . following the procedure of  @xcite , we added a 0.15 systematic error to the snia compilation .",

    "<S> in this paper , we perform a cosmological model - independent test of the cosmic distance - duality relation ( cddr ) in terms of the ratio of angular diameter distance ( add ) @xmath0 from strong gravitational lensing ( sgl ) and the ratio of luminosity distance ( ld ) @xmath1 obtained from the joint of type ia supernovae ( snia ) union2.1 compilation and the latest gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) data , where the superscripts s and l correspond to the redshifts @xmath2 and @xmath3 at the source and lens from sgl samples . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of combining grb data with snia compilation is to test cddr in a wider redshift range . </S>",
    "<S> the ld associated with the redshits of the observed add , is obtained through two cosmological model - independent methods , namely , method a : binning the snia+grbs data , and method b : reconstructing the function of dl by combining the crossing statistic with the smoothing method . </S>",
    "<S> we find that cddr is compatible with the observations at @xmath4 confidence level for the power law model which is assumed to describe the mass distribution of lensing systems with method b in a wider redshift range .    </S>",
