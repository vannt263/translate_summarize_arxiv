    "asteroids are small bodies orbiting the sun , scattered across the solar system with a large majority concentrated in the main belt region between the orbits of mars and jupiter .",
    "their orbital distribution and physical properties are a primary source of information for reconstructing the processes which led to the formation and evolution of the solar system @xcite .",
    "while the first asteroids were discovered over two centuries ago , most of the known asteroids have been discovered by dedicated surveys over the past two decades .",
    "these modern asteroid surveys have been tracking asteroids using robotic telescopes , charge - coupled device ( ccd ) detectors , and dedicated software that typically automates the bulk of the data acquisition and reduction while leaving the final decision on each detection to expert human observers .",
    "the ability to produce unbiased estimates of the population of asteroids relies in large part on accurately assessing the detection efficiency of the asteroid surveys @xcite .",
    "this is the main motivation to perform a comprehensive characterization of the modern asteroid surveys active over the past two decades .",
    "additionally , surveys can take advantage of this comparative analysis to assess the tradeoff of different observing strategies and setups .",
    "the detection efficiency is an important diagnostic , and surveys have adopted different approaches over time in order to determine it . in @xcite the detection efficiency of selected clear nights is determined for the near - earth asteroid tracking ( neat ) survey , by comparing the detected objects with the list of known objects , both as a function of apparent magnitude and apparent velocity ( angular rate ) of the asteroids . in @xcite the detection efficiency of individual fields near the ecliptic plane",
    "is determined for the lincoln near - earth asteroid research ( linear ) survey , also by comparing the detected objects with the list of known objects , but only as a function of apparent visual magnitude .",
    "the binned data are then fitted to a sigmoid curve . in @xcite",
    "a similar approach is followed to determine the detection efficiency of the catalina sky survey . when estimating the detection efficiency of telescopes with larger apertures and smaller fields of view , both and @xcite injected synthetic asteroids in their acquired fields in place of the insufficient number of known objects in the fields . in @xcite the detection efficiency for the neowise survey was determined by comparing detections with known objects in the field of view , as a function of the infrared magnitude at 12 and 22 @xmath0 m wavelengths .",
    "in this study we have included all available data from nine of the major asteroid surveys that have been active over the past two decades , all of which are ground - based except neowise , see table  [ tab : survey_properties ] and @xcite for a recent review .",
    "available data from the beginning of operations of each survey through august 2014 are included .",
    "the survey selection is dictated principally by the availability of a sufficient volume of data to allow a statistical treatment , such as a sufficient number of observations reported on each single night to reliably determine the detection efficiency parameters for that night , and a large enough number of nights to allow a characterization of the overall survey performance .",

    ". there may be instances in which observations of a potential asteroid are not linked to a know asteroid , neither they lead to constrain sufficiently well the orbit of a new asteroid .",
    "these so - called _",
    "one night stands _ are not considered detections until they are linked to known asteroids .",
    "this analysis includes several surveys and thus requires us to use a method to determine the detection efficiency that is generic enough to only require publicly available data , in order to be as inclusive as possible and to have the highest possible statistical significance .",
    "data from each survey are analyzed on a nightly basis , which implies that the varying observing conditions and related possible detection efficiency changes during the night are averaged into a single estimated detection efficiency for that night .",
    "this choice is dictated by the goal of using a sufficient amount of data that can be achieved when using a full night of data , but would not be possible if using shorter time intervals .",
    "all the input data are from the mpc : the asteroid observations are extracted from the ` numobs ` and ` unnobs ` databases , the orbits are from the ` mpcorb ` database , and the pointing from the ` skycov ` database .",
    "the asteroids with sufficiently well determined orbits are numerically propagated to the epoch of observation to determine their celestial coordinates , nominal apparent magnitude @xmath1 , and apparent velocity @xmath2 .",
    "the celestial coordinates are then matched against the sky coverage data to determine whether or not an asteroid enters the field of view ( fov ) of the survey during that night .",
    "the orbits are propagated numerically by integrating the equations of motion , using an efficient numerical integrator with variable timestep @xcite , and including gravitational perturbations from the planets , and then saved at intervals of 200 days .",
    "then the orbits are interpolated between the two closest 200-days epochs to the observation epoch .",
    "this results in an overall typical error in the position of the asteroids between 10 and 20 arcsec , which is sufficient for the purposes of this study , and it does not significantly affect the overall outcome .",
    "this choice allows one to reduce by approximately two orders of magnitude the computational costs related to the orbit propagation , and the level of accuracy allows the inclusion of orbits with runoff parameter smaller than 20 arcsec per decade , or mpc orbit uncertainty parameter @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "data are then binned in apparent magnitude @xmath1 and apparent velocity @xmath2 , between 14 and 24 with increments of 0.25 in @xmath1 , and between 0 and 100 arcsec / h with increments of 2 arcsec / h in @xmath2 .",
    "the ratio between detected asteroids @xmath4 and total asteroids @xmath5 present in the fov determines the detection efficiency @xmath6 for each bin : @xmath7 where @xmath8 . using binomial statistics we can estimate the uncertainty @xmath9 : @xmath10 which is particularly important here because the bin size is relatively small , so both @xmath4 and @xmath5 can have relatively large statistical fluctuations .",
    "the value of the nominal success probability @xmath11 of the binomial distribution is unknown in general for each bin , but we know that it tends asymptotically to @xmath12 for large @xmath5 , and that it must strictly avoid the singular values @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "a suitable choice is then @xmath15 so that the estimate @xmath16 is always well defined .    , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20  arcsec / hour , and @xmath21  arcsec / hour .",
    "the derived limiting magnitude in this example is @xmath22 , while the limiting apparent velocity is @xmath23  arcsec / hour . ]",
    "as we described in the introduction , there have been several approaches to fit the detection efficiency in the literature .",
    "here we choose to analyze its dependence on the apparent magnitude of asteroids as well as their rate of motion .",
    "the functional dependence on @xmath1 is adapted from @xcite , while the dependence of apparent velocity @xmath2 is a sigmoid function .",
    "so our choice is to model the detection efficiency as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the maximum value of the detection efficiency .",
    "the two other components express the dependence on apparent magnitude @xmath1 : @xmath26 and apparent velocity @xmath2 : @xmath27 the functions are limited between 0 and 1 , and we fix @xmath28 for @xmath29 . the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the sigmoid mid - points , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the widths over which the transition occurs .",
    "the confusion effect due to the increasing number of background stars is taken to be still negligible at @xmath34 and is regulated by the @xmath35 parameter .",
    "an example of the fitting of the detection efficiency data is included in figure  [ fig : plot_v_u ] .",
    "here we define the limiting magnitude @xmath36 as the magnitude at which @xmath37 and typically @xmath38 and their difference increases if @xmath39 or if there is a strong quadratic decay ( small @xmath35 ) . for this reason @xmath36",
    "is computed numerically , and it is not defined if @xmath40 . similarly we define @xmath41 as the apparent velocity at which @xmath37 , and @xmath42 .",
    "note that the detection efficiency for @xmath2 increases with the apparent velocity , so the limiting apparent velocity @xmath41 is a lower limit , not an upper limit .",
    "the process of determining the detection efficiency curve has been performed for all surveys in table  [ tab : survey_properties ] and for all the nights for which data were available .",
    "typically a number of asteroids of 100 or more needs to be observed in a single night in order for the fitting process to converge , and even then there may be several cases when the fit does not converge due to noisy data , and the night is discarded in that case .",
    "the statistics of nights for which data are available , and nights for which a good fit was obtained , is provided in table  [ tab : survey_properties ] , and overall we obtained good fits of 10,033 nights .",
    "data are typically more noisy in apparent velocity , especially for apparent velocities above approximately 40 arcsec / hour where the number of main belt asteroids drops and the statistics with it .",
    "additionally , there may be nights when the asteroid observing strategy tends to sample apparent velocities away from @xmath31 so the data constrain the curve only weakly .",
    "the limiting magnitude for the nights with satisfactory fitting are displayed in figure  [ fig : grid_v50_scatter ] , where one can appreciate the period of operation , seasonal and global trends for each survey .",
    "an online archive ] has been created with individual detailed reports for each night .",
    "an in - depth look at the detection efficiency data accumulated over the full performance period can confirm the dependence on apparent magnitude and apparent velocity , as well as reveal subtle structures that would otherwise be lost in the statistical noise of single - night data . as the plots in fig .",
    "[ fig : grid_v_u_data_3x3 ] show , the typical shape of the bold level curve corresponding to a detection efficiency @xmath43 confirms a posteriori the fact that the fitting function can be separated into two independent functions depending on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "not all surveys seem to reach detection efficiency close to 1.0 , even in the limit of bright asteroids .",
    "the detection efficiency typically shows a uniform front as we move left to right from almost apparently static asteroids to faster ones , and a modulation when approaching limiting magnitudes , slightly favoring asteroids up to approximately @xmath44  arcsec / h , which is the range of main belt asteroids .",
    "this effect can be somehow observed in data from individual nights , see e.g.  figure  [ fig : plot_v_u ] , but data from single nights are typically insufficient to obtain statistically robust fits of this effect .",
    "also , the noise in the data increases markedly above @xmath44  arcsec / h , that is due principally to the statistics .",
    "the distribution of nightly limiting magnitudes is provided in figure  [ fig : grid_v50_histo ] , along with the basic statistics .",
    "it is interesting to note that for most surveys the distribution clearly shows a slow rise and then a quick drop as we move left to right towards increasing @xmath36 values , resulting in skewed distributions .",
    "our average @xmath36 are in very good agreement with the average @xmath45 for 703 ( 19.44 ) and g96 ( 21.15 ) in @xcite , within @xmath46 magnitudes , where their @xmath45 is defined as the magnitude at which the efficiency drops to @xmath47 , leading to slightly higher values than our @xmath36 defined as the magnitude at which @xmath48 .    .",
    "the average and standard deviation is marked next to each distribution . ]",
    "the distribution of nightly limiting apparent velocities is provided in figure  [ fig : grid_u50_histo ] . here",
    "we see two groups of distributions : those compact at values higher than zero , and those with a significant component near zero .",
    "low @xmath41 values can indicate search strategies with an observing cadence re - visiting the same fov over a long time period , or can be a sign of reduced data resolution at low @xmath2 values and thus provide only weak constraints on @xmath41 .    .",
    "the average and standard deviation is marked next to each distribution . ]    in figure  [ fig : grid_eta0_histo ] we have the distribution of maximum detection efficiencies @xmath49 . here",
    "too we can see two groups of distributions : those strongly peaked towards @xmath50 , and those with a significant fraction of nights below 1.0 .",
    "the value of @xmath49 for neowise c51 is in generally good agreement with @xcite .",
    "however our values are significantly higher than the values for 703 ( 0.73 ) and g96 ( 0.88 ) provided in @xcite .",
    "the lower @xmath49 values in @xcite are probably due to them not including the apparent velocity in the fit of the detection efficiency",
    ". since both 703 and g96 have @xmath41 distribution values well above zero ( figure  [ fig : grid_u50_histo ] ) , this effect could be quite substantial in decreasing the apparent value of @xmath49 .",
    "on the other hand , this effect is minimal for c51 as their @xmath41 distribution is very close to zero .",
    "the lack of a slow quadratic decay term in the apparent magnitude fitting function can also contribute to underestimating the @xmath49 .    .",
    "the average and standard deviation is marked next to each distribution . ]    the limiting magnitude @xmath36 at which an asteroid survey operates depends primarily on the aperture @xmath51 of the telescope , with corrections from additional factors such as exposure time , weather conditions , and search strategies .",
    "here we have an opportunity to look at the general trend of @xmath36 versus @xmath51 having characterized each survey using exactly the same approach based on the same data sources .",
    "for consistency we limit this analysis to the 8 ground - based surveys included in this study , and then discuss the comparison with the only one space - based , neowise . in figure  [",
    "fig : v50_chisq ] we show the values of the limiting magnitude @xmath36 versus aperture @xmath51 . when restricted to these 8 ground - based surveys , the best fitting function is @xmath52 where @xmath51 is in meters and the uncertainties quoted are @xmath53 . in figure",
    "[ fig : v50_chisq ] the @xmath54 range of solutions , representing the 95% confidence region , is represented by the light gray area .",
    "the reduced chi - squared is @xmath55 , relatively high and indicates the difficulty to constrain the factor of the logarithm , mostly because of the limited range in aperture @xmath56  meters in the input data . to extend this aperture range",
    "we can include results from two large - aperture telescopes , the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) mayall telescope ( @xmath57  m ) , and the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) subaru telescope ( @xmath58  m ) .",
    "@xcite searched for asteroid for 6 nights in 2001 at the mayall telescope , and determined the detection efficiency for each night by injecting synthetic asteroids in their images and then reprocessing the images using the same pipeline used for real asteroids .",
    "when adapted to the conventions used in this manuscript , and after applying the standard filter correction @xmath59 , their overall limiting magnitude is estimated as @xmath60 .",
    "similarly performed asteroids search at the subaru telescope on a single night also in 2001 , and used synthetic asteroids to estimate the detection efficiency , and their overall limiting magnitude is estimated as @xmath61 .",
    "note that in both cases the nominal @xmath53 uncertainty of @xmath62 magnitudes is estimated using the average uncertainty of the other 8 ground - based surveys .",
    "the best fit for all 10 ground - based surveys is @xmath63 with a reduced chi - squared of @xmath64 , and represented by the intermediate gray area in figure  [ fig : v50_chisq ] .",
    "it is clear how these additional points help constrain the limiting magnitude at large aperture , with the logarithm factor now within less than @xmath53 from the theoretical value of 5 .",
    "if we fix the logarithm factor to be exactly 5 , we obtain @xmath65 with a reduced chi - squared of @xmath66 and represented by the dark gray area in figure  [ fig : v50_chisq ] .",
    "this last fit of eq .   should be considered the most robust of the three to estimate the expected performance of upcoming ground - based surveys . as figure  [ fig : v50_chisq ] shows ,",
    "small deviations are possible and due most likely to the details of the asteroid search operations .",
    "note that when large aperture telescopes search kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) the limiting magnitude can improve over eq .   by one magnitude or more , as the low apparent velocities allow longer exposure times @xcite . when considering infrared space surveys , the single neowise data point of @xmath67 at an aperture @xmath68  m allows us to obtain trivially the fitting curve @xmath69 where the statistical uncertainty is simply that of the input data , and the logarithm factor is fixed at its theoretical value .",
    "this indicates an improvement over ground - based optical surveys of approximately two magnitudes .     of ground - based asteroid surveys as a function of aperture @xmath51 .",
    "the data points in the left group ( @xmath70  m ) are from this work , while the point at @xmath57  m is based on @xcite with data from the kpno mayall telescope , and the point at @xmath58  m is based on with data from the naoj subaru telescope .",
    "the fitting dashed line is @xmath71 with @xmath51 in meters , and the gray regions mark the @xmath54 uncertainty of the fit under different assumptions ( see main text ) . ]",
    "we have presented a method to characterize the detection efficiency of asteroid surveys , and applied it to nine of the largest surveys active over the past two decades .",
    "the input data maintained by the minor planet center are freely available for all the surveys considered , and have been uniformly processed by our software pipeline , and this facilitates an unbiased characterization and aids in the goal of having the largest statistical significance .",
    "all surveys show large dispersions in limiting magnitude , limiting apparent velocity , and maximum efficiency over short periods , which underlines the importance of accurately following and modeling these parameters .",
    "this set of ten thousand well characterized observing nights represents a solid base towards producing debiased asteroid population studies .",
    "the dependence of the limiting magnitude on the aperture can deviate significantly from the nominal fitting curve , depending on the asteroid search strategy and observing conditions , but overall our estimate of eq .",
    "should represent a solid first - order expected limiting magnitude for current and future asteroid surveys .",
    "modeling the detection efficiency as a function of apparent magnitude and apparent velocity on a nightly basis generated solid fits . using",
    "only the apparent magnitude can lead to underestimating the overall efficiency for surveys which are significantly insensitive to apparently slow asteroids .",
    "more complex fitting functions could be tested over much longer periods than nightly in order to accumulate larger statistics , and could model the slow decay for fast moving objects , as well as dependence on the airmass or galactic latitude .",
