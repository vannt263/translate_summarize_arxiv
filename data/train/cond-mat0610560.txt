    "mesoscopic cavities show universal transport properties  such as conductance , conductance fluctuations , or shot noise  provided the classical dynamics inside the cavity is fully chaotic . here",
    "chaos may be due to either implanted impurities or bumpy boundaries .",
    "a phenomenological description of these universal features is available through random - matrix theory ( rmt ) by averaging over _ ensembles _ of systems ( whose hamiltonians are represented by matrices ) @xcite . for systems with impurities",
    ", one can alternatively average over different disorder potentials .",
    "however , experiments show that even _",
    "individual _ cavities show universal behavior faithful to these averages .    in the present paper",
    "we want to show why this is the case .",
    "to do so we propose a semiclassical explanation of universal transport through individual chaotic cavities , based on the interfering contributions of close classical trajectories .",
    "this approach generalizes earlier work in @xcite and is inspired by recent progress for universal spectral statistics @xcite .",
    "our semiclassical procedure often turns out to be technically easier than rmt ; transport properties are evaluated through very simple diagrammatic rules .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional cavity accommodating chaotic classical motion .",
    "two ( or more ) straight leads are attached to the cavity and carry currents .",
    "we shall mostly consider electronic currents , but most of the following ideas apply to transport of light or sound as well , minor modifications apart .",
    "the leads support wave modes ( `` channels '' ) @xmath0 ; the subscripts @xmath1 refer to the ingoing and outgoing lead , respectively , @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath4 are coordinates along and transversal to the lead . here , @xmath5 is the width of the lead , @xmath6 the wave number , and @xmath7 the angle enclosed between the wave vector and the direction of the lead .",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions inside the lead impose the restriction @xmath8 with the channel index @xmath9 running from 1 to @xmath10 , the largest integer below @xmath11 .",
    "classically , the @xmath9-th channel can be associated with trajectories inside the lead that enclose an angle @xmath7 with the lead direction , regardless of their location in configuration space .",
    "the sign of the enclosed angle changes after each reflection at the boundaries of the cavity , and angles of both signs are associated to the same channel .",
    "we shall determine , e.g. , the mean and the variance of the conductance as power series in the inverse of the number of channels @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast to much of the previous literature , we will go to all orders in @xmath13 .",
    "we shall be interested both in dynamics with time reversal invariance ( `` orthogonal case '' ) and without that symmetry ( `` unitary case '' ) . for electronic motion time reversal invariance",
    "may be broken by an external magnetic field .",
    "for that latter case , we shall also interpolate between both pure symmetry classes by account for a weak magnetic field producing magnetic actions of the order of @xmath14 .",
    "we will always work in the semiclassical limit , and thus require the linear dimension @xmath15 of the cavity to be large compared to the ( fermi ) wavelength @xmath16 .",
    "when taking the limit @xmath17 , the number of channels @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) will be increased only slowly .",
    "the width of the openings thus becomes small compared to @xmath15 .",
    "for this particular semiclassical limit , the dwell time of trajectories inside the cavity , @xmath20 grows faster than the so - called ehrenfest time @xmath21 .",
    "interesting effects arising for @xmath22 of order unity @xcite are thus discarded .    following landauer and bttiker @xcite",

    "each @xmath23 can be approximated semiclassically , by the van vleck approximation for the propagator , as a sum over trajectories connecting the channels @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath28 the channels exactly determine the absolute values of the initial and final angles of incidence @xmath29 of the contributing trajectories ; again both positive and negative angles are possible . in ( [ transition ] )",

    "the heisenberg time diverges in the semiclassical limit like @xmath33 with @xmath34 the volume of the energy shell and @xmath35 the number of degrees of freedom ; we shall mostly consider @xmath36 .",
    "the `` stability amplitude '' @xmath37 ( which includes the so - called maslov index ) can be found in richter s review @xcite . finally , the phase in ( [ transition ] ) depends on the classical action @xmath38 .",
    "within the framework just delineated , we will evaluate , for individual fully chaotic cavities ,    * the _ mean conductance _",

    "the angular brackets signify an average over an energy interval sufficient to smooth out the fluctuations of the respective physical property .",
    "we will see that after such an averaging each of these quantities takes a universal form in agreement with random - matrix theory , without any need for an ensemble average . to show this",
    ", we shall express the transition amplitudes as sums over trajectories as in ( [ transition ] ) .",
    "the above observables then turn into averaged sums over pairs or quadruplets of trajectories , which will be evaluated according to simple and universal diagrammatic rules .",
    "we shall first derive and exploit these rules for the orthogonal and unitary cases and then generalize to the interpolating case ( weak magnetic field ) .",
    "due to the unitarity of the time evolution , we could equivalently express transport properties through reflection amplitudes and trajectories starting and ending at the same lead .",
    "for the average conductance we have checked explicitly that the same result is obtained , meaning that our approach preserves unitarity .",
    "we first consider the mean conductance and propose to show that individual chaotic systems are faithful to the random - matrix prediction @xcite @xmath47 in the semiclassical approximation ( [ transition ] ) , the average conductance becomes a double sum over trajectories @xmath48 connecting the same channels @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath49 due to the phase factor @xmath50 , the contributions of most trajectory pairs oscillate rapidly in the limit @xmath51 , and vanish after averaging over the energy .",
    "systematic contributions can only arise from pairs with action differences @xmath52 of the order of @xmath14 .",
    "the simplest such pairs involve _ identical trajectories _ @xmath53 , with a vanishing action difference @xcite .",
    "these `` diagonal '' pairs contribute @xmath54 the foregoing single - trajectory sum may be evaluated using the following rule established by richter and sieber @xcite : summation over trajectories connecting fixed channels is equivalent to integration over the dwell time @xmath55 as @xmath56 here , the integrand @xmath57 can be understood as the _ survival probability _ ,",
    "i.e. , the probability for the trajectory to remain inside the cavity up to the time @xmath55 .",
    "the factor @xmath58 is the classical escape rate . due to @xmath59 ,",
    "that rate is proportional to @xmath60 if @xmath61 is scaled according to @xmath62 ; inversion yields the typical dwell time @xmath63 mentioned in the introduction .    finally summing over all @xmath64 possible choices for @xmath24 and over the @xmath65 possibilities for @xmath25",

    "@xmath68 divides the encounter in two parts with durations @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the relevant trajectories are in reality much longer than depicted here ; in the absence of a potential they consist of a huge number of straight segments reflected at the boundary . ]    for the orthogonal case , richter and sieber attributed the next - to - leading order to another family of trajectory pairs . in the following",
    ", we shall describe these pairs in a language adapted to an extension to higher orders in @xmath13 . in each richter / sieber pair ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rs ] ) , the trajectory @xmath73 contains a `` 2-encounter '' wherein two stretches are almost mutually time - reversed ; in configuration space it looks like either a small - angle self - crossing or a narrow avoided crossing .",
    "we demand that these two stretches come sufficiently close such that their motion is mutually linearizable . along @xmath73 ,",
    "the two stretches are separated from each other and from the leads by three `` links . ''",
    "the partner trajectory @xmath67 is distinguished from @xmath73 only by differently connecting these links inside the 2-encounter . along the links",
    ", however , @xmath67 is practically indistinguishable from @xmath73 ; in particular , the entrance and exit angles of @xmath73 and @xmath67 ( defined by the in- and out - channels ) coincide . between two given in- and out - channels and demand therefore that all contributing trajectories have the same in- and out - angles .",
    "an alternative @xcite is to replace summation over channels in the formula for the transport property by integration ; then the channel numbers of the contributing trajectories found through an additional saddle point approximation will not be integer . ]",
    "the initial and final links are traversed in the same sense of motion by @xmath73 and @xmath67 , while for the middle link the velocities are opposite .",
    "obviously , such richter / sieber pairs @xmath48 can exist only in time - reversal invariant systems .",
    "the two trajectories in a richter / sieber pair indeed have nearly the same action , with the action difference originating mostly from the encounter region .",
    "we stress that inside a richter / sieber pair , the encounter stretches and the leads must be _ separated by links of positive durations _ @xmath74 .",
    "for the `` inner '' loop with duration @xmath75 the reasons were worked out in previous publications dealing with periodic orbits ( @xcite , and @xcite for more complicated encounters ) : essentially , @xmath67 is obtained from @xmath73 by switching connections between four points where the encounter stretches begin and end ; to have four such points the stretches must be separated by a non - vanishing link . the fact that the duration of the initial and final links is non - negative ( the encounter does not `` stick out '' through any of the openings ) is trivial in the case of the richter / sieber pair : since the encounter stretches are almost antiparallel a trajectory with an encounter `` sticking out '' would enter and exits the cavity through the same opening and thus be irrelevant for the conductance .",
    "encounters have an important effect on the _ survival probability _ @xcite .",
    "the trajectory @xmath73 is exposed to the `` danger '' of getting lost from the cavity only during the three links and on the first stretch of the encounter .",
    "if the first stretch remains inside the cavity , the second stretch , being close to the first one ( up to time reversal ) must remain inside as well . if we denote the duration of one encounter stretch by @xmath76 , the total `` exposure time '' is thus given by @xmath77 ; it is shorter than the dwell time @xmath55 which includes a second summand @xmath76 representing the second encounter stretch .",
    "consequently , the survival probability @xmath78 exceeds the naive estimate @xmath79 . in brief",
    ", encounters hinder the loss of a trajectory to the leads .",
    "to describe the _ phase - space geometry _ of a 2-encounter , we consider a poincar section @xmath68 orthogonal to the first encounter stretch in an arbitrary phase - space point @xmath69 .",
    "this section must also intersect the second stretch in a phase - space point @xmath70 almost time - reversed with respect to @xmath69 . in fig .",

    "if @xmath68 moves along the trajectory , following the time evolution of @xmath69 , the unstable component @xmath84 will grow exponentially while the stable component @xmath85 shrinks exponentially . for times large compared with the ballistic time ( @xmath86 with @xmath87 the velocity ) the rate of growth ( or shrinking ) is given by the lyapunov exponent @xmath16 ( not to be confused with the wavelength also denoted by @xmath16 ) , @xmath88    by our definition of a 2-encounter , the stable and unstable components are confined to ranges @xmath89 , @xmath90 , with @xmath91 a small phase - space separation .",
    "the exact value of @xmath91 will be irrelevant , except that the transverse size of the encounter in configuration space , @xmath92 with @xmath93 the mass , must be small compared with the opening diameters",
    ". it should also be small enough to allow mutual linearization of motion along the encounter stretches . as a consequence ,",

    "our semiclassical techniques can be expanded to a huge class of transport problems , for cavities with arbitrary numbers of leads , and observables involving arbitrary powers of transition matrices .",

    "proceeding as in subsections [ sec : conductance_general ] and [ sec : quadruplets ] , we represent the contribution of each family as a sum over the trajectories @xmath654 and an integral over the density of stable and unstable coordinates , @xmath655 here , @xmath656 is obtained by integrating @xmath657 over the durations of all links except the final link of each of the @xmath658 trajectories .",
    "doing the sum over @xmath659 with the richter / sieber rule , we find the same link and encounter integrals as before , and thus a contributions @xmath13 from each link and a contribution @xmath132 from each encounter .",
    "the same rule applies for products slightly different from ( [ general_observable ] ) .",
    "first , if some of the channels @xmath660 or some of the channels @xmath661 coincide ( as in many examples studied in the main part ) some of the subscripts in ( [ general_observable ] ) will appear not twice but @xmath662 times .",
    "we then have to consider all possible ways to pair these subscripts . in the spirit of wick s theorem ,",
    "each of these possibilities contributes separately .",
    "( note that , if a subscript appears an odd number of times , the corresponding product can not be related to multiplets of trajectories , and may be expected to vanish after averaging over the energy ) .",
    "second , in the orthogonal case the two subscripts of one @xmath329 or @xmath663 in ( [ general_observable ] ) may be interchanged without affecting the final result ; the corresponding trajectory is then reverted in time .    with these rules",
    ", one can evaluate a huge class of observables relevant for quantum transport .",
    "for each single application , only the counting of families remains to be mastered .",
    "we here want to reformulate our previous results on spectral statistics @xcite in the present language of diagrammatic rules . in contrast to @xcite , we start from the level staircase @xmath664 , defined as the number of energy eigenvalues below @xmath665 . @xmath664 can be split into a smooth local average @xmath666 and an fluctuating part @xmath667 describing fluctuations around that average .",

    ", we replace the sum over @xmath206 by an integral over a density @xmath685 of phase - space separations inside @xmath204 .",
    "similarly as for transport @xmath112 is defined as the integral of @xmath686 over all piercing times ; integration over the first piercing time leads to multiplication with the orbit period , whereas the remaining integrals can be transformed into integrals over all link durations but one .",
    "approximating @xmath687 and @xmath688 , we find @xmath689 we here divided out @xmath15 , because for each orbit pair any of the @xmath15 links may be chosen as the `` first '' ; without this division , each pair would be counted @xmath15 times .",
    "the sum over @xmath204 can now be done using the sum rule of hannay and ozorio de almeida @xcite , @xmath690 the multiplication with the orbit period is thus replaced by integration over the period or , equivalently , over the duration of the remaining link .",
    "writing @xmath691 , we can now split ( [ integral_c ] ) into the prefactor @xmath692 , an integral @xmath693 for each link and an integral @xmath694 for each encounter ; to ensure convergence we assume @xmath413 to have an infinitesimal positive imaginary part .",
    "since all @xmath30 s cancel , we obtain a factor @xmath695 for each link , and a factor @xmath696 for each @xmath136-encounter .",
