    "despite much study of the formation and evolution of young t  tauri stars , many questions remain concerning some of their most fundamental characteristics .",
    "understanding the few million years of evolution between the protostellar and post t  tauri stages , including circumstellar disk accretion , planet formation , and disk dissipation , is crucial to understanding the formation of the solar system and extra - solar planetary systems .",
    "one key approach to resolving these issues is striking a balance between in - depth studies of individual star - forming regions and observations of a variety of star - forming regions that differ in age , distance , stellar density , binary fraction , etc .",
    "the presence of t  tauri stars in a region indicates an age of 1@xmath410 million years , the timescale for disk dissipation and the formation of gas giant planets around low mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "t  tauri stars are primarily identified by h@xmath7 emission , ir and uv continuum excess , variability , and surrounding nebulosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after 50 years of study , the young , low mass multiple star system as  353 , in the constellation aquila , remains enigmatic .",
    "a @xmath05  pair , the system appears to be a mixed t  tauri binary , with the more massive component , as  353a , showing signatures of a classical t  tauri star ( ctts ) , which is defined as having ew(h@xmath7 )  @xmath8  10    and excess infrared emission above the continuum level @xcite .",
    "the secondary , as  353b , was classified as a weak - lined t  tauri star ( wtts , ew(h@xmath7 )  @xmath9  10   ) , but has recently been resolved into a subarcsecond binary @xcite . as  353ba was reclassified by @xcite as a ctts ( but see  4.5.1 for further discussion ) . as  353 is the exciting source of herbig - haro object hh  32 , a highly collimated bipolar outflow ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and one of the only herbig - haro objects detected in 3.6 and 6  cm radio continuum @xcite . radio continuum emission has also been detected from the stars themselves , most recently attributed to the secondary rather than the primary @xcite .",
    "the age of the as  353 system was most recently determined by @xcite based on the location of as  353b relative to the pre@xmath4main - sequence evolutionary tracks of @xcite .",
    "this analysis resulted in an age of 5@xmath1010@xmath11 years / l@xmath12 ) for as  353b .",
    "data in the tables and text are accurate . ] , or 1@xmath1010@xmath13 years if the binary nature of as  353b is taken into account ( see appendix b of @xcite ) .",
    "in this current paper we provide an updated discussion of the age of the as  353 system as well as best estimates for the other objects in our sample (  4.2 ) .",
    "in addition to as  353b , there are five t  tauri stars listed in the herbig and bell catalog ( 1988 , hereafter hbc ) that are within @xmath015  of as  353a , all between galactic latitudes of @xmath14  =  @xmath41  to  @xmath46 .",
    "their projected location in the crowded galactic plane complicates the study of these stars , as well as the search for additional young stars in the region .",
    "few of the hbc aquila objects have radial velocities or @xmath15 listed in the catalog , but from spectra with resolution lower than the observations presented here and/or using emission lines instead of absorption lines , with results that have uncertainties on the order of tens of km  s@xmath5 or more @xcite .",
    "the original motivation for this project was to search for radial velocity variations in a sample of ctts and wtts in the vicinity of as  353a as a means of identifying spectroscopic binaries . for double - lined spectroscopic binary systems , the relative velocity of each component ,",
    "the mass ratio , and the center of velocity of the system can be determined .",
    "obtaining dynamical masses of young stars is critical to the study of star formation because mass is the most fundamental of all stellar parameters , and evolutionary models that relate young star masses and ages with the observables l and t@xmath16 are not yet calibrated .",
    "furthermore , absolute radial velocities are important for determining if the young stars in the sample are actually related , i.e. if they were formed in the same molecular cloud .",
    "if they were , then it is expected that they have a low velocity dispersion relative to one another as well as with respect to the associated cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "high resolution infrared spectra , even a single echelle order , can reveal much more than radial velocities . in this study ,",
    "what were assumed to be typical classical or weak - lined t  tauri stars were found to be surprisingly active systems with high rotational velocities , strong veiling , and unusual emission lines .",
    "thus the goals of this project broadened to include the measurement of @xmath15 , determination of spectral type , and characterization of the circumstellar environments of the targets , in addition to the radial velocity measurements .",
    "the sample is introduced in  2.1 , and the nirspec observations and their reduction are described in   2.2 and 2.3 , respectively .",
    "the data analysis , including line identification , determination of spectral type and @xmath15 , and measurements of radial velocity variability and absolute radial velocity , are described in3 .",
    "the results are discussed in  4 , including details of circumstellar environment , age , membership , and multiplicity .",
    "a summary appears in  5 along with suggestions for further studies of the aquila star - forming region .",
    "the targets were selected from the third catalog of emission - line stars of the orion population ( hbc ) because of their spatial proximity to the well - studied t  tauri star as  353a ( hbc  292 ) and its companion , as  353b ( hbc  685 ) . the names , coordinates , @xmath1-band magnitudes , and equivalent width of h@xmath7 emission for each object are listed in table  [ table : coords ] .",

    "we adopt a distance of 200  pc  @xmath6  30  pc (  4.2 ) , which is consistent with both the most recent distance estimate to as  353 ( 150@xmath650  pc , @xcite ) and to the dark cloud complex associated with hbc  294 ( 230@xmath630 , @xcite ) .",

    "targets with previously determined spectral types range from early k to early m @xcite ; several have been revised as a result of the work described in this paper .    as originally selected the sample consisted of six objects : hbc 292 , 294 , 681 , 682 , 683 , and 684 . during the course of the observations and subsequent analysis ,",
    "the sample has grown to nine objects .",
    "hbc  682 was discovered to be a 1  visual binary upon the first observation with nirspec . as  353b was added to the sample in order to strengthen its association , using radial velocity measurements , with as  353a .",

    "may 27 and 28 ( ut ) the observations were made using nirspec behind the keck adaptive optics system @xcite .    a @xmath2-band spectrum was obtained for each object on either 2003 september 07 ( hbc numbers 294 , 681 , 682a&b , 683 , and 684 ) or 2004",
    "november 22 ( as  353a ) . as  353b and fg",

    "table  [ table : obslog ] provides an observing log ; instrument settings for all observations are summarized in table  [ table : inst ] .      for data reduction we used the redspec code , a package of idl procedures created specifically for the reduction of nirspec spectra by s. kim , l. prato , and i. mclean .",

    "we determined the dispersion solution with a target star frame using oh night sky emission lines @xcite or an arc lamp frame .",
    "the latter approach was necessary for the ao data because the night sky oh emission lines are too faint in the target frames .",
    "based on the error analysis reported in @xcite , we assign an uncertainty of 1  km  s@xmath5 to the dispersion of each target .",
    "we used @xmath1-band order 49 ( 1.545  -  1.567  @xmath18 ) for the radial velocity measurements because of the presence of many narrow atomic and molecular absorption lines and the lack of telluric absorption lines .",
    "therefore , no division by a telluric a0 star was needed for order 49 spectra . in our @xmath2-band analysis",
    "we focused on the br@xmath21 line in order 35 ( 2.159  -  2.190  @xmath18 ) ; orders 33 , 36 and 37 were also reduced .",
    "reduction of order 35 was complicated by the presence of the broad br@xmath21 absorption in the telluric a0 star spectrum . to remove this intrinsic spectral feature",
    "while retaining the telluric features , we reduced the order 35 a0 star spectrum leaving the broad br@xmath21 and narrow terrestrial features intact . in a second reduction , we interpolated over the narrow telluric absorption lines only , leaving the br@xmath21 feature intact .",
    "the a0 star spectra resulting from these two reductions were then subtracted and the difference spectrum was renormalized to a continuum of 1.0 , creating a spectrum of telluric features only .",

    "the spectral types are accurate to at least two subclasses ; there are templates for about every second subclass , but the difference between the template spectra is generally well - defined , especially in the fe and oh lines mentioned above .    because of veiling of the object spectra by continuum emission from reprocessing in circumstellar disks and accretion - induced excesses , cross - correlation yields an artificial best fit for high values of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath15 of each object was determined by visual inspection and comparison to rotated spectral templates alone .",
    "the spectral type and @xmath15 for each object in the sample appear in table  [ table : results ] .",
    "radial velocities were measured by cross - correlating the target spectra with the best fit template spectrum from @xcite .",
    "spectra of hbc  684 were inverted because the typical absorption lines appear in emission for this object ( see  4.5.5 ) . before cross - correlation , spectra were converted to the heliocentric reference frame , interpolated onto the same wavelength basis as the matching template spectrum , and rebinned by a factor of ten .",
    "because of the strong br16 emission line in order 49 , a different approach was used to measure the radial velocity of as  353a .",
    "absorption lines are more reliable for the measurement of radial velocity of an object because emission lines are produced by accretion flows or stellar winds , which have their own characteristic radial velocities .",
    "therefore , we avoided the strong br16 emission line in the spectra of as  353a and used only the absorption lines shortward and longward of br16 in the cross - correlation .    to estimate the uncertainties in the radial velocity measurements , the target spectra were cross - correlated with five template spectra of varying rotational velocity and spectral type , including the best - fit template .",
    "the standard deviation of the resulting radial velocity measurements was less than 2  km  s@xmath5 for all targets other than hbc  682a and hbc  684 . for several targets the standard deviation of measurements was less than 1  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "we therefore adopt an uncertainty in the measurement of 2  km  s@xmath5 for all targets .",
    "this is consistent with the more formal uncertainties for the same method derived by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we measured each object s radial velocity at every epoch observed .",

    "the standard deviation and the number of epochs for each target appear in columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) of table  [ table : results ] .",
    "no average radial velocity is reported for hbc  682a because of the large variations between epochs .",
    "standard deviations are not given for fg  aql / g3 and hbc  685 because only one observation of each object was made .",
    "targets were initially examined for radial velocity variability by cross - correlating spectra taken at different epochs . for all objects except hbc  682a ,",
    "radial velocity variations were less than @xmath04  km  s@xmath5 , with typical values around 1@xmath42  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this is within the estimated uncertainty of the radial velocity measurements .",
    "radial velocity variations for hbc  682a were as large as 12  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "velocity shifts between spectra from ao and non - ao observations were systematically higher than the typical velocity shifts between non - ao spectra from different epochs .",
    "this may be the result of the different approach to the dispersion solution necessary with ao observations .",
    "the oh night sky lines used for the non - ao dispersion are distributed regularly throughout order 49 , allowing for an excellent solution .",
    "the arc lamp lines required for the ao observations dispersion solution are only four and their distribution across order 49 is sparse .",

    "although the vertical error bars are large because of the uncertain distances to the objects , the location of the ensemble on the h - r diagram suggests that most of the objects are approximately 1  myr old .",

    "higher sampling frequency observations are needed to determine its mass ratio and and center of mass velocity .",
    "however , we speculate that hbc  682a is a probable member of the aquila association because of its proximity to hbc  682b ( @xmath01 ) .",

    "the detection of as  353 by the _ iras _ satellite ( _ iras _  19181@xmath171056 ; the components are unresolved in the _ iras _ beam ) also points to the presence of warm dust in the system @xcite . however , as  353a lies _ below _ the ctts locus , which may be the result of abundant scattered light in the circumstellar environment or a blue component of excess continuum emission from accretion flows . as  353b",
    "does not show ir excess on the color - color diagram , which is consistent with its classification as a wtts based on the strength of its h@xmath7 emission .",
    "however , the extinction is larger than that of other cluster members if it is dereddened to the ctts locus .",
    "the prominent neutral hydrogen emission from as  353a is likely a combination of accretion and stellar winds .",
    "emission is the primary characteristic used to identify circumstellar accretion @xcite .",
    "however , a strong stellar wind is indicated by other characteristics of this system , namely , that it is the exciting source of hh  32 , a system of bright , compact emission line regions that are produced by a highly collimated bi - polar outflow @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath7 emission from as  353a also displays a p  cygni profile with absorption in the blue wing of the emission line @xcite , which indicates outflow from the star .",
    "the similar radial velocity measurements of as  353a and b ( @xmath411.4 and @xmath410.7  km  s@xmath5 , respectively ) and similar proper motions measured by @xcite make it likely that they are indeed a bound pair .",
    "therefore , as  353 is a mixed t  tauri system in which the more massive component is a ctts while the secondary is a wtts , which is thought to be more evolved than a ctts .",
    "the slight infrared excess implied by the @xmath31 color of as  353ba by @xcite , 0.56 magnitudes , suggests the possible presence of circumstellar material around at least one of the as  353b components .",
    "however , if the @xmath2- and @xmath32-band magnitudes for as  353ba are dereddened by an a@xmath33 of 2 magnitudes @xcite , the resultant k@xmath4l color is 0.44 magnitudes . for an a@xmath33 of 3 magnitudes ( this paper ) , the dereddened k@xmath4l color is 0.37 magnitudes . therefore , if circumstellar material is present at all around as  353ba , it is likely to be found at an advanced stage of dispersion .",
    "possibly the binarity of as  353b has played a role in the relatively early dissolution of its circumstellar disks .",
    "it has been suggested that as  353a is also a close binary @xcite .",
    "if true , this would complicate the idea that binarity drives accelerated disk evolution , as as  353a harbors one of the most substantial and active circumstellar disks known .",
    "@xcite find no evidence for a companion object down to a separation of 0.1@xmath34 , corresponding to 20  au for a distance of 200  pc to the system .",
    "if we assign as  353a a mass of 1.2  m@xmath12 ( figure  [ fig : hrd ] ) , the velocity signature induced by a companion object with a mass of 0.8  m@xmath12 in a circular orbit is about 7.5  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "any higher mass companion would result in a larger amplitude of radial velocity variability in as  353a , whereas any inclination of the system s orbit out of the plane of our line of sight , a larger distance to the system than 200  pc , or a smaller mass companion , would result in smaller amplitude velocity variations . over an interval of two years ,",
    "however , no radial velocity variation greater than 1  @xmath3 was measured between our three observations . our observations",
    ", however , may be insensitive to highly eccentric spectroscopic binary orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hbc  294 is best fit by a k7 template spectrum with @xmath15=25  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this agrees with the spectral type reported in the hbc .",
    "the radial velocity is well - determined , with a standard deviation of @xmath9  0.5  km  s@xmath5 based on measurements from three different epochs .",
    "hbc  294 , also known as v536  aql , is a typical ctts , with br@xmath21 emission detected in our @xmath2-band observations and h@xmath7 , pa@xmath35 , and optical forbidden emission lines reported in the literature , indicative of accretion from a circumstellar disk .",
    "@xcite describe evidence for a bipolar outflow from the system as well .",
    "@xcite first discovered hbc 294 to be a binary with an 052 separation at a position angle of 17 .",
    "the unresolved near - ir excess observed in the system indicates warm dust surrounding at least one of the stars .",
    "the _ iras _ psc flux measurements of hbc  294 ( _ iras _  19365 + 1023 ) reveal even greater mid- to far - ir fluxes than those of as  353a at all but 100  @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether the circumstellar material is located around one or both components of this binary .",
    "the lower 100  @xmath36 m flux suggests that circumstellar material is truncated by the binary companion .",
    "the extinction required to deredden hbc  294 to the ctts locus is comparable to the average extinction of the sample .    a k5 template with @xmath15=20  km  s@xmath5 provided the best fit to the spectrum of hbc  681 .",
    "the h@xmath7 emission of hbc  681 , ew=35   , is relatively low for the ctts in this sample , but still well above the 10    ctts limit .",
    "a clear ir excess is indicated by the location of hbc  681 on the color - color diagram .",
    "we identified a faint potential companion to hbc  681 at separation @xmath012 and a position angle of @xmath0195@xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath28 color of this object is @xmath00.3@xmath40.4 , typical of an unreddened m6 star , which , at the age of the aquila association , would be substellar .",
    "however , the proper motion of this object must be observed to determine if the two objects are indeed related as hbc  681 is located in the direction of the galactic plane , and hence the field is crowded with faint background objects .    for the spectrum of hbc  683 , we found a best fit using a k7 template spectrum with @xmath15=15  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this is later than the spectral type of k1 reported in the hbc .",
    "the 2003 september 08 ( ut ) order 49 spectrum of hbc  683 is one of the best for line identification because of the high signal to noise ratio and low @xmath15 relative to the rest of the sample .",
    "hbc  683 is a typical ctts and has the strongest h@xmath7 and br@xmath21 emission in our sample after as  353a .",
    "hbc  683 also shows a clear ir excess in the color - color diagram ( figure  [ fig : ccd ] ) .",
    "these properties are all consistent with its ctts classification and the presence of an actively accreting circumstellar disk .      as a result of the observations presented in this paper , hbc  682",
    "was discovered to be a visual binary with a separation of @xmath01 .",
    "hbc  682a is best fit by a k5 template spectrum with @xmath15=50  km  s@xmath5 , and hbc  682b by a k7 template spectrum with @xmath15=30  km  s@xmath5 . both of these spectral types are earlier than that of m0 reported in the hbc .",
    "although the spectra of both components of hbc  682 have similar @xmath1- and @xmath2-band features , there are striking rotational and radial velocity differences between the two .",
    "hbc  682a has the broadest absorption lines in our sample , while hbc  682b is more typical .",
    "a consistent radial velocity was not measured for hbc  682a because of the large variations between epochs ( table  [ table : radvels ] ) .",
    "this may be in part because of the wide and shallow absorption lines that make precise measurement of radial velocity more difficult .",
    "however , the radial velocity variations measured in 5 different epochs , were significantly larger than the typical variation for other objects , e.g. , 1@xmath42  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "hbc  682a is therefore a candidate spectroscopic binary .",
    "we speculate that hbc  682a and b are bound because of their close proximity .",
    "verification by component proper motion measurements and by determination of the center of mass velocity of the hbc  682a spectroscopic binary is needed , particularly in that this system is located in projection on to the galactic plane and hence confusion with background sources is possible .",
    "the angularly unresolved hbc  682 system shows no ir excess , consistent with its weak h@xmath7 and lack of br@xmath21 emission .",
    "however , the classification of hbc  682 is complicated by the fact that it has only recently been resolved into a visual binary , and may in fact be a hierarchical triple .",
    "the components lack separate h@xmath7 emission measurements and resolved near - ir photometry , both of which might provide additional information about their individual circumstellar environments .      an m0 template with @xmath15=15",
    "km  s@xmath5 provided the best fit to the fg  aql / g3 system .",
    "the only observations of this object since @xcite are from _ 2mass _ and _ denis _ ( deep near infrared survey ) , which combined provide @xmath38- , @xmath30- , @xmath1-and @xmath2-band photometry .",
    "no ir excess is detected .",
    "there are as yet no known signatures of youth associated with fg  aql / g3 ; @xcite did not detect h@xmath7 emission from this star and we did not observe it in the @xmath2-band . the @xmath1-band spectrum , however , appears highly veiled .",
    "the location within 20  of three cluster members and fg  aql / g3 s measured radial velocity are consistent with cluster membership .",
    "however , further evidence is needed to confirm the youth of this object .",
    "the spectra from the three observations of hbc  684 are presented in figure  [ fig : hbc684 ] .",
    "the inverted order 49 spectrum of hbc  684 is best fit by a k5 template spectrum with @xmath15=40  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the source of the emission lines in the spectra of this star is enigmatic .",
    "an examination of the fits files revealed that the emission lines appeared in the raw data .",
    "furthermore , emission lines were apparent in all orders of the raw @xmath1- and @xmath2-band data .",
    "although emission lines associated with accretion are common for young stars , they are usually manifested in strong hydrogen lines and only occasionally in other species , such as co and neutral na @xcite .",
    "hbc  684 shows only modest h@xmath7 ( 11    in the hbc and @xmath013    in our unpublished visible light spectrum ) and br@xmath21 emission , while most of the atomic lines in order 49 , mainly fe but possibly ti , si , and ni as well , all appear in emission .",
    "we have tentatively identified lines of oh and cn also in emission ; see figure  [ fig : hbc684 ] and table  [ table : lines ] for line identifications .",
    "in addition to these molecular lines in order 49 , many emission lines probably arising from oh were identified in orders 46 , 47 , 48 , and 50 , and several emission lines from cn in orders 48 and 50 .",

    "04239@xmath172436 in taurus .",
    "although the resolution was modest ( r@xmath0500 ) , over a dozen emission features were identified in the observed spectral range of 1.1  to  2.5  @xmath18 .",
    "probable features included several co bandheads , br@xmath21 , br10 , br11 , br13 , br14 , pa@xmath35 , h@xmath22 , and neutral he .",
    "only the neutral ca triplet at @xmath19=2.26  @xmath18 was observed in absorption .",

    "the palomar observatory sky survey and _ 2mass _ images show some nebulosity to the north and east of hbc  684 ; however , this diffuse emission was not evident in more recent @xmath1-band images ( in short , 0.1s exposures ) taken with the nirspec slit - viewing camera ( scam ) in 2004 november .",
    "hbc  684 is an _ iras _ source ( _ iras _",
    "19046@xmath170508 ) with psc fluxes at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100  @xmath18 even greater than those of as  353a , which indicates a considerable amount of warm dust around the star .",
    "the near - ir excess of hbc  684 is the strongest in our sample ( figure  [ fig : ccd ] ) .",
    "we suggest four mechanisms that might produce spectra such as those observed in hbc  684 .",
    "first , accretion could be creating an oblique shock close to the photosphere of the star , which occurs when the accretion speed equals the escape velocity of the star .",
    "however , the lack of strong h@xmath7 emission limits the amount of circumstellar material that could be accreting from a circumstellar disk .",
    "furthermore , our h@xmath7 spectrum shows a clear p  cygni profile , characteristic of outflow , but not infall .",
    "hbc  684 s emission lines could also be produced by an inversion layer resembling the chromosphere of the sun .",
    "if some blocking mechanism such as a circumstellar disk , similar to the function of the moon during total solar eclipse , could be construed , a phenomenon resembling a solar flash spectra might be produced ( see * ? ? ?",
    "stellar chromospheres are heated by stellar coronae ; the x - ray emission frequently observed in young stars is thought to originate in the corona ( * ? ? ? * e.g. ) .",
    "however , the nearest known x - ray source in the vicinity of hbc  684 , 1rxs j190722.4@xmath17051231 in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey faint source catalog , is 3.2  away and is therefore probably not associated with hbc  684 .",
    "a transient impact on the photosphere could provide sufficient energy to excite the atomic metals that are observed in emission .",
    "in 1994 july fragments of the comet shoemaker - levy  9 plunged into the atmosphere of jupiter .",
    "@xcite observed the plume of the most energetic impact and found atomic emission lines from neutral na , fe , ca , li in the optical spectrum .",
    "infrared spectra of another impact show molecular band / line emission , including ch@xmath39 and co(2@xmath40 ) @xcite .",
    "given the few million year age of this association and the evidence for circumstellar material around hbc  684 , it is plausible that planetessimals are forming around and may occasionally fall into the star . indeed , the planet plunging phenomenon proposed to account for the high metallicity observed in extra - solar planetary systems @xcite may be invoked in this case .",
    "the slow motion merger of a giant planet or brown dwarf could create the requisite energy for the fe  i emission lines ( on the order of 6@xmath47  ev ) without exciting significant hydrogen emission .",
    "such a merger would require a substantial circumstellar disk in order to abet angular momentum transfer ; the presence of a disk is supported by the strong near- and mid - ir excesses observed in this system .",
    "the p  cygni profile in the h@xmath7 emission line implies an outflow of 200  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "a planet plunging event might stimulate the velocity of such a jet .",
    "the duration of the effects of a merger is not known ; we have observed consistent emission line spectra of hbc  684 on three separate occasions over a 14 month period . in 1981 , a broad , strong p  cygni profile was already present ( notes in hbc ) .",
    "a final possibility we consider is the stimulation of line emission by fluorescence .",
    "we found that the upper energy level terms for the order 49 fe  i lines represent too broad a range of states for the production of all the @xmath1-band lines to be consistent with fluorescence originating in one particular pumping line .",
    "furthermore , all the lines expected in a normal k5 star are present in the infrared spectra of hbc  684 , except in emission .",
    "compare this , for example , to hbc  682b , which has a similar spectral type and value of @xmath15 .",
    "hbc  684 s emission lines also display similar line ratios as the corresponding absorption lines in a template spectrum or in hbc  682b .",
    "some of the unusual features in the hbc  684 spectra may be the result of fluorescence , but we are skeptical that this is the explanation for the entire set of emission lines observed .",
    "this paper presents the results of multi - epoch observations of a sample of nine young , late - type stars in the aquila star - forming region .",
    "sample objects were selected from @xcite based on their proximity to as  353a and classification as a wtts or ctts . the high - resolution ( r@xmath030,000 )",
    "@xmath1-and @xmath2-band observations were made between 2002 july and 2004 november with nirspec on keck  ii .",
    "the initial goal of this project was to examine one @xmath1-band order of the multiple - epoch spectra for radial velocity variations in order to detect spectroscopic binaries .",
    "one radial velocity variable object was discovered and absolute radial velocities were measured for the remaining eight objects .",
    "circumstellar properties of the stars were also examined via high - resolution @xmath2-band spectra and _ 2mass _ photometry .",
    "eight of the nine sample objects appear to be members of the same association because of similar radial velocities .",
    "the spatial extent of the known members , using our adopted distance of 200@xmath630  pc , is 32@xmath65  pc by 58@xmath69  pc .",
    "the ages of the observed objects exhibit a large scatter , with the youngest , most active members all of age @xmath01@xmath42  myr .",
    "two systems appear to have ages between 6 and 12 myr , and the oldest of these ( fg  aql / g3 ) has not been confirmed to show signatures of youth .",
    "therefore , the aquila association of stars is apparently one of the youngest nearby star - forming regions .",
    "the visual extinction to the association is estimated to be about 1@xmath42 magnitudes .",
    "the circumstellar environments of associations members are varied , ranging from extremely active ( as  353a , whose winds drive hh 32 ) to nearly devoid of circumstellar material ( as  353b , hbc  682 , and fg  aql / g3 , which all lack ir excess and strong h@xmath7 emission ) , with several typical ctts in between ( hbc  294 , hbc  681 , and hbc  683 ) .",
    "the source of the atomic and molecular emission lines in the spectra of hbc  684 is as yet unknown , but may be caused by an inversion layer , increased accretion , fluorescence , or a transient impact .",
    "for the seven systems in this study , hbc  681 , hbc  682 , hbc  683 , hbc  684 , hbc  294 , fg  aql / g3 , and as  353 , there is a high total number of stars , thirteen at least , yielding @xmath02 stars per system .",
    "this multiplicity is significantly higher than even that of the taurus region ( @xmath01.6 stars per system ; @xcite ) , although it applies to only a small sample and may be significantly impacted by observational biases .",
    "the extremely interesting stars identified to date in this association certainly warrant further investigation .",
    "much work remains to characterize this unusual star - forming region .",
    "the most pressing task is to confirm the existence of a larger association by searching for other young stars in the region and identifying radial velocities and proper motions of the new members .",
    "obtaining a more accurate distance determination to the association will also be critical to unraveling the age - distance discrepancy .",
    "for the non - thermal radio source as  353b , this could be accomplished with vlbi ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "once more complete membership is determined , the aquila star - forming region can be characterized in terms of mass function , multiplicity fraction , and other parameters .",
    "further observations in the millimeter , sub - millimeter , infrared , radio , and x - ray will also provide valuable information about the circumstellar environments of these objects , which will improve our understanding of key phases of pre - main - sequence stellar evolution .",
