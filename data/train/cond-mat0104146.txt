    "<S> if the sample is @xmath162-doped , for example , and the edges form the interfaces with a @xmath163-doped material , the spin polarization of the light emitted at the edges would be opposite in the quasiequilibrium regime , demonstrating the sg - separation . </S>",

    "<S> magnetic field could follow the evolution from ballistic regime to full equilibrium of a semiconductor spin system , yielding information not only about spin , but also about charge transport , as seen from our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the optical technique and the johnson - silsbee method , one could also in principle observe our predicted effect using the magnetic resonance force microscopy .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> we have studied transient spin dynamics of itinerant electrons in metals and degenerate semiconductors placed in an inhomogeneous magnetic field . in particular , we have solved exactly a spin dynamics model based on the boltzmann equation , and demonstrated that the spin evolution proceeds through four distinct modes : ballistic , diffusive , quasiequilibrium , and equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> an effective spin separation is possible in the quasiequilibrium regime , where the spin current vanishes and the spin is in equilibrium only with the inhomogeneous component of the magnetic field .    </S>",
