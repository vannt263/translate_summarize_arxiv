    "solar flares have been extensively observed in h@xmath0 line , since they show spectacular phenomena in this wavelength , such as filament / prominence eruptions , flare ribbons , post flare loops ( or coronal rains ) , and so on ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "h@xmath0 kernels , very bright and compact h@xmath0 emission sources seen in flare ribbons , are also one of the prominent features that appear during a flare .",
    "such flare ribbons and kernels have been thought to be caused by the energy deposition from the corona into the chromosphere .    to explain these various phenomena",
    "successfully , magnetic reconnection models have been widely discussed for last several decades .",
    "especially , the so - called cshkp magnetic reconnection model @xcite is often accepted as the `` standard '' model . in the scenario ,",
    "the connectivity of magnetic field lines is topologically changed ( i.e. re - connected ) in the corona , and then , vast magnetic energy stored in the corona is released .",
    "the released energy is converted to various kinds of energy ; kinetic energy spent for ejections of plasma , thermal energy to generate hot plasma of about 10  mk or more , nonthermal energy to accelerate energetic particles , and so on .",
    "the thermal conduction and/or the nonthermal particles rapidly travel along newly connected magnetic field lines .",
    "then , they reach the chromosphere , followed by the bombardment to the chromospheric plasma . h@xmath0 flare ribbons and kernels are caused by such bombardment .",
    "the cshkp model further suggests that magnetic field lines successively reconnect in the corona . during the successive magnetic reconnection , the reconnection points ( x - points ) move upward . as a result ,",
    "newly reconnected field lines have their footpoints farther out from the neutral line than the footpoints of the field lines that have already reconnected .",
    "therefore , the separation of the flare ribbons is not a real motion , but an apparent one ( see also the reviews of the cshkp model by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the energy deposition into the chromosphere also causes strong distortions of h@xmath0 line ( line width and line shift ) besides the emission .",
    "the enhancements of the intensity at red wings are particular , and have been reported as `` red asymmetry '' of the lines @xcite , while `` blue asymmetry '' is also reported to be sometimes seen at very early phase of a flare . comparing between the red and the blue wing images , it has known that such red asymmetry is seen overall the flare ribbons @xcite . @xcite examined the h@xmath0 impact polarization ( liner polarization ) due to collisions of high - energy particles at flare kernels , and reported that red asymmetry also appears at such kernels during the rise phase of kernel brightenings .",
    "observations on the red asymmetry with filtergraphs , however , have not been progressed so much since then , and the further characteristics on the spatial distribution of the red asymmetry remains to be revealed .",
    "@xcite reported that the red - shift corresponds to the downward motion with speed of several tens of km  s@xmath3 , based on their excellent spectroscopic observations .",
    "@xcite further reported that strong red asymmetry , which corresponds to the downward velocity of the order of tens of km  s@xmath3 , is observed at the outer edge of the flare ribbons .",
    "the width of the edges is about 2  3@xmath4 ( @xmath5 1500  2000 km ) .",
    "this is reasonable in the context of magnetic reconnection theories suggesting that strong energy depositions occur at the outer edges of the flare ribbons connected by the newly reconnected loops . @xcite",
    "also quantitatively examined the red asymmetry .",
    "the strong enhancement of the chromospheric plasma due to the precipitation of nonthermal plasma and/or thermal conduction causes not only red asymmetry of the chromospheric lines but explosive upflow of the heated plasma along the flare loops .",
    "the latter is called `` chromospheric evaporation '' , and has been observed as blue - shift of coronal emission lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a momentum balance between the downward motion of the chromospheric condensation and the chromospheric evaporation , and confirmed that the red asymmetry is a counteraction of the chromospheric evaporation .",
    "red asymmetry , in this way , tells us the quantitative information of the precipitation ( nonthermal particles / thermal conduction ) .",
    "understanding the features of the chromospheric plasma at the footpoints of flare loops is strongly related with understanding energy release / deposit mechanisms and is crucially important for solar flare studies .",
    "it has been , however , a challenge theoretically and numerically to explain exactly those observational facts ( e.g. @xcite ) , since the distortion of chromospheric lines is too complicated .",
    "observations on the red asymmetry , have not been progressed so much since @xcite .",
    "especially , spatial distribution of the red asymmetry using narrowband filtergram , remains to be revealed , although @xcite reported that red asymmetry features appear all over flare ribbons and continue from onset until late in the decay phase by using narrowband filtergram of h@xmath0 line . in this paper",
    "we examined the spatial distribution of the red asymmetry at h@xmath0 kernels and the temporal evolution , by using h@xmath0 wing images . in ",
    "2 we summarize the observational data and the features of the flare . in ",
    "3 we show the features of the red asymmetry . in ",
    "4 a summary and discussions are given .",
    "we observed a typical two - ribbon flare ( x2.3 on the goes scale ) that occurred in the noaa active region 9415 ( s22@xmath6 , w01@xmath6 ) at 05:10 ut , 2001 april 10 with the 60  cm domeless solar telescope ( dst ) at hida observatory , kyoto university .",
    "the h@xmath0 monochromatic images were obtained with the zeiss lyot filter of the 0.25   passband and kodak 4.2_i _ megaplus ccd camera with the size of 2024 @xmath7 2040 pixels sequentially in eight wavelengths : h@xmath0 @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15   . the successive wavelength change and recording",
    "were controlled with a personal computer , and the time cadence for each wavelength was about 30  s. the pixel size of the data is @xmath16 ( the highest resolution of the system is @xmath17 , but binning was done in the current case ) .",
    "however , the spatial resolution is about @xmath18 or worse according to the seeing .    in figure  1 we present snap shots of the h@xmath0 images in the ( a ) @xmath8 , ( b ) @xmath9 , ( c ) @xmath10 , ( d ) @xmath19 ( line center ) , ( e ) @xmath14 , ( f ) @xmath13 , ( g ) @xmath12 , and ( h ) @xmath15  wings , respectively .",
    "during the observation , the emissions at h@xmath0 kernels were so strong that some fine structures inside the flare ribbons were missed suffering from the saturation in the core . in this study , therefore , we mainly used the h@xmath0 @xmath8 and @xmath14   images only , in which the flare kernels are clearly seen rarely suffering from the saturation . in figure",
    "2 we show the temporal development of the flare in the h@xmath0 center ( _ top _ ) , in the @xmath13  wing ( _ middle _ ) , and in the @xmath9  wing ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the filament eruption is clearly seen in the blue wing images before the two ribbon flare starts .",
    "as the flare progresses the two ribbon structure evolves and separates to each other . in the later phase , downflows along the post flare loops ( coronal rains )",
    "are also seen in red wing images .",
    "as figure  1 shows and @xcite reported , the two flare ribbons lie roughly in the north - south direction , and the east ( left ) ribbon is of positive magnetic polarity , and the west ( right ) one is of negative polarity .",
    "as the flare progresses , the flare ribbons separate to each other , in the horizontal ( that is , in the east - west ) direction .",
    "we already reported the characteristics of the flare in h@xmath0 , which was observed with the _ sartorius _ telescope at kwasan observatory , kyoto university , in some previous papers @xcite .",
    "we also quantitatively discussed the relation between the flare ribbon evolution and the energy release rate in these papers .",
    "@xcite also studied the ribbon separation of this flare . in this event the oscillation of an h@xmath0 filament driven by an eit wave is also detected in a distant location @xcite .",
    "( 90mm,180mm)f1.eps    ( 162.5mm,120mm)f2.eps      before examining the characteristics of the red asymmetry , we checked the central position of the wavelength scan by the lyot filter with respect to the averaged h@xmath0 line center of the target region .",
    "since not only the tuning offset of the filter but also the solar rotation and the motion of the earth can cause a relative offset of the wavelength , we should know how much the line center is shifted during the observation .",
    "we used the averaged intensity of a quiet region near the flare site shown with the box in figure  1 ( a ) , and confirmed that the center of the lyot filter was @xmath20   displaced from the actual center of the h@xmath0 absorption .",
    "although such small offset may produces a fictitious shift of the spectral line , it can hardly produce a significant asymmetry of intensity as observed in far wings ( such as at @xmath21   ) of the emission h@xmath0 line .    comparing figure  1 ( a ) with ( e )",
    ", we can clearly see that the flare ribbons are much brighter in the @xmath14   wing than in the @xmath8   wings , and we can conclude that the intensity asymmetry is mainly caused by the effect of the red asymmetry ( or red shift ) of the h@xmath0 line .",
    "thus , we neglect the small offset of the observing wavelength in the following discussions .",
    "as the pair of the snap shots of figure  1 ( a ) and ( e ) simply but clearly show , most portions of the flare ribbons are brighter in the red - wing ( that is , h@xmath0 @xmath14   ) than those in the blue - wing ( h@xmath0 @xmath8   ) .",
    "this means that red asymmetry appears all over the flare ribbons , not only at bright kernels made by the bombardment of nonthermal particles , but also at other fainter points that are likely generated by the thermal conduction .",
    "the right two panels of figure  3 show the temporal evolution of the h@xmath0 intensities in the red ( @xmath14   : red line ) and blue ( @xmath8   : blue line ) wings for the selected flare kernels marked in the left panel of figure  3 . at these flare kernels ,",
    "the intensity in the red wing @xmath23 is always brighter than that in the blue wing @xmath24 during the burst .",
    "as we showed in the previous papers @xcite , we found nonthermal emissions in hard x - rays and in microwaves observed with the hard x - ray telescope ( hxt ; @xcite ) on board _ yohkoh _ @xcite and with the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ; @xcite ) , respectively , at these flare kernels .",
    "we also plotted the light curves of the microwave ( 17  ghz ) and the hard x - ray ( the h band ; 53  93  kev ) emissions in figure  3 with the black and gray solid lines .",
    "there are several peaks and the positions of the emission sources move during the impulsive phase .",
    "the flare kernels @xmath25 and @xmath7 are associated with the nonthermal emission sources whose peak times are 05:19 and 05:22ut , respectively , as colored with vertical gray regions in the right panels of figure  3 .    here",
    ", we note that both @xmath23 and @xmath24 are subtracted with the averaged intensity of the pre - brightening phase .",
    "both the intensities are set to be about zero , which is shown with the horizontal dotted line in the right panels of figure  3 . in the current case ,",
    "the time gaps to take images at these two wavelengths are also corrected . the h@xmath0 red ( @xmath14   ) wing images were always taken about 12  s previous to the paired blue ( @xmath8   ) wing images . to make the time profiles of red asymmetry on the right panels of figure  3 , we linearly interpolated the blue wing data so that the times correspond the observing times of the red wing data",
    ". we also have to note that the intensities are calculated by averaging the region of 5@xmath75 pixels ( which is equal to @xmath26 ) around the points marked with the @xmath7 and @xmath25 signs .",
    "these time profiles contain the region where the data suffer from the saturation , and therefore , their peaks are possibly plateaued ( underestimated ) .",
    "we showed the points which contain such saturated data with the upward arrows in the right panels of figure  3 .",
    "( 150mm,75mm)f3.eps    from the intensity profiles , we also obtained the temporal evolution of the red asymmetry ( @xmath22 ) by calculating @xmath27 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are intensities at the red- ( @xmath14   ) and blue- ( @xmath8   ) wings .",
    "the temporal evolution of @xmath22 is over - plotted with the @xmath7 and @xmath25 signs in the right panels of figure  3 .",
    "the data points suffering from the saturation are shown with the thin sings in the plots .",
    "these temporal evolutions of @xmath22 imply that the peaks of the red asymmetry precede those of the intensity by about 30 sec  1 minute , while we can not determine the exact peak times due to the saturation .",
    "moreover , the time profiles of @xmath22 keep high values of about 0.3  0.4 for several minutes even after the peaks . by comparing the time profiles of @xmath22 with the microwave and hard x - ray emissions during the burst times",
    ", we found that the start times of the @xmath22 enhancements correspond with or even precede to those of the nonthermal emissions .",
    "we examined the spatial distribution of the red asymmetry @xmath22 , by using the h@xmath0 intensity in the red- and blue - wing images . both @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "are subtracted with the averaged intensity of the quiet region .",
    "the quiet region used for the analysis is the same as that used above , and is shown with the box in figure  1 ( a ) .",
    "we present some snap shots of the 2-dimensional @xmath22 maps to show in figure  4 .",
    "the red / blue color shows the region where red / blue asymmetry appears .",
    "we can again confirm that the red asymmetry appears all over the flare ribbons during the impulsive phase of the flare .",
    "the green - hatched regions suffer from the saturation , and therefore , we excluded them from the calculations of @xmath22 here .",
    "the temporal evolution of the @xmath22 map is also shown .",
    "( 140mm,140mm)f4.eps    here , we used only two wing data ( @xmath28 1.5 ) , and we did not follow the whole line profiles , which could be strongly distorted during the flare . the @xmath22 calculated in this paper , however , can be a representative measure of the velocity , at least , at some layer of the chromosphere .",
    "since the emission at @xmath28 1.5 is , more or less , optically thin and is less affected from the radiative transfer effect of the vertically stratified atmospheric condensation , it serves as a simple measure of the line of sight velocity . according to h@xmath0 profiles of flares ( e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "@xmath22 at around @xmath28 1.5 certainly represent the doppler shift in line wings .    for the image taken at 05:23  ut",
    ", we also show the strong @xmath22 position ( @xmath29 and 0.65 ; which corresponds to more than 75 and 85  % of the maximum value of @xmath22 ) on the flare ribbon with the magenta and light blue colors in the bottom right panel of figure  4 .",
    "it shows that the strong @xmath22 regions are preferentially located at the outer edge of the flare ribbons .",
    "the outer edges of flare ribbons are the footpoints of the `` newly reconnected '' flare loops , in the context of the magnetic reconnection model .",
    "therefore , our result means that strong @xmath22 is associated with the footpoints of such newly reconnected loops that probably provide strong energy .",
    "the concentration of strong @xmath22 regions on the outer edges of flare ribbons is consistent with the previous works ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the width of the strong @xmath22 regions are about @xmath1  @xmath2 ( 1000  2000  km ) .",
    "the length along the direction of the flare ribbons can be longer , and is about @xmath1 ",
    "@xmath30 ( 1000  10000  km ) .",
    "the largest ones are roughly consistent with the length of the hard x - ray emission sources along the flare ribbons ( @xmath31  @xmath32 ) that appeared during the impulsive phase of the flare @xcite .",
    "as we already mentioned , there is time differences between the h@xmath0 red wing data and the paired blue wing data .",
    "it took about 12  s to shift the filter from the h@xmath0 red ( @xmath14   ) wing to the blue ( @xmath8   ) wing ( the red ones always precede from the blue ones in the current case ) .",
    "the flare ribbons expand during the flare with the speed of about 10  80 km s@xmath3 , and even faster in the earlier phase ( see @xcite , for more detail ) .",
    "therefore , the positions of the outer edges of the flare ribbons slightly different . in the current case",
    ", the flare ribbons in the blue wing data are always located outside ( of about 100",
    " 1000  km ) of those seen in the red wing data , which could cause `` fake '' blue asymmetry .",
    "indeed , we can recognize the blue asymmetry in the earlier phase as seen in the top left panel of figure  4 . although @xcite reported that such blue asymmetry sometimes appear at the earlier phase of flares , in the current case , it may be because the separation speed of the flare ribbons is much faster in the earlier phase . as the other panels of figure  4 show ,",
    "on the other hand , the time difference is not important so much in the later phase .",
    "therefore , the ra maps in figure  4 were made , ignoring the time differences of the 12  s. the times shown in figure  4 are those for the red wing data .",
    "we examined the relationship between the red asymmetry and the intensity of the h@xmath0 kernels . before this , we defined the summation ( @xmath33 ) and the difference ( @xmath34 ) of the intensities at both wings as @xmath35 and @xmath36 . therefore , the red asymmetry @xmath22 is consistent with @xmath34 divided by @xmath33 .",
    "again , we note that @xmath23 and @xmath24 are subtracted with the averaged intensity of the quiet region indicated with the rectangle in figure  1(a ) .",
    "the left panel of figure  5 shows the scatter plot between the difference @xmath34 ( horizontal axis ) and the summed h@xmath0 intensity @xmath33 ( vertical axis ) at the kernels .",
    "the `` kernels '' mentioned here are defined as the regions where the intensity exceeds the average intensity at the quiet region , and therefore , @xmath33 exceeds 0 .",
    "we can clearly see the tendency that the stronger @xmath34 is associated with the brighter h@xmath0 kernel .",
    "the regions hatched with gray color are excluded from the discussion because of the saturation .",
    "the scatter plot shows that @xmath33 is linearly proportional to @xmath34 , that is , @xmath37 with a proportional constant @xmath38 and an intercept @xmath39 . by fitting the data ,",
    "we get the constant @xmath38 to be about 2.5 .",
    "we also confirmed that the intercept @xmath39 is small ( about 20 counts ) , and we will ignore @xmath39 in the following discussion .",
    "the dark gray line in the left panel of figure  5 is the result of the liner fitting to the data .",
    "we also compared @xmath22 with the h@xmath0 intensity @xmath33 as shown in the right panel of figure  5 .",
    "the horizontal axis is @xmath22 , while the vertical axis is the same as the left panel .",
    "the regions colored gray again show the regions where the kernels suffer from the saturation .",
    "the data points seems to scatter around a mean value of 0.37 without significant correlation with intensity . by using the constant @xmath38",
    ", we can derive the relation @xmath40 , and therefore , @xmath41 is expected .",
    "the mean value of the line shift at different intensity does not vary with the intensity .",
    "the averaged value of about 0.37 is calculated for the bright kernels highlighted with the black signs in the right panel of figure  5 ( that is , the data points colored with right gray are excluded for the calculation ) .",
    "we examined the spatially resolved red asymmetry distributions seen in the 2001 april 10 solar flare and their temporal evolution , by using the h@xmath0 wing images taken with dst at hida observatory .",
    "we found that red asymmetry appears all over the flare ribbons , both for bright kernels generated by the bombardment of nonthermal particles and for other fainter regions generated by the ( thermal ) conduction .",
    "we confirmed that the strong @xmath22 appears at the outer edge of the flare ribbons that are the footpoints of newly reconnected flare loops .",
    "the width of about 1.5 ",
    "3.0@xmath4 ( @xmath5 1000  2000  km ) .",
    "this supports that the strong energy release occurs on the magnetic loops that connect the outermost edges of the flare ribbons .",
    "we found a clear tendency that the larger difference between the h@xmath0 red and the blue wing intensities @xmath34 is associated with the brighter h@xmath0 kernels @xmath33 .",
    "it turns out to be that the red asymmetry ( @xmath42 ) does not depend on the intensity of the h@xmath0 kernels , and scatters around a mean value of about 0.37 .",
    "in figure  3 we showed that the temporal evolution of @xmath22 does not synchronize with that of the intensity , and the peak times of @xmath22 time profiles precedes those of the intensities .",
    "moreover , the enhancements of @xmath22 time profiles procede to those of the nonthermal emissions observed in hard x - rays and/or in microwaves .",
    "@xcite also mentioned that redshift in the h@xmath0 wings starts to appear before the enhancement of the hard x - ray emission , that is , strong energy release occurs . at flare kernels , not only nonthermal particles but thermal conduction precipitate from the energy release site in the corona into the chromosphere .",
    "the preceding enhancement of @xmath22 to the hard x - ray emission could be caused by such other mechanisms rather than by nonthermal particles .",
    "to make clear the temporal evolutions of @xmath22 and intensity , we overlaid the temporal trajectories of the h@xmath0 kernels , shown in figure  3 with the @xmath7 and @xmath25 sings , on the scatter plot between @xmath22 and the summed intensity @xmath33 , which is presented as figure  6 .",
    "the @xmath22 plots move counter - clockwise on the scatter plot , and after the @xmath22 enhancements , the intensities reaches the peak .",
    "the absence of a clear correlation with the intensity is because the time profile of @xmath22 for individual kernels evolves independently with a manner that the peak downward velocity is not a strong function of their peak intensity .",
    "@xcite also reported that there is no one - to - one relation between brightness of h@xmath0 line center and redshift , while they found many redshift features at bright kernels at h@xmath0 line center .",
    "if we assume a constant width of the h@xmath0 emission line , we can regard @xmath22 as an indicator of the velocity .",
    "for example , assuming a gaussian function with the full - width - half - maximum @xmath43 in  , @xmath22 can be related to the doppler ( redward ) velocity as @xmath44  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the estimation of the width of the h@xmath0 emission line is , however , very difficult , because the shape of the line is drastically changed ( it can not be fitted with a gaussian function ) and especially the stark effect broadens the line at the wings @xcite . from the results of @xcite ( in the figs . 3b and 4b ) , we estimated @xmath22 for their flares , and they are about 0.2  0.5 , which is comparable to the 2001 april 10 flare .",
    "they also reported that the doppler velocities are 10  100  km  s@xmath3 , the fwhm of about 4.5  6.0 is expected .",
    "if we assume that the fwhm is about 5.0 , here , @xmath22 of 0.37 turns out the doppler ( downward ) velocity of about 53  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "scattering of @xmath22 around a certain value of about 0.37 is also because the time profiles of @xmath22 keep high values for several minutes even after the intensity peaks .",
    "this means that the downward motion at flare ribbons continues with the velocity of about several tens of km  s@xmath3 independently from the intensity .",
    "we first acknowledge an anonymous referee for her / his useful comments and criticisms .",
    "this work was supported by the grant - in - aid for the global coe program `` the next generation of physics , spun from universality and emergence '' from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) of japan ."
