    "a nucleon immersed in an external electromagnetic field acquires the electric and magnetic dipole moments which size is given , respectively , by the electric and magnetic _ polarizabilities _ @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "these static quantities , together with quantities such as the anomalous magnetic moment and charge radius , reflect the complexity of the nucleon structure .",
    "their empirical determination is very important for at least two reasons : first is that we would like to test our understanding of the nucleon structure based on microscopic calculations of these quantities , and second is that it enables us to evaluate the polarizability effects in phenomena such as hydrogen lamb shift , properties of nuclear matter , etc . here",
    "i shall illustrate these two motivations by looking at the description of proton polarizabilities in chiral perturbation theory ( sect .",
    "2 ) , and at their relevance to the muonic - hydrogen lamb shift measurement ( sect .  3 ) .",
    "i shall conclude with some words on prospects for better measurements of proton polarizabilities and of their momentum - transner dependencies .",
    "in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite , the nucleon polarizabilities should largely come as a prediction since the leading chiral - loop contribution is of order @xmath2 , while the unknown low - energy constants ( lecs ) come only at order @xmath3 . recall that @xmath4 is of order @xmath5 and hence @xmath3 contribution",
    "is expected to be no greater than 15 percent of @xmath2 .",
    "the result , however , depends on how or whether one includes the relativistic effects as well as the effects due to the @xmath6-isobar excitation .",
    "the leading relativistic corrections carries an extra factor of @xmath7 and hence _ nominally _ is of order @xmath3 . the scheme which consistently shuffles the relativistic corrections to the order where they nominally should appear is called heavy - baryon chpt ( hbchpt ) @xcite , in contradistinction with baryon chpt ( bchpt ) which simply follows from the manifestly lorentz - invariant lagrangian of chpt with baryons fields  @xcite . the leading @xmath6 contribution to polarizabilities",
    "is of order @xmath8 , where @xmath9 mev is the delta - nucleon mass difference and hence , depending on counting , had been considered to be of order @xmath2 ( @xmath10-expansion @xcite ) or @xmath3 (  resonance saturation \" ) , or in between ( @xmath11-expansion @xcite ) . by now , all the relevant contributions have been calculated in both hbchpt and bchpt and their numerical values are given as follows ( in units of @xmath12 @xmath13 ) : & & 0(p^3 ) _",
    "e1 = 6.8,_m1 = -1.8 ; o ( p^3 ) _ e1 = 12.2,_m1 = 1.2 .",
    "+ & & o ( ) _ e1 = 4.0 , _ m1 = 5.8;o ( ) _ e1 = 8.6 , _ m1 = 13.5 ; + & & : _ e1 = 10.8 , _ m1 = 4.0 ; _ e1 = 20.8 , _ m1 = 14.7 with a relatively small uncertainty due to higher - order ( @xmath3 ) contribution .",
    "modern evaluations of the baldin sum rule @xcite yield for the sum of polarizabilities a value of 13.8(5 ) which compares well with either the total @xmath14 bchpt value or with @xmath15 hbchpt value .",
    "this shows that in hbchpt the @xmath16 contributions should only be treated together with @xmath17 .",
    "if the deference between the bchpt and hbchpt numbers comes indeed from recoil corrections , then they are too significant to be neglected , and hence @xmath17 is to be mandatorily included in hbchpt . in case of proton compton scattering , where these polarizabilities prominently appear , the calculations show that upon inclusion of @xmath17 contributions the hbchpt achieves roughly the same results as @xmath14 bchpt @xcite , albeit with a loss of some predictive power due to the appearance of two new lecs .",
    "the present status of the bchpt , hbchpt , as well as  more empirical \" extractions of proton polarizabilities , as summarised in @xcite , is shown in .",
    "@xcite ( broader band ) and @xcite .",
    "chpt calculations are from @xcite ( bchpt  red blob ) and the ` unconstrained fit ' of @xcite ( hbchpt  blue ellipse ) . ]",
    "note the significant discrepancy of the bchpt prediction with the current particle data group values , which thes far has been attributed to a sizeable underestimate of uncertainty in the taps and subsequently pdg values .",
    "the electric polarizability of the proton is responsible for a zero - range force in atoms , which lead to a shift in the @xmath18-levels : e_ns^ ( ) = -4 _ em _",
    "n^2(0 ) _ 0^d q _ e1 ( q^2 ) , where @xmath19 is the fine - structure constant , @xmath20 is the square of the hydrogen wave - function at the origin , @xmath21 is the lepton mass and @xmath22 is the reduced mass : @xmath23 .",
    "the effect of magnetic polarizability is suppressed .    the effect in is of order @xmath24 ;",
    "there is one @xmath19 implicit in the polarizability .",
    "it is therefore of the same order as the effects of 3rd zemach radius and can make an impact on `` charge radius puzzle ''",
    "@xcite , i.e. , the 7@xmath25 discrepancy between the proton charge radius extraction based on either the electronic ( @xmath26h ) or muonic ( @xmath27h ) hydrogen lamb shift .",
    "the factor in the square brackets of acts a soft cutoff at the scale of order of the lepton mass @xmath21 , and hence the proton polarizability contribution in @xmath27h is expected to be bigger than in @xmath26h .",
    "how much bigger ?",
    "the transfer - momentum dependence of @xmath0 is inferred from the forward doubly - virtual compton scattering , and hence is not accessible in a direct experiment .",
    "only the sum , @xmath28 , is accessible through a generalized baldin sum rule .",
    "the baldin sum rule has been evaluated in several works leading to the so - called ` inelastic ' contribution to the shift @xmath27h 2s level  @xcite : e_2s^ ( ) = -4 _ em _ 2 ^ 2(0 ) _",
    "0^d q \\ { _ e1 ( q^2)+ _ m1 ( q^2 ) } - 13 .",
    "one then need subtract @xmath29 to obtain the energy shift as defined in , i.e. : @xmath30 , with e_2s^ ( ) = 4 _ em _ 2 ^ 2(0 ) _ 0^d q _ m1 ( q^2 ) .",
    "in other words the problem is shifted to finding @xmath29 which seems to be just as unknown as @xmath31 .",
    "this uncertainty of the polarizability contribution has been exploited by miller  @xcite to suggest that it could be as large as @xmath32 @xmath27ev needed to resolve the charge radius puzzle .",
    "an insight can be gained by using chpt , which should work well for momenta probed in atomic systems .",
    "based on general analytic properties of the momentum - transfer dependence ( i.e. , analyticity in the complex @xmath33 plane , except for the negative real axis  timelike region ) infer a dispersion relation of the type : \\ {    c_e1 ( q^2 ) + _ m1(q^2 )    } = _ 0^ \\ {    c_e1(-t ) + _ m1(-t )    } , where @xmath34 is an infinitesmal positive number . an explicit @xmath2 calculation in hbchpt yields : _",
    "m1^(3)(-t ) = ( t-4m_^2 ) , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 mev are respectively the axial and pion - decay constant ; @xmath37 is charged - pion mass . substituting this into we obtain _",
    "m1^(3)(q^2 ) = , which reproduces the result of birse and mcgovern  @xcite . substituting this into and setting for simplicity @xmath38",
    ", we obtain the following subtraction contribution : e_2s^ ( ) = ( - c + 2 ) 1.4 , where @xmath39 is the catalan number .",
    "we conclude that the outcome is tiny and is very unlikely to change by orders of magnitude upon refining the chpt calculation . a calculation in bchpt",
    "is nevertheless forthcoming @xcite .",
    "there is a still big room for improvement of our knowledge of nucleon polarizabilities , most notably in the empirical knowledge of their static values , as well as of their momentum - transfer dependence .",
    "even the static electric and magnetic polarizabilities of the proton are not pinned down to the accuracy of less than 10 percent .",
    "such accuracy seems well within the reach of current experimental capabilities and we shall definitely see a progress in this direction in a very near future .",
    "the beam asymmetry of compton scattering looks especially promising for a precise determination of the small magnetic polarizability  @xcite .",
    "a new round of real- and virtual - compton scattering experiments at low energies on the proton and light nuclei targets has recently commenced at mainz mictrotron ( mami ) at the university of mainz .",
    "there is real - compton scattering program running at the high intensity gamma source ( higs ) facility at duke university .",
    "the new high - intensity beam facilities , such as mesa , will bring new opportunities in this field .",
    "the work is partially supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) through collaborative research center sfb 1044  the low - energy frontier of the standard model \" .",
