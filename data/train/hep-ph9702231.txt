    ".3 cm    two puzzles exist associated to neutrinos : if massless , they would be only fermions with this property . if massive , why are their masses so much smaller than those of their charged brothers ?",
    "the fact that neutrinos are the only electrically neutral elementary fermions may hold the key to the answer , namely neutrinos could be majorana fermions , in some sense the most fundamental ones . in this case the supression of their mass could be associated to lepton number conservation .",
    "but so far we do not know .",
    "it is beyond any doubt that , one of the most fundamental drawbacks of the standard model is the fact that it says so little about the properties of neutrinos .",
    "their masslessness is not dictated by a fundamental underlying principle , such as gauge invariance in the case of the photon .",
    "most extensions of the standard model require neutrinos to be massive . one interesting aspect of many models where neutrinos have non - vanishing masses is that they lead to effects that could be experimentally tested , even outside the conventional realm of neutrino experiments , such as underground experiments . in some cases",
    "one may probe , though indirectly , the underlying physics at high energy accelerators .    from the observational point of view",
    "nonzero neutrino masses now seem required in order to account for the data on solar and atmospheric neutrinos , as well as the ( hot ) dark matter in the universe @xcite . but",
    "before overviewing the present observational limits and hints in favour of massive neutrinos , let us make a few general remarks about the theoretical models @xcite .",
    ".3 cm    one of the simplest extensions of the electroweak theory consists in adding isosinglet neutral heavy leptons ( nhls ) , such as right handed neutrinos , as in the seesaw model @xcite . in this case",
    "the nhls have a large majorana mass term @xmath7 , which violates total lepton number , or b - l ( baryon minus lepton number ) , a symmetry that plays an important role in many extended gauge models @xcite .",
    "the masses of the light neutrinos are obtained by diagonalizing the following mass matrix    c|cccccccc & & ^c + & 0 & d + ^c & d^t & m_r    [ ss ] where @xmath8 is the dirac mass matrix and @xmath9 is the isosinglet majorana mass . in the seesaw approximation , one finds = - d m_r^-1 d^t .",
    "[ seesaw ] this mechanism is able to explain naturally the relative smallness of masses @xcite .",
    "although the seesaw idea was suggested in the context of so(10 ) or left - right symmetric extensions where lepton number is a part of the gauge symmetry @xcite , it may be directly introduced in the standard model .",
    "though it is natural to expect @xmath7 to be large , one can not make any firm guess , as its magnitude heavily depends on the model . as a result one can not make any real prediction for the corresponding light neutrino masses that are generated through this so - called _ seesaw mechanism _ @xcite .",
    "although attractive , the seesaw mechanism is by no means the only way to generate neutrino masses .",
    "there is a large diversity of possible schemes to generate neutrino masses , which do not require any new large mass scale .",
    "for example , it is possible to start from an extension of the lepton sector of the 1 theory by adding a set of @xmath10 2-component isosinglet neutral fermions , denoted @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in this case",
    "there is an exact l symmetry that keeps neutrinos strictly massless , as in the standard model .",
    "the conservation of total lepton number leads to the following form for the neutral mass matrix    c|cccccccc & & ^c & s + & 0 & d & 0 + ^c & d^t & 0 & m + s & 0 & m^t & 0    [ mat ] this form has also been suggested in various theoretical models @xcite , including many of the superstring inspired models . in the latter case",
    "the zeros of naturally arise due to the absence of higgs fields to provide the usual majorana mass terms , needed in the seesaw model @xcite .",
    "the implications of are interesting on their own right , and the model represents a conceptually simple and phenomenologically rich extension of the standard model , which brings in the possibility that a wide range of new phenomena be sizeable .",
    "these have to do with neutrino mixing , universality , flavour and cp violation in the lepton sector @xcite , as well as direct effects associated with the nhl production in @xmath13 decays @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of this model is the possibility of non - trivial neutrino mixing despite the fact that neutrinos are strictly massless .",
    "this tree - level effect was exploited in ref .",
    "@xcite . moreover , there are loop - induced lepton flavour and cp non - conservation effects whose rates are precisely calculable @xcite .",
    "i repeat that this is remarkable due to the fact that physical light neutrinos are massless , as in the standard model .",
    "this feature is the same as what happens in the supersymmetric mechanism of flavour violation @xcite . indeed , in the simplest case of su(5 )",
    "supergravity unification , there are flavour violating processes , like @xmath14 , despite the fact that in su(5 ) neutrinos are protected by b - l and remain massless . the supersymmetric mechanism and that of differ in that the lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) processes are induced in one case by nhl loops , while in supersymmetry they are induced by scalar boson loops . in both cases",
    "the particles in the loops have masses at the weak scale , leading to potentially sizeable rates .",
    "the allowed lfv branching ratios in supersymmetry have been discussed here by barbieri @xcite . in the nhl model , as a result of the masslessness of the physical neutrinos , the allowed value for the lfv branching ratios is also maximized in the class of neutrino mixing models .",
    "indeed , one can show that some of the lfv rates can be sizeable enough to be experimentally detectable @xcite .",
    "clearly , one can easily introduce non - zero masses in this model through a @xmath15 term that could be proportional to the vev of a singlet field @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the seesaw scheme , the masses are directly proportional to @xmath17 , a fact which is very important for the phenomenology of the higgs boson sector .    there is also a large variety of possible _ radiative _ schemes to generate masses .",
    "the prototype models of this type are the zee model and the model suggested by babu @xcite . in these models",
    "lepton number is explicitly broken , but it is easy to realize them with spontaneous breaking of lepton number .",
    "for example in the version suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite the neutrino mass arises from the diagram shown in    -.5 cm [ 2loop ]    these models do not require one to introduce a large mass scale .",
    "it is quite possible to embed such schemes so as to have the spontaneous violation of the global lepton number symmetry . in these models",
    "again the masses are directly proportional to @xmath17 or some positive power of that , depending on the lepton numbers assignments of the model .",
    "thus the scale at which such a symmetry gets broken does not need to be high , as in the original proposal @xcite , but can be rather low , close to the weak scale @xcite .",
    "such models are very attractive and lead to a richer phenomenology , as the extra particles required have masses at scales that could be accessible to present experiments .",
    ".3 cm      .3 cm    the best limits on the neutrino masses can be summarized as @xcite : [ 1 ] m__e 5 ev , m _ _ 170 kev , m _ _ 23 mev these are the most model - independent of the laboratory limits on mass , as they follow purely from kinematics .",
    "the limits on the mass comes from beta decay , that on the mass comes from psi ( 90 % c.l . )",
    "@xcite , with further improvement limited by the uncertainty in the @xmath18 mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the best mass limit now comes from high energy lep experiment aleph @xcite and may be substantially improved at a future tau - charm factory @xcite . in connection with tritium beta decay limit",
    "@xcite it is interesting to remark two features in the spectrum .",
    "one is an excess of events near the end point of the differential spectrum , at @xmath19 ev , leading to a negative @xmath20 value in the fit and probably of instrumental origin .",
    "the second is an excess of events at lower electron energies @xmath21 ev , also observed by the mainz group .",
    "one possible explanation of this anomaly is the existence of a neutrino with mass @xmath22 ev and mixing with the with a probability @xmath23 % .",
    "it has been noted that this is precisely in the range implied by pulsar velocities @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are limits on neutrino masses that follow from the non - observation of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the most stringent bounds come from reactor oscillation experiments @xcite ( - @xmath24 oscillations ) ; from meson factory oscillation experiments ( karmen @xcite , lsnd @xcite ) and from accelerator experiments e531 ( - ) @xcite and e776 ( - ) @xcite . the 90 % confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "exclusion contours of neutrino oscillation parameters in the 2-flavour approximation are summarized in fig .",
    "[ oscil ] , taken from ref .",
    "improvements are expected from the ongoing chorus and nomad experiments at cern , with a similar proposal at fermilab @xcite .",
    "as we have heard at this conference , there are also good prospects for substantial progress at future long - baseline experiments using kek , cern and fermilab neutrino beams aimed at the kamiokande , gran sasso and soudan underground facilities , respectively . for recent theoretical studies on the possibility of performing cp violation studies in long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments",
    "@xcite .",
    "-0.5 cm [ oscil ]    if neutrinos are of majorana type a new form of nuclear double beta decay would take place in which no neutrinos are emitted in the final state , i.e. the process by which an @xmath25 nucleus decays to @xmath26 . in such process one would have a virtual exchange of majorana neutrinos .",
    "unlike the ordinary double beta decay process , the neutrino - less process violates lepton number and its existence would indicate the majorana nature of neutrinos .",
    "because of the phase space advantage , this process is a very sensitive tool to probe into the nature of neutrinos .",
    "present data place an important limit on a weighted average mass parameter @xmath27 @xcite [ bb ] 1 - 2  ev depending to some extent on the relevant nuclear matrix elements characterising this process @xcite .",
    "this bound comes from the heidelberg - moscow experiment and there might be further improvements , also from the igex experiment .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath27 involves both neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "thus , although rather stringent , this limit in may allow relatively large masses , as there may be strong cancellations between different neutrino types .",
    "this may happen automatically in the presence of suitable symmetries .",
    "for example , the decay vanishes if the intermediate neutrinos are dirac - type , as a result of the corresponding lepton number symmetry @xcite .",
    "neutrino - less double beta decay has a great conceptual importance .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in a gauge theory of the weak interactions a non - vanishing @xmath28 decay rate requires to be majorana particles , _ irrespective of which mechanism induces it_. this is important since in a gauge theory neutrino - less double beta decay may be induced in other ways .",
