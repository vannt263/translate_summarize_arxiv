    "we start in section [ methods ] by discretizing the efie , and derive expressions for the discrete fourier transform of the field scattered by a bounded dielectric object in the case of transverse electric polarization . using a key property of bessel functions of fixed argument ( demonstrated in appendix [ bessel ] ) , namely that their amplitude monotonically decays to zero as the order is increased beyond a threshold value , we present our main results on the bandlimited nature of the scattered fields in section [ results ] . in this section",

    "finally , the far field approximation for the scattered field can be written as ; @xmath48      we are now in a position to consider the @xmath23-point discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , @xmath49 , of the scattered electric field , @xmath24 , as obtained in eq .",

    "further , since the maximum possible value of @xmath52 is @xmath0 ( for a dielectric bounded within a cylindrical region of radius @xmath0 ) , it naturally follows that for @xmath66 the fourier component , @xmath67 will be negligible .",

    "it must be mentioned that this bandlimit corresponds to an _ effective _ bandwidth , as the fourier coefficients for @xmath70 are negligible , but not identically zero @xcite .",

    "the scattering object is confined within a cylinder of radius @xmath83 , the fields are computed on a radius of @xmath84 , the computational domain is terminated by applying a radiation boundary condition at a radius @xmath85 , and the te - polarized incident field makes an angle of @xmath86 with the @xmath87 axis . for the numerical convergence of the fem solution , the domain discretization must be on the order of @xmath88 , which results in a mesh having approximately 90,000 elements . in the first configuration ,",
    "the cylinder has a uniform permittivity , @xmath89 , while in the second configuration , we allow the permittivity of the cylinder to be random such that @xmath90 for each element is a uniform random variable from 1 to 10 .",
    "the scattered fields in both cases are shown in figure [ fig - fields ] , and their corresponding spatial dfts in figure [ fig - fft ] .",
    "we find that regardless of the constitutive permittivity of the scattering object , the dft is bandlimited , and that the band limit matches very well with the analytical prediction of @xmath91 from section [ bandlimit - analytical ] . here , @xmath92 , which gives @xmath93 ( see figure [ fig - fft ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the observation circle ( @xmath84 ) is not in the far - field of the scattering object ( @xmath92 ) , the predicted cut - off matches very well with the fem results ( which do not assume any far - field approximation ) .",
    "this is because the idea of an effective bandwidth as derived by bucci et al .",

    "the top - right inset shows all fourier coefficients , clearly demonstrating the symmetric and bandlimited nature of the fields for both cylinders .",
    "the main graph shows the first 50 fourier coefficients , and it is evident that beyond @xmath96 the fourier coefficients have negligible magnitude .",
    "the inset on the top - left shows the permittivity of the random cylinder as a function of space.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      so far , we have considered the dielectric object to be illuminated by a single electromagnetic wave , and found that the scattered field can be represented in terms of @xmath97 fourier components . in other words , in an inverse problem type setting , there will be @xmath98 linearly independent relations that can be used to relate the known value of the scattered field to the unknown permittivity of the object . in the language of the formalism presented in this paper ,",

    "( [ scatf-2 ] ) .",
    "a natural question that arises is : by what method can more information be gained about the object ?",
    "it is conceivable that by introducing multiple incidence angles , further constraints can be imposed on the unknown object permittivity .",
    "however , we show that the number of such constraints can not be increased linearly with the number of incidence angles , and that there is an upper limit on the number of useful angles .    to see this , we go back to the integral equation formulation as in eq .",
    "( [ intg_eqn ] ) and note that this equation , when discretized , leads to a well - determined system of equations @xcite , denoted by @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is a  forward \" matrix , @xmath103 consists of the internal field values for the @xmath104 incidence angle , and the incidence angle appears in the known vector , @xmath105 .",

    "( [ scat - ff ] ) w.r.t .",
    "the observation point index , @xmath47 in section [ dft - plane ] . extending the analogy",
    "further , it is seen that this band limit is given by the expression ; @xmath113 thus , only upto @xmath114 incidence angles are useful in imposing independent constraints on the unknown permittivity of the object . beyond this number",
    ", the field can be reconstructed using @xmath114 sampled values and a suitable interpolation scheme @xcite ; no new information can be gained .",
    "we note that this number depends only on the relative object size , and does not depend on the object permittivity .",
    "we also note that this result has previously been derived in the framework of functional analysis by bucci and isernia @xcite .",
    "the nyquist - shannon sampling theorem @xcite states that for a function that is bandlimited to a maximum frequency component , @xmath115 , the minimum sampling frequency required to reconstruct the function is given by @xmath116 . applying this theorem to the scattered electric field , which is known to be bandlimited , implies that for a fixed object size , @xmath0 , it is optimal to make @xmath117 equally spaced measurements of the scattered field . in an experimental setup it may be necessary to measure the fields scattered due to an object .",
    "it is common to have a dedicated antenna for each measurement ; we thus have a lower bound on the hardware complexity of the experiment .",
    "further , if it is desired to estimate the scattered field at more points than these , a suitable interpolation scheme can be applied to the sampled values of the field @xcite .",
    "a setup such as that described above  surrounding an object with several antennae  is fairly common in experiments which perform breast cancer detection using microwave imaging techniques @xcite .",
    "although our results apply to a two - dimensional geometry , the same approach can be easily applied to the three - dimensional problem .      in the inverse scattering problem ,",
    "the measurements of the scattered fields are typically noise corrupted .",
    "also , it has been shown that the scattered field is bandlimited to @xmath97 .",
    "thus , a robust strategy for determining the unknown permittivity of an object would be to : ( i ) take the dft of the measurements ( i.e.  obtain @xmath118 $ ] ) , ( ii ) apply a bandpass filter which zeroes out all @xmath67 components for @xmath119 , and ( iii ) use the remaining @xmath120 components of @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ dftscatf ] ) for the purpose of solving the inverse problem , i.e. determining the dielectric contrast , @xmath31 .",
    "more constraints on @xmath31 via eq .   can be imposed by increasing the number of incidence angles , but as shown earlier ( section [ multiple ] ) , the maximum number of useful incidence angles is limited to @xmath121 as well .",
    "thus , the property of bandlimitedness can be used to make the inverse problem noise - resilient to a certain degree .",

    ", the value of @xmath134 exceeds @xmath135 and grows .",
