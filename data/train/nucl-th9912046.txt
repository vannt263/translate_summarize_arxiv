    "a dense partonic system , often called the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is expected to be formed in heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , which will soon start to operate at the brookhaven national laboratory . of all experimental observables that are sensitive to the presence of the qgp ,",
    "charmonium is among the most promising ones . in particular , the dissociation of charmoniums in qgp due to color screening would lead to a reduction of their production in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the suppression of charmonium production in these collisions has thus been proposed as a possible signature for the formation of qgp @xcite .",
    "extensive experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted to study this phenomenon @xcite",
    ". however , available experimental data on @xmath0 suppression in colliding systems ranging from @xmath10 to s+u are consistent with the scenario that charmoniums are absorbed by target and projectile nucleons with a cross section of about @xmath5 mb @xcite . only in recent data from the pb+pb collision at @xmath11 gev@xmath12 in the na50 experiment at cern @xcite",
    "is there a large additional @xmath0 suppression in high @xmath13 events , which requires the introduction of other absorption mechanisms .",
    "while there are suggestions that this anomalous suppression may be due to the formation of qgp @xcite , other more conventional mechanisms based on @xmath0 absorption by comoving hadrons have also been proposed as a possible explanation @xcite . since the latter depends on the values of @xmath0 absorption cross sections by hadrons , which are not known empirically , it is important to have better knowledge of the interactions between charmonium states and hadrons in order to understand the nature of the observed anomalous charmonium suppression .",
    "knowledge of @xmath0 absorption cross sections by hadrons is also useful in estimating the contribution of @xmath0 production from charm mesons in the hadronic matter formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "since the charm meson to @xmath0 ratio in proton - proton collisions increases with energy , it has been shown that @xmath0 production from hadronic matter may not be negligible in heavy ion collisions at the large hadronic collider energies @xcite . to use @xmath0 suppression as a signature for the formation of qgp in these collisions",
    "thus requires the understanding of both @xmath0 absorption and production in hadronic matter .",
    "various approaches have been used in evaluating the charmonium absorption cross sections by hadrons . in one approach , the quark - exchange model has been used . an earlier study based on this model by martins , blaschke , and",

    "satz @xcite have studied the dissociation of charmonium bound states by energetic gluons inside hadrons .",
    "they have predicted that the dissociation cross section increases monotonously with @xmath16 and has a value of only about @xmath17 mb around @xmath18 gev . in the third approach ,",
    "meson - exchange models based on hadronic effective lagrangians have been used . using pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar - vector - meson couplings ( ppv couplings ) ,",
    "matinyan and mller @xcite have found @xmath19 mb at @xmath20 gev . in a more recent study ,",
    "haglin @xcite has included also the three - vector - meson couplings ( vvv couplings ) and four - point couplings ( or contact terms ) , and obtained much larger values of @xmath0 absorption cross sections .",
    "large discrepancies in the magnitude of @xmath3 ( as well as @xmath4 ) thus exist among the predictions from these three approaches , and further theoretical studies are needed . in the present study , we use a meson - exchange model as in ref . @xcite but treat differently the vvv and four - point couplings in the effective lagrangian and also take into account the effect of form factors at interaction vertices .",
