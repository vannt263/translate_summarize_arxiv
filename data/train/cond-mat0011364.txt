    "there are two important challenges in phase coherent transport phenomena .",
    "one is to fabricate quantum bits for quantum computing  @xcite . the other is to make an einstein , podolsky , rosen ( epr ) experiment",
    ", that would be able to probe bell inequalities with electrons  @xcite .",
    "bell inequalities have already been tested experimentally with photons  @xcite , being massless particles .",
    "epr experiments constitute one of the ultimate tests of quantum mechanics , which is a non local theory without hidden variables ( at least with photons ) . at the present stage",
    ", there exists no clear proposal of what should be an epr experiment with electrons .",
    "it is not even known whether it is possible to propose a realistic situation in which a transport experiment could detect the presence / absence of hidden variables with electrons .",
    "however , electrons carry an electric charge while photons do not",
    ". one can take advantage of this , and propose experiments with electrons that would not be possible with photons .",
    "it is already well established that the basic condition required to design an epr experiment with electrons is to have a source of correlated pairs of electrons  @xcite .",
    "several dc transport experiments have been proposed recently  @xcite , and a new proposal is made here . from a technical point of view , i concentrate on the simplest non perturbative formulation of transport theory , which relies on the use of effective single site green s functions . by non perturbative ,",
    "i mean that transport theory is exact to all orders in the tunnel amplitude . as a consequence",
    ", i can solve the physics of high transparency contacts .",
    "the interesting aspect of the formalism is that part of the circuit can be decimated exactly .",
    "only one physical parameter is renormalized ( the density of states ) .",
    "i show how to cure a more technical problem , related to the fact that all possible feynman diagrams are present in the theory and have exactly the same value .",
    "the solution is to act on the infinite series of feynman diagrams with an operator counting the charge of a given diagram .",
    "i apply the method to discuss four relevant physical questions :    * what is the thermodynamics of a superconductor in the presence of correlated pairs of electrons  ?",
    "i show that the strength of superconductivity depends on whether there exists or not non separable correlations in the vicinity of the superconductor .",
    "this may have direct implications for experiments .",
    "* it is possible to fabricate linear superpositions of correlated pairs of electrons .",
    "how should one interpret transport of such states  ?",
    "i show that transport theory is related to quantum measurement _ via _ projections of the linear superposition onto cooper pair objects .",
    "* is there any way to manipulate one electron making the correlated pair and look at the response of the other electron  ?",
    "i show that the answer is _ yes _ and propose a new type of aharonov - bohm effect that can be used to probe non separable correlations .",
    "generically , there is no way to manipulate one electron without avoiding a response of the other electron .",
    "* is there a specific physics associated to cooper pair penetration in ferromagnets in the presence of domain walls ?",
    "a simple model is solved , which shows that superconducting correlations can propagate along ferromagnetic domain walls .",
    "this may apply to recent experiments in ferromagnet   superconductor heterostructures  @xcite , and constitutes the proximity version of cryptomagnetism .    regarding the third question ,",
    "it is worth recalling that in ordinary mesoscopic physics aharonov - bohm experiments  @xcite , electrons are forced to travel through a metallic ring in the presence of a magnetic flux @xmath3 inside the hole of the ring .",
    "the current oscillates periodically as a function of @xmath3 , with a period equal to the flux quantum @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this is because the system behaves like an interferometer in which the phase of the electronic wave function is related to the circulation of the vector potential .",
    "these oscillations occur in a variety of situations .",
    "for instance , the dual situation in which a magnetic flux is forced to travel around a magnetic charge is known as the aharonov - casher effect  @xcite .",
    "it is also very often that excitations of correlated states of matter do not carry a charge @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , cooper pairs carry a charge @xmath6 .",
    "the associated flux quantum is @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "now when ferromagnetic or normal metal electrodes are connected to a superconductor , it is possible to fabricate correlated pairs of electrons of the type latexmath:[$c_{\\alpha,\\uparrow}^+ c_{\\beta,\\downarrow}^+    cooper pair reside in different electrodes .",
    "i propose here a situation in which the spin@xmath0 electron making the cooper pair is forced to couple to a vector potential ( by propagating on a loop in the presence of a magnetic flux ) while the spin(@xmath2 ) electron is not directly coupled to the magnetic flux ( it propagates in an ordinary ferromagnet without any hole ) .",
    "as i show , _ the spin(@xmath2 ) current oscillates as a function of the flux coupled to spin-@xmath0 electron_. this new type of aharonov - bohm effect can be viewed as a direct consequence of non separable correlations , and may be tested in future experiments .",
    "the article is organized as follows . as a warm up exercise ,",
    "i first calculate the transport formula associated to non local andreev reflections in section  [ sec:1 ] .",
    "i introduce the effective single site formalism in section  [ sec : forma ] , and provide a discussion of higher order feynman diagrams .",
    "transport of linear superpositions of correlated pairs of electrons is derived in section  [ sec : ent ] .",
    "the aharonov - bohm experiment is discussed in section  [ sec : ab ] .",
    "i present in section  [ sec : domain ] a simple model for superconducting propagation along a domain wall , which appears to be a problem closely related to non separable correlations .",
    "final remarks are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",

    "[ fig : single ] in which a superconductor is connected to @xmath9 ferromagnetic electrodes .",

    "the nambu representation of the effective single site ferromagnetic green s function reads @xmath14 / 2 + \\rho_{k,\\downarrow } [ { \\hat{i}}- \\hat{\\sigma}^z ] / 2 \\right\\}$ ] , with @xmath15 the spin@xmath0 density of states in the ferromagnetic electrode @xmath16 .",
    "the nambu representation of the hopping matrix element is @xmath17 . using effective single site green s functions",

    "[ eq : gap2 ] should be strictly speaking applied only if the dimension of the superconductor is small compared to the coherence length .",
    "* it is nevertheless possible to extrapolate to the physics occurring when a bulk superconductor is connected to ferromagnetic electrodes . in this case",
    "there is a non homogeneous gap in the superconductor , which is reduced at the interfaces with ferromagnetic electrodes .",

    "instead , i assume that the gap is a fixed quantity , but i could easily inject _ a posteriori _ the self consistent value of the gap in the transport equations .",
