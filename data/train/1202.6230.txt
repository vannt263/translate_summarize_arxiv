    "the theory of the frequency and amplitude of stochastic oscillations in models of epidemics of childhood diseases has been extensively developed over the last few years  @xcite , but the question of the synchrony of these oscillations has received comparatively little attention .",
    "this is despite its undoubted importance ; whether the oscillations in different locations are in phase or out of phase with each other will clearly have consequences for the duration of an epidemic and for the persistence of a disease .",
    "the particular case of in - phase and antiphase locking of epidemics in coupled cities has been described and interpreted in the literature  @xcite , but only for models that exhibit periodic oscillations in the infinite population limit .",
    "similarly , synchronisation in models of coupled oscillators has been extensively studied  @xcite , including in particular demographic oscillators  @xcite , but not in the context of epidemics .",
    "this subject has been so little investigated from a theoretical point of view , that it is useful to recall a simpler , and more familiar example .",
    "it is frequently argued in connection with predator - prey interactions that if predator numbers happen to be high , prey numbers will subsequently fall due to increased predation , and when prey numbers fall , predator numbers will subsequently fall due to lack of food .",
    "this is actually an argument which relates to fluctuations in the number of predators and prey and would seem to indicate oscillations , with predator and prey numbers being out of phase with each other .    a similar argument , although not so well - known , can be applied to infected and susceptible individuals in a city . in both cases ,",
    "the frequency and amplitude of these oscillations is very well captured by the van kampen system - size expansion  @xcite , and it seems reasonable to suppose that the same approach should also be able to quantify the synchrony and phase - lag between oscillations of different kinds of individuals . in this paper",
    "we apply this method to study possible synchronisation between fluctuations in the number of infected individuals in a network of cities between which individuals commute .",
    "a previous study  @xcite has shown that if the parameter setting the infection rate , denoted by @xmath0 , is the same for all cities in the network , then the stochastic dynamics takes a remarkably simple form .",
    "this has been known for some time in the case of the deterministic dynamics : a rather general theorem tells us that in this case the fraction of susceptible , infected and recovered individuals is the same in all cities  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the stochastic oscillations in this situation are also quite simple , having only one frequency , which is independent of the city , even if the sizes of the cities are different .",
    "as we will show later , these oscillations are synchronised between cities , but with no phase lag , in agreement with the findings reported in the literature for stochastic simulations of infection dynamics on coupled population patches  @xcite .",
    "exploring spatial heterogeneity as a means to overcome some of the shortcomings of the standard description of epidemics , namely in the predicted frequency of disease fade - outs , was one of the goals of these studies . in this sense ,",
    "the trivial phase relation between cities is a negative result .",
    "however , it was assumed in previous work that the infection rate @xmath0 is the same in all cities . if @xmath0 is taken to be different in different cities , the symmetry of the fixed point is broken , which introduces the possibility of more complex oscillations .",
    "there are other ways of achieving this , but within the framework in which we will work , this is a natural way of introducing the symmetry breaking .",
    "we shall see that , under these conditions , the numbers of infected individuals fluctuate with a phase lag between cities , provided that the coupling is not too strong .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we describe the stochastic model , including a microscopic interpretation of the parameters in terms of the mobility patterns of the populations and the characteristics of the disease .",
    "the deterministic equations in the infinite population limit are derived in sec .",
    "[ dyn ] , as are the langevin equations for the fluctuations around the non - trivial deterministic equilibrium in the linear noise approximation , found using van kampen s system - size expansion . in sec .",
    "[ analyse ] we introduce the complex coherence function that measures the cross - correlations between different cities and/or types of individuals , and we compute it for susceptibility and infection in the simple case of one city as an illustration of the method .",
    "the correlation between infection in two cities is studied in sec .",
    "[ 2cities ] and it is shown that for moderate coupling and different @xmath0 the fluctuations have a characteristic frequency range and phase relation .",
    "this is extended to the case of three cities in sec .",
    "[ 3cities ] .",
    "we conclude in sec .  [ final ] .",
    "the model consists of @xmath1 cities , labeled @xmath2 containing individuals who are infected , susceptible or recovered from a disease . as is common , for mathematical convenience the total number of individuals in a particular city , @xmath3 for city @xmath4 ,",
    "this means that the number of recovered individuals in each city may be expressed in terms of the number of infected and the number of susceptible individuals : @xmath5 , @xmath2 .",
    "this reduces the number of degrees of freedom from three to two per city , considerably simplifying the analysis .",
    "it also means that deaths and births are coupled , with the random death of an individual giving rise to the birth of a susceptible individual , and so providing a fresh victim for the disease .",
    "we will have in mind a particular type of interchange of individuals between cities , but we will see that the construction which comes from this is sufficiently general to encompass a large variety of situations .",
    "a concrete example of what we have in mind is a set of residential areas and one or more urban areas ; there would typically be a significant fraction of commuters from the former to the latter , and fewer from the latter to the former .",
    "the model will thus allow for a fraction of the individuals from city @xmath4 to commute to city @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 , with the number of non - commuters ( residents ) in city @xmath4 being @xmath8 .",
    "the model will differ from that studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in that we will take into account the different nature of the city ( for instance , residential or urban ) by allowing the parameter describing the rate of infection , @xmath0 , to vary from city to city .",
    "if we denote the state of the system of @xmath1 cities at a given time by @xmath9 , then the recovery of an individual in city @xmath4 will occur at a rate @xmath10 and cause a transition to the new state @xmath11 .",
    "we will write the transition rate for this case as @xmath12 with the initial state on the right and the final state on the left .",
    "it should be noted that we have only listed only the variables in city @xmath4 in order to lighten the notation . in a similar fashion ,",
    "the death of an infected or recovered individual , and the birth of a susceptible , in city @xmath4 are given by @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the network structure manifests itself when constructing the transition rates induced by infections .",
    "the rate of infections involving susceptibles from city @xmath4 and infectives from city @xmath6 will be proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "there will be five types of term . in two of them",
    "these are when the infective residents in city @xmath4 infect susceptible residents in city @xmath4 and when infective commuters from city @xmath4 infect susceptible commuters from city @xmath4 in city @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the rates for these are respectively @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the parameter which characterises the infection rate in city @xmath4 and where @xmath21 is the number of individuals in city @xmath4 : @xmath22    the other three terms result when the susceptibles from city @xmath4 are infected by individuals from city @xmath6 where cities @xmath4 and @xmath6 are different .",
    "then , infective commuters can infect resident susceptibles at a rate @xmath23 , infective residents can infect commuting susceptibles at a rate @xmath24 and finally infective commuters from city @xmath6 infect susceptible commuters from city @xmath4 in city @xmath16 ( @xmath25 ) at a rate @xmath26 .",
    "these results allow us to write down the transition rate for infection as @xmath27 where @xmath28    although we have a particular picture of how individuals move between cites , and of the assignment of infection rates to the cities themselves , the final form of the transition rate ( [ infection ] ) is quite general .",
    "our results will therefore apply to a wide range of the possible types of interchanges of individuals and choice of infection parameters .",
    "unlike the case where the @xmath20 were all equal  @xcite , the @xmath29 have no relations between them , and so in general are independent",
    ". therefore they can be chosen from a consideration of eq .",
    "( [ beta_jk ] ) or simply externally imposed .",
    "the model defined in section  [ model ] is stochastic and markovian , since the transition rates ( [ recovery ] ) , ( [ death_birth ] ) and ( [ infection ] ) do not depend on past states of the system .",
    "this means that adopting a continuous time description , the time evolution of the system may be obtained from a master equation for @xmath30 , the probability distribution for finding the system in state @xmath31 at time @xmath32  @xcite @xmath33 , \\label{master}\\ ] ] where the @xmath34 are each of the rates ( [ recovery ] ) , ( [ death_birth ] ) and ( [ infection ] ) taken in turn  @xcite .",
    "the full master equation ( [ master ] ) can not be solved exactly , but the aspects that concern us here can be analysed in a remarkably precise way using the system - size expansion of van kampen  @xcite .",
    "we have carried out this calculation on a simpler version of this model  when all the @xmath20 were equal  elsewhere  @xcite , and while the predictions are different , the method of carrying out the expansion is very similar .",
    "a comparison of the transition rates shows that the results for the model we are investigating here may be obtained from those in ref .",
    "@xcite by substituting @xmath35 by @xmath29 .",
    "we will therefore only briefly indicate the steps in the analysis , and refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "the method begins by making the following ansatz @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are the fraction of individuals from city @xmath4 which are respectively susceptible and infected in the deterministic limit",
    ". therefore the variables are broken down into a sum of deterministic terms , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and the stochastic deviations from these , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the deterministic terms satisfy the ordinary differential equations @xmath43 where @xmath2 .    the stochastic fluctuations , @xmath41 and @xmath44 , which describe the linear fluctuations around trajectories of the deterministic set of equations ( [ deter ] ) , are found to obey a set of linear stochastic differential equations .",
    "for convenience we introduce the vector of these fluctuations @xmath45 and indices @xmath46 , then these stochastic differential equations have the form  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 are gaussian noise terms with zero mean which satisfy @xmath49 . the two @xmath50 matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52 are obtained from the expansion procedure .",
    "in fact , to determine the matrix @xmath51 it is not necessary to carry out the full system - size expansion , since it is related to the jacobian , @xmath53 , found from linear stability analysis about a fixed point of eq .",
    "( [ deter ] ) .",
    "the precise relationship is @xmath54 , where @xmath55  @xcite .",

    "otherwise the @xmath1 cities may be split into non - interacting subsets , and several equilibria may be found by combining disease extinction in some subsets with non - trivial equilibrium in other subsets .",
    "the disease extinction fixed point is simple to find .",

    "6 we have considered different population sizes and coupling parameters @xmath174 and we have also increased the difference between the transmission rates @xmath175 , @xmath176 with respect to the previous example . the results for the fluctuation power spectra and for the ranges of @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 in the complex plane are plotted in fig .",
    "6 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . in this case",
    "we find three different phase lags for the correlated fluctuations in the three city pairs .",
    "these phase lag effects have implications for estimates of the duration of an epidemic and of the likelihood of disease extinction . in a metapopulation model with different transmission rates",
    "epidemic bursts should last longer , and disease extinction should occur less frequently than in a single population with the same overall size .",
    "in this paper we have considered a stochastic metapopulation version of a susceptible - infected - recovered model representing infection dynamics in different demographically coupled urban centers .",
    "we derived the state transition rates of the stochastic process from a microscopic model for the mobility of individuals between cities .",
    "similar rate equations based on a phenomenological coupling parameter have been proposed in the literature . here",
    "we have adopted a bottom - up approach , as an illustration of how the parameters of the general model can be related with the mobility patterns of the sub - populations .",
    "the correlations between the fluctuations in the number of infected in different cities were studied by means of the complex coherence function .",
    "it was found that , if the infection rate differed from city to city and the coupling was not too strong , oscillations were observed which were synchronised with a well defined phase lag between cities .",
    "we also showed that for realistic population sizes this effect was well described analytically by the linear noise approximation .",
    "the combined effect of stochasticity and demographic coupling as a possible driver of correlations and spatial patterns that are missed by traditional epidemic models was suggested long ago  @xcite .",
    "this idea has been left largely unexplored because these early studies based on computer simulations took the infection rate to be the same in different cities . in this case , as we have seen , the fluctuations are trivially synchronized , with no phase lag . however , the infection rate is a phenomenological parameter that depends not only on the disease but also on the rate of potentially infectious contacts that characterize a given social environment . in particular",
    ", a strong positive correlation between measles transmission rate and population density was confirmed in recent study based on daily monitoring of urban populations  @xcite .",
    "the conditions found in this paper for a non - trivial phase relation between the disease incidence fluctuations in connected urban centres can therefore be considered realistic in many settings .",
