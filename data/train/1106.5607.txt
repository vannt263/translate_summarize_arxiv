    "the motion of quarks inside the nucleons plays an important role in some effects which are at present intensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically",
    ". actual goal of this effort is to obtain a more consistent 3-d picture of the quark - gluon structure of nucleons .",
    "for example the quark  transversal momentum creates the asymmetries in particle production in polarized ( sidis ) or in unpolarized ( cahn effect ) experiments on deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "relevant tool for the study of these effects is the set of the transverse momentum dependent distributions ( tmds ) .",
    "apparently , a better understanding of the quark intrinsic motion is also a necessary condition to clarify the role of  quark orbital angular momenta in generating nucleon spin .",
    "we have paid attention to these topics in our recent studies , see @xcite and citations therein . in particular we have shown that the requirements of lorentz invariance ( li ) and the nucleon rotational symmetry in its rest frame ( rs ) , if applied in the framework of the 3-d covariant quark - parton model ( qpm ) , generate a set of relations between parton distribution functions .",
    "recently we obtained within this approach relations between usual parton distribution functions and the tmds . the wanzura - wilczek approximate relation ( ww ) and some other known relations between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 structure functions were similarly obtained in the same model before @xcite .",
    "let us remark that the ww relation has been obtained independently also in another approaches @xcite in which the li represents a basic input .",
    "the aim of the present report is to consistently apply the assumption li&rs to the kinematics of dis and to obtain the constraints on related kinematical variables .",
    "that is a complementary task to the study of above mentioned relations between distribution functions , which depend on these variables .",
    "so , the report can be considered as an addendum to our former papers related to the covariant qpm @xcite .",
    "since the present discussion is motivated and based on our earlier study of a covariant version of qpm , obtained results correspond only to the leading order of a more consistent qcd treatment . in this sense",
    "it would be interesting to compare our results with the leading order of a real qcd approach , like e.g. the recent study of perturbative qcd evolution of tmds @xcite .",
    "however such task would go beyond the scope of this short report . anyway , in general a comparison between the experimental data and the leading order predictions can be important and instructive .",
    "first , let us shortly remind the properties of the bjorken variable@xmath2 which plays a crucial role in phenomenology of lepton  nucleon scattering .",
    "regardless of mechanism of the process , this invariant parameter satisfies@xmath3 this is a very well - known textbook result . a possible proof is suggested also in @xcite .",
    "now let us consider a qpm approach , where the process of lepton ",
    "nucleon scattering is initiated by the lepton interaction with a quark ( see fig .",
    "[ fe1 ] ) , which obeys @xmath4     ( @xmath5 ) in initial ( final ) state , @xmath6 is initial nucleon momentum.,width=188 ]    the second equality implies@xmath7 which with the use of relation ( [ k1 ] ) gives@xmath8 the basic input for the construction of qpm is the assumption @xmath9 which allows us to identify@xmath10 and to directly relate the quark momentum to the parameters of scattered lepton",
    ". moreover , if one assumes@xmath11 where @xmath12 is the nucleon mass , then one can identify@xmath13 in any reference frame in which the first axis orientation is defined by the vector @xmath14 . this relation can be proved as follows .",
    "let us consider eq .",
    "( [ k7 ] ) in the same frame:@xmath15 in the nucleon rest frame we denote the photon momentum components by the subscript @xmath16 and using the usual symbol @xmath17 we have@xmath18 which with the use of eq .",
    "( [ k1 ] ) gives@xmath19 it means that for @xmath20 we obtain@xmath21 ( since for @xmath22 we have also @xmath23 so the ratio @xmath24 does not contradict eq .",
    "( [ ax7 ] ) . ) in a reference frame connected with the rest frame by the lorentz boost in the direction  opposite to @xmath25 we have the corresponding ratio@xmath26 now one can easily check that eq .",
    "( [ k7 ] ) with the use of this ratio and eq .",
    "( [ ax7b ] ) imply @xmath27 in this way we have proved that replacement of bjorken variable by the invariant light - cone ratio in eq .",
    "( [ k9 ] ) is valid provided the inequality ( [ k8 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the relation ( [ k9 ] ) expressed in the nucleon rest frame reads@xmath28 which after inserting into ( [ k2 ] ) gives@xmath29    however the most important reason why we require large @xmath30 is in physics . if we accept scenario when a probing photon interact with a quark , we need sufficiently large momentum transfer @xmath30 at which the quarks can be considered as effectively free due to asymptotic freedom . at small @xmath30 the picture of quarks ( with their momenta and other quantum numbers ) inside the nucleon disappear .",
    "the rs means that the probability distribution of the quark momenta @xmath31  in the nucleon rest frame depends , apart from @xmath30 , on @xmath32 .",
    "it follows that also @xmath33 is allowed , so together with the inequality  ( [ k11 ] ) we have@xmath34 the combinations of ( [ k11]),([k12 ] ) imply@xmath35 and if we again refer to rs , then further inequalities are obtained:@xmath36 and@xmath37 where@xmath38 obviously inequality ( [ k15a ] ) is satisfied also in any reference frame boosted in the directions @xmath39 .",
    "further , the above inequalities are apparently valid also for average values @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , if one assumes that @xmath42 distribution is a decreasing function , then necessarily@xmath43 the above relations are valid for sufficiently high @xmath30 suggested by eqs .",
    "( [ k6 ] ) and  ( [ k8 ] ) .",
    "let us note that the on - mass - shell assumption has not been applied for obtaining these relations .",
    "these inequalities can be compared with relations obtained in @xcite , where the additional on - mass - shell condition @xmath44 had been applied .",
    "corresponding relations are more strict:@xmath45 and@xmath46 however , it is clear that in general the on - mass - shell assumption is not realistic . in the next we will assume only the off - mass - shell approach .",
    "first let us summarize more accurately what we have done in the previous section .",
    "we assumed :    _ _ a ) lorentz invariance__it means that the theoretical description in terms of the standard kinematical variables ( see fig .",
    "[ fe1])@xmath47  can be boosted also to the nucleon rest frame .    _ b ) inequality _ @xmath48____it means that the light - cone ratio @xmath49 satisfies the same bound ( [ k2 ] ) as the bjorken variable @xmath50    _ _ c ) rotational symmetry__the kinematical region @xmath51 of the quark intrinsic momenta @xmath31 in the nucleon rest frame has rotational symmetry ( i.e. @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is any rotation in @xmath51 ) .",
    "for example , in terms of the covariant qpm it means that probabilistic distribution of the quark momenta is controlled by some function @xmath54 .",
    "we proved  these assumptions imply bounds ( [ k11])([k15a ] ) .",
    "now we will shortly comment on the obtained results :    _ i ) _ the ratio @xmath49 of light - cone variables ( [ k9 ] ) has a simple interpretation in a frame , where the proton momentum is large - @xmath49 is the fraction of this momentum carried by the quark .",
    "however an interpretation of the same variable in the nucleon rest frame is more complicated . in this frame",
    "the quark transversal momentum can not be neglected and @xmath49 depends on the both , longitudinal and transversal quark momenta components . in the limit of massless",
    "quarks the connection between the variable @xmath49 in ( [ k10 ] ) and the quark momenta components is given by the relations : @xmath55 these variables were used in our recent papers on tmds @xcite .",
    "simply the value of invariant variable @xmath49 does not depend on the reference frame , but its interpretation e.g. in the rest frame differs from that in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "_ ii ) _ the relations ( [ k15 ] ) , ( [ k15a ] ) , which follow from rs , can be confronted with the experimental data on @xmath41 or @xmath56 .",
    "we have discussed the available data in @xcite and apparently relation ( [ k15a ] ) is compatible with the set of lower values @xmath41 corresponding to the leptonic data. on the other hand the second set giving substantially greater @xmath41 and denoted as the hadronic data , seems to contradict this relation .",
    "actually the conflict with the relation ( [ k15a ] ) would mean either the conflict with some of the assumptions _",
    "a)c ) _ or simply it can be due to absence of the higher order qcd corrections .",
    "however , for possible comparison with the perturbative qcd approach @xcite let us remark the following .",
    "this approach generate evolved tmds using as input the existing phenomenological parametrizations extracted from the experimental data .",
    "for example , one of the inputs is the scale - independent gaussian fit @xcite@xmath57   } { \\pi\\left\\langle p_{t}^{2}\\right\\rangle } , \\label{k20}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 .",
    "obviously our concept rs defined above is hardly compatible with this distribution .",
    "in fact in the rest frame this distribution gives much greater @xmath59 than the corresponding longitudinal @xmath60term @xmath61 .",
    "however rs requires @xmath62 only .",
    "let us remark that this imbalance is of the same order as a difference between the two data sets mentioned above .",
    "_ iii ) _ the  first relation ( [ k15 ] ) apparently contradicts an intuitive , lorentz invariant condition@xmath63 corresponding to bound , space - like quarks",
    ". such conflict does not take place for the leading order with quarks on - mass - shell .",
    "however , for off - shell quarks the condition ( [ k20a ] ) is incompatible with the assumptions _",
    "a)c ) , _ which imply ( [ k15 ] ) . for example",
    "it means that any approach , which is based primarily on the assumption _ _ ( [ k20a ] ) in some starting reference frame ( including the infinite momentum frame ) can not simultaneously satisfy the conditions _ a)c)_.    _ iv ) _ in @xcite we explained why the rs , if applied on the level of qpm , follows from the covariant description . in fact it means the assumptions _",
    "a)c ) _ are common for our qpm and for the approaches like @xcite where only lorentz invariance is explicitly required .",
    "the predictions of all these models are compatible with the bound ( [ k15a ] ) .",
    "this is just a consequence of the fact that general conditions _",
    "a)c ) _ are satisfied in these approaches .",
    "another theoretical reasons for rs have been suggested in @xcite .",
    "let us remark that the rotational - symmetry properties of the nucleon state in its rest frame play an important role also in the recent studies @xcite .",
    "_ v ) _ the relation ( [ k17 ] ) is obtained for the quarks on - mass - shell . in a more general case , where only inequalities ( [ k15 ] ) , ( [ k15a ] ) hold ,",
    "this relation is replaced by@xmath64 where the term @xmath65 is not a parameter corresponding to the fixed mass , but it is only a number varying in the limits defined by ( [ k15 ] ) .",
    "the last relation implies for any @xmath65:@xmath66 which is equivalent to the on - mass - shell relation ( [ k17 ] ) for @xmath67 .",
    "this general upper limit for @xmath68  depending on @xmath49 is displayed in fig .",
    "let us remark that results on @xmath69 obtained in @xcite are compatible also with the bound ( [ k22 ] ) .",
    "an equivalent form of this inequality was probably for the first time presented in @xcite .     for @xmath70 ( solid line ) , @xmath71 ( dashed line ) , @xmath72 (",
    "dotted line ) and @xmath73 ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    ", width=226 ]",
    "in the present report we studied the kinematic constraints due to the rotational symmetry of the quark momenta distribution inside the nucleon in the leading order approach . in particular , we have shown that the light - cone formalism combined with the assumption on the rotational symmetry in the nucleon rest frame imply @xmath74 .",
    "only part of existing experimental data on @xmath41 satisfies this bound , but the another part does not . in general , the existing methods for reconstruction of @xmath41  from the dis data are rather model - dependent .",
    "these are the reasons why more studies are needed to clarify these inconsistencies , since the phenomenological distributions in the @xmath75 plane at present serve also as an input for a more fundamental calculation of the qcd evolution and other effects .",
