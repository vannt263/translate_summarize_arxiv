    "the first simple expressions of the number of standard young tableaux of given shape were given by frobenius and young ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and by frame - robinson - thrall @xcite .",
    "more recently , the number of standard young tableaux has been studied according to the height of their shape .",
    "regev @xcite gave asymptotic values for the numbers @xmath4 of standard young tableaux whose shape consists of @xmath2 cells and at most @xmath3 columns and stanley ( see @xcite ) discussed the algebraic or differentiably finite nature of the corresponding generating functions .",
    "more recently , many authors entered this vein .",
    "for example , d.gouyou-beauchamps gave both exact forms in @xcite and recurrence formulas ( see @xcite ) for the numbers @xmath4 when @xmath5 by combinatorial tools , while f.bergeron and f.gascon @xcite found some recurrence formulas for the numbers @xmath4 by analytic argumentations .",
    "in this paper we present a different approach to the subject .",
    "our starting point is the remark that the elements of the ballot matrix introduced by m.aigner in @xcite correspond bijectively to the integers counting standard young tableaux of a given shape with at most @xmath6 columns .",
    "firstly , we arrange the entries of the ballot matrix in a new lower triangular matrix @xmath7 in such a way that the entries of the @xmath2-th row count standard young tableaux with precisely @xmath2 cells .",
    "the integer @xmath8 can be therefore recovered by summing the elements of the @xmath2-th row of @xmath7 .    in the following sections , we extend the results to the general case of standard young tableaux with at most @xmath3 columns . for every fixed @xmath9 we define an infinite matrix @xmath0 whose @xmath10-th entry is the total number of standard young tableaux with at most @xmath3 columns and such that the difference between the length of the second and of the third column is @xmath11 .",
    "the total number @xmath4 of tableaux on @xmath2 cells with at most @xmath3 columns is the @xmath2-th row sum of the matrix @xmath0 .",
    "the matrix @xmath0 presents a three - term row - recurrence property , which yields a recurrence law satisfied by the integers @xmath4 .",
    "this recurrence allows to get a combinatorial interpretation of the asymptotic behaviour of the ratio @xmath12 in section [ ter ] we treat more extensively the case @xmath13 , in order to exhibit recursive and asymptotic properties for the integers @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes the @xmath2-th motzkin number .",
    "in the following , we will denote the shape of a standard young tableau @xmath16 as a list containing the length of the first , second , @xmath17 , last column of @xmath16 .",
    "we first consider the standard young tableaux whose shape consists of at most two columns .",
    "we define an infinite , lower triangular matrix @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of standard young tableaux whose shape corresponds to the list @xmath20 , with @xmath21 .",
    "the matrix @xmath7 can be recursively constructed as follows :    the matrix @xmath7 is defined by the following initial conditions :    * @xmath22 for every @xmath23 ; * @xmath24 for every @xmath25 ; * @xmath26 for every @xmath27    and by the recurrence : @xmath28    the initial conditions follow immediately by the definition of the matrix @xmath7 . in order to prove the recurrence , remark that a young tableau with @xmath2 cells can be obtained from a tableau with @xmath29 cells by adding a new box containing the symbol @xmath2 in a corner position . in particular , in a young tableau of shape @xmath20 , @xmath25 , the symbol @xmath2 can be placed in at most two corner cells . hence , the entry @xmath19 is the sum of the two integers @xmath30 and @xmath31 , that count the young tableaux of appropriate shape .",
    "the recurrence formula ( [ iv ] ) has as an immediate fallout the following result :    [ recdef]corollary    the entries of the matrix @xmath7 satisfy the following columnwise recurrence :    @xmath32 for every @xmath33 .",
    "we remark that the elements of the matrix @xmath7 correspond bijectively to the entries of the ballot matrix defined by aigner in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the ballot matrix @xmath34 can be obtained rearranging the entries of the matrix @xmath7 as follows : @xmath35 as a consequence , for every @xmath2 , the number of standard young tableaux with two columns of the same length @xmath2 is the @xmath2-th catalan number @xmath36 : @xmath37 .",
    "denote by @xmath8 the number of young tableaux with @xmath2 cells and at most two columns .",
    "obviously , we have : @xmath38 in the next theorem we deduce a recurrence formula for the sequence @xmath39 :    [ recdef]theorem    the integers @xmath8 , @xmath40 , satisfy the recurrence @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the @xmath11-th catalan number and @xmath43    by proposition [ inverso ] , we have : @xmath44@xmath45 as desired .    .",
    "]    the preceding result yields an alternative proof of the following theorem , originally proved by regev in @xcite :    [ recdef]theorem    the number of standard young tableaux with exactly @xmath2 cells and at most two columns is @xmath46    it is well known that the central binomial coefficients @xmath47 satisfy the recurrence ( [ peruno ] ) . remarking that @xmath48",
    ", we have the assertion .    moreover , identity ( [ peruno ] ) yields the following asymptotic property of the integers @xmath8 :    [ recdef]proposition    [ becchi ] we have : @xmath49    by ( [ peruno ] ) we get : @xmath50 this implies that the assertion is proved as soon as we show that @xmath51 if @xmath2 is even , this identity trivially holds . if @xmath2 is odd , the described correction term is negligeable with respect to @xmath52 as @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "in fact , we get : @xmath53 as required .",
    "we now extend the results of section [ sec ] to the case of standard young tableaux with at most three columns .",
    "define a matrix @xmath54 such that the @xmath10-th entry of @xmath55 is the total number of standard young tableaux of shape @xmath56 , for every possible value of @xmath57 .",
    "in other terms , the integer @xmath58 is the cardinality of the set @xmath59 containing all standard tableaux on @xmath2 cells with at most @xmath60 columns such that the difference between the second and third column is @xmath11 .",
    "the entries of the matrix @xmath55 satisfy a three - term recurrence :    [ recdef]proposition    [ chegli ] the integers @xmath61 satisfy the identity : @xmath62 moreover , for every @xmath63 , we have : @xmath64 where @xmath65    let @xmath16 be a standard young tableau @xmath16 with @xmath60 columns of shape @xmath56 , for some @xmath57 , and let @xmath66 be the tableau obtained from @xmath16 by removing the cell containing the symbol @xmath2 .",
    "obviously , the tableau @xmath66 has either shape @xmath67 or @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that the correspondence @xmath70 maps the set @xmath59 into the union @xmath71 . however , such map is not in general surjective .",
    "in fact , it is easy to check that the difference between the set @xmath72 and the image of the map consists exactly of the tableaux of shape @xmath73 .",
    "this proves ( [ igrande ] ) .",
    "the first recurrence can be proved by the same arguments , observing that , in this case , the map defined above is surjective .    the preceding result yields a recurrence formula satisfied by the total number @xmath74 of standard young tableaux with @xmath2 cells and at most @xmath60 columns :    [ recdef]theorem    [ ultcor ] the numbers @xmath74 , @xmath75 , satisfy the recurrence @xmath76where @xmath77    by definition of @xmath58 we have : @xmath78 hence , @xmath79 remark that @xmath80 the proof is an immediate consequence of the following considerations :    * the first summand in the right hand side of identity ( [ rihs ] ) is equal to @xmath81 if @xmath2 is even . in case of @xmath2 odd , instead , this term exceeds @xmath81 by the catalan number @xmath82 , * the second summand in the right hand side of identity ( [ rihs ] ) is exactly @xmath81 , * the third summand in the right hand side of identity ( [ rihs ] ) exceeds the integer @xmath81 exactly by @xmath83 , * the fourth summand in the right hand side of identity ( [ rihs ] ) is obviously equal to @xmath84 .    remark",
    "that an explicit evaluation of the integers @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be obtained via the well known hook length formula .",
    "previous considerations lead to the following result concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence @xmath74 :    [ recdef]proposition    [ aneso]for every integer @xmath40 , we have : @xmath87 moreover @xmath88    inequality ( [ maserv ] ) follows directly by previous considerations . in order to prove ( [ siche ] ) we remark that , by theorem ( [ ultcor ] ) , the ratio @xmath89 can be written as : @xmath90 where @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 the statement will be proved as soon as we show that each summand @xmath94 goes to @xmath95 as @xmath2 goes to infinity .",
    "the numerator of each @xmath94 is a sum of a suitable finite number @xmath96 . for every @xmath96 appearing in one of these expression , we can single out an appropriate subset @xmath97 of summands whose cardinality grows as @xmath2 goes to infinity , such that : @xmath98 for instance , consider the rectangular shape @xmath99 over @xmath29 blocks , namely , the shape corresponding to the values @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "obviously , such a shape exists only if @xmath102 ( mod 3 ) . in this case , the family @xmath103 consists of the shapes over @xmath29 cells and corresponding to the values @xmath104 , @xmath105 , where @xmath106 ranges from @xmath107 to @xmath108 . by hook length formula , we get : @xmath109 the sets @xmath110 corresponding to the other summand of each of the numerators of the @xmath94 can be described analogously .    as proved in @xcite , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the @xmath2-th motzkin number .",
    "hence , these last arguments yield a combinatorial proof of propositions @xmath111 and @xmath112 in @xcite .",
    "in this section we extend the previous argumentations to the general case of standard young tableaux with at most @xmath3 columns .",
    "define a matrix @xmath113 such that the @xmath10-th entry is the total number of standard young tableaux with at most @xmath3 columns and such that the difference between the length of the second and of the third column is @xmath11 .    also in this case , when @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the entries of this matrix satisfy a three - term recurrence .",
    "in fact , the following proposition can be proved by the same arguments used to prove proposition [ chegli ] :    [ recdef]proposition    the integers @xmath116 satisfy the identity : @xmath117 moreover , for every @xmath118 , we have : @xmath119 @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the number of standard young tableaux with at most @xmath3 columns such that the difference between the length of the second and of the third column is @xmath11 and the @xmath122-th and the @xmath123-th columns have the same length .    similarly , exploiting the same arguments as in proposition [ aneso ] , we get :    [ recdef]proposition    the numbers @xmath4 satisfy the recurrence : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the sum of all the correction terms appearing in formula _ ( [ i_grande])_.",
    "now we can easily deduce from these identities some information concerning the asymptotic behaviour of the sequence @xmath4 :    [ recdef]proposition    the sequence @xmath4 satisfies the following properties : @xmath126 @xmath127",
