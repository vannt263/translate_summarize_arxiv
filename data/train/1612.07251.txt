    "one of the striking predictions of quantum field theory ( qft ) is that virtual charged particle - antiparticle fluctuations in the quantum vacuum can induce nonlinear interactions among electromagnetic fields @xcite ; for reviews emphasizing various theoretical aspects as well as prospects for the experimental detection of such effects , see @xcite .",
    "aiming at probing the vacuum of the standard model of particle physics with classical electromagnetic fields and low energy photons , the dominant effective interactions are governed by quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .    for the macroscopic electromagnetic fields presently attainable in the laboratory , the effects of qed vacuum nonlinearities are rather small , making their experimental detection challenging @xcite .",
    "these effective interactions have no tree - level analogue , but are mediated by at least one electron - positron loop . for electromagnetic fields",
    "which vary on scales much larger than the compton wavelength of the electron @xmath0 and are weak in comparison to the critical electric field strength @xmath1 @xcite , i.e. , fulfill @xmath2 , this results in a parametric suppression of the effective interaction by inverse powers of the electron mass .",
    "most of the electromagnetic fields available in the laboratory meet this criterion .",
    "the effective interactions can in particular impact photon propagation and give rise to remarkable effects such as vacuum birefringence experienced by probe photons traversing a classical electromagnetic field @xcite ; for ongoing experimental efforts aiming on the verification of vacuum birefringence using macroscopic fields , see @xcite , for theoretical proposals advocating dedicated high - intensity laser experiments , see @xcite .",
    "recently , indications have been reported for the relevance of qed vacuum birefringence for optical polarimetry of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "other theoretical proposals for optical signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearity have focused on photon - photon scattering in the form of laser - pulse collisions @xcite , interference effects @xcite , quantum reflection @xcite , photon merging @xcite , photon splitting @xcite , and higher - harmonic generation from laser driven vacuum @xcite .",
    "finally , and perhaps most strikingly , strong electric fields can facilitate the spontaneous formation of real electron - position pairs from the qed vacuum via the schwinger effect @xcite .",
    "it is a fascinating aspect of this plethora of phenomena that they manifest the effective interactions of electromagnetic fields beyond maxwell s linear theory , which can be summarized elegantly by an effective action that dates back to the early days of quantum field theory @xcite : the heisenberg - euler effective action .",
    "its matured embedding into the modern language of field theory is due to schwinger @xcite who gave a nonperturbative definition of this action by means of the vacuum persistence amplitude , i.e. , the schwinger functional .",
    "nowadays , qft is often defined in terms of generating functionals for correlation functions , with the concept of the effective action being identified with the generating functions of one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) correlators ( proper vertices ) .    in this article",
    ", we emphasize that the heisenberg - euler effective action is different from  though related to  the 1pi effective action .",
    "this fact has , of course , been well known in the specialized literature @xcite but is sometimes confused in textbooks .",
    "we detail the construction of the heisenberg - euler effective action from the standard definition of qed in terms of the partition function in the present work . the difference between the two effective actions",
    "is manifested by one - particle reducible ( 1pr ) contributions to the heisenberg - euler action . in a perturbative loop expansion ,",
    "such 1pr contributions occur at and beyond the two - loop order . at two - loop order",
    ", we find that there is a finite 1pr contribution to the heisenberg - euler effective action in constant electromagnetic fields , which was previously believed to vanish .    using a locally constant field approximation ( lcfa )",
    ", we also study in detail the effective theory of slowly varying classical background fields and low - frequency photon fields in the qed vacuum .",
    "the photon polarization tensor derived within the latter contains 1pi , 1pr , as well as disconnected contributions , all of which can be understood as generated by the 1pi effective action .",
    "as higher - loop diagrams are typically suppressed in comparison to the one - loop diagram , a proper inclusion of the previously neglected 1pr diagrams is expected to impact the proposed experimental signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearities only at subleading order . in fact , most of the theoretical studies listed above exclusively limit themselves to one - loop order .",
    "for instance for vacuum birefringence in weak fields , the two - loop contribution represents only a 1%  correction @xcite .",
    "our article is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : hevs1pi ] is devoted to an in - depth discussion of the heisenberg - euler effective action .",
    "here we elaborate differences and common ground with respect to the standardized 1pi effective action and show how the heisenberg - euler effective action emerges from the microscopic theory of qed .",

    "moreover , a separation into internal and external fields might seem purely academic .",
    "nevertheless , this concept is perfectly adjusted to our perception of a real experiment in terms of classically controlled sources and detectors . in the remainder of this section ,",

    "the signal may often be of quantum nature , as it is , e.g. , the case for a single - photon signal to be measured in a single - photon detector .",
    "still , it is useful to think of the signal as a contribution to the external field @xmath14 , because it is ultimately measured far away from the region @xmath30 .    in order to distinguish between applied fields @xmath31 (",
    "e.g. , the fields provided by lasers , or magnets ) and the signal photons @xmath32 , one may decompose the external field as @xmath33 as the signal @xmath32 is eventually induced by @xmath31 , the two components of @xmath14 will typically exhibit a causal ordering in time .",
    "similarly , it is possible to distinguish between the source parts @xmath26 that are responsible for creating @xmath31 and those that interact with @xmath32 within the detectors .",
    "now , the quantitative success of classical electrodynamics heuristically implies that the effective self - interactions as well as mutual couplings of @xmath32 and @xmath31 mediated by quantum fluctuations @xmath34 are dramatically suppressed and essentially vanish outside the interaction volume @xmath30 . from the viewpoint of qed , this is a consequence of the locality of the theory and the smallness of its coupling .",

    "correspondingly , there is no need to consider ( casimir - like ) effects due to the finite volume of @xmath30 : the interaction volume can always be chosen large enough to render such effects negligible .",

    "<S> we study the effective interactions of external electromagnetic fields induced by fluctuations of virtual particles in the vacuum of quantum electrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> our main focus is on these interactions at two - loop order . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the emergence of the renowned heisenberg - euler effective action from the underlying microscopic theory of quantum electrodynamics , emphasizing its distinction from a standard one - particle irreducible effective action . in our explicit calculations </S>",
    "<S> we limit ourselves to constant and slowly varying external fields , allowing us to adopt a locally constant field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> one of our main findings is that at two - loop order there is a finite one - particle reducible contribution to the heisenberg - euler effective action in constant fields , which was previously assumed to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to their conceptual significance , our results are relevant for high - precision probes of quantum vacuum nonlinearity in strong electromagnetic fields . </S>"
