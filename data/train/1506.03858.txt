    "for instance , it has been found that eit and photon scattering can be used to tune photon transmission in optomechanical systems  @xcite .",
    "a tls coupled to the cavity field of an optomechanical system can affect the photon transmission and lead to nonclassical effects for the cavity field  @xcite .",
    "when the tls is a controllable superconducting qubit , we find that the eit window of the optomechanical system can be changed by the superconducting qubit , or , in other words , that the mechanical resonator can affect the absorption and dispersion of the circuit qed system  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mechanical resonator of an optomechanical system can also interact with a tls  @xcite , which can affect the ground state cooling of the mechanical resonator  @xcite , the nonlinearity of the cavity field  @xcite , and so on . when the cavity field in such a hybrid system is driven by a strong classical field and a weak probe field",
    ", the splitting of the phonon energy levels leads to two - color eit windows  @xcite , which can be switched to a single one by adjusting the transition frequency of the tls .",
    "photon control in an optomechanical system can also be realized via photon blockade and tunneling , which result from the nonlinearity of the cavity field .",
    "photon blockade prevents subsequent photons from resonantly entering the cavity , while the photon - induced tunneling increases the probability of subsequent photons entering the cavity .",
    "thus , photon blockade corresponds to a single - photon transition process , while photon tunneling corresponds to two - photon or multi - photon transition processes .",
    "if an optomechanical system coupled to a tls via a mechanical resonator , both the mechanical resonator and the tls can induce a nonlinearity in the cavity field , and thus they can be used to realize photon blockade and tunneling .",
    "photon blockade has been studied in various systems , e.g. , cavity qed  @xcite , circuit qed  @xcite , and optomechanical devices  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the single - photon blockade , multiphoton blockade was also studied theoretically ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) and even observed experimentally  @xcite . however , to our knowledge , there is no study on how to control photon blockade and tunneling .    in this paper",
    ", we study a method to tune photon blockade and anti - bunching in an optomechanical system via a tls which is coupled to the mechanical resonator of the optomechanical device .",
    "in such a hybrid system  @xcite , the dressed states formed by the mechanical resonator and the tls affect the photon and phonon blockade of the optomechanical system .",
    "it is known that the eigenstates of phonons in an optomechanical devices are described by displaced fock states  @xcite due to the phonon - photon coupling via the radiation pressure .",
    "therefore , the dressed states in the hybrid system should be more complicated , because they formed by the displaced phonon states of the mechanical resonator and the tls  @xcite .",
    "if the mechanical mode and the tls are in the ultrastrong coupling regime , the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) does nt work , the rabi type interaction should be considered .",
    "in particular , the effect of strong and ultrastrong coupling on the photon blockade is analyzed in many systems  @xcite .",
    "the model studied here is a combination of the usual prototype optomechanical models .",
    "hybrid systems composed of a tls coupled to the cavity field of an optomechanical system have been studied widely ( see , e.g. , the recent refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "specifically , we consider a standard hamiltonian for two interacting oscillators ( i.e. , optical and mechanical resonators ) in which the mechanical oscillator interacts also with a two - level system ( tls ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the model studied here is nontrivial because the couplings between its constituent subsystems are nonlinear .",
    "for example , the interaction between the two oscillators is proportional to the photon number and the position of a mechanical resonator .",
    "this nonlinear interactions can induce nonlinearity of the oscillators .",
    "for example , as will be shown below , the optical oscillator , due to its interaction with the mechanical oscillator , can be effectively described by a kerr - type nonlinearity .",
    "it is known that the standard kerr nonlinearity can induce various nonclassical effects  @xcite .",
    "these include self - squeezing  @xcite , generation of two - component  @xcite and multi - component  @xcite schrdinger cat states , and photon antibunching ( if the nonlinearity is driven ) .",
    "the latter is a signature of photon blockade ( also referred to as optical state truncation )  @xcite , as also studied here .",
    "the creation of photons due to the mechanical resonator ( i.e. , oscillating mirror , which causes time - dependent variations of the geometry of our mesoscopic optomechanical system ) can be interpreted as a result of the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) , which is also known as non - stationary casimir effect or motion - induced radiation ( from a dynamically deforming mirror ) . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite : `` the term ` dynamical casimir effect ' is used nowadays for a rather wide group of phenomena whose common feature is the creation of quanta ( photons ) from the initial vacuum ( or some other ) state of some field ( electromagnetic field in the majority of cases ) due to time - dependent variations of the geometry ( dimensions ) or material properties ( e.g. , the dielectric constant or conductivity ) of some macroscopic system . ''",
    "specifically , we can interpret the occurrence of photon blockade in the studied system as follows : as mentioned above , the nonlinear interaction between the mechanical and optical resonators of our system can induce an effective kerr - type nonlinearity of the optical resonator .",
    "this driven kerr nonlinearity can result in photon blockade .",
    "note that this driving is applied directly via the coupling of the mechanical and optical resonators ( being related to the dce ) and indirectly via the coupling of the mechanical resonator with the tls .",
    "the dce was studied in analogous systems in a number of recent works ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "in particular , ref .  @xcite analyzed strong modifications of the cavity field statistics in the dce due to the interaction with tlss . here",
    ", we study the effect of a single tls on photon blockade .",
    "the light generated via the dce can exhibit various nonclassical properties  @xcite including squeezing  @xcite .",

    "ii , we describe the theoretical model . in sec .",
    "iii , we write down the master equation and derive the analytical solution in the weak - pumping limit .",

    "it has been shown ( e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the mechanical resonator can mediate a kerr nonlinear interaction between photons of the cavity field in an optomechanical system . thus ,",

    "we find that the photon blockade of the optomechanical device is significantly affected by a tls when it is coupled to the mechanical resonator . compared with the results of only the optomechanical cavity , the tls shifts and splits the peaks and dips of the second - order degree of coherence of the cavity field in the optomechanical subset .",
    "we also find that the tls gives rise to several new peaks and dips in the second - order degree of coherence of the cavity field in the hybrid system .",
    "if the coupling strength ( between the mechanical mode and the tls ) is comparable or larger than the transition frequency of the tls , new blockade dips and resonant peaks appear for the second degree of coherence .",
    "moreover the new blockade dips and resonant peaks can be tuned if we change the transition frequency or the decay rate of the tls .",
    "the photon anti - bunching of hybrid systems can also be tuned if we change the parameters of the tls .",
    "that is , our study may provide a new method to control and tune the nonlinearity and nonclassical effect of the cavity field of the optomechanical system by coupling to a tunable tls .",
    "our calculation may also provide an approach to detect a low - frequency tls ( which might be a defect in a mechanical resonator ) using optomechanics .",
