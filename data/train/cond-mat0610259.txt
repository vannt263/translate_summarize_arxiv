    "the results of intensive research in quantum mechanics show ( @xcite-@xcite ) that the smooth wavelike quantum world contains elements of quantum complexity and that symptoms of chaos enter even into the wave patterns associated with atomic energy levels . starting with nuclear physics @xcite , one observes complexity in quantum phenomena in spectral features , eigenfunctions , dynamics of molecular processes , solid state physics and information science ( berry @xcite suggested the `` quantum chaology '' being the adequate term for a quantum system whose classical counterpart exhibits chaos instead the mostly used and widely accepted term `` quantum chaos '' ) .",
    "+ besides the quantum systems that exhibit chaos in the classical or a semiclassical limit there exists a class of quantum systems that do not have a naive classical or semiclassical counterpart .",
    "in addition , the way of passing to semiclassical approximation , e.g. , in spin - boson systems is not unique and presents essential ambiguity due to different possible ways of decoupling quantum variables@xcite .",
    "different ways of performing semiclassical approximation are known to lead to different answers concerning the chaotic behaviour of the system .",
    "this ambiguity means that a classical analogue of such a model is not well - defined and can not be a reliable object in exploring the quantum chaos issues .",
    "+ the class of `` spin - boson '' models , e.g. , two and more levels coupled to bosons ( vibrons , phonons , photons ) were reported to exhibit chaotic phenomena first by lewenkopf et al @xcite and cibils et al @xcite , and many others .",
    "fujisaki et al ( @xcite ) investigated the systems with the absence of a reasonable quasiclassical limit .",
    "there such phenomena as quantum tunneling and multi - mode nonadiabatic fluctuations lead to complicated wave packet dynamics which breaks down the born - oppenheimer adiabatic approximation .",
    "+ typical representative of such a non - adiabatic system is the two - level molecular system coupled with two vibron modes of different symmetry against the transformation of reflection  the jahn - teller ( jt ) class of models .",
    "the chaos in jt molecules was investigated within a generalized model by cederbaum et al in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "recently , yamasaki et al @xcite for the first time investigated a possibility of chaos in spectra of the e@xmath0e jt model .",
    "their analysis was based on the approximation of the hamiltonian by separating it into the adiabatic `` mexican hat '' potential and an additional part supplemented via a parameter for a nonlinear mode coupling of a trigonal symmetry to include the effect of fluctuations and non - integrability .",
    "thus , the nonlinearity was included via mode coupling in addition to the mean field bare part of the hamiltonian .",
    "the authors concluded that the quantum chaos reflected itself in the wigner level spacing distribution as a consequence of the said nonlinearity of the hamiltonian , meanwhile for the linear part the absence of these patterns was stated .",
    "+ in the light of said problems due to the absence of a reasonable quasiclassical approximation we have used an exact numerical approach to the characteristics of excited ( quasi - continuum ) spectra of the e@xmath0e jt model @xcite .",
    "this approach differs from that by yamasaki et al . in the following :",
    "a ) we _ do not _ introduce an explicit nonlinearity into the initial hamiltonian .",
    "however , its su(2 ) symmetry involves an _ intrinsic nonlinearity _ which is revealed by the exact elimination of the electronic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "b ) we started from the e@xmath1 model with different coupling strengths for both modes .",
    "the rotation symmetric e@xmath0e model represents its particular case with equal coupling constants and thus with the symmetry of higher ( rotational ) symmetry group [ the difference of the coupling constants in realistic systems is likely to be caused , for example , by the spatial anisotropy of crystals ] .",
    "the importance of starting from the more general symmetry is evident from the nature of quantum fluctuations : namely , the variational approach to e@xmath1 model used for the calculation of the ground state @xcite was shown to yield the largest deviations just for the rotation symmetric case . in the ground state an abrupt change of the energy at equal couplings is an artefact of the adiabatic approximation : the energy region of the quantum e@xmath8e model is situated within a smeared border around @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the coupling strengths of the antisymmetric and the symmetric modes , respectively ) between the `` selftrapping '' ( @xmath12 ) and `` tunneling '' ( @xmath13 ) part of the ground state of the model with broken rotational symmetry . in the smeared transition region",
    "both phases coexist and are quantum correlated ( entangled ) via nonlinear correlations between the modes . there",
    "the phonon - assisted ( by the symmetric mode ) tunneling contribution to the energy [ from the admixture of two reflection symmetric levels in the excitation reflection ansatz for the variational wave function @xcite ] results in the essential decrease of the ground state energy because of changing parity of the wave function by the parity reversal of the phonon @xmath14-coordinates by the operator @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 therefore , it has its consequence in a dramatic increase of the ham factor and in the corresponding decrease of the energy .",
    "+ excited states follow the structure of dominating selftrapping ( @xmath10 ) or tunneling ( @xmath11 ) interactions .",
    "the mixing of the phases due to the tunneling is amplified by the analogous to the above matrix element via the reflection change of the parity in matrix elements with excited wave functions .",
    "respective decrease of the energy manifests itself in the avoiding of the excited energy levels .",
    "+ the phase transition at @xmath18 to the rotational symmetry phase provides a representation by the additional rotational quantum number @xmath19 . at given @xmath19 in e@xmath8e model",
    "the analogous phonon assisted tunneling between adjacent excited levels occurs and is responsible for the flip ( kink ) between the levels ( this mechanism can be well recognized , e.g. , in fig .",
    "this nonlinear effect causes a mixture of the adjacent ( even and odd ) levels at stronger couplings and leads to the nucleation of the new kink lattice phase with increasing coupling constant .",
    "the tunneling mechanism due to short - range quantum fluctuations at large @xmath19 is then the origin of peculiarly irregular behaviour of the related level spacing distributions and does not allow for full developing of the wigner chaos .",
    "the phonon assisted tunneling and nucleation of the kink lattice phase can be also demonstrated within the formalism of a calogero - moser gas of pseudo - particles with repulsive interaction @xcite .",
    "the aim of this section is to explore the numerical solution of the e@xmath8e hamiltonian for the excited energy spectrum and wave functions in search for the statistical evidences of the symptoms of chaotic behaviour at the quantum level .",

    "the multitude of avoided crossings of energy levels is generally claimed to be a testimony of quantum chaos .",

    "it setforth reference patterns to which the presumably quantum chaotic systems should conform @xcite .",
    "the conventionally adopted statistical measures are either the short- or long - range statistics .",

    "the rmt leads to the indication of universality of level fluctuations conditioned solely by the time - reversal symmetry of the underlying hamiltonians : the fluctuation patterns show a transition from the poisson type to the gaussian ( orthogonal , unitary , symplectic ) type as the corresponding classical system shifts from the integrable to the chaotic regime .      the class of non - integrable spin - boson models is known to exhibit quantum chaotic symptoms for one - boson many - level ( @xmath43 ) cases .",

    "+ conventionally , the term `` quantum chaos '' is used to denote the traces of _ classical _ chaotic behavior at a quantum level .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the classical counterpart of the system under consideration can not be defined uniquely .",
    "the semiclassical approximation in two - level systems generically leads to classical chaotic patterns as a result of nonlinear coupling between two subsystems , boson and electron , considered respectively as classical and quantum ; the onset of classical chaos corresponds to the energies above the first diabatic line .",
    "it is to be emphasized that the mentioned chaotic behavior refers to purely quantum regime of medium @xmath19 and @xmath138 between the weak coupling with @xmath139 ( dimerized pairs of oscillators ) and strong coupling with @xmath140 ( kink lattice ) domains .",
    "thus , this chaotic behavior can be regarded as being of essentially quantum nature .",
    "one can conclude , that the mapping of the quantum system on the classical calogero - moser gas with repulsive interactions enables one to use the classical formalism for describing the system via its quantum numbers .",
    "so the remarkable feature of this approach is its ability to represent quantum chaos by classical equations .",
