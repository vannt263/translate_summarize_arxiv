    "perhaps the simplest mechanism of lepton number violation is the spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry .",
    "this possibility may be of relevance in nature if neutrino masses are lepton number violating .",
    "the associated goldstone boson , the majoron , has phenomenological consequences that have been studied in the context of a variety of models  @xcite .",
    "the majoron can be produced in neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite , leading to a distinctive form for the electron sum - energy spectrum .",
    "in addition , majorons might be discerned through their astrophysical effects , in particular , by altering the total neutrino luminosity from supernovae , and possibly also the energy spectra of different supernova neutrino flavors  @xcite .",
    "most majoron models have been formulated in the context of purely four - dimensional field theories .",
    "recent interest in the possibility of extra compactified spatial dimensions  @xcite has led to new variations  @xcite on the conventional majoron scenarios .",
    "mohapatra , _ et al . , _ @xcite have noted that a bulk majoron field in a five - dimensional theory leads to additional contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay from the majoron kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations that are kinematically accessible to the final state .",
    "such additional contributions would enhance the decay rate in a singlet majoron model so that effects could be manifest at a next - generation double beta decay experiment .",
    "in such a scenario , the additional kk contributions to the decay alter the shape of the electron sum energy spectrum ( _ i.e. _ the spectral index ) in a way that would distinguish it from that of a conventional majoron model .    in this note",
    ", we consider another possible signal for a singlet majoron that is defined on a compactified , extra - dimensional space .",
    "we will first assume that the scale of compactification @xmath4 is such that the lightest kk excitation is too heavy to participate in double beta decay , so that the effects discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite are absent .",
    "in addition , the compactification scale will be high enough in comparison to typical supernova core temperatures ( @xmath5  mev ) to evade additional astrophysical bounds on the kk modes .",
    "in other words , we restrict ourselves to a choice of parameters in which the lightest kk modes are not directly constrained by the same low - energy and astrophysical bounds as the zero mode .",
    "we then focus on high - energy processes in which the sum over majoron kk modes may still lead to a substantial enhancement . specifically",
    ", we consider the process @xmath6 , where @xmath3 represents a sum over undetected modes .",
    "searches for neutrinoless double beta decay require that the @xmath0 coupling to neutrinos is extremely small ( @xmath7 )  @xcite , so that the production rate for an individual mode @xmath1 is completely negligible",
    ". nevertheless , the number of kk modes between @xmath8  mev and the tev scale can be enormous and provides a partially compensating effect .",
    "our goal is to study this issue quantitatively in a simplified one generation majoron model in which the majoron can propagate in @xmath9 extra , compactified spatial dimensions .",
    "we will see that in the case where @xmath10 , allowed parameter choices exist where @xmath11 events per year might be produced at an nlc , while for larger @xmath9 the result is significantly suppressed .",
    "we consider a singlet majoron model , in which lepton number is a global symmetry that is broken spontaneously by a gauge singlet higgs field @xmath12 .",
    "the singlet is assigned @xmath13 units of lepton number ; operators of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a weak doublet lepton field and @xmath16 the standard model higgs , are allowed in the high energy theory and generate neutrino majorana masses when both @xmath12 and @xmath16 obtain vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "we study an extra - dimensional extension of the model in which the majoron may propagate in the bulk , while all other standard model fields are confined to an orbifold fixed point .",

    "the coupling @xmath20 is undetermined in the effective theory and @xmath23 represents the scale of new physics , which we identify as the reduced planck scale for the theory . as written in eq .",
    "( [ eq : theop ] ) , the field @xmath12 has mass dimension @xmath24 , where @xmath9 is the number of extra dimensions ; all other fields have their usual four - dimensional normalization .",
    "we first take into account spontaneous symmetry breaking and then integrate over the extra dimensions .",
    "one may assume simple potentials to assure that both @xmath16 and @xmath12 develop vacuum expectation values .",
    "for example , with @xmath25 one finds that @xmath26 we choose instead a model - independent approach and simply assume that suitable symmetry breaking sectors exist .",
    "we thus set @xmath27 where @xmath28  gev , and expand @xmath29 henceforth we focus on the pseudoscalar @xmath3 whose zero mode component corresponds to the conventional massless majoron field .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : theop ] ) it now follows that a neutrino majorana mass term is generated , @xmath30 where @xmath31 similarly , the majoron coupling @xmath32 can now be simplified by substituting the kk decomposition of the field j. for compactification on a circle , for example , we would expand @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the radius of compactification . since we would like to confine all fields other than @xmath3 to a 4d subspace we compactify instead on the orbifold @xmath36 , which effectively cuts the extra - dimensional space in half .",

    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : odd ] ) is over positive @xmath40 , excluding the zero mode .",
    "we assume that the majoron field is even under the orbifold parity so that couplings to matter at the fixed point @xmath43 are non - vanishing .",

    "( [ eq : even ] ) into eq .",

    "we let phenomenological considerations dictate our choice of model parameters .",
    "the coupling @xmath57 is nothing more that the conventional zero - mode majoron coupling to neutrinos .",

    ", we will avoid these excluded regions for a mildly large value of the operator coupling , @xmath61 . in addition , we take the compactification scale @xmath62  mev which is larger that the typical end point energies in neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath63  mev ) and supernovae core temperatures ( @xmath8  mev ) .",
    "this assures that there are no further restrictions on @xmath55 from the kk majoron states . since we will be primarily interested in effects at a @xmath64  tev nlc",
    ", we will take the cutoff of our theory to be somewhat higher , @xmath65  tev extra dimensions of radii @xmath66 ; this does not preclude other larger extra dimensions accessible to gravity only .",

    "desired values of @xmath69 may be obtained by adjusting @xmath56 ; we take @xmath70  ev in our estimates below .",
    "to calculate the cross section for @xmath71 , we evaluate the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ feyndiags ] .",
    "self - conjugacy of the majorana neutrino field @xmath52 leads to three distinct forms for the neutrino propagators . summing over these ,",
    "the majoron - neutrino vertex and internal lines in these diagrams take on the simplified form @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are momenta identified with @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , in the first diagram of fig .",
    "[ feyndiags ] . using this result ,",

    "( [ m1])-([m1m2 ] ) , we have averaged over the electron spins and summed over the @xmath88 polarizations .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath89 was computed symbolically using feyncalc  @xcite and is somewhat cumbersome , so we only present numerical results below . the differential cross section for producing one majoron mode of mass @xmath90",
    "may be written @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 are the center of mass and @xmath88 energies , respectively .",
    "the angles @xmath95 are defined relative to the beam direction , while the angle @xmath96 is the azimuthal separation between the two @xmath97 s . note that @xmath98 is fixed by the energy - conserving delta function in the lorentz - invariant phase space , @xmath99 where @xmath100 are the @xmath97 momenta and @xmath101 is the mass of a given majoron kk mode .    the process of interest to us , however , is not the production of a single kk mode , but a sum over all kk modes that are kinematically accessible .",
    "we therefore multiply eq .",
    "( [ xsect ] ) by the multiplicity of kk modes per unit mass .",
    "hence , @xmath102 the new multiplicative factor can be derived from the surface area of a @xmath9-dimensional sphere in @xmath103 space , where @xmath104 .",
    "the additional factor of @xmath105 corrects for overcounting arising from the restriction on the values of @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : even ] ) .    \\4 . in    total and differential",
    "cross sections may be obtained by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : fform ] ) .",
    "we evaluated the total cross section @xmath106 and the @xmath97 sum energy distribution @xmath107 , where @xmath108 , for the parameter choices described at the end of section  [ sec : two ] .",
    "numerical integration was performed using three independent monte carlo integration packages ( mathematica , the cernlib routine divon4  @xcite , and the numerical recipes package vegas  @xcite ) , and consistent results were obtained .",
    "[ fig : xsec ] shows the total cross section in picobarns as a function of center of mass energy for one and two extra dimensions .",
    "a cut on @xmath109 was employed to eliminate events where one or more of the @xmath97 s are close to the beam direction .",
    "we do not find that our results vary strongly with this choice .",
    "conveniently , this cut also eliminates a kinematical region where there are infrared divergences that must be cancelled by including higher - order corrections . for a @xmath110  tev nlc with a luminosity of @xmath111  @xmath112  s@xmath113  @xcite",
    ", we find that one year of running yields @xmath114 and @xmath115 events for one and two extra dimensions , respectively . for larger values of @xmath9 the results",
    "are further suppressed so that detection at a tev scale machine looks less promising . in the @xmath10 case ,",
    "we display the @xmath97 sum energy spectrum in fig .  [ fig : etdist ] , which may be useful in distinguishing majoron production from other physics backgrounds , in particular , from those in which missing energy is not expected .    \\4 . in",
    "in this letter we have considered possible phenomenological consequences of a bulk majoron scenario , in a limit where the kaluza - klein excitations of the majoron @xmath1 are too heavy to have an effect on double beta decay measurements . exploiting the analogy to graviton production , we entertained the possibility that the sum over kk modes would be sufficient to compensate for the weakness of the majoron - neutrino coupling and lead to potentially observable collider signatures .",
    "we showed the the rate for the process @xmath6 , where @xmath3 represents the sum over majoron kk modes that go undetected experimentally , is not negligible at a tev - scale lepton collider .",
    "in addition , we presented numerical results for the @xmath97 sum - energy spectrum , which might be relevant experimentally .",
    "it is worth pointing out that one possible physics background to the majoron production process we consider is @xmath116 , which is lepton number violating and does not occur in the standard model .",
    "however , this background may arise due to other nonstandard sources of lepton number violation in the theory : the presence of an extra , heavy majorona neutrino , for example , can lead to @xmath117 production via its @xmath118-channel exchange  @xcite , while the @xmath119-channel exchange of an exotic doubly - charged higgs in some models  @xcite can have the same effect . distinguishing kk majoron production from these possibilities should be easy since majoron production implies a nontrivial @xmath120 sum energy spectrum , while the other cases yield no missing energy if the @xmath97 s are completely reconstructed .",
    "standard model backgrounds like @xmath121 generally require that both final state electrons are missed _ and _ that the @xmath97 charges are not identified .",
    "if both @xmath97 bosons decay leptonically , adequate charged lepton identification is required to suppress this background in determining total event rates . to find angular or sum energy distributions , it is instead desirable to consider the decays of both @xmath97 bosons to jets , so that the @xmath97 momenta can be completely reconstructed . in this case",
    "it may still be possible to reduce the background from missed final - state electrons by using jet charge identification techniques to determine the @xmath97 charges . while this is nontrivial",
    ", the use of neural networks in extracting the charges in @xmath97 pair production appears to be a promising approach  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the discussion in this letter has focused on a one - generation model while realistic three - generation theories would necessarily involve lepton - flavor changing effects . a phenomenological analysis like that in ref .",
    "@xcite , that takes into account simultaneous bounds on the majoron coupling and on the neutrino mass matrix , would be well motivated .",
    "explicit model building may also be useful in explaining the choice of parameters and scales that were selected in the present analysis for their phenomenological relevance , and would provide a framework for addressing cosmological issues . in any case ,",
    "our immediate results suggests that the future collider searches for lepton number violation in the  inverse beta decay \" channel may have a renewed , extra - dimensional motivation .",
