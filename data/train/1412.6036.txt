    "physics at the planck scale must incorporate quantized gravity and the correct way to describe physical events at that scale must be either a quantum theory of gravity or string theory .",
    "these theories suggest that spacetime may be noncommutative at a length scale of the order of planck length .",
    "there is strong evidence from observational data that inflation  @xcite , a period of accelerated expansion in the very early history of the universe , happened when the energy scale of the universe was about three orders of magnitude lower than the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "because of the accelerated expansion very small distances got stretched to cosmological sizes during inflation .",
    "if spacetime is noncommutative at very small length scales then such scales would have been stretched to possibly detectable cosmological sizes at the end of inflation .",
    "so , inflation provides a window of opportunity for probing planck scale physics .",
    "inflation is usually modeled to arise due to the evolution of a scalar field , the so - called inflaton field .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field provide the initial seeds of gravitational potential wells around which matter could cluster and form structures .",
    "if spacetime is noncommutative the statistical properties of these quantum fluctuations must be affected by it .",
    "fluctuations seen in the temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation  @xcite encode information about the physical properties of the universe , its evolution and the properties of the primordial fluctuations generated during inflation .",
    "the cmb is possibly the cleanest means to understand the properties of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "investigations on the effect of spacetime noncommutativity on inflation and signatures in the cmb have been carried out in several works  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "the authors obtained a constraint on the noncommutativity parameter using data from wmap  @xcite , acbar  @xcite and cbi  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of noncommutativity of spacetime on the two - point correlations of the cmb temperature fluctuations along the same line as  @xcite .",
    "we first analyze the effect of the noncommutativity parameter on the theoretical cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "we find that its effect is most pronounced in the range of scales probed by the planck mission and hence , planck data are best suited for constraining it .",
    "we further analyze the effect on the angular power spectrum of the @xmath0 mode of cmb polarization",
    ". then we perform monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) analysis to obtain the constraint on the noncommutativity parameter using data from planck  @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) from sdss - dr9  @xcite and the 6dfgs  @xcite and bicep2  @xcite .",
    "we obtain about a factor of 2 tighter constraint on the noncommutativity parameter in comparison to the value obatined in  @xcite .",
    "the improved constraint comes primarily from the higher resolution and accuracy of planck compared to wmap , acbar and cbi .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the basics of noncommutative spacetime , quantum fields on such a spacetime and the effect on inflaton fluctuations . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss the consequence on the angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations of the cmb . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the mcmc analysis and present our results .",
    "we end with a summary and discussion in section v.",
    "in this section we briefly review the basic equations of noncommutative spacetime and how its effect manifests in the angular power spectrum of the cmb temperature fluctuations and @xmath0 mode of polarization .",
    "we follow the formulation in  @xcite . if spacetime is noncommutative the coordinate operators , @xmath1 , do not commute and instead take the form @xmath2 = i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu } , \\label{eqn : xcom}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is an antisymmetric constant matrix with dimension @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be in the third direction .",
    "then @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the unit vector @xmath8 .",
    "this relation is not invariant under lorentz transformation ( but is invariant under a deformed lorentz symmetry ) . for cosmological application",
    "a natural choice of coordinates is the one where the time coordinate measures the proper time for an observer in a galaxy and the spatial coordinates measure the physical distances in such spatial slices .",
    "so what enters on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : xcom ] ) is the physical @xmath3 which is constant throughout the history of the universe .    if instead we choose conformal coordinates , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : xcom ] ) will have the same form , with @xmath1 now being coordinates in the conformal frame and @xmath3 will no longer be time independent .",
    "@xmath3 in the two frames will be related to each other as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the scale factor of expansion of space and the upper scripts are `` ph '' for physical and ` co ' for conformal .",
    "we carry out the computations here in the comoving frame and only in the end translate the result into the physical frame .",
    "for simplicity of notation we use @xmath3 where we actually mean @xmath11 .    in noncommutative spacetime",
    "the requirement of consistent statistics leads to deformation of the quantum fields , @xmath12 , in comparison to fields on commutative spacetime , @xmath13 .",
    "when applied to the context of cosmological scalar perturbations generated during inflation the deformation of the mode expansion of the fields leads to a primordial power spectrum of scalar perturbations , whose form is modified from the corresponding expression in commutative spacetime , given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the usual direction independent power spectrum in the commutative case given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the amplitude , @xmath18 the spectral index and @xmath19 a pivot scale that can be suitably chosen .",
    "then , the angular power spectrum of the cmb temperature fluctuations is given by @xmath20 where the function @xmath21 is the modified spherical bessel function of the first kind , given by @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the hubble parameter during inflation . for details of the calculations of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : pphitheta ] ) and ( [ eqn : cl_tt ] ) we refer to  @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 is the transfer function for temperature fluctuations which encodes the physical processes relevant within the causal patches of the universe during the decoupling and subsequent epochs . in writing this equation",
    "we have implicitly assumed that @xmath25 is not affected by the noncommutavity of spacetime and it is reasonable to do so since the noncommutativity scale is expected to be much smaller than the scales at which the transfer function is relevant .",
    "a small fraction of the cmb photons , those that had their last scattering from free electrons towards the end of the decoupling epoch , are polarized due to velocity gradients in the plasma .",
    "the polarization degrees of freedom are usually decomposed into the so - called @xmath0 and @xmath26 modes  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of the @xmath0 mode originate from the primordial scalar perturbations while fluctuations of the @xmath26 mode arise from primordial tensor perturbations .",
    "actually @xmath0 mode fluctuations also depend on primordial tensor perturbations but the effect is subdominant since the amplitude of tensor fluctuations is much smaller than that of scalar fluctuations . hence we ignore it here .",
    "the effect of noncommutativity on the @xmath0 mode of polarization can then be deduced along the same lines as done for temperature fluctuations in  @xcite .",
    "the angular power spectrum of @xmath0 mode is obtained to be @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the corresponding transfer function function for @xmath0 mode .",
    "in this section we estimate the effect of @xmath29 on @xmath30 , where the index @xmath31 refers to either ` @xmath32 ' or ` @xmath33 ' . to show the results we use the variable @xmath34 which is related to @xmath30 as @xmath35 we denote @xmath36 and study how varying @xmath37 affects @xmath34 . for calculating @xmath30 we use the publicly available cosmological boltzman code ` camb `  @xcite . `",
    "camb ` essentially calculates the respective transfer functions , @xmath38 , for temperature fluctuations and for the @xmath0 and @xmath26 modes of polarization .",
    "then it integrates over @xmath39 to get the @xmath40 , using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cl_tt ] ) , ( [ eqn : cl_ee ] ) and a corresponding equation for the @xmath26 mode , for commutative spacetime without the @xmath21 factor . for our purpose",
    ", we modify ` camb ` to incorporate @xmath21 in the expression for the primordial scalar power spectrum .",
    "we calculate @xmath41 for different values of @xmath37 and then calculate the difference @xmath42 to see how the difference changes systematically as we vary @xmath37 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dcl_tt ] we have plotted @xmath43 for different values of @xmath37 . ` camb ` uses units where @xmath39 is given in @xmath44 and so @xmath37 is in units of mpc .",
    "the @xmath45cdm cosmological parameters used are the planck best - fit values  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath46 asymptotically goes to one as @xmath47 and monotonously increases as @xmath48 increases , we observe an overall increase in the amplitude of @xmath49 as @xmath37 increases . as seen in the top panel of figure  ( [ fig : dcl_tt ] ) we find that @xmath43 is largest in the multipole range @xmath50 , which is the range probed by planck .",
    "the deviation amplitude drops sharply as @xmath37 decreases and in the top lower panel of the same figure we have shown @xmath43 with log scale on the @xmath51-axis to highlight the sharpness of the amplitude drop .",
    "the plots in the bottom panel are @xmath52 with linear and log scale on the @xmath51 axis and they bring out the effect of @xmath21 . in  @xcite , five years data from wmap which give information up to about @xmath53 were used to constrain @xmath29 .",
    "our calculation here shows that we can expect significantly tighter constraint if we use data from planck .",
    "figure  ( [ fig : dcl_ee ] ) shows the effect of @xmath37 on @xmath54 and all the panels are similar to those in figure  ( [ fig : dcl_tt ] ) .",
    "we find that the amplitude of @xmath55 is just over two orders of magnitude lower than seen for temperature fluctuations .",
    "the ratio @xmath56 has similar values . from this",
    "we conclude that though polarization data provide independent information about the properties of the universe we can not expect significant improvement on constraints on @xmath29 from @xmath0 mode data .",
    "based on the above discussion , in this section we compare the standard @xmath45cdm cosmological model with noncommutative spacetime with data of cmb temperature fluctuations from planck .",
    "we also use bao data from sdss  @xcite and 2dfgs  @xcite , and cmb polarization data from bicep2  @xcite .",
    "the cosmological parameters are the baryon density @xmath57 , cold dark matter density @xmath58 , the hubble parameter @xmath59 , optical depth to reionization @xmath60 , the amplitude @xmath17 and spectral index @xmath18 of primordial scalar fluctuations .",
    "in addition , we include the noncommutative parameter @xmath61 .",
    "we perform a bayesian statistical inference analysis using the publicly available mcmc cosmological parameter estimation package ` cosmomc `  @xcite . to calculate the theoretical angular power spectra for temperature fluctuations and @xmath0 mode , which go in as inputs for the likelihood analysis",
    ", we use our modified version of ` camb ` described in the previous section .",
    "we adopt the gelman - rubin convergence criterion @xmath62 when generating multiple markov chains , where @xmath63 is the _ variance of chain means _ divided by the _",
    "mean of chain variances_. we use the default flat priors given in ` cosmomc ` for the standard model parameters .",
    "for @xmath37 we use a flat prior with the upper limit value @xmath64 and lower limit @xmath65 .",
    "the upper limit was chosen so that we have a range wide enough to accommodate the constraint obtained by  @xcite .",
    "for the lower limit we did several runs of ` cosmomc ` with progressively smaller values starting from @xmath66 and ensured that our results are stable .",
    "we run ` cosmomc ` using various combinations of observational data sets . here",

    "the largest multipole for planck data is @xmath67 .",
    "we first describe the result obtained using planck data alone . in figure  [ fig:1d ]",
    "we have plotted the one - dimensional mean ( dashed lines ) and marginalized ( solid lines ) likelihood curves for @xmath37 .",

    "if we assume that the temperature of reheating of the universe was close to the gut energy scale , @xmath84gev , then the scale factor at the end of inflation is roughly @xmath85 . using this",
    "we obtain the constraint on the noncommutativity parameter to be @xmath86 at 1-@xmath68 and @xmath87 at 2-@xmath68 .",

    "note that these numbers will scale correspondingly if the reheating temperature is different . comparing our 1-@xmath68 bound with that in  @xcite",
    "we find a factor of 2 improvement in the constraint on the noncommutativity length scale .",
    "we confront the prediction of noncommutative spacetime , which is essentially captured by a modification of the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations , with observational data from planck , bao and bicep2 .",
    "we first analyze the effect of spacetime noncommutativity on the theoretical angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations and @xmath0 mode of polarization of the cmb .",
    "we find that the effect is most pronounced in the multipole range @xmath50 , implying that planck data will provide more stringent constraint in comparison to using wmap data .",
    "we also find that the effect on the angular power spectrum of @xmath0 mode is much weaker than in temperature fluctuations and hence inclusion of @xmath0 mode data will not significantly improve the constraint .    to obtain the constraint on the spacetime noncommutativity scale , @xmath82",

    "we find that @xmath82 is constrained to be smaller than @xmath88 at 1-@xmath68 confidence level which is a factor of 2 improvement from the previous limit obtained using data from wmap , acbar and cbi .",
    "the improvement comes from the higher angular resolution of planck in comparison to wmap , and higher precision in comparison to acbar and cbi even though they probed comparable smaller angular scales .    since the effect of the spacetime noncommutativity decreases at multipoles higher than 3000 it is expected that including cmb data at smaller scales will not improve the constaint significantly .",
    "further , our finding that the effect on the angular power spectrum of @xmath0 mode is much weaker than in temperature fluctuations suggests that inclusion of @xmath0 mode data will also not significantly improve the constraint .",
    "the effect of spacetime noncommutativity also affects the power spectrum of the primordial tensor modes  @xcite and will show up in the angular power spectrum of @xmath26 mode polarization . in our analysis we have not included this effect .",
    "this will not impact our results since the bicep2 data are restricted to lower @xmath89 values where the effect of spscetime noncommutativity is negligible .",
    "the results of the bicep2 experiment have been recently updated in a joint analysis by the bicep2 and planck teams  @xcite and there is no statistical significant detection of @xmath26 mode .",
    "this does not affect our result here . in the future",
    "the inclusion of high - resolution data of @xmath26 modes can potentially tighten the constraint on @xmath82 , subject to improvement in our ability to disentangle physical effects that are important at smaller scales such as gravitational lensing due to large - scale structure .",
