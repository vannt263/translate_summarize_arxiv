    "it is well known that definite aspects of chaotic motion of quasi - free charge carriers in many materials can be described in terms of diffusivity , @xmath0 , and mobility , @xmath1 .",
    "according to definitions of these quantities in statistical physics , if @xmath2 is displacement , or path , of a carrier during time interval @xmath3 , and @xmath4 much exceeds characteristic memory time , @xmath5 , of carrier s random walk , then @xmath6 where the angle brackets @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote averaging over thermodynamically equilibrium statistical ensemble and non - equilibrium one in presence of sufficiently weak force @xmath9 per carrier ( to be precise , we consider projections of vectors just onto direction of this force ) .",
    "thus , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are averages over infinite variety of carriers . however , in practice many authors interpret relations ( [ d])-([mu ] ) in the form like @xmath10 where @xmath11 is `` diffusive component '' of the displacement .",
    "thus , the ensemble averages@xmath0 and @xmath1 are assigned to a separate carrier as characteristics of its individual random trajectory !",
    "such the arbitrariness , or `` scientific fiction '' , implies illusion of complete knowledge of non - equilibrium noise which stays the same as in equilibrium .",
    "consequently , in view of the einstein relation , @xmath12 , one may think that at @xmath13 , where @xmath14 the carriers displacement is almost non - random , and therefore the time - of - flight measurements of transient photocurrents ( see e.g. works @xcite and references therein ) should give nearly ideal responses to pulse - like or step - like excitation ( see fig.1 and fig.2 ) .    in reality one observes @xcite something qualitatively different , similar to what is shown in in fig.1 and fig.2 .",
    "such the difference is conventionally explained as result of random variations of time of flight ( tof ) because of trapping and de - trapping of excess carriers by localized states ( the so - called `` dispersive transport '' , see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this explanation indeed is good in many characteristic cases .",
    "but in many other cases it seems unsatisfactory .",
    "perhaps , by this reason , for instance , in @xcite the idea of `` frozen '' spatial variations of mobility was suggested .",
    "quite another explanation arises when one understand that the fantastic expression ( [ si ] ) should be replaced by a realistic one , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is random quantity even in absence of the trapping , merely because a separate carrier has no definite mobility ( as well as a separate person does not have `` mean life '' and even may not know about it ) !",
    "this statement is irrefutable , but its comprehension is prevented by prejudices of the naive probability - theoretical way of thinking instead of the fundamental statistical - mechanical one @xcite .",
    "for the first this statement was argued in @xcite in the course of unprejudiced statistical analysis of random walks of atomic - size particles and later in @xcite ( or see @xcite ) and in @xcite was confirmed , by example of fluid molecules , as consequence of the first - principle equations of statistical mechanics .",
    "importantly , according to these investigations , a magnitude of fluctuations ( uncertainty @xcite ) of individual mobility of charge carrier is generally on order of it itself ( i.e. @xmath17 )",
    ". therefore probability distributions of @xmath2 taken at different values of the dimensionless force @xmath18 ( see above ) differ one from another not only by their mean positions but also by their widths and shapes , as it is shown in fig.3 , so that real drift of a packet of even non - interacting carriers is accompanied by its spreading , approximately proportionally to both @xmath4 and @xmath9 .",
    "particular results of such drift are the dark - curve time dependencies in figs.1 - 2 .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is just to demonstrate that these effects of the native carrier s mobility fluctuations resemble effects of the trapping .",
    "introducing related fluctuating diffusivity @xmath19 , one can ask equivalently : why carrier s diffusivity fluctuates by itself ? the cause was explained in the mentioned works .",
    "it is temporal non - locality of such physical characteristics as diffusivity : the latter by its sense describes random motion of a carrier ( or a particle in general ) during time intervals significantly greater than the memory time @xmath5 .",
    "therefore at the end of any such interval the system already does not remember what took place at its beginning .",
    "consequently , the system can not keep a definite value of the diffusivity .",
    "ideal ( fat grey curve ) and actual ( dark curve ) transient photocurrent responses to switching on illumination .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is is mean time of flight .",
    ", width=302,height=264 ]    if it is seen , then it is clear that resulting fluctuations ( uncertainty ) of diffusivity ( and hence mobility ) , firstly , by their order of magnitude are comparable with its average value .",
    "secondly , they can be arbitrary long , that is have no characteristic time scale , and thus represent a `` flicker noise '' whose power spectrum @xmath21 unboundedly grows at @xmath22 .",
    "thirdly , their probability distribution is close to a stable one .",
    "distribution , considered as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath23 , in the conventional `` fantastic '' model ( [ si ] ) ( four identical symmetric bell  shaped curves ) and in realistic model ( [ ri ] ) according to results of @xcite ( dark asymmetrical curves ) .",
    "the most left bell  shaped curve corresponding to @xmath24 is common for both models .",
    "the two most right fat curves demonstrate qualitative difference of the models at @xmath25 .",
    ", width=302,height=264 ]    additional reasonings can be found in @xcite . to confirm them at fundamental level",

    "@xcite at different values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the fat grey curve illustrates the diffusivity and mobility distribution ( 10 ) @xcite .",
    "all three distributions have power - law long tail with the exponent between 2 and 3 ( somehow cut off far on the right ) .",
    "the inset : the same in double - logarithmic scale .",
    ", width=302,height=264 ]    for the first such investigation was made in @xcite ( or see @xcite ) where thermodynamically equilibrium random walk @xmath2 of an electron ( or other particle ) in spatially uniform medium was considered basing on the only assumption that it possesses diffusive scale invariance , @xmath30 ( the tilde symbolizes statistical equivalence ) but destroyed at some microscopic time scales @xmath5 and @xmath31 ( e.g. mean free path or mean hop length of the particle under consideration ) . it was shown that at @xmath32 and @xmath33 the characteristic function of @xmath2 can be approximately expressed by @xmath34}\\rangle\\,=\\ , \\exp{\\left[\\,-dk^2t\\,\\,\\frac { \\ln{(\\tau_0/t+r_0 ^ 2k^2)}}{\\ln{(\\tau_0/t)}}\\right ] } \\,\\,\\ , \\label{cf0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the corresponding statistics can be named `` quasi - gaussian '' @xcite .",
    "similar analysis of non - equilibrium situation , when the particle is affected by an external force @xmath9 , needs in the help of the `` generalized fluctuation - dissipation relations '' @xcite which show @xcite that at sufficiently weak force , in the sense of @xmath35 , the characteristic function can be obtained by simple replacement in ( [ cf0 ] ) , namely , @xmath36 ( thus the einstein relation extends from mean values to fluctuations of diffusivity and mobility ) .",
    "therefore , at @xmath13 , neglecting in ( [ ri ] ) the diffusive part @xmath37 of @xmath2 , one can write approximately @xmath34}\\rangle\\,=\\ , \\exp{\\left[\\,ik\\mu f t\\,\\,\\frac { \\ln{(\\tau_0/t - ikfr_0 ^ 2/t)}}{\\ln{(\\tau_0/t)}}\\right ] } \\,\\,\\ , \\label{cf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the corresponding statistics can be named `` quasi - cauchy '' since the corresponding probability distributions ( see dark curves in fig.4 ) are similar to the asymmetric stable cauchy distribution @xcite ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "just such statistics implies the displacement distributions shown in fig.3 by dark curves .",
    "its physical meaning was explained in @xcite .",
    "one can see that characteristic functions like ( [ cf0 ] ) and ( [ cf ] ) mean presence of `` flicker '' , or 1/f - noise type , fluctuations in diffusivity and mobility , with low - frequency power spectrum @xcite @xmath38 this theoretical estimate very well agreed with experimental data in 1983 @xcite and equally well agrees with new data about semiconductors @xcite , carbon nano - tubes @xcite , graphene layers and graphene transistors @xcite and other electronic devices ( at that revealing origin of typical values of the `` hooge constant '' , @xmath39 @xcite ) .",
    "it should be underlined again and again that this 1/f - noise is by its nature an integral part of the atomic thermal motion and exists even in ideal crystal structure in absence any traps ( see explanations in @xcite ) !",
    "the fundamental microscopic approach to analogous diffusivity and mobility fluctuations so far was tried only in case of molecular random walks in fluids @xcite , on the base of the exact bogolyubov equations @xcite .    in @xcite ( see also @xcite )",
    "it was found , for atoms of a gas , that @xmath40 which satisfactorily agrees with experimental data on electrolytes @xcite ( where the hooge constant is anomalously large ) .",
    "values . on the right : the same in double logarithmic scale .",
    "the dot line indicates slope -1.,width=642,height=264 ]     values . in the inset : the same in double logarithmic scale.,width=302,height=264 ]    but the underlying probability distribution of diffusivity and mobility remained unknown .",
    "it was found in @xcite by means of more rough but deeper penetrating approximation , and its density can be expressed as @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "the spectrum ( [ sp1 ] ) arose in the case when @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding probability density @xmath44 is shown in fig.4 by far grey curve .",
    "evident property of all obtained distributions is that their most probable values are significantly smaller ( three times at @xmath43 ) than their mean values .",
    "thus , both phenomenological and microscopical approaches to the native thermal mobility fluctuations ( when being correctly performed ) gave qualitatively identical results .",
    "the tof measurements of excess ( injected ) probe particles , e.g. photo - excited charge carriers , usually presume that @xmath45 . according to the aforesaid",
    ", this means that @xmath46 , that is at corresponding time intervals contribution to particle s path fluctuations from 1/f diffusivity / mobility fluctuations exceeds contribution from diffusion itself ( i.e. from white thermal noise ) . in other words ,",
    "tof experiments are first of all observations of the native diffusivity / mobility 1/f - noise .",
    "hence , it is reasonable first to consider such imaginary ( but not fantastic ) situations when the above mentioned simple theory is sufficiently adequate .",
    "this would determine a background of the tof spectra which exists even in absence of specific effects like the `` dispersive transport '' ( transport via a large number of free electron traps ) jot taken into account by the theory .    at @xmath47",
    ", if knowing the mobility probability distribution , one can easy find that of tof @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is distance to be overcame ) and resulting time dependence of transient current ( flow ) , and vice versa . the distributions corresponding to characteristic function ( [ cf ] ) have no simple analytic expression but can be approximated by simple related distributions ( 10 )",
    ". then calculation of of transient current become so trivial that its description can be omitted .",
    "the results for short - pulse and step - like excitations are demonstrated on fig.6 and fig.7 where the currents are normalized to unit start value and unit steady - state value , respectively ( @xmath50 there is mean tof value ) .",
    "visual comparison of our figs.6 and 7 with experimental data graphically resented in @xcite ( and similar works ) shows rather high degree of correlation between one and another .",
    "this , gives evidence that many observations can be explained by equilibrium mobility / diffusivity 1/f - type fluctuation accompanying usual , `` non - dispersive '' , transport . on the other hand",
    ", we can say that many observations , when even their authors have doubts as to `` dispersive transport '' , do proof that the latter is not unique cause of tof and mobility distributions .    for instance , may be , the experimental mobility distribution found in work @xcite ( which stimulated the present work )",
    "should be assigned not to spatial inhomogeneities but to temporal mobility fluctuations of charge carriers ( otherwise , why this distribution so strongly resembles the picture in fig.4 ? ) .",
    "analogously , the large width and asymmetry of mobility distributions of ions in air measured in @xcite can be manifestation of flicker fluctuations in ions mobilities .    at the same time , undoubtedly , our theoretical gallery does not include specific pictures of pronounced `` dispersive transport '' .",
    "this means merely that 1/f - noise under dispersive transport has more rich scaling properties and hence more complicated mobility statistics than what was considered ; developing of theory of such 1/f - noise from rigorous statistical mechanics , instead of probabilistic `` scientific fiction '' , is interesting task for the future .",
