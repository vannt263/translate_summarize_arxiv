    "inflation is now a standard paradigm for describing the physics of the very early universe , but the microphysics nature of the field(s ) responsible for inflation remains unknown . in the last few decades intensive effort",
    "has been devoted to understanding the fundamental physics of the inflation theory . for simplicity ,",
    "most of studies have been focused on the effective single scalar field model , however , in the low - energy limit of string theory , more than one scalar fields are present and they may work cooperatively to drive the inflation , such as the assisted inflation @xcite .",
    "recently , dimopoulos _ et  al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the many axion fields predicted by string vacua can be combined and lead to a radiatively stable inflation , called n - flation . using the random matrix theory easther and",
    "mcallister @xcite showed that the mass distribution for @xmath7 axion fields should be in the marcnko - pastur spectrum form .",
    "further , many cosmological observable imprints of n - flation have been investigated , such as the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath8 @xcite , the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath9 @xcite , and the scalar spectral index @xmath4 @xcite for the pure adiabatic perturbation .",
    "the results show that for @xmath8 and @xmath10 the deviations from the single - field models are negligible , however , the spectral index @xmath4 is smaller than the case of the single - field models .",
    "the preheating process after n - flation is numerically investigated in @xcite and the results show that the parametric resonance is suppressed which differs significantly from the single - field case .",
    "compared with the single field model , the presence of multiple fields during inflation can lead to quite different inflationary dynamics @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "in particular , multiple fields can lead to the generation of entropy ( non - adiabatic ) perturbations during inflation , which can alter the evolution of the overall curvature perturbation @xcite and produce a detectable non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "for a two - field model the entropy perturbations are investigated both analytically and numerically @xcite , however , the generalization from the two - field model to the model with a large number of fields is less developed .",
    "for the n - flation model the entropy perturbations have been investigated by different approaches @xcite . by virtue of the @xmath0 formalism @xcite , an analytic form of spectral index",
    "is derived in @xcite , and similar result is obtained by the authors of @xcite by using a different approach @xcite . in this paper , using the new interpretations of the @xmath0 formalism which are developed in @xcite , we calculate the entropy corrections to the power spectrum of the overall curvature perturbation , corresponding spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "our numerical results are in agreement with the earlier results in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ nflation ] we briefly review the constructions of n - flation and the mass distribution of @xmath7 axion fields , then investigate the cosmological background evolutions numerically . in sec .",
    "[ linear ] we study the linear perturbation , derive explicitly the entropy corrections to the primordial power spectrum , and then calculate the power spectrum , spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio numerically for the n - flation model . sec .",
    "[ concl ] is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly review the construction of n - flation , especially focus on the quadratic potential and the mass spectrum .",
    "then we investigate the cosmological background dynamics with a given mass distribution .",
    "dimpopoulos @xmath11 in  @xcite consider a potential of @xmath7 axions as [ periodic potential ] v(_1,_2,,_n)=_i=1^nv_i(_i)=_i=1^n ^4_i(1-()).where @xmath12 is the periodic potential which arises solely from non - perturbative effects , @xmath13 is the axion decay constant and @xmath14 is the dynamically generated scale of the axion potential that typically arises from an instanton expansion .",
    "this scale can be many orders of magnitude smaller than the planck scale .    for small field values",
    "@xmath15 the periodic potentials can be taylor expanded as [ taylor exp ] v_i(_i)m_i^2_i^2+,with the masses @xmath16 . consider the case in which the masses @xmath17 are distributed uniformly and the axion fields start out displaced from the minimum by @xmath18 , with the maximum displacement set by each axion decay constant _ i^2,then it is effectively equivalent to the scenario of a single field @xmath19 with a super - planckian displacement @xmath20 .",
    "this means that the typical initial condition in the large @xmath7 limit is expected to be super - planckian and it is suitable for chaotic inflation . in this sense ,",
    "n - flation realizes the @xmath21 inflation in a very well - controlled string theory setting .",
    "the authors of @xcite assume a uniform axion mass spectrum for simplicity , however , for a realistic model we should exactly determine which sorts of mass spectra are possible in string compactification .",
    "surprisingly , in the @xmath22 limit , using the random matrix theory easther and mcallister @xcite obtained an essentially universal mass spectrum , without invoking details of the compactification , such as the intersection numbers , the choice of fluxes , or the location in moduli space .",
    "consider the lagrangian of axions with kinetic and potential terms as [ lag1 ] = m_pl^2k_ij_^i^^j - v , where the supergravity potential and the kklt superpotential reads  @xcite [ sg ] v&=&()(k^abd_awd_|b|w-3 ) , + [ kklt ] w&=&w_0(s,_a)+_ia_i(_a)\\{-a_i(_i - i_i)},with @xmath23 run over the dilaton @xmath24 , the complex structure moduli @xmath25 , and the khler moduli @xmath26 . inserting ( [ kklt ] ) into ( [ sg ] ) , expanding the potential around the origin @xmath27 , and using the f - flatness conditions @xmath28 , we have v=(2)^2_ij^i^j+,where the mass matrix is  , @xmath26 , which appear in @xmath29 , are not dynamical variables . ] [ mass matrix ] m_ij = e^k(k^abd_ac_id_bc_j-3c_ic_j ) . from ( [ lag1 ] ) and ( [ mass matrix ] )",
    ", it is easy to see that the kinetic terms and the mass matrix are obviously not diagonal in the basis where the superpotential is simple .",
    "we now perform two orthogonal rotations to diagonalize @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "first , we rotate the basis to make the axion kinetic terms be canonical [ lag2 ] = _ _ i^^i - m_ij^i^j , where the mass matrix becomes [ mass matrix2 ] m_ij=(2)^2o_i^m(d_ac_md^ac_l-3c_mc_l)o_j^l.we perform the second orthogonal rotation so that @xmath32 is diagonalized , because the potential simply takes a purely quadratic form . in order to reach a more clear result , it is helpful to introduce a new @xmath33 rectangular matrix [ r_ai ] r_ai2e^k/2f_i^-1o_i^j(d_aw_j),then the mass matrix @xmath32 becomes [ mass matrix3 ] m_ij = r_iar _  j^a.because we do not know about the individual terms @xmath34 , in what follows we will regard them as random variables , i.e. , we take @xmath32 as a random matrix . now",
    "the task is to determine the eigenvalue spectra of the @xmath35 random matrix .",
    "surprisingly , with the random matrix theory , authors of @xcite find that in the large @xmath7 limit the mass spectrum is independent of concrete values of @xmath34 and then obtain an essentially universal mass spectrum [ mp ] p(m^2)=,for @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the ratio of the dimensions of the rectangular matrix @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the variance of the entries of @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath42 are defined as a&=&^2(1-)^2 , + b&=&^2(1+)^2 .",
    "the spectrum ( [ mp ] ) is nothing , but the marcnko - pastur ( mp ) spectrum .",
    "the normalized mp spectrum ( [ mp ] ) describes the mass distribution probability of a single axion field . on the other hand",
    ", the law of large numbers ensures that the mass distribution of @xmath7 axion fields obeys the distribution probability of the single field . in practice",
    "we uniformly split the mass range of @xmath7 axions @xmath43 into @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) bins [ bins](m_0 ^ 2,m_1 ^ 2),(m_1 ^ 2,m_2 ^ 2 ) , , ( m_n-1 ^ 2,m_n^2),where @xmath46 and the width of each bin @xmath47 are m_0 ^ 2=a , m_n^2=b , m_i^2=m_i-1 ^ 2 + , = ( m_n^2-m_0 ^ 2)/n .",
    "furthermore we set the masses of the axions in each bin as [ binmass]m_i^2=(m_i-1 ^ 2+m_i^2)/2,i=1,2,,n.due to the law of large numbers we then have the following relation [ large number]=p(m_i^2),where @xmath48 denotes the number of axions in the @xmath49th bin .",
    "note that the constraint from the renormalization of newton s constant requires @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath51  @xcite , in this paper we therefore focus on the model with @xmath52 . by introducing a convenient dimensionless mass parameter @xmath53 and corresponding mass spectrum @xmath54",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ mass ] the mass distribution of @xmath55 axion fields in the case of @xmath52 .",
    "the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 are defined as & & x_i , , + [ red mp]&&p(x)ap(m^2)= , 1<x<,with @xmath56 .      in the previous subsection",
    "we have obtained the mass spectrum for the @xmath7 axion fields by virtue of the random matrix theory .",
    "now we discuss the cosmological background dynamics with the mp spectrum . in a flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe ,",
    "the background dynamics is described by the set of equations [ eom1 ] _",
    "i(_i^2+m_i^2_i^2)&=&h^2 , + [ eom2 ] _",
    "i_i^2&=&-h , + [ eom3 ] _",

    ", we can deal with the masse distribution of axions by employing the mp spectrum .",
    "consequently , the summation over @xmath49 in the equations ( [ eom1 ] ) and ( [ eom2 ] ) becomes integrals over mass as [ eom4 ] h^2&=&_a^bp(m^2)dm^2 , + [ eom5 ] h&=&-_a^b^2(t , m^2)p(m^2)dm^2.in principle one can solve the evolution equations ( [ eom3 ] ) , ( [ eom4 ] ) and ( [ eom5 ] ) for one of the @xmath7 fields , such as the lightest field , then use the scaling solution ( [ sr solution ] ) to get the solutions for other @xmath59 fields during the slow roll period . because of the complication of the mp spectrum @xmath60 , however , it is very difficult to perform the integration analytically . in this paper",
    "we solve the set of background equations ( [ eom1 ] ) and ( [ eom3 ] ) numerically ( see fig .  [ evolution ] ) , in which we consider @xmath55 axion fields evolving from the equal - energy initial configurations @xmath61 with the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the lightest field , @xmath62 , at the initial time @xmath58 .",
    "our results show that at the initial stage of inflation , only the heaviest fields ( such as @xmath63 ) begin rolling down the potential , after a hubble time , the heaviest fields are no longer over - damped .",
    "instead of immediately becoming under - damped and oscillating they remain critically damped due to the existence of the lighter fields , and the potential energy of the heavier fields is dissipated away before it is converted into kinetic energy . as a result , inflation is mainly sustained by the lighter fields at the late time and ends till the lightest field is no longer over - damped .",
    "in this section using the @xmath0 formalism , we investigate the entropy perturbations during inflation at the linear perturbation level . in the linear cosmological perturbation theory the scalar perturbations of spacetime",
    "are usually parameterized as [ metric ] ds^2=-(1 + 2)dt^2 + 2a_ibdtdx^i+a^2dx^idx^j , where @xmath41 is the scale factor , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are four scalar perturbations .",
    "one can define two important gauge invariant quantities as [ gaug inv]=--h , q_i=_i+.in the following subsections we first review the @xmath0 formalism and then analyze the entropy perturbations during inflation by using the method proposed by tye , xu and zhang in @xcite , and finally calculate the power spectrum , spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio numerically .",
    "the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath69 on large scales can be usually calculated by use of the @xmath0 formalism @xcite .",
    "( for a multi - field inflation model the @xmath0 formalism is nicely reviewed in @xcite . ) one of the essential assumptions of the @xmath0 formalism is the `` separate universe assumption '' @xcite , in which separate hubble volume evolves like separate friedmann - robertson - walker universe where density and pressure may take different values , but are locally homogeneous .",
    "due to the different e - folding numbers between separate hubble patches , the large scale curvature perturbation @xmath69 on the uniform energy density slice can be expressed as the e - folding number difference between the uniform energy density slice and the unperturbed spatially flat slice at the end of inflation [ dn1 ] ( t_e,)==n_e(_i(t_,),t_e)-n_e^f , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the number of e - folds on the uniform energy density slice and spatially flat slice respectively .",

    "<S> it turns out that the entropy perturbations can not be neglected in n - flation , because the amplitude of entropy components is approximately in the same order as the adiabatic one at the end of inflation @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral index @xmath4 is calculated and it becomes smaller after the entropy modes are taken into account , i.e. , the spectrum becomes redder , compared to the pure adiabatic case . </S>",
