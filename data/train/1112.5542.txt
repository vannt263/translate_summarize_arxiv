    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) aims at establishing a secret key between two parties alice and bob , who are connected via a quantum channel and an authenticated classical channel . in the last few years , in addition to the studies of asymptotic qkd ( i.e. the unrealistic case of infinitely many signals , which is more accessible theoretically ) , more realistic qkd scenarios have been analyzed , where the number of signals sent through the channel is finite @xcite .",
    "a general aim in studies of security in qkd is to determine a scenario in which the secure key rate is as high as possible .",
    "it has been shown that pre - processing methods @xcite , like for example adding classical noise @xcite or advantage distillation @xcite can increase the secure key rate significantly . note that those investigations have focused on pre - processing operating on the _ classical _ level . by the addition of _ quantum noise _ a beneficial effect in asymptotic qkd ( on the level of mutual information ) has been shown in @xcite for the six - state protocol @xcite . however , for a finite number of signals the mutual information of alice and bob versus the one of the eavesdropper eve is not a direct indicator for the secret key rate .    the purpose of this article is to investigate the effect of _ quantum _ noise on secret key rates with _",
    "resources for the bb@xmath1 @xcite and six - state protocol @xcite .",
    "we will analyse our results for two complementary interpretations : first , we present different quantum noise scenarios , where the noise is added on purpose , and investigate its benefit for the secret key rate .",
    "second , we interpret the added noise as the unavoidable noise introduced by a real channel .",
    "we then show how the secret key rate can be improved if we consider the noise introduced by the channel as not fully due to the interaction of an eavesdropper .",
    "we compare the results to the known effect of classical noise and the case of infinitely many signals .",
    "for the investigation we consider the bb@xmath1 and six - state protocol in the entanglement - based scheme under the assumption of collective attacks .",
    "we use the asymptotic equipartition property ( aep ) @xcite to bound the smooth min - entropy @xcite in the high - dimensional hilbert space , such that the @xmath0-secure key rate can be mainly determined by the conditional von neumann entropy of a single - signal - state .",
    "note that here , for key rates in the finite regime , the assumption of collective attacks is necessary , since the equivalence of collective and coherent attacks for the bb@xmath1 and the six - state protocol has so far been proven only in the limit of infinitely many signals @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in we introduce the general framework and fix the notation .",
    "the different noise scenarios are presented and discussed in .",
    "deals with the calculation and optimization of @xmath0-secure key rates for these different noise scenarios .",
    "the results are given in , followed by a conclusion in .",
    "in the following we consider the bb@xmath1 and six - state protocol in the entanglement - based scheme , where the eavesdropper eve can only interact with the signals ( labeled by @xmath2 ) which are sent through the quantum channel .",
    "the most general unitary interaction @xmath3 that eve can perform is given by @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is eve s initial state and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 refer to her @xmath10-dimensional states after the transformation .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 $ ] corresponds to the disturbance , i.e. the quantum bit error rate ( @xmath12 ) introduced by eve if the quantum channel is otherwise noiseless .    throughout our paper",
    "we will study quantum noise which is given by a depolarizing channel .",
    "( note that our calculations could in principle be generalized to other models for quantum noise , but the lower the symmetry of the channel , the more involved the calculations will be . )",
    "the action of the depolarizing channel is described by the map @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the noise parameter .",

    "[ defi : classnoise ] the action of a classical noisy channel is given by @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "note that this definition is different from the usual definition of classical noise in the literature : throughout our paper the probability to flip a bit is called @xmath23 instead of @xmath14 .",
    "this choice of @xmath14 allows a fair comparison of the two different noise models ( quantum versus classical ) for the same parameter @xmath14 , ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "our central figure of merit is the @xmath0-secure key rate for a finite number of signals .",
    "we will use this quantity in the following to compare different noise scenarios .",
    "the @xmath0-secure key rate is calculated for a typical protocol that consists of the procedures state distribution , measurement , sifting , parameter estimation ( pe ) , one - way error correction ( ec ) and privacy amplification ( pa ) .",
    "let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be the probability of failure for the protocol steps parameter estimation , error correction and privacy amplification , respectively . then with a smoothing parameter @xmath28 we can bound the total security of the protocol by @xmath29 for such a protocol it has been shown in @xcite that the rate of an @xmath30-secure key is given by @xmath31 where the smooth min - entropy @xcite @xmath32 is defined as an optimization of the min - entropy @xmath33 over an @xmath0-environment given by @xmath34 with the @xmath25-norm @xmath35 . here",

    "it quantifies eve s uncertainty of alice s and bob s perfectly correlated bitstring .",

    "@xmath41 denotes the conditional shannon entropy @xmath42 with @xmath43 . for simplicity",
    "we consider an ideal error correction protocol , i.e. @xmath44 . the minimization of the smooth min - entropy is due to parameter estimation , where we only except qubit - states @xmath45 which are contained in the set @xcite @xmath46 with @xmath47 where @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) denotes the measurement statistics due to an @xmath50 ( @xmath51)-fold independent application of a measurement .    under the assumption of collective attacks ,",
    "i.e. @xmath52 we can use the aep @xcite @xmath53 to bound the smooth min - entropy for product states @xmath54 by the conditional von neumann entropy of a single copy @xmath55 which is defined as @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "finally , this leads to @xmath58",
    "in this section we present four different noise scenarios which we will investigate in the following . initially , if no noise is present , alice holds one part of the bell - state @xmath59 , with @xmath60 and sends the second part to bob , while the eavesdropper can perform a unitary interaction @xmath3 characterized by a disturbance @xmath61 ( see ) on it .",
    "let us denote the map that corresponds to the unitary interaction @xmath3 as @xmath62 .",
    "the total state after the action of @xmath62 is then given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes eve s initial state .",
    "now , four different noise scenarios are considered :    1 .",
    "alice adds depolarizing quantum noise with noise parameter @xmath65 to her part of the bell - state and sends the other part to bob ( see ) .",
    "this leads to the state @xmath66 note that there is obviously no difference between adding alice s noise before or after eve s interaction , since they act on different hilbert spaces .",
    "2 .   alice adds depolarizing noise with noise parameter @xmath67 to bob s part of the bell - state and sends it to bob ( see ) .",
    "this leads to the state @xmath68 3 .",
    "bob adds depolarizing noise with noise parameter @xmath69 to his part of the bell - state after eve s interaction ( see ) .",
    "this leads to the state @xmath70 4 .",
    "alice introduces classical noise with noise parameter @xmath71 to her classical bit string after her measurement ( see ) .    how do these four scenarios compare , when evaluating the @xmath0-secure key rate ?    ; alice adds depolarizing quantum noise to her part of the initial state .",

    "the aim of this section is to investigate the effect of the various noise scenarios explained in the previous section on the finite @xmath0-secure key rate @xmath72 in .    from the fact that alice and bob share in the beginning a maximally entangled state ( see ) we know that the action of a depolarizing channel on alice s part or on bob s part results in the same total state .",
    "this implies that the states @xmath73 and @xmath74 are identical for @xmath75 and the noise scenarios @xmath25 and @xmath76 are equivalent .    additionally , we now show the equivalence of noise scenario @xmath25 and @xmath10 , i.e. adding rotationally invariant quantum noise is equivalent to adding classical noise .",
    "let us assume for noise scenario @xmath10 that we add classical noise with probability @xmath77 to flip a bit ( see definition  [ defi : classnoise ] ) to a bit - string resulting from measurements in the @xmath78-basis . in noise scenario @xmath25 only the pauli - operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 from the depolarizing channel ( see definition  [ defi : deponoise ] ) lead to a bit - flip , such that the total probability to flip a bit is given by @xmath81 .",
    "note that for the cases in scenario @xmath10 that the bit - strings were obtained by measurements in @xmath82 ( @xmath83)-basis the same argument holds . then only @xmath80 and @xmath84 ( @xmath79 and @xmath84 ) lead to bit - flips in scenario @xmath25 , and due to the symmetry of the depolarizing channel the probability to flip is also @xmath85 in both cases .",
    "this implies the equivalence of scenario @xmath25 and scenario @xmath10 for @xmath86 .",
    "noise scenario @xmath87 will not lead to any benefit for the key rate as it only increases the quantum bit error rate ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this asymmetry between noise scenario @xmath76 and @xmath87 is due to the underlying one - way error - correction protocol , such that adding bob s noise after eve s interaction only influences the key rate @xmath72 by increasing @xmath41 .",
    "the equivalence of the noise scenarios 1 , 2 and 4 , together with the fact that scenario 3 can only be detrimental for the secret key rate , enable us to focus for the rest of this paper on a specific noise scenario , namely noise scenario @xmath25 .",
    "we start for simplicity with the investigation of the asymptotic key rate ( i.e. for @xmath88 ) given by @xcite @xmath89 later , the effect of noise on the finite key rate ( see ) follows by including the finite - size effects .    in order to determine eve s unknown probes in the state @xmath73 , given in eq .",
    "( [ rhoabc ] ) , namely @xmath90 , we expand each probe in basis vectors @xmath91 with the normalization condition @xmath92 and a similar parametrization for @xmath93 , with indices @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "a partial - trace operation on @xmath73 over eve s part leads to the state @xmath95 , which corresponds to the state shared by alice and bob after eve s unitary interaction .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the bb@xmath1 and the six - state protocol permit to characterize the state @xmath95 as bell - diagonal , parametrized by the quantum bit error rate @xmath96 .",

    "we can choose @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "it follows that @xmath106 by using we eliminate @xmath107 , such that with the constraints in the state @xmath73 contains only one unknown parameter , namely @xmath108 .",

    "the unknown parameter @xmath108 ( @xmath114 ) for the six - state protocol ( bb@xmath1 protocol ) has to be chosen in such a way that it minimizes the asymptotic key rate in , such that these states realize eve s best strategy . after including the finite - key corrections ( ) into the optimization",
    ", the key rate is now fully determined by the noise parameter @xmath65 and the disturbance @xmath61 , such that the effects of noise can be calculated , also in the regime of a finite number of signals .",
    "in this section we present our results on the secret key rate in the noisy scenario described above .",
    "we will discuss two possible interpretations of our results : in subsection [ delinoise ] we consider the case that the noise is introduced deliberately by alice .",
    "in subsection [ channelnoise ] we analyse the case where the noise is given by the channel and did not originate from the eavesdropper .",
    "the finite - key rate @xmath72 ( ) will be calculated in both cases for a total security parameter of @xmath117 .",
    "the results are obtained from a numerical optimization procedure , which maximizes the key rate with respect to the parameters @xmath118 , while minimizing with respect to the parameters @xmath108 ( @xmath114 ) , for the six - state ( bb@xmath1 ) protocol .      in the following we illustrate the effect of deliberately added noise ( see ) on the finite key rate @xmath72 ( see ) .    in the behaviour of @xmath119 ,",
    "the minimal number of signals that is needed to extract a non - zero key , with respect to the disturbance @xmath61 is shown for an optimal noise parameter @xmath65 ( see ) for the bb@xmath1 and the six - state protocol . in comparison to the noiseless case",

    "it turns out that the optimal noise parameter @xmath65 for the finite case is always higher than the one for the asymptotic case .",
    "in particular , for the asymptotic key rate the optimal @xmath65 becomes non - zero for around @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) for the six - state ( bb@xmath1 ) protocol , while the benefit for the threshold @xmath119 in the finite scenario appears already for disturbances around @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) for the six - state ( bb@xmath1 ) protocol .     to extract a non - zero key ( @xmath117 ) versus the qber @xmath61 introduced by eve for the bb@xmath1 ( circles ( black ) ) and the six - state protocol ( squares ( red ) ) ; straight line : noise scenario @xmath25 ( see ) , dashed line : no noise.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     ( straight lines ) for the finite - key rate ( ) and the one that maximizes the asymptotic key rate ( ) ( dashed lines ) versus the qber @xmath61 introduced by eve for noise scenario @xmath25 ( see ) ; circles ( black ) : bb@xmath1 , squares ( red ) : six - state.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in we show the optimal secret key rate @xmath72 as a function of the number of signals @xmath131 for a fixed disturbance @xmath121 for the bb@xmath1 protocol and @xmath120 for the six - state protocol , and compare it to the case without added noise .",
    "we obtain that the effect of noise on the finite - key rate is more beneficial than the effect on the asymptotic key rate , when taking the relative increase of the key rate as figure of merit .",
    "for example , for @xmath132 signals we have an increase of @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) in the key rate , whereas the benefit for @xmath135 is only about @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) for the bb@xmath1 ( six - state ) protocol .     for a fixed disturbance @xmath61 for the bb@xmath1 protocol ( @xmath121 ) ( circles ( black ) ) and the six - state protocol ( @xmath120 ) ( squares ( red ) ) ; straight line : noise scenario @xmath25 ( see ) for optimal noise parameter , dashed line : no noise .",

    "in contrast to adding noise deliberately the number @xmath67 can be interpreted as the amount of noise that is introduced by the used quantum channel , which is unavoidable in real qkd settings , and not necessarily dedicated to the eavesdropper .",
    "this interpretation describes the situation in real experiments , where the assumption of unconditional security , i.e. all errors introduced by the channel have to be attributed to the eavesdropper , is over - pessimistic @xcite .",

    "fact into account leads to remarkably higher key rates , as shown in .",
    "for example , for @xmath132 signals , without added noise the key rate in the six - state ( bb@xmath1 ) protocol is @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) , while for channel noise of @xmath141 it is @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) for the six - state ( bb@xmath1 ) protocol .    ) versus number of signals @xmath131 for various noise parameters @xmath67 with @xmath144 for the bb@xmath1 ( circles ( black ) ) and the six - state protocol ( squares ( red ) ) ; dashed lines : @xmath145 , straight lines : @xmath146.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this article we have shown that the presence of quantum noise can improve secret key rates , in particular in the realistic scenario of a finite number of resources .",
    "we have investigated the effect of different noise scenarios on an @xmath0-secure key rate for the bb@xmath1 and the six - state protocol in the entanglement - based scheme , for a finite number of signals .",
    "our results can be interpreted in two ways : first , when taking the view that noise is added deliberately , it turns out that the effect of adding depolarizing noise to the state ( before the state transmisson ) is equal to the benefit gained by adding classical noise , i.e. when alice performs probabilistic bit - flips on her measured bit string .",
    "we obtain that for both the bb@xmath1 and the six - state protocol the benefit ( concerning the key rate ) of adding noise is higher in the regime of a finite number of signals than for the asymptotic key rate .",
    "second , under the realistic assumption that a channel itself introduces noise unavoidably , i.e. the noise is not necessarily created by the eavesdropper , the secret key rate increases significantly with respect to the  worst case  , where all noise is attributed to eve s intervention .",
    "this improvement comes from the fact that the errors from the quantum channel do not give eve information about the key .",
    "this approach avoids the over - pessimistic assumption of unconditional security , and is thus meaningful for realistic experiments .",
