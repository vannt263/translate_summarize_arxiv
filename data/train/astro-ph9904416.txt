    "stecker and de jager @xcite ( hereafter sd98 ) have recalculated the absorption coefficient of intergalactic space using a new , empirically based calculation of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of intergalactic low energy photons by malkan and stecker @xcite ( hereafter ms98 ) obtained by integrating luminosity dependent infrared spectra of galaxies over their luminosity and redshift distributions . after giving their results on the  optical depth as a function of energy and redshift out to a redshift of 0.3 , sd98 applied their calculations by comparing their results with the spectral data on mrk 421 @xcite and spectral data on mrk 501 @xcite .",

    "this agreement is illustrated in figure [ irdata ] which shows the upper sed curve from ms98 in comparison with various data and limits .",
    "the sd98 results for the absorption coefficient as a function of energy do not differ dramatically from those obtained previously @xcite , @xcite ; however , they are more reliable because they are based on the empirically derived iirf given by ms98 , whereas all previous calculations of tev @xmath1-ray absorption were based on theoretical modeling of the iirf .",
    "the ms98 calculation was based on data from nearly 3000 iras galaxies .",
    "these data included ( 1 ) the luminosity dependent infrared seds of galaxies , ( 2 ) the 60@xmath13 m luminosity function of galaxies and , ( 3 ) the redshift distribution of galaxies .",
    "= 4.0 truein    the advantage of using empirical data to construct the sed of the iirf , as done in ms98 , is particularly indicated in the mid - ir range where galaxy observations indicate more flux from warm dust in galaxies than that taken account of in more theoretically oriented models . as a consequence , the mid - ir `` valley '' between the cold dust peak in the far ir and cool star peak in the near ir",
    "is partially filled in ( see figure [ irdata ] ) . for a source at low redshift , it follows from eq .",

    "significant lower limits now exist which are near the predicted iirf flux ( see figure [ irdata ] ) .",
    "in fact , the observed flaring spectrum of mrk 501 has been newly extended to an energy of 24 tev by observations of the _ hegra _ group @xcite .",

    "figure [ hegra ] , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , clearly shows this . the philosophy behind ref .",
    "@xcite is that the existing lower limits on the mid - ir background flux predict a minimum expected absorption .",
    "the derived unabsorbed source spectrum then tells us ( 1 ) that there is negligible intrinsic absorption in the source , and ( 2 ) the physics of the emission mechanism should give a power - law spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath142 up to an energy of at least @xmath14 20 tev .",
    "consider the source pks 2155 - 304 , an xbl located at a moderate redshift of 0.117 , which has been reported by the durham group to have a flux above 0.3 tev of @xmath16 @xmath17 s@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we predict that this source should have its spectrum steepened by @xmath14 1 in its spectral index between @xmath19 and @xmath20 tev and should show an absorption turnover above @xmath21 tev as shown in figure [ 2155 ] .",
    "observations of the spectrum of this source should provide a further test for intergalactic absorption .",
    "in order to calculate high - redshift absorption properly , it is necessary to determine the spectral distribution of the intergalactic low energy photon background radiation as a function of redshift as realistically as possible out to frequncies beyond the lyman limit .",
    "this calculation , in turn , requires observationally based information on the evolution of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of ir through uv starlight from galaxies , particularly at high redshifts .",
    "salamon and stecker @xcite ( hereafter ss98 ) have calculated the  opacity as a function of both energy and redshift for redshifts as high as 3 by taking account of the evolution of both the stellar population spectra and emissivity of galaxies with redshift . in order to accomplish this",
    ", they adopted the recent analysis of fall ,   @xcite and also included the effects of metallicity evolution on galactic stellar population spectra .",
    "they then gave predicted  spectra for selected blazars and extend our calculations of the extragalactic  background from blazars to an energy of 500 gev with absorption effects included .",
    "= 4.0 truein    = 3.0 truein    fall , @xcite have devised a method for calculating stellar emissivity which bypasses the uncertainties associated with estimates of poorly defined luminosity distributions of evolving galaxies .",
    "the core idea of their approach is to relate the star formation rate directly to the evolution of the neutral gas density in damped  systems , and then to use stellar population synthesis models to estimate the mean co - moving stellar emissivity @xmath22 of the universe as a function of frequency @xmath23 and redshift @xmath24 .",
    "the ss98 calculation of stellar emissivity closely follows this elegant analysis , with minor modifications .",
    "ss98 also obtained metallicity correction factors for stellar radiation at various wavelengths .",
    "decreased metallicity at high redshifts gives a bluer stellar population spectrum @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the weak redshift dependence of the opacity at the higher redshifts as shown in figure  [ opac ] indicates that the opacity is not very sensitive to the initial epoch of galaxy formation , @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , the uncertainty in the metallicity correction ( see figure [ opac ] ) would obscure any dependence on @xmath38 even further .",

    "as an example , if one adopts the opacity results which include the metallicity correction , the highest energy photon in this burst would be constrained probably to have originated at a redshift less than @xmath142 .",
    "future detectors such as _ glast _ ref .",
    "@xcite , may be able to place better redshift constraints on bursts observed at higher energies .",
    "such constraints may further help to identify the host galaxies of bursts .    observed cutoffs in grazar spectra may be intrinsic cutoffs in  production in the source , or may be caused by intrinsic  absorption within the source itself .",
