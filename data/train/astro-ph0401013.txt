    "it is important to extend the study of quasars to high redshifts in order to understand the evolution of quasars and their environments .",
    "one of the main results of recent studies of quasar evolution is that the quasar luminosity function evolves strongly with redshift .",
    "( e.g. boyle et  al .",
    "many studies of quasar evolution are aimed at explaining this luminosity evolution .",
    "the x - ray band probes the innermost regions of the central engine of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "the study of agn in x - rays may possibly answer the question of whether there is an evolution in their central engines and how this is related to the evolution of the quasar luminosity function .",
    "the observed x - ray continuum emission of agn is generally modeled by a power law of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of photons per unit energy interval .",
    "extensive studies of agn during the past decade indicate that this power - law component is produced by compton scattering of soft photons by hot electrons in a corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the study of this power - law component , its correlations with other agn parameters , and its evolution reveals important information on the accretion process of the central object .",
    "the x - ray photon indices of low - redshift radio - quiet quasars are measured to have mean values of @xmath72.62.7 in the _ rosat _  soft x - ray band @xcite and @xmath71.92.0 for the _ asca _  hard x - ray band @xcite , and are correlated with the @xmath8 fwhm @xcite .",
    "there is no strong evidence that the x - ray power - law index evolves with redshift or correlates with x - ray luminosity to date @xcite .",
    "another important parameter that describes the broad band spectral shape of quasars is the optical - to - x - ray spectral index , quantified as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the flux densities at 2 kev and 2500    in the quasar rest - frame , respectively .",
    "recently , several studies have provided estimates of @xmath12  for very high redshift ( @xmath13 ) quasars @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath12  is mainly dependent on the ultra - violet luminosity while @xcite found that @xmath12  primarily evolves with redshift .",
    "in addition to spectral studies , variability studies of seyfert galaxies show that the variability amplitude ( excess variance ) is anti - correlated with x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "variability studies have been extended to quasars by several groups @xcite .",
    "low redshift quasars ( @xmath14 ) are found to have an excess variance consistent with the luminosity relation found in seyfert 1s and there is a possible upturn of x - ray variability for high redshift quasars with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it is also important to compare the properties of quasars near the peak of their comoving number density , thought to have occurred at @xmath16 , with low redshift quasars .",
    "this comparison may provide clues as to what caused the dramatic decay of the quasar number density as the universe expanded .",
    "most of the observational and analysis techniques employed to date to study the evolution and emission mechanism of faint , high - redshift quasars are based on either summing the individual spectra of many faint x - ray sources taken from a large and complete sample or obtaining deep x - ray observations of a few quasars . although these techniques may yield important constraints on the average properties of high redshift quasars they each have significant limitations .",
    "gravitational lensing provides an additional method for studying high - redshift quasars .",
    "the extra flux magnification , from a few to @xmath7100 , provided by the lensing effect enables us to obtain high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectra and light - curves of distant quasars with less observing time and allows us to search for changes in quasar spectroscopic properties and x - ray flux variability over three orders of magnitude in intrinsic x - ray luminosity . with the aid of lensing",
    ", we can probe lower flux levels than other flux limited samples with similar instruments and exposures",
    ". this could be an important factor because the x - ray properties of high - redshift , low - luminosity quasars could be different from those of other quasars and by studying them we could possibly obtain information about the evolution of quasars .",
    "similar lensing studies have also been performed in the sub - millimeter and co bands @xcite , which suggested that gravitational lensing could be an efficient method for studying various properties of high - redshift quasars . here",
    "we present the results of an x - ray mini - survey of relatively high redshift gravitationally lensed radio - quiet quasars .",
    "we chose only the radio - quiet quasars in our sample because the powerful relativistic jets in the radio - loud quasars will introduce additional complication when modeling the continuum x - ray emission from the accretion disc .",
    "we use a @xmath17 = 50 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 and @xmath19 cosmology throughout the paper .",
    "our mini - survey contains eleven gravitationally - lensed , radio - quiet quasars with redshifts ranging between 1.695 and 3.911 .",
    "five of them contain broad absorption lines ( bals ) or mini - bals in their rest - frame ultraviolet spectra .",
    "most of the lensed quasars of our sample were observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; garmire et  al .",
    "2003 ) onboard _ chandra _  as part of a guaranteed time observing program ( principal investigator : g. garmire ) .",
    "the data for two of the them were obtained through the public _",
    "chandra _  archive .",
    "several of them were observed twice .",
    "three of the lensed quasars were also observed with _ xmm - newton_. table  [ tab : olog ] presents a log of observations , including redshifts , galactic column densities , and exposure times .",
    "each observation was performed continuously with no interruptions .",
    "all of the sources observed with _",
    "chandra _  were placed near the aim point of the acis - s array , which is on the back - illuminated s3 chip .",
    "all of the data were taken in faint or very faint mode .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "data were reduced with the ciao 2.3 software tools provided by the _ chandra _  x - ray center ( cxc ) following the standard threads on the cxc website . only photons with standard _",
    "grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 were used in the analysis .",
    "we used events in the 0.48 kev energy range in the spectral analysis and events in the 0.210 kev range for the variability studies .",
    "the source events were extracted from circles with radii ranging from 3  to 5  depending on the separations of the lensed images of each quasar .",
    "the circles included all of the lensed images .",
    "background events were extracted from annuli with inner and outer radii of 10  and 30 , respectively , centered on the sources .",
    "we adjusted the inner and outer radii of the background subtraction annuli in some cases to avoid other sources in the field .",
    "the background contributes an insignificant amount to the count rate in a source region , even during a background flare .",
    "the average exposure time for the _",
    "chandra_observations was about 25 ks .",
    "the detected source count rates ranged between 0.0030.08 @xmath20 .",
    "three targets were observed with the european photon imaging camera pn and mos detectors @xcite onboard _ xmm - newton_. the _ xmm - newton _  data were analyzed with the standard analysis software , sas 5.3 .",
    "the tasks ` epchain ` and ` emchain ` from sas were used to reduce the pn and mos data and photons of patterns @xmath21 and @xmath22 were selected from the pn and mos data , respectively .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  data are affected more than the _ chandra _  data by background flares because the point spread function of _ xmm - newton _  is significantly larger than that of _ chandra_-acis .",
    "several strong background flares occurred during the _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "these flares are filtered out in the spetral analysis .",
    "we performed spectral fitting in order to obtain the power - law indices of the x - ray continuum emission components of the quasars in our sample .",
    "the photon indices that we measured were in the observed 0.48 kev energy range .",
    "we used the _ chandra _",
    "data for all of the lensed quasars in the spectral analysis except pg  1115 + 080 , where we used the _ xmm - newton _  data .",
    "rx  j0911.4 + 0551  and apm  08279 + 5255  were also observed with _",
    "xmm - newton_. we did not use these data , however , because there were large amplitude and long duration background flares in the _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "the background flare in the _ xmm - newton _  observation of rx  j0911.4 + 0551  almost spans the entire observation .",
    "the background flare in the _ xmm - newton _  observation of apm  08279 + 5255  occurs during the last @xmath23 ks of the observation .",
    "we filtered the background flare time from this observation and performed a spectral analysis to compare with our _ chandra _  results . for our later correlation analysis , we used the _ chandra _  data of apm  08279 + 5255  to avoid the possible complication from the cross calibration between _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  instruments .",
    "for those sources observed twice with _",
    "chandra _ , we performed simultaneous fits to the spectra extracted from the two observations except in the case of apm  08279 + 5255 , where we used only the second observation because it was much longer than the first one .",
    "we extracted spectra for each quasar using the ciao tool ` psextract ` .",
    "we extracted events from all of the lensed images for each source except for the case of h  1413 + 117 . a possible microlensing event in h  1413",
    "+ 117  appears to amplify and distort the spectrum of image a only and thus affects the spectral slope greatly @xcite . in this case",
    ", we extracted the spectrum of the microlensed image a and the spectrum of the other three images separately . a microlensing event is also detected in q  2237 + 0305 .",
    "however , the spectral shape of the microlensed image a of q  2237 + 0305  is not significantly affected by the microlensing event @xcite .",
    "spectral fitting was performed with ` xspec v11.2 ` @xcite .",
    "there are typically several hundreds ( 1806000 ) detected source events in the spectra of the target quasars , except for the spectrum of he  2149@xmath242745  which has only 23 detected events .",
    "the moderate s / n of our spectra allows us to fit each of them individually using relatively complex models .",
    "thus we can constrain the underlying power - law slopes more accurately than in previous studies of unlensed quasars of similar redshift .",
    "the models we used are listed in column  3 of table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "all spectral models included an underlying power - law model modified by galactic absorption .",
    "the galactic absorbing columns were obtained from @xcite .    to account for the recently observed quantum efficiency decay of acis , possibly caused by molecular contamination of the acis filters ,",
    "we have applied a time - dependent correction to the acis quantum efficiency implemented in the ` xspec ` model ` acisabs1.1 ` .",
    "if the source was a balqso with a medium s / n spectrum , we added a neutral absorption component at the redshift of the source . for high s / n balqso spectra such as pg  1115 + 080  and apm  08279 + 5255  we used the ` absori ` model in ` xspec ` to model the intrinsic absorption component as an ionized absorber @xcite .",
    "we added a neutral absorption component at the redshift of the lens for q  2237 + 0305  @xcite .",
    "for some of the spectra containing emission or absorption line features , we added gaussian line components to model them accordingly .",
    "the spectra of the quasars are displayed in figures  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the spectral fitting results are given in table  [ tab : spec ] . in table  [",
    "tab : spec ] , we also list the observed 0.48 kev fluxes and rest - frame 0.22 kev and 2 - 10 kev luminosities for the lensed quasars in the sample not corrected for the lensing magnification .",
    "the unlensed luminosities are calculated in @xmath25[sec : mag ] .",
    "we have corrected for the various absorption components when calculating x - ray luminosities .",
    "these absorption components include galactic absorption , absorption in the lensing galaxy , intrinsic absorption , and the acis contamination .",
    "the mean photon index of the radio - quiet quasars in our sample is @xmath26 with a dispersion of @xmath27 and the median photon index of the radio - quiet quasars in our sample is 1.86 .",
    "we calculated the optical - to - x - ray power - law slope , @xmath12 , for the quasars in our sample .",
    "the differential magnification between the optical and x - ray band is insignificant because both of the source regions are estimated to be much smaller than the einstein radius .",
    "the rest - frame 2 kev flux densities were calculated from the best - fit models to the spectra of the quasars .",
    "the redshifts of our sample range from 1.7 to 4 , thus the rest - frame 2 kev energy falls in the 0.40.74 kev observed - frame energy range .",
    "we removed all of the absorption components including the intrinsic ones for the balqsos when calculating the rest - frame 2 kev flux densities in order to study the properties of the intrinsic continuum .",
    "the rest - frame 2500  fluxes were obtained from the published optical data in the literature and from current ongoing programs such as the cfa - arizona space telescope lens survey ( castles ) and the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) .",
    "we first converted the optical magnitudes to flux densities at the effective wavelengths of the filters , then extrapolated them to the rest - frame 2500    flux densities .",
    "we used the standard relations between magnitudes and flux densities for the v and r bands . for the f814w magnitudes obtained with the _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 , we used the relation from @xcite to convert between magnitudes and flux densities .",
    "we used @xmath28 in the extrapolation .",
    "typical quasar optical spectral indices are in the -0.5 to -0.9 range @xcite .",
    "we chose the optical magnitudes from the bands closest to the redshifted 2500    wavelength to reduce the error in the extrapolation .",
    "we corrected the galactic extinction based on @xcite .",
    "the extinction induced by the dust from the lensing galaxies is not significant except for q  2237 + 0305 , which is lensed by the central bulge of the galaxy .",
    "we corrected it according to the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12  values are listed in table  [ tab : aox ] .",
    "the listed error - bars of @xmath12  are at the @xmath29 level and account for the uncertainties in the x - ray spectral slope and normalization , the conversion from optical magnitude to flux density and the extrapolation of the optical / uv spectrum .",
    "we note that a source may have varied between the optical and x - ray observations thus leading to systematic errors in our estimates of @xmath12 . for the range of @xmath12  in our sample , a change of optical flux by a factor of two will lead to a change of @xmath30@xmath12@xmath31 .",
    "the rest - frame 2  kev and 2500  flux densities and rest - frame 2500  luminosity densities are also listed in table  [ tab : aox ] .",
    "these values are corrected for lensing magnification as we discuss further in @xmath25[sec : mag ] . in conclusion",
    "we find that the mean @xmath12  value for all the quasars in our sample is @xmath32 ( @xmath33 without he  2149@xmath242745  which has only 23 x - ray events ) with a dispersion of @xmath34 .",
    "we estimated the magnification for each of the lensed systems in order to obtain the unlensed x - ray luminosities of the quasars .",
    "we first searched in the literature for magnifications of well - modeled systems .",
    "however , not all of the systems in our sample have been previously modeled in detail and for some cases the magnification values are not included in the published analysis .",
    "we modeled these systems with the ` gravlens ` 1.04 software tool developed by c. keeton @xcite .",
    "we used a singular isothermal elliptical ( sie ) mass profile with external shear in most cases , and took into account optical image positions and flux ratios obtained from the castles survey .",
    "we assumed a 20% error - bar for the flux ratios to account for uncertainties from microlensing or differences between optical and x - ray flux ratios .",
    "our modeling results are listed in table  [ tab : mag ] .",
    "we compared the magnification values that we obtained with those published in @xcite and found them to be in good agreement .",
    "we note that the magnification values obtained may have large systematic errors because the sie model adopted in this analysis may not be suitable for all the systems .",
    "for example , in pg  1115 + 080 , a set of different mass potentials are used in the modeling of the magnification in @xcite . a magnification range of 2046",
    "was obtained for this system .",
    "based on this example , we adopt a factor of two as a typical systematic uncertainty in the magnification . in @xmath25[sec : disli ] we investigate how this systematic uncertainty could affect for our conclusions via monte carlo simulations .",
    "the light - curves for the _ chandra _  observations of the lensed quasars of our sample are displayed in figure  [ fig : lc ] binned with a bin size of 1000 s ( observed - frame ) .",
    "we show the light - curves of the longer _",
    "chandra _",
    "exposure if two _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations of the same target are available .",
    "we excluded he  2149@xmath242745  in our timing analysis because of its low s / n ( only 23 events ) .    to estimate the relative variability of the light - curves",
    ", we used the normalized excess variance @xcite defined as @xmath35\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the number of bins in the light - curve , @xmath37 are the count rates per bin with error @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the mean count rate .",
    "the error on @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 $ ] , where @xmath42-\\sigma^{2}_{\\rm rms}\\mu^{2}\\}^{2}\\ ] ] this method normalizes the variability amplitude to the flux , thus is less biased towards the low flux light - curves .",
    "it is better to apply this method to a sample of light - curves of similar lengths to avoid possible bias .",
    "for example , it would be easier to detect long time - scale variability from a light - curve with a long duration .",
    "in addition , the bin sizes should be similar in order to compare variability on similar time - scales .",
    "high s / n light - curves are needed for this analysis as the variability could be easily dominated by noise in the low s / n light - curves .",
    "this excess variance method also has some limitations .",
    "one of them is that it is not very sensitive to short flares of moderate amplitude .",
    "the excess variance values for _ chandra _  light - curves with three different bin sizes are listed in table  [ tab : evar ] .",
    "we also calculated the excess variance for the three sources observed with _ xmm - newton _  and the results are listed in table  [ tab : evar2 ] .",
    "the background was subtracted in the calculation .",
    "overall , the error - bars on the excess variance are quite large and in some cases , the values are negative .",
    "therefore , for most quasars we can really only obtain an upper limit on the value of the excess variance .",
    "the unlensed 0.22 kev and 210 kev x - ray luminosities of the lensed quasars in our mini - survey range from @xmath3 to @xmath43  .",
    "the mean spectral index of our sample , 1.78 , is consistent with the value of 1.84 from the recent study of very high redshift quasars @xcite and the value of 1.89 from the radio - quiet _ asca _",
    "sample @xcite , especially when one considers the large dispersion of spectral indices in these studies and our small sample size .",
    "we plot the rest - frame 0.22 kev and 210 kev x - ray luminosity against redshift in figure  [ fig : gamma](a ) , and the photon indices vs. redshift , 0.22 kev luminosity , and 210 kev luminosity in figures  [ fig : gamma](b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , respectively . figures  [ fig : gamma](c ) and ( d ) show a correlation between the spectral indices of our sample of lensed quasars and their x - ray luminosities .",
    "we tested the significance of this correlation using the spearman s rank correlation method .",
    "we obtained a rank correlation coefficient of 0.94 significant at the greater than 99.997% confidence level for the correlation between photon index and 0.22 kev luminosity and a coefficient of 0.71 significant at the 98.6% confidence level for the correlation between photon index and 210 kev luminosity .",
    "we note that the measured rest - frame 0.22 kev luminosity for high redshift quasars obtained from _",
    "chandra _  and",
    "_ xmm - newton _  data is less accurate than the rest - frame 210 kev luminosity because it depends on extrapolation and suffers from the uncertainty in the absorbing columns towards the quasars .",
    "we adopt a significance at the 98.6% confidence level for this correlation , evaluated with the 2 - 10 kev luminosities .",
    "we also tested for a possible correlation between x - ray luminosity and redshift and between photon index and redshift and found none .",
    "the correlation between the photon index and x - ray luminosity was a surprising result .",
    "therefore , we tested if this correlation is driven by certain data points .",
    "excluding one of our data points at a time and performing the spearman s rank correlation between @xmath44 and the 0.22 kev luminosity to the rest of the data set , we find a strong correlation with a significance level greater than 99.98% each time .",
    "we performed a similar analysis with the 210 kev luminosity , and the correlation is significant at the greater than 95% confidence level each time .",
    "this indicates that the correlation is not driven by any particular data point .",
    "we further performed correlation tests by excluding data points with errors in @xmath44 larger than 0.20 .",
    "two data points are excluded and the rest of the data points still show a correlation significant at the greater than 99.98% confidence level .",
    "the significance is at the 92% confidence level when 210 kev luminosities are used .",
    "we also tested if there is a bias from different flux levels in our sample such that quasars with low fluxes have a systematically flatter slope because of measurement errors . in principle , this should not be a problem for the sample in this paper because some low luminosity quasars have high s / n spectra as a result of the gravitational lensing effect . to test this , we simulated spectra with the same photon index ( @xmath45 ) but with a wide range of s / n and then fitted them with the same models within ` xspec ` .",
    "we found that for low s / n spectra , when the total number of photons is less than @xmath7200 , the measured @xmath44 could possibly be flatter by @xmath31 .",
    "this would affect three of our data points : he  2149@xmath242745 , lbqs  1009@xmath240252 , and q  1208 + 101  with ( one low - luminosity and two high - luminosity quasars ) .",
    "we tested this effect by increasing the photon index by 0.1 for these three quasars and performed the correlation test again and found the correlations between @xmath44 and 0.22 kev ( 210 kev ) luminosities are significant at the 99.99% ( 98.7% ) confidence levels , respectively .",
    "a @xmath44@xmath46 correlation has been previously searched for in other samples of radio - quiet quasars .",
    "@xcite reported first a possible correlation between @xmath44 and luminosity with nine radio - quiet quasars observed with _",

    "( including the original nine ) by @xcite .",
    "@xcite also searched for a correlation between @xmath44 and luminosity in another sample of radio - quiet quasars observed with _",

    "we excluded one data point from @xcite with a large measurement error on @xmath44 .",
    "we also excluded phl 5200 from @xcite in our analysis because new _ xmm - newton _  observations of the object showed that most of the x - rays originate from a nearby radio source @xcite .",
    "we corrected the x - ray luminosity of he  1104@xmath241805  reported in @xcite to account for the gravitational lensing magnification of about 12 based on our analysis presented in @xmath25[sec : mag ] .",

    "the @xmath44 dependence on @xmath47 seems to flatten out or even has an anti - correlation pattern .",
    "we performed the spearman s rank correlation test to all of the ( @xmath2 ) quasars and did not find a correlation between @xmath44 and 210 kev luminosity .",
    "we separated the quasars in two groups with luminosities below and above @xmath53 and performed the rank correlation again to each group .",
    "the low luminosity quasars show a strong correlation between @xmath44 and 210 kev luminosity at the 99.97% confidence level and the high luminosity quasars show an anti - correlation between @xmath44 and 210 kev luminosity at the 98.9% confidence level .",
    "we performed a monte - carlo simulation to test how much the @xmath44@xmath47 correlation is affected by the uncertainty of the magnification factors of our lensed quasars .",
    "we used the combined data sets from the lensed sample and from the quasars of @xcite with @xmath2 , which show a strong @xmath44@xmath47 correlation .",
    "we assumed a systematic uncertainty on the magnification of a factor of two ( see discussion in @xmath25[sec : mag ] ) and simulated 10,000 data sets with @xmath47 perturbed from its measured value randomly , within the range of this error - bar .",
    "we fixed the data points from @xcite at their original values .",
    "we performed the spearman s correlation test between @xmath44 and 210 kev luminosity on the simulated data sets and found that the @xmath44@xmath47 correlation in each simulated data set is at least significant at the 98.6% confidence level for 10,000 simulations and 9,888 of them have @xmath44@xmath47 correlations significant at the greater than 99.5% confidence level .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that this correlation is driven by the uncertainties in the magnification factors .",
    "possible errors in magnification factors , the small number of quasars in the present sample combined with the medium s / n of several of the observations may have led to an unaccounted systematic effect .",
    "additional observations of @xmath16 lensed quasars with better s / n and a more detailed modeling of all the lenses in our sample will help confirm this result .",
    "although the @xmath44@xmath47 correlation found in this paper could be a result of selection effect , we discuss possible interpretations of this correlation below .",
    "previous studies did not find any correlation between @xmath44 and @xmath47 in low - redshift quasars and seyfert 1s .",
    "recently , several x - ray monitoring programs of seyfert galaxies have indicated a correlation between x - ray spectral index and 210 kev x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "the spectra of these seyfert galaxies steepen as the x - ray flux increases .",
    "@xcite suggested that variations of several properties of the x - ray emitting corona ( e.g. , electron temperature , optical depth , size ) with the x - ray flux may explain this @xmath44 vs. x - ray - flux relation .",
    "similarly , a @xmath44 vs. x - ray - flux relation also exists in some seyfert 2 and radio - loud objects @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate that although the @xmath44@xmath47 relation does not apply to a sample of low - redshift quasars and seyferts , this relation applies to individual objects .",
    "in contrast to the low - redshift quasars , the @xmath44@xmath47 dependence found at high redshift , especially in high - redshift and low-@xmath47 quasars indicates that these quasars may represent a distinct sub - population of quasars .",
    "it is possible that the properties of the x - ray emitting coronae of the high - redshift quasars are more homogeneous than those in the low - redshift quasars .",
    "we explore two possible interpretations of the correlation between the spectral index and the x - ray luminosity in the context of the model of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our first hypothesis is that there is a narrow range ( of order a few ) of accreting black hole masses at high redshift while the observed range of observed x - ray luminosities ( spanning aproximately two orders of magnitude ) is caused by a large range in the accretion rate , i.e. , a wide range of eddington ratios ( the ratio of the accretion rate to the eddington rate ) .",
    "our second hypothesis is that the opposite is true , namely that the range of accreting black hole masses at high redshift is large ( spanning approximately two orders of magnitude ) , while the eddington rate is fairly constant and close to unity ( i.e. , the accretion rate is always fairly close to the eddington limit , regardless of the mass ) .    in the model of @xcite and @xcite the inner accretion disk",
    "is sandwiched by a hot , tenuous , possibly patchy corona which emits the hard x - ray photons .",
    "the corona cools by inverse compton scattering of soft photons ( @xmath54  ev ) from the underlying disk , which results in the hard x - ray photons that we observe .",
    "@xcite explored how the model predictions change for a wide range of the system parameters , namely the optical depth and temperature of the corona and the temperature of the ( assumed ) black - body spectrum of seed photons . in particular , @xcite found that the 210  kev spectral index is nearly proportional to the optical depth in the hot corona and also decreases as the temperature of seed soft - photon spectrum increases .",
    "moreover , in the case of a `` compact '' corona , i.e. , one in which pair production is high enough that the compton scattering optical depth is dominated by electron - positron pairs , the 210  kev spectral index is nearly proportional to the log of the 210  kev luminosity , just as we have found observationally .    in our first hypothesis the observed range of luminosities is set by the range of accretion rates , with the black hole mass being nearly constant . in this context",
    "the observed correlation might be explained if the optical depth in the hot corona is somehow related to the accretion rate ; for example , the density of the corona could increase with accretion rate and so would the optical depth .",
    "there is a competing effect , however : as the accretion rate decreases so does the temperature of the underlying thin disk , which provides the seed photons , with the result that the spectral index of the emerging x - ray spectrum increases .    in our second hypothesis ,",
    "the accretion rate for all objects is very close to the eddington limit , while the observed range in luminosity is set by a range in black hole masses . in the context of this hypothesis , and under the assumption that the optical depth of the corona is dominated by electron - positron pairs ,",
    "@xcite predict a correlation between the 210  kev spectral index and luminosity just like the one we observe .",
    "the optical depth in this case depends only on the `` compactness '' of the corona , which can be expressed as @xmath55 @xcite , where @xmath56 is the ratio of the x - ray luminosity to the eddington luminosity ( roughly proportional to the eddington ratio ) and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the vertical and radial extent of the corona in units of the schwartzschild radius .",
    "thus , in this scenario , the spectral index could increase if the compactness of the corona increases with black hole mass ( see equation 16 of @xcite ) , with the consequence that the emerging 2 - 10  kev luminosity increases as well .",
    "moreover , as the optical depth reaches unity , the spectral index reaches its maximum value and begins to decline for larger optical depths .",
    "this feature may explain the turnover that we observe in the spectral index @xmath59 luminosity plot of figure  [ fig : gamma1 ] .",
    "we therefore favor this interpretation over the previous one .",
    "this interpretation is also appealing because it is consistent with the predictions of semi - analytic models of @xcite for the cosmological evolution of supermassive black holes and their fueling rates .",
    "in particular , these authors predict that at redshifts between 1.5 and 3 , the fueling rate of supermassive black holes in quasars are within a factor of a few of the eddington limit , while their masses span the range between @xmath60 and @xmath61  m@xmath62 .",
    "@xcite found that the optical - to - x - ray index , @xmath12 , of radio - quiet quasars is mainly dependent on the rest - frame ultra - violet luminosity such that quasars with higher ultra - violet luminosities have steeper @xmath12  values ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "they also do not detect a significant redshift dependence of @xmath12  in their analysis , however , @xcite found that @xmath12  depends primarily on redshift ( @xmath12  steepens with increasing redshift ) and weakly on luminosity .",
    "we compare the average @xmath12 , -1.70 ( -1.66 without he  2149@xmath242745 ) , of our sample with the average @xmath12 , -1.71 , of @xcite , and the @xmath12values are consistent within the observed r.m.s .",
    "the redshift range of our quasars is @xmath0 , lower than the sample of @xmath63 quasars studied in @xcite .",
    "however , the consistency between the @xmath12  values from the lensed sample in this paper and the sample of @xmath63 quasars studied in @xcite does not rule out a possible small evolution of @xmath12  with redshift due to our small sample size .",
    "we plotted the @xmath12  values from our lensed sample against their redshift and rest - frame 2500  luminosity density in figure  [ fig : aox](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "we performed the spearman s rank correlation test between @xmath12  and @xmath64 and between @xmath12  and @xmath65 , but found no significant correlation in either case .",
    "considering the large dispersion of the @xmath12  values from the best fit @xmath12@xmath66 relation of @xcite , it is not surprising that no significant correlation is found in our data set because of the small sample size .",
    "we over - plotted our @xmath12  data on the @xmath12@xmath66 relation of @xcite with a dispersion of 0.25 as indicated by the shaded region in figure  [ fig : aox](b ) , and found that most of our data are consistent with the @xmath12@xmath66 relation except one bal qso data point .",
    "we also searched for possible correlations between the @xmath12  values and other properties of the quasars such as @xmath44 and @xmath47 .",
    "the correlation results were strongly biased by the -2.1 @xmath12  value of he  2149@xmath242745 .",
    "when we removed this data point , no significant correlation was detected .",
    "we used the upper limits of the excess variance obtained from light - curves of bin size 1000 seconds when comparing with results for local seyferts and other high redshift quasars .",
    "this bin size corresponds to rest - frame time scales ranging from 200 to 370 s for the quasars in our sample and is similar to the time scales used in other short time scale variability studies in seyfert galaxies and quasars ( e.g. turner et  al .",
    "we plotted the excess variances of the high redshift lensed quasar sample together with the variances for seyfert 1s @xcite , nls1s @xcite , llagn @xcite , and high redshift ( @xmath15 ) quasars @xcite in figure  [ fig : excess ] .",
    "we fitted the seyfert 1 points with a power law and fixed the power - law index to the same value reported in @xcite , allowing only the normalization parameter to be free .",
    "the power - law relation is shown as a solid line in figure  [ fig : excess ] .",
    "all of the upper limits of the excess variances for the high redshift lensed quasars of this paper are consistent with the seyfert 1 @xmath67@xmath47 correlation .",
    "when we compare the upper limits with the nls1s data , three of the upper limits of our sample are located below the @xmath67@xmath47 relation for nls1s , which have about an order of magnitude larger excess variance than the seyfert 1s .",
    "the consistency between the excess variance upper limits of our lensed sample and the seyfert 1s @xmath67@xmath47 relation does not contradict the possible upturn in the value of the variability of @xmath15 quasars for quasars with luminosities of about @xmath68 as presented by @xcite .",
    "most of the quasars in our sample have redshifts greater than 2 , but the luminosity range of our sample is below the luminosity range of @xcite .",
    "the excess variance analysis that we discuss in this paper probes the shortest time - scale variability of radio - quiet quasars .",
    "there are two main interpretations that have been presented in previous studies to explain the excess variance and luminosity relation .",
    "( e.g. , nandra et  al .",
    "1997 ; manners , almaini , & lawrence 2002 ) .",
    "first , the more luminous sources may be physically large and lack the short time - scale variability .",
    "second , the more luminous sources may contain more independently flaring regions and these flares contribute less to the total flux for the more luminous sources compared with the low luminous sources .",
    "there are several rapid flares observed in our light - curve sample , in particular , such flares were detected in rx  j0911.4 + 0551 , q  2237 + 0305 , and pg  1115 + 080  @xcite .",
    "we performed the kolmogorov - smirnov test to the light - curves of the individual images of the systems , rx  j0911.4 + 0551 , q  2237 + 0305 , and pg  1115 + 080 , and found the light - curves are variable at the 99.8% , 97% , and 99.6% confidence levels , respectively .",
    "these observations support the second explanation where there are also flares in the high luminosity quasars , however , due to the quasar s high luminosity , flares contribute less to the total luminosity and thus luminous quasars have smaller excess variances .",
    "we presented results from a mini - survey of relatively high redshift ( @xmath0 ) gravitationally lensed radio - quiet quasars observed with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _  and _ xmm - newton_. we demonstrated how gravitational lensing can be used to study high - redshift quasars .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "we find a possible correlation between the spectral slope and x - ray luminosity of the gravitationally lensed quasar sample .",
    "the x - ray spectral slope steepens as the x - ray luminosity increases .",
    "the limited number of quasars in the present sample combined with the medium s / n of several of the observations and the systematic uncertainties from the lensing magnification modeling may have led to an unaccounted systematic effect .",
    "additional observations of @xmath16 lensed quasars with better s / n and more detailed modeling of all the lenses in our sample will allow us to confirm this result .",
    "+ such a correlation is not observed in nearby @xmath69 quasars suggesting that quasars at redshifts near the peak of their number density may have different accretion properties than low redshift quasars .",
    "when we combined the data from other samples of radio - quiet quasars selecting quasars with redshift ( @xmath2 ) together with the present lensed sample , the correlation is still significant , especially in the low x - ray luminosity range between @xmath70 .",
    "if this correlation is confirmed by future studies , it could provide significant information on the emission mechanism and evolution of quasars .",
    "+ we suggest that this correlation can be understood if we hypothesize that the quasars in our sample are fueled at rates near their eddington limit ( consistent with recent models for quasar evolution ) and that the optical depth of their x - ray emitting coronae increases with black hole mass .",
    "2 .   we did not find a strong correlation between the optical - to - x - ray spectral index , @xmath12 , on either redshift or on uv luminosity in our small sample .",
    "however , most of our data points are consistent with the @xmath12@xmath66 correlation of @xcite .",
    "our estimated upper limits of x - ray variability of the relatively high redshift lensed quasars sample is consistent with the known correlation observed in seyfert 1s .",
