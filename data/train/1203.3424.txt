    "0.5 in    the e2 type elliptical galaxy ngc 5903 ( @xmath4 ) forms a pair with the e0.5 elliptical galaxy ngc 5898 ( @xmath5 ) ; these two are the dominant members of a compact group that also contains an so type elongated dwarf galaxy eso 514@xmath0g003 ( @xmath6 ; maia , da costa & latham 1989 ; see , also , appleton , pedlar & wikinson 1990 , hereinafter apw90 ) . the group lies at a distance of @xmath7 mpc ( apw90 ; macchetto et al .  1996 ; rickes , pastoriza & bonatto 2008 ; serra & oosterloo 2010 ) , taking a hubble constant of 70 kms@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 .",
    "( komatsu et al .  2011 ) .",
    "at this distance 1 arcmin corresponds to a projected distance of 10.2 kpc .",
    "the two dominant galaxies , ngc 5898 and ngc 5903 , are separated by 5.47 arcmin on the sky , while the third member , eso514@xmath0g003 is located 2.95 arcmin south of ngc 5903 ( rickes et al .",
    "basic optical and radio parameters of these galaxies are summarized in table 1 . in the soft x - ray band ,",
    "only upper limits are available for their luminosities ; these limits are 10@xmath9 , 10@xmath10 and 10@xmath11 ergs s@xmath8 for ngc 5903 , ngc 5898 ( beuing et al .  1999 ) and eso514@xmath0g003 ( burstein et al .  1997 ) , respectively .",
    "the first radio observations of this group were reported at 2640 mhz using the twin - element interferometer at the owens valley radio observatory , with an east - west spacing of 100 ft , yielding a flux density of 90@xmath1230 mjy for ngc 5903 ( rogstad & ekers 1969 ) .",
    "this was followed up with 5 ghz observations using the parkes radio telescope with a pencil - beam of 4 arcmin ( disney & wall 1977 ) .",
    "the radio source was found to be well resolved , having a size of @xmath13 arcmin and an integrated flux density of 104@xmath1230 mjy , with its peak closer to the dwarf galaxy eso514@xmath0g003 .",
    "a somewhat clearer picture emerged when this group was observed in the course of the ooty lunar occultation survey at 327 mhz ( gopal - krishna 1978 ) .",
    "the higher resolution achieved in those observations revealed two resolved sources , the brighter one coinciding with ngc 5903 .",
    "the fainter radio source identified with eso514@xmath0g003 was found to have a size of @xmath14 arcmin , with its major axis inclined eastward from the optical axis of the elongated host so galaxy .",
    "also , a comparison of these occultation observations with the available parkes pencil - beam measurements ( disney & wall 1977 ) revealed an unusually steep spectrum for the extended radio counterpart of ngc 5903 ( gopal - krishna 1978 ; table 1 ) .",
    "the massive elliptical companion ngc 5898 has , however , remained undetected in all the radio observations mentioned above , as well as in the later radio observations ( see below ) .    a major advance in the investigation of this system came from the work of apw90 who used the vla at 1.4 ghz to image both the radio continuum ( 30 arcsec beam ) and hi line emission ( 45 arcsec beam ) .",
    "their hi map showed an hi mass of @xmath15m@xmath16 to be associated with ngc 5903 , nearly a third of which is in a kinematically disturbed state and distributed along the galaxy minor axis , while the remainder is in the form of two huge hi trails extending towards the north and south from the inner hi distribution , with projected lengths of approximately 73 kpc and 27 kpc , respectively .",
    "the hi trails are probably the tidal debris left from an encounter with the disk galaxy eso 514@xmath00050 located 16 arcmin to the northeast from ngc 5903 ( apw90 ) .",
    "interestingly , while no hi was found associated with the massive elliptical companion ngc 5898 , the southern hi filament was found to approach the dwarf companion eso 514@xmath00050 .",
    "the conspicuous lack of both radio continuum and hi emission from ngc 5898 seemed particularly striking , when contrasted with the situation for the remaining two members of the group , namely ngc 5903 and eso 514@xmath0g003 .",
    "both these galaxies , which were already known to host extended radio sources ( see above ) , were now also found to be potential sites of hi gas accretion .    thus , the apparently correlated presence ( or absence ) of synchrotron radio emission and ongoing hi accretion , exhibited by all 3 early - type galaxies of this group could be a manifestation of the importance of cold gas accretion for triggering the nuclear jet activity in elliiptical galaxies , as hypothesized in many papers ( sect .",
    "however , this seemingly self - consistent picture encountered a setback due to the assertion of apw90 that the double radio source ( of size @xmath17 arcmin ) which had previously been identified with the lenticular eso514@xmath0g003 in the ooty lunar occultation survey mentioned above , was in fact significantly offset from the galaxy and hence probably a background radio source unrelated to eso514@xmath0g003 . in this paper",
    "we shall revisit these discrepant findings , using the recent observations made with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt , swarup et al .",
    "1991 ; ananthakrishnan 2005 ) , which have revealed in unprecedented detail the structure of the extended radio synchrotron emission from this compact group of galaxies at 150 mhz . in sect .  2 we briefly recapitulate the main optical properties of this system and in sect .  3 we present the new radio data",
    "a discussion and conclusions are in sect .",
    "the salient features of the two dominant members of the group are presented below .    *",
    "ngc 5903 : * this galaxy of the morphological type e2 has an extended red nucleus ( sparks et al .  1985 ) .",
    "macchetto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have detected in its inner parts , a @xmath18 kpc@xmath19 wide region of ionised gas , extended along the galaxy major axis .",
    "this region encompasses a dusty patch of size @xmath203.3 kpc inferred from the @xmath21 colour index map , which is slightly elongated at p.a .",
    "@xmath22 ( ferrari et al .  1999 ) .",
    "according to rickes et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the observed mgii abundance gradient is consistent with the origin of this massive galaxy , of dynamical mass @xmath23 m@xmath24 , in merger events .",
    "their stellar population synthesis has revealed at least two stellar populations with ages of 13 gyr and 5 gyr and , possibly , a younger population of age @xmath14 gyr , which is mainly discernible in the central parts of this elliptical .",
    "deep v - band imaging has revealed a modest degree of tidal disturbance in the stellar body of this galaxy , which is typical of nearby massive ellipticals in groups , which are thought to grow mainly via  dry \" mergers ( tal et al .  2009 ) .",
    "however , serra & oosterloo ( 2010 ) have argued that the presence of cold gas may often play a significant role in the assembly of massive galaxies outside cluster environments .",
    "finally , slit spectra taken along the optical major axis of this elliptical show little rotation of the stellar body , while the ionized gas has an irregular velocity profile along the radius ( caon , macchetto & pastiroza 2000 ; also longo et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "* ngc 5898 : * this nearly circular e0.5 elliptical shows an outer arc of dust and an inner red patch of elliptical shape .",
    "the gap between them indicates either intermittent accretion or a rapid dissipational process ( sparks et al .  1985 ) .",
    "macchetto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have detected a roughly circular central patch of ionised gas of diameter @xmath13 kpc .",
    "a deep v - band image shows tidal disturbance that is much stronger than is typical of nearby massive ellipticals in groups ( tal et al .",
    "2009 ) , and thus suggestive of a major merger event .",
    "this is consistent with the complex kinematics revealed by the detection of a counter - rotating stellar core on the galaxy major axis ( pa @xmath25 ) , with a transition radius of 1 kpc and a gas rotation which , remarkably , is opposite to that of the stars on the galaxy minor axis ( caon et al .",
    "2000 ; bertola & bettoni 1988 ) .",
    "figure 1 reproduces a new radio map of this compact group , taken from the 2nd data release ( dr2 ) of the ongoing tifr.gmrt.sky.survey ( tgss ) which is in the process of imaging the entire sky north of declination @xmath26 at 150 mhz with a resolution of @xmath27 arcsec and a typical rms noise of 57 mjy / beam ( the value for the present map is on the lower side , being only 3  4 mjy / beam ) .",
    "the radio contours are overlaid on the r - band optical photograph reproduced from the digital sky survey . in figure 2",
    "we show the same radio image in grey scale , overlaid on which are the outermost ( lowest ) 4 contours of hi emission , reproduced from the vla map made by apw90 .",
    "lastly , we show in figure 3 the 150 mhz ( tgss ) and 1.4 ghz ( nvss ) emission contours in the region of the dwarf so galaxy eso514@xmath0g003 .",
    "the tgss map at 150 mhz has unravelled , for the first time , the complexity of the radio emission associated with this group of 3 early - type galaxies , although the massive elliptical ngc 5898 is still undetected .",
    "the 150 mhz image of the other massive elliptical , ngc 5903 , exhibits a number of interesting features , including a jet - like structure of size @xmath20 1 arcmin and flux density 350 @xmath12 65 mjy , protruding from the elliptical towards the southwest .",
    "the galaxy is surrounded by a diffuse radio halo of diameter @xmath28 7.5 arcmin ( 77 kpc ) and flux density @xmath28 6.7 @xmath12 1.1 jy encompassing a web of radio filaments and extending over the region bounded by the galaxy triplet . since the filaments have not been discerned in the previously published radio maps at higher frequencies , probably due to their lower resolution ( sect .",
    "1 ) , it is presently not possible to determine their radio spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , the available data do provide reliable estimate of the integrated radio spectrum of this elliptical ngc 5903 between 150 mhz and 1.4 ghz where the maps have adequate resolution ( table 1 ) .",
    "although the highest frequency at which this source has been mapped is 5 ghz , the published value of 104 @xmath12 30 mjy measured with the 4 arcmin parkes pencil - beam can only be regarded as a generous upper limit , since much of this emission is contributed by the dwarf neighbour eso 514@xmath0g003 , as inferred from the marked shift in the radio centroid at 5 ghz towards it ( see table 2 of disney & wall 1977 ) .",
    "the spectral index for ngc 5903 is ultra - steep ( @xmath29 , with @xmath30 ) , in agreement with the previous estimate ( gopal - krishna 1978 ) .",
    "the 150 mhz map is also useful for clarifying the confusion over the radio emission from eso 514@xmath0g003 , the least massive , lenticular member of this triplet . as mentioned in sect . 1",
    ", apw90 found the bright symmetric double radio source in their 1.4 ghz vla map ( resolution @xmath31 ) to be significantly displaced from the optical galaxy ; they concluded that it is an unrelated background radio source ( with an undetected optical counterpart ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the lunar occultation scans at 327 mhz were consistent with a physical association of the radio source with the lenticular galaxy ( gopal - krishna 1978 ) . to pursue the matter , we have overlaid on the galaxy image the contours of radio emission at 150 mhz ( tgss ) and 1.4 ghz ( nvss ) , also marking the position of the mid - point of the symmetric double radio source seen in the 1.4 ghz vla map by apw90 ( their fig .",
    "as seen from figure 3 , the position offset of the galaxy eso514@xmath0g003 from the tgss position of the centre of the double radio source at 150 mhz is 8 arcsec ( which is at least a factor of two smaller than the offset of the galaxy from the apw90 position mentioned above ) , which is consistent with the expected tgss position uncertainty , given the confusion arising from the radio halo of ngc 5903 .",
    "likewise , a reasonable agreement of the galaxy position is also found with the nvss position at 1.4 ghz , though the radio source is poorly resolved due to the larger beam .",
    "thus , based on both tgss ( 150 mhz ) and nvss ( 1.4 ghz ) positions we conclude that the double radio source is associated with the lenticular eso514@xmath0g003 , in agreement with the lunar occultation results at 327 mhz ( sect .  1 ; gopal - krishna 1978 ) .",
    "note the westward extension of the double radio source visible in the tgss map raises the possibility that the radio source may actually be a triple source ( with a flux density of @xmath20 1150 @xmath12 190 mjy at 150 mhz ) , in which case the agreement with the galaxy position would be even better .",
    "based on their 1.4 ghz vla observations , apw90 characterised the radio counterpart of ngc 5903 as a head - tail radio source , with the tail extending to the southwest .",
    "such a radio morphology seems puzzling , since the host galaxy belongs to a very small group sparse in hot intra - group gas ( sect .",
    "the present tgss map at 150 mhz has revealed faint radio emission on the opposite , northeastern side of the galaxy as well .",
    "the radio source may thus be an asymmetric radio halo around ngc 5903 , with most of the radio emission located on the south - western side of the galaxy , within the region demarcated by the galaxy triplet ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the combination of high sensitivity and resolution of the 150 mhz tgss map has revealed an extensive network of radio filaments , the brightest of which fills the space delineated by the prominent hi trails which are seen to extend towards the south and southwest from ngc 5903 , in a ` bay ' like configuration ( figure 2 ) . as the filamentary structure has not been resolved at any other frequency , its radio spectrum is presently unknown .",
    "we shall make a plausible assumption that the radio emission is synchrotron radiation .",
    "figure 2 shows the morphological relationship of the radio continuum filaments to the hi trails reproduced from apw90 .",
    "based on the observed hi velocity gradients and other arguments , apw have estimated that the huge hi filaments are transient features that would have dissipated had they been older than @xmath32 yrs .",
    "the ultra - steep spectrum of the radio source ( @xmath33 , table 1 ) suggests that the source is very old and its age is likely to be of order of the maximum lifetime of the radio mode ( roughly @xmath34 yr , e.g. , leahy , muxlow & stephens 1989 ; liu et al .",
    "1992 ; barai & wiita 2006 ; croton et al .  2006 ; shabala et al .",
    "thus , the triggering of the currently observed radio source in ngc 5903 may well have coincided with the formation of the hi trails and cold gas accretion through them , onto the galactic nucleus .",
    "this situation is rare and contrasts with the usual pattern found for nearby radio - loud elipticals , wherein the detected radio source is much younger than the associated extended hi structure ( typically a regular rotating disk , or ring - like formation , stretching beyond the optical extent of the host elliptical ) ( e.g. , tadhunter et al .",
    "2005 ; emonts et al .  2006 ) .",
    "this has led to the view that if any radio activity was triggered at the time of a ( major ) merger between two gas - rich galaxies , resulting in an elliptical ( e.g. , naab , burkert & hernquist 1999 ) , the relic of that radio source is generally not visible any more ( e.g. , emonts et al .",
    "note that the latest major starburst episode in this elliptical is estimated to have occurred approximately 1 gyr ago ( rickes et al .",
    "2008 ) , which presumably predates the birth of the radio source we see today .",
    "however , based on the recent evidence , the link between starburst and radio - loud nuclear activity does not seem to be strong ( dicken et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "further , this nearby galaxy provides a striking manifestation of the influence of the hi tidal trails on the radio morphology . from figure 2 the brightest radio filament",
    "is aligned with the inner ( eastern ) edge of the southwestern bright hi trail .",
    "this alignment , together with the lateral offset from the hi ridge - line , appears to signify a dynamical interaction of the hi trail ( presumably infalling onto ngc 5903 ) with the surrounding synchrotron plasma that led to compression of the magnetic field along its eastern edge .",
    "this process could boost the radio emission locally , if relativistic particles are entangled in the regions of compressed magnetic field associated with the hi filaments .",
    "such a ` trapping ' of the synchrotron plasma by the hi filaments amounts to a kind of prolonged ` inertial containment ' of the synchrotron plasma , which could explain the ultra - steep spectrum of the diffuse radio source at metre wavelengths , even though such spectrum is generally not expected for sources outside clusters of galaxies , where the confining hot gaseous environment is lacking ( sect .  1 ) .",
    "lastly , a highly suggestive correlation emerging from the present work derives from our establishing the radio counterpart to the so galaxy eso514@xmath0g003 . with this",
    ", two members of this triplet of early - type galaxies are shown to have radio counterparts and these two galaxies are also the only ones that appear connected to hi trails and therefore likely to be accreting the cool hi gas .",
    "the third member , the dominant elliptical ngc 5898 is radio quiet and also unconnected to any hi trail ( apw90 ) . with the obvious caveat of small number statistics ( such a relation has a 1/8 chance of occurring randomly in the present case , if both hi gas and radio emission are independent and each have a probability of @xmath35 ) , this correlation between radio loudness of an early - type galaxy and its physical connection to an hi filament ( or , vice versa ) , seems entirely consistent with the importance of cold gas accretion in triggering and sustaining powerful jet activity in the galactic nuclei , as highlighted in the recent literature ( e.g. , best et al .",
    "2005 ; croton et al .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the correlation with radio emission arises because , in comparison to ionized gas ( viz . ,",
    "the case of bondi accretion : allen et al .",
    "2006 ; hardcastle et al .  2007 ;",
    "balmaverde et al .  2008 ; buttiglione et al .",
    "2010 ) , cold gas is more amenable to fast accretion merely because any infalling cold gas would encounter much less resistance from the substantial magnetic fields likely to exist within the cores of massive galaxies .",
    "we are conducting a search of other small groups mapped by tgss that also have hi data available , to investigate whether the correlation between hi filaments and radio activity in early - type galaxies seen in this particular triplet remains valid .",
    "the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) is a national facility operated by the national centre for radio astrophysics ( ncra ) of the tata institute of fundamental research ( tifr ) .",
    "we thank the staff at ncra and gmrt for their support .",
    "this research has used the tifr .",
