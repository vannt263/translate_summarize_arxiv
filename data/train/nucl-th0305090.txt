    "the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model ( ncsm ) @xcite is a method to solve the nuclear structure problem for light nuclei considered as systems of @xmath9 nucleons interacting by realistic inter - nucleon forces .",
    "the calculations are performed using a large but finite harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) basis . due to the basis truncation",
    ", it is necessary to derive an effective interaction from the underlying inter - nucleon interaction that is appropriate for the basis employed .",
    "the effective interaction contains , in general , up to @xmath9-body components even if the underlying interaction had , e.g. only two - body terms . in practice ,",
    "the effective interaction is derived in a sub - cluster approximation retaining just two- or three - body terms .",
    "a crucial feature of the method is its convergence to exact solution with increasing basis size and/or an increase in the effective interaction clustering .    in the past",
    ", applications were limited to only realistic two - nucleon interactions .",
    "however , the recent introduction of the capability to derive a three - body effective interaction @xcite and apply it in either relative - coordinate @xcite or cartesian - coordinate @xcite formalism together with the ability to solve a three - nucleon system with a genuine three - nucleon force in the ncsm approach @xcite opens the possibility to include a realistic three - nucleon interaction ( tni ) in the ncsm hamiltonian and perform calculations for the @xmath0-shell nuclei .",
    "we note that there are several methods that can be used to solve the @xmath10 systems with realistic hamiltonians that include a realistic three - body interaction .",
    "however , until now , only the green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method @xcite is capable to obtain solution for light @xmath0-shell nuclei with a hamiltonian that includes both realistic two- and three - nucleon force .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an extension of the ncsm formalism to accommodate the tni and present first applications for several @xmath0-shell nuclei .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to introduce the formalism needed to perform _ ab initio _ shell - model calculations for the @xmath0-shell nuclei with hamiltonians that include a realistic three - nucleon interaction . at the same time",
    ", we present a snapshot of first applications for several @xmath0-shell nuclei of different masses with the primary goal of assessing a general impact of a realistic tni on the structure of different @xmath0-shell nuclei . in this study , we limit ourselves to the use of a single tni , the chiral - symmetry based tucson - melbourne tm@xmath7(99 ) @xcite , combined with the argonne v8@xmath7 nn potential @xcite .",
    "more detailed studies using a broader variety of realistic three - nucleon interactions will follow in the future .    in section [ sec_theory ] , the extension of the ncsm formalism to include realistic three - nucleon forces",
    "is discussed . in section [ sec_res ]",
    ", we present first results obtained with hamiltonians that include the tucson - melbourne tm@xmath7(99 ) tni for @xmath1li , @xmath2he , @xmath3be , @xmath4b , @xmath5n and @xmath6c .",
    "some overall observations of the effect of the tni are gathered in section  [ tni ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section [ sec_concl ] .",
    "a detailed description of the ncsm approach was presented , e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite . here , we emphasize extensions and modifications needed when a genuine tni is included . in the case when the tni is considered , the starting hamiltonian is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the nucleon mass , @xmath13 , the nn interaction with both strong and electromagnetic components , @xmath14 the three - nucleon interaction . in the ncsm",
    ", we employ a large but finite harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) basis . due to properties of the realistic nuclear interaction in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , we must derive an effective interaction appropriate for the basis truncation . to facilitate the derivation of the effective interaction , we modify the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) by adding to it the center - of - mass ( cm ) ho hamiltonian @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the effect of the ho cm hamiltonian will later be subtracted out in the final many - body calculation . due to the translational invariance of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) the ho cm hamiltonian has in fact no effect on the intrinsic properties of the system in the infinite basis space .",
    "the modified hamiltonian can be cast into the form @xmath18 + \\sum_{i <",
    "j}^a \\left [ v_{{\\rm nn } , ij } -\\frac{m\\omega^2}{2a } ( \\vec{r}_i-\\vec{r}_j)^2 \\right ] + \\sum_{i < j < k}^a v_{{\\rm nnn } , ijk } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next we divide the @xmath9-nucleon infinite ho basis space into the finite active space ( @xmath19 ) comprising of all states of up to @xmath20 ho excitations above the unperturbed ground state and the excluded space ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the basic idea of the ncsm approach is to apply a unitary transformation on the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega ] ) , @xmath22 such that @xmath23 .",
    "if such a transformation is found , the effective hamiltonian that exactly reproduces a subset of eigenstates of the full space hamiltonian is given by @xmath24 .",
    "this effective hamiltonian contains up to @xmath9-body terms and to construct it is essentially as difficult as to solve the full problem .",
    "therefore , we apply this basic idea on a sub - cluster level . when a genuine tni is considered , the simplest approximation is a three - body effective interaction approximation . the ncsm calculation",
    "is then performed with the following four steps :    \\(i ) we solve a three - nucleon system for all possible three - nucleon channels characterized by a fixed angular momentum , isospin and parity with the hamiltonian ( [ hamomega ] ) , i.e. , using @xmath25 note that in eq . ( [ h3 ] ) , @xmath26 corresponding to the investigated nucleus is kept in @xmath27 as defined in ( [ hamomega ] ) .",
    "consequently , the three nucleons feel a pseudo - mean field of the spectator nucleons generated by the ho cm potential .",
    "it is necessary to separate the three - body effective interaction contributions from the tni and from the two - nucleon interaction .",
    "therefore , we need to find three - nucleon solutions for the hamiltonian with and without the @xmath28 tni term .",
    "the three - nucleon solutions are obtained by procedures described in refs .",
    "@xcite ( without tni ) and @xcite ( with tni ) .",
    "in particular , we note that we use two - body effective interaction corresponding to a very large three - nucleon basis space , i.e. , up to @xmath29 , to obtain these solutions .",
    "the number of three - nucleon channels to include in the calculations is restricted by the maximal active space @xmath30 to be used in the final @xmath9-nucleon calculation .",
    "\\(ii ) we construct the unitary transformation corresponding to the choice of the active basis space @xmath31 from the three - nucleon solutions using the lee - suzuki procedure @xcite .",
    "in particular , we demand that @xmath32 .",
    "let us remark that the definition of the three - nucleon active space @xmath31 is determined by the definition of the @xmath9-nucleon active space @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath31 states contains all three - nucleon states up to the highest possible three - nucleon excitation , which can be found in the @xmath19 space of the @xmath9-nucleon system .",
    "for example , for @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) space we have @xmath31 defined by @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath0-shell nuclei with @xmath37 and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) space we have @xmath38 .",
    "we note that the anti - hermitian transformation operator @xmath39 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath40 with the operator @xmath41 satisfying @xmath42 .",
    "if the eigensystem of the hamiltonian @xmath43 ( [ h3 ] ) is given by @xmath44 , then the operator @xmath41 can be determined from @xmath45 where the tilde denotes the inverse of the matrix defined by matrix elements @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 , for @xmath48 . in eq .",
    "( [ omegasol ] ) , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the active - space and the @xmath51-space basis states , respectively , and @xmath52 denotes a set of @xmath53 eigenstates , whose properties are reproduced in the @xmath19-space , with @xmath53 equal to the dimension of the @xmath19-space .",
    "the set @xmath52 is typically chosen by selecting the lowest three - nucleon eigenstates for the given three - nucleon channel . in practice , to calculate the @xmath19-space matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian , we apply the eqs .",

    "this transformation is a generalization of the well - known transformation on the two - body level that depend on ho brody - moshinsky brackets .",
    "the antisymmetrized jacobi - coordinate ho basis in which the three - body effective interaction is obtained can be represented in the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the total number of ho excitation , @xmath63 is an additional quantum number enumerating the antisymmetrized states , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the total three - nucleon angular momentum and isospin , respectively , and @xmath60 , @xmath66 their third components .",
    "this basis can be expanded in a @xmath67 nucleon cluster basis using expansion coefficients , i.e. , @xmath68 ho state describes relative motion of nucleon 1 and 2 , @xmath69 describes the relative motion of the third nucleon with respect to the cm of nucleons 1 and 2 , and @xmath70 is the coefficient of fractional parentage .",
    "it holds that @xmath71 . for further details and the procedure how to calculate the expansion coefficients",
    "the basis for the three - body effective interaction suitable for the shell - model code input is a three - nucleon slater - determinant ho basis characterized by @xmath72 , @xmath73 and parity , formed by the single particle states @xmath74 that depend on the single - particle coordinates .",
    "we introduce a short - hand notation for these slater - determinant states , i.e. , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 labels the occupied states . in order to transform the three - body effective interaction to the new basis",
    "we need first to couple the relative coordinate basis ( [ ja_bas ] ) with the three - nucleon cm ho states @xmath77 to form a complete basis .",
    "the three - body effective interaction is independent on the @xmath78 quantum numbers .",
    "the overlap of the two respective states can then be expressed in the form @xmath79 where we explicitly show the total ho quantum number conservation that also implies parity conservation , the angular momentum and isospin third component conservation .",
    "the sum goes over the expansion ( [ ja_bas ] ) , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and the @xmath12 quantum numbers in the clebsch - gordan coefficients not appearing on the left - hand side",
    ". the @xmath84 are the generalized brody - moshinsky brackets for two - particles of mass ratio @xmath85 as defined e.g. , in ref .",
    "sums of the clebsch - gordan coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ v3trans ] ) can be re - expressed as sums of 6-j and 9-j coefficients .",
    "however , some clebsch - gordan coefficients will remain as we have a magnetic quantum number dependence on the left - hand side .",
    "it should be pointed out that the overlap ( [ v3trans ] ) is independent of the ho frequency @xmath86 , and for a given @xmath20 , it needs to be calculated just once .",
    "the three - body effective interaction @xmath60-scheme matrix elements are then obtained by @xmath87    \\(iv ) we solve the schrdinger equation for the @xmath9-nucleon system using the hamiltonian @xmath88 where the @xmath89 factor takes care of over - counting the contribution from the two - nucleon interaction . at this point",
    "we also subtract the @xmath90 and add the lawson projection term @xmath91 to shift the spurious cm excitations .",
    "just as the bare interaction is translationally invariant , so is the effective interaction , and the energies of the physical eigenstates corresponding to the @xmath92 excitation of the cm are independent on the choice of @xmath93 .",
    "the @xmath9-nucleon calculation is then performed using either the many - fermion dynamics shell model code @xcite generalized to handle three - body interactions or using the newly developed code redstick @xcite , using a different algorithm for evaluating the hamiltonian matrix elements , with the hamiltonian in the form : @xmath94 + \\frac{1}{a-2}\\sum_{i < j < k}^a v_{{\\rm 3eff } , ijk}^{\\rm nn } + \\sum_{i < j < k}^a v_{{\\rm",
    "3eff } , ijk}^{\\rm nnn } + \\beta(h_{\\rm cm}-\\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega)\\ ; .\\ ] ] we summarize this section by repeating that the effective interaction depends on the nucleon number @xmath9 , the ho frequency @xmath86 , and the @xmath19-space basis size defined by @xmath20 .",
    "it is translationally invariant and with @xmath95 the ncsm effective hamiltonian approaches the starting bare hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "consequently , with the basis size increase the ncsm results become less and less dependent on the ho frequency and converge to the exact solution . alternatively , by increasing the clustering of the effective interaction for a fixed @xmath19-space size the ncsm effective hamiltonian approaches the exact @xmath9-nucleon effective hamiltonian that reproduces exactly a subset of eigenstates of the starting hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "the calculations with the three - body interactions are technically and computationally intensive . when a genuine tni is employed the step ( i ) from the previous section is computationally demanding .",
    "in addition , when a three - body effective interaction is used in general , the steps ( iii ) and ( iv ) are complex as well . in these first ncsm calculations with the tni in the @xmath0-shell , we limit ourselves to the use of a single realistic interaction .",
    "in particular , we use the isospin invariant av8@xmath7 nn potential @xcite that is a simplified version of the av18 nn potential . for the tni",
    ", we employ a version of the original tucson - melbourne force @xcite corrected to drop a term later found to be inconsistent with the chiral - symmetry - based effective field theory tni of two - pion range @xcite .",
    "we note that there have been different strength constants ( taken from pion - nucleon scattering data ) suggested for this force @xcite .",
    "we use only one particular set , i.e. the tm@xmath7(99 ) updated strength constants of the tucson - melbourne tni that was introduced in ref .",
    "we summarize the strength constants and other numbers employed in the present investigation in table [ tmparam ] .",
    "the cutoff @xmath81 is the only parameter in the tni and it is set to @xmath96 by fitting the @xmath97h binding energy using the av8@xmath7 + tm@xmath7(99 ) interactions .",
    "we add the coulomb potential to the hamiltonian perturbatively , that is only in the @xmath19-space .",
    "the ncsm calculations depend in general on the ho frequency and the basis size .",
    "the basis size is limited by the available computational resources and the algorithm development . in this paper",
    ", we were able to reach the @xmath35 basis space for @xmath98 .",
    "for higher masses , we limited ourselves to the @xmath99 basis space .",
    "the optimal ho frequency is selected in the ncsm by the requirement of the least dependence of the eigenergies on the frequency .",
    "typically , for the @xmath0-shell nuclei we select the optimal frequency by finding the ground - state energy minimum in the largest accessible basis space . due to the complexity of the calculations with the tni , in this study we rely on our previous investigations done without the tni to select the optimal frequency and perform comparative calculations with and without the tni .",
    "more detailed frequency dependence investigations will be done later .",
    "the steps ( i ) and ( ii ) of the calculations as described in section [ sec_theory ] are performed using the jacobi - coordinate many - body effective interaction code ( _ manyeff _ )",
    "@xcite extended to handle the tni as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . when calculating the three - body effective interaction induced by the two - nucleon potential , @xmath100 ( [ v3eff_2b ] ) , we are able reach large three - nucleon basis spaces , e.g. @xmath101 , to obtain high precision three - nucleon solutions .",
    "due to the complexity of the calculations with the tni we were , however , limited in this work to smaller spaces , up to @xmath102 @xcite , when the tni was included in the hamiltonian ( [ h3 ] ) .",
    "this was sufficient to obtain the @xmath97h binding energy within 50 kev of the exact result , see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "nevertheless , it would still be useful to further increase @xmath103 in the future .",
    "in particular because here we employ a lower ho frequency for which we expect a slower convergence than for that used in the @xmath97h calculations . in order to calculate the @xmath104 ( [ v3eff_3b ] )",
    "it is essential to use the same @xmath103 to obtain ( [ v3eff ] ) and ( [ v3eff_2b ] ) .",
    "therefore , we performed three calculations , one up to @xmath101 to calculate @xmath100 ( [ v3eff_2b ] ) in all relevant three - nucleon channels and two for ( [ v3eff ] ) and ( [ v3eff_2b ] ) in the same basis space up to @xmath102 for the three - nucleon channels up to @xmath105 to calculate @xmath104 ( [ v3eff_3b ] )",
    ". we will improve on this in our future studies as also discussed in the concluding section . the step ( iii )",
    "is performed by a specialized code that reads the outputs of the _ manyeff _ code and the step ( iv ) is then performed using either the many - fermion dynamics shell model code @xcite generalized to handle three - body interactions or using the newly developed code redstick @xcite .    in order to get the most accurate assessment of the effect of the genuine three - nucleon interaction in the following we always compare calculation with and without the tni using identical basis size , ho frequency and the clustering approximation , i.e. , the three - body effective interaction .",
    "we note that bare nucleon charges and unrenormalized transition operators were used in all the transition calculations presented in this paper . for some transitions , e2 in particular",
    ", the operator renormalization could be important .",
    "the operator renormalization can be calculated as outlined , e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , and is now under development . in the gamow - teller transition calculations , the @xmath106 constant was not included in the presented b(gt ) values .",
    "finally , let us remark that all the presented calculated states in this paper are the @xmath0-shell or the @xmath92 dominated states .",
    "the opposite parity ( @xmath107 ) and the @xmath108-dominated states were investigated within the ncsm , e.g. in refs . @xcite .",
    "such states are not obtained at low enough energy in the basis spaces used in the present investigation .",
    "therefore , in this paper comparison is made with experimental levels known to be predominantly of @xmath0-shell character .",
    "we investigated @xmath33 nuclei using two - nucleon interactions in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath2li in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite where we used three - body effective interaction derived from the av8@xmath7 .",
    "our @xmath2li results with the tni are summarized in table [ tab_li6 ] and fig .",
    "[ li6_exc_tm ] .",
    "we show the basis size dependence up to @xmath35 using the optimal frequency @xmath109 mev .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ li6_exc_tm ] that the basis size dependence is quite similar in the calculations with and without the tni and it is important that the excitation energies of the low - lying states in particular show a good stability and a convergence pattern when the @xmath35 basis space is reached . at the same time we can see a significant sensitivity of the excitation spectra to the presence of the genuine three - nucleon interaction .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath110 state excitation energy decreases significantly and it gets closer to experiment when the tni is included .",
    "also , the @xmath111 splitting , which is underestimated with just a two - nucleon interaction , increases significantly .",
    "our calculated @xmath2li binding energy increases by more than 2.5 mev when the tni is included . with tighter",
    "binding with the tni the point - proton radius decreases slightly similarly as the b(e2 ) value of the @xmath112 transition .",
    "the ground - state quadrupole moment and the m1 transitions are not much affected , although there appears to be an improvement for the @xmath113 m1 transition .",
    "our @xmath2he results are summarized also in table [ tab_li6 ] .",
    "apart from increased binding energy , there are little differences between the calculations with and without the tni . in the same table",
    ", we show the b(gt ) values obtained for the @xmath2he@xmath114li ground - state to ground - state transition .",
    "clearly , the tni shifts the result in the right direction closer to experiment although a discrepancy still remains .",
    "recently , schiavilla and wiringa found that the av18/urbana - ix interaction also over - predicts the @xmath2he@xmath114li b(gt ) value @xcite .",
    "in fact , their obtained gamow - teller matrix elements ( @xmath115 ) , 2.254(5 ) and 2.246(10 ) using two types of wave functions , compare well with our result 2.283 for av8@xmath7+tm@xmath7(99 ) .",

    "the three - body effective interaction basis space is defined by @xmath38 and there are 741 823 056 three - nucleon @xmath60-scheme matrix elements that we input in the shell model code .",
    "although the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix is only 663 527 , it is significantly less sparse when a three - body interaction is present , e.g. , there are 4 555 058 857 non - zero matrix elements compared to 235 927 305 for a calculations with just a two - body interaction .    from our @xmath116li results we can draw similar conclusions as from the @xmath2li results .",
    "a particularly important observation is the excitation energy convergence pattern , i.e. , good stability of the spectra when increasing the basis size from @xmath99 to @xmath35 for both calculations with the tni and without the tni .",
    "there is an expected increase of binding energy and sensitivity of the spectra to the presence of the tni .",
    "the level ordering is unchanged for the 9 levels that we show . note that when compared to the old experimental evaluation of ref .",
    "@xcite we obtain the reversed order of @xmath117 and @xmath118 states , consistently with previous ncsm studies , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the new evaluation @xcite changes the order and energies of the two levels and , in addition , adds a new @xmath119 level .",
    "our calculated level ordering then matches the new evaluated level ordering .",
    "note that our calculation with the tni shows a slightly improved relative level spacing for those three levels compared to experiment .",
    "similarly , the relative level spacing of the @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 states is improved compared to experiment in the calculation with the tni .",
    "also we note that the lowest two excited states , @xmath123 and @xmath120 , move closer to experiment when the tni is present .    in table",

    "it should be pointed out that our excitation spectra calculation without the tni is actually in a very reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "it is comforting that turning on the tm@xmath7(99 ) three - nucleon interaction does not really change the excitation spectrum very much and the quality of agreement with experiment is about the same . with the tni we gain almost 4 mev of binding energy .",

    "combined with our observed sensitivity for higher excited states this shows that nuclear structure will play an important role in determining the form and the parametrization of the three - nucleon interaction that , unlike the two - nucleon interaction , is still not well known . concerning the binding energies , with the tm@xmath7(99 ) we gain almost 6 mev for the @xmath110 state and about 4 mev for the @xmath137 state .",
    "our @xmath132be and @xmath132c results are presented also in table [ tab_b10 ] .",
    "in particular , we paid attention to the gamow - teller transitions from the @xmath132b ground state to the @xmath138 states of @xmath132be and the transition from the @xmath132c ground state to the @xmath137 state of @xmath132b .",

    "it is not straightforward to make a correct correspondence to the experimental @xmath143 levels in particular above 10 mev of excitation energy .",
    "we follow refs . @xcite in making assignments in table [ tab_b11 ] and fig .",
    "[ b11_exc_tm ] .",

    "similarly as for @xmath132b , in fig . [ b11_exc_tm ] , the two - nucleon interaction excitation energy results are displayed relative to the @xmath123 state while in table [ tab_b11 ] the same results are given relative to the @xmath145 state . given the complicated situation in neighboring @xmath132b , it is quite interesting to investigate @xmath141b .",
    "although we have not done a detailed frequency dependence study as for @xmath132b , our present calculation suggest that the av8@xmath7 nn potential by itself might produce the incorrect ground state @xmath123 instead of the experimentally observed @xmath145 state .",
    "more calculations are needed to explore this issue but based on our present calculations we can definitely expect that a realistic two - nucleon interaction will predict the @xmath146 and @xmath147 states almost degenerate . in our @xmath99 calculation with the av8@xmath7 we obtain an incorrect ground state spin for @xmath141b . by including the tm@xmath7(99 )",
    "this is corrected together with the level ordering of @xmath121 and @xmath117 states .",
    "in addition , the level spacing improves for majority of the low - lying states shown in fig . [ b11_exc_tm ] and table [ tab_b11 ] . the binding energy gain is about 6 mev .    as for @xmath141b , the calculation with the tni produces a superior excitation spectrum and the correct ground - state spin for @xmath141c .",
    "an exception where there is a shift away from experiment in the calculations with the tni appears for the ground - state magnetic moments of @xmath141b and @xmath141c .",
    "recently , the gamow - teller transition strength for the @xmath141b@xmath148c was measured from the @xmath141b(@xmath149)@xmath141c reaction @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab_b11 ] , we summarize the experimental and our calculated gamow - teller transition results . overall , much better agreement is obtained in the calculation with the tni .",
    "detailed @xmath5c ncsm calculations using realistic two - nucleon interactions were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we extend those calculations by including the tni . in table",

    "once the tm@xmath7(99 ) is included we obtain the correct @xmath152 state as the lowest @xmath129 state and , moreover , the correct ordering of the next two lowest @xmath129 states , @xmath139 and @xmath151 .",
    "we note that in fig .",
    "[ c12_exc_tm ] we also show low - lying @xmath5c states that are dominated by higher than @xmath0-shell configurations .",

    "it is well known that the isovector @xmath153 transition from the @xmath5c ground state to the 15.11 mev @xmath152 state is very sensitive to the strength of the spin orbit interaction .",

    "[ c12_bm1 ] .",
    "the calculations with the 2-nucleon interaction show saturation and under - predict the experiment by almost a factor of three . by including the three - nucleon interaction ,",
    "the b(m1 ) value increases dramatically .",
    "this improvement is almost entirely due to the improved strength of the spin - orbit splitting when the three - nucleon interaction is included .",
    "the basis size dependence is stronger in this case .",
    "clearly , if we were able to extend our calculations to the @xmath35 space , we would get much closer to the b(m1 ) experimental value .",
    "we also note a substantial increase and overall better agreement with experiment for the b(e2 ; @xmath155 ) in the calculation with the tni ( see table [ tab_c12 ] ) .",
    "our results for @xmath5n and @xmath5b presented in table [ tab_c12 ] further support the above discussed observations .",

    "it is interesting to note the complicated situation concerning the magnetic moments of the @xmath5n and @xmath5b ground states . in the calculation",

    "as we discussed earlier our calculated states presented in this study are all @xmath92 dominated .",
    "it is important to make a correct correspondence to the experimental levels as it is to be expected that the @xmath134-shell dominated states would appear at low energies in @xmath158c .",
    "the character of low - lying @xmath158c states was studied in ref .",
    "we use assignments found in ref .",

    "[ c13_exc_tm ] . despite the complexity of the @xmath158c excitation",
    "spectra the ncsm calculation obtains the lowest six states in correct order in both calculations with and without the tni . when the tni is included the lowest five states excitation energies improve compared to experiment .",
    "note in particular an increase of the excitation energy of the @xmath145 state .",
    "also , the position of the lowest @xmath144 state @xmath159 improves . from table [ tab_c13 ] we can see that our av8@xmath7+tm@xmath7(99 ) @xmath99 calculation slightly overbinds @xmath158c",
    ". similar comment as in subsection [ subs_c12 ] on @xmath5c applies .",
    "we expect the binding energy decrease with the basis enlargement .",
    "overall , we find that three - nucleon interactions , and in particular the tm@xmath7(99 ) force employed in this work , do have an important effect on nuclear structure . of course , the primary expectation from previous studies of three- and four - nucleon systems with exact methods , is that the tni will provide more binding energy in many - body systems .",
    "this requirement was certainly verified with previous ncsm and gfmc studies using realistic nn interactions .",
    "this is also borne out in the tables , and in the discussion that follows we focus primarily on the @xmath160 nuclei , where the results with just the nn - interaction are reasonably converged , and are likely to be within 1  mev of the exact results  @xcite . for @xmath2li , the nn - interaction accounts for nearly 89% of the binding energy , while for @xmath116li , @xmath124be , and @xmath132b it accounts for 84 - 86% of the total binding .",
    "the tm@xmath7(99 ) force then contributes an additional binding of the order 8 - 10% of the value obtained from the nn - interaction alone .",
    "what is somewhat remarkable is that the results with the tni in @xmath2li come quite close to the experimental binding energy ( underbinding by less than 1  mev ) , while the tni significantly underbinds the @xmath161 nuclei by 3.5 - 4.2 mev .",
    "it is interesting that the underbinding becomes more dramatic with the addition just a single nucleon , i.e. , from @xmath2li to @xmath116li .",
    "the nature of the underbinding requires further research .",
    "we plan to address three avenues of investigation .",
    "the first is the effects of the smaller three - particle model space on the convergence of the three - body effective interaction , which may be more severe for smaller oscillator frequencies .",
    "although , our expectation is that the full effect of the underbinding is not due to a convergence issue .",
    "efforts to upgrade the computer programs used to evaluate @xmath162 to use larger three - particle model spaces are underway .",
    "second , we are also in the process of improving our shell - model codes to extend the calculations up to @xmath163 for @xmath98 and @xmath34 for @xmath164 nuclei .",
    "this extension is important in order to be able to fully assess the effect of the tni on the structure of @xmath165 nuclei . finally , with these new capabilities",
    ", we hope to turn to the form of the tni itself , which is not yet fully determined .",
    "the other important feature of the tni is the enhancement of spin - orbit effects .",
    "this is particularly evident in @xmath132b , where the inversion of the @xmath135 and @xmath166 states is a clear indication that the nn - interaction by itself is insufficient .",
    "a similar ground - state level inversions are observed for @xmath141b , and @xmath5n , @xmath5b .",
    "it is to be noted that the correct ordering is obtained with a realistic tni with no free parameters ( other than a cutoff fixed by reproducing the @xmath167 binding energies ) .",
    "in addition , several calculated gamow - teller and @xmath153 transitions are in better agreement with experiment when the tni is included .",
    "these results are promising in that the inclusion of the tni can improve our overall picture of the structure of light nuclei .",
    "we extended the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model to include a realistic three - body interaction in calculations for @xmath0-shell nuclei .",
    "we presented results of first applications to @xmath1li , @xmath2he , @xmath124be , @xmath4b , @xmath5n and @xmath168c using the argonne v8@xmath7 nn potential and the chiral - symmetry - based tucson - melbourne tm@xmath7(99 ) three - nucleon interaction .",
    "in general , in addition to increase of binding energy , we observed a substantial sensitivity of the low - lying spectra to the presence of the realistic three - nucleon interaction and a trend toward level - ordering and level - spacing improvement in comparison to experiment .",
    "the sensitivity is the largest for states where the spin - orbit interaction strength is known to play a role .",
    "in particular , with the tni we obtain the correct ground - state spin for @xmath8b and @xmath5n , @xmath5b , contrary to calculations with nn potentials only .",
    "in addition , we observe an overall improvement of the gamow - teller transition description in calculations with the three - nucleon interaction .",
    "the most striking case appears in @xmath169 nuclei for the @xmath170 transitions .    unlike two - nucleon interaction , a detailed form and parametrization of the tni",
    "is not well established yet , and it is highly likely that the sensitivity of the excitation spectra to the presence of the three - nucleon interaction could be exploited in determining the structure of the three - nucleon interaction itself .",
    "this is a topic that we plan to pursue in the future .",
    "until now calculations with a realistic tni in the @xmath0-shell has been performed only using the gfmc method @xcite and by the coupled cluster method for @xmath171o @xcite .",
    "our ncsm approach has some advantages compared to those methods such as access to wider range of nuclei and also obtaining a more complete set of excited states .",
    "an important issue for the ncsm is the convergence which implies the need to use as large basis space as possible . with some algorithm and coding developments",
    "it should be feasible to perform @xmath172 calculations with the tni for the light @xmath0-shell nuclei and @xmath35 calculations for the rest of the @xmath0-shell in a near future .",
