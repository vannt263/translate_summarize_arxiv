    "there has been a great deal of excitement during this past year following the realization that certain field theories admit concrete realizations as a string theory on a particular background @xcite . by now many examples of this type of correspondence for field theories in various dimensions with various field contents have been reported in the literature ( for a comprehensive review and list of references , see @xcite ) .",
    "however , attempts to apply these correspondences to study the details of these theories have only met with limited success so far .",
    "the problem stems from the fact that our understanding of both sides of the correspondence is limited . on the field theory side ,",
    "most of what we know comes from perturbation theory where we assume that the coupling is weak . on the string theory side ,",
    "most of what we know comes from the supergravity approximation where the curvature is small .",
    "there are no known situations where both approximations are simultaneously valid . at the present time",
    ", comparisons between the dual gauge / string theories have been restricted to either qualitative issues or quantities constrained by symmetry .",
    "any improvement in our understanding of field theories beyond perturbation theory or string theories beyond the supergravity approximation is therefore a welcome development .    in this note",
    "we raise the supersymmetric discrete light cone quantization ( sdlcq ) of field theories @xcite to the challenge of providing quantitative data which can be compared against the supergravity approximation on the string theory side of the correspondence .",
    "we will work in two space - time dimensions where the sdlcq approach provides a natural non - perturbative solution to the theory .",
    "in general , attempts to improve the field theory side beyond perturbation theory seem like a promising approach in two space - time dimensions where a great deal is already known about field theories beyond perturbation theory .",
    "we will study the field theory / string theory correspondence motivated by considering the near - horizon decoupling limit of a d1-brane in type iib string theory @xcite .",
    "the gauge theory corresponding to this theory is the yang - mills theory in two dimensions with 16 supercharges .",
    "its sdlcq formulation was recently reported in @xcite .",
    "this is probably the simplest known example of a field theory / string theory correspondence involving a field theory in two dimensions with a concrete lagrangian formulation .",
    "a convenient quantity that can be computed on both sides of the correspondence is the correlation function of gauge invariant operators @xcite .",
    "we will focus on two point functions of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "this turns out to be a very convenient quantity to compute for many reasons that we will explain along the way .",
    "some aspects of this as it pertains to a consideration of black hole entropy was recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "there are other physical quantities often reported in the literature . in the dlcq literature ,",
    "the spectrum of hadrons is often reported .",
    "this would be fine for theories in a confining phase .",
    "however , we expect the sym in two dimension to flow to a non - trivial conformal fixed point in the infra - red @xcite . the spectrum of states will therefore form a continuum and will be cumbersome to handle . on the string theory side , entropy density @xcite and the quark anti - quark potential @xcite are frequently reported .",
    "the definition of entropy density requires that we place the field theory in a space - like box which seems incommensurate with the discretized light cone .",
    "similarly , a static quark anti - quark configuration does not fit very well inside a discretized light - cone geometry .",
    "the correlation function of point - like operators do not suffer from these problems .",
    "we should mention that there exists interesting work on computing the qcd string tension @xcite directly in the field theory .",
    "these authors find that the qcd string tension vanishes in the supersymmetric theories which is consistent with the power law quark anti - quark potential found on the supergravity side .",
    "let us begin by reviewing the computation of the correlation function of stress energy tensors on the string theory side using the supergravity approximation .",
    "the computation is essentially a generalization of @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion on the supergravity side was reported recently in @xcite but we will elaborate further on the details .",
    "the near horizon geometry of a d1-brane in string frame takes the form @xmath2 in order to compute the two point function , we need to know the action for the diagonal fluctuations around this background to the quadratic order . what we need is an analogue of @xcite for this background which unfortunately is not currently available in the literature .",
    "fortunately , some diagonal fluctuating degrees of freedom can be identified by following the early work on black hole absorption cross - sections @xcite . in particular",
    ", we can show that the fluctuations parameterized according to @xmath3 will satisfy the equations of motion @xmath4 by direct substitution into the equations of motion in 10 dimensions .",
    "we have assumed without loss of generality that these fluctuation vary only along the @xmath5 direction of the world volume coordinates like a plane wave @xmath6 .",
    "the fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 are scalars when the d1-brane is viewed as a black hole in 9 dimensions ; in fact there are the minimal and the fixed scalars in this black hole geometry . in 10 dimensions",
    ", however , we see that they are really part of the gravitational fluctuation .",
    "we expect therefore that they are associated with the stress - energy tensor in the operator field correspondence of @xcite . in the case of the correspondence between @xmath9 sym and @xmath10 ,",
    "superconformal invariance allowed the identification of operators and fields in short multiplets @xcite .",
    "for the d1-brane , we do not have superconformal invariance and this technique is not applicable .",
    "in fact , we expect all fields of the theory consistent with the symmetry of a given operator to mix .",
    "the large distance behavior should then be dominated by the contribution with the longest range .",
    "the field @xmath11 appears to be the one with the longest range since it is the lightest field .",
    "the equation ( [ fgeq ] ) for @xmath7 can be solved explicitly in terms of the bessel s function @xmath12 by thinking of @xmath7 in direct analogy with the minimally coupled scalar as was done in @xcite , we can compute the flux factor @xmath13 up to a numerical coefficient of order one which we have suppressed .",
    "we see that the leading non - analytic ( in @xmath14 ) contribution is due to the @xmath15 term , whose fourier transform scales according to - brane , @xmath16 @xmath17 this result passes the following important consistency test .",
    "the sym in 2 dimensions with 16 supercharges have conformal fixed points in both uv and ir with central charges of order @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we expect the two point function of stress energy tensors to scale like @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the deep uv and ir , respectively . according to the analysis of @xcite",
    ", we expect to deviate from these conformal behavior and cross over to a regime where supergravity calculation can be trusted .",
    "the cross over occurs at @xmath22 and @xmath23 . at these points ,",
    "the @xmath19 scaling of ( [ sg ] ) and the conformal result match in the sense of the correspondence principle @xcite .",
    "the challenge then is to attempt to reproduce the scaling relation ( [ sg ] ) , fix the numerical coefficient , and determine the detail of the cross - over behavior using sdlcq .",
    "ever since the original proposal @xcite , the question of equivalence between quantizing on a light - cone and on a space - like slice have been discussed extensively .",
    "this question is especially critical whenever a massless particle or a zero - mode in the quantization is present .",
    "it is generally believed that the massless theories can be described on the light - cone as long as we take @xmath24 as a limit .",
    "the issue of zero mode have been examined by many authors .",
    "some recent accounts can be found in @xcite . generally speaking , supersymmetry seems to save sdlcq from complicated zero - mode issues .",
    "we will not contribute much to these discussions .",
    "instead , we will formulate the computation of the correlation function of stress energy tensor in naive dlcq . to check that these results are sensible",
    ", we will first do the computation for the free fermions and the t hooft model .",
    "extension to sym with 16 supercharges will be essentially straightforward , except for one caveat . in order to actually evaluate the correlation functions",
    ", we must resort to numerical analysis at the last stage of the computation . for the sym with 16 supercharges",
    ", this problem grows too big too fast to be practical on desk top computer where the current calculations were performed",
    ". we can only provide an algorithm , which , when executed on an much more powerful computer , should reproduce ( [ sg ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , the fact that we can define a concrete algorithm seems to be a progress in the right direction .",
    "one potential pit - fall is the fact that the computation may not show any sign of convergence .",
    "if this is the case , or if it converges to a result at odds with ( [ sg ] ) , we must go back and re - examine the issue of equivalence of forms and the issue of zero modes .",
    "the technique of dlcq is reviewed by many authors @xcite so we will be brief here .",
    "the basic idea of light - cone quantization is to parameterize the space using light cone coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 and to quantize the theory making @xmath25 play the role of time . in the discrete light cone approach , we require the momentum @xmath27 along the @xmath26 direction to take on discrete values in units of @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the conserved total momentum of the system and @xmath30 is an integer commonly referred to as the harmonic resolution .",
    "one can think of this discretization as a consequence of compactifying the @xmath26 coordinate on a circle with a period @xmath31 .",
    "the advantage of discretizing the light cone is the fact that the dimension of the hilbert space becomes finite .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian is a finite dimensional matrix and its dynamics can be solved explicitly . in sdlcq",
    "one makes the dlcq approximation to the supercharges and these discrete representations satisfy the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "therefore sdlcq enjoys the improved renormalization properties of supersymmetric theories .",
    "of course , to recover the continuum result , we must send @xmath30 to infinity and as luck would have it , we find that sdlcq usually converges faster than the naive dlcq .",
    "of course , in the process , the size of the matrices will grow , making the computation harder and harder .",
    "let us now return to the problem at hand .",
    "we would like to compute a general expression of the form @xmath32 in dlcq , where we fix the total momentum in the @xmath26 direction , it is more natural to compute its fourier transform @xmath33 this can naturally be expressed in a spectrally decomposed form @xmath34      let us first consider evaluating this expression for the stress - energy tensor in the theory of free dirac fermions as a simple example .",
    "the lagrangian for this theory is @xmath35 where for concreteness , we take @xmath36 and we take @xmath37 . in terms of the spinor components ,",
    "the lagrangian takes the form @xmath38 since we treat @xmath25 as time and since @xmath39 does not have any derivatives with respect to @xmath25 in the lagrangian , it can be eliminated from the equation of motion , leaving a lagrangian which depends only on @xmath40 : @xmath41 we can therefore express the canonical momentum and energy as @xmath42 in dlcq , we compactify @xmath26 to have period @xmath43 .",
    "we can then expand @xmath40 and @xmath44 in modes @xmath45 operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 with positive and negative @xmath48 are interpreted as a destruction and creation operators , respectively .",
    "in a theory with only fermions , it is customary to take anti - periodic boundary condition in order to avoid zero - mode issues",
    ". therefore , @xmath48 will take on half - integer values .",
    "they satisfy the anticommutation relation @xmath49 now we are ready to evaluate ( [ master ] ) in dlcq . as a simple and convenient choice ,",
    "we take @xmath50 which is the fourier transform of the local expression for @xmath51 with the total derivative contribution adjusted to make this operator hermitian .",
    "therefore , this should be thought of as the @xmath52 component of the stress energy tensor . for reasons that will become clear as we go on ,",
    "this turns out to be one of the simplest things to compute .",
    "when acted on the vacuum , this operator creates a state @xmath53 since the fermions in this theory are free , the plane wave states @xmath54 constitute an eigenstate .",
    "the spectrum can easily be determined by commuting these operators : @xmath55 which is simply the discretized version of the spectrum of a two body continuum .",
    "all that we have to do now is calculate eigenstates of the actual theory we are interested in and to assemble these pieces into ( [ master ] ) , but we can do a little more to make the result more presentable .",
    "the point is that since ( [ master ] ) is expressed in mixed momentum / position space notation in minkowski space , the answer is inherently a complex quantity that is cumbersome to display .",
    "for the computation of two point function , however , we can go to position space by fourier transforming with respect to the @xmath56 variable .",
    "after fourier transforming , it is straight forward to euclideanize and display the two point function as a purely real function without loosing any information . to see how this works ,",
    "let us write ( [ master ] ) in the form @xmath57 the quantity inside the absolute value sign is designed to be independent of @xmath56 .",
    "now , to recover the position space form of the correlation function , we inverse fourier transform with respect to @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 the integral over @xmath56 can be done explicitly and gives @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the 4-th modified bessel s function .",
    "we can now continue to euclidean space by taking @xmath62 to be real and considering the quantity @xmath63 this is a fundamental result which we will refer to a number of times in this paper .",
    "it has explicit dependence on the harmonic resolution parameter @xmath30 , but all dependence on unphysical quantities such as the size of the circle in the @xmath26 direction and the momentum along that direction have been canceled . for the free fermion model , ( [ general ] )",
    "evaluates to @xmath64 with @xmath65 given by ( [ mass ] ) .",
    "the large @xmath30 limit can be gotten by replacing @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we recover the identical result using feynman rules . for @xmath68 ,",
    "this behaves like @xmath69      let us now turn to a slightly more interesting problem of computing the correlation function of @xmath52 in t hooft s model of two dimensional qcd @xcite in the large @xmath19 limit .",
    "this theory has two characteristic scales , one determined by the mass of the quarks and the other by the strength of the gauge coupling @xmath70 .",
    "to a large extent , this is a solvable model .",
    "the spectrum and the wave function of the hadrons are encoded in a one parameter integral equation that can be handled in many ways .",
    "a thorough analysis of this model including the discussion of asymptotic behavior of certain correlation functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "this is clearly a very mature subject .",
    "applying dlcq to the t hooft model is tantamount to placing t hooft s integral equation for the meson spectrum on a lattice .",
    "the lattice is in the light - cone momentum space , which is precisely what is expected when the light - cone is compactified on a circle .",
    "the dlcq of the t hooft model was analyzed in detail by @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to show that the computation of ( [ master ] ) is straight forward and that it generates sensible answers .",
    "in fact , nothing could be simpler .",
    "the t hooft model is nothing more than a gauged version of the free fermion model .",
    "the lagrangian for this theory is simply @xmath71 we choose the light cone gauge @xmath72 which is customary .",
    "one then finds that the @xmath73 component of the gauge field is non - dynamical and can be eliminated using the equation of motion , just like the @xmath39 component of the spinor in the free fermion model . expressing everything in terms of the only dynamical field in this theory which is @xmath40",
    ", one finds the canonical energy and momentum operators to take the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "all that changed in comparison to the free fermion model is the addition of a current exchange term in the light - cone hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , all we have to do here is to perform the identical computation specified by ( [ general ] ) , but using the modified hamiltonian , and letting @xmath76 and @xmath77 be the spectrum and the wavefunction of the @xmath48-th meson state in the spectrum . since in dlcq",
    "we are always working with a finite dimensional representation of the hamiltonian dynamics , a small change in the form of the hamiltonian matrix causes no particular difficulty .",
    "let us discuss the result of such a computation .",
    "we will consider the case when @xmath78 so that the effect of the gauge interaction is strong .",
    "the spectrum can be computed reliably for large @xmath30 and is in agreement with the results reported in @xcite ( see figure [ figa].a ) . since the state ( [ state ] ) created by operator ( [ operator ] ) is odd under parity @xmath79 , only parity odd states contribute in the spectral decomposition . for @xmath80",
    ", we expect the correlation function to behave just like the free fermion .",
    "the lightest meson in the parity odd sector has a mass of order @xmath81 . due to the presence of this mass - gap , for @xmath82",
    ", we expect to see an exponential damping of the correlation function .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this article , we have provided a prescription for computing the correlation function of the stress energy tensor @xmath52 in the sdlcq formalism , which may be readily compared with predictions provided by a supergravity analysis following the conjecture of maldacena .",
    "such a comparison requires non - perturbative methods on the field theory side , and the sdlcq approach appears at first sight to be particularly well suited to this task .",
    "unfortunately , at the present time , high enough resolution calculation have not been made to evaluate expression ( [ general ] ) accurately enough in the case of sym with 16 supercharges to reproduce ( [ sg ] ) .",
    "significant progress is expected however when these calculation are moved from desk top computers to a supercomputer .",
    "ultimately the main obstacle will be that the number of allowed states in the sdlcq wavefunctions grows exponentially with the resolution .",
    "nevertheless , a concrete well defined algorithm is a great starting point for further investigations , and additional insight may be gained by studying models with less supersymmetry , as we have done here .",
    "thus , the answer to the question posed in the title is a qualified `` yes . ''",
    "equation ( [ general ] ) may be compared against ( [ sg ] ) using sdlcq , and unless other computational approaches such as the lattice technique catches up , the sdlcq approach remains the most viable option .",
