    "since their discovery in 1991  @xcite , carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have attracted considerable interest worldwide because of their unusual properties and great potentials for technological applications .",
    "cnts can be regarded as a layer of graphene sheet rolled up in a tubular form  @xcite , and the structure of a cnt is specified by a chiral vector defined by a pair of integers ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "cnts can be chiral or nonchiral depending on the way they are rolled up . their physical properties , in particular , optical dielectric functions , depend sensitively on their chirality , i.e. , the ( @xmath15 ) indices ( see , e.g. , ref . and references therein )",
    "apart from cnts , inorganic tubular materials , such as bn  @xcite , aln  @xcite , gan  @xcite , have also been predicted and synthesized .",
    "these tubular materials also display some very interesting properties distinctly different from their bulks .",
    "bulk silicon carbide ( sic ) crystallizes in either a cubic or a hexagonal form , and exbihits polytypism  @xcite .",
    "the polytypes are made of identical hexagonal layers with different stacking sequences .",
    "these polytypes are semiconductors with a range of band gaps , from 2.39 ev in the zincblende ( 3c ) to 3.33 ev in the wurtzite polytype ( 2h )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , 3c and 6h sic are used for high temperature , high - power and high - frequency devices  @xcite due to their unique properties  @xcite , while 6h sic with a band gap of 2.86 ev is a useful material for blue light - emitting diode applications  @xcite .",
    "recently , sic - nts were also synthesized by the reaction of cnts and sio at different temperature  @xcite .",
    "this has stimulated a number of both theoretical and experimental investigations on the tubular form of the sic  @xcite .",
    "based on density - functional calculations , miyamoto and yu  @xcite predicted the existence of graphitic and tubular forms of sic and also proposed their synthesis using an extreme hole injection technique .",
    "they also reported that the strain energies of sic - nts are lower than that of cnts , and that the band gaps of sic - nts can be direct or indirect , depending on the chirality . using both tight - binding molecular dynamics and @xmath16 methods , menon and coworkers",
    "@xcite showed that single - walled sic - nts are highly stable with a large band gap",
    ". zhao @xmath17",
    "@xcite also investigated theoretically the strain energy , atomic and electronic structure of sic - nts with or without hydrogenation .",
    "gali performed an _ ab initio _ study of the effect of nitrogen and boron impurities on the band structure of the sic - nts  @xcite .    unlike cnts ,",
    "sic - nts are polar materials and therefore , may exhibit some unusual physical properties that cnts may not have .",
    "for example , zigzag sic - nts may become piezoelectric , and also show second - order non - linear optical response . despite the intensive theoretical studies mentioned above , no @xmath16 calculation of the dielectric response and optical properties of sic - nts has been reported , perhaps because of the heavy demand on computer resources .",
    "a knowledge of the optical properties of sic - nts is important for their optical and electrooptical applications .",
    "the primary objective of this work is to analyze the band structure and optical characteristics of all three types of the sicnts by @xmath16 calculations .",
    "this will help to distinguish the electronic and optical properties of cnts and bn - nts from that of sic - nts .",
    "our @xmath16 calculations are also needed to help understand the existing and future optical experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next sec . , the theoretical approach and computational method are described . in sec .",
    "iii , the band structure , density of states ( dos ) , electron energy loss spectra ( eels ) , optical dielectric function of the single sic sheet and sic - nts are discussed . finally , conclusions are given in sec .",
    "our _ ab initio _ calculations for the sic - nts are performed using the accurate full - potential projector augmented wave ( paw ) method  @xcite , as implemented in the vasp package .  @xcite they are based on density - functional theory ( dft ) with the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "the supercell method is used such that the identical sic tubes are aligned in a square array and the closest interwall distance between the adjacent tubes is at least 10  .",
    "we consider a number of the sic - nts with different diameters and chirality ( @xmath14 ) from all three types , as listed in table i.    first , the ideal sic - nts are constructed by rolling up a graphitic hexagonal sic sheet .",
    "the atomic positions and lattice contants were then fully relaxed by the conjugate gradient ( cg ) method .",
    "the theoretical equalibrium atomic positions and lattice constant were obtained when the forces acting on all the atoms and the axial stress are less than 0.04 ev / @xmath5 and 1.0 kbar , respectively . in these atomic position optimizations , a uniform grid ( 1@xmath181@xmath18n ) along the nanotube axis ( @xmath19-axis ) with the number @xmath20 of the @xmath21-points being from 30 to 50 . the special @xmath21-point method and the gaussian broadening technique",
    "were used for the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration .",
    "the length of theoretical translational vector @xmath22 and theoretical diameter @xmath23 are listed in table i. the curvature energy @xmath24 ( total energy relative to that of single sic sheet ) ( also known as the strain energy ) of the sic - nts is listed in table ii .",
    "note that for the nanotubes with a moderate diameter ( @xmath25  ) , the equilibrium structures are already found to be almost the same as that of the ideal nanotubes constructed by rolling - up a sic sheet with a si - c bondlength of 1.771  .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the calculated @xmath24 of the nanotubes with such a diameter is already smaller than 0.05 ev / atom ( table ii ) .",
    "interestingly , like cnts and bn - nts , the calculated @xmath24 of the sic - nts can be very well fitted with @xmath26 with @xmath27 = 2.004 ev@xmath28@xmath29/atom , indicating that the conventional elastic theory works well even down to such a small length scale .",
    "@xmath27 for the sic - nts is identical to that of the cnts but larger than that ( 1.248 ev @xmath29/atom ) of the bn - nts calculated previously using the same band structure method  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath27 of @xmath41.75 ev @xmath29/atom reported in ref .",
    "is somewhat smaller than the present calculations .",
    ".theoretical structural parameters of the sic nanotubes studied .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the calculated optical dielectric functions of some selected zigzag @xmath33 $ ] , armchair @xmath34 $ ] , chiral @xmath35 $ ] sic - nts are shown in figs .",
    "5 - 7 , respectively .",
    "the spectra can be roughly divided into two regions , namely , the low - energy one from @xmath42 to 6 ev and the high - energy one from 6 to 15 ev .",
    "below about 2 ev ( the band gap region ) , the @xmath36 is zero and @xmath37 tends to a constant as the photon energy approaches zero .",
    "for the electric field parallel to the tube axis ( @xmath6 ) , the @xmath36 for all the three types of the sic - nts with a moderate diameter ( say , @xmath3 @xmath8 9  ) in the low - energy region consists of a single distinct peak at @xmath43 ev plus a long shoulder of @xmath42 ev on the higher photon energy side ( figs .",
    "this is very similar to the case of bn - nts found in ref .  .",
    "nonetheless , the peak in the sic - nts ( figs . 5 - 7 ) is about twice as high as that in the bn - nts  @xcite , because the bn - nts have a band gap which is in general twice wide than that of the sic - nts .",
    "however , this is in strong contrast to the case of cnts in which the distinct features have been found especially for the semiconducting chiral nanotubes  @xcite and these features can be used to characterize the chirality of the grown carbon nanotubes by optical means  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , for small diameter sic nanotubes , the @xmath36 spectrum can deviate markedly from the general behavior described above ( see figs .",
    "5 - 7 ) . for example , for the armchair ( 4,4 ) nanotube ,",
    "the pronounced peak at @xmath43 ev in the @xmath36 spectrum mentioned above is absent ( fig .",
    "6a ) . for the chiral ( 4,2 )",
    "nanotube , the pronounced peak in the @xmath36 spectrum shifts to low energy side by about 0.6 ev ( fig .",
    "7a ) . in the high - energy region ,",
    "the @xmath36 for all the types of the sic - nts have a broad peak of @xmath46 ev wide centered at @xmath48 ev .    for the electric field perpendicular to the tube axis ( @xmath9 )",
    ", the @xmath36 spectrum of all the sic - nts except the small diameter nanotubes such as the ( 8,0 ) and ( 4,4 ) , in the low energy region also consists of a pronounced peak at around 3.5 ev whilst in the high - energy region is , roughly , made up of a broad hump starting from 6.0 ev ( figs . 5 - 7 ) .",
    "the magnitude of the peaks is in general about half of the magnitude of the corresponding ones for @xmath6 , showing a moderate optical anisotropy in the sic - nts . in nanotubes ,",
    "the electric field perpendicular to the nanotube axis is generally strongly screened  @xcite , and this is known as the depolarization effect which is not taken into account in the present calculations .",
    "the depolarization effect may substantially reduce the magnitude of the @xmath36 spectrum for @xmath9  @xcite , and hence enhance the optical anisotropy .",
    "let us now compare the optical dielectric function of the sic - nts with that of the single sic sheet .",
    "it is clear from fig . 1 and figs . 5 - 7 that the @xmath36 spectrum for @xmath6 of the sic - nts is very similar to that of the single sic sheet for @xmath11 .",
    "this is particularly true for the large or even moderate diameter sic - nts in which the curvature effect is small .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising because the electric field polarization is parallel to the sic layer in both cases .",
    "however , the @xmath36 spectrum for @xmath9 is rather different from that of @xmath11 of the single sic sheet .",
    "in particular , the @xmath36 spectrum for @xmath11 for the photon energy below @xmath45 ev is zero in the single sic sheet ( fig .",
    "1 ) , whilst in contrast , the @xmath36 spectrum for @xmath9 of the sic - nts has a pronounced peak at @xmath43.5 ev ( figs . 5 - 7 ) .",
    "this perhaps can be explained as follows . when @xmath9 , it is clear that for some parts of the tube wall , the electric field is nearly perpendicular to the sic layer whilst for the other parts of the tube wall , it is roughly parallel to the sic layer .",
    "therefore , the dielectric function for @xmath9 may be regarded as a mixture of the dielectric functions for both @xmath11 and @xmath38 of single sic sheet .",
    "this can be seen from inspection of fig . 1 and figs . 5 - 7 , and is especially clear for the large diameter sic - nts . as a result , the calculated optical anisotropy of the large sic - nts is smaller than that of the single sic sheet . nevertheless , as mentioned before , the depolarization effect for @xmath9 in the sic - nts may considerably enhance the optical anisotropy of especially small diameter sic - nts .",
    "therefore , in optical experiments , one may still see a rather strong optical anisotropy because the @xmath36 spectrum for @xmath9 would be substantially reduced due to the depolarization effect .",
    "the optical dielectric function @xmath10 and electric polarizability @xmath39 in the zero frequency limit of the sic - nts are listed in table iii , and also displayed in figs . 8 and 9 .",
    "note that the @xmath10 [ @xmath39 ] is the electronic contribution only [ i.e. , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) ] , and hence not the full static dielectric response [ i.e. , @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) ] which also contains the ionic contribution . in ref .",
    ", it was found that including the ionic contribution would not change the observed trends , though the magnitude of the ionic contribution may be considerable .",
    "8 shows that to a first order approximation , the static dielectric constant @xmath10 is almost a constant ( i.e. , independent of the diameter ) . the average value of @xmath10 is 10.38 and 6.79 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the former is very close to @xmath47 of the single sic sheet , while the latter is close to the circular average of the response of each part of the sic - nt surface , which may be approximated by 0.5(@xmath47+@xmath48 ) with quantities for the single sic sheet ( see table iii ) .",
    "note that the static dielectric constants @xmath10 of the sic - nts are about two times larger than that of the bn - nts ( @xmath44.6 for @xmath45 and @xmath43.6 for @xmath46 )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sic - nts may be better dielectric materials than the bn - nts .",
    "it is clear from fig . 8",
    "that there is a pronounced anisotropy in the static dielectric response of the sic - nts .",
    "interestingly , there is a small but discernable chirality dependent oscillation centered at the average value of @xmath10 for both electric field polarizations . in particular , for @xmath45 , the zigzag sic - nts have a slightly larger dielectric constant than the armchair ones .",
    "the electric polarizability @xmath39 per unit length for both @xmath45 and @xmath46 is proportional to the tube diameter @xmath3 , as shown in fig .",
    "by fitting a linear function @xmath39=@xmath49 to the calculated @xmath39-vs-@xmath3 curves , we obtain a slope @xmath50 = 5.20 for @xmath46 , and a slope @xmath51 = 7.81 for @xmath45 .",
    "as pointed out before for the bn - nts  @xcite , this linear relation between @xmath39 and @xmath3 arises because the sic - nts are insulators in which the valence electrons are tightly bound to the ions and consequently , every atom of the same species has nearly the same static polarizability .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 is proportional to the number of atoms per unit length which in turn is proportional to @xmath3 . nevertheless , the sic - nts exhibit a much stronger dielectric response than the bn - nts since the bn - nts have significantly smaller slopes ( @xmath50 = 2.15 , @xmath51 = 3.04 ) .",
    "@xcite this is because the sic - nts have a smaller band gap than the corresponding bn - nts , as mentioned before .",
    "both the static dielectric constant @xmath10 and electric polarizability @xmath39 are clearly anisotropic .",
    "the anisotropy in electric polarizability can be best seen from the difference in the slopes between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath39 for @xmath45 is about 50 % larger than that for @xmath46 .",
    "the actual anisotropy may be even larger because of the calculated @xmath10 and @xmath39 for @xmath46 would be reduced when the depolarization effect were taken into account.@xcite      the calculated electron energy loss spectra of the zigzag , armchair and chiral sic nanotubes are shown in fig .",
    "first of all , in the low energy region up to 15 ev , the eels spectra for the all selected sic nanotubes for both @xmath45 and @xmath46 [ except ( 4,4 ) tube for @xmath45 ] ( fig .",
    "10 ) , look very similar to that of @xmath53 of the sic sheet ( fig .",
    "in particular , all the spectra have a rather pronounced @xmath13 plasmon peak at @xmath4 5 ev and then the spectra grow steadily with energy . in the high energy region from 15 ev upwards , the spectra are dominated by a large broad @xmath13+@xmath54 plasmon peak with the exact peak positon being dependent on the chirality and also the electric field polarization .",
    "for the zigzag nanotubes , the energy position of the @xmath13+@xmath54 plasmon peak is at @xmath422 ev for both electric field polarizations . for the chiral ( 4,2 ) and ( 8,4 ) nanotubes , respectively , the plasmon peak occurs at @xmath420 and @xmath422 ev for both @xmath45 . for the armchair sic nanotubes , the energy position of the @xmath13+@xmath54 plasmon peak appears to oscillate around 21.5 ev ( fig .",
    "10 c and d ) .    surprisingly , there is only weak anisotropy in the eels spectra for all the nanotubes ( fig .",
    "10 ) , in contrast to the rather pronounced anisotropy found in the dielectric functions ( figs . 5 - 7 ) .",
    "the weak anisotropy in the eels of the nanotubes may be attributed to the fact that for @xmath9 all the @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 optical transitions are excited whilst the single sic sheet only @xmath55 and @xmath56 transitions are possible for @xmath38 .",
    "an _ ab initio _ study of the structural , electronic and optical properties of the sic - nts within density functioanal theory in the local density approximation has been performed . in particular , the properties of the single walled zigzag @xmath1(3,0),(4,0),(5,0),(6,0),(8,0),(9,0),(12,0),(16,0),(20,0),(24,0)@xmath2 $ ] , armchair @xmath1(3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(8,8),(12,12),(15,15)@xmath2 $ ] , and chiral @xmath59 $ ] nanotubes have been calculated . for comparison , the electronic structure and optical properties of the single sic sheet have also been calculated .",
    "we find that all the sic nanotubes are semiconductors with exceptions of the ultrasmall ( 3,0 ) and ( 4,0 ) zigzag tubes which may be regarded as the thinnest conducting sic nanowires .",
    "interestingly , the energy band gap of the zigzag sic - nts may be reduced from the full energy gap of the sic sheet all the way down to zero by reducing the diameter ( fig .",
    "2 ) , though the band gap for all the sic nanotubes with a diameter larger than @xmath420 @xmath5 approaches that of the sic sheet . furthermore ,",
    "all the semiconducting zigzag sic - nts have a direct band gap .",
    "all these suggest that they may have interesting applications in optical and optoelectronic devices .",
    "nonetheless , both the armchair and chiral sic - nts have an indirect band gap .",
    "the optical properties of the sic - nts , as for the sic sheet , can be divided into two spectral regions , namely , the lower energy region ( 0@xmath46 ev ) , in which the optical transitions involve mainly the @xmath13-bands , and the higher energy region from 6 ev upwards , where interband transitions involve mainly the @xmath54-bands . for @xmath6 , the @xmath7 for all the three types of the sic - nts with a moderate diameter ( say",
    ", @xmath3 @xmath8 8 @xmath5 for the zigzag sic - nts , @xmath3 @xmath8 6 @xmath5 for the chiral sic - nts ) in the low - energy region consists of a single distinct peak at @xmath43 ev .",
    "however , for the small diameter sic nanotubes such as the ( 4,2),(4,4 ) sic - nts , the @xmath7 spectrum does deviate markedly from this general behavior . in the high - energy region ,",
    "the @xmath7 for all the sic - nts exhibit a broad peak centered near 7 ev . for @xmath9 , the @xmath7 spectrum of all the sic - nts except the ( 4,4 ) , ( 3,0 ) and ( 4,0 ) nanotubes , in the low energy region also consists of a pronounced peak at around 3 ev whilst in the high - energy region is roughly made up of a broad hump starting from 6 ev .",
    "the magnitude of the peaks is in general about half of the magnitude of the corresponding ones for @xmath6 , showing a moderate optical anisotropy in the sic - nts .",
    "interestingly , unlike the cnts , the calculated static dielectric constant @xmath10 for all the sic nanotubes is almost independent of diameter and chirality with @xmath10 for @xmath6 being only about 30 % larger than for @xmath9 .",
    "this is very similar to the case of the bn - nts except that the values of @xmath10 for the sic nanotubes are about two times larger than that of the bn - nts .",
    "the calculated electron energy loss spectra of all the sic nanotubes studied here for both electric field polarizations are rather similar to that of @xmath11 of the sic sheet , being dominated by a broad @xmath12-electron plasmon peak at @xmath4 21 ev and a small @xmath13-electron plasmon peak at @xmath43 ev .",
