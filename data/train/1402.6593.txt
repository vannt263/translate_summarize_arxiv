    "since @xmath215-mode is a kink mode , it is quite improbable that the observed oscillations of the thread are described by this mode .",
    "note that , in the linear approximation , the kink oscillation of the thread does not interact with the unstable mode causing its disappearance , and thus it does not affect the instability growth time .",
    "in the present paper we have extended the study by @xcite to the models of an interface and a slab with magnetic shear , and have focused on the mrt instability .",
    "the fact that the magnetic field changes its direction introduces a bounded growth rate of the instability .",

    "here we have focused on the maximum growth rate , representing the most unstable mode of the system , and have found analytical expressions in various limiting cases . for small angles of the shear the growth time is linearly proportional to the shear angle @xmath67 .",

    "the growth time depends only weakly on @xmath67 in the interface problem . in this limit",
    ", we have also been able to calculate an approximate expression for the growth time in the slab problem .",
    "we have shown , using a simple example , how it is possible to estimate the shear angle in threads belonging to active region prominences from the combination of observations and the theoretical results presented in this paper . using this method",
    "we have found that the observations of oscillating threads of @xcite are compatible with small shear angles ( around @xmath217 ) .",
    "this indirect method of inferring some of the equilibrium properties of threads can be potentially used as a seismological tool .",
    "several simplifications have been done in the models considered in this work .",
    "both the interface and slab configurations are unbounded in the perpendicular direction ( @xmath15-direction ) and we have assumed that there is dense material along the full length of the magnetic tube .",
    "however , in reality , threads only represent a small part of the full magnetic tube .",
    "compressibility and partial ionisation ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been also ignored .",
