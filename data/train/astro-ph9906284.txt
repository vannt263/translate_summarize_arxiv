    "we used the rate coefficients for collisional excitation of c  i from schrder et al .",
    "the  and @xmath5co column densities in the models do not depend strongly on the kinetic temperature assumed by van dishoeck and black ( see their models t6a and t6b )",
    ". uncertainties in predicted intensities from our lvg calculations therefore depend directly on the assumed kinetic temperature rather than indirectly through linewidth - dependent photochemical effects . in this rough comparison ,",
    "we have used t@xmath79=10 k to be consistent with measures of core temperatures in dark clouds ( e.g. benson & myers 1980 ) .",
    "we set the column density per unit velocity in the radiative transfer model equal to the  or @xmath5co column density from the theoretical model divided by the typical linewidth in the clouds .",
    "the results in figure 11 , where we have multiplied the model  by the beam efficiency to compare to the observations , show that the van dishoeck and black models for i@xmath14=1 correctly predict the c  i we observe in the maps of tmc1 and l134n .",
    "the observed @xmath5co  are comparable to the values for the models with the largest a@xmath78 .",
    "the morphology of the c  i and molecular emission from the clouds with i@xmath76 1 also supports the idea that the c  i line arises in material at the cloud surface . in both l134n and tmc1 ,",

    "if the c  i emission arises in a thin layer near the cloud surface and emission from molecular lines less opaque than the lowest few transitions of @xmath7co arise throughout the bulk of the cloud , there is no _ a priori _ reason to expect the c  i and @xmath5co or c@xmath6o  to correlate . nevertheless , the c  i and co isotopomer  correlate astonishingly well in high column density cloud cores illuminated by powerful uv fields like m17 sw ( keene et al .",
    "there is a clear difference in the  correlation between high-  clouds ( correlation coefficient = 0.85 for c  i vs. @xmath5co plume et al .",
    "1999 ) and the low-  dark clouds studied here ( correlation coefficient = 0.32 and 0.41 for c  i vs. @xmath5co in tmc1 and l134n , respectively ) .    for cloud cores , plume et al .",
    "( 1999 ) point out the similarity of the clump / interclump structure needed to produce the observed extent of the c  ii 158 @xmath15 m line emission to the kind of structure that would produce the high degree of spatial correlation between c  i and @xmath5co seen by keene et al .",

    "plume et al .",
    "argue that in extended gmc material , unlike the high column density cores , the c  i lines arise predominantly in a global layer over the entire face of the cloud .",
    "they explain the somewhat weaker c  i@xmath5co  correlation as a conspiracy of edge effects and the correlation of temperature and density variations with total column density . the lack of intensity correlations in tmc1 and l134n , then , results from an absence of temperature variations as well as from higher opacities in c  i @xmath18p@xmath74p@xmath75 and the lowest transitions of @xmath5co and c@xmath6o at low temperature ( see below ) .",
    "as is so dramatically illustrated in the small - scale c  i  molecular line comparisons toward the tmc1 ridge ( figure 4 and schilke et al . ) , the c  i observations toward clouds illuminated by i@xmath761 external fields do not contain any information about high column density molecular regions .",
    "the most striking feature of the data are the very narrow distributions of  seen in fig . 12 .",
    "such tight distributions are not seen in any molecular line besides co , which is opaque and thermalized .",
    "we suggest that the ci lines are also opaque and thermalized ; thus the values of  provide a probe of  in the pdr layer with @xmath80 .",
    "there are both observational and theoretical arguments for a high opacity in the c  i @xmath18p@xmath74p@xmath75 line .",
    "the large linewidth and , in tmc1 , flat - topped shape of the c  i lines are both indications that the opacity is high .",
    "furthermore , the peak intensity does not vary strongly despite significant variations in line width ( figures 1a , 5 , and 8) .",
    "if the lines were not thermalized , would be very sensitive to density fluctuations and the tight distribution seen in fig .",
    "12 would be extremely unlikely . to investigate the c  i opacity more thoroughly , we also computed spherical monte carlo models ( choi et al .",
    "1995 ) for photodissociated clouds .",
    "the temperature and c  i abundance versus distance output from a plane parallel pdr model with i@xmath14=1 and n@xmath81=10@xmath18 @xmath82 was mapped onto a spherical cloud ( see pak et al .",
    "1998 , van dishoeck & black 1987 ) with a microturbulent velocity dispersion of 0.65 km s@xmath28 . the model , which has a line center opacity @xmath362 ,",
    "correctly reproduces the linewidths seen in the @xmath18p@xmath74p@xmath75 spectra .",
    "assumptions about the cloud core temperature ( see below ) may mean that the c  i opacity is even higher .",
    "because the critical density for the @xmath18p@xmath74p@xmath75 transition is only 800 @xmath82 and the photon escape probabilities are substantially lower than unity , it is very likely that the transition is thermalized ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "if the c  i line is opaque and thermalized , it provides a probe of deep in the pdr layer , where @xmath80 . the distribution of  is shown in fig .",
    "13 for all the dark clouds and for orion a. the distribution for the dark clouds is remarkably tight : mean  is @xmath9 k , a 10% variation .",
    "the high frequency of the c  i @xmath18p@xmath74p@xmath75 transition means that it is in the wien limit for the temperatures we derive ; thus a tight distribution in  ( 30% variation ) becomes even tighter in .",
    "small variations in temperature would lead to an enormous fractional change in observed t@xmath61 ( t@xmath79=8@xmath343 k implies , for thermalized gas , a t@xmath61 range from 0.17 to 2.5 k , a factor of 15 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the range of  inferred for orion is much broader , consistent with a lower and more variable opacity ; thus the values of in orion are lower limits .",

    "the pdr models discussed above produce t@xmath8411.5 k in the line forming region .",
    "this higher t@xmath79 results in a @xmath363 k c  i line .",
    "the high predicted temperature may be , in part , an artifact of the assumption that the asymptotic cloud core temperature was 10 k or of slight differences between the actual and theoretical thermal balance .",
    "recent models by kaufman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find that  drops below 10 k for very small ratios of  to density .",
    "comparison to their predictions of intensity finds agreement with our observations only at low  and quite high density ( @xmath85 @xmath82 ) .",
    "is there other evidence for such low  in low-  clouds ?",
    "clemens , yun , & heyer ( 1991 ) found that 74% of a sample of such clouds have @xmath86 k.    why do the c  i layers have such a constant temperature ? given the inevitability of density fluctuations , what causes the thermal balance to choose this temperature ?",
    "one strong possibility is that neutral carbon itself provides the thermostat .",
    "the fact that the c  i line is in the wien portion of the planck function at these low  means that the cooling power in the 492 ghz line rises very rapidly with temperature in the 5 - 10 k range . in the specific layer where",
    "c  i is present , the higher opacity of the @xmath7co line and the low abundance of @xmath5co may keep the rotational lines of co isotopomers from contributing strongly to the cooling . indeed models by hollenbach , takahashi , & tielens ( 1991 ) indicate that c  i cooling does dominate in the layer where neutral atomic carbon is abundant .",
    "if our interpretation is correct , the higher transition of c  i , @xmath87@xmath88 at 809 ghz , will be very weak toward these clouds .",
    "an upper limit can be obtained by assuming that the higher transition is also opaque and thermalized . in this case , the radiation temperature ( or @xmath89 ) is 0.3 k. however , the higher line is very unlikely to be opaque .",
    "even if the levels are thermalized , the optical depth in the higher line will be only 0.16 that of the lower line .",
    "more realistic estimates can be obtained from models of clouds in weak uv fields , combined with lvg calculations . model t6",

    "we derive @xmath96 ( c  i)/@xmath96 ( @xmath7co @xmath3 = 2@xmath41 ) = 1.9@xmath340.3 for tmc-1 and 1.0@xmath340.5 for ic 5146 .",

    "the uniform intensity and large linewidth of the c  i lines , as well as models of low - i@xmath14 photodissociation regions imply that the c  i @xmath18p@xmath74p@xmath75 transition is thermalized and optically thick .",
    "the uniform t@xmath61=1.0@xmath340.3 k , together with the high frequency of the c  i line , means that the kinetic temperature in the emitting layer is remarkably constant , t@xmath79(c  i layer)=7.9@xmath340.8 k. we suggest that the c  i emission itself acts as a thermostat in controlling the temperature of this layer in low - i@xmath14 clouds .",
