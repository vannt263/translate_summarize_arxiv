    "the crucial feature of these solutions , which we will refer to as `` q - holes '' , is expressed by the inequality @xmath45 .",

    "apart from this fact , from the point of view of the mechanical analogy , q - bulges lie close to q - balls .",
    "let us briefly discuss the main properties of q - holes and q - bulges .",
    "first , their asymptotes at infinity , @xmath47 imply that the frequency @xmath6 of the q - hole ( q - bulge ) is fixed by the frequency of the scalar condensate of magnitude @xmath41 .",
    "second , the charge and the energy of the q - hole ( q - bulge ) are defined in the standard way , @xmath48 when being calculated at a given q - hole ( q - bulge ) configuration , the expressions ( [ q , e_1 ] ) are clearly infinite .",
    "however , since @xmath49 as @xmath50 , it is reasonable to compute the charge and the energy of the q - hole ( q - bulge ) relative to the corresponding background solution ( [ scalcondans ] ) .",

    "are finite as we will explicitly demonstrate below .",
    "furthermore , they obey the following relation , @xmath54 which is analogous to that for q - balls . ) is also fully analogous to that for q - balls , the latter can be found in @xcite . ]",
    "last , but not least , the following key property of q - holes ( q - bulges ) can be deduced from eqs .",
    "( [ q , e_2 ] ) , @xmath55 the relation ( [ dedq ] ) is also well known to be valid for q - balls ( with @xmath56 and @xmath57 substituted by the genuine charge and energy of the q - ball ) .",
    "this justifies the meaningfulness of our notions of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "note that since for q - holes the inequality @xmath58 holds for all @xmath59 , the sign of @xmath56 is opposite to the sign of @xmath6 and the renormalized energy @xmath57 is not positive definite . to prevent possible confusion , we stress again that @xmath57 is defined with respect to the energy of the corresponding background solution and has no absolute meaning .",
    "hence , unlike q - balls , it is not possible to select a universal ground energy level from which one can count the energy of q - holes ( this reasoning holds for q - bulges as well ) . instead",
    ", the energy of each q - hole ( q - bulge ) must be renormalized in a unique way . as for q - bulges , @xmath60 in this case , leading to @xmath61 .",
    "we would like to point out once again that , although @xmath62 , the original potential @xmath43 may not have zero derivatives everywhere except the origin . therefore , in general , the asymptotes of q - holes ( q - bulges ) do not approach any false vacuum state , contrary to what our intuition says about the properties of solitons .",
    "in this section we consider the model allowing for analytical investigation of the scalar condensate and q - holes . for this purpose",
    "it is convenient to choose a simple piecewise - parabolic potential of the model @xcite , @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 is the heaviside step function with the convention @xmath69 . the potential ( [ potential ] )",

    "in this paper we have presented q - holes and q - bulges  two classes of localized configurations representing dips and rises in the spatially - homogeneous charged time - dependent scalar condensate .",
    "the important feature of these configurations is that they can be deformed into the condensate by a finite amount of energy .",
    "we expect that inhomogeneities of this type may be crucial for the nonlinear dynamics of the condensate in the early universe , in particular , for its fragmentation into q - balls .",
    "we have also found the explicit solutions for q - holes in the model with a simple piecewise - parabolic potential proposed in @xcite , and examined their properties .",
    "it has been shown that the renormalized energy @xmath57 of q - holes can take both positive , zero and negative values .    in this paper , we did not address in detail the question of quantum stability of q - holes and q - bulges .",
    "of course , if `` ordinary '' particles interact with q - holes and q - bulges through , say , the combination @xmath192 ( which is time - independent for these solutions and for the scalar condensate ) , q - bulges and q - holes with @xmath61 can decay into such particles .",
    "moreover , one may expect that q - bulges and q - holes can be created ( even spontaneously ) in processes involving these particles .",
    "so , this case is rather standard .",
    "however , the case of excitations of the scalar field @xmath1 above the condensate , which are supposed to form the corresponding scalar particles , is not so trivial . for ordinary q - balls one can define a standard vacuum far from the core of the soliton and apply a standard quantization procedure to the perturbations above this vacuum . for the time - dependent scalar condensate ,",
    "excitations on top of the background have nonstandard dispersion laws like the one in eq .",
    "( [ excitdispl ] ) .",
    "moreover , one can check that even the charge of the excitation with respect to the condensate charge also has a very nonstandard form , and the standard quantization procedure can not be applied to such excitations .",
    "it would be interesting to see what should be defined as `` particles '' related to the excitations of the form ( [ pertback ] ) on top of the time - dependent background , and what must be the consistent quantization procedure , providing us with the correct definition of energy of the quantum excitations .",
    "these questions call for further detailed investigation .",
    "we would like to thank d.s .",
