    "the results presented in figures  [ f - pd ] , [ f - chicken ] and [ f - bos ] are comparable to the results for different levels of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "they are also consistent with the results of chen and co - workers  @xcite who show that with increasing decoherence the payoffs to both players approach the average of the four payoffs in a quantum prisoners dilemma .",
    "a simple effect of decoherence can be seen in meyer s quantum penny - flip  @xcite between p , who is restricted to classical strategies , and q , who has access to quantum operations . in the classical game , p places a coin heads up in a box . first q , then p , then q again , have the option of ( secretly ) flipping the coin or leaving it unaltered , after which the state of the coin is revealed .",

    "the coin is replaced by a qubit prepared in the @xmath0 ( `` heads '' ) state .",
    "having access to quantum operations , q applies the hadamard operator to produce the superposition @xmath95 . this state is invariant under the transformation @xmath96",
    "so p s action has no effect . on his second move",
    "q again applies the hadamard operator to return the qubit to @xmath0 .",
    "thus q wins with certainty against any classical strategy by p.    decoherence can be added to this model by applying a measurement with probability @xmath16 after q s first move . applying the same operation after p s move",
    "has the same effect since his move is either the identity or a bit - flip .",
    "if the initial state of the coin is represented by the density matrix @xmath97 , the final state can be calculated by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the hadamard operator , @xmath100 is p s move ( @xmath61 or @xmath101 ) , and @xmath102 is a measurement in the computational basis with probability @xmath16 .",
    "again , the final state is independent of p s move .",
    "the expectation of q winning decreases linearly from one to @xmath103 as @xmath16 goes from zero to one .",
    "maximum decoherence produces a fair game .    as an example of the effect of decoherence on another quantum game consider a game analogous to a three player duel , or truel , between alice , bob and charles  @xcite .",
    "the classical version can be described as follows .",
    "each player has a bit , starting in the one state .",
    "the players move in sequence in alphabetic order .",
    "a move consists of either doing nothing or attempting to flip an opponent s bit with a known probability of failure of @xmath104 , @xmath105 or @xmath106 , for alice , bob and charles , respectively",
    ". a player can do nothing if their bit is zero .",
    "the payoffs at the completion of the game are 1/(number of bits in the one state ) to a player whose bit is one , or zero otherwise .",
    "( the connection with a truel is made by considering one to correspond to `` alive '' and zero to `` dead '' .",
    "a move is an attempt to shoot an opponent . )",
    "in some situation the optimal strategy is counter - intuitive",
    ". it may be beneficial for a player to do nothing rather than attempt to flip an opponent s bit from one to zero , since if they are successful they become the target for the third player .",
    "the game is quantized by replacing the players bits by qubits and by replacing the flip operation by an su(2 ) operator of the form of equation  ( [ e - qstrategy ] ) operating on the chosen qubit .",
    "maintaining coherence throughout the game removes the dynamic aspect since the players can get no information on the success of previous moves .",
    "noise can be added to the quantum game by giving a probability @xmath16 of a measurement being made after each move , and in the case of a measurement , allowing the players to choose their strategy depending on the result of previous rounds , which are now known .",
    "figure  [ f - truel ] shows the regions of the parameter space @xmath107 corresponding to alice s preferred strategy in a one round truel when @xmath108 ( i.e. , when charles is always successful ) .",
    "the boundary between alice maximizing her expected payoff by doing nothing and by targeting charles depends on the decoherence probability @xmath16 .",
    "we see a smooth transition from the quantum case to the classical as @xmath16 goes from zero to one .",
    "note that the boundary in the parameter space changes from linear in the classical case to convex in the quantum case .",
    "this is of interest since convexity is being intensely studied as the basis for parrondo s paradox  @xcite and the current example may provide an opportunity for generating a quantum parrondo s paradox  @xcite .",
    "a method of introducing decoherence into quantum games has been presented .",
    "one measure of the `` quantum - ness '' of a quantum game subject to decoherence is the advantage a quantum player has over a player restricted to classical strategies .",
    "as expected , increasing the amount of decoherence degrades the advantage of the quantum player .",
    "however , in the model considered , this advantage does not entirely disappear until the decoherence is a maximum .",
    "when this occurs in a @xmath43 symmetric game , the results of the players are equal .",
    "the classical game is not reproduced .",
    "the loss of advantage to the quantum player is very similar to that which occurs when the level of entanglement between the players qubits is reduced .",
    "in the example of a one - round quantum truel , increasing the level of decoherence altered the regions of parameter space corresponding to different preferred strategies smoothly toward the classical regions . in this quantum game ,",
    "maximum decoherence produces a situation identical to the classical game .    in multi - player quantum games",
    "it is known that new nash equilibria can arise  @xcite .",
    "the effect of decoherence on the existence of the new equilibria is an interesting open question .",
    "there has been some work on continuous - variable quantum games  @xcite involving an infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
