    "various cosmological models @xcite have been suggested to explain the accelerated expansion of the late universe @xcite . for example , a cosmological constant @xmath1 can be added to the friedmann and acceleration equations in the @xmath1cdm ( lambda cold dark matter ) model .",
    "although the @xmath1cdm model is widely accepted , it suffers from several theoretical difficulties , such as the cosmological constant problem @xcite . to resolve them",
    ", a time - varying @xmath4 cosmology has been proposed , called the @xmath5cdm model @xcite .",
    "an extra constant term is obtained from the integration of the renormalization group equation for the vacuum energy density @xcite . as a result , the standard @xmath1cdm model is actually one kind of @xmath5cdm model .",
    "a similar constant term appears in the ccdm ( creation of cold dark matter ) models @xcite , which assume that irreversible entropy is generated from gravitationally induced particle creation @xcite .",
    "in addition , a constant term can also appear in viscous models @xcite , if the bulk viscosity of the cosmological fluid is inversely proportional to the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "in fact , both the creation of cold dark matter and the bulk viscosity can generate entropy in a homogeneous and isotropic universe @xcite .",
    "consequently , the friedmann equation does not include an extra driving term , whereas the acceleration equation includes one due to dissipation , namely @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are drivers for the friedmann and acceleration equations , respectively .    in @xmath5cdm models ,",
    "extra driving terms are given by @xmath10 , without having to assume any dissipation .",
    "interestingly , several forms of entropy have been proposed for the @xmath5cdm model .",
    "for example , an entropic - force model has been examined from several viewpoints @xcite . in that model , an entropic - force term ( corresponding to an extra driver )",
    "can be derived from the ( usually neglected ) surface terms on the horizon of the universe @xcite , without introducing new fields or dark energies . instead of dark energy ,",
    "the entropic - force model assumes that the horizon of the universe has a definite entropy and temperature @xcite .",
    "the most common entropic - force model is considered to be a particular case of @xmath5cdm models @xcite , so that the assumed entropy is reversible , such as the entropy related to the reversible exchange of energy @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "other workers have proposed an entropic - force model similar to the ccdm and bulk viscous models , i.e. , with @xmath6 , as if irreversible entropy is assumed @xcite .",
    "entropic - force models can therefore be categorized into two main types @xcite : @xmath11 and @xmath6 .",
    "these two types correspond to @xmath12 ( nondissipative ) and @xmath13 ( fully dissipative ) , respectively , and have been systematically investigated @xcite . however , a more general dissipative universe ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) has not yet been analyzed .",
    "accordingly , the present paper extends the entropic - force model in order to closely examine a dissipative universe .",
    "specifically , a phenomenological model is considered that includes constant entropic - force terms .",
    "a constant term is expected to play an important role not only in @xmath4cdm models @xcite but also in entropic - force models @xcite . the constant term is also related to @xmath1cdm and ccdm models .",
    "the present study bridges the gap between the @xmath1cdm ( @xmath12 ) and ccdm ( @xmath13 ) models .",
    "furthermore , density perturbations are expected to be influenced by the dissipation rate , even if the background evolution of the universe remains the same .",
    "therefore , density perturbations in the modified entropic - force model are examined that includes a constant term for various dissipation rates .",
    "note that the entropic - force discussed here is essentially different from the idea that gravity itself is an entropic force @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
