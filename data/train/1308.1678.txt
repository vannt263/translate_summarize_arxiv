    "the extreme luminosities of qsos make them effective tracers of black hole growth over most of the universe s history ( @xmath4 ) and likewise illuminate the evolution of galaxies and large - scale structure over these cosmological epochs and volumes .",
    "in particular , the mass of supermassive black holes is tightly correlated with properties of their host galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , while qso clustering properties are well - matched to the expected distribution of dark matter in and out of halos ( e.g. @xcite ) according to the cosmological standard model .",
    "however , the manner in which qsos populate and interact with galaxies and dark - matter halos is obscured by the unknown timescales and geometries over which black holes accrete mass and produce substantial radiation .",
    "specifically , the fraction of black holes that can be observed as qsos depends sensitively on the length of their active phases and whether their emission is isotropic or confined to a narrow solid angle . a short qso lifetime ( @xmath5 ) and/or a small opening angle ( @xmath6 )",
    "would indicate that observed qsos comprise a small fraction of the total population of black holes ( and therefore galaxies and dark - matter halos ) that will pass through a qso phase .",
    "furthermore , both the comparison of @xmath5 to a typical star - formation timescale @xmath7 myr and the value of @xmath6 have deep implications for the mechanisms by which the qso couples to the ism in galaxies and produces feedback .",
    "current estimates of @xmath5 utilize numerous methods , many of which are described in detail in a review by @xcite , and in general allow for qso lifetimes in the range @xmath8 yr @xmath9 yr . in the last decade , measurements of the qso luminosity function and clustering have provided particularly powerful constraints on a globally - averaged @xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite ) , but they also rely on the poorly - constrained black hole mass function or assume that the most luminous qsos populate the most massive halos , contrary to some observations and physically - motivated models ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these global measures of @xmath5 are also degenerate between single - phase qso accretion ( in which the bulk of activity occurs in a single event ) and multi - burst models ( in which the same total time in a qso phase is distributed over many short accretion events ) .",
    "more direct measurements of @xmath5 may be obtained from the effect of qso radiation on their local enviroments",
    ". measures of the transverse proximity effect use the volumes ( and associated light - travel times ) over which bright qsos ionize their nearby gas and have yielded estimates or lower limits in the range @xmath10 myr by tracing ( e.g. @xcite ) and metal - line @xcite absorption systems .",
    "the detection of fluorescent ly@xmath0  emission provides another direct measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "fluorescent ly@xmath0  arises from the reprocessing of ionizing photons ( either from the metagalactic uv background or a local qso ) at the surfaces of dense , neutral clouds of .",
    "this effect has been modeled with increasing complexity over the last few decades @xcite and has now been observed around bright qsos ( @xcite ; trainor et al .",
    "2013 , in prep . ) .",
    "these detections have verified the feasibility of identifying fluorescent emission from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and suggested a wide opening angle @xmath6 of qso emission ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "they are consistent with other constraints on @xmath5 , but have been limited by small sample sizes and/or a lack of the 3d spatial information necessary to probe the spatial variation of the qso radiation field in detail .",
    "this paper presents results from a large survey of ly@xmath0  emitters ( laes ) in fields surrounding hyperluminous ( @xmath11 l@xmath12 ) qsos at redshifts @xmath13 .",
    "the full results of this survey , including a detailed analysis of the ly@xmath0  emission mechanisms and physical properties of the laes , will be presented in trainor et al .",

    "hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "this paper focuses on the implications of these data for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "observations and the data are briefly discussed in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] ; identification of fluorescent sources is discussed in  [ subsec : fluor ] ;",
    "constraints on @xmath5 and @xmath6 appear in  [ subsec : tdelay]@xmath14[subsec : theta ] ; and conclusions are given in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . a standard cosmology with @xmath15 km s@xmath16 and @xmath17 is assumed throughout , and distances are given in physical units ( e.g. pmpc ) .",
    "we conducted deep imaging in each survey field using custom narrow - band filters and corresponding broad - band filters sampling the continuum near ly@xmath0  with keck 1/lris - b over several years ; these data are described in paper ii .",
    "all 8 fields are part of the keck baryonic structure survey ( kbss ; @xcite ; steidel et al .",
    "2013 , in prep . )",
    "we used 1 of 4 narrow - band filters to image each of the 8 qso fields ( centered on or near the qso ) ; a brief description of the fields and corresponding filters is given in table [ table : fields ] .",
    "each filter has a fwhm @xmath18  and a central wavelength tuned to ly@xmath0  at the redshift of one or more of the hyperluminous qsos .",
    "the qsos span a redshift range @xmath19 , and the filter width corresponds to @xmath20 or @xmath21 km s@xmath16 at their median redshift .",
    "the narrow - band images have total integration times of 5 - 7 hours and reach a depth for point sources of @xmath22 ; the continuum images are typically deeper by @xmath23 mag .",
    "object identification and narrow - band and continuum magnitude measurements were performed with sextractor .",
    "the success rate of our initial follow - up spectroscopy dropped sharply above @xmath24 , so our laes are selected to have @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( corresponding to a rest - frame equivalent width in ly@xmath0  @xmath27 ) .",
    "these criteria define a set of 841 laes .",
    "the laes range from unresolved / compact to extremely extended ( fwhm @xmath28 ) sources .",
    "the extended objects require large photometric apertures that may enclose unassociated continuum sources ; in order to avoid the complication of determining the true continuum counterparts of these sources , laes with fwhm @xmath29 were removed from our sample for this analysis , leaving a final photometric sample of 816 laes .",
    "spectra were obtained with keck 1/lris - b in the multislit mode using the 600/4000 grism ; the spectral resolution near ly@xmath0for these spectra is @xmath30 .",
    "redshifts were measured via an automated algorithm described in paper ii ; the detected ly@xmath0  lines have a minimum snr @xmath31 3.5 and a median snr @xmath31 15 .",
    "detected lines were required to lie at a wavelength where the transmission exceeds 10% for the narrow - band filter used to select their associated candidates ( typically a @xmath31110  range ) , but no other prior was used to constrain the automatic line detection .",
    "redshifts were measured for 260 of the laes meeting our final photometric criteria ; these comprise the spectroscopic sample used in this paper .",
    "qso redshifts were determined as described in @xcite and have estimated uncertainties @xmath32 km s@xmath16 .",
    "ly@xmath0  emission is subject to complex radiative - transfer effects and is ubiquitous in star - forming galaxies , so accurate discrimination between fluorescence and other ly@xmath0  emission mechanisms is key to its use as a qso probe ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a powerful tool in this regard is the rest - frame equivalent width of ly@xmath0  ( @xmath33 ) , which has a natural maximum in star - forming sources because the same massive stars produce the uv continuum and the ionizing photons that are reprocessed as ly@xmath0  emission .",
    "empirically , uv - continuum - selected galaxies at @xmath34 almost never exhibit @xmath35  @xcite , which is also the maximum value expected for continuous star - formation lasting @xmath36 yr or longer @xcite .",
    "this threshold may demarcate the realm of fluorescence from that of typical star - forming galaxies .",
    "furthermore , models of star - formation in the extreme limits of metallicity and short bursts predict a stringent limit of @xmath37   ( see @xcite and discussion in @xcite ) for even the most atypical star - forming galaxies .",
    "the distribution of @xmath33 and @xmath38 for the laes are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nbma ] .",
    "observed - frame equivalent widths ( @xmath39 ) were measured from the narrow - band color excess while accounting for the presence of ly@xmath0  within the continuum filter bandpass ; details of this procedure are given in paper ii .",
    "@xmath33 is estimated from @xmath39 by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the redshift of the associated hyperluminous qso .",
    "[ fig : nbma ] demonstrates that many of our laes exceed both the model and empirical thresholds for the maximum @xmath33 consistent with pure star formation : of the 816 laes , 116 exceed @xmath42  and 32 exceed @xmath43 .",
    "we consider these high-@xmath33 sources as excellent candidates to be fluorescence - dominated , with minimal stellar contribution to their ly@xmath0  flux .",
    "the presence of a fluorescent emitter indicates that its local volume element was illuminated by ionizing qso radiation at the lookback time @xmath44 when the observed ly@xmath0  photon was emitted . depending on whether the fluorescent source lies in the foreground or background of the qso",
    ", @xmath44 may be greater or less than @xmath45 , the lookback time to the qso itself .",
    "however , this fluorescent ly@xmath0  photon was generated by the reprocessing of an ionizing qso photon emitted a time @xmath46 before @xmath44 , where @xmath46 is the light - travel time from the qso to the emitter .",
    "it is geometrically trivial to show that @xmath47 , and we can define the delay time for an emitter at a vector position @xmath48 :    @xmath49    it can likewise be shown that the locus of points for which @xmath50 is constant forms a paraboloid pointed toward the observer with the qso at the focal point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zcombo ] , top , for a pictorial representation at varying values of @xmath50 ) .",
    "the significance of such a delay surface can be seen by considering a simple , step - function model of qso emission in which the ionizing emission was zero a time @xmath5 before we observe the qso and has been constant since that time .",
    "under such a model , the ionizing field is zero for @xmath51 , and the spatial distribution of fluorescent emitters must be restricted to the interior of the paraboloid defined by @xmath52 .    since the high-@xmath33 laes described in  [ subsec : fluor ] are highly likely to be dominated by fluorescence , they represent the best tracers of the qso ionizing field .",
    "below , we use the distribution of these sources to set limits on @xmath5 .",
    "the geometry of our survey volume is such that we can probe long timescales",
    "@xmath53 yr @xmath54 yr@xmath55 via the line - of - sight distribution of sources ( see red box in fig .",
    "[ fig : zcombo ] , top ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath33 vs. @xmath56 for the 260 laes with measured redshifts is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : zcombo ] ( middle ) , where @xmath56 is the hubble distance of each emitter from its associated hyperluminous qso determined from the difference of emitter and qso redshifts .    due to the effects of redshifts errors and peculiar velocities among the laes and qsos , our foreground / background discrimination breaks down at @xmath57 km s@xmath16 , corresponding to @xmath58 pmpc and @xmath59 myr ; we are therefore unable to constrain @xmath5 lower than 20 myr based on the redshift distribution of sources . at @xmath60 myr",
    ", however , there is a significant paucity of high-@xmath33 sources : only four sources with @xmath42lie in this range , and there are none at @xmath61 myr .",
    "this suggests @xmath62 myr for these fields ; we evaluate the significance of this result via numerical tests below .",
    "the non - uniform redshift coverage of our qso fields complicates the analysis of @xmath56 ; the observed redshift distribution is modulated by the narrow - band filter bandpass and the distribution of large - scale structure along the qso line of sight .",
    "in addition , the qso redshifts are not perfectly centered in their filter bandpasses , which contributes part of the observed asymmetry .",
    "fortunately , the distribution of star - forming galaxies presumably represented by our @xmath63  laes trace all of these effects , and we can use their redshift distribution to determine the expected distribution of emitters in the absence of fluorescence .",
    "we use the entire sample of emitters with spectroscopic redshifts and @xmath63  for this comparison .",
    "firstly , we utilize the two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test , a measure of the probability that two samples of observations are drawn from the same parent distribution . evaluating the test on the distributions of @xmath64@xmath55 and @xmath65@xmath55 yields a ks statistic @xmath66 , corresponding to @xmath67 .",
    "there are insufficient emitters with redshift measurements to perform the test on the higher - threshold ( @xmath43 ) sample with significance .",
    "a disadvantage of the two - sample ks test is that it is most sensitive to differences that occur near the center of two distributions , whereas we expect the strongest deviation in these distributions at large @xmath56 , where no fluorescent emitters would appear if @xmath68 myr .",
    "for this reason , we conducted a monte - carlo test in which subsamples of the @xmath63laes were randomly selected ( with replacement ) , where each subsample has 67 objects , the number of @xmath42  emitters with spectroscopic redshifts in our actual sample .",
    "for each subsample , the number of sources with @xmath69 pmpc ( corresponding to @xmath70 myr ) was counted .",
    "as noted above , only four sources with @xmath42  exceed @xmath71 pmpc . in @xmath72",
    "simulated subsamples , 40 had three or fewer objects with @xmath69 pmpc , yielding a significance @xmath73 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the 7 qsos with spectroscopic follow - up ( ie .",
    "all except q2343 + 12 ) are consistent with @xmath68 myr ( approximately the lowest it can be measured unambiguously from our redshift measurements )",
    ".      while the redshift distribution is not sensitive for probing shorter qso lifetimes , sufficiently small values of @xmath5 will affect the projected distribution of sources in the survey volume .",
    "in particular , the constant-@xmath50 paraboloids for @xmath74 myr are well matched to the geometry of our survey volume ( see curves on the left side of fig . [",
    "fig : zcombo ] , top ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig : rcombo ] shows the correspondence of these surfaces ( shown for @xmath75 yr @xmath76 yr ) to the radial distribution of @xmath33 for the entire photometric sample ( note that the survey geometry is not to scale , unlike in fig .",
    "[ fig : zcombo ] ) . as above ,",
    "a qso with @xmath77 will produce fluorescent emission only within the corresponding paraboloid . for @xmath78 myr",
    ", this would produce a maximum projected distance ( @xmath79 ) at which a fluorescent emitter could appear in our survey volume .",
    "for @xmath80 myr @xmath81 myr , the fractional volume of the survey within the time - delay surface decreases with increasing @xmath79 , predicting that the probability of a given emitter exhibiting fluorescence will likewise decrease with @xmath79 .    notably , the projected distribution of laes is well - populated by objects with @xmath42  and those with @xmath43  out to the largest values of @xmath79 probed by our survey , thus firmly ruling out lifetimes @xmath78 myr .",
    "furthermore , the radial distributions of sources with @xmath42  and @xmath82are entirely consistent when subjected to a two sample ks test ( @xmath83 ; @xmath84 ) ; the null result is similar using the @xmath85  threshold .",
    "given the large number of objects in our photometric sample ( @xmath86 ) , these data provide strong evidence that @xmath87 myr for the qsos in our sample .      for @xmath88 , a substantial fraction of the survey volume at large @xmath79 will be inaccessible to the ionizing emission of the qso , which will affect the distribution of @xmath79 for fluorescent sources similarly to @xmath89 myr .",
    "we can probe @xmath6 in detail through the 2d spatial distribution of those high-@xmath33 laes with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "it is easily seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcombo ] ( top ) that the high-@xmath33 laes ( red and orange points ) extend to large projected radii at or near the qso redshift , suggesting that ionizing emission is emanating from the qso nearly perpindicularly to the line of sight ( ie . with @xmath90 ) . in reality ,",
    "redshift errors and peculiar velocities prohibit us from establishing the line - of - sight distance of an lae from the qso to be less than 3 pmpc ( see  [ subsec : zdist ] ) , so these data ( with a 2 pmpc projected range ) provide the constraint @xmath91 .",
    "we have presented constraints on the lifetime and opening angle of ionizing qso emission based on a large photometric / spectroscopic survey of laes in the regions around hyperluminous qsos ( described in detail in paper ii ) , finding 1 myr @xmath92 20 myr and @xmath93 .",
    "these results are consistent with the most of the literature discussed in  [ sec : intro ] ; in particular , our estimate of @xmath5 falls at the short end of the broad range allowed by the measurements reviewed in @xcite and is similar to the transverse proximity effect measurements of @xcite , which included a qso of comparable luminosity to those in this sample .",
    "perhaps most significantly , @xmath5 measured here is short compared to the @xmath94-folding timescale of @xcite : @xmath95 myr for a qso with @xmath96 and a radiative efficiency @xmath97 .",
    "unless these qsos have @xmath98 or are accreting with a low radiative efficiency ( neither of which is expected for luminous qsos ) , then these observed hyperluminous accretion events do not dominate the accretion history of their central black holes .",
