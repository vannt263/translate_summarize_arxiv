    "quantum computation and quantum information are modern developments taking advantage from the quantum mechanics features to propose technological applications . in their quantum gate version , the gate construction on specific physical systems is a central aspect to develop those applications .",
    "the requirement of entanglement as resource implies the introduction of physical interactions between the parts of the system .",
    "this requirement introduces in the dynamics other natural basis than computational basis , which is only natural for single and isolated qubits . for this reason , in general , it is not easy fit the evolution into the theoretical gate constructions inspired on the classical computational elements @xcite .",
    "the same is true for more complex gates involving multiqubit systems .",
    "thus , several attempts to define general ways to construct gates are in order .",
    "these approaches uses unitary factorization , asymptotic approximations , etc .",
    "@xcite . still the most common approach is the construction of universal sets of gates whose composition lets to generate any other gate .    in this work ,",
    "we propose and develop a set of universal gates easily constructed for bipartite magnetic systems ruled by the anysotropic heisenberg - ising interaction including driven magnetic fields in the @xmath0 directions ( @xmath1 ) :    @xmath2",
    "this model comprises several models reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "their @xmath3 dynamics exhibits a block form when it is expressed on the non - local basis of bell states @xcite . as it has been proved , the general blocks in that decomposition has the form @xmath4 :    @xmath5    where @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the direction of magnetic field and @xmath8 a position label for each block in the whole evolution matrix .",
    "@xmath9 are the labels for its rows . there ,",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 are a set of extended pauli matrices stating a basis for each @xmath12 block @xmath13 applied on definite pairs of selectable bell states as function of @xmath7 .",
    "this basis could be understood too as noise or error basis for deviations from the evolution prescriptions ( such as the traditional @xmath14 and @xmath15 are noise effects in the computational basis , dephasing and flipping noise ) .",
    "the parameters :    @xmath16    are related with the reduced transversal strength and magnetic fields @xmath17 and with the rabi frequencies involved @xmath18 , as they are presented in @xcite . at the same time , these parameters are finally expressed in terms of the physical parameters @xmath19 .",
    "thus @xmath20 , stating a semi - direct product @xmath21 for @xmath22 with the bell states as general basis for all cases @xmath1 .",
    "this dynamics mixes the selectable pairs of bell states in a programmed way .",
    "thus , in this work we explode last property to show that an alternative set of universal gates can be easily constructed .",
    "these gates operate on these subspaces defined by the pairs of bell states as a privileged grammar instead or alternatively to the computational basis ( through the block forms depicted there ) .",
    "the second section presents the boykin et al universal gates and the proposed alternative gates for the current systems .",
    "the third section shows the prescriptions to generate the set of universal gates , discussing some possible issues .",
    "the fourth section presents a general strategy to evaluate the performance for all gates proposed .",
    "last section states the conclusions and extensions .",
    "it has been shown that two level quantum channel processing is universal in the quantum gate version of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "in addition , a universal set of two level gates for the computational basis was given by boykin et al @xcite : @xmath23 ( table 1 ) .",
    "boykin et al gates are really universal for @xmath24 operations on quantum information , independently from the basis being used .",
    "then , their form can be used for another arbitrary basis on two levels where quantum computation is being settled . for the bell states basis ,",
    "an analog set of gates could be alternative to the last universal set .",
    "these gates operates on the entire quantum information space of the bipartite system : @xmath25 .",
    "gate subscript remarks that those forms are written for the bell basis .",
    "thus , they need be considered covering the two quantum channels simultaneously . for this reason , the graph of any gate in @xmath26 comprises always the two channels ( table 2 ) . in particular , the classical symbol for @xmath27 gate appears horizontally ( as a symbolic issue ) in the corresponding graphs , due to they are controlled with respect to the quantum information states , not with respect to the single qubit states .",

    "@xmath40 gate includes @xmath29 and @xmath32 gates for the corresponding values of @xmath41 . in particular note",
    "that @xmath42 works as a translator between the computational and the bell basis , closing the equivalence with the @xmath43 set .",
    "the relevant aspect is the simple construction of these gates for the current hamiltonian in this work .",
    "at the first glance , one can see the correspondence between their block structure of @xmath26 elements and the general block in ( [ sector ] ) . in the next section we state the main concrete prescriptions for each gate .",

    "thus , clearly @xmath60 and each @xmath61 is some gate expressed in bell basis , a gate operating on two levels and then able to be expressed ( at least asymptotically @xcite ) as a product of elements of @xmath26 : @xmath62 .",

    ". some variations could be possible or necessary , but last prescriptions resume the general conditions to reproduce the universal gates set @xmath26 on the bell states . due to the extension of these prescriptions",
    "they are omitted here .",
    "@xmath85 corresponds always to the first block @xmath86 .",
    "note particularly than prescriptions for @xmath44 could be used to generate @xmath46 too when @xmath87 is changed by @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( as for other gates ) .",
    "nevertheless , we report in the table 1 an easier implementation for @xmath87 .",
    "condition @xmath90 is optional , but it has been used in the current analysis , indicating the necessity to increase sufficiently the magnetic field on the qubits to approach the evolution matrix asymptotically to @xmath91 .",
    "in order to round the gates proposal , an strategy to evaluate their performance should be delivered .",
    "thus , to set a stability degree for each element of the universal set @xmath26 , we consider the initial multipartite state ( bipartite is sufficient for our purposes ) :    @xmath92    which is explicitly exhibiting the direct sum structure of the hilbert space in the current case .",
    "note that @xmath93 is the basis being used in the representation ( some arrangement of bell states , dependent on @xmath7 in our case ) , with each element labeled by the block @xmath94 and a label @xmath13 for each element of the pair . under the effect of some gate on @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the @xmath4 block ( [ sector ] ) .",
    "here , @xmath7 is an additional label identifying different decompositions and arrangements of @xmath93 ( the direction in which the control field is applied , in our case ) and @xmath94 is the block number .",
    "then , the transformed state @xmath97 under the gate @xmath98 is :    @xmath99    now , we are interested in a tiny failure in the gate prescriptions , generating an alternative effect but very near from the proposed gate , @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is a tiny variation of @xmath96 generated by the variation of some of their parameter prescriptions @xmath102 ( @xmath103 in our case ) .",

    "@xmath106    and if @xmath107 , then :    @xmath108    developing the last expression using ( [ derivada ] ) and considering @xmath109 , it gives :    @xmath110    outstandingly , @xmath111 depends quadratically from @xmath112 , a property due to @xmath113 is unitary .",
    "this expression set a procedure to evaluate the performance of any element in @xmath26 for any state @xmath104 being processed around of their specific prescriptions given in the table 3 .",
    "this task implies evaluate @xmath111 for each gate in @xmath26 and any state @xmath104 in the hilbert space @xmath114 .",
    "exact control for time independent magnetic fields has been used here to reduce the evolution blocks to pertinent blocks to reproduce the gates @xmath26 alternative to @xmath43 , but other kinds of control ( optimal , non - resonant , etc . )",
    "could be introduced @xcite , whose control schemes are well known for the @xmath12 dynamics . more achievable forms for magnetic fields pulses are in order to reproduce the proposed gates , particularly avoiding resonance effects .",
    "nevertheless gate fidelity has been theoretically quantified , additional concrete research is necessary to analyze this fidelity for the current constructions when the prescriptions are slightly modified due to the main uncontrollable factors . in particular , as time and strength of magnetic fields are currently well controlled @xcite , possibly the most sensible factors in the model are the strengths @xmath115 for the non - local interactions in the heisenberg - ising model @xcite .",
    "a complete analysis based on the formula ( [ f2 ] ) for each gate is currently in progress .",
    "this proposal is based on bell states instead of single qubits states , which are technologically a challenge in terms of experimental stability and coherence . despite",
    ", this states appears as better candidates to set a computational grammar on magnetic systems easing quantum control and quantum gate engineering .",
    "in addition , the approach is clearly settled on the quantum information manipulation more than in the physical systems where it lays .",
