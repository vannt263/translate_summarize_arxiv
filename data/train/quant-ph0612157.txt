    "quantum cloning plays an important role in quantum information and quantum communication .",
    "it has been shown that quantum cloning might improve the performance of some computational tasks @xcite and it is believed to be the optimal eavesdropping attack for a certain class of quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "it also opens an avenue for understanding the concepts of quantum mechanics and measurement theory further .",
    "so the quantum cloning which achieves the optimal cloning transformation compatible with the quantum no cloning theorem has always being a hot research topic .",
    "such a quantum cloning machine was first considered by buzek and hillery for qubits @xcite and later extended to the continuous - variable ( cv ) regime by cerf et al .",
    "cv quantum cloning has been extensively studied in the recent years for the relative ease in preparing and manipulating quantum states .",
    "the theoretical proposals for the experimental implementations of cv quantum cloning have been proposed @xcite .",
    "a recent result in the context of measurement has revealed that more quantum information can be encoded in the antiparallel pairs of spins than parallel pairs @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a result that a pair of conjugate gaussian states can carry more information than by using the same states twice has been extended to continuous variables @xcite .",
    "this result makes it possible to yield better fidelity with the cloning machine admitting antiparallel input qubits or phase - conjugate input modes thereby opening a new avenue in the investigation of quantum cloning .",
    "based on the above properties , cerf and iblisdir put forward a cv cloning transformation @xcite that takes as input @xmath1 replicas of a coherent states and @xmath2 replicas of its complex conjugate , and produces @xmath0 optimal clones of the coherent state and @xmath3 phase - conjugate clones ( anticlones , or time reversed states ) .",
    "this is the first scheme for the phase - conjugate input ( pci ) cloner of continuous variables .",
    "it is , nonetheless , difficult for the practical experimental realization of the proposed pci cloner due to the difficulties associated with the physical implementation of the optical parametric amplifier .",
    "recently , a much simpler but efficient cv quantum cloning machine based on linear optics and homodyne detection was proposed and realized experimentally by andersen et al .",
    "later , this protocol is extended to various quantum cloning cases , such as asymmetric cloning @xcite and so on @xcite . according to classifying the quantum clone to irreversible and reversible types in the perspective of quantum information distribution @xcite , the quantum cloning with linear optics",
    "@xcite is local and irreversible , in which the anticlones are lost .",
    "perfect distribution do not allow losing any the quantum information of the transmitted unknown state , that means this process is reversible and the unknown state can be reconstructed in a quantum system again .    in this paper , we propose a protocol of cv quantum cloning of coherent states with phase - conjugate input modes using linear optics .",
    "the @xmath4 quantum cloning machine yields @xmath0 identical optimal clones from @xmath1 replicas of a coherent state and @xmath1 its replicas of phase conjugate .",
    "this scheme is regarded as local and irreversible pci quantum cloning because the anticlones are lost .",
    "we also show that @xmath4 irreversible pci quantum cloning machine may be changed into @xmath5 reversible pci quantum cloning machine by the introduction of an epr ( einstein - podolsky - rosen ) entangled ancilla .",
    "it shows that the optimal fidelity of the anticlones requires the maximally epr entangled state .",

    ", the quadrature operators can be expressed in terms of a steady state and fluctuating component as @xmath11 , which have variances of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "the input coherent state and its phase - conjugate state to be cloned will be described by @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the expectation values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the cloning machine generates many clones of input state characterized by the density operator @xmath21 and the expectation @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the quality of the cloning machine can be quantified by the fidelity , which a overlap between the input state and the output state .",
    "it is defined by @xcite    @xmath24   \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the case of unity gains , i.e. , @xmath25 , the fidelity is strongly peaked and changed into    @xmath26     irreversible pci quantum cloning .",

    "1 . the input coherent state @xmath28 and its phase - conjugate state @xmath29 are prepared by an amplitude modulator and a phase modulator respectively .",
    "the modulated signals on the amplitude modulators are in - phase and the modulated signals on the phase modulators are out  of - phase .",
    "the input mode @xmath28 is divided by a variable beam splitter with transmission rate @xmath30 and reflectivity rate @xmath31 .",
    "the reflected output @xmath32 , where the annihilation operator @xmath33 represents the vacuum mode entering the beam splitter , is combined with its phase - conjugate state @xmath34 at a 50/50 beam splitter",
    ". then we perform homodyne measurements on the two output beams to achieve the amplitude and the phase quadratures simultaneously .",
    "the measured quadratures are    @xmath35    we use the measurement outcomes to modulate the amplitude and phase of an auxiliary coherent beam via two independent modulators with a scaling factor @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this beam is then combined at a 99/1 beam splitter with the transmitted part of mode @xmath28 , hereby displacing this part according to the measurement outcomes @xcite .",
    "corresponding to the transformation @xmath37 in the heisenberg representation , the displaced field can be expressed as    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the annihilation operator for the displaced field . by choosing @xmath40",

    "( [ 2 ] )    @xmath59    this procedure is optimal clearly to produce @xmath0 clones .",
    "now we compare the fidelity of @xmath0 clones from the phase - conjugate input modes with from the two identical replicas .",
    "the fidelity of the standard 2-to - m cloning are given by @xcite    @xmath60    in the special case @xmath61 , the standard cloning can be achieved perfectly with fidelity equal to one while the phase - conjugate cloner yields an additional variance which will lead to a lower fidelity .",
    "it is , nonetheless , obvious that phase - conjugate cloner yields better fidelity than the standard cloning when @xmath62 . in the limit of large @xmath63",
    ", we could see @xmath64 compared with the standard cloning @xmath65 .",

    "our scheme loses the anticlones and is regarded as irreversible pci  quantum cloning .",
    "now we consider the realistic conditions where the homodyne detector efficiency is not unity .",
    "if @xmath66 expresses the homodyne detector efficiency , the measured amplitude and the phase quadratures are give by    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the vacuum noise introduced from the losses of the homodyne detector .",
