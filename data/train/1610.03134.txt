    "coronal ( or x - ray ) jets are collimated , transient eruptions of hot plasma observed predominantly in coronal holes and at the periphery of active regions , driven by flux emergence or cancellation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "`` standard jets '' are launched by reconnection between open magnetic fields and expanding closed fields , while the more energetic `` blowout jets '' additionally involve an eruption of the closed fields @xcite . for detailed descriptions of coronal jets",
    "see the recent reviews by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "coronagraph and in - situ observations revealed that coronal jets can produce signatures in the outer corona , sometimes even at earth or beyond @xcite .",
    "it was therefore suggested that they contribute to powering the corona and solar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "quantifying this contribution from observations is difficult , and only few attempts have been made so far .",
    "@xcite obtained a `` crude estimate '' for the energy budget of coronal jets , which was @xmath1 times smaller than required for maintaining the sw .",
    "@xcite suggested a mass - contribution of coronal jets to the sw of @xmath210% , though @xcite remarked that this value should be 2.5 times smaller . using heliospheric images from smei @xcite , @xcite estimated mass and energy contributions of 3.2% and 1.6% , respectively . finally , estimated the energy provided by coronal jets to be less than 1% of what is required to heat a polar coronal hole .",
    "they emphasized , though , that many high - temperature jets may be missed by the observations @xcite .",
    "thus , while it appears that the contribution of coronal jets to the sw may be small compared to the potential contribution by the much more numerous jet - like events on smaller scales @xcite , its exact amount remains uncertain .",
    "numerical models provide a powerful tool to address this question .",
    "however , mhd simulations of coronal jets were so far restricted to a limited treatment of the energy transfer in the corona and to heights far below the sw - acceleration region .",
    "recently , @xcite presented mhd simulations of coronal jets that overcame both limitations . using these simulations ,",
    "we evaluate here the mass and energy contribution of coronal jets to the sw , and compare our results to previous observational estimates .",
    "the simulations we use for our analysis are described in @xcite , and a more detailed account will be provided in a forthcoming publication ( trk _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) .",
    "they were performed using the 3d , viscous , resistive mhd model in spherical coordinates developed at predictive science inc . @xcite .",
    "the model incorporates thermal conduction parallel to the magnetic field , radiation losses , and parametric coronal heating .",

    ". a purely radial coronal magnetic field , produced by a magnetic monopole located at sun center is prescribed .",
    "starting from an initial thermodynamic sw - solution @xcite , we relax the system to a spherically symmetric , steady - state solar wind .",
    "afterwards , using the method of @xcite , we emerge a flux rope whose structure and evolution was previously computed with the model of @xcite .",

    "scaledwidth=47.7% ]    here we analyze three runs . in all cases ,",
    "the system is in a steady - state at @xmath11 , when the flux emergence is started . in our main run , _ jet 1 _ ,",
    "emergence is imposed for 4.5hrs , and the evolution is modeled for a total of 12hrs . the simulation produces a standard jet at @xmath12h , launched by the first strong occurrence of magnetic reconnection in the current layer that forms between the emerging flux and the open coronal field .",
    "several reconnection episodes follow , driven by the continuous expansion of the emerging flux rope . at @xmath13h a blowout jet is produced , associated with the eruption of the rope , which again is followed by several reconnection episodes , now occurring in the current layer that forms below the eruption .",
    "the blowout jet is much stronger than the standard jet , with a peak kinetic energy of @xmath14erg , compared to only @xmath15erg for the standard jet .",
    "plasma is ejected upwards by reconnection outflows during the jets , and additionally by the flux - rope eruption during the blowout jet .",
    "both jets produce alfvn waves , which travel much faster than the ejected plasma , due to the relatively large coronal alfvn speed in our model ( several 1000kms@xmath16 ) .    in figure[fig - jet1 ]",
    "we show manifestations of the jets in the outer corona , using synthetic difference - images of the polarization brightness @xcite and the magnitude of the elssser variable , @xmath17 , which represents an outward propagating alfvn perturbation along a radial magnetic field line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at @xmath18h an elongated brightness - enhancement and a clear wave - signature",
    "are visible in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the former is associated with plasma ejected by the standard jet , while the latter is associated with the alfvn wave triggered by the blowout jet ( the significantly weaker alfvn wave triggered by the standard jet has already left the field - of - view at this time ) . at @xmath19h",
    "the plasma ejected by the blowout jet becomes visible , while there are no strong wave - signatures anymore .",
    "the brightness - image shows density - enhancements and rarefactions , reminiscent of narrow coronal mass ejections and `` streamer blobs '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    our second run , _ jet 2 _ , has the same settings as _ jet 1 _ , but here we stop the flux emergence after 2hrs , so that only the standard jet occurs .",
    "this run is calculated for 6hrs . in both runs ohmic heating",
    "is included , so that magnetic energy dissipated through the resistivity ( corresponding to a resistive diffusion time @xmath20 hrs ) contributes to the energy equation . finally , in _ jet 3 _",
    ", we again impose the emergence for4.5 hrs , but turn off ohmic heating .",
    "an inspection of this run reveals that it is essentially a lower - energy version of _ jet 1 _ , so we stopped the calculation shortly after the occurrence of the blowout jet , at @xmath21h .     at @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , which contains the jet at all times . for our analysis",
    "we then select an area @xmath25 that corresponds to the jet s maximum transverse expansion .",
    ", scaledwidth=47.7% ]",
    "following @xcite and , we calculate the mass and energy fluxes associated with our jets , and integrate them in time and space to find the total mass and energy injected into the sw .",
    "different from these authors , we perform our analysis high in the corona , at @xmath10 , and use the poynting flux , rather than the wave - energy flux , for a more accurate calculation of the total energy flux (  [ ss : wave_vs_poynting ] ) . for the integration we use a spherical quadrangle @xmath26 at @xmath27 that contains the jet - signatures at all times ( figure[fig - flux ] ) .",
    "the area @xmath25 corresponds to the maximum lateral expansion of the blowout jet as it passes through @xmath26 at @xmath28h ( see figure  [ fig - jet1](c ) ) .",
    "we define @xmath25 as the area within which the perturbation in the sum of the kinetic and magnetic energies is larger than @xmath29 at that time . as in the above - mentioned papers , we consider the kinetic , potential , enthalpy , and wave energy fluxes : @xmath30 and the radial component of the poynting flux , @xmath31 fluxes due to radiation and thermal conduction are neglected . for each flux",
    "@xmath32 we determine the constant background @xmath33 produced by the steady - state sw ( which is zero for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "then we calculate the net power through @xmath26 due to the fluxes by integrating @xmath36 and removing the background : @xmath37 dividing each @xmath38 by @xmath25 , we obtain the average , background - subtracted energy fluxes associated with the jets as functions of time : @xmath39     for _ jet 13_. the magenta line shows the respective fluxes of the background solar wind . ]",
    "first we compare in figure  [ fig - poynting_wave ] the wave - energy flux with the radial poynting flux . for the former we use the transverse velocities and the magnetic field strength .",
    "we see that the wave - energy flux is always smaller than the poynting flux .",
    "in fact , the wave - energy flux formula assumes equipartition of ( perpendicular ) magnetic and kinetic energy , therefore missing some energy contribution when this condition does not fully apply .",
    "henceforth we use only the poynting flux to measure the wave energy injected into the sw .",
    "prior to the occurrence of the standard jet , no significant wave flux is transferred into the sw . as mentioned above ,",
    "alfvn waves launched low in the corona require only a few minutes to arrive at @xmath26 in our model .",
    "consequently , we see for all runs the first clear signal shortly after the first strong reconnection associated with the onset of the standard jet at @xmath40h .",
    "_ jet 2 _ , for which the flux emergence is terminated at @xmath41h , does not produce any significant signal afterwards . for _",
    "jet1 _ and _ jet3 _ , activity increases strongly shortly after @xmath42h , marking stronger reconnection episodes associated with the increasing expansion of the emerging flux rope prior to its eruption .",
    "the strongest peaks are around @xmath43h , when signals associated with the blowout jet arrive at @xmath26 . for _ jet1 _ , which was calculated for a longer time than _ jet3 _ ,",
    "the following decay phase contains two secondary peaks .",
    "the first one results from small reconnection events in the current sheet that forms below the erupting flux rope , while the second one may be related to a third jet that grows out of the flaring current sheet ( trk _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation )",
    ". the overall evolution of the poynting flux is very similar for _ jet1 _ and _ jet3 _ , suggesting a negligible influence of ohmic heating on the strength of the alfvn waves generated by reconnection .",
    "a clear deviation can be seen only during the strongest peak , which is associated also with the flux - rope eruption .",
    "figure[fig - f1_f2 ] shows @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 together with the background sw flux .",
    "_ jet 2 _ shows relatively weak activity , associated with plasma accelerated during the standard jet , which needs about 2hrs to arrive at @xmath26 .",
    "very similar activity is visible for _ jet 1 _ but much less for _ jet 3 _ , which lacks ohmic heating and produces weaker plasma upflows .",
    "an additional increase , coinciding with the major peak in the poynting flux ( figure  [ fig - poynting_wave](b ) ) , occurs in @xmath44 at @xmath47h for _ jet 1 _ and _ jet 3_. its absence in the other fluxes indicates that it is due to a ( transverse ) velocity increase rather than a density increase , as the alfvn wave associated with the blowout jet passes through @xmath26 . indeed , @xmath48 at this time , comparable to the background sw speed ( @xmath49 ) , while @xmath50 and @xmath51 increase by 10 and 30% at most , respectively . _ jet 1 _ then shows a strong increase of all fluxes for @xmath52h , when the blowout jet ( i.e. , the erupted flux rope ) passes through @xmath26 ( which at @xmath19 increases @xmath50 and @xmath51 by factors of up to 1.2 and 3.1 , respectively ) .",
    "the flux maxima ( @xmath19h ) are very similar and about one order of magnitude smaller than the peak poynting flux associated with the preceding alfvn wave ( cf .",
    "figure[fig - poynting_wave](b ) ) ; their ratios change if the analysis is performed at a different radius . ] . afterwards",
    "all fluxes show a strong oscillation and a final slow decay .",
    "the oscillation has similar amplitude for all fluxes , and is due to the density enhancements and rarefactions visible in figure[fig - jet1](c ) .",
    "all this activity is barely noticeable in the poynting flux ( @xmath53 = 28kms@xmath16 at @xmath19 , much smaller than at @xmath18 ) . for @xmath54h @xmath44 remains smaller than @xmath55 , since @xmath50 falls below the sw speed at @xmath56 once the ejecta has passed .          in order to compare our results with observational estimates , we calculate the mass and total energy injected during _",
    "jet 1 _ into the sw : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the average mass flux calculated from @xmath59 according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq - pt]-[eq - fbar ] ) .",
    "figure[fig - total ] shows the mass flux and the total energy flux as functions of time . to calculate @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    ", we extrapolate after @xmath62h the integrands to infinity and obtain @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the latter corresponding to @xmath21% of the magnetic - energy release during the blowout jet .",
    "@xmath60 equals the order - of - magnitude estimate obtained from uvcs observations at @xmath65 by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , both @xmath60 and @xmath61 are about one order of magnitude smaller than the mass and kinetic energy estimated by @xcite .    assuming that _ jet 1 _ represents an average coronal jet , a jet - occurrence frequency @xmath66 @xcite , and a fully open magnetic field at @xmath56",
    ", we obtain a total energy flux @xmath67 and a proton - density flux @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the proton mass and @xmath70 the spherical surface at @xmath56 . scaling these fluxes to 1 astronomical unit ( au ) , assuming spherical sw - expansion at constant speed",
    ", we get @xmath71 @xmath72 is significantly smaller than the 1au estimate @xmath73 by @xcite and @xcite and the correction by @xcite . ] .    in order to compare with the energy - flux estimate by , which was obtained for the low corona",
    ", we calculate @xmath74 for a typical height extension of coronal jets , @xmath75 @xcite , and employ the same assumptions for jet frequency and coronal hole area as those authors .",
    "we get @xmath76 , in very good agreement with their value @xmath77 .",
    "finally , we compare our results with sw fluxes derived from in - situ spacecraft measurements . according to @xcite , the total energy flux of the sw at 1au",
    "is @xmath21.5erg@xmath78s@xmath16 , and very similar for the slow and fast solar wind .",
    "the proton - density flux varies by a factor of about 2 between the slow and fast wind , and falls into the range @xmath79 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "comparing these values to our jet - produced fluxes scaled to 1au ( equation[eq:1au ] ) , we estimate that coronal jets provide @xmath80% and @xmath0% to the total energy and mass content of the sw , respectively .",
    "we used an mhd simulation with an advanced energy equation and a large spherical grid to estimate the mass and energy contributions of coronal jets to the sw . the simulation ( _ jet 1 _ ) produced both a standard and a blowout jet and included ohmic heating .",
    "we followed the previous , observational analysis by , except that we calculated mass and energy fluxes at @xmath27 rather than in the low corona , and used the poynting flux instead of the wave - energy flux to obtain the total energy flux .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the blowout jet produces a strong perturbation in the sw , the standard jet only to a minor one .",
    "this is not surprising , as the former is much more energetic than the latter in our simulation ( the peak kinetic energies differ by almost two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "such a large difference is in line with the results of @xcite , who estimated the magnetic energy released during a blowout jet to be about 2030 times larger than for a standard jet .",
    "\\(2 ) the blowout jet ( and associated flux - rope eruption ) triggers a strong alfvn wave that arrives at @xmath56 more than one hour before the ejecta .",
    "this significant lag is due to the relatively large coronal alfvn speed in our model , and is expected to decrease if more realistic values for the alfvn speed in coronal holes are chosen .",
    "the wave yields the dominant contribution to the poynting flux , while the contributions of alfvn waves triggered by the standard jet and by interim reconnection events remain relatively small .",
    "\\(3 ) the bulk kinetic energy , potential energy , and enthalpy fluxes are also dominated by the blowout jet .",
    "in contrast to the poynting flux , the evolution of these fluxes is characterized by a pronounced oscillation , which reflects plasma density enhancements and rarefactions associated with the eruption .",
    "( 4 ) the mass and total energy contributions of the blowout jet ( the contributions by the standard jet are negligible ) at @xmath56 are @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "these are only @xmath83 of the heliospheric mass and kinetic energy estimates by @xcite , but those authors considered three of the largest jets during a three - week _ hinode _ campaign @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath60 agrees with the order - of - magnitude estimate by @xcite obtained at @xmath84 .",
    "\\(5 ) using observed occurrence - rates of coronal jets , we estimated ranges for the total energy and proton - density fluxes produced by these events in the low corona and at 1au .",
    "we found very good agreement with the low - corona energy - flux estimate by .",
    "our estimate for the proton - density flux at 1au is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the values given by @xcite , @xcite , but it must be kept in mind that their estimate was obtained merely from _",
    "hinode_/xrt observations .",
    "( 6 ) comparing our results with in - situ measurements of sw fluxes , we estimate that coronal jets provide @xmath80% and @xmath0% to the total energy and mass content of the sw , respectively .",
    "our results are largely consistent with existing observational estimates of the contribution of coronal jets to the mass and energy content of the sw , and thus support the present conjecture that the these contribution are relatively small .",
    "however , it must be kept in mind that ( i ) obtaining such estimates requires simplifying assumptions , ( ii ) the measurement uncertainties are large , and ( iii ) our simulation is relatively idealized and only one parameter - set of the model ( assumed to be representative ) was considered so far .",
    "more advanced observations ( for instance from the upcoming solar orbiter and solar probe plus missions ) and simulations are needed to finally pin down the contribution of coronal jets to the sw .",
