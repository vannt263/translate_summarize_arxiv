    "zuckerman and becklin ( 1987 ) discovered that the white dwarf giclas 29 - 38 has a large infrared excess and proposed that the excess could be due to a brown dwarf companion .",
    "this suggestion inspired discussion of brown dwarfs as white dwarf companions ( stringfellow , black & bodenheimer 1990 ) , oscillating brown dwarfs ( marley , lunine & hubbard 1990 ) , and other possible cool companions that could explain the excess ( greenstein 1988 )",
    ". later photometry by tokunaga et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and telesco , joy & sisk ( 1990 ) suggested that the 10 micron excess greatly exceeds that expected from a brown dwarf companion , leading to the interpretation that the mid - infrared excess originates from a cloud of circumstellar dust .",
    "however , new data from isocam ( chary , zuckerman & becklin 1998 ) show that the 7 and 15 micron excesses are in agreement with a 1000 k blackbody fit to the excess at other wavelengths .",
    "the source of the infrared excess of g29 - 38 remains uncertain .",
    "direct searches for a companion have produced mixed results .",
    "tokunaga et al . ( 1988 ) imaged g29 - 38 at h and k bands and limited the extent of the source to a diameter of 400 milliarcseconds ( mas ) or 5.64 au .",
    "tokunaga et al . ( 1988 ) and tokunaga et al . ( 1990 ) took near - infrared spectra of the object and found no evidence for absorption features due to a brown dwarf .",
    "haas and leinert ( 1990 ) took slit scans of g29 - 38 in 1988 , and found a north - south extension at k - band that was well fit by a binary model with a flux ratio of 1:1 and a separation of @xmath2 mas ( @xmath3 au ) .",
    "however , when haas and lienert repeated their observations the following year under better seeing conditions , the object appeared unextended .",
    "shelton , becklin and zuckerman ( 1998 ) took slit scans of g29 - 38 in the j and k bands at the lick 3-meter telescope in october of 1989 to look for the centroid shift that would arise if , as the photometry suggests , the hypothetical cool companion is brighter in k and the white dwarf is brighter in j. they did not see this effect .",
    "they place an upper limit of @xmath4 mas ( 0.56 au ) on the north - south binary separation , and an upper limit of @xmath5 mas ( 1.69 au ) on the east - west separation .",
    "attempts to find the radial velocity signature of a companion to g29 - 38 have also proven frustrating .",
    "barnbaum & zuckerman ( 1992 ) combined their own spectroscopy with radial velocity data by graham et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , graham , reid , & rich ( 1991 , personal communication reported in graham et al . 1990 ) , liebert & saffer ( 1989 , personal communication reported in graham et al .",
    "1990 ) and liebert , saffer , & pilachowski ( 1989 ) , and reported a probable radial velocity variation with a period of 11.2 months and an amplitude of @xmath6 .",
    "kleinman et al . ( 1994 ) , however , argued based on extensive astroseismological observations that the radial velocity variation due to a binary companion must be less than @xmath7 assuming a @xmath81 year period .    hoping to find another clue to the mystery of the infrared excess , we imaged g29 - 38 at k band on the 10-m w. m. keck telescope using speckle interferometry to search for a resolved companion at the diffraction limit .",
    "we imaged g29 - 38 at k band with nirc ( the near - infrared camera ; matthews & soifer 1994 ) on the w. m. keck telescope on december 15 , 1997 .",
    "the seeing was extraordinary ; we used 0.5 second integrations and saw about 5 speckles and a diffraction - limited core .",
    "we took 12 sets of 100 frames of g29 - 38 . among observations of g29 - 38 we interspersed observations of two nearby , presumably unresolved calibrator stars , s23291 + 0515 and s23292 + 0521 , which we observed in the same manner as g29 - 38 , for a total of 6 sets of calibrator frames .",
    "we used a version of the speckle reduction software described in koresko et al .",
    "( 1991 ) adapted for use with nirc .",
    "we chose a @xmath9 pixel subframe centered on the object , and constructed @xmath9 pixel sky frames from the corners of the @xmath10 pixel nirc images . from each set of object and sky frames we computed a power spectrum , and a bi - spectrum , and re - constructed fourier phases and amplitudes .",
    "we divided the fourier components from each target set by the fourier components from a few different calibrator sets to correct for the telescope - aperture transfer function , and in this way assembled 18 calibrated images and 18 calibrated power spectra .",
    "figure 1 shows the mean of the images , compared to a simulated image of a point source  the fourier transform of the gaussian@xmath11hanning apodizing function used to synthesize the speckle images .",
    "the plate scale is 20.57 mas per pixel .",
    "figure 2 shows the azimuthal average of the arithmetic mean of the calibrated power spectra , where we normalized each power spectrum by dividing it by the geometric mean of the first 15 data points after the zero - frequency component .",
    "the error bars represent the 1-@xmath12 variations among the 18 power spectra .",
    "the @xmath13 diffraction limit of keck at k - band is 55 mas .",
    "the noise increases at high frequencies because the power in the images decreases near the diffraction limit .",
    "the low frequency spike probably occurs because of seeing noise , the change in seeing between observations of g29 - 38 and observations of the calibrators .",
    "because the final image closely resembles a point source and the power spectrum is consistent with a constant , the power spectrum of a @xmath14-function , we conclude that we did not resolve g29 - 38 .",
    "the k - band flux of g29 - 38 is @xmath15 mjy ; 2.05 mjy of this is in excess of greenstein s ( 1988 ) white dwarf model ( tokunaga , becklin & zuckerman 1990 ) .",
    "we computed the power spectrum of a binary system consisting of a greenstein white dwarf and a point - like companion which supplies all the excess flux .",
    "the only free parameter for this binary model is the angular separation of the components .",
    "we fit the model to the observed power spectrum , and derive a best fit binary separation of 20 mas .",
    "the maximum deviation of the power spectrum from a straight line , however , is consistent with typical deviations due to time variations of the atmosphere - telescope point - spread function . in figure 2",
    ", we compare the 20 mas model with the observed power spectrum and a model with the same flux ratio but a 30 mas separation .",
    "the latter model is marginally inconsistent with our observations , so we report 30 mas as an upper limit to the binary separation .    at g29 - 38 s distance of 14.1 pc ( tokunaga et al .",
    "1990 ) , 30 mas corresponds to a transverse separation of 0.42 au .",
    "assuming that g29 - 38 is 0.61 @xmath16 ( bergeron et al .",
    "1995 ) , an 0.06 @xmath16 brown dwarf orbiting the star at 0.42 au would have a period of about 0.33 years and would create a reflex motion in g29 - 38 that would have been detectable to kleinman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) if the orbit were inclined more than 10 degrees from face - on .",
    "the statistical likelyhood of an inclination @xmath17 degrees is 1.5% .",
    "closer orbits would be easier to detect from reflex motion .    perhaps a brown dwarf orbits g29 - 38 with a long period that would be hard to identify in reflex motion and the brown dwarf happened to pass in front of the star or behind it when we observed it on december 15 , 1997 .",
    "for instance , kleinman et al . (",
    "1994 ) saw a long - term trend in their radial velocity data which could be interpreted as a companion with an @xmath18 year period causing radial velocity variations on the order of 0.8 km / s .",
    "such a companion would have a semimajor axis of @xmath19 au . if the orbit had a semi - major axis @xmath20 , and were edge - on ,",
    "the fraction of the time the brown dwarf would spend in the region where we could nt resolve it is @xmath21 ; for @xmath22 au , there is a @xmath23% chance that the brown dwarf would have been hidden from us . since shelton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) also missed the hypothetical edge - on brown dwarf in 1989 as it passed close to the star , we find this scenario unlikely .",
    "a companion in an eccentric orbit is easier to detect from reflex motion than a companion in a circular orbit with the same semi - major axis .",
    "therefore such a companion would have to be farther away from the star on average for kleinman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to have missed it , making it even more unlikely that it would have been hidden from us , haas & lienert ( 1990 ) , and shelton et al .",
    "a companion in an eccentric , face - on orbit would spend relatively little time close to the star , and probably would not have been missed by both us and shelton et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the infrared excess may represent thermal radiation from a cloud of dust rather than a cool companion ( zuckerman & becklin 1987 ) .",
    "we can place no constraints on the concentration or geometry of such a cloud .",
    "dust radiating thermally at 115 microns heated by radiation from the white dwarf alone would be far too close to the star ( @xmath24 au ) for us to resolve .",
    "we conclude that the infrared excess of g29 - 38 is not due to a single orbiting companion .",
    "if there were a single companion producing the excess , it would have to orbit almost face - on and closer than 0.4 au ; or it could orbit roughly edge on , with a period of several years , in such a way that it happened to appear at a minimum angular separation from the star in december , 1997 when we observed it and in the fall of 1989 when haas & lienert ( 1990 ) and shelton et al . (",
    "1998 ) observed it .",
    "either case is highly improbable .",
    "this result supports the hypothesis that source of the near - infrared excess is not a cool companion but a dust cloud ( zuckerman & becklin 1987 ; wickramasinghe et al .",
    "1987 ; graham et al . 1990 ; koester et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we thank eugene chiang , chris clemens , peter goldreich , and ben zuckerman for inspiration and helpful discussions .",
    "the observations reported here were obtained at the w. m. keck observatory , which is operated by the california association for research in astronomy , a scientific partnership among california institute of technology , the university of california , and the national aeronautics and space administration .",
