    "absorption features in the ly@xmath0  forest provide direct information on the large scale distribution of neutral hydrogen in the highly ionized intergalactic medium ( bahcall & salpeter 1965 ; gunn & peterson 1965 ; see e.g. rauch 1998 for a review ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0  forest is believed to originate in a warm photoionized , fluctuating intergalactic medium ( igm ) which smoothly traces the distribution of the dark matter .",
    "this picture is sustained by hydrodynamical simulations and semi - analytical models which have succeeded in reproducing the observed statistics of the absorption lines and transmitted flux ( e.g. mcgill 1990 ; bi 1993 ; cen 1994 ; zhang , anninos & norman 1995 ; petitjean , mcket & kates 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ; katz 1996 ; miralda - escud 1996 ; hui , gnedin & zhang 1997 ; theuns 1998 ; schaye 2001 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath0  forest can therefore serve as a probe the physical state of the igm , and the underlying matter distribution over a wide range of scales and redshifts ( e.g. croft 1998 ; nusser & haehnelt 2000 ; schaye 2000 ) .",
    "several method have been proposed for recovering the shape and amplitude of the primordial power spectrum , @xmath11 ( e.g. croft 1998 , 2002b ; mcdonald 2000 ; mcdonald 2003 ) .",
    "the current methods rely either on an inversion of the one - dimensional flux power spectrum @xmath12 ( e.g. croft 1999 , 2002b ; mcdonald 2003 ) , or on a forward comparison between the data and the simulations ( e.g. zaldarriaga , hui & tegmark 2001 ; mcdonald 2004b ) .",
    "the nonlinear relation between the matter and flux power spectra is calibrated by means of detailed numerical simulations ( e.g. croft 1998 ; mcdonald 2003 ) .",
    "these methods are fundamentally limited by continuum fitting errors , metal contamination and nonlinear corrections ( e.g. hui 2001 ; zaldarriaga , scoccimarro & hui 2003 ; see also gnedin & hamilton 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , one has to marginalize over the nuisance parameters in order to place constraints on the spectral index @xmath13 and the power spectrum normalisation amplitude @xmath9 .",
    "underestimating the mean flux level @xmath14 , for example , can strongly bias the results as it was shown by seljak , mcdonald & makarov ( 2003 ) , and viel , haehnelt & springel ( 2004 ) .",
    "the most recent analyses of the ly@xmath0  forest favour a simple scale - invariant model with @xmath9 in the range 0.85 - 0.95 ( mcdonald 2004b ; viel , haehnelt & springel 2004 ; viel , weller & haehnelt 2004 ; seljak 2004 ) . however , one should emphasize that these studies do not include in their analysis other statistics than the power spectrum of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "a priori , a model which fits the observed power spectrum solely will not necessarily agree with the observed pdf , bispectrum etc .",
    "it is therefore prudent to examine how other statistical measures of the forest constrain the cosmological model .    in this work ,",
    "we follow a different strategy and assess the validity of a cosmological model using three statistical measures of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "these statistics are the one - dimensional flux power spectrum , @xmath12 , the flux probability distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath15 , and the neutral hydrogen column density distribution @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , we adopt the `` forward approach '' which consists in comparing the observed statistical measures with those directly derived from n - body simulations of the cosmological model under consideration ( see e.g. zaldarriaga , hui & tegmark 2001 ) .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it does not require any inversion procedure to obtain the linear mass power spectrum .",
    "combining several statistical measures could significantly affect the constraints on the shape and amplitude of the primordial power spectrum as inferred from @xmath12 alone . in this study",
    ", we will attempt to match simultaneously the three statistics mentioned above . in principle , higher order correlations such as the bispectrum should also be considered since they provide independent information on the cosmology ( e.g. mandelbaum 2003 ) . however , the ly@xmath0  bispectrum as computed from high - resolution qso spectra is still too noisy to provide significant constraints on the cosmological model ( e.g. viel 2004a ) . to explore a parameter space as large as possible , we will implement a simple semi - analytical model which reproduces many properties of the ly@xmath0  absorbers ( e.g. bi , brner & chu 1992 ; reisenegger & miralda - escud 1995 ; bi & davidsen 1997 ; gnedin & hui 1998 ) . we will generate a wide sample of mock catalogs and constrain the model parameters by comparing their statistical properties to the observations of mcdonald ( 2000 ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ data ]",
    "we briefly review the observational data we aim at fitting in this analysis . in ",
    "[ igm ] , we detail the method used to compute synthetic spectra from pure dark matter ( dm ) simulations . the comparison between simulation and observations is done in ",
    "[ compare ] .",
    "we discuss our results in  [ discussion ] .",
    "in this paper , we will compare the simulated statistics to the flux power spectrum and pdf measured by mcdonald ( 2000 ) ( hereafter m00 ) , which were obtained from a sample of eight high - resolution qso spectra .",
    "regarding the flux power spectrum , we consider the data points in the range @xmath17 .",
    "the lower limit @xmath18 is set by the size of our simulations ( cf .",
    "section   [ nbody ] ) . note that it is larger than the characteristic wavenumber @xmath19 below which continuum fitting errors are expected to become important ( e.g. hui 2001 ) .",
    "the upper limit @xmath20 is chosen because of concern about metal contamination on smaller scales ( e.g. m00 ; kim 2004 ) .",
    "the observed flux pdf is very sensitive to continuum fitting , especially in the high transmissivity tail .",
    "we therefore exclude the data points with @xmath21 from the analysis to avoid dealing with continuum fitting error .",
    "in addition , we discard also the measurement at @xmath22 since it is strongly affected by noise ( e.g. rauch 1997 ) . finally , we emphasize that we work with the power spectrum of the transmitted flux @xmath23 , @xmath12 , which differs from that of the flux density contrast , @xmath24 , by a multiplicative factor @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath12 has the advantage that it does not depend explicitly on the mean flux level @xmath14 .",
    ".the main parameters of the @xmath1cdm simulations considered in the present paper .",
    "the normalisation of the rsi simulations follows from the results of spergel ( 2003 ) . the spectral index @xmath13 and its derivative @xmath26 are given at @xmath27 .",
    "the mass of a dark matter particle is about @xmath28 in all the simulations . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table3 ]    we have used n - body simulations of variants of the @xmath1cdm models to generate synthetic spectra of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "we have simulated the standard @xmath1cdm cosmology with scale - invariant spectral index models , as well as a running spectral index model ( spergel 2003 ) . the one - dimensional flux power spectrum ( ps ) and flux probability distribution function ( pdf )",
    "have been computed from mock catalogs , and compared to the observational data in order to constrain the cosmological models and the physical parameters that dictate the properties of the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "in addition to the one- and two - point correlations , we have also computed the neutral hydrogen column density distribution and the line width distribution .",
    "these last two statistics have only been used as a consistency check for the models which give the best fit to the observed ps and pdf .",
    "the rsi model matches the ps somewhat better than our scale - invariant model with rms fluctuation @xmath5 , but overestimates the pdf in the range @xmath29 unless the temperature is very high , @xmath30 . a scale - invariant model with @xmath5 matches better the flux pdf but tends to overestimate @xmath12 on scale @xmath31 when the temperature is large , @xmath32 .",
    "however , the agreement with the observed flux power spectrum can be improved by lowering the value of the normalisation amplitude , @xmath33 .",
    "most importantly , models which match best the ps data alone usually do not yield a good fit to the pdf .",
    "the discrepancy worsens with decreasing temperature . in the case of the @xmath5 , scale - invariant cosmology ,",
    "the disagreement with the observed pdf is particularly severe for @xmath30 .",
    "we also computed the line statistics for some of our best fit models .",
    "we found that they all reproduce successfully the slope and normalisation of the column density distribution @xmath16 , as well as the overall line - width distribution @xmath34 .",
    "the simulated line - width distribution is probably affected by resolution effects . yet",
    "the constraints on the primordial power spectrum are insensitive to the details of the line - width statistic .",
    "degeneracies among the parameters diminish the ability of the data to constrain the shape and normalisation of the primordial power spectrum ( e.g. zaldarriaga , hui & tegmark 2001 ; zaldarriaga , scoccimarro & hui 2003 ) . in this respect , we have found that the pairs @xmath35 - @xmath36 and @xmath37 - @xmath9 are degenerate when we marginalize over the mean transmitted flux . to proceed further",
    ", we have assumed that the filtering wavenumber @xmath36 is related to the igm temperature according to @xmath38 .",
    "the reasons which motivate this choice are discussed in appendix   [ filtering ] . under that assumption",
    ", a chi - squared minimization indicates that the normalisation amplitude is likely to be @xmath39 for a reasonable reionization scenario and temperatures @xmath40 .",
    "for @xmath41 , the data favour models with normalisation @xmath42 rather than models with @xmath43 , the later slightly overestimating @xmath12 in the range @xmath7 .",
    "it should also be noted that taking into account the full error matrix of the flux pdf systematically lowers the best fit values of @xmath9 by a few percents .",
    "our results suggest that the constraints inferred from measurements of the flux power spectrum alone might be biased .",
    "most previous estimates of @xmath33 from ly@xmath0  absorption measurement relied on the flux ps alone ( e.g. croft 1999 , 2002 ; mcdonald 2000 , 2004b ; viel , haehnelt & springel 2004 ; see also viel , weller & haehnelt 2004 ; seljak 2004 . in light of our results",
    "however , it is unclear whether their best fit models also match the pdf of the flux ( and other statistics of the ly@xmath0  forest as well ) . to emphasize the importance of combining several statistics we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] the constraints on @xmath33 obtained from the ps data alone ( curves with square ) to those from from the whole ps+pdf data set ( curves with triangles ) .",
    "we assumed a filtering wavenumber of @xmath44 .",
    "the curves @xmath45 were calculated for a mean igm temperature @xmath46 ( solid curves ) , 1.5 ( long - dashed ) and 2 ( short - dashed ) , but for a fixed adiabatic index @xmath47 .",
    "note that the best fit values of @xmath9 in the case of the ps data only are consistent with those inferred in previous works .",
    "[ fig12 ] clearly demonstrates that the inclusion of the pdf in the minimization has a large impact on the normalisation amplitude , decreasing the best fit value of @xmath9 by about 20% .",
    "consequently , the analysis of viel , haehnelt & springel ( 2004 ) and mcdonald ( 2004b ) may overestimate the normalisation amplitude .",
    "furthermore , including the pdf significantly improves the confidence on @xmath9 as we can see from the shape of @xmath45 .",
    "finally , as we discussed in section   [ errors ] , it also noticeably reduces the sensitivity of the results to the mean flux level @xmath14 .",
    "a joint fit of the flux power spectrum and pdf can thus greatly improve over the standard analysis based on the flux power spectrum alone .",
    "although including the flux pdf tends to lower the best fit value of @xmath33 , overall our result of @xmath48 is consistent with the studies of viel , haehnelt & springel ( 2004 ) , and mcdonald ( 2004b ) .",
    "both of these studies were based on flux measurements at several redshifts ( mcdonald 2004b use eleven redshift bins spanning the range @xmath49 ) .",
    "they also relied on a more detailed treatment of the gas physics by means of hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "our assumption of uniform smoothing does not account for the dependence of the smoothing on the local igm density and temperature . yet the exact relation between the gas and dark matter depends on the rather poorly constrained thermal and reionization history of the universe .",
    "simulations incorporating a wider variety of reionization histories are needed for a better understanding of the systematics in inferring the cosmological parameters from the forest .",
    "it is also unclear whether the currently available hydrodynamical simulations give reasonable flux pdfs .",
    "we have demonstrated that a joint analysis of the forest can potentially yield more robust estimates of the cosmological parameters than those inferred from the flux power spectrum alone .",
    "here we have included mainly the pdf and the flux power spectrum .",
    "but other statistical measures can also be used .",
    "the flux bispectrum ( e.g. mandelbaum 2003 ) offers a promising possibility as it should be less sensitive to systematics than the pdf .",

    "the fourier transform of the gas density field is simply given by @xmath88 e^{-\\frac{1}{2}k^2\\xf^2}e^{-i\\vk\\cdot\\vx}\\ ; , \\label{app6}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the dirac delta function .",
    "the gas power spectrum is then ( ignoring the term at @xmath90 ) @xmath91 where the fields @xmath92 , @xmath76 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 are evaluated at position @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively .",
    "@xmath97 is thus the fourier transform of a mass - weighted filter , @xmath98=\\la\\left(1+\\dmnl\\right)\\left(1+\\dmnl'\\right ) e^{-\\frac{1}{2}k^2(\\xf^2+\\xf'^2)}\\ra\\;. \\label{app8}\\ ] ] to estimate @xmath36 , we consider the limit of small wavenumbers @xmath99 .",
    "since the integrand is weighted by @xmath100 , we expect the main contribution to the integral to arise in the limit @xmath101 .",
    "expanding the previous equation to first order in @xmath83 and taking the limit @xmath101 , we have @xmath102&\\approx&\\left(1+\\xi_{\\rm m}(r)\\right)-\\frac{k^2}{2 } \\la\\left(1+\\dmnl\\right)\\left(1+\\dmnl'\\right)(\\xf^2+\\xf'^2)\\ra\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\left(1+\\xi_{\\rm m}(r)\\right)\\left[1-k^2 \\frac{\\la \\left(1+\\dmnl\\right)\\left(1+\\dmnl'\\right)\\xf^2\\ra } { 1+\\xi_{\\rm m}(r)}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx&\\left(1+\\xi_{\\rm m}(r)\\right ) \\left[1-k^2\\la\\left(1+\\dmnl\\right)\\xf^2\\ra\\right]\\ ; , \\label{app8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the cross - terms @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and the two - point correlation @xmath105 tend to zero for large separation .",
    "hence , in the limit @xmath106 , the gas power spectrum can be expressed as @xmath107 where @xmath36 is an effective filtering length which differs from the filtering length @xmath108 at mean density , @xmath109 here , @xmath110 is the one - point probability distribution of the dark matter density field .",
    "( [ app10 ] ) shows that , in the linear regime , @xmath36 is obtained from a mass - weighted average of the local filtering length @xmath76 . to evaluate @xmath36",
    ", we will assume that the dark matter pdf is well approximated by a lognormal distribution , @xmath111 with @xmath112 , and where @xmath113 is the linear rms of dark matter fluctuations ( coles & jones 1991 ) .",
    "although this approximation is inaccurate when @xmath114 , it should be adequate enough to assess whether @xmath36 is larger or smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "the calculation yields @xmath115 where we have used @xmath116 .",
    "note that , since @xmath76 depends on the local gas density through relation  ( [ app3 ] ) , we should expect @xmath117 to be a smoothed version of the dark matter rms fluctuation amplitude , i.e. a function of @xmath36 .",
    "nonetheless , equation  ( [ app12 ] ) clearly shows that , for an adiabatic index @xmath81 , the mass - weighted filtering wavenumber @xmath36 is smaller than that at mean density .",
    "this follows from the fact that most of the mass resides in moderately high - density regions where the temperature @xmath118 is significantly larger than @xmath37 ( e.g. bi & davidsen 1997 ) .",
    "consequently , given that i ) @xmath119 and ii ) @xmath120 , we can place an upper limit on the filtering @xmath36 .",
    "for the particular choice @xmath47 , one has @xmath121 .",
    "bearing in mind that the igm temperature is most probably larger than @xmath122 at @xmath4 ( e.g. schaye 2000 ) , we believe that @xmath123 should be a reliable lower limit on the amount of filtering at @xmath4 for a reasonable history of the universe ."
