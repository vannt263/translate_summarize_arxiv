    "generally , the problem of structure formation is associated to the gravitational growth of small density fluctuations generated by physical processes in the very early universe .",
    "also , these fluctuations are supposed to build a gaussian random field ( grf ) , where the fourier components @xmath0 have independent , random and uniformly distributed phases .",
    "such a condition means that phases are non - correlated in space and assures the statistical properties of the grf are completely specified by the two - point correlation function or , equivalently , by the power spectrum @xmath1 , which contains information on the density fluctuation amplitude of each scale @xmath2 .",
    "this makes the choice of a grf the simplest initial condition for structure formation studies from the mathematical point of view . at the same time , the grf simplicity is vindicated by a great number of inflationary models that predict a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of gaussian density perturbations from quantum - mechanical fluctuations in the field that drives inflation ( guth & pi 1982 ) .",
    "likewise , the central limit theorem guarantees a grf if a wide range of random physical processes acts on the distribution of matter in the early universe",
    ".    however , a number of mechanisms can generate non - gaussian density fluctuations .",
    "for instance , they arise in some inflation models with multiple scalar fields ( e.g. salopek , bond & bardeen 1989 ) ; or after phase transitions when different types of topological defects can be formed ( kibble 1976 ) ; still , by any discrete , random distributed seed masses like primordial black holes and soliton objects ( sherrer & bertschinger 1991 ) ; as well as in astrophysical processes during the non - linear regime where early generations of massive stars produce shocks which sweep material on to giant blast waves triggering formation of large - scale structure ( ostriker & cowie 1981 ) . thus , in order to better understand the process of structure formation , it is necessary to investigate the possibility of the non - gaussian statistics contribution to the density fluctuation field .    due to the difficulty to work with generic statistical models , the usual approach is to examine specific classes of non - gaussian distributions",
    ". examples of these efforts are the studies carried out by weinberg & cole ( 1992 ) that studied non - gaussian initial conditions generated by a range of specific local transformations of an underlying gaussian field ; moscardini et al .",
    "( 1991 ) investigated whether non - gaussian initial conditions can help to reconcile the cdm models with observations ; and kayama , soda & taruya ( 1999 ) , who used data on the abundance of clusters at three different redshifts to establish constraints on structure formation models based on chi - squared non - gaussian fluctuations generated during inflation .    in this work",
    ", we propose a new approach to this problem , exploring the hypothesis that initial conditions for structure formation do not build a single grf , but a combination of different fields , produced by different physical mechanisms , whose resultant effect presents an arbitrarily small departure from the strict gaussianity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we introduce the statistical analysis of finite mixture distributions and present a two - component mixture model ; in sections 3 , we apply the model to the cluster abundance evolution ; in section 4 we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "suppose the density fluctuations field , given by the density contrast @xmath3 , is a random variable which takes values in a sample space @xmath4 , and that its distribution can be represented by a probability density function of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7    when this happens , we say that @xmath8 has a finite mixture distribution defined by ( 2.1 ) , where the components of the mixture are @xmath9 and the mixing weights are @xmath10 ( e.g. titterrington , smith & makov 1985 ) .",
    "note that we are not using here the central limit theorem .",
    "mathematically , this will be valid only when @xmath11 and the weights have similar values , so that one process has no more importance than the others .",
    "we are not making these hypotheses here and , consequently , the summation of processes will not necessarily converge to a gaussian .",
    "statistical evidence for a small level of non - gaussianity in the anisotropy of the cosmic background radiation temperature has been found in the cobe 4 year maps ( e.g. ferreira , magueijo & gsrki 1998 ; pando , valls - gabaud & fang 1998 ; magueijo 1999 ) .",
    "non - gaussian statistics is also expected in the framework of biased models of galaxy formation ( bardeen et al .",
    "1986 ) . in this case",
    ", analytical arguments show that non - gaussian behaviour corresponds to a threshold effect superimposed on the gaussian background ( politzer & wise 1984 ; jensen & szalay 1986 ) . in the same way",
    ", hybrid models show that it is possible for structure to be seeded by a weighted combination of adiabatic perturbations produced during inflation and active isocurvature pertubations produced by topological defects generated at the end of the inflationary epoch ( e.g. battye & weller 1998 ) .",
    "thus , a very compelling way to simplify our model is to apply ( 2.1 ) to the combination of only two fields : a grf plus a second field , where the latter will represent a small departure from the strict gaussianity .",
    "this can be posed as @xmath12    the first field will be always the gaussian component and a possible effect of the second component is to modify the grf to have positive and/or negative tails .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 in ( 2.2 ) allow us to modulate the relative importance between the two components .",
    "it represents an arbitrarily small departure from the strict gaussianity and can be due to some primordial mechanism acting on the energy distribution .",
    "such a two - component random field can be generated by taking @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a random number with distribution given by ( 2.2 ) .",
    "then we have @xmath16\\nu^2d\\nu\\right]d^3k\\eqno(2.3)\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the volume of an arbitrarily large region of the universe . the quantity in the brackets",
    "will be defined as the mixture term @xmath18\\nu^2d\\nu\\eqno(2.4)\\ ] ]    so that @xmath19 , for the case where @xmath13 is not scale - dependent . in the same way",
    ", the @xmath20 mass overdensity within a certain scale @xmath21 will be @xmath22 .    as an ilustration , in this work we explore the case of a positive skewness model , where the second field adds to the gaussian component a positive tail representing a number of rare peaks in the density fluctuation field .",
    "a simple way to obtain this effect is to take the well known lognormal distribution as the second component . besides its mathematical simplicity",
    ", this distribution seems to play an important role over the non - linear regime for a wide range of physical scales ( e.g. coles & jones 1991 , plionis & vardarini 1995 , bi & davidsen 1997 ) . accordingly",
    ", our mixture becomes @xmath23    ( for the case of mean zero ) . introducing ( 2.5 ) in ( 2.4 ) , we find @xmath24\\nu^2d\\nu\\eqno(2.6)\\ ] ]    resolving this integral we have @xmath25\\eqno(2.7)\\ ] ]    hence , if @xmath26 , then @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which means that a sufficiently small contribution of the second field leaves the amplitude and shape of the power spectrum and the mass fluctuation practically unchanged .",
    "the correct framework to describe the evolution of non - linear objects in the context of this model requires a generalization of the press & schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) in order to take into account the second field . assuming that only regions with @xmath29 will form gravitationally bound objects with mass larger than @xmath30 by the time @xmath31 , the fraction of these objects can be calculated through @xmath32    where @xmath33 .",
    "this quantity is transformed into the comoving number density of objects with mass between @xmath30 and @xmath34 by taking @xmath35 and dividing it by @xmath36 .",
    "thus , @xmath37 dm \\eqno(3.2)\\ ] ]    where @xmath38 is the background density and the number 2 comes from the correction factor @xmath39^{-1}=2 $ ] , which takes into account all the mass of the universe . if @xmath40 is given by ( 2.2 ) , then ( 3.2 ) can be written as @xmath41 d\\nu\\right ] dm \\eqno(3.3)\\ ] ] now , introducing ( 2.5 ) in ( 3.3 ) we have @xmath42 dm \\eqno(3.4)\\ ] ]    following sasaki ( 1994 ) , we rewrite ( 3.4 ) to give the density of objects with mass in the range @xmath43 about @xmath30 which virialize at the redshift @xmath44 and survive until the present epoch without merging with other systems .",
    "it becomes @xmath45\\eqno(3.5)\\ ] ]    where @xmath46,~~ a(m , z)=\\left({m\\over m_\\ast(z)}\\right)^{{(n+3)}\\over 6}exp\\left[-{1\\over 2}\\left({m\\over m_\\ast(z)}\\right)^{{(n+3)}\\over 3}\\right],\\ ] ]    @xmath47 ^ 2~{\\rm{and}}~~ m_\\ast(z)=m_\\ast(1+z)^{-6/(n+3)}\\ ] ]    eq.(3.5 ) allows us to compare the cluster abundance evolution with observational data .",
    "clusters , as the most massive collapsed structures , correspond to rare peaks in the primordial density field and so their abundance is sensitive to the occurence of non - gaussianity in the density fluctuation distribution . also , cluster evolution provides a constraint on the amplitude of the mass fluctuation at 8 @xmath48 mpc scale , @xmath49 , and on the cosmological density parameter , @xmath50 , through the relation @xmath51 ( e.g. henry & arnaud 1991 ; pen 1998 ) . in a recent work , bahcall ( 1999 )",
    "shows that several independent methods based on clusters data indicate a low mass densitiy in the universe , @xmath52 and , in consequence , @xmath53 , breaking the degeneracy between these parameters .    here",
    ", we compare the behaviour of the cluster abundance evolution given by ( 3.5 ) with data compiled by bahcall & fan ( 1998 ) . as an example , we plot in figure 1a some fits to the observational data for two different values of @xmath50 ( 0.2 and 1.0 ) .",
    "note that our model is very sensitive to the parameter @xmath13 . even for @xmath54 ( i.e. , almost gaussian initial conditions ) , the curves diverge significantly from the strict gaussian cases .",
    "this means that even very small deviations from gaussianity may introduce a significant change in the cluster abundance .",
    "actually , the presence of the second field tends to slow down the cluster abundance evolution at high redshifts . in the case of @xmath55",
    "this effect is dramatic for @xmath56 , while in the case of @xmath57 the difference is less pronounced and it is clearer for @xmath58 . indeed , by plotting the 68% confidence limits around the curve @xmath57",
    ", we see that gaussian and non - gaussian models are not clearly distinguishable for @xmath59 ( see figure 1b ) .",
    "this is associated to the small number of observational points and , possibly , to the simplicity of our model . however , even considering these caveats , our results seem to indicate that small deviations from the strict gaussianity may play an important role in the cluster abundance evolution .",
    "we presented the first results of a study concerning small deviations from gaussianity in the primordial density field .",
    "using very simple arguments , we developed a model based on the combination of two random fields in order to take into account the non - gaussianity effects .",
    "this model is physically motivated in the context of hybrid models , as well as in the framework of biased scenarios for structure formation .",
    "the weighted combined field involves a parameter @xmath13 which modulates the relative importance of its components . for @xmath26 , we preserve the amplitude and shape of @xmath60 and @xmath61 almost the same as in the gaussian case . at the same time ,",
    "our results suggest that even very small values of @xmath62 can introduce a significant change in the cluster abundance evolution .",
    "this effect seems to be stronger in high density universes ( at @xmath59 ) than in low density universes where the effect probably turns more important at higher redshifts .",
    "the model has some drawbacks .",
    "firstly , it depends on the choice and amplitude of the second component of the combined field .",
    "our choice of the lognormal function had a mathematical criterion of simplicity .",
    "a detailed investigation of the use of different distribution functions as the second component will be the subject of future works . however , the reasonable agreement between the model and the data gives some support to our arbitrary choice .",
    "other possible limitation of this work comes from the use of the analytical approximation to the density of non - linear objects following sasaki ( 1994 ) .",
    "a more accurate description of the cluster abundance evolution requires the utilization of numerical methods . but blain & longair ( 1993 ) , also working in the press & schecter framework , found results numerically similar to sasaki s , so it seems that using this analytical approximation does not introduce any systematical error .",
    "finally , we should keep in mind that our results are preliminary and both theoretical and observational efforts are necessary in order to confirm or disproof the hypothesis that the primordial density field can be described as a slightly non - gaussian distribution .",
