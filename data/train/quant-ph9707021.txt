    "define a _ protected subspace _ @xmath20 as follows @xmath21 this construction gives us a definition of a quantum code @xmath22 , called a _ toric code",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the _ stabilizer operators _ of this code .    to find the dimensionality of the subspace @xmath23",
    ", we can observe that there are two relations between the stabilizer operators , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "so , there are @xmath26 independent stabilizer operators .",
    "it follows from the general theory of additive quantum codes  @xcite that @xmath27 .    however , there is a more instructive way of computing @xmath28 .",
    "let us find the algebra @xmath29 of all linear operators on the space @xmath23  this will give us full information about this space .",
    "let @xmath30 be the algebra of operators generated by @xmath15 , @xmath16 . clearly , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the algebra of all operators which commute with @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath33 is the ideal generated by @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the algebra @xmath36 is generated by operators of the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a loop ( closed path ) on the lattice , whereas @xmath39 is a cut , i.e. a loop on the dual lattice ( see fig .  [ fig_loops ] ) .",
    "if a loop ( or a cut ) is contractible then the operator @xmath40 is a product of @xmath16 , hence @xmath41 .",
    "thus , only non - contractible loops or cuts are interesting .",
    "it follows that the algebra @xmath29 is generated by 4 operators @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 corresponding to the loops @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the cuts @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_loops ] ) .",
    "the operators @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 have the same commutation relations as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "we see that each quantum state @xmath54 corresponds to a state of 2 qubits .",
    "hence , the protected subspace @xmath23 is 4-dimensional .    # 0.6##20.6#0.6    in a more abstract language , the algebra @xmath55 corresponds to @xmath56-boundaries and @xmath57-coboundaries ( with coefficients from @xmath58 ) , @xmath36 corresponds to @xmath17-cycles and @xmath17-cocycles , and @xmath29 corresponds to @xmath17-homologies and @xmath17-cohomologies .",
    "there is also an explicit description of the protected subspace which may be not so useful but is easier to grasp .",
    "let us choose basis vectors in the hilbert space @xmath19 by assigning a label @xmath59 to each edge @xmath60",
    ".   means `` spin up '' , @xmath17 means `` spin down '' .",
    "the pauli operators @xmath61 , @xmath62 have the standard form in this basis . ]",
    "the constraints @xmath63 say that the sum of the labels at the boundary of a face should be zero @xmath64 .",
    "more exactly , only such basis vectors contribute to a vector from the protected subspace .",
    "such a basis vector is characterized by two topological numbers : the sums of @xmath65 along the loops @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the constraints @xmath66 say that all basis vectors with the same topological numbers enter @xmath67 with equal coefficients .",
    "thus , for each of the @xmath68 possible combinations of the topological numbers @xmath69 , there is one vector from the protected subspace , @xmath70 of course , one can also create linear combinations of these vectors .",
    "now we are to show that the code @xmath22 detects @xmath71 errors . ]",
    "( hence , it corrects @xmath72 errors ) . consider a multiple error @xmath73 this error can not be detected by syndrome measurement ( i.e. by measuring the eigenvalues of all @xmath15 , @xmath74 ) if and only if @xmath75 . however , if @xmath76 then @xmath77 for every @xmath54 .",
    "such an error is not an error at all  it does not affect the protected subspace .",
    "the bad case is when @xmath75 but @xmath78 .",
    "hence , the support of @xmath79 should contain a non - contractible loop or cut .",
    "it is only possible if @xmath80 .",
    "( here @xmath81 is the set of @xmath60 for which @xmath82 or @xmath83 ) .",
    "one may say that the toric codes have quite poor parameters . well , they are not `` good '' codes in the sense of  @xcite",
    ". however , the code @xmath22 corrects _ almost any _ multiple error of size @xmath84 .",
    "( the constant factor in @xmath85 is related to the percolation problem ) .",
    "so , these codes work if the error rate is constant but smaller than some threshold value .",
    "the nicest property of the codes @xmath22 is that they are _ local check codes_. namely ,    1 .",
    "each stabilizer operators involves bounded number of qubits ( at most @xmath68 ) .",
    "each qubit is involved in a bounded number of stabilizer operators ( at most @xmath68 ) .",
    "3 .   there is no limit for the number of errors that can be corrected .",
    "also , at a constant error rate , the unrecoverable error probability goes to zero as @xmath86 .",
    "it has been already mentioned that error detection involves syndrome measurement . to correct the error",
    ", one needs to find its characteristic vector @xmath87 out of the syndrome .",
    "this is the usual error correction scheme .",
    "a new suggestion is to perform error correction at the physical level .",
    "consider the hamiltonian @xmath88 diagonalizing this hamiltonian is an easy job because the operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 commute .",
    "in particular , the ground state coincides with the protected subspace of the code @xmath22 ; it is 4-fold degenerate .",
    "all excited states are separated by an energy gap @xmath89 , because the difference between the eigenvalues of @xmath15 or @xmath16 equals @xmath56 .",
    "this hamiltonian is more or less realistic because in involves only _ local _ interactions .",
    "we can expect that `` errors '' , i.e.  noise - induced excitations will be removed automatically by some relaxation processes .",
    "of course , this requires cooling , i.e.  some coupling to a thermal bath with low temperature ( in addition to the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) ) .",
    "now let us see whether this model is stable to perturbation .",
    "( if not , there is no practical use of it ) . for example , consider a perturbation of the form @xmath90 it is important that the perturbation is local , i.e.  each term of it contains a small number of @xmath91 ( at most 2 ) .",
    "let us estimate the energy splitting between two orthogonal ground states of the original hamiltonian , @xmath54 and @xmath92 .",
    "we can use the usual perturbation theory because the energy spectrum has a gap . in the @xmath93-th order of the perturbation theory , the splitting is proportional to @xmath94 or @xmath95 .",
    "however , both quantities are zero unless @xmath96 contains a product of @xmath97 or @xmath98 along a non - contractible loop or cut .",
    "hence , the splitting appears only in the @xmath99-th or higher orders .",
    "as far as all things ( like the number of the relevant terms in @xmath96 ) scale correctly to the thermodynamic limit , the splitting vanishes as @xmath86 .",
    "a simple physical interpretation of this result is given in the next section .",
    "( of course , the perturbation should be small enough , or else a phase transition may occur ) .",
    "note that our construction is not restricted to square lattices .",
    "we can consider an arbitrary irregular lattice , like in fig .",
    "[ fig_lattice ] .",
    "moreover , such a lattice can be drawn on an arbitrary 2-d surface . on a compact orientable surface of genus @xmath3 ,",
    "the ground state is @xmath2-fold degenerate . in this case ,",
    "the splitting of the ground state is estimated as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the smallest dimension of the lattice .",
    "we see that the ground state degeneracy depends on the surface topology , so we deal with _",
    "topological quantum order_. on the other hand , there is a finite energy gap between the ground state and excited states , so all spatial correlation functions decay exponentially .",
    "this looks like a paradox  how do parts of a macroscopic system know about the topology if all correlations are already lost at small scales ?",
    "the answer is that there is long - range entanglement   which can not be expressed by simple correlation functions like @xmath100 .",
    "this entanglement reveals itself in the excitation properties we are going to discuss .",
    "let us classify low - energy excitations of the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "an eigenvector of this hamiltonian is an eigenvector of all the operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "an _ elementary excitation _ , or _ particle _ occurs if only one of the constraints @xmath101 , @xmath102 is violated .",
    "because of the relations @xmath24 and @xmath25 , it is impossible to create a single particle .",
    "however , it is possible to create a two - particle state of the form @xmath103 or @xmath104 , where @xmath67 is an arbitrary ground state , and @xmath105 ( see fig .  [ fig_strings ] ) . in the first case ,",
    "two particles are created at the endpoints of the `` string '' ( non - closed path ) @xmath106 .",
    "such particles live on the vertices of the lattice .",
    "we will call them @xmath107-type particles , or `` electric charges '' .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath108-type particles , or `` magnetic vortices '' live on the faces .",
    "the operators @xmath109 , @xmath110 are called _",
    "string operators_. their characteristic property is as follows : they commute with every @xmath15 and @xmath16 , except for few ones ( namely , 2 ) corresponding to the endpoints of the string .",
    "note that the state @xmath103 depends only on the homotopy class of the path @xmath106 while the operator @xmath109 depends on @xmath106 itself .    #",
    "0.6##20.6#0.6    any configuration of an even number of @xmath107-type particles and an even number of @xmath108-type particles is allowed .",
    "we can connect them by strings in an arbitrary way .",
    "each particle configuration defines a @xmath2-dimensional subspace in the global hilbert space @xmath19 .",
    "this subspace is independent of the strings but a particular vector @xmath111 depends on @xmath112 . if we draw these strings in a topologically different way , we get another vector in the same @xmath2-dimensional subspace .",
    "thus , the strings are unphysical but we can not get rid of them in our formalism .    let us see what happens if these particles move around the torus ( or other surface ) . moving a @xmath107-type particle along the path @xmath46 or @xmath47 ( see fig .  [ fig_loops ] ) is equivalent to applying the operator @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we can operate on the ground state space by creating a particle pair , moving one of the particles around the torus , and annihilating it with the other one .",
    "thus we can realize some quantum gates .",
    "unfortunately , too simple ones  we can only apply the operators @xmath61 and @xmath62 to each of the @xmath56 ( or @xmath113 ) qubits encoded in the ground state .",
    "now we can give the promised physical interpretation of the ground state splitting .",
    "in the presence of perturbation , the two - particle state @xmath114 is not an eigenstate any more .",
    "more exactly , both particles will propagate rather than stay at the same positions .",
    "the propagation process is described by the schrdinger equation with some effective mass @xmath115 .",
    "( @xmath108-type particles have another mass @xmath116 ) . in the non - perturbed model , @xmath117 .",
    "there are no real particles in the ground state , but they can be created and annihilate virtually .",
    "a virtual particle can tunnel around the torus before annihilating with the other one .",
    "such processes contribute terms @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 to the ground state effective hamiltonian . here",
    "@xmath122 is the tunneling amplitude whereas @xmath123 is the imaginary wave vector of the tunneling particle .    # 0.6##20.6#0.6    next question : what happens if we move particles around each other ?",
    "( for this , we do nt need a torus ; we can work on the plane ) .",
    "for example , let us move an @xmath108-type particle around a @xmath107-type particle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_movearou ] ) . then @xmath124 because @xmath125 and @xmath109 anti - commute , and @xmath126 .",
    "we see that the global wave function ( @xmath127 the state of the entire system ) acquires the phase factor @xmath18 .",
    "it is quite unlike usual particles , bosons and fermions , which do not change their phase in such a process .",
    "particles with this unusual property are called _",
    "abelian anyons_. more generally , abelian anyons are particles which realize nontrivial one - dimensional representations of ( colored ) braid groups . in our case , the phase change can be also interpreted as an aharonov - bohm effect . it does not occur if both particles are of the same type .    note that abelian anyons exist _ in real solid state systems _ , namely , they are intrinsicly related to the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "however , these anyons have different braiding properties . in the fractional quantum hall system with filling factor @xmath128",
    ", there is only one basic type of anyonic particles with ( real ) electric charge @xmath129 .",
    "( other particles are thought to be composed from these ones ) .",
    "when one particle moves around the other , the wave function acquires a phase factor @xmath130 .",
    "clearly , the existence of anyons and the ground state degeneracy have the same nature .",
    "they both are manifestations of a topological quantum order , a hidden long - range order that can not be described by any local order parameter .",
    "( the existence of a local order parameter contradicts the nature of a quantum code  if the ground state is accessible to local measurements then it is not protected from local errors ) .",
    "it seems that the anyons are more fundamental and can be used as a universal probe for this hidden order .",
    "indeed , _ the ground state degeneracy on the torus follows from the existence of anyons _",
    "@xcite . here is the original einarsson s proof applied to our two types of particles .",
    "we derived the ground state degeneracy from the commutation relations between the operators @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "these operators can be realized by moving particles along the loops @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "these loops only exist on the torus , not on the plane .",
    "consider , however , the process in which an @xmath108-type particle and a @xmath107-type particle go around the torus and then trace their paths backward .",
    "this corresponds to the operator @xmath131 which can be realized on the plane .",
    "indeed , we can deform particles trajectories so that one particle stays at rest while the other going around it .",
    "due to the anyonic nature of the particles , @xmath132 .",
    "we see that @xmath44 and @xmath42 anti - commute .",
    "the above argument is also applicable to the fractional quantum hall anyons  @xcite .",
    "the ground state on the torus is @xmath133-fold degenerate , up to the precision @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the magnetic length .",
    "this result does not rely on the magnetic translational symmetry or any other symmetry .",
    "rather , it relies on the existence of the energy gap in the spectrum ( otherwise the degeneracy would be unstable to perturbation ) .",
    "note that holes ( @xmath127punctures ) in the torus do not remove the degeneracy unless they break the nontrivial loops @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "the fly - over crossing geometry ( see fig .  [ fig_crossing ] ) is topologically equivalent to a torus with 2 holes , but it is almost flat . in principle , such structure can be manufactured  , cooled down and placed into a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "this will be a sort of quantum memory  it will store a quantum state forever , provided all anyonic excitation are frozen out or localized .",
    "unfortunately , i do not know any way this quantum information can get in or out .",
    "too few things can be done by moving abelian anyons .",
    "all other imaginable ways of accessing the ground state are uncontrollable .    # 0.6##20.6#0.6",
    "anyons have been studied extensively in the gauge field theory context  @xcite .",
    "however , we start with quite different assumptions about the hamiltonian .",
    "a gauge theory implies a gauge symmetry which can not be removed by external perturbation . to the contrary ,",
    "our model is stable to _ arbitrary _ local perturbations .",
    "it is useful to give a field - theoretic interpretation of this model .",
    "the edge labels @xmath65 ( measurable by @xmath97 ) correspond to a @xmath58 vector potential , whereas @xmath98 corresponds to the electric field .",
    "the operators @xmath15 are local gauge transformations whereas @xmath16 is the magnetic field on the face @xmath11 .",
    "the constraints @xmath101 mean that the state @xmath67 is gauge - invariant .",
    "violating the gauge invariance is energetically unfavorable but not forbidden .",
    "the hamiltonian ( which includes @xmath136 and some perturbation @xmath137 ) need not obey the gauge symmetry .",
    "the constraints @xmath63 mean that the gauge field corresponds to a flat connection .",
    "these constraints are not strict either .    despite the absence of symmetry in the hamiltonian @xmath138 , our system exhibits two conservation laws : electric charge and magnetic charge ( i.e.  the number of vortices ) are both conserved _ modulo _ 2 . in the usual electrodynamics , conservation of electric charge",
    "is related to the local ( @xmath127gauge ) @xmath139 symmetry . in our case",
    ", it should be a local @xmath58 symmetry for electric charges and another @xmath58 symmetry for magnetic vortices .",
    "so , our system exhibits a _ dynamically created _ @xmath140",
    "symmetry which appears only at large distances where individual excitations are well - defined .",
    "probably , the reader is not satisfied with this interpretation .",
    "really , it creates a new puzzle rather than solve an old one .",
    "what is this mysterious symmetry ? how do symmetry operators look like at the microscopic level ?",
    "the answer sounds as nonsense but it is true .",
    "this symmetry ( as well as any other local symmetry ) can be found in _ any _ hamiltonian if we introduce some unphysical degrees of freedom .",
    "so , the symmetry is not actually being created .",
    "rather , an artificial symmetry becomes a real one .",
    "the new degrees of freedom are spin variables @xmath141 for each vertex @xmath10 and each face @xmath11 .",
    "the vertex spins will stay in the state @xmath142 whereas the face spins will stay in the state @xmath143 .",
    "so , all the extra spins together stay in a unique quantum state @xmath144 .",
    "obviously , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , for every vertex @xmath10 and every face @xmath11 . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", we have simply defined an embedding of the space @xmath19 into a larger hilbert space @xmath147 of all the spins , @xmath148 .",
    "so we may write @xmath149 . we will call @xmath19 the _ physical space _ ( or subspace ) , @xmath147 the _ extended space_. physical states ( i.e.  vectors @xmath150 ) are characterized by the equations @xmath151 for every vertex @xmath10 and face @xmath11 .",
    "now let us apply a certain unitary transformation @xmath152 on the extended space @xmath147 .",
    "this transformation is just a change of the spin variables , namely @xmath153 ( all sums are taken _ modulo _ 2 ) .",
    "the physical subspace becomes @xmath154 .",
    "vectors @xmath155 are invariant under the following symmetry operators @xmath156 the transformed hamiltonian @xmath157 commutes with these operators .",
    "it is defined up to the equivalence @xmath158 , @xmath159 . in particular , @xmath160    in the field theory language , the vertex variables @xmath161 ( or the operators @xmath162 ) are a higgs field .",
    "the operators @xmath163 are local gauge transformations . thus , an arbitrary hamiltonian can be written in a gauge - invariant form if we introduce additional higgs fields .",
    "of course , it is a very simple observation .",
    "the real problem is to understand how the artificial gauge symmetry `` materialize '' , i.e.  give rise to a physical conservation law .    electric charge at a vertex @xmath10 is given by the operator @xmath164 .",
    "the total electric charge on a compact surface is zero .",
    "`` zero '' refers to the identity representation . ]",
    "because @xmath165 .",
    "this is not a physically meaningful statement as it is .",
    "it is only meaningful if there are discrete charged particles .",
    "then the charge is also conserved locally , in every scattering or fusion process .",
    "it is difficult to formulate this property in a mathematical language , but , hopefully , it is possible .",
    "( the problem is that particles are generally smeared and can propagate .",
    "physically , particles are well - defined if they are stable and have finite energy gap ) .",
    "alternatively , one can use various local and nonlocal order parameters to distinguish between phases with an unbroken symmetry , broken symmetry or confinement .",
    "the artificial gauge symmetry materialize for the hamiltonian  ( [ ham_gauge ] ) but this is not the case for every hamiltonian .",
    "let us try to describe possible symmetry breaking mechanisms in terms of local order parameters .",
    "if the gauge symmetry is broken then there is a nonvanishing vacuum average of the higgs field , @xmath166 .",
    "electric charge is not conserved any more . in other words",
    ", there is a bose condensate of charged particles .",
    "although the second @xmath58 symmetry is formally unbroken , free magnetic vortices do not exist .",
    "more exactly , magnetic vortices are confined .",
    "( the duality between symmetry breaking and confinement is well known  @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that the second symmetry is broken , then electric charges are confined . from the physical point of view , these two possibilities are equivalent : there is no conservation law in the system .    an interesting question is whether magnetic vortices can be confined without the gauge symmetry being broken .",
    "apparently , the answer is `` no '' .",
    "the consequence is significant : electric charges and magnetic vortices can not exist without each other .",
    "it seems that materialized symmetry needs better understanding ; as presented here , it looks more like a miracle .",
    "from now on , we are constructing and studying nonabelian anyons which will allow universal quantum computation .",
    "let @xmath167 be a finite ( generally , nonabelian ) group .",

    "one can take for @xmath169 any finite - dimensional hopf algebra equipped with a hermitian scalar product with certain properties .",
    "however , i do not want to make things too complicated .    to describe the model , we need to define 4 types of linear operators , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 acting on the space @xmath169 . within each type ,",

    "<S> magnetism arise from spins of individual atoms . </S>",
    "<S> each spin is quite sensitive to thermal fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> but the spins interact with each other and tend to be oriented in the same direction . </S>",
    "<S> if some spin flips to the opposite direction , the interaction forces it to flip back to the direction of other spins . </S>",

    "<S> yes , but it is not so simple . </S>",
