    "the progress in cosmology in the past few decades leads also to new insights into the global question of the emergence of intelligent life in the universe . here",
    "i am not referring to discoveries that are related to very localized regions , such as the detection of extrasolar planetary systems , but rather to properties of the universe at large .    in order to set the stage properly for the topics to follow ,",
    "i would like to start with four observations that essentially all astronomers agree with .",
    "these four observations _ define _ the cosmological context of our universe .    a.   _ redshift_. ever since the observations of vesto slipher in 19121922 ( slipher 1917 ) and hubble ( 1929 ) , we know that the spectra of distant galaxies are redshifted",
    ". b.   observations with the cosmic background explorer have shown that , to a precision of better than @xmath0 , the cosmic microwave background is _ thermal _ , at a temperature of 2.73  k ( mather et  al .",
    "1994 ) . c.",
    "light elements , such as deuterium and helium , have been synthesized in a high - temperature phase in the past ( e.g.  gamow 1946 ; alpher , bethe & gamow 1948 ; hoyle & tayler 1964 ; peebles 1966 ; wagoner , fowler & hoyle 1967 ) .",
    "d.   deep observations , such as the hubble deep field , have shown that galaxies in the distant universe look younger .",
    "namely , their sizes are smaller ( e.g.  roche et  al .",
    "1996 ) and there is a higher fraction of irregular morphologies ( e.g.  abraham et  al .",
    "this is what one would expect from a higher rate of interactions , and from `` building blocks '' of today s galaxies .",
    "when the above four observational facts are combined and considered together , there is no escape from the conclusion that our universe is _ expanding and cooling_. this conclusion is entirely _ consistent _ with the `` hot big bang '' model .",
    "sometimes the stronger statement , that these observations `` prove '' that there was a hot big bang , is made .",
    "however , the scientific method does not truly produce `` proofs . ''    during the past decade , deep observations with a variety of ground - based and space - based observatories have advanced our understanding of the history of the universe far beyond the mere statement that a big bang had occurred . in particular , remarkable progress has been achieved in the understanding of the cosmic star formation history .",
    "using different observational tracers ( e.g.  the uv luminosity density ) of star formation in high - redshift galaxies , tentative plots for the star - formation - rate ( sfr ) as a function of redshift have been produced ( e.g.  lilly et  al .  1996 ; madau et  al .",
    "1996 ; steidel et  al .",
    "there is little doubt that the sfr rises from the present to about @xmath1 .",
    "what happens in the redshift range @xmath15 is still somewhat controversial . while some studies suggest that the sfr reaches a peak at @xmath12 and then declines slightly towards higher redshifts ( e.g.  steidel et  al .",
    "1999 ) , or stays fairly flat up to @xmath2 ( e.g.  calzetti & heckman 1999 ; pei , fall , & hauser 1999 ) , others claim that the sfr continues to rise to @xmath3 ( lanzetta et  al .",
    "the latter claim is based on the suggestion that previous studies had failed to account for surface brightness dimming effects . for my present purposes , however , it is sufficient that the history of the _ global _ sfr is on the verge of being determined ( if it hasnt been determined already ) .",
    "a knowledge of the sfr as a function of redshift allows for the first time for meaningful constraints to be placed on the global emergence of carbon - based life .",
    "the main contributors of carbon to the interstellar medium are intermediate - mass ( 18  m@xmath4 ) stars ( e.g.  wood 1981 ; yungelson , tutukov & livio 1993 ; timmes , woosley , & weaver 1995 ) , through the asymptotic giant branch and planetary nebulae phases . a knowledge of the cosmic sfr history , together with a knowledge of the initial mass function ( imf ; presently still uncertain for high redshift ) , therefore allows for a calculation of the rate of carbon production as a function of redshift ( livio 1999 ) . for a peaked sfr , of the type obtained by madau et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , for example , the peak in the carbon production rate is somewhat delayed ( by @xmath5  billion years ) with respect to the sfr peak .",
    "the decline in the carbon production rate is also shallower for @xmath6 ( than the decline in the sfr ) , owing to the buildup of a stellar reservoir in the earlier epochs .    assuming a `` principle of mediocrity , '' one would expect the emergence of carbon - based life to be perhaps not too far from the peak in the carbon production rate  around @xmath1 ( for a peak in the sfr at @xmath12 ) .",
    "since the timescale required to develop intelligent civilizations may be within a factor two of the lifetime of f5 to mid - k stars ( the ones possessing continuously habitable zones , kasting , whitmore , & reynolds 1993 ; and see section  5 below ) , it can be expected that intelligent civilizations have emerged when the universe was @xmath7  gyr old .",
    "a younger emergence age may be obtained if the sfr does not decline at redshifts @xmath8 ( e.g.  lanzetta et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "carbon features in most anthropic arguments .",
    "in particular , it is often argued that the existence of an excited state of the carbon nucleus is a manifestation of fine - tuning of the constants of nature , that allowed for the appearance of carbon - based life .",
    "carbon is formed through the triple - alpha process in two steps . in the first , two alpha particles from the unstable ( lifetime @xmath9  s ) @xmath10be . in the second ,",
    "a third alpha particle is captures , via @xmath10be@xmath11c .",
    "hoyle argued that in order for the @xmath12 reaction to proceed at a rate sufficient to produce the observed cosmic carbon , a resonant level must exist in @xmath13c , a few hundred kev above the @xmath10be  + @xmath14he threshold . such a level was indeed found experimentally ( dunbar et  al .",
    "1953 ; hoyle , dunbar & wenzel 1953 ; cook , fowler & lauritsen 1957 ) .",
    "the question of how fine - tuned does this level need to be for the existence of carbon - based life is somewhat a matter of interpretation .",
    "the most recent work on this topic was done by oberhammer and collaborators ( e.g.  oberhammer , cst , & schlattl 2000 ; cst , oberhammer , & schlattl 2001 ) .",
    "these authors used a model that treats the @xmath13c nucleus as a system of twelve interacting nucleons , and the approximate resonant reaction rate @xmath15 here @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the mass and number density of alpha particles , respectively , @xmath18 is the resonance energy ( in the center - of - mass frame ) , @xmath19 is the relative width , and all other symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "oberhammer et  al .",
    "introduced small variations in the strengths of the nucleon - nucleon interaction and in the fine structure constant ( affecting @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , and calculated stellar models using the modified rates .",
    "they concluded that a change of more than 0.5% in the strength of the strong interaction or more than 4% in the strength of the electromagnetic interaction would result in essentially no production of carbon or oxygen ( considering the @xmath13c@xmath20o and @xmath21o@xmath22ne reactions ) in any star .",
    "more specifically , a decrease in the strong - interaction strength by 0.5% coupled with an increase in the fine structure constant by 4% resulted in a decrease in the carbon production by a factor of a few tens in 20  m@xmath4 stars , and by a factor of @xmath23100 in 1.3  m@xmath4 stars . taken at face value , this would seem to support anthropic claims for extreme fine - tuning necessary for the emergence of carbon - based life .",
    "however , the fine - tuning appears less impressive when the following two factors are considered .",
    "a.   calculations by hong & lee ( 1999 ) show that @xmath13c actually has an unstable resonant state of @xmath10be + @xmath24 ( as an asymmetric 3@xmath24 linear - chain structure ) .",
    "b.   calculations by livio et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) showed that shifting ( artificially ) the energy of the carbon resonant state by up to 0.06  mev does not result in a significant reduction in the production of carbon .",
    "given the results of hong & lee ( 1999 ) , this 0.06  mev should be compared to the _ difference _ between the unstable carbon state and the total energy of @xmath10be + @xmath24 , which is @xmath230.28  mev , and therefore not a particularly fantastic fine - tuning .",
    "in 1998 , two teams of astronomers , working independently , presented evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating ( riess et  al .  1998 ;",
    "perlmutter et  al .",
    "the evidence was based primarily on the unexpected faintness ( by @xmath230.25  mag ) of distant ( @xmath25 ) type  ia supernovae , compared to their expected brightness in a universe decelerating under its own gravity .",
    "the results favored values of @xmath26 , @xmath27 for the matter and `` dark energy '' density parameters , respectively .",
    "subsequent observations of the supernova sn1997ff , at the redshift of @xmath28 , strengthened the conclusion of an accelerating universe ( riess et  al .",
    "this supernova appeared _ brighter _ relative to sne in a coasting universe , as expected from the fact that at @xmath29 a universe with @xmath26 , @xmath27 would still be in its decelerating phase",
    ". the observations of sn1997ff do not support any alternative interpretation ( such as dust extinction or evolutionary effects ) in which supernovae are expected to dim monotonically with redshift .",
    "measurements of the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( e.g.  abroe et  al .  2002 ;",
    "netterfield et  al .",
    "2002 ; de  bernardis et  al .",
    "2002 ) provide strong evidence for flatness ( @xmath30 ) . when combined with estimates of @xmath31 based on mass - to - light ratios , x - ray temperature of intracluster gas , and dynamics of clusters (",
    "all of which give @xmath32 ; e.g.  carlberg et  al .  1996",
    "; strauss & willick 1995 ; bahcall et  al .  2000 ) , again a value of @xmath27 is obtained .",
    "arguably the two greatest puzzles physics is facing today are :    * why is the dark energy ( vacuum energy ) density , @xmath33 , so small , but not zero ? ( or : why does the vacuum energy gravitate so little ? ) * why _ now _ ?",
    "namely , why do we find at present that @xmath34 ?    the first question reflects the fact that taking graviton energies up to the planck scale , @xmath35 , would produce a dark energy density @xmath36 that misses the observed one , @xmath37 , by more than 120 orders of magnitude .",
    "even if the energy density in fluctuations in the gravitational field is taken only up to the supersymmetry breaking scale , @xmath38 , we still miss the mark by a factor of 60 orders of magnitude , since @xmath39 .",
    "interestingly though , a scale @xmath40 produces the right order of magnitude .",
    "however , while a few attempts in this direction have been made ( e.g.  arkani - hamed et  al .",
    "2000 ) , no satisfactory model has been developed .",
    "the second question is related to the anti - copernican fact that @xmath41 may be associated with a cosmological constant , while @xmath31 declines continuously , ( and in any case , @xmath33 may be expected to have a different time behavior from @xmath42 ) , and yet the first time that we are able to measure both reliably , we find that they are of the same order .    the attempts to solve these problems fall into three general categories :    a.   the behavior of `` quintessence '' fields , b.   alternative theories of gravity , and c.   anthropic considerations .",
    "the attempts of the first type have concentrated in particular on `` tracker '' solutions ( e.g.  zlatev , wang & steinhardt 1998 ; albrecht & skordis 2002 ) , in which the smallness of @xmath41 is a direct consequence of the universe s old age .",
    "generally , a uniform scalar field @xmath43 , is taken to evolve according to @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the energy density of the scalar field is given by @xmath47 and that of matter and radiation , @xmath42 , by ( @xmath48 is the pressure ) @xmath49 for a potential of the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 is an adjustable constant , @xmath53 ( and a field that is initially much smaller than the planck mass ) , one obtains a solution in which a transition occurs from an early @xmath42-dominance to a late @xmath54-dominance ( with no need to fine - tune the initial conditions ) .",
    "nevertheless , for the condition @xmath55 to actually be satisfied at the present time requires ( weinberg 2001 ) that the parameter @xmath52 would satisfy @xmath56 which is not easily explicable .    in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "some quintessence models choose potentials in which the universe has periodically been accelerating in the past ( e.g.  dodelson , kaplinghat , & stewart 2000 ) , so that the dark energy s dominance today appears naturally .",
    "a very different approach regards the accelerating expansion not as being propelled by dark energy , but rather as being the result of a modified gravity .",
    "for example , models have been developed ( deffayet , dvali , & gabadadze 2001 ) , in which ordinary particles are localized on a three - dimensional surface ( 3-brane ) embedded in infinite volume extra dimensions to which gravity can spread .",
    "the model is constructed in such a way that observers on the brane discover newtonian gravity ( four - dimensional ) at distances that are shorter than a crossover scale , @xmath57 , which can be of astronomical size . in one version ,",
    "the friedmann equation is replaced by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the total energy density , @xmath60 is the scale factor and @xmath61 .    in this case , the dynamics of gravity are governed by whether @xmath62 is larger or smaller than @xmath63 .",
    "choosing @xmath64 preserves the usual cosmological results . at large cosmic distances , however , gravity spreads into extra dimensions ( the force law becomes five - dimensional ) , and becomes weaker  directly affecting the cosmic expansion .",
    "basically , at late times , the model has a self - accelerating cosmological branch with @xmath65 ( to leading - order equation  ( 3.7 ) can be parameterized as @xmath66 ) .",
    "interestingly , it has recently been suggested that the viability of these models can be tested by lunar ranging experiments ( dvali , gruzinov , & zaldarriaga 2002 ) .",
    "a third class of proposed solutions to the dark energy problems relies on anthropic selection effects , and therefore on the _ existence _ of intelligent life in our universe .",
    "the basic premise of this approach is that some of the constants of nature are actually random variables , whose range of values and a  priori probabilities are nevertheless determined by the laws of physics .",
    "the observed big bang , in this picture , is simply one member of an ensemble .",
    "it is further assumed that a `` principle of mediocrity '' applies , namely , we can expect to observe the most probable values ( vilenkin 1995 ) . using this approach , garriga ,",
    "livio , & vilenkin ( 2000 ; following the original idea of weinberg 1987 ) were able to show that when the cosmological constant @xmath67 is the only variable parameter , the order of magnitude coincidence @xmath68 ( where @xmath69 is the present time ; @xmath70 is the time @xmath41 starts to dominate ; @xmath71 is the time when giant galaxies were assembled ) finds a natural explanation ( see also bludman 2000 ) .",
    "qualitatively , the argument works as follows .    in a geometrically flat universe with a cosmological constant",
    ", gravitational clustering can no longer occur after redshift @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is the present matter density ) .",
    "therefore , requiring that @xmath74 does not dominate before redshift @xmath75 , at which the earliest galaxies formed , requires ( e.g.  weinberg 1987 ) @xmath76 one can expect the a  priori ( independent of observers ) probability distribution @xmath77 to vary on some characteristic scale , @xmath78 , determined by the underlying physics .",
    "irrespective of whether @xmath79 is determined by the planck scale ( @xmath2310@xmath80  gev ) , the grand unification scale ( @xmath2310@xmath21  gev ) or the electroweak scale ( @xmath2310@xmath81  gev ) , @xmath82 exceeds the anthropically allowed range of @xmath74 ( eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) ) by so many orders of magnitude that it looks reasonable to assume that @xmath83 over the range of interest .",
    "garriga & vilenkin ( 2001 ) and weinberg ( 2001 ) have shown that this assumption is satisfied by a broad class of models , even though not automatically . with a flat distribution , a value of @xmath74 picked randomly ( and which may characterize a `` pocket '' universe ) from an interval @xmath84 , will , with a high probability , be of the order of @xmath85 .",
    "the principle of mediocrity , however , means that we should observe a value of @xmath74 that maximizes the number of galaxies .",
    "this suggests that we should observe the largest value of @xmath74 that is still consistent with a substantial fraction of matter having collapsed into galaxies  in other words , @xmath86 , as observed . in section  2",
    "i argued that the appearance of carbon - based life may be associated roughly with the peak in the star formation rate , @xmath87 .",
    "the `` present time , '' @xmath69 , is not much different from that ( in that it takes only a fraction of a stellar lifetime to develop intelligent life ) , hence @xmath88 . finally , hierarchical structure formation models suggest that vigorous star formation is closely associated with the formation of galactic - size objects ( e.g.  baugh et  al .  1998 ; fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) . therefore , @xmath89 , and we obtain @xmath90 .",
    "garriga et  al .",
    "( 2000 ) further expanded their discussion to treat not just @xmath67 , but also the density contrast at recombination , @xmath91 , as a random variable ( see also tegmark & rees 1998 ) . the galaxy formation in this case is spread over a much wider time interval , and proper account has to be taken for the fact that the cooling of protogalactic clouds collapsing at very late times is too slow for efficient fragmentation and star formation ( fragmentation occurs if the cooling timescale is shorter than the collapse timescale , @xmath92 ) . assuming an a  priori probability distribution of the form @xmath93 garriga et  al",
    ".  found that `` mediocre '' observers will detect @xmath94 , @xmath95 , as observed , _ if _ @xmath96 ( here the `` cooling boundary '' @xmath97 is the time after which fragmentation is suppressed ) .",
    "personally , i feel that anthropic explanations to the dark energy problems should be regarded as the _ last resort _",
    ", only after all attempts to find explanations based on first principles have been exhausted and failed . nevertheless , the anthropic explanation may prove to be the correct one , if our understanding of what is truly _ fundamental _ is lacking .",
    "a historical example can help to clarify this last statement .",
    "johannes kepler ( 15711630 ) was obsessed by the following two questions :    a.   why were there precisely six planets ?",
    "( only mercury , venus , earth , mars , jupiter and saturn were known at his time ) and b.   what was it that determined that the planetary orbits would be spaced as they are ?",
    "the first thing to realize is that these `` why '' and `` what '' questions were a novelty in the astronomical vocabulary .",
    "astronomers before kepler were usually satisfied with simply recording the observed positions of the planets ; kepler was seeking a theoretical explanation .",
    "kepler finally came up with preposterously fantastic ( and absolutely wrong ) answers to his two questions in _ mysterium cosmographicum _",
    ", published in 1597 .",
    "he suggested that the reason for there being six planets is that there are precisely five platonic solids .",
    "taken as boundaries ( with an outer spherical boundary corresponding to the fixed stars ) , the solids create six spacings . by choosing a particular order for the solids to be embedded in each other , with the earth separating the solids that can stand upright ( cube , tetrahedron , and dodecahedron ) from those that `` float '' ( octahedron and icosahedron ) ,",
    "kepler claimed to have explained the sizes of the orbits too ( the spacings agreed with observations to within 10% ) .",
    "today we recognize what was the _",
    "main _ problem with kepler s model ",
    "kepler did not understand that neither the number of planets nor their spacings are _ fundamental _ qualities that need to have an explanation from first principles .",
    "rather , both are the result of historical accidents in the solar protoplanetary disk .",
    "still , it is perfectly legitimate to give an anthropic `` explanation '' for the earth s orbital radius .",
    "if that orbit were not in the continuously habitable zone around the sun ( kasting & reynolds 1993 ) , we would not be here to ask the question .",
    "it is difficult to admit it , but our current model for the composition of the universe : @xmath2365% dark energy , @xmath2330% dark matter , @xmath234% baryonic matter , and @xmath230.5% neutrinos , appears no less preposterous than kepler s model . while some version of string theories may eventially provide a first - principles explanation for all of these values , it is also possible , in my opinion , that these individual values are in fact not fundamental , but accidental .",
    "maybe the only fundamental property is the fact that _ all the energy densities add up to produce a geometrically flat universe _ , as predicted by inflation ( guth 1981 ; hawking 1982 ; steinhardt & turner 1984 ) .",
    "clearly , for any anthropic explanation of the value of @xmath41 to be possible at all , even in principle , one requires the existence of a large ensemble of universes , with different values of @xmath41 .",
    "that this requirement may actually be fulfilled is precisely the concept of `` eternal inflation '' ( vilenkin 1983 ; steinhardt 1983 ; linde 1986 ; goncharov , linde , & mukhanov 1987 ) . in most inflationary models",
    "the timescale associated with the expansion is much shorter than the decay timescale of the false vacuum phase , @xmath98 .",
    "consequently , the emergence of a fractal structure of `` pocket universes '' surrounded by false vacuum material is almost inevitable ( guth 2001 ; for a different view see e.g.  bucher , goldhaber & turok 1995 ; turok 2001 )",
    ".    this ensemble of pocket universes may serve as the basis on which anthropic argumentation can be constructed ( even though the definition of probabilities on this infinite set is non - trivial ; see e.g.  linde , linde & mezhlumian 1995 ; vilenkin 1998 ) .",
    "another recent finding which , _ if confirmed _ , may have implications for the emergence of life in the universe , is that of cosmological evolution of the fine structure constant @xmath99 ( webb et  al .  1999 , 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "needless to say , life as we know it places significant anthropic constraints on the range of values allowed for @xmath24 .",
    "for example , the requirement that the lifetime of the proton would be longer than the main sequence lifetime of stars results in an upper bound @xmath100 ( ellis & nanopoulos 1981 ; barrow , sandvik & magueijo 2001 ) . the claimed detection of time variability was based on shifts in the rest wavelengths of redshifted uv resonance transitions observed in quasar absorption systems .",
    "basically , the dependence of observed wave number at redshift @xmath101 , @xmath102 , on @xmath24 can be expressed as @xmath103 where @xmath104 represent relativistic corrections for particular atomic masses and electron configurations , and @xmath105 here @xmath106 represent the present day and redshift-@xmath101 values of @xmath24 , respectively . by analyzing a multitude of absorption lines from many multiplets in different ions , such as feii and mgii transitions , in 28 absorption systems ( in the redshift range @xmath107 ) , and niii , crii , znii , and siiv transitions in some 40 absorption systems ( in the redshift range @xmath108 ) , webb et  al .",

    "murphy et  al .  ( 2001 ) conducted a comprehensive search for systematic effects that could potentially be responsible for the result ( e.g.  laboratory wavelength errors , isotopic abundance effects , heliocentric corrections during the quasar integration , line blending , and atmospheric dispersion ) . while they concluded that isotopic abundance evolution and atmospheric dispersion could have an effect , this was in the direction of actually amplifying the variation in @xmath24 ( to @xmath113 ) .",
    "the most recent results of webb et  al",
    ".  are not inconsistent with limits on @xmath24 from the oklo natural uranium fission reactor ( that was active @xmath114 years ago , corresponding to @xmath115 ) and with constraints from experimental tests of the equivalence principle .",
    "the former suggests @xmath116 ( fuji et  al .",
    "2000 ) , and the latter _ allows _ for a variation of the magnitude observed in the context of a general dynamical theory relating variations of @xmath24 to the electromagnetic fraction of the mass density in the universe ( livio & stiavelli 1998 ; bekenstein 1982 ) .",
    "before going any further , i would like to note that what is desperately needed right now is an independent confirmation ( or refutation ) of the results of webb et  al .  by other groups , both through additional ( and preferably different ) observations and via independent analysis of the data .",
    "in this respect it is important to realize that the reliability of the sne  ia results ( concerning the accelerating universe ) was enormously enhanced by the fact that two separate teams ( the supernova cosmology project and the high-@xmath101 supernova team ) reached the same conclusion independently , using different samples and different data analysis techniques . a first small step in the direction of testing the variable @xmath24 result came from measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) . a likelihood analysis of boomerang and maxima data , allowing for the possibility of a time - varying @xmath24 ( which , in turn , affects the recombination time ) found that in general the data may prefer a smaller @xmath24 in the past ( although the conclusion is not free of degeneracies ; avelino et  al .",

    ", the careful analysis of bahcall et  al .  has cast some serious doubts on the ability of the `` many - multiplet '' method employed by webb and his collaborators to actually reach the accuracy required to measure fractional variations in @xmath24 at the @xmath121 level .",

    "i should also note right away that @xmath122 can not exceed @xmath123 at the time of nucleosynthesis , not to be in conflict with the yield of @xmath14he ( e.g.  bergstrm , igury & rubinstein 1999 ) .    on the theoretical side , simple cosmological models with a varying fine structure constant",

    "the general equations describing a geometrically flat , homogeneous , isotropic , variable-@xmath24 universe are ( sandvik et  al .  2002 ; beckenstein 1982 ; livio & stiavelli 1998 ) the friedmann equation ( with @xmath124 ) @xmath125~~,\\ ] ] the evolution of the scalar field varying @xmath24 ( @xmath126 ) @xmath127 and the conservation equations for matter and radiation @xmath128 here , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath74 are the densities of matter , radiation , scalar field ( @xmath132 ) , and vacuum respectively , @xmath133 is the scale factor ( @xmath134 ) , @xmath135 is the coupling constant of the dynamic langrangian ( @xmath136 is a length scale of the theory ) , and @xmath137 is a dimensionless parameter that represents the fraction of mass in coulomb energy of an average nucleon compared to the free proton mass .",
    "equations  ( 4.5)(4.8 ) were solved numerically by sandvik et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and barrow et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , assuming a negative value of the parameter @xmath138 , and the results are interesting both from a purely cosmological point of view and from the perspective of the emergence of life .",
    "first , the results are consistent with both the claims of a varying @xmath24 of webb et  al .",
    "( which , as i noted , badly need further confirmation ) and with the more secure , by now , observations of an accelerating universe ( riess et  al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et  al .  1999 ) , while complying with the geological and nucleosynthetic constraints .",
    "second , barrow et  al .  find that @xmath24 remains almost constant in the radiation - dominated era , experiences a small logarithmic time increase during the matter - dominated era , but approaches a constant value again in the @xmath67-dominated era .",
    "this behavior has interesting anthropic consequences .",
    "the existence of a non - zero vacuum energy contribution is now _ required _ in this picture to dynamically stabilize the fine structure constant . in a universe with zero @xmath67",
    ", @xmath24 would continue to grow in the matter - dominate era to values that would make the emergence of life impossible ( barrow et  al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "clearly , the viability of all of the speculative ideas above rely at this point on the confirmation or refutation of time - varying constants of nature .",
    "with the discovery of @xmath23100 massive extrasolar planets ( mayor & queloz 1995 ; marcy & butler 1996 , 2000 ) , the question of the potential existence of extraterrestrial , galactic , intelligent life has certainly become more intriguing than ever . this topic has attracted much attention and generated many speculative ( by necessity ) probability estimates . nevertheless , in a quite remarkable paper , carter ( 1983 ) concluded on the basis of the near - equality between the lifetime of the sun , @xmath139 , and the timescale of biological evolution on earth , @xmath140 , that extraterrestrial intelligent civilizations are exceedingly rare in the galaxy .",
    "most significantly , carter s conclusion is supposed to hold even if the conditions optimal for the emergence of life are relatively common .",
    "let me reproduce here , very briefly , carter s argument .",
    "the basic , and very crucial assumption on which the argument is based is that the lifetime of a star , @xmath141 , and the timescale of biological evolution on a planet around that star , @xmath140 ( taken here , for definiteness , to be the timescale for the appearance of complex land life ) are a  priori _",
    "entirely independent_. in other words , the assumption is that land life appears at some _ random _ time with respect to the main - sequence lifetime of the star . under this assumption ,",
    "one expects that generally one of the two relations @xmath142 or @xmath143 applies ( the set where @xmath144 is of negligible measure for two independent quantitities ) .",
    "let us examine each one of these possibilities .",
    "if _ generally _ @xmath143 , it is very difficult to understand why in the first system found to contain complex land life , the earth - sun system , the two timescales are nearly equal , @xmath144 .",
    "if , on the other hand , _ generally _ @xmath142 , then clearly the first system we find must exhibit @xmath144 ( since for @xmath142 complex land life would not have developed ) . therefore , one has to conclude that _ typically _",
    "@xmath142 , and that consequently complex land life will generally not develop  the earth is an extremely rare exception .",
    "carter s argument is quite powerful and not easily refutable .",
    "its basic assumption ( the independence of @xmath140 and @xmath141 ) appears on the face of it to be solid , since @xmath141 is determined primarily by nuclear burning reactions , while @xmath140 is determined by biochemical reactions and the evolution of species .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the star is the main energy source for biological evolution ( light energy exceeds the other sources by 23 orders of magnitude ; e.g.  deamer 1997 ) , already implies that the two quantities are not completely independent .",
    "let me first take a purely mathematical approach and examine what would it take for the condition @xmath144 to be satisfied in the earth - sun system _ without _ implying that extraterrestrial intelligent life is extremely rare .",
    "imagine that @xmath140 and @xmath141 are not independent , but rather that @xmath145 where @xmath146 is some _ monotonically increasing _ function in the narrow range @xmath147 that allows the emergence of complex land life through the existence of continuously habitable zones ( corresponding to stellar spectral types f5 to mid - k ; kasting et  al .",
    "note that for a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function the distribution of stellar lifetimes behaves as @xmath148 consequently , if relation  ( 5.1 ) were to hold , it would in fact be the _ most probable _ that in the first place where we encounter an intelligent civilization we would find that @xmath149 , as in the earth - sun system . in other words , if we could identify some processes that are likely to produce a monotonically increasing ( @xmath141 ; @xmath150 ) relation , then the near equality of @xmath140 and @xmath141 in the earth - sun system would find a natural explanation , with no implications whatsoever for the frequency of intelligent civilizations .",
    "a few years ago , i proposed a simple toy - model of how such a relation might arise ( livio 1999 ) .",
    "the toy - model was based on the assumption that the appearance of land life has to await the build - up of a sufficient layer of protective ozone ( berkner & marshall 1965 ; hart 1978 ) , and on the fact that oxygen in a planet s atmosphere is released in the first phase from the dissociation of water ( hart 1978 ; levine , hays , & walker 1979 ) .",
    "given that the duration of this phase is inversely proportioned to the intensity of radiation in the 10002000    range , a relation between @xmath140 and @xmath141 can be established .",
    "in fact , a simple calculation gave @xmath151 precisely the type of monotonic relation needed .",
    "i should be the first to point out that the toy - model above is nothimg more than that  a toy model .",
    "it does point out , however , that at the very least , establishing a link between the biochemical and astrophysical timescales may not be impossible .",
    "clearly , the emergence of complex life on earth required many factors operating together .",
    "these include processes that appear entirely accidental , such as the stabilization of the earth s tilt against chaotic evolution by the moon ( e.g.  laskar , joutel , & boudin 1993 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we should not be so arrogant as to conclude everything from the one example we know .",
    "the discovery of many `` hot jupiters '' ( giant planets with orbital radii @xmath152  au ) has already demonstrated that the solar system may not be typical .",
    "we should keep an open mind to the possibility that biological complexity may find other paths to emerge , making various `` accidents , '' coincidences , and fine - tuning unnecessary . in any case , the final scientific assessment on life in the universe will probably come from biologists and observers  not from speculating theorists like myself .",
