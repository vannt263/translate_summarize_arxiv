    "two - dimensional graphene has emerged as a natural candidate for developing `` beyond cmos '' nanoelectronics  @xcite . in addition to the reported huge charge mobilities ,",
    "the weak intrinsic spin - orbit coupling in carbon - based @xmath1 structures  @xcite could potentially allow for very large ( micron long ) spin diffusion lengths .",
    "these features , together with the other `` semi - conductor like '' properties of graphene , make graphene - based spintronic devices highly promising  @xcite and have triggered a quest for controlling spin injection in graphene  @xcite .",
    "many routes have been attempted to induce magnetism by proximity effect or inject spins from magnetic electrodes  @xcite .",
    "another , more intrinsic , possibility is shaping the geometry of graphene by designing graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges . this has been found to induce localized edge magnetic states which can serve as a conceptually new building block for spintronics  @xcite .",
    "the existence of intrinsic magnetism driven by atomic - scale defects ( such as vacancies , chemisorbed species , grain boundaries , ... ) has been also suggested theoretically  @xcite , but remains fiercely debated on the experimental side  @xcite .",
    "it is indeed particularly difficult to achieve a precise experimental characterization of those defects , whereas the control of their density , positioning , or chemical reactivity seems an insurmountable challenge , jeopardizing a further use of magnetic properties in real devices .",
    "additionally , the absence of a true energy gap in two - dimensional graphene limits the elaboration of active graphene - based devices and circuits with standard semiconductor technologies .    other route to make graphene",
    "magnetic is either chemisorption of odd number of adatoms or functional groups  @xcite , or using magnetism on zigzag edges  @xcite . in the first case the stability of magnetic configurations at room temperature",
    "can be easily destroyed by the migration of adatoms with turning the system into nonmagnetic configuration  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the adatom based magnetism edge  @xcite and vacancy  @xcite magnetism in graphite is stable at room temperature .",
    "but herewith localization of the magnetic moments on the edges provides formation of the afm exchange interactions between two edges  @xcite .",
    "the case of graphene nanoribbons obey lieb s theorem because the localized electrons on one edge belong to sublattice a and localized electrons from other edge to sublattice b. magnetism on the edges of graphene nanoflakes is also described by this theorem  @xcite",
    ". electron localization plays an important role in the different many - body effects on graphene edges  @xcite and bulk graphene  @xcite .",
    "understanding the nature of the electron localization and delocalization in graphene and related systems is necessary not only for control and manipulation of magnetism in studied compounds but also for the development of knowledge about systems with strongly correlated electrons .",
    "graphene nanomesh ( further gnm ) is the intermediate compound between graphene nanoribbons with localized electrons on zigzag edges and perfect bulk graphene with delocalized electrons .",
    "the fabrication of gnm , using block copolymer lithography and offering versatility in varying periodicities and neck widths down to 5 nm  @xcite , could circumvent the hurdles .",
    "indeed , such technique allows a scalable engineering of superlattices of large graphene vacancies whose density , shape and distribution can be controlled down to the nanoscale .",
    "additionally , gnm - based field - effect transistors were shown to withstand current densities two orders of magnitudes larger than individual graphene nanoribbon devices , with comparable on / off ratio and easily tunable by varying the neck width . moreover , in accordance to the well - established lieb s theorem  @xcite , the possibility to control inner edge structures  @xcite of nanomesh vacancies could enable a true control of intrinsic magnetic properties .    in this paper , we present first - principles calculations of electronic and magnetic properties of graphene nanomesh , and found that by varying the shape , different types of intrinsic ferrimagnetic  @xcite states can be obtained with clear identification of optimal conditions .",
    "systematic studies of non - passivated and hydrogen - passivated gnm are achieved by varying the difference ( ) between missing a and b sites of the underlying bipartite lattice and analyzing different hole geometries . for non - passivated gnm with @xmath2 ,",
    "stable non - magnetic states are found for armchair edge termination , while zigzag edge terminations result in antiferromagnetic ground states .",
    "these localized magnetic moments however vanish when all edge c - atoms are hydrogen - passivated . in sharp contrast , when @xmath3 , stable ferri(o)magnetic states are induced with net moment up to 4  @xmath4 ( per 6 @xmath5 6 unit cell ) originating from dangling bonds of edge atoms .",
    "furthermore , for hydrogen - passivated gnm , the formation energy is dramatically decreased , and ground state is found to strongly depend on the vacancies shape and size .",
    "our calculations reveal the existence of three magnetic regimes which depend on @xmath6 : ( i ) highly magnetic gnms obeying lieb s theorem corresponding to triangular shaped holes with even a+b ; ( ii ) gnms with quenched magnetic state due to complete chemical bond reconstruction with @xmath7 and trivially nonmagnetic state with @xmath2 ; and ( iii ) gnms following intermediate regime between magnetic and quenched magnetic states , i.e. triangular gnms with odd a+b and more complicated structures including both even ( e.g. sector shaped gnm ) and odd ( e.g. pentagon shaped gnm ) a+b .",
    "we show that large triangular gnms could be as robust as non - triangular gnms providing possible solution to overcome one of crucial challenges for the sp - magnetism .",
    "moreover , significant exchange splitting values as large as @xmath0  ev can be obtained for highly asymmetric structures evidencing the potential of graphene nanomesh for room temperature carbon based spintronics .",
    "first - principles calculations were performed using vienna @xmath8 simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite based on density functional theory ( dft ) with generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for exchange correlation potential .",
    "we have used projected augmented wave method ( paw )  @xcite with the perdew - becke - erzenhof ( pbe ) parametrization  @xcite potentials to describe the core electrons of carbon .",

    "the total energy calculations reveal quite large magnetic interaction energies . for instance",
    ", the energy difference between ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin - polarized and paramagnetic ( pm ) state is found to be 0.129 ev per edge atom .",
    "the spin configuration is further stabilized by 0.093 ev per edge atom as a result of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) coupling between neighboring atoms with magnetic moment of 0.48  @xmath4 per edge atom for each spin on each sublattice with opposite orientation .",

    "( b ) energy difference between ferrimagnetic and paramagnetic states.,width=8 ]    dangling bonds at the edge c atoms of non - passivated gnm are strongly chemically reactive@xcite , which leads to hole formation energy of pure gnm higher than 1 ev / c [ see  table [ table : table i ] ]",

    "it is interesting to note that lieb s theorem was originally formulated for even a+b number of atoms , and indeed the obtained values for @xmath32 and t@xmath17 follow lieb s theorem predictions .",

    "this regime provides a root towards design of magnetic gnm supermeshes .",
    "it is worth to note that the possible mechanism for the deviation from the lieb s theorem of the moment value for the sector shape gnm s@xmath20 compared to t@xmath15 where a+b is even for both , could be attributed to larger amount of armchair edges ( not favorable for moment formation ) in s@xmath20 structure .",

    "furthermore , three magnetic regimes are revealed : ( i ) highly magnetic gnm obeying lieb s theorem ; ( ii ) quenched magnetic state due to complete chemical bond reconstruction ; and ( iii ) intermediate regime providing a possible root towards design of magnetic gnm supermeshes .",
