    "we are stressing the fact that notable regions of full chaos have been discovered in billiards with elliptical arcs and piecewise flat boundaries , indicating that such billiards deserve further attention@xcite . in our previous work we analyzed several types of billiards with noncircular arcs ( parabolic , hyperbolic , elliptical and generalized power - law ) , exhibiting mixed dynamics@xcite .",

    "the angle @xmath66 needed in the calculation is given as    @xmath138    the curvature radius at this point is given as    @xmath139    the chords are @xmath140    and    @xmath141    if we define @xmath142 as in ( 19 ) , the trace of the deviation matrix is again given by ( 20 ) and the orbit is stable if @xmath143 .",
    "when we substitute the calculated values of @xmath120 , @xmath116 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 into ( 19 ) , we obtain @xmath74 for all allowed shapes and conclude that the hour - glass orbit is neutral .",
    "this means that in the truncated elliptical billiards ( teb ) there is no stable hour - glass orbit , at variance with the elliptical stadium billiard ( esb ) , where such an orbit having interesting properties was stable in a large fraction of the parameter space@xcite . besides the diamond and multidiamond orbits , in fig .",
    "6 one discerns the presence of another , `` 8-shaped '' , stable orbit , shown in fig .",
    "in this section we return to the question of limits within which the truncated elliptical billiard is fully chaotic . here",
    "we test these limits numerically , with the help of the box - counting method@xcite .",
    "we calculate the poincar ' e sections for a chosen pair of shape parameters , starting with @xmath146 randomly chosen sets of initial conditions and iterating each orbit for @xmath147 intersections with the x - axis , thus obtaining @xmath148 points in the poincar ' e diagram .",
    "then we divide the first quadrant of the phase plane into a grid of @xmath149 squares ( boxes ) , count the number of boxes which have points in them and calculate the ratio of this number to the total number of boxes .",
    "the obtained ratio is denoted by @xmath150 . in this way",
    "also certain points belonging to invariant curves within the regular islands are included .",
    "but since our main aim is to examine the onset of full chaos , this method gives satisfactory results , providing that the appropriate values of @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath112 are used .",
    "detailed testing has shown that reliable results are obtained for values @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 used in our present calculation@xcite .    in fig .",
    "7 we plot in the @xmath154 plane the points representing the pairs of shape parameters .",
    "points are plotted in different colors , depending on the corresponding value of @xmath155 .",
    "the full chaos , corresponding to @xmath156 , is depicted by black points .",
    "colored points denote shapes within intervals between 0 and 0.99 .",
    "this diagram confirms that for the truncated elliptical billiards ( teb ) , in the region below the onset of the stable two - bounce horizontal orbit , dynamics is practically completely chaotic .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the behavior of the elliptical stadium billiard for which the similar diagram is shown in fig .",
    "8 . for the esb",
    "billiards the region of chaos was strictly bounded also from the lower side and determined by emergence of stable pantographic orbits .    to examine the possible mechanism for this difference",
    ", we assume that the teb and the esb billiards are two extreme cases and search for a possible transition between them .",
    "in this section we propose a new large class of stadium - like billiards which we call generalized truncated elliptical stadium - like billiards ( gtesb ) .",
    "such a billiard depends on three shape parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath157 .",
    "the allowed values of the shape parameters are    @xmath158    for the limiting values of @xmath157 we obtain the two billiard families considered before : for @xmath159 gtesb reduces to the elliptical stadium billiard ( esb ) , and for @xmath160 gtesb becomes the truncated elliptical billiard ( teb ) .",
    "the new gtesb billiard boundary is obtained by adding elliptical arcs symmetrically at the two opposite ends of a rectangle with sides @xmath10 and @xmath7 .",
    "elliptical arcs are cut out from the two identical but generally detached ellipses by two horizontal straight lines at @xmath161 ( fig .",
    "the two ellipses have centers at the points    @xmath162    the distance between the two centers is @xmath163 .",
    "the horizontal and vertical semiaxis are given , respectively , as    @xmath164    and    @xmath165\\ ] ]    and the equation of the two ellipses reads    @xmath166    the horizontal diameter of the billiard is 2 . for @xmath159 and @xmath167",
    "the gtesb becomes the bunimovich stadium billiard .    in fig .",
    "10 the poincar ' e sections are shown for @xmath168 and @xmath169 with @xmath157 assuming different values between -1 and 1 .",
    "the four islands typical for the bow - tie orbit are present for all @xmath157 except for @xmath160 ( teb ) , where this orbit becomes neutral and the island reduces to a caracteristical flight of points .",
    "the limits separating chaotic from mixed behavior are determined by the onset of the stable horizontal 2-bounce orbit and are given by ( 29 ) . since the curvature radius at @xmath28 is    @xmath170}{2(1-\\delta)(1+\\delta\\kappa)}\\ ] ]    the upper limit of chaos is determined by the condition    @xmath171    in fig .",
    "11 the chaotic fraction @xmath155 is shown for the special case @xmath126 for different @xmath157 , in dependence on @xmath1 .",
    "it is noticed that in the case @xmath159 ( esb ) there is a narrow , strictly limited region of full chaos , outside of which the values of @xmath155 are low . for @xmath160 ( teb )",
    "the fully chaotic region is much larger and extends practically over all values @xmath0 and @xmath1 below the chaotic limit . between these two limits , the regions of full chaos ( @xmath172 ) are shorter and limited , but there are many shapes with chaotic parameter close to 1 ( between 0.90 and 0.99 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a selection of narrow islands in the poincar ' e plots , as seen in fig .",
    "in conclusion , our investigation of the elliptical stadium - like billiards has revealed a rich variety of integrable , mixed and chaotic behavior , which is connected with the character of the two elliptical arcs and with their mutual position .",
    "this strong dependence on parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 is confirmed for the truncated elliptical billiards , but is even more enhanced when a third shape parameter @xmath157 is added .",
    "analysis shows , however , that among all considered shapes the truncated elliptical billiard ( teb ) , created by cutting a single ellipse with two parallel straight lines , has exceptional properties , notably that it is chaotic practically in the whole region of elongated elliptical arcs .",
    "notable is the presence of many neutral orbits in this region , consistent with the fact that these orbits actually can be identified as orbits in an ellipse . for the flattened arcs ,",
    "the stable islands due to the two - bounce horizontal orbit and to the diamond and multidiamond orbits occupy an important part of the phase plane",
    ".    our investigations can be useful for the experimental application of billiards in the laser technology , where properties and directional intensities of the optical microresonators depend strongly on the boundary shape .",
    "they can also be applied in designing the semiconducting optical devices and in the technology of microwave and acoustic resonant cavities . with this purpose in mind ,",
    "we propose further analysis of the stadium - like billiards with elliptical arcs and an extension of the present investigation to different types of open billiards .",
