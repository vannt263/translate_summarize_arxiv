    "<S> we take a different approach and classify the indecomposable young permutation modules . </S>",
    "<S> we also determine precisely when a young permutation module has direct summands occurring in more than one block . </S>",
    "<S> we summarise these results as :    [ thm : indecpartitions ] let @xmath12 and let @xmath13 be a partition of @xmath2 , then    a.   if @xmath0 is odd , then @xmath4 is indecomposable if , and only if , one of the following holds : * @xmath0 divides @xmath2 and @xmath13 is equal to @xmath14 or @xmath15 ; * @xmath0 does not divide @xmath2 and @xmath16 . b.   if @xmath17 , then @xmath4 is indecomposable if , and only if , one of the following holds : * @xmath2 is odd and @xmath16 * @xmath2 is even and @xmath16 or @xmath13 is one of the @xmath18 partitions @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and for each @xmath21 the non - negative integer @xmath22 is such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if either @xmath0 is odd , or @xmath17 and @xmath2 is odd , then @xmath4 is decomposable if , and only if , it has summands lying outside of the principal block . if @xmath17 and @xmath2 is even then @xmath4 has direct summands lying outside of the principal block if , and only if @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> this has applications to the study of the endomorphism algebras of young permutation modules . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath13 is a partition of @xmath2 with at most @xmath18 parts then the schur algebra @xmath27 has an idempotent @xmath28 ( described explicitly in @xcite ) for which @xmath29 is isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , studying the endomorphism algebras of young permutation modules gives information on the structure of schur algebras . by determining the indecomposable young permutation modules , we have determined for which @xmath13 the algebra @xmath29 is local .    </S>",
    "<S> when the characteristic @xmath0 is at least @xmath31 , it follows by theorem [ thm : indecpartitions ] that the partitions of @xmath2 indexing the indecomposable young permutation modules are very easily understood . to demonstrate the ease of computation when @xmath17 , we give the following two examples .    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> we apply theorem [ thm : indecpartitions ] to calculate the indecomposable young permutation modules of degree @xmath32 over a field of characteristic @xmath9 . in this case @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> hence there are precisely seven partitions @xmath35 of @xmath32 which correspond to indecomposable young permutation modules , the first of these is @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining six such partitions correspond to @xmath19 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the indecomposable young permutation modules for @xmath46 are : @xmath47 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath48 for some @xmath49 and let @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath4 is indecomposable if , and only if , @xmath16 or @xmath51 for @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof of theorem [ thm : indecpartitions ] is the subject of section 3 . </S>",
    "<S> this material can be read independently of section 2 , except for relying on a particular calculation - namely example [ ex : r-2,1,1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the partitions for which @xmath4 has summands in more than one block are found by analysis of the ordinary characters of the permutation modules using the littlewood  </S>",
    "<S> richardson rule . </S>",
    "<S> this , along with a dimension argument is enough to classify the indecomposable young permutation modules over fields of odd characteristic . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining cases in characteristic @xmath17 are solved by analysis of the @xmath9-kostka numbers for @xmath9-part partitions as determined by henke ( see @xcite ) . to conclude section 3 </S>",
    "<S> we show that the partitions indexing the indecomposable young permutation modules in characteristic @xmath9 are preserved by multiplication by @xmath9 and also when adding certain @xmath9-powers . </S>"
