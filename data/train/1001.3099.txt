    "the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) is a space - based gravitational - wave detector that can observe the merger of supermassive black holes in a binary with signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) of hundreds to thousands .",
    "so far , it has not been possible to predict the rate of mergers in the universe , and the event rate for lisa , with any precision .",
    "the initial seed black holes could have masses anywhere in the range @xmath2-@xmath3 depending on the formation scenario .",
    "collapse of metal - free massive stars at @xmath4 could lead to _ light _",
    "seeds , with masses of a few hundred solar masses @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "gravitational instability of massive proto - galactic disks could lead to the formation at @xmath5 of _ heavy _ seeds with masses @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these black hole seeds might grow by _ prolonged _ accretion whereby in - falling matter has a constant angular momentum direction and spins - up the black hole @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the seeds might grow by chaotic accretion associated with sporadic in - fall of small amounts of matter from a fragmented disc @xcite .",
    "the merger history in lisa s past light - cone depends on how black holes formed and evolved .",
    "if seed black holes were heavy , then one expects several tens of mergers per year and lisa will observe all of them . if the seeds were small then the rate in lisa s past light cone could be two to three times larger , but lisa s sensitivity to smaller black holes will be poorer and the number of mergers observed is again a few tens per year .",
    "of these , a handful of events might be close enough to be useful for cosmography @xcite .",
    "lisa may open a new era for precision cosmography since black hole binaries are _ self - calibrating standard sirens _ @xcite . in astronomy ,",
    "a standard candle is a source whose absolute luminosity can be deduced from certain observed properties such as the time - variability of its light - curve , spectral characteristics , etc .",
    "analogously , the term _ standard siren _ is used for binary black holes , since the way gravitational waves interact with matter is more akin to sound waves , although , of course , they are transverse waves traveling at the speed of light .",
    "black holes are also _ self - calibrating _ since they do nt need other measures of distance to calibrate their luminosity .",
    "this is because the luminosity of a binary black hole depends only on its chirp mass of a binary of total mass @xmath7 and reduced mass @xmath8 is @xmath9 . ] and its luminosity distance from lisa . for a chirping binary ,",
    "i.e. , a binary whose gravitational - wave frequency changes by an observable amount during the course of observation , one can deduce the chirp mass and measure its amplitude and thereby infer its luminosity distance .",
    "therefore , binary black holes can provide a new calibration for the high redshift universe avoiding all the lower rungs of the cosmic distance ladder .",
    "supermassive binary black hole ( smbbh ) mergers are , therefore , potential tools for cosmology",
    ". indeed , a single smbbh observation by lisa might already significantly constrain the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath1 @xcite . from the gravitational waveform ,",
    "one obtains the luminosity distance , @xmath10 . due to lisa s orbital motion over the observation time , one",
    "can also obtain an approximate sky position .",
    "if this allows for localization of the host galaxy , then redshift @xmath11 can be measured .",
    "since the relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath11 depends sensitively on @xmath1 ( among other cosmological parameters ) , the latter can then be constrained .",
    "one of the hurdles in availing of lisa for cosmology was that lisa s angular resolution might not be good enough to localize the host galaxy  a step that is crucial for obtaining the redshift of the source .",
    "however , more recent work has mitigated this hurdle by showing that the use of the full signal waveform , which contains not only the dominant harmonic at twice the orbital frequency @xmath12 but also other harmonics @xmath13 @xmath14 in parameter estimation can improve the angular resolution to a level that enables the localization of the source for a large fraction of systems in lisa s band @xcite .",
    "the sub - dominant harmonics , therefore , are essential for precision cosmology with lisa .",
    "the above conclusions have mainly been drawn by computing the covariance matrix of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters associated with an smbbh .",
    "a binary consisting of non - spinning black holes on a quasi - circular orbit is characterized by nine parameters : the chirp mass @xmath15 and reduced mass @xmath8 , a radial vector @xmath16 giving the location of the source , the orientation of the angular momentum @xmath17 at a fiducial time , the epoch of merger @xmath18 , and the signal s phase @xmath19 at that epoch .",
    "the information matrix ( inverse of the covariance matrix ) tends to be rather ill - conditioned and it is necessary to exercise a lot of care in its computation and inversion .",
    "several groups have independently confirmed the measurement accuracies and it is now widely believed that sub - dominant harmonics truly bring about a dramatic improvement in the estimation of parameters @xcite .",
    "one of the implications is that lisa will be able to measure the masses of the component black holes very accurately and obtain the mass function of ( seed ) black holes .",
    "localizing the source well enough for its host galaxy to be identified is crucial for measuring @xmath1 , since a knowledge of the redshift is needed .",
    "one may then ask how parameter estimation in general benefits from a knowledge of the sky position . in the full 9-dimensional parameter space , @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "are partially correlated with the other 7 parameters .",
    "the associated degeneracies in parameter estimation get broken if @xmath22 are exactly known .",
    "the covariance matrix then gets reduced from a @xmath23 to a @xmath24 matrix , leading to smaller uncertainties @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown how the inclusion of sub - dominant signal harmonics allows for a sufficiently good localizability of the source in the sky and measurement of the luminosity distance that inference of @xmath1 becomes possible .",
    "however , in those papers only a limited number of possible parameter values were considered .",
    "the event rates mentioned above are integrated over a large range of masses , and it is important to know how accurately lisa can measure @xmath1 depending on which binaries it observes during its lifetime ; indeed , the quality of parameter estimation varies widely depending on the properties of the sources @xcite . here",
    "we report on an exhaustive study of the relevant part of parameter space .",
    "we look at 15 mass pairs with ( observed ) component masses roughly in the range @xmath0 , at a fixed redshift . for each of these ,",
    "a monte - carlo simulation is performed with 5000 instances of sky position and orientation of the orbital plane .",
    "we then compute in what percentage of these cases one would be able to estimate sky position well enough that host identification should be possible . using only these instances , we calculate the distribution of the uncertainties in @xmath1 .",
    "our monte - carlo results are in such a form that they allow for easy rescaling to different redshifts @xmath11 ; we study what happens at @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "lisa s instrumental noise will not be the only restriction in the measurement of @xmath1 ; weak lensing will affect the determination of luminosity distance . to assess weak lensing effects ,",
    "our distance errors are combined in quadrature with a 4% additional error due to weak lensing @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : signal model ] we give a brief description of the signal model used in our study .",
    "our choice of systems is explained in section [ sec : systems ] and we study the impact of source localizability on parameter estimation in section [ sec : source_localizability ] . in section [ sec : cosmology ] we describe how we go about determining the dark energy parameter @xmath1 , including our criteria for localizability of the source . in section [ sec : results ] we discuss the results of our study , giving the fraction of systems for which the host galaxy can be localized , and the level at which @xmath1 can be estimated depending on what kind of system is observed .",
    "we will show that weak lensing - induced errors in @xmath10 will severely limit lisa s ability to measure @xmath1 .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] with the message that future studies should focus on correcting the effect of weak lensing .    throughout this paper we set @xmath28 unless stated otherwise .",
    "the coalescence of black hole binary systems is commonly divided into three successive epochs : inspiral , merger , and ringdown . during the inspiral ,",
    "the two black holes are well separated , and the radial inspiral timescale is much larger than the orbital timescale . as a consequence ,",
    "the gravitational wave signal emitted during this regime is well - understood analytically , in terms of the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation of general relativity .",
    "the latter is a perturbative approach whereby the amplitudes and phases of gravitational waveforms are expressed in terms of a characteristic velocity @xmath29 ( see @xcite and the extensive references therein ) .",
    "the dynamics of the binary system will be modeled very well in this way for many orbits , but eventually there comes a point where the pn approximation fails ; after that a numerical solution to the full einstein equations is called for .",
    "this happens when the _ innermost stable circular orbit _",
    "( isco ) is reached , after which the black holes plunge towards each other to form a single black hole ; this is referred to as the merger phase of the coalescence .",
    "the resulting black hole then undergoes  ringdown \" as it gradually settles down to a quiescent kerr black hole .",
    "although most of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is accumulated during the final stages of inspiral and merger , disentangling the parameters that characterize the system and extracting physical information relies critically on longer observation times , so that it is important to carefully study the inspiral phase . in this work",
    "we focus on lisa parameter estimation from observations of just the inspiral process . by doing",
    "so we can make use of analytical expressions for the detector response and its derivatives with respect to the different parameters which are needed to perform parameter estimation .",
    "this allows us to implement fast algorithms and explore the parameter space in a comprehensive way , unlike in numerical simulations where one can only consider a single choice of parameters ( masses , spins , @xmath30 ) at a time .",
    "in this way we are able to carry out an extensive study of lisa s performance , in particular in measuring the dark energy equation of state . nevertheless , by not including the merger and ringdown we are missing a fraction of the total snr that lisa would observe ( especially for the higher mass systems ) , which would improve parameter estimation .",
    "while there has been recent work on parameter estimation with lisa using numerical waveforms that include merger and ringdown @xcite , some more understanding may be needed before embarking on extensive studies ( but see the semi - analytic approach of @xcite ) .",
    "as far as inspiral itself is concerned , stavridis et al .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of spin - induced precession of the orbital plane on our ability to measure @xmath1 , though without inclusion of higher signal harmonics in the waveform .",
    "the work presented here is complementary , in that it assumes zero spins but does include higher harmonics in the analysis .",
    "the inspiral pn waveforms in the two polarizations @xmath31 and @xmath32 take the general form    @xmath33    here @xmath34^{2/3}$ ] is the post - newtonian expansion parameter , with @xmath35 the instantaneous orbital frequency ; @xmath36 is referred to as @xmath37th pn order . for observed component masses",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are , respectively , the observed total mass and the symmetric mass ratio , and @xmath10 is the luminosity distance to the source .",
    "the explicit expressions for @xmath42 up to 3pn can be found in @xcite .",
    "we neglect the contribution of spins , so that the gravitational waveform can be parametrized by @xmath43 parameters : luminosity distance , @xmath10 ; two angles @xmath44 defining the source position ; another two angles @xmath45 specifying the orientation of the orbital angular momentum ; two mass parameters ; the phase at coalescence , @xmath19 ; and the time of coalescence , @xmath18 .",
    "the sky position and orientation angles are defined with respect to a solar system barycentric frame , as in @xcite .    for lisa observation of supermassive black hole binary inspirals , most of the snr accumulates at frequencies below @xmath46 , in which case it is appropriate to use the low - frequency approximation to the lisa response function @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the detector can be regarded as two independent michelson interferometers , and the measured strain in each of these separately can be written as @xmath47 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath48 labels the two independent interferometers .",
    "the response functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 depend on time through the sky position and orientation of the source with respect to lisa , which vary over the observation time because of lisa s orbital motion .",
    "the factor @xmath51 is due to the @xmath52 angle between the interferometers arms .",
    "it is convenient to express the waveform in the fourier domain using the stationary phase approximation @xcite .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath53 of the response of detector @xmath54 then takes the form @xcite :    @xmath55 , \\label { ft}\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 , an overdot denotes the derivative with respect to time , and @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 the waveform is a superposition of harmonics of the orbital frequency ( labeled by the index @xmath59 ) , and each harmonic has pn contributions to the amplitude ( labeled by @xmath60 ; note that currently one can only go up to @xmath61 , as no amplitude corrections are explicitly known beyond 3pn @xcite ) .",
    "as the pn order in amplitude is increased , more and more harmonics appear ; at 3pn order there are eight , which is why the index @xmath59 only runs up to @xmath62 .",
    "quantities in eqs .",
    "( [ ft ] ) and ( [ phase ] ) with the argument @xmath63 denote their values at the time when the instantaneous orbital frequency @xmath35 sweeps past the value @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 are the polarization amplitudes and phases of the @xmath59th harmonic appearing at @xmath67th pn order .",
    "@xmath68 is the orbital phase of the binary and @xmath69 is a time - dependent term representing doppler modulation due to lisa s motion around the sun .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be found in @xcite ; time dependence of these quantities arises through the beam pattern functions due to the varying sky position and orientation of the source relative to the detector @xcite .",
    "the expression for @xmath69 is given in @xcite .",
    "for the pn expansions for @xmath72 , @xmath68 , @xmath35 , and @xmath73 we refer to @xcite .",
    "each harmonic in @xmath74 is taken to be zero outside a certain frequency range .",
    "the upper cut - off frequencies are dictated by the isco , beyond which the pn approximation breaks down .",
    "for simplicity we assume that this occurs when the orbital frequency @xmath35 reaches @xmath75 , the orbital frequency at isco of a test particle in schwarzschild geometry compared to what one often finds in other literature . ] : @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , in the frequency domain , the contribution to @xmath53 from the @xmath59th harmonic is set to zero for frequencies above @xmath77 .",
    "thus , the @xmath59th harmonic ends at a frequency @xmath78 in determining the lower cut - off frequencies we assume that the source is observed for at most one year , and the @xmath59th harmonic is truncated below a frequency @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the value of the orbital frequency one year before isco is reached @xcite : @xmath81 for simplicity , @xmath80 was computed using the quadrupole formula . in the above , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are , respectively , the time and orbital velocity at the last stable orbit , and @xmath84 yr .",
    "however , lisa s sensitivity becomes poorer and poorer as one goes to lower frequencies , and current estimates normally assume a  noise wall \" at a frequency no lower than @xmath85 hz .",
    "thus , we take the lower cut - off frequency of the @xmath59th harmonic to be the maximum of @xmath86 and @xmath79 .    as has been shown by several groups , both for earth - based detectors @xcite and for lisa @xcite , taking into account all the harmonics",
    "significantly improves the parameter estimation , and at the same time it extends the mass reach to higher mass systems .",
    "however , in our computer code we have restricted ourselves to 2pn order in both amplitude and phase .",
    "we emphasize that there is no technical difficulty in going to higher orders , but as shown in @xcite , the main improvement in parameter estimation occurs in going from 0pn to 0.5pn order in amplitude , and 2pn order will be more than sufficient for our purposes .    due to the large snr values that will be measured by lisa in observing smbbh events , the fisher information matrix formalism can be used to perform the parameter estimation . in the limit of high snr , the probability density distribution of the true parameters near the measured value can be approximated by a multivariate gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix is given by the inverse of the fisher information matrix @xcite .",
    "for each of the interferometers @xmath87 , the fisher matrix takes the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 , with @xmath90 the parameters to be estimated .",
    "specifically , we take these to be @xmath91 the fisher matrix for lisa as a whole is then @xmath92 the covariance matrix is @xmath93 , which gives the covariances between parameters , @xmath94 and hence also the 1-@xmath95 uncertainties , @xmath96^{1/2 } =   \\sqrt{\\sigma^{\\alpha\\alpha}},\\ ] ] where no summation over repeated indices is assumed .",
    "as mentioned above , we use the stationary phase approximation to the gravitational waveform in the frequency domain , which provides a way of getting analytical expressions for the observed signals , @xmath53 , and for their derivatives with respect to the parameters , @xmath97 @xcite . only the final integral over @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.gamma_ij ] ) needs to be done numerically .",
    "the code we use to generate our results has been validated by the lisa parameter estimation ( lisa pe ) taskforce @xcite through cross - checking of the output with different codes from other groups @xcite .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq.gamma_ij ] ) , @xmath99 is the one - sided noise power spectral density , which is a combination of instrumental and galactic confusion noise .",
    "we take our noise curve to be the one that was used by all the members of the lisa pe taskforce in @xcite , which also corresponds to the noise curve from the second round of the mock lisa data challenges @xcite .",
    "the sky - averaged instrumental noise is defined by s _",
    "( f ) & = & s_p . + & & + . , where @xmath98 is in hz , @xmath100 is the armlength , @xmath101 is the ( white ) position noise level , @xmath102 is the white acceleration noise level and @xmath103 is the lisa arm transfer frequency ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further comments and details ) .",
    "the galactic confusion noise is estimated by simulating the population synthesis of galactic binaries with periods shorter than @xmath104 s @xcite .",
    "the confusion noise at the output can be fitted as @xcite @xmath105 the total noise curve is the sum of instrumental and confusion noise , @xmath106 finally , as in @xcite , we also apply a lower frequency cut - off at @xmath107 hz .",
    "lisa s sensitivity band stretches from @xmath107 hz to @xmath108 hz , which means ( see eq .  ( [ eq : fisco ] ) ) that lisa will be able to see the coalescence of smbbh systems of ( observed ) total mass from @xmath109 to @xmath110 with signal - to - noise ratios of several hundreds to thousands ( see fig .  [ fig.snr_vs_masses ] ) almost anywhere in the observable universe .",
    "signals from higher mass systems will not significantly enter the frequency band , and systems with a total mass lower than @xmath109 will have signal amplitudes in lisa s band that quickly become too low to be observable .",
    "how many smbbh events is lisa expected to see in a year , and of what kind ?",
    "there are several possible smbbh formation scenarios that are able to reproduce the measured optical luminosity function of active galactic nuclei in the redshift range @xmath111 , but they differ in ( i ) the formation mechanism and masses of the  seed \" black holes , as well as in ( ii ) the details of how accretion causes black holes to grow in time . for instance , volonteri _ et al . _",
    "@xcite consider a scenario where light  seed \" black holes ( of a few hundred @xmath112 ) were produced as remnants of metal - free stars at @xmath113 . alternatively",
    ", gravitational instability of massive proto - galactic disks at @xmath114 could have led to the formation of much heavier seeds with masses @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "regardless of seed masses , the seeds may have grown by an accretion process in which infalling matter has a constant angular momentum direction , spinning up the black holes @xcite , or by chaotic accretion from a fragmented disc , causing much smaller spins @xcite .",
    "the implications for lisa of these various scenarios were recently assessed by the lisa pe taskforce @xcite .",
    "generally , scenarios with heavy seeds lead to several tens of mergers per year in lisa s past light cone , all of which will be detectable .",
    "if the seeds were smaller then the rate in the past light cone will be a factor of several larger , but lisa s sensitivity to light black hole coalescences is smaller ; here too the number of _ observed _ mergers is a few tens per year .",
    "whatever scenario , in the course of its lifetime lisa may see a few merger events that are close enough ( @xmath115 ) to be useful as standard sirens , but their expected masses differ depending on the scenario .    for this reason , in this work we did not focus attention on any particular part of the mass range and considered a uniform sampling of systems within lisa s mass reach . in particular ,",
    "we have analyzed @xmath116 different pairs of masses forming an almost uniform grid in the @xmath117 plane that covers most .",
    "] of the region of systems observable by lisa , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.snr_vs_masses ] : we consider all possible combinations of observed component masses @xmath118 .",
    "as pointed out by a number of authors , e.g. @xcite , the observed snrs and parameter estimation depend sensitively on the sky location and orientation of the source , so that monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations are called for if one wants to draw general conclusions about lisa s performance .",
    "thus , in this work for each of our @xmath116 pairs of masses , we have carried out @xmath119 mcs over @xmath120 drawn from a uniform distribution , computing in every case snrs and parameter errors .",
    "the luminosity distance , @xmath10 , and redshift , @xmath11 are extrinsic parameters in the problem .",
    "since snr , parameter uncertainties , and masses scale with these in simple ways , one can obtain a variety of results from calculations that were done with _",
    "fixed _ values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . and @xmath10 .",
    "]    let us discuss the dependence of the results ( snrs and parameter errors ) on the luminosity distance and redshift .",
    "first note that :    1 .   from conservation of energy , the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal is inversely proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "the frequency is redshifted because of the expansion of the universe , which causes a blue shift in the observed masses relative to the physical ones : @xmath121 , where @xmath122 stands for any intrinsic parameter with dimensions of mass .    since the snr and the fisher information matrix are proportional to the signal amplitude and its square , respectively , we have @xmath123 where @xmath124 is any parameter different from @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the quantities @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 are independent of @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , the redshift experienced by any signal due to the expansion of the universe translates into a shift in the physical masses .",
    "thus , a single simulation made for some pair of observed masses , say @xmath128 will be representative of an infinite set of systems at different redshifts , @xmath11 , with physical masses @xmath129 in fig .",

    ", we will assume that the host galaxy can be identified ( which may be possible with large survey instruments through electromagnetic counterparts @xcite ) and therefore we neglect the contribution from the size of the cluster ; but in any case , the main conclusions of this article would be the same .",
    "an important problem in determining distances ( also in conventional astronomy ) is that of weak lensing . as the waveform propagates through the matter distribution between the source and observer , its amplitude will suffer an overall amplification or deamplification , leading to an additional random error in the estimation of @xmath10 . for the range of distances considered here",
    ", this error will be at the level of 3 - 5% @xcite .",
    "this is substantive : at a distance of 3 gpc ( or @xmath141 ) , a distance error of 4% will correspond to an uncertainty in @xmath1 of 23% .",
    "however , it may be possible to largely remove the effect of weak lensing by mapping the mass distribution along the line of sight ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the next section",
    "we will see that , if left uncorrected , weak lensing will completely dominate over uncertainties due to lisa s instrumental noise in the determination of @xmath1 .",

    "indeed , a 4% error in @xmath10 translates into an 18.5% to 23% error in @xmath1 depending on redshift , and it is around these high values that the results for @xmath154 are sharply peaked when weak lensing is taken into account .",
    "this shows that , to make full use of lisa s potential , future studies should focus on correcting the weak lensing effect .",
    "lisa has the ability to approximately localize supermassive black hole binary coalescence events through modulation of the observed signal due to lisa s motion around the sun .",
    "electromagnetic follow - up observations could localize the source with negligible errors in the source s position in the sky and the redshift @xmath11 of the host galaxy . from the gravitational waveform",
    ", the luminosity distance @xmath10 can be inferred .",
    "the relationship between @xmath10 and @xmath11 depends sensitively on the past evolution of the universe , which affects the gravitational wave signal as it travels from the source to the detector over cosmological distances . assuming that at sufficiently large scales the universe is approximated well by a spatially flat flrw model and that the hubble constant , the density of matter and the density of dark energy are sufficiently well known , the observation of a single smbbh event in lisa can be used to measure the equation - of - state parameter of dark energy @xmath1 .",
    "thus , such events can be used as standard sirens , similar to the standard candles of conventional cosmography , but with no need for calibration of distance though a cosmic distance ladder of different kinds of sources .",
    "in @xcite , it was pointed out that inclusion of higher signal harmonics has a dramatic effect on source localization , making it more likely that we will be able to find the host galaxy for relatively close - by ( @xmath158 ) smbbh coalescences ; these are the ones needed for a good estimation of @xmath1 . however , in those papers a relatively small number of systems were studied .",
    "here we performed large - scale monte carlo simulations in order to exhaustively probe the relevant part of the parameter space .",
    "we considered 15 choices of observed component mass pairs , each being given 5000 possible sky positions and orientations , and the results were scaled to three different redshifts .    for each of the mass and redshift choices",
    ", we first computed how many systems would be localizable by the criterion that within a generous redshift interval there should at most be 3 possible host galaxies or galaxy clusters in the sky error ellipse .",
    "the fraction of localizable systems varies widely with total mass and mass ratio ( light and asymmetric systems being better ) , but at our  intermediate \" redshift of @xmath143 these were between 11.7% and 62.5% .",
    "we note that these numbers are likely to be on the conservative side .",
    "if a coalescence event is accompanied by a sufficiently obvious electromagnetic counterpart then our localizability criterion may be too strict .",
    "furthermore , a more careful treatment of the coalescence process ( inclusion of spins as well as merger and ringdown ) would increase these percentages , as discussed below .",
    "next we calculated uncertainties on @xmath1 for those systems which passed our localizability requirement so that a redshift value would be available . here too there is considerable dependence on the mass parameters ; at @xmath143 the median errors came out to be between 0.4% and 5.5% .",
    "the waveform model used here included higher signal harmonics ; indeed , without these it becomes difficult to even approximately localize the source in the first place @xcite .",
    "however , spins were ignored , which are also known to improve parameter estimation @xcite .",
    "recently stavridis et al .  have investigated how well @xmath1 could be measured with the inclusion of spin - induced precession of the orbital plane , though without higher harmonics @xcite ; they found 1-@xmath95 uncertainties @xmath132 that are similar to the ones in the present work .",
    "although higher harmonics and spins break the same degeneracies , no doubt some further improvements can be expected by combining the two .",
    "we also reiterate that , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we only looked at the inspiral signal .",
    "inspiral - only position estimates can be improved once again if the merger and ringdown signal is taken into account .",
    "babak et al .",
    "@xcite and thorpe et al .",
    "@xcite made a start with this using waveforms from numerical relativity simulations , and an extensive study on localizability using semi - analytic ( non - spinning ) inspiral - merger - ringdown waveforms was performed by mcwilliams et al .",
    ". it would be interesting to see estimates for sky localizability and luminosity distance measurements with waveforms that have both higher harmonics and spins in the inspiral part , and which incorporate merger and ringdown as well .",
    "the results concerning localizability of the source which we presented here may well be underestimates by factors of several .",
    "as far as the luminosity distance is concerned , if we were only limited by lisa s instrumental noise and the confusion background due to galactic white dwarf binaries , then here too there would be , with no doubt , room for improvement .",
    "however , measurements of @xmath10 get  polluted \" by weak lensing effects , which in turn affects the uncertainties on @xmath1 .",
    "recent work indicates that these effects can be substantially reduced by exploiting the brightness of galaxies as a tracer of the gravitational fields of matter along the line of sight @xcite , or through mapping shear and flexion of galaxy images @xcite . with a deep and wide - field image of galaxies ,",
    "as might be available with , e.g. , extremely large telescope @xcite and euclid @xcite and with which one could construct a flexion map , one may be able to reduce the weak lensing error on @xmath10 to about 1.5% in the redshift range @xmath159 @xcite . at @xmath25",
    "this translates into an 8.5% uncertainty in @xmath1 , which is competitive with electromagnetic measurements . by utilizing still higher - order effects in the apparent deformation of galaxies",
    "it may be possible to reduce this number a little further .",
    "another idea would be to use high resolution cmb maps to estimate weak lensing effects ; it is not yet clear , however , how one might infer lensing effects at redshifts of @xmath160 from such maps .",
    "the clear message of the results we have presented is that in order to use the full potential of lisa as a tool for cosmography , further in - depth studies are urgently needed on ways to correct for weak lensing .",
    "we would like to thank bernard schutz for discussions at an early stage of this work , and peter coles and martin hendry for discussions on the mitigation of weak lensing effects .",
