    "the pairs are either from pseudo - scaler or vector - meson decays , typically after the collision on the time scale of the strong interaction , or from hard - scattering processes like open heavy - flavor production , drell - yan pair production or quark - gluon ( @xmath0 ) compton scattering , all occurring early in the collision .",
    "in addition to these sources quark matter produced in heavy ion collisions may emit thermal radiation , leave imprints from medium modifications of the meson properties , and modify the contribution from hard - scattering processes .",
    "isolating the medium effects from the expected sources is the experimental challenge and this challenge is two fold . first one needs to determine and subtract the pair background , which in central collisions is more than a factor of hundred larger than the signal .",
    "this subtraction is very involved and dominates the systematic uncertainties .",
    "after many years of analysis effort this subtraction is well under control ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the second challenge is to accurately determine the expected sources shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : dilepton - cartoon ] .",
    "phenix was able to determine these expected sources from data on meson production cross sections ( see fig .  [",

    "this was done for the vector mesons @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath2 @xcite as well as for heavy - flavor production @xcite and @xmath0 compton scattering .",
    "the later contribution can be isolated in the kinematic region where the mass is smaller than the transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "the ratio of direct - to - inclusive virtual photons can then be extrapolated to mass equal zero and compared to perturbative qcd calculations @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp - rgamma ] the agreement is very good .",
    "with our understanding of the expected sources we have a solid base line to search for effects off the medium . already from a first glance at the mass distribution from collisions ( fig .",

    "the centrality dependence of the integrated yield is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : auau - centrality ] for two mass ranges @xmath4 2 and 150 to 750 2 , respectively .",
    "the yield in the lower mass bin is dominated by pairs from @xmath5 dalitz - decays and consequently follows the centrality dependence of the pion yield .",
    "however , the yield in the higher mass range , which includes the enhancement , deviates from the expected dependence and indicates that central collisions contribute most of the observed enhancement .",
    "the yield from @xmath6 or @xmath7 annihilation in the medium should also increase faster than the number of participants , but it is not clear if the data can be explained quantitatively .    splitting the data in bins of pair reveals that in the mass range from 150 to 750 2 the yield is enhanced at all , but not uniformly .",
    "the enhancement is largest at the lowest . to quantify this more",
    "phenix has measured the transverse mass ( ) distributions , corrected for pair acceptance , and determined local slopes as function of pair mass . the inverse local slope or for the two regions @xmath8 gev and @xmath9 gev is plotted in fig .",

    "not much can be said about the contribution from charm production .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig : auau - mass ] are consistent with the extrapolation of the cross - section using binary scaling , which is labeled @xmath10 ( pythia ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : auau - mass ] .",
    "however , data on charm production @xcite indicate a large degree of interaction of charm quarks with the medium in central collisions , which must also modify the angular correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . if the momentum direction of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks would randomized in the medium the data should be compared to the curve labeled @xmath10 ( random correlation ) , which leaves room for other contributions above 1 2 .",
    "interesting results emerge when looking at the kinematic region of @xmath13 , where direct virtual photon emission was observed in collisions .",
    "details of the analysis , in particular a discussion of the validity of extrapolating virtual photons back to the real photon point at mass equal zero , can be found in @xcite . the final result for the direct - to - inclusive virtual photon ratio , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : auau - rgamma ] , indicates a significant excess beyond the expectation from initial state @xmath0 compton scattering .",
    "[ fig : auau - directgamma ] shows the direct photon spectrum resulting from fig .",
    "[ fig : auau - rgamma ] . here",
    "the virtual photon data were extrapolate to the real photon point , which in this case means setting the direct - to - inclusive ratio for virtual photons equal to the one for real photons .",
    "the data are consistent with results obtained from calorimeter measurements at higher in the same experiment . while data follow the expectation from pqcd an excess is found in au@xmath14au .",
    "the inverse slope of the excess , after subtracting the scaled data are @xmath15 mev .",
    "this effective temperature can be interpreted as limit on the initial temperature of the reaction volume .",
    "work to confirm these results with data from real photons is underway and has produced consistent upper limits .",
    "much work has gone into modeling dilepton and photon production from the fireball created in heavy ion collisions at sps energies @xcite .",
    "after some 20 years of experimental and theoretical development the following picture has emerged .",
    "electromagnetic radiation is predominantly emitted from hadron - hadron collisions at times when the spectral function of mesons are significantly broadened compared to vacuum .",
    "the colliding hadrons participate in the collective expansion and consequently the dileptons show radial flow . while emission at the partonic level is also observed it does not contribute significantly to the over all yield @xcite .",
    "the same sources must also contribute to dilepton production at rhic energies . in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory - mass ] models , which describe sps data , are confronted with dilepton mass distribution @xcite .",
    "evidently , the predicted yield underestimates the data and these models are insufficient to describe rhic data .",
    "most likely the contributions from the partonic phase must be more significant than realized . at closer inspection",
    "it turns out that the model calculations shown in fig .",

    ", scaledwidth=57.0% ]    model calculations of thermal photon emission based on perturbative qcd show that @xmath0 compton scattering is very important @xcite . in a qgp",
    "the gluon densities might be so large that @xmath0 compton scattering outshines @xmath7-annihilation and the perturbative approach may be insufficient all together . in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory - gamma ] various models are compared with real photon data @xcite .",
    "all models agree roughly with the observed slope .",
    "the initial temperature in the models varies from 300 to 600 mev depending on the initial conditions , in particular the formation time . however , there are large differences in the predicted cross sections , which need to be addressed in future work .",
    "last i return to dilepton spectra , but in a double differential representation in mass and . in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory - mt ] the same calculations already shown in the mass projection ( fig .",
    "[ fig : theory - mass ] ) are compared to the spectra . in the mass range from 500 to 750 2",
    "the models describe the data except for the lowest , as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : theory - mass ] . at lower masses",
    "the models fall short at all .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the data above @xmath161 2 were used to determine the direct photon yield . if @xmath0 compton scattering would be consistently included in the models it would fill some of the difference at lower , though probably at the lowest it would not account for all data .",
    "another important consequence may be that the models then would likely overestimate the yield in mass range 500 to 700 2 .",
    "obviously more complete theoretical calculations are required . in the highest shown mass range",
    "the models predict widely different yields , most likely due to different contributions from hard scattering processes .",
    "again this needs to be looked into .    to conclude this section i want to underline the importance of consistent model calculations that not only have a realistic description of the space time evolution and hadron spectra , but that also describe dilepton and photon emission simultaneously .",
    "comparison of data to various models that successfully describe data from lower energies .",
    "the labeling scheme is identical to fig .",
    "dilepton data analysis of the phenix experiment has matured significantly over the past years .",
    "experimental issues , most importantly the subtraction of pair background , are under control .",
    "data from collisions establish a precise reference to detect medium effects in collisions .",
    "phenix has discovered such effects , namely a significant enhancement of dilepton production in mostly central collisions .",
    "the enhancement covers the mass range from roughly 100 mev to 750 mev and is focused at low .",
    "most strikingly it exhibits a prominent soft contribution with @xmath16120 mev , which is independent of mass over the accessible range .",
    "phenix has also presented a first measurement of thermal photons indicating an initial temperature larger than 220 mev .    though much work on theoretical models is needed to make final conclusions some firm conclusions can already be made .",
    "thermal radiation from the hadronic phase , mostly from @xmath6-annihilation with collision broadening has emerged as the main contribution to dilepton enhancement observed at the sps @xcite .",
    "these contributions that obviously must exist also at rhic energies remain insufficient to explain the phenix data .",
    "more complete calculations of dilepton radiation from the partonic phase need to be made .",
    "model calculations of thermal real photon production is consistent with the data and hint towards initial temperatures larger than 300 mev .",
