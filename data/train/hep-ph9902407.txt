    "recently , dienes , dudas and gherghetta ( ddg ) @xcite have suggested the intriguing possibility that grand unification may occur at intermediate or even low energy scales in models with extra spacetime dimensions compactified on orbifolds of radii @xmath0 . above the compactification scale @xmath1 ,",
    "the vacuum polarization tensors for the gauge fields of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) receive finite corrections from a tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations which contribute at one loop . as a consequence ,",
    "the gauge couplings develop a power - law rather than logarithmic dependence on the ultraviolet cut off of the theory , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "while this is not running in the conventional sense , the gauge couplings nonetheless evolve rapidly as a function of @xmath2 , so that it is possible to achieve an accelerated unification .    in the minimal scenario proposed by ddg , all the non - chiral mssm fields , the two higgs doublets and the gauge multiplets ,",
    "live in a @xmath3 dimensional spacetime , and have an associated tower of kk excitations .",
    "the chiral mssm fields are assumed to lie at fixed points of the orbifolds , and thus have no kk towers .",
    "this is the simplest way of avoiding the difficulties associated with giving mass to chiral kk states .",
    "ddg demonstrated that an approximate gauge unification could be achieved in this scenario , at a grand unification scale @xmath4 that is much smaller than its usual value in supersymmetric theories , @xmath5  gev .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , strict comparison to the low energy data reveals that for tev - scale compactifications , the ddg model predicts a value for @xmath6 that is higher than the prediction in conventional unified theories , which is already @xmath75 standard deviations higher than the experimental value in conventional supersymmetric unified theories , compared to the world average , @xmath8 @xcite . ] . assuming that the unification point coincides with the string scale , then a specific model of string scale threshold corrections is required before one can claim that unification in the ddg model",
    "is actually achieved .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to point out that there are a number of simple variations on the ddg proposal that achieve gauge unification much more precisely than the minimal scenario described above .",
    "to begin , however , let us consider the variations that are as successful as the minimal case . as pointed out by ddg ,",
    "one possibility is to allow @xmath9 generations of matter fields to experience extra dimensions , and to add to the theory their chiral conjugate mirror fields , so that suitable kk mass terms may be formed .",
    "assuming that the orbifold is @xmath10 , then one may take the mirror fields to be @xmath11 odd , so that unwanted zero modes are not present in the low - energy theory .",
    "given that the kk excitations of the matter fields form complete su(5 ) multiplets , it is perhaps not surprising that if unification is achieved for @xmath12 , it will also be preserved for @xmath13 , at least for some range of @xmath14 .    what is less obvious is that the kk excitations of the matter fields may be chosen to form _ incomplete _ su(5 )",
    "multiplets , and an approximate unification may still be preserved if only _",
    "some _ of the mssm gauge and higgs fields experience extra dimensions . in section  2",
    ", we will present three models that demonstrate ( i ) that it is not necessary for all gauge groups to live in the higher dimensional bulk in order to achieve unification , and ( ii ) a precise unification may sometimes be obtained without introducing any exotic matter , beyond the mirror fields described above . in section  3",
    "we study these cases quantitatively , taking into account weak - scale threshold corrections , and two - loop running up to the compactification scale .",
    "for tev scale compactifications @xcite , we will see that all of the nonminimal scenarios we present in this paper unify more precisely than the minimal ddg scenario , and do not require large threshold corrections at the unification scale .",
    "in section  4 we summarize our conclusions , and make some brief comments on the phenomenological implications of these models when the compactification scale is low .",
    "we assume @xmath3 spacetime dimensions , with @xmath15 dimensions each compactified on a @xmath11 orbifold of radius @xmath16 .",
    "the fields that experience extra dimensions are periodic in the @xmath15 new spacetime coordinates @xmath17 , and are either even or odd under @xmath18 .",
    "for example , in the case where @xmath19 , these ` bulk ' fields have expansions of the form @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 indicates the kk mode .",
    "the only other fields in the theory are those which live at the orbifold fixed points @xmath23 or @xmath24 , and have no kk excitations .",
    "the effect of a tower of kk states on the running of the mssm gauge couplings was computed by ddg , and is given in a useful approximate form by @xcite @xmath25 \\,\\,\\ , .",

    "ddg observe that a sufficient condition for gauge unification to be preserved is that the ratios @xmath30 be independent of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "the kk beta function contributions are given by @xmath46 this scenario achieves unification much more precisely than the minimal one . in the case where @xmath39  tev and @xmath19 , the predicted value of @xmath6 is only 1.8 standard deviations _ below _ the experimental central value , ignoring all threshold corrections . allowing the superparticle spectrum to vary as in table  4 , we find this prediction varies between @xmath47 thus",
    ", unification can be achieved in this model without any string scale threshold corrections .",
    "@xmath38 scenario 3 : in this example , the su(3 ) gauge multiplet is confined to the orbifold fixed point , and hence we are only allowed to place leptons and higgs fields in the bulk . if we let @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent the number of right - handed and left - handed kk lepton excitations ( including their chiral conjugate partners ) , then the constraint @xmath50 implies that @xmath51 , which has no solution for only three generations of left - handed lepton fields .",
    "however , there is a simple way to circumvent this problem .",
    "notice that if we add su(5 ) * 5*+@xmath52 pairs in which only the lepton compontents live in the bulk , then the condition on @xmath48 and @xmath49 given above will hold , since differences in zero mode beta function pairs will remain unchanged . a solution may then be obtained by choosing @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which implies the existence of two such * 5*+@xmath52 pairs , when one generation of right - handed and three generations of left - handed mssm lepton fields are assigned to the bulk .",
    "the beta functions for this scenario are then given by @xmath55 notice in this case that the su(3 ) gauge coupling only evolves logarithmically , since @xmath56 .",
    "unification may be achieved at a low scale by virtue of the power - law evolution of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , as can be seen from fig .  1 .",
    "this scenario is about as successful as scenario  2 , predicting @xmath6 only @xmath59 standard deviations below the experimental central value , ignoring all threshold corrections , and assuming that the exotic matter fields have masses of @xmath43 . allowing the sparticle mass spectrum to vary between @xmath43 and 1  tev , as in table  4",
    ", we find that the scenario  3 prediction for @xmath6 varies between @xmath60 for @xmath19 and @xmath39  tev .",
    "again , unification is achieved without the need for threshold corrections at the high scale .",
    "although this scenario does indeed involve some new matter fields , the choice is relatively minimal , and may be completely natural from the point of view of string theory .",
    "what is interesting about the scenarios we ve presented is that gauge unification can be achieved in so many different ways .",
    "each of our scenarios unifies more precisely than the minimal ddg model , and none requires large ( or in two cases any ) threshold corrections at the unification scale .",
    "these models illustrate two other interesting points as well : ( 1 ) one can achieve unification when some of the standard model gauge groups are confined to a brane .",
    "( 2 ) there are some models that unify more precisely than ddg that _ do not _ require any additional matter fields with exotic quantum numbers , beyond the vector - like kk towers of certain mssm fields that are chosen to live in the bulk . before concluding , we comment briefly on some of the other phenomenological implications of these scenarios when the compactification scale is low .",
    "for a more complete discussion of the phenomenology of standard model kk excitations in models with tev scale compactification  @xcite , we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite .    in scenarios  1 and",
    "2 the gluon has a tower of kk excitations , which leads to a significant bound on the compactification scale .",
    "the kk gluon excitations are massive color octet vector mesons , with couplings both to zero mode gluons and to all the quarks .",
    "thus , the kk gluons are in every way identical to flavor universal colorons , and are subject to the same bounds . recall that in coloron models , one obtains a massive color octet from the spontaneous breaking of su(3)@xmath61su(3 ) down to the diagonal color su(3 ) . in the case where the two su(3 ) gauge couplings are equal , the coloron couples to quarks exactly like a gluon , or a kk gluon .",
    "the couplings of colorons or kk gluons to zero mode gluons are completely determined by su(3 ) gauge invariance , and hence are also the same .",
    "thus the relevant bound on the lowest kk gluon excitation is given by @xmath62  gev at the 95% confidence level @xcite , which follows from consideration of the dijet spectrum at the tevatron .",
    "this constraint places a lower bound on the scale for all the kk excitations in scenarios  1 and  2 .",
    "we can obtain a similar bound on the compactification scale in scenario  3 from the production and hadronic decay of @xmath63 boson kk excitations , which have standard model couplings to the quarks : @xmath64  gev @xcite .",
    "other direct collider bounds on the compactification scale require a more detailed analysis , given the nonstandard @xmath65 and @xmath66 couplings in our models .",
    "this issue will be considered elsewhere @xcite .",
    "scenario  1 is particularly interesting when one takes into account that interaction vertices involving fields that all live in the higher dimensional bulk respect a conservation of kk number .",
    "( one can think of this as arising from the conservation of kk momentum following from translational invariance in the extra dimensions . ) hence , in scenario  1 , the kk excitations of the electroweak gauge fields can not couple to the lepton zero modes , and we obtain both @xmath66 and @xmath65 bosons with otherwise standard couplings , that are naturally leptophobic !",
    "these states would likely be within the reach of the lhc for tev scale compactifications .",
    "the other two scenarios present a more complicated phenomenology , since some generations of a given mssm matter field live in the bulk while others live on the brane .",
    "it follows that the kk excitations of a standard model gauge field would have generation - dependent couplings to the zero mode matter fields , and may contribute to a variety of quark and lepton flavor - changing processes .",
    "finally it is worth pointing out that in scenario  3 , the fact that the kk @xmath63 boson excitations ca nt couple to zero mode left - handed lepton fields , also leads to a leptophobic @xmath65 .",
    "while the purpose of the present work was to focus on gauge unification in these nonminimal scenarios , a more quantitative discussion of the tev scale phenomenology of the scenarios described here will be presented in a separate publication  @xcite .",
