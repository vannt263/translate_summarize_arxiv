    "over the last decade network analysis has proven to be an invaluable tool to advance our understanding of complex dynamical systems in diverse scientific fields@xcite including the neuroscienes@xcite .",
    "specific aspects of functional brain networks  with nodes that are usually associated with sensors capturing the dynamics of different brain regions and with links representing interactions@xcite between pairs of brain regions  were reported to differ between epilepsy patients and healthy controls@xcite which supports the concept of an epileptic network@xcite . moreover , epileptic networks during generalized and focal seizures ( including status epilepticus ) were shown to possess topologies that differ from those during the seizure - free interval@xcite .",
    "most of the aforementioned studies investigated network - specific characteristics such as the average shortest path length or the clustering coefficient .",
    "network theory , however , also provides concepts and tools to assess various aspects of importance ( e.g. centralities ) of a node in a network@xcite , but by now , there are only a few studies that investigated node - specific characteristics of epileptic networks@xcite , and these studies investigated the dynamics of functional brain networks during seizures only . refs . and",
    "reported on highest centrality values for the ( clinically defined ) epileptic focus which would support the notion of a crucial network node that facilitates seizure activity .",
    "we here report preliminary findings obtained from a time - resolved analysis of node importance in functional brain networks derived from long - term , multi - channel , intracranial electroencephalographic ( ieeg ) recordings from an epilepsy patient . investigating various centrality aspects ,",
    "we provide first evidence that the epileptic focus is not consistently the most important node ( i.e. , with highest centrality ) , but node importance may drastically vary over time .",
    "we analyzed ieeg data from a patient who underwent presurgical evaluation of drug - resistant epilepsy of left mesial - temporal origin and who is completely seizure free after selective amygdalohippocampectomy .",
    "the patient had signed informed consent that the clinical data might be used and published for research purposes .",
    "the study protocol had previously been approved by the local ethics committee .",
    "ieeg was recorded from @xmath0 channels ( chronically implanted intrahippocampal depth and subdural grid and strip electrodes ) and the total recording time amounted to about 1.7 days , during which three seizures were observed .",
    "ieeg data were sampled at using a analog - to - digital converter , filtered within a frequency band of , and referenced against the average of two recording contacts outside the focal region .",
    "following previous studies@xcite we associated each recording site with a network node and defined functional network links between any pair of nodes @xmath1 and @xmath2regardless of their anatomical connectivity  using the mean phase coherence @xmath3 as a measure for signal interdependencies@xcite .",
    "we used a sliding window approach with non - overlapping windows of @xmath4 data points ( duration : ) each to estimate @xmath3 in a time - resolved fashion , employing the hilbert transform to extract the phases @xmath5 from the windowed ieeg .",
    "the elements of the interdependence matrix * i*then read :    @xmath6    in order to derive an adjacency matrix * a*from * i*(i.e , an undirected , weighted functional network ) and to account for the case that the centrality metrics could reflect trivial properties of the weight collection@xcite we sort @xmath7 in ascending order and denote with @xmath8 the position of @xmath9 in this order ( rank ) .",
    "we then consider @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "this approach leads to a weight collection with entries being uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the importance of a network node may be assessed via centrality metrics@xcite .",
    "degree , closeness , and betweenness centrality are frequently used for network analyses , and for these metrics generalizations to weighted networks have been proposed ( see ref . for an overview ) .",
    "if a node is adjacent to many other nodes , it possesses a high degree centrality . when investigating weighted networks , however , the number of neighboring nodes is not a sensible measure and one may consider _ strength centrality _ of node @xmath1 instead@xcite    @xmath14    assessing node importance in weighted networks via closeness and betweenness centrality requires the definition of shortest paths .",
    "this can be achieved by assuming the `` length '' of a link to vary inversely with its weight@xcite .",
    "the _ closeness centrality _ of node @xmath1 is defined as    @xmath15    where @xmath16 denotes the length of the shortest path from node @xmath1 to node @xmath2 .",
    "the _ betweenness centrality _ of node @xmath1 is the fraction of shortest paths running through that node . @xmath17    here",
    ", @xmath18 denotes the number of shortest paths between nodes @xmath19 and @xmath2 running through node @xmath1 , and @xmath20 is the total number of shortest paths between nodes @xmath19 and @xmath2 .",
    "we used the algorithm proposed by brandes@xcite to estimate the aforementioned centralities .",
    "[ img : centr ] illustrates the centrality metrics @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23for the nodes of an exemplary network .",
    "in figs . [ img : dc_example ] , [ img : cc_example ] , and [ img : bc_example ] we show the temporal evolutions of @xmath21 , @xmath22and @xmath23over for three selected nodes from the exemplary epileptic brain networks investigated here .",
    "we chose one node from within the epileptic focus ( upper plots of figures ) , another node from the immediate surrounding of the epileptic focus ( middle plots of figures ) , and a third one which was associated with a recording site far off the epileptic focus ( lower plots in figures ) .",
    "all centrality metrics exhibited large fluctuations over time , both on shorter and longer time scales .",
    "the temporal evolutions of @xmath21and @xmath22were quite similar , while @xmath23behaved differently from the two other metrics .",
    "the similarity between @xmath21and @xmath22was to be expected , at least to some degree ( see the discussion in ref . ) , since they characterize the role of a node as a starting or end point of a path . on the other hand , @xmath23characterizes a node s share of all paths between pairs of nodes that utilize that node .    for this patient",
    ", we could not observe any clear cut changes of the centrality metrics prior to seizures that would indicate a preictal state .",
    "moreover , none of the metrics exhibited features in their temporal evolutions that would constantly indicate the network nodes associated with the epileptic focus ( or its immediate neighborhood ) as important nodes .",
    "rather , their importance may drastically vary over time .    to demonstrate that our exemplary results hold for all nodes of the epileptic brain networks investigated here",
    ", we show , in fig .",
    "[ img : boxplots ] , findings obtained from an exploratory data analysis .",
    "the main statistical characteristics of centralities of each node ( maximum and minimum value , the median , and the quartiles estimated from the respective temporal evolutions ) indicated that neither the epileptic focus nor its immediate surrounding can be considered as important , and that the different centrality metrics ranked different nodes as most important .",
    "we have investigated various aspects of centrality of individual nodes in epileptic brain networks derived from long - term , multi - channel ieeg recordings from an epilepsy patient . utilizing different centrality metrics , we observed nodes far from the clinically defined epileptic focus and its immediate surrounding to be the most important ones .",
    "although our findings must , at present , be regarded as preliminary , they are nevertheless in stark contrast to previous studies@xcite that reported highest node centralities for the epileptic focus only .",
    "it remains to be investigated whether the different findings can be attributed to the dynamics of different epileptic brains or to , e.g. , differences in network inference .",
    "one also needs to take into account that there are a number of potentially confounding variables whose impact on estimates of different centrality metrics is still poorly understood .",
