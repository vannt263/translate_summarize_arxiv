    "we consider the grossone , @xmath5 formalism of yaroslav sergeyev @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for other discussions of this structure and its applications .",
    "this paper begins in the stance that there are no completed infinite sets .",
    "we shall show that the grossone is then naturally interpreted as a generic finite natural number and that the sergeyev natural number construction @xmath1 can be seen as a generic finite set . by a _",
    "finite set , i mean that @xmath6 represents the properties of an arbitrarily chosen finite set of integers taken from @xmath7 to a maximal integer represented by @xmath8 this means that for any given finite realization of @xmath9 , @xmath0 will be larger than all the other integers in that realization . in this sense",
    ", we can say that @xmath0 is larger than any particular integer .",
    "the grossone @xmath0 is a symbol representing the highest element in a generic finite set of natural numbers .",
    "infinity is not the issue here .",
    "the issue is clarity of construction and the possibility of calculation with either limited or unlimited means .",
    "the original intent for the grossone and the set @xmath1 was that @xmath6 should represent the infinity of the natural numbers in a way that makes the counting of infinity closer to computational issues than does the traditional cantorian approach . in sergeyev s",
    "original approach , @xmath6 is understood to be an infinite set , but one does not use the usual property of a cantorian infinite set that an infinite set is in @xmath10 correspondence with a proper subset of itself .",
    "rather , one regards special subsets such as the even integers as having their own measurement as parts of @xmath11 for example , in the original approach it is fixed that grossone @xmath0 is even , since it is postulated that the sets of even and odd numbers have the same number of elements , namely @xmath12 analogously , @xmath13 are integral for finite @xmath14 in our approach , which in this sense is a relaxation of the sergeyev original approach , we interpret the grossone as a _ generic _ natural number and so it can be interpreted to be either even or odd .",
    "we shall see , in section @xmath15 how this has specific computational consequences in the summation of series .",
    "both interpretations are useful .",
    "the generic integer intepretation that we use here has the advantage that the assumptions made are just those that can be applied to finite sets of natural numbers",
    ". this will become apparent as we continue with more theory and examples .",
    "the present paper is self - contained , and does not take on any axioms from the work of sergeyev .",
    "we use the notation @xmath0 as in the sergeyev grossone , so that our work can be compared with his . as we shall see , the result is that a different conceptual approach , via generic finite sets , has a very close relationship with the sergeyev theory of an arithmetic of the infinite !",
    "our theory can be seen as a relaxation of the sergeyev theory where we no longer assume that @xmath0 is divisible by arbitrary natural numbers . as explained in section 3",
    ", we adopt the    _ transfer principle : any statement @xmath16 using @xmath5 is true if there is a natural number @xmath17 such that @xmath18 is a true statement about finite natural numbers @xmath19 for all @xmath20 _    this is the criterion determining the truth of statements about @xmath5 creating a theory distinct from the sergeyev theory , but sharing many of its notations and conceptual moves .",
    "see section 3 for further discussion and , in particular , with a comparison with the axioms of @xcite .",
    "we reflect here many of these issues in the interpretation of @xmath6 as a generic finite set .",
    "our @xmath6 is not a set but rather a symbolic structure that stands for any finite set . as a symbolic structure @xmath6",
    "is inductively defined so that any of the following list of symbols denotes @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath1 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 for any finite natural number @xmath14 this means that there are infinitely many possible symbolic structures that indicate @xmath11 each structure is finite as a symbolic structure .",
    "depending upon the size of the set to which we shall refer , any and all of these symbols can be used for the reference .",
    "any given positive integer @xmath19 can occur , and does occur , in all such representatives past a certain point .",
    "consequently , we say that @xmath19 _ belongs _ to @xmath6 for all natural numbers @xmath14 and we say that @xmath0 _ can be greater than _ any given natural number @xmath14 in this form we create a language in which speaking about @xmath6 is very similar to speaking about an infinite set , but @xmath6 , being a symbol for a generic finite set , is not be interpreted as a cantorian infinite set .",
    "the issues about subsets and @xmath10 correspondences do not arise .",
    "the paper is organized into sections @xmath27 and @xmath28 devoted to this point of view about genericity .",
    "the style of writing for sections @xmath29 and @xmath28 is sometimes polemic , as it is written in the form of a speaker who is convinced that only finite sets should be allowed in mathematics .",
    "infinite sets are seen to be taken care of by the concept of generic finite set .",
    "we show how to apply the grossone formalism by first thinking about how a computation could be written finitely , and then how it may appear in the limit where the grossone @xmath0 is itself regarded as an infiinite number . except for certain situations where we can consider limits as @xmath0 becomes infinite",
    ", we do not use the original intepretations of the grossone as an infinite quantity .",
    "an example of a situation where one can shift from one interpretation to the other is in a summation of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a function defined on the natural numbers .",
    "for example , consider @xmath32 we can regard this as standing for all specific formulas of the type @xmath33 where @xmath17 is any natural number , _ or _ we can regard it as an generic summation with an generic result of @xmath34 the generic result can be regarded in as formally similar to the infinite result that comes from taking @xmath0 infinite .",
    "both ways of thinking about the answer tell us how the summation behaves when the number of summands is @xmath0 and @xmath0 very large .",
    "other examples will be discussed in the body of the paper .",
    "secion @xmath35 is written from another point of view . in this section",
    "we take a categorical and relative point of view about  being infinite . \"",
    "we accept that in bare set theory a set is infinite if it is in @xmath10 correspondence with a proper subset of itself .",
    "but in another category we ask that this @xmath10 correspondence be an injection in that category that is not a surjection .",
    "this means , for example , that a circle or a sphere in the topological category is not infinite ( hence finite by definition ) since there is no homeomorphism of a sphere to a proper subset of itself .",
    "we examine the model @xmath6 for the extended natural numbers from this point of view , and show that it can be construed as set theoretically infinite , but topologically finite .",
    "we hope that these two points of view for interpretation will enrich the intriguing subject of the grossone and it uses .",
    "in yaroslav sergeyev s theory of numeration , he considers a completion of the natural numbers @xmath36 to a set that contains an infinite number @xmath5 referred to as _",
    "grossone_. the completion is denoted by the notation @xmath6 in the form = \\ { 1,2 ,   1 - 2 , 1 - 1 , 1 } .",
    "the grossone , @xmath0 , behaves  just like \" a very large integer , so that @xmath6 as a set is conceived to have all of its properties analagous to those of a finite set of integers such as @xmath37 while segeyev does not quite explicitly say that @xmath6 and @xmath38 are logical twins just so long as @xmath17 is very very large , this is the basic idea that we explore in this paper .",
    "for example , it should not be the case that @xmath6 should appear infinite in the sense of having a @xmath10 correspondence with a proper subset of itself .",
    "some of the usual attempts obviously fail .",
    "for example if we try to map @xmath6 to itself by the map @xmath39 then @xmath40 and so we need a larger domain .",
    "this mirrors the problem for the finite set into the infinite set @xmath11    but what set is this @xmath6 ?",
    "how should we interpret its two appearances of the  three dots \" ?",
    "in the case of @xmath41 the three dots refer to the peano axioms for the ( usual ) natural numbers , assuring us that given a natural number @xmath19 then there is a successor to that number indicated by @xmath42 and that @xmath43 is never equal to @xmath14 the principle of mathematical induction is then used to characterize the set @xmath44 if @xmath45 is any subset of @xmath41 containing @xmath7 and having the property that @xmath46 implies that @xmath47 then @xmath48    at first glance one is inclined to guess that @xmath6 consists in two copies of @xmath49 one ascending @xmath50 and one descending @xmath51 if we then take the union @xmath52 is this @xmath53 i submit that this _ is not _ the desired @xmath11 for one thing , if one starts counting upward @xmath54 one never leaves the left half of this union . and if one starts counting down , one never leaves the right half of the union .",
    "this is not in analogy to the large finite set , where either counting down or counting up will cover all of the territory .",
    "also , there appears to be an injection of the union to itself that is not a surjection .",
    "just add one to every element of the left half and subtract one from every element of the right half .",
    "all in all , we must search for a different model for @xmath55 or a different category for it to call its home .",
    "i believe that the simplest interpretation for @xmath6 is that it is a _ generic finite set .",
    "_ this means that we interpret @xmath0 as a generic  large \" natural number .",
    "@xmath0 is not any specific natural number unless we want to take it as such .",
    "then since @xmath6 is a generically finite set , it has no @xmath10 correspondence with a proper subset of itself .",
    "in fact , @xmath6 is not a set at all .",
    "it is a symbolic construct that represents the _ form _ of a finite set .",
    "it is not a set just as an algebraic variable @xmath56 , standing for a number , is not a number . as such , @xmath6 has no members , nor does it have any subsets . as a symbolic construct however , @xmath6 has some nice features .",
    "we all agree on the equalities @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 for any _ specific _ natural number @xmath14 this is the nature of @xmath6 as a symbolic construct . in this sense",
    "it gives the appearance of acting like an infinite set .",
    "this property of the notations that we use is an inheritance from the set theory notation where exactly the same symbolic phenomenon seems to indicate infinity where one only has the form of a series of numbers and the peano property of knowing that for a given @xmath19 there is an @xmath62 in the usual notation for the set of natural numbers , we have @xmath63 for any specific natural number @xmath14 thus we can also regard @xmath41 as a generic symbol , but it is a generic symbol that is incomplete if it is to be viewed as representing a finite set .",
    "the symbolic construction for @xmath6 allows us to start anew and eliminate the notion of a completed infinity from our work .",
    "if we interpret @xmath6 as some particular finite set , then it has @xmath17 members where @xmath17 is some specific finite natural number .",
    "it can have either an odd or an even number of members .",
    "it is subject to permutations just as any finite set is so subject .",
    "the availability of such interpretations makes our viewpoint different from the original interpretation of the grossone . in the original interpretation",
    ", @xmath0 is always infinite , and it is divisible by any natural number . in our interpretation @xmath0 as a symbolic entity is not a finite natural number .",
    "it stands for any top value in some finite set , but not any particular value . for",
    "this reason we can do arithmetic with @xmath0 and say that @xmath0 is taken to be greater than @xmath19 for any standard natural number @xmath19 and that @xmath64    _ in the generic context , for a statement about @xmath0 to be true , it must be true for all sufficiently large substitutions of natural numbers for @xmath8 _ for example @xmath65 is true because @xmath66 is true for all natural numbers @xmath17 that are larger than @xmath67 some statements are true for all numbers . thus @xmath68 is true since @xmath69 for all natural numbers @xmath70 in this way , we can use the grossone as an infinite number when we wish .",
    "series of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 are any real or complex numbers or algebraic expressions , are well defined .",
    "for example , we can write @xmath73 and this is a generic finite sum in the form of a geometric series .",
    "we can operate algebraically on such sums .",
    "for example , @xmath74 whence @xmath75 and so , for @xmath76 @xmath77    note that we can replace @xmath0 in this formula .",
    "for example , @xmath78 it is our intent to keep the interpretation that @xmath0 is a generic natural number , so in this sense @xmath79 can be regarded as specializing to the function @xmath80 for natural numbers @xmath14 but @xmath79 is also the generic expression for this function , and as such we can think of it as expressing cases where @xmath19 is taken to infinity .    at this point",
    "we can note the effects of taking @xmath0 even or odd , or the effect of taking a limit as @xmath0 becomes arbitrarily large .",
    "for example if the absolute value of @xmath56 is less than 1 , then @xmath81 becomes arbitrarily small as @xmath0 becomes arbitrarily large .",
    "generically , we can regard @xmath0 as an infinite number if we wish . in that case",
    "we have that @xmath82 is infinitesimally close to @xmath83 but the expression @xmath84 is a more accurate rendition of the actual situation . working with generic formalism allows us to dispense with limits in many cases and adds detail that can be sometimes ignored in the usual category of working with limits .",
    "note in the last example , that if we take @xmath85 then @xmath86 if we take @xmath0 even , then @xmath87 if we take @xmath0 to be odd , thn @xmath88 we see that @xmath89 is a well - defined symbolic value that can be either positive or negative , depending on its instantiation as a number .",
    "this is in direct contrast to sergeyev s usage for the grossone , where @xmath0 is taken to be even and so @xmath82 takes only the value @xmath90 our interpretation reflects the fact that the corresponding finite series oscillate between @xmath91 and @xmath90    here is another example",
    ". let @xmath92 this is of course a rendition of @xmath93 for large generic @xmath70 we can apply the binomial theorem to conclude that @xmath94 thus @xmath95 from this expression we can see the limit structure that leads to the usual series formula for @xmath96 and we see the luxury in the exact formula for @xmath97 by not taking the limit and examining the exact structure of the formula for large generic @xmath5 we see more and can write down more exact approximations for specific values @xmath17 substituted for the generic @xmath8    another example will show even more .",
    "let @xmath98 denote a list of all the prime numbers up to a generic natural number @xmath8 note that @xmath99 denotes a _",
    "generic prime number_. this can be compared with sergeyev s concept of infinite prime numbers @xcite .",
    "define an analogue of the riemann zeta function via @xmath100 [ \\frac{1}{1- \\frac{1}{p_{2}^{s } } } ] \\cdots   [ \\frac{1}{1- \\frac{1}{p_{\\g1}^{s } } } ] = \\sigma_{n \\in n(\\g1 ) } \\frac{1}{n^{s}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath101 denotes all natural numbers that can be constructed as products of prime powers from the set of primes @xmath102 note that there is no limit to the size of elements of @xmath103 if we wish to keep bounds on that , we will have to introduce further notation . even though @xmath104 is a finite product , it produces natural numbers of arbitrarily high size .",
    "thus a better finite zeta function will be given by @xmath105 then @xmath106 where @xmath107 denotes the generically finite set of natural numbers whose prime factorization is from the first @xmath0 primes , and whose prime powers are no higher than @xmath8 for a particular finite instantiation of @xmath0 this zeta function , being a finite sum , can be computed for any complex number @xmath108 this truncation of the usual limit version of the zeta function allows new computational investigations of its properties .",
    "this example can be compared with the work in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one possible advantage of our approach is that it is essentially a finite approach .",
    "we are suggesting that it is useful to examine the rieman zeta function , defined just for a finite collection of prime numbers , and then to examine how these finitized zeta functions behave as the number of primes used gets larger and larger .",
    "we are not concerned here with extra fine structure of the zeta function at its limit , but rather with extra structure visible in the finite approximations to it .",
    "this material will be explored further in a separate paper .",
    "but the reader may ask , does not the construction of @xmath6 connote an infinite set if we regard the grossone @xmath0 as standing for an infinite evaluation , larger than any natural number ?",
    "well , dear reader , what will you have ?",
    "should we not be able , in this putative infinity , to count down from @xmath0 by successive subtractions to some number that we found by counting up from @xmath7 by successive additions ?",
    "this is true of any finite set . yet",
    "if this is true then it must be that for some natural numbers @xmath109 we have @xmath110 and so we find that @xmath111 and so the set @xmath6 would be neither generic , nor infinite , but simply one of the multitude of finite sets , in fact , the one of the form@xmath112 once again , @xmath113 is not a set at all , but the form of a generic finite set .",
    "it is a symbol for the finite set structure , not a set at all . but this gives us freedom to regard this symbolic structure as something like a set , and in it , we indeed can not countdown from the grossone to a finite natural number .",
    "in many aspects of mathematics there is no need for any infinite set .",
    "it is sufficient to have the concept of a generic finite set . for this",
    "we need the notion of a generic natural number .",
    "thus one speaks of the set of natural numbers from @xmath7 to @xmath19 , @xmath114 , and one usually conceives this as referring to some , as yet unspecified number @xmath14 one writes a formula such as @xmath115 and it is regarded as true for any specific number @xmath14 the concept of a generic @xmath19 requires a shift of attention , but no actual change in the formalism of handling finite sets and finite series .",
    "to write @xmath116 is conceptually different from the above formula with @xmath19 . in the formula with @xmath19",
    "we are referring to _ some specific natural number @xmath19_. in the formula with grossone , we are indicating a _ form _ that is true when @xmath0 is replaced by a specific integer @xmath117 and we are also indicating the behaviour of a corresponding limit or infinite sum .    * the transfer principle .",
    "* once we take a notation for a generic natural number as with sergeyev s grossone , we are lead to use the concept of genericity . in this view",
    "@xmath0 is symbolic , not infinite , but can be regarded as indefinitely large .",
    "we can regard it as larger than any given number that is named .",
    "this is a way of thinking instantiated by our _ transfer principle : any statement @xmath16 using @xmath5 is true if there is a natural number @xmath17 such that @xmath18 is a true statement about finite natural numbers @xmath19 for all @xmath20 _ this principle provides a transfer statement that allows us to apply the grossone in many particular situations .",
    "the principle and its consequences are distinct from the sergeyev use of the grossone , and constitute a relaxation of that usage .",
    "for example , if we are working with a computer that is limited to a specific size of natural number , then from the outside , as theorists , we can easily say that @xmath0 will be greater than any number allowed in that computational domain .",
    "we can think of @xmath118 as a set that is larger than any specific finite set we care to name , but it is still generically finite and does not partake of the cantorian property of being in @xmath10 correspondence with a proper subset of itself .",
    "it is like a finite set , but it is not any particular finite set .",
    "the concept of a generic set is different from the concept of a set in the same way that the variable @xmath56 is different from a specific number in elementary algebra .",
    "a generic set such as @xmath6 does not have a cardinality in the sense of cantor .",
    "it is not in @xmath10 correspondence with any specific finite set , but if a specific natural number @xmath19 is given for @xmath0 , then the resulting set is of cardinality @xmath14 this is precisely analogous to the situation with an algebraic @xmath56 that in itself has no numerical value , but any subsititution of a number for @xmath56 results in the specific value of that number . just as we endow algebraic expressions with the same properties as the numbers that they abstract , we endow generic sets with the properties of the finite sets which they stand for",
    "* the zhigljavsky axioms .",
    "* the transfer principle can be compared with axiomatizations for the sergeyev system .",
    "for example , in @xcite , zhigljavsky takes the following set of axioms :    1 .",
    "grossone , @xmath0 is the largest natural number so that @xmath119 2 .",
    "the grossone @xmath0 is divisible by any finite natural number @xmath14 3 .   if a certain statement is valid for all @xmath19 large enough , then this statement is also valid for @xmath8 4 .",
    "assume we have a numerical sequence @xmath120 which converges to @xmath91 as @xmath121 then this sequence has a grossone - based representative @xmath122 whose last term @xmath123 is necessarily an infinitesimal quantity .",
    "we see that axiom 1 corresponds to our formalization of @xmath6 as a generic set of consective natural numbers .",
    "but we do not use formally the concept of the  set of all natural numbers \" .",
    "we do not assume axiom 2 .",
    "our transfer principle is essentially the _ same _ as axiom 3 .",
    "we agree with axiom 4 in the sense that one has the generic set @xmath124 and the symbol @xmath123 can be used to stand for a number whose absolute value is less than that of any given finite non - zero real number .",
    "( in fact it follows from the transfer principle that @xmath125 for any positive natural number @xmath14 ) this means that in both our system and in the zhigljavsky system , infinitesimals naturally arise .",
    "how they are treated may depend upon the further adoption of a theory of extended real analysis and is left open for specific applications .",
    "our point in this paper has been that the symbolic constructions of yaroslav sergeyev can be regarded as generic finite sets .",
    "does this preclude an infinite interpretation ?",
    "in the case of a series such as @xmath126 ( @xmath56 not equal to @xmath7 ) , we would like to give the interpretation that if @xmath0 is an infinite integer , and @xmath127 , then s is infinitesimally close to @xmath128 the problem with this is the same as the corresponding problem in the calculus .",
    "an integral is a limit of finite summations .",
    "we are led to imagine ( by the leibniz @xcite notation for example ) that the integral @xmath129 is an uncountably infinite sum of infinitesimal terms of the form @xmath130 it takes the language of non - standard analysis @xcite to make formal sense out of this statement .",
    "we can , using the grossone formalism , go in the other direction and articulate that integral as a generic finite sum . in order to do this",
    "we have to make a choice of method of integration and then write the formula in generic fashion .",
    "for example , consider @xmath131 we use riemann integration and choose an interval from @xmath132 to @xmath19 on the real line .",
    "we divide the interval @xmath133 $ ] up into sub - intervals of length @xmath134 this gives the partition @xmath135 of the interval @xmath136.$ ] we then have that , when the integral converges , @xmath137 thus the following finite generic expression stands for this integral .",
    "@xmath138 we can even write @xmath139 where @xmath140 is our finite version of the exponential function from the previous section . here",
    "@xmath141 where the limit is the classical limit and @xmath19 runs over the classical natural numbers .",
    "we can not write a limit as @xmath0 approaches something since @xmath0 is generic and does not approach anything other than itself .",
    "let us write @xmath142 to mean that @xmath143 and @xmath144 differ by an infinitesimal amount ( in the sense of the discussion above ) or , equivalently , that @xmath145 thus @xmath146 when @xmath147 note that @xmath142 has the following properties , making it an equivalence relation ( the first three properties ) and more .",
    "1 .   @xmath148 for any @xmath149 2 .",
    "if @xmath150 , then @xmath151 3 .   if @xmath150 and @xmath152 then @xmath153 4 .   if @xmath142 and @xmath154 then @xmath155 and @xmath156 5 .",
    "if @xmath150 then @xmath157 where @xmath158 denotes the prinicipal @xmath19-th root of the number @xmath56 ( working over the complex numbers ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath159 in appropriate cases where one checks the limiting behaviour .",
    "if @xmath160 where @xmath161 is infinitesimal , then it may happen that @xmath162 in this case one must examine the size of @xmath161 in relation to the size of @xmath163    here is an example . in the derivation that follows",
    "we will use all of the above properties of @xmath164 and we leave it for the reader to check that each of the steps is valid .",
    "we have the classical formula @xmath165 this is often seen as a consequence of the series formula for @xmath166 we can write the equation @xmath167 in particular , the well - known formula @xmath168 becomes the following generic limit formula @xmath169 in fact , we can , since this formula refers to properties of all formulas where @xmath0 is replaced by a specific integer , take roots and solve for @xmath170 as follows .",
    "@xmath171 @xmath172 @xmath173 @xmath174 @xmath175 one can verify that this last limit formula is indeed a correct limit formula for @xmath176 well - known limit formulas appear from this formula when we replace @xmath0 by @xmath177 in it .",
    "we then have @xmath178 in this version the finite versions are of the form @xmath179 and the limit formula is @xmath180 @xmath181 where @xmath182 denotes the imaginary part of the given complex number .",
    "here we have successive square roots of @xmath183 and we can use the formula @xmath184 when @xmath185 from this it is easy to derive the famous formula of @xmath186 @xmath187 the grossone notation and the notion of generic finite sets allows us to write this derivation in a concise and precise manner .",
    "in articulating the notion of the generic finite we have examined an interpretation of the grossone extension of the natural numbers of yaroslav sergeyev as a generic finite set .",
    "this works because the grossone extension puts a cap , the grossone @xmath0 , at the top of its model of the natural numbers and so formally resembles our way of thinking about a finite set such as @xmath188 where there is a least element , a greatest element , and a size for the set in the numerical sense of counting or ordinality . by working with this correspondence",

    "s language the _ size _ of the set of even natural numbers is @xmath196 since it comprises half of the natural numbers",
    ". we can discuss _ size _ in our way by the transfer principle of the previous section .",

    "if the size for the specializations ( replacing @xmath0 by specific natural numbers @xmath19 ) of a generic set @xmath198 has the form @xmath199 for a function @xmath31 of natural numbers , then we say that _ @xmath198 has size @xmath200 _ thus we assign @xmath0 as the size for @xmath201 above .",
    "this moves our theory in the direction of cantorian counting for sets even though we have not invoked a notion of @xmath10 correspondence for infinite sets .",
    "the point of this example is to show that there are are natural differences between the generic finite set approach and the sergeyev approach to the grossone .",
    "there are other relationships of the generic finite set concept and standard set theory .",
    "for example , in standard set theory we take as representative ordinals @xmath202 @xmath203 @xmath204 @xmath205 and so the _ generic finite ordinal _ is @xmath206 this should be held in contrast to the first infinite ordinal @xmath207 the generic finite ordinal has @xmath208 members and so we could name it @xmath209 in the tradition of making ordinals .",
    "however , ordinals made in this generic fashion are not well - ordered since there is no end to the descending sequence @xmath210 this means that a theory of ordinals based on generic finite sets will have a character of its own",
    ". this will be the subject of a separate paper .",
    "in this section , we take a different approach to the grossone . we assume here the existence of infinite sets and the usual terminology of point set topology . with",
    "that we discuss , by using categories , relative notions of infinity .",
    "after all , a circle is not homeomorphic to any proper subset of itself . therefore the point set for the circle , uncountable in pure set theory , is _ finite _ in the category of topological spaces !",
    "we formalize this notion below and indicate how it can be interfaced with the grossone .",
    "we recall that a _ category _ @xmath3 is a collection of _ objects _ and _ morphisms _ where a morphism is associated to two objects and is usually written as @xmath211 where @xmath2 and @xmath212 are objects .",
    "note that the morphism @xmath213 provides a directed arrow from @xmath2 to @xmath214 without further axioms the concept of a category is the same as the concept of a directed multi - graph .",
    "the axioms for a category are as follows :    1 .   given morphisms @xmath211 and @xmath215 there is a well - defined morpism called the _ composition of @xmath213 and @xmath216 _ and denoted @xmath217 the object @xmath2 is called the _ domain _ of @xmath213 and the object @xmath212 is called the _ codomain _ or _ range _ of @xmath218 2 .",
    "every object @xmath2 has a unique _ identity morphism _",
    "@xmath219 such that for any @xmath211 , @xmath220 and for any @xmath221 , @xmath222 3 .",
    "if @xmath223 @xmath224 and @xmath225 then @xmath226 thus composition of morphisms is associative .",
    "if @xmath227 and @xmath228 are categories , then we say that a _ functor _ from @xmath227 to @xmath228 , denoted @xmath229 , is a function that takes objects to objects and morphisms to morphisms such that if @xmath211 is a morphisim in @xmath227 , then @xmath230 is a morphism in @xmath231 furthermore , we require of a functor that identity morphisms are carried to identity morphisms , and that compositions are taken to compositions in the sense that @xmath232 for all compositions @xmath233 in @xmath234    in this paper we will use categories whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are maps of these sets with whatever extra structure is demanded by that category . then there is a forgetful functor @xmath235 obtained by just taking the objects as sets and the morphisms as maps of sets , ignoring the extra structure . in such categories ,",
    "a morphism @xmath211 is said to be _ injective _ if @xmath236 is injective in @xmath237 and @xmath213 is said to be _ surjective _ if @xmath236 is surjective in @xmath238    in @xmath239 one says that a set @xmath2 is _ infinite _ if there exists an injection @xmath240 that is not a surjection .",
    "if every injection of @xmath2 to itself is a surjection , we say that the the set @xmath2 is finite .",
    "we relativize this notion to other categories .",
    "if @xmath3 is a set - based category , we say that an object @xmath2 of @xmath3 is _ finite _ ( in @xmath3 ) if every injection of @xmath2 to itself _ in the category @xmath3 _ is surjective .",
    "for example consider the category @xmath241 of topological spaces .",
    "we see at once that the circle @xmath242 where @xmath243 are real numbers , is finite in this category since the circle is not homeomorphic to any proper subset of itself .",
    "thus , while the circle consists in infinitely many points when looked at under the forgetful functor to set theory , in the topological category the circle is finite .",
    "we shall see that this point of view on finite and infinite is very useful in sorting out how we deal with mathematical objects in many situtations .",
    "we now combine this topological point of view on finiteness with the grossone . in figure  [ gcircle ] we show an embedding of a union of two sets of points in the form @xmath244 ( in the figure , @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath245 ) we regard @xmath6 as embedded in a circle with two points removed .",
    "the two vertical marks on the circle in the figure denote the removed points . the circle with two points removed partakes of the subspace topology from the euclidean plane in which it is embedded .",
    "we work in the category of orientation preserving homeomorphisms of the deleted circle @xmath246 that map the the intervals @xmath247 $ ] and @xmath248 $ ] to themselves . in the categorical sense , @xmath246 is finite and there can be no such homeomorphisms that take @xmath6 to a proper subset of itself .",
    "in fact , in this model , every such homeomorphism is the identity map when restricted to @xmath11    in figure  [ graphs ] we give another example of how to topologically make an infinite set finite .",
    "we have labeled a set of graphs with the  elements \" of @xmath11 none of these graphs are homeomorphic ( we take the nodes of the graphs to be disks and the edges to be topological intervals)and so a homeomorphism of the entire collection must take each graph to itself .",
