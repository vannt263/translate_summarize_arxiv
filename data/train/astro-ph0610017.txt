    "cyg x-1 is a high - mass x - ray binary with the orbital period of @xmath3 d ( gies & bolton 1982 ) , containing a black hole ( bolton 1972 ; webster & murdin 1972 ) and the o9.7 iab supergiant hde  226868 primary ( walborn 1973 ) .",
    "although the primary nearly fills the roche lobe , accretion is via a stellar wind ( gies & bolton 1986a ; gies et al .",
    "observations of optical lines indicate that the wind departs from the spherical symmetry by being focused towards the compact object .",
    "still , only a few percent of the wind is accreted .",
    "the orbital period has been detected in all energy bands where the source was detected .",
    "x - ray modulation in the hard spectral state has the form of broad intensity dips accompanied by spectral hardening centred on the superior conjunction of the x - ray source , i.e. , when it is behind the primary ( e.g. , priedhorsky , brandt & lund 1995 ; wen et al .  1999 ;",
    "lachowicz et al .  2006 , hereafter l06 ) .",
    "the dip is a result of bound - free absorption by the wind ( wen et al .",
    "periodic changes in equivalent widths of uv absorption lines are due to the orbital motion of a highly ionized , x - ray irradiated , region of the stellar wind . in the superior conjunction ,",
    "the equivalent widths achieve the maximal values ( treves et al .",
    "1980 ) . in the visual band ,",
    "the orbital period is seen in radial velocity variations of absorption and emission lines ( e.g. , bolton 1975 ) and in ellipsoidal variations ( walker 1972 ) .",
    "the radio emission of cyg x-1 is most likely due to the synchrotron process in a jet , whose velocity has been claimed to be mildly relativistic , @xmath4 ( stirling et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter s01 ; gleissner et al .",
    "it has a flat ( in the energy flux , @xmath5 ) spectrum at @xmath620 mjy in the x - ray hard spectral state ( see , e.g. , zdziarski et al .",
    "2002 for a review of the x - ray states of cyg x-1 ) , with no detection of either low or high frequency cut - off between 2.2 and 220 ghz ( fender et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "orbital periodicity of the radio emission was discovered by han ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , more insight in it was possible thanks to long term radio monitoring of cyg x-1 by the ryle telescope at the mullard radio astronomy observatory at 15 ghz and the green bank interferometer at 2.25 and 8.3 ghz ( pooley , fender & brocksopp 1999 ; l06 ) .",
    "it was found that the total modulation depth _ in the hard state _ increases with the frequency , from @xmath70.03 at 2.25 ghz to @xmath70.3 at 15 ghz , and that there is a time lag of the minimum of the modulation with respect to the superior conjunction decreasing with the frequency , from @xmath70.3 of the orbital period at 2.25 ghz to @xmath70.15 of it at 15 ghz . in the soft state , the orbital modulation takes place as well ( l06 ) , but constraints on it are much weaker , due to the much lower on average but flaring flux ( fender et al .",
    "2006 ; l06 ) .",
    "we would like to point out that an orbital periodicity of radio emission is a rare phenomenon in x - ray binaries .",
    "it appears to be seen in only two other systems , lsi  @xmath8 ( taylor & gregory 1982 ) and cir x-1 ( whelan et al .",
    "1977 ) . both of them are of rather different nature than cyg x-1 .",
    "although their compact objects orbit around stars undergoing heavy mass loss ( as in cyg x-1 ) , the orbits are wide and highly eccentric . during the periastron passage ,",
    "the accretion rate onto the compact object is greatly enhanced and both the x - ray and radio fluxes increase ( e.g. , coe et al .  1983 ; marti & paredes 1995 ; haynes , lerche & murdin 1980 ) . on the other hand , this is certainly not the case in cyg x-1 , in which the orbit is circular ( brocksopp et al .",
    "1999b ) , and the orbital separation is similar to the diameter of the primary .",
    "thus , the nature of the orbital modulation of its radio emission has to be different .        the process likely to be responsible for the modulation of the radio emission has been identified by brocksopp , fender & pooley ( 2002 , hereafter bfp02 ) .",
    "they proposed it is free - free absorption in the stellar wind of the primary .",
    "it is then analogous to the x - ray modulation , except for the absorption being free - free rather than bound - free .",
    "unfortunately , although the work of bfp02 generally explains the origin of the radio modulation , it is plagued by a number of errors ( as noticed by l06 ) . due to those errors ,",
    "their results are generally incorrect .",
    "for example , errors in the equations and the numerical code used lead to the result that the fractional depth of the modulation _ decreases _ with the increasing inclination .",
    "this result is rather counterintuitive , as the system is fully symmetric for a face - on observer and most asymmetric for an edge - on one , and it is indeed incorrect .",
    "then , the absorption in the wind outside the cylinder defined by the orbit was underestimated by @xmath740 orders of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , they assumed a uniform and rather low wind temperature , of 5000 k. in reality , the wind is compton - heated on the side of the x - ray source to temperatures about two orders of magnitude higher ( strongly reducing the free - free opacity with respect to the treatment of bfp02 ) . also , the jet model of bfp02 was relatively simplified , assuming that emission at a given frequency is emitted entirely at a single point along a linear jet , and it did not explain the phase lags .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider models of the jet including its radial emission profile as well as its bending .",
    "we consider only the hard - state data . in modelling the stellar wind , we take into account its irradiation by the uv and x - ray photons , and propagation during the orbital motion of the primary .",
    "we model both the observed depth of the modulation as a function of frequency and the corresponding lags of the minima of the folded radio lightcurves with respect to the spectroscopic superior conjunction .",

    "we note that , with the exception of a very dense wind region close to the stellar surface , the wind is optically thin for both x - ray and uv photons .",

    "we stress that in spite of the primary having the luminosity about two orders of magnitude higher than that of the x - ray source , it is necessary to include both sources in the calculations .",

    "the difference between the transmitted fluxes integrated over the jet length at those two phases gives ( approximately , as the true minima have some phase shifts ) the modulation depth .",
    "we can see that the higher the point of emission along the jet , the lower the difference between the two transmitted profiles , and hence the lower modulation .",
    "the low-@xmath128 ( @xmath151 ) branch of the profiles is almost completely absorbed and thus the shape of the transmitted profiles and the modulation depth is only weakly dependent on @xmath113 .",

    "thus , the amplitude of the optical depth variations is higher than in the case of the vertical jet , which will then increase the strength of the modulation .",
    "also , the resulting lag behind the compact object will lead to a lag in the phase of the maximum absorption ( i.e. , the minimum flux ) , as observed .",
    "in general , the flux phase profile depends on the inclination , @xmath20 , the profile parameters ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 ) , and on the velocity profile , given by @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "then , in order to reduce the parameter space , we consider here only two velocity profiles , one with @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( corresponding to acceleration only at the jet base ) , and one with @xmath164 and a constant @xmath165 .",

    "the values of @xmath95 used in fig .",

    "there are a few essential features of our model , necessary to account for the observed orbital modulation depths and the phase lags .",
    "one is the wind heating due to the irradiation by the x - rays .",
    "this naturally creates a strong temperature anisotropy , and consequently strong anisotropy of the free - free absorption coefficient .",

    "we also point out that the range of the temperatures of the wind obtained by us , @xmath187@xmath188 k , is in full agreement with that found from _",
    "chandra _ soft x - ray observations of cyg x-1 by miller et al.(2005 ) .    for test purposes",
    ", we have also run models with a uniform wind temperature equal @xmath189 k. they required strong fine - tuning in order to achieve the observed modulation depths , as well as very low resulting transmitted fraction of the intrinsic jet flux , @xmath190 .",
    "inclusion of x - ray heating resolves those problems .",
    "another essential feature is the required low velocity of the bulk of the mass of the jet , necessary for the jet bending required to account for the observed phase lags of the flux minima ( with respect to the superior conjunction of the black hole ) .",
    "the velocity is nonrelativistic within the jet region constrained by the data .",
    "the jet bending results then from the initial jet velocity in the binary plane ( due to the orbital motion of the black hole ) being comparable to its vertical velocity component .",
    "we have searched for other ways to account for the observed phase lags , and have found none . in particular , the lags associated with the finite wind velocity together with the motion of the primary star can not account for the observations .",
    "we note that the modulation depth increases with @xmath90 in the 2.2515 ghz range .",
    "our model reproduces this increase .",
    "not unexpectedly , it predicts the depth of the orbital modulation to increase further at @xmath191 ghz .",
    "it would be of high interest to test this prediction observationally .",
    "we note that there have been rather few observations at @xmath191 ghz so far ( fender et al .",
    "2000 ; note some errors in the observation dates given there ) , insufficient for that test .",
    "a related issue is the shape of the _ intrinsic _ jet spectrum .",
    "the observed average , absorbed , spectrum , is approximately given by @xmath192 with @xmath193 in the @xmath194200 ghz range ( fender et al .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum of the jet is also likely to be a power law , in general with a value of @xmath33 allowed to be different than 0 . however , if the intrinsic index is substantially different from 0 , then obtaining the @xmath193 power law would require a specific power - law absorption law .",
    "we can obtain it with our model .",
    "however , given the relatively large number of the free parameters compared to the relatively few observational constraints , the resulting model constraints would be rather loose . on the other hand , the most natural way to obtain the observed",
    "@xmath193 is with the transmission fraction through the wind being high , close to 1 . as we show in fig .",
    "[ brokenmap ] , there is a relatively large parameter space with that fraction being high , @xmath195 , and thus this is indeed possible .",
    "the radio maps obtained from observations at 8.4 ghz ( s01 ) show the jet to form an extended feature .",
    "the flux reaches the maximum at the core of an angular size of @xmath196 mas , and then it decreases over @xmath197 mas away from it . for @xmath20 from @xmath198 to @xmath199 , 3 and 15",
    "mas correspond to ( 29@xmath200@xmath201 cm and ( 140@xmath202@xmath203 cm , respectively .",
    "our constraints are for the distances along the jet of @xmath204 at 2.25 ghz and @xmath205 at 8.3 ghz .",
    "thus , they apply only to the core of the jet .",
    "still , we can compare the predictions of our model with the radio maps of s01 at larger distances using the double - power - law profiles .",
    "we find that the observed extended structure of the jet is substantially more luminous than the predictions of our simple models .",
    "the propagation of the jet beyond the core may be affected by various effects , e.g. , its moving away from the stellar wind region , and this issue is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we note that the 2.2515 ghz monitoring data used by us are integrated over the entire observed source .",
    "the emission at a given frequency from outside of the jet core is very unlikely to be modulated by the stellar wind .",
    "thus , the fractional modulation of the emission close to the jet base has to be actually somewhat higher than that used by us , in order to account for the constant part emitted outside the core . according to the results of s01 ,",
    "the 8.4 ghz flux from the extended part is less than or similar to that of the core .",
    "then , the fractional modulation of the core emission should be higher by a factor @xmath206 than that averaged over the entire structure , but the values of the phase lags are not affected .",
    "it is possible to reproduce the core emission profiles with such a modulation depth in our model .",
    "the required profiles are located to the left of the 8.3 ghz region in fig .",
    "[ brokenmap ] , which introduces only a small change in the value of the acceleration , reducing it only by at most 10 per cent .",
    "then , the results of s01 show that the 15.4 ghz emission is mostly in the core of the extend of @xmath206 mas , with only @xmath207 per cent of the emission outside the core .",
    "this is approximately compatible with our spatial emission profiles .",
    "then , no radio maps are available at @xmath194 ghz .",
    "our models yield the jet acceleration of @xmath208@xmath209 cm s@xmath104 . at @xmath179 ,",
    "the jet achieves the velocity of @xmath210@xmath211 cm s@xmath1 , and @xmath212 times that at @xmath213 , i.e. , @xmath214 in both cases . on the other hand , s01 has estimated the jet velocity to be mildly relativistic based on the lack of the observed counter jet being explained by the relativistic doppler beaming",
    ". the results of s01 combined with the constraints of gleissner et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( based on the lack of radio  x - ray correlations on m",
    " h time scales ) yield the jet velocity of @xmath215@xmath216 .",
    "this requires an acceleration @xmath217 times higher than that estimated by us .",
    "we note , however , that our results do not constrain at all the jet region at @xmath218 .",
    "thus , the acceleration there can be much higher , e.g. , due to the stellar wind density being much lower than in the inner jet region .",
    "another argument for the relativistic bulk velocity of the jet electrons emitting synchrotron radiation is the presence of the superorbital ( i.e. , on a time scale much longer than the orbital period ) modulation .",
    "the modulation , with the period of @xmath219 d , is present in both radio and x - rays ( e.g. , brocksopp et al .  1999a ; l06 ) .",
    "the standard ( though not proven ) explanation of that effect in cyg x-1 ( and a number of other x - ray binaries ) is precession ( e.g. , larwood 1998 ; l06 ) .",
    "then , the jet precession can cause the flux variability at this period if the jet is at least mildly relativistic .",
    "the radio data on the superorbital modulation are compatible with this picture as the modulation depth at the three monitored frequencies , 2.25 , 8.3 and 15 ghz , is compatible with being constant , and there are no significant phase lags .",
    "we note , however , that those data do not require the jet velocity to be relativistic in the core , as the superorbital modulation can be caused by electrons outside it .",
    "also , the required velocity can be as low as @xmath220 if the ( unknown ) precession amplitude is @xmath221 .    on the other hand , we can provide here an explanation for the superorbital radio modulation without invoking a relativistic jet velocity .",
    "namely , a precessing jet moves with respect to the wind structure ( which is defined only by the binary orbit and does not precess ) .",
    "the line of sight from a given point in the jet , and thus the amount of the orbit - averaged free - free absorption in the wind , will then change with the superorbital phase ( without phase lags ) .",
    "however , the modulation depth is frequency - dependent in this model . in principle , it is possible to find parameters of the system yielding the same modulation depth from 2 to 15 ghz , but it requires certain fine - tuning .",
    "as we have discussed above , the observed phase lags of the orbital radio modulation require that the bulk of the jet mass is nonrelativistic within the region where most of the radio emission takes place . on the other hand , the non - detection of the counter jet and the superorbital radio modulation point to ( though not completely require ) relativistic bulk motion of most of the synchrotron - emitting electrons .",
    "this apparent contradiction may be reconciled provided that the jet contains two flows at different velocities , e.g. , an outer slow part and a fast inner part .    such a model for radio - emitting x - ray binaries",
    "has been recently proposed by ferreira et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . it is based on an analogous , two - flow , model for extragalactic radio jets of sol , pelletier & asso ( 1989 ) . the main contribution to the total jet power",
    "is an electron - proton plasma that is either nonrelativistic in x - ray binaries or mildly relativistic in agn jets .",
    "this plasma is generated by an mhd process in a large - scale magnetic field anchored in the accretion disc .",
    "the second flow is composed of relativistic e@xmath222 pairs , and it carries only a small fraction of the total power .",
    "it is produced in the inner regions of the mhd flow , where the pairs are created and then accelerated .",
    "the outer flow confines the inner one . in the agn case ,",
    "the outer slow flow is identified with kpc - scale jets , fuelling the radio lobes and hotspots , and the fast inner flow is identified with pc - scale jets and the superluminal motion ( sol et al .",
    "we note that the specific model of ferreira et al .",
    "( 2006 ) postulates that the threshold for pair production , forming the inner fast jet , is reached only above the accretion rates corresponding to the hard spectral state .",
    "a massive disk outflow ( linked with the super - eddington mass transfer rate ) has been proposed to exist in the x - ray binary ss  433 ( zitter , calvani & dodoricio 1991 ; fabrika 1993 , 2004 ) .",
    "the outflow , with the velocity of @xmath223 cm s@xmath1 , is radiatively driven from outer parts of the accretion disc .",
    "its direction is determined by the tilt of the disc and is subject to both precessional and nutational motions of the outer disc .",
    "begelman , king & pringle ( 2006 ) then postulated that the outflow is massive enough to deflect the relativistic jet launched from the vicinity of the accreting object and to align it with the outflow axis .",
    "in the case of cyg x-1 , we may identify the slow flow with the one needed to explain the radio phase lags , and the fast one , with that at a relativistic motion explaining the invisibility of the counter jet and the superorbital modulation .",
    "however , this identification requires modifications of the above models to allow for the existence of the two flows already at lower accretion rates , corresponding to the hard spectral state .",
    "we further note that our postulated slow ( and dark ) flow is very likely to be identical to that found by gallo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to be required to power the radio lobes of cyg x-1 .",
    "the kinetic power of that flow was found by gallo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to be comparable to the x - ray luminosity . on the other hand , heinz ( 2006 ) found that the kinetic power carried by fields and radio - emitting electrons in the visible jet of cyg x-1 was much smaller .",
    "this is in agreement with the picture in which the visible ( fast ) flow is confined by the dark ( slow ) one .",
    "also , heinz ( 2006 ) estimated the velocity of the dark flow powering the radio lobes of cyg x-1 as @xmath224 cm s@xmath1 .",
    "this is in agreement with the velocity constrained by the radio modulation , see section [ general ] above .",
    "cyg x-3 is an example of another high - mass x - ray binary with the companion emitting strong wind and with very strong orbital modulation of x - rays , thought to be caused by absorption and scattering in the wind .",
    "it also has strong radio emission , most likely originating from a jet of that system .",
    "still , no orbital modulation of the radio emission is seen ( hjalmarsdotter et al .",
    "2004 ) .    to explain this lack of modulation",
    ", we first point out that cyg x-3 is a much more compact system than cyg x-1 . the orbital period of the former is only 4.8 hr . cherepashchuk & moffat ( 1994 ) have estimated its orbital separation as @xmath225@xmath226 cm , an order of magnitude less than that of cyg x-1 .",
    "the degree of asymmetry of the wind at a given height , @xmath128 , is proportional to @xmath227 .",
    "thus , if the jet of cyg x-3 emits a given radio frequency at the same height as cyg x-1 , its orbital modulation will be still much lower .",
    "furthermore , the companion star in cyg x-3 is a wolf - rayet star , which mass loss rate , estimated as @xmath228@xmath229 yr@xmath1 ( ogley , bell burnell & fender 2001 ) , is much higher than that of the ob star in cyg x-1 .",
    "thus , the radio emission originating relatively close to the jet base is likely to be completely free - free absorbed in cyg x-3 .",
    "the high mass - loss rate coupled with the small separation also makes the wind optically thick to x - rays , not allowing us to use our optically - thin model ( section [ wind ] ) .    the height from which a radio frequency is predominantly observed is then roughly at @xmath230 ( blandford & knigl 1979 ) .",
    "the power of the jet is , in turn , @xmath231 , with @xmath2321 ( e.g. , migliari & fender 2006 ) . the x - ray luminosity of cyg x-3 is @xmath233100 ) times that of cyg x-1 ( e.g. , gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ; vilhu et al .",
    "this consideration also points out to the height of radio emission in cyg x-3 being significantly higher than that in cyg x-1 .",
    "consequently , the wind at the radio - emitting region in cyg x-3 is likely to be almost completely axially symmetric , resulting in no orbital modulation in the radio range .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .",
    "we find the observational data on the orbital modulation of the radio emission from cyg x-1 fully consistent with the emission originating in a jet .",
    "as postulated before , the modulation is caused by free - free absorption in the wind from the companion , with the line of sight changing during the orbital motion .",
    "we find a crucial role of x - ray irradiation of the wind in enhancing its axial asymmetry with respect to the jet axis .",
    "the irradiation strongly increases the wind temperature , up to the compton temperature of @xmath70 k , in the vicinity of the x - ray source , which then strongly reduces the free - free absorption on the side of the black hole .",
    "it also increases the overall wind temperature to @xmath234 k ( except for the vicinity of the companion ) , which is about one order of magnitude above the star temperature .",
    "this reduces the constant component of the free - free absorption and allows the transmitted fraction of the radio emission to be close to unity .",
    "consequently , the intrinsic jet emission is likely to be close to the observed flat radio spectrum ( fender et al .",
    "the wind temperatures calculated by us agree with those inferred from the _ chandra _ data ( miller et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "another crucial requirement following from our study is the velocity of the bulk of the mass of the jet being nonrelativistic , @xmath235 cm s@xmath1 , in the jet core ( within @xmath236 cm ) .",
    "it follows from the relatively large phase lags of the absorption maxima with respect to the spectroscopic zero phase .",
    "the only explanation of these lags appears to be a kinematic bending of the jet caused by the initial jet velocity in the binary plane ( equal to the orbital velocity of the black hole ) being comparable ( though still substantially lower ) to the jet vertical velocity in the region where most of the 215 ghz emission is produced . also , the data imply that the above velocity is reached following an approximately constant acceleration within the core , while a rapid , instantaneous - like acceleration is ruled out",
    ".    however , the jet may then become mildly relativistic outside of the core , as implied by the lack of a detectable counter jet ( s01 ) .",
    "also , the synchrotron - emitting electrons may have a relativistic bulk motion already in the core if the jet is composed of two components , a slow , heavy , dark outer flow , and a relativistic , light , and bright inner flow ( as proposed by several authors in order to explain other observational features of jets ) .",
    "we also consider the observed superorbital modulation of the radio emission , with the period of @xmath2 d. that modulation can be caused by the doppler effect in a relativistic precessing jet .",
    "however , we find we can also explain that modulation by the free - free absorption varying due to the jet precession .",
    "when the precessing jet is inclined towards the observer , the average absorption of its emission is weaker .",
    "we construct specific models constraining the distribution of the radio emission at a given frequency along the jet .",
    "the lower the frequency , the higher up it is emitted , and thus it is less modulated by the absorption , as observed . within the 90 per cent confidence intervals , our results are compatible with the @xmath132 law of blandford & knigl ( 1979 ) .",
    "our results are also compatible with the plausible values of the inclination of cyg x-1 , @xmath221@xmath198 . for a given model , the higher the inclination , the deeper the modulation .",
    "a prediction from our models is that the modulation depth should increase with frequency also at @xmath237 ghz .",
    "thus , future monitoring at those frequencies would be of great importance for our understanding of the jet structure .",
    "we also consider the issue why there is no observed radio modulation in cyg x-3 , which system is also powered by wind accretion and which shows strong orbital modulation of its x - ray emission .",
    "we find a major reason for the lack of radio modulation is its orbital separation being an order of magnitude lower than in cyg x-1 , thus strongly reducing the wind asymmetry seen from the jet . also , it has much higher both the wind rate and the luminosity , which both factors imply radio emission take place at higher heights than in cyg x-1 ( further reducing any asymmetry of the wind seen from the jet ) .    finally , we point out that our treatment of the jet and the wind has still neglected their dynamical interactions .",
    "we also treat jet emission only in the core ( where it is modulated ) , and do not model its observed extended component .",
    "these issues can be addressed in future work .",

    "<S> also , the jet can have a two - component structure , being slow on the outside and fast inside , in which case its synchrotron - emitting part may be relativistic already in the core . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the observed superorbital modulation of the radio emission ( with the period of @xmath2 d ) and find it can be explained by a jet precession both causing variable wind absorption and changing the jet doppler factor . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider the case of cyg x-3 , and show that its lack of observable orbital radio modulation ( in spite of strong modulation of x - rays ) is explained by that system being both much more compact and much more luminous than cyg x-1 .    </S>",
