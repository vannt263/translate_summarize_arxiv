    "the last eighteen months have seen a dramatic transformation in our understanding of the nature of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the discovery of ots associated with grbs ( _ e.g. _ ) has led in turn to direct proof that these objects are at cosmological distances ( _ e.g. _ ) .",
    "analyses of the spectra and temporal behavior of the afterglows from the radio to the x - ray @xcite have confirmed that we are observing expanding relativistic fireballs @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the ultimate astrophysical source of grbs remains obscure .",
    "the most widely discussed mechanisms for producing grbs  binary neutron - star or black hole - neutron star mergers , and the collapse of massive stars @xcite  should be associated with star formation , and indeed a number of well - studied grb hosts do show signs of intensive star - formation @xcite .",
    "additionally , the distribution of host galaxy magnitudes is consistent with a model that links the rate of grbs at a given epoch of time with the star - formation rate at the epoch @xcite .",
    "but it is the location of the grbs in their host galaxies which one might expect to distinguish between binary merger and massive stellar collapse , also know as hypernovae , models @xcite .",
    "binaries containing a neutron star should travel far from their birthplace before merger due to the kicks neutron stars receive at birth both from the loss of mass in the binary , and from possibly large impulses from the supernovae @xcite .",
    "indeed , neutron star binaries may frequently escape their host galaxy before merger @xcite , preventing the creation of an afterglow and perhaps even the grb itself , due to the absence of a dense external working surface @xcite .",
    "however , grbs caused by hypernovae would be expected to occur at the locations of star formation , and thus might be frequently enshrouded in dust @xcite .",
    "although the optical colors of some ots have shown evidence of moderate extinction @xcite , and the inability of observers to find ots for some grbs has been interpreted as possible evidence of dust obscuration @xcite , there is little direct evidence that grbs occur in regions of high extinction .",
    "grb  980329 , however , appeared to be an excellent candidate for a dust enshrouded grb .",
    "its ot was not discovered until a radio identification @xcite allowed optical observers to re - examine images taken on the first night after outburst . the first image to show an ot was an uncalibrated @xmath0-band image @xcite .",
    "the derived magnitude @xmath7 at 0.8 days after outburst was surprising given that a much deeper @xmath1-band image taken at the same time @xcite found the source to have @xmath8 .",
    "although the @xmath0-band value has now been calibrated and its brightness lowered to @xmath9 ( this value will appear in a forthcoming version of reichart et al .",
    "1998 ) the @xmath10 color , 2.8 , is extremely red .",
    "subsequent imaging in @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath1 has shown that this ot also has very red @xmath13 and @xmath14 colors ( see reichart et al .",
    "1998 for a clear and comprehensive review of the observations of this object ; a complete table of the optical and near - infrared observations on this object is also available in palazzi et al .",
    "1998 ) . while the very red @xmath13 and @xmath15 colors can be explained by strong extinction ,",
    "it is difficult to reproduce the very steep @xmath10 color by such a model , given that the observed @xmath3 is quite blue .",
    "indeed , in order to do so , one must either discount the @xmath0 band image , or stretch the errors to their limits @xcite . here",
    ", it is assumed that the data are correct and not misleading . to fit the data ,",
    "a radical but plausible alternative is proposed : grb  980329 occurred at a redshift of @xmath16 .",
    "although measurements of the ot of grb  980329 were taken in the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 bands , on no single day are good data available in more than two of these bands ( see table 1 of reichart et al . for a complete list of the available observations ) .",
    "the standard method of dealing with this situation would be to determine the index of the power - law decay of the ot , and use this to interpolate to a common time .",
    "however , as will shortly be shown , the crucial observation was the @xmath0 band detection of the ot , and the object was observed in @xmath0 only on the first night .",
    "we are therefore forced to extrapolate the later time @xmath11 and @xmath12 observations back to the first night . to do this",
    ", we use two methods , but both rely on the assumption that the flux density in the different bands falls with the same temporal power law .",
    "this assumption should be correct so long as a spectral break in the synchrotron emission of the ot did not pass through the waveband of interest between the times of the different observations used for the analysis . as noted by reichart et al .",
    "( 1998 ) the power - law indices obtained for the @xmath1-band data , @xmath17 , and the @xmath11-band data , @xmath18 , agree within the errors . since these two bands represent the short and long wavelengths ends of the spectral region of interest , the assumption of a single power - law index should be good for all the data .",
    "furthermore , the average of these two values @xmath19 agrees well with the power - law indices determined for a number of bursts @xcite .",
    "if one then employs the average power - law index of @xmath20 to extrapolate the @xmath12 and @xmath11 magnitudes back to the time of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images on the first night , 29.9 march 1998 , one finds estimated magnitudes of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . as a check on these numbers",
    ", one can also subtract the observed @xmath23 color determined at the one time when both bands were observed , 2.3 april 1998 , from the observed @xmath1 magnitude for 29.9 march 1998 .",
    "one then finds a @xmath11 magnitude of @xmath24 , which is , within the errors , identical to the @xmath11 magnitude estimated previously .",
    "if one additionally adds the @xmath25 color of 6.3 april 1998 to the @xmath11 magnitude derived for 29.9 march 1998 , one again arrives at a @xmath12 magnitude of @xmath26 . for the remainder of the paper ,",
    "then , the values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 will be assumed for 29.9 march 1998 .",
    "these derived magnitudes have been corrected for galactic foreground extinction , converted to @xmath29jy and plotted in figure  1 .",
    "the @xmath0 band magnitude used is this figure is the recalibrated value ( @xmath30 ) determined by reichart et al .",
    "the foreground galactic extinction used , @xmath31 , is that predicted by the 100  @xmath29 iras maps following the method of schlegel , finkbeiner and davis ( 1997 ) .",
    "in addition to the galactic extinction adjusted flux densities of the ot , the figure displays a sloping line of the form @xmath32 .",
    "if , as the temporal index indicates , our observing frequency is above @xmath33 ( the frequency associated with the minimum specific energy @xmath34 imparted by the shock to the radiating electrons ) , then the expected ( unextincted ) spectral slope is @xmath35 the temporal index of @xmath20 , or @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath0 magnitudes clearly fit the spectral slope well , while the @xmath1 magnitude is about a factor of @xmath37 below the line . while it is hard to understand how dust could produce a decrement of a factor of @xmath38 in @xmath10 while leaving @xmath39 unaffected , there is a well - observed astrophysical phenomenon completely consistent with the observations : the absorption of light by the ly@xmath5 forest . at high redshift intergalactic clouds of hydrogen",
    "cross any random line of sight sufficiently frequently to significantly reduce the observed far uv continuum of a background source .",
    "the strength of this absorption depends on the frequency of the light and the redshift of the background source . at redshifts @xmath40 ,",
    "the absorption primarily occurs at rest wavelengths shorter than the lyman limit , @xmath41 ; however , at higher redshifts , the ly@xmath5 forest becomes sufficiently dense that rest wavelengths up to ly@xmath5 ( @xmath42 ) become significantly depressed @xcite . for a @xmath4 object , this depression , or ly@xmath5 break ,",
    "occurs in the observer s frame at @xmath43 .",
    "thus @xmath4 objects will be @xmath1  dropouts \" .",
    "indeed , madau ( 1995 ) predicts a suppression of @xmath44 of the flux of an object at @xmath4 shorter than @xmath42 , and observations of spectroscopically confirmed @xmath4 galaxies @xcite agree well with this prediction ( see figure 4 in spinrad et al .",
    "1998 ) , with the observed depression perhaps slightly greater than predicted ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "therefore not only does the wavelength of the break in the ot spectrum agree with a @xmath4 , but also the magnitude of the break agrees with that observed .",
    "it should perhaps also be noted that the `` dropout '' technique has worked successfully not only at @xmath4 , but also at  lower \" redshifts ( @xmath46 ) @xcite , and thus is a well - tested technique for obtaining photometric redshifts .    to quantify the range of redshifts consistent with the data , one can convolve a relatively typical ccd response curve ( the stis ccd was used ) with the harris r filter transmission function ( kpno filter # 1466 ) to simulate the full @xmath1 response of the observing telescopes .",
    "one finds that if the ly@xmath5 depression is 90% , then the break spectrum would have to be at @xmath47 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath48 ) to produce a reduction in observed @xmath1 of 3.5  still significantly less than that observed .",
    "but if the true ly@xmath5 decrement is closer to the @xmath49 predicted , the break would have to occur out of the @xmath1 band and into the @xmath0 ( and thus have a @xmath50 ) to have the observed colors .",
    "the reader may be concerned that there could be another cause for this large spectral break .",
    "decrements nearly this large have been observed due to other causes in very rare objects ( _ e.g. _ the 2800  break in the iron low - ionization broad absorption quasar first j1555633.8 + 351758 , becker et al .",
    "however , the agreement of the break wavelength and the break magnitude would then have to be entirely coincidental .",
    "rather , given the good agreement between break wavelength and expected decrement , the possibility that grb  980329 occurred at @xmath51 must be taken seriously .",
    "it is important to note that the fireball model does not predict any spectral break of the magnitude of the one seen here @xcite .",
    "and although the lightcurve of grb  970228 has shown some unpredicted but comparatively small variability ( see , for example , fruchter et al .",
    "1998 ) , in general the evidence that ots behave according to the fireball model is quite good @xcite .",
    "there is yet another piece of circumstantial evidence which suggests grb  980329 may be at @xmath4 .",
    "the temporal decay of the ot only fits a power - law if one assumes that nearly all of the observed flux in the @xmath1 band observations is from the ot and thus is not significantly contaminated by the host . indeed , even a host as faint as @xmath52 would cause a significant distortion of the power - law decay .",
    "however , only one other grb host is this faint ( see hogg and fruchter 1998 for a review of host magnitudes )  that of grb  971214 .",
    "this host has a spectroscopically measured redshift of @xmath53 @xcite and has @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "yet with @xmath53 one would expect the @xmath55 magnitude to be partially suppressed by ly@xmath5 absorption ; thus the source is probably intrinsically brighter .",
    "furthermore , the apparent @xmath56 ( the knee of the luminosity function ) for galaxies at @xmath4 is expected to be approximately 26 mag @xcite .",
    "the limit on the host magnitude is already fainter than an @xmath56 galaxy at @xmath4 .",
    "were grb  980329 truly at @xmath4 , the implications for our understanding of the energetics and beaming of grbs would be profound .",
    "as noted by in t zand et al .",
    "( 1998 ) the fluence of grb  980329 in the 50 - 300 kev of @xmath57 ergs s@xmath58 @xmath59 would place it in the top 4% of grbs in the batse 4b catalog @xcite . with an assumed cosmology of h@xmath60 km",
    "/ s and @xmath61 this fluence implies an isotropic burst would have emitted @xmath62 ergs in gamma rays alone .",
    "this is equivalent to the rest mass of a 2 @xmath63 object , and would therefore imply strong beaming for any of the grb mechanisms discussed earlier .",
    "however , the implications of a @xmath4 burst may be nearly as great for cosmology as for the grb field .",
    "grb  980329 is only one of 9 bursts with well - identified optical transients ( see hogg and fruchter 1998 ) .",
    "this result would imply that @xmath64 of bursts are at @xmath65 and @xmath66 of bursts are at @xmath67 . and ,",
    "if grb  980239 is any indication , these high - redshift bursts will fairly frequently be bright enough to be detected in the optical by a 1-m telescope !",
    "indeed , the apparent magnitude of these objects could allow unprecedented studies of the galactic and intergalactic medium at extremely high redshifts through high resolution spectroscopy either from 10-m class telescopes on the ground or from ngst .",
    "although at the time of this writing the ot should have faded by a factor of @xmath68 from the flux densities shown in figure  1 , the opportunity to measure the redshift of grb  980329 may not be lost .",
    "the host galaxies of all other grbs with confirmed ots have been found .",
    "if grb  980329 also has a host galaxy , then the light from that host will suffer the same attenuation in the intergalactic medium as the ot , and the @xmath10 color of the host , like that of the ot , should be larger than 2",
    ". while quite possible apparent magnitudes of the host ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) are daunting , they are within the capabilities of the next imaging instrument planned for hst , the advanced camera for surveys .",
    "therefore , the surprising conclusion of this paper , that grb  980329 may have been at @xmath4 , need not go untested .",
    "i would like to thank elena pian , whose comment that the power - law decay of the ot of grb  980329 implied a very faint ( and perhaps as yet undetected ) host led me to think carefully about this object .",
    "sylvio klose , james rhoads , daniel reichart and francisco castander generously shared their data and calibrated values of the i - band magnitude before publication .",
    "steve thorsett provided valuable comments on the draft .",
    "i would also like to thank my colleagues at stsci , and , in particular , mark dickinson , harry ferguson , piero madau and massimo stiavelli for many enjoyable and informative conversations on the properties of high redshift galaxies ."
