    "there exists various physical systems for which a centralized control implementation is not a suitable solution @xcite .",
    "the two main reasons for this are : ( i ) the physical system is spread over a wide area , which makes communication to a central hub expensive and prompt to data loss ( power networks , traffic networks , etc . ) @xcite , ( ii ) the physical system is a composition of individual subsystems with clearly defined physical boundaries ( autonomous vehicles , swarms of robots , etc ) . in the context of model - based predictive controllers ,",
    "there is a third situation in which centralized control is not a viable solution , and it has to do with computational requirements .",
    "model predictive control ( mpc ) is a mature control technique that provides safe and stabilizing control under appropriate design @xcite .",
    "however , in order to compute the control action to be applied to the plant , it needs to solve an optimization problem at each time instant . clearly then , plants with fast dynamics and a large number of control variables are out of the scope of standard centralized mpc implementations . a natural solution to this problem is to split the plant into smaller subsystems , and then to design local controllers .",
    "however , this creates residual interaction between different subsystems , which must be taken into account if control guarantees are to be delivered .",
    "many distributed mpc ( dmpc ) implementations have been devised to tackle this problem ( for a detailed review see @xcite ) .",
    "the main aspect in which they differ is in which type of interaction is allowed between subsystems , and how this is treated . in recent years , robust mpc techniques such as tube mpc ( tmpc ) @xcite and others ( for example @xcite ) , have inspired several dmpc approaches @xcite .",
    "the main idea of such approaches is to treat the interactions between subsystems as local disturbances that may be handled ( conservatively ) by robust local controllers .",
    "communication and iteration between subsystems is then used in different ways to reduce the conservativeness induced by use of a robust method .",
    "all of these approaches , either implicitly or explicitly , rely on stabilizability assumptions .",
    "these usually require the existence of a global linear feedback with a certain structure affine to the interaction pattern of the global system .",
    "this type of assumption is also present in dmpc techniques that are not based on robust approaches such as @xcite .    in this paper , a fundamental relation that exists between this type of stabilizability assumption , and the various concepts of invariance employed by ( tube - based ) dmpc architectures ,",
    "is made explicit . to the best of the authors knowledge",
    ", this relation has not been studied explicitly before ( although some related results have been published , which we survey in section 3 ) , albeit the global stabilizability assumption is present ( either explicitly or implicitly ) in many of the dmpc approaches proposed to date .",
    "first , a collection of linear local robust controllers is introduced in order to study the stabilizability of the global plant from a decentralized perspective .",
    "the main result states that a sufficient condition for global stabilizability is that these local controllers are locally stabilizing and constraint admissible .",
    "although very simple , the proposed controllers sit at the core of many tube - based dmpc architectures , which makes this result relevant to the state of the art in dmpc .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec.2 ] defines the preliminaries and standard assumptions found in many tube - based dmpc implementations . in order to contextualize the results given in this paper , section [ sec.3 ] discusses two approaches that are commonly used to meet the previously stated assumptions .",
    "the main result is given in section [ sec.4 ] , and three examples are presented in section [ sec.5 ] in order to illustrate the result , and highlight its advantages and limitations . finally , section [ sec.6 ] provides some conclusions .",
    "the set of consecutive integers @xmath0 is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "a block - diagonal matrix @xmath2 with blocks @xmath3 and @xmath4 is denoted as @xmath5 . a vector @xmath6 that is formed by vertically stacked vectors @xmath7 with @xmath4 is denoted as @xmath8 . if @xmath2 is a matrix , @xmath9 is the spectral radius of @xmath2 ; if @xmath10 then s is schur . if @xmath11 and @xmath12 are sets , then @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( minkowski sum and pontryagin difference respectively ) . if @xmath15 is a collection of sets with @xmath4 , then @xmath16 .",
    "the matrix @xmath17 is the identity of dimension @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 is the value of @xmath6 at time @xmath20 , then @xmath21 is the prediction of @xmath22 made at time @xmath23 .",
    "first consider the general problem of regulating a network of @xmath24 , possibly heterogeneous , linear time invariant ( lti ) systems that interact with each other via states and inputs .",
    "for all @xmath4 the dynamics of subsystem @xmath25 are represented by the following state space model @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the state and input vectors belonging to subsystem @xmath29 at time @xmath20 , with matrices @xmath30 of corresponding dimension .",
    "the set @xmath31 is referred to as the set of neighbours of subsystem @xmath25 , and contains the indexes of all the other subsystems that affect the dynamics of @xmath25 .",
    "given the assumed non - centralized nature of the plant , consider the case in which each subsystem @xmath25 is subject to local constraints of the form @xmath32    [ ass.1 ] for all @xmath4 , the pair @xmath33 is stabilizable and the set @xmath34 is compact , convex and contains the origin in its interior .",
    "to simplify the analysis , assume that the subsystems do not share states and/or inputs .",
    "the collection of local models forms the following global constrained lti model : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 are compose by the blocks @xmath30 , and @xmath39      one of the main questions in distributed control is how to guarantee certain properties at the global scale ( stability , constraint satisfaction , etc . ) , from a possibly distributed design . in order to achieve these global properties , many dmpc implementations employ synthesis procedures that are either centralized @xcite , or require the solution of problems that can be computationally expensive @xcite . in this context , and in particular with tube - based dmpc controllers , the following assumption is usually required ( see for example @xcite ) ,    [ ass.2 ] there exists a collection of local linear feedbacks @xmath40 such that @xmath41 is schur for all @xmath4 and @xmath42 is schur , with @xmath43 .",
    "assumption [ ass.2 ] demands the existence of a globally stabilizing linear feedback @xmath44 with a block - diagonal structure .",
    "this definitively limits the class of systems that can be controlled with such techniques , but a more pressing issue in the context of decentralized control , is that searching for a collection of local feedbacks that fulfils assumption [ ass.2 ] usually requires centralized computations .",
    "there is a vast literature dedicated to analysing the impact that _ naive _ local control design has over global behaviour ( see for example @xcite ) , but perhaps an example is enough to clarify the problem .",
    "[ exmp.1 ] consider the coupled integrators @xmath45 the local linear feedbacks @xmath46 result in @xmath47 , however , @xmath48 .",
    "example [ exmp.1 ] makes clear that careful ( perhaps centralized ) design is required to meet assumption [ ass.2 ] .",
    "the main result of this paper is to make explicit the fundamental relation that exists between the stabilizability requirements in assumption [ ass.2 ] and the standard notions of invariance that are usually implicit in dmpc controllers . to aid this ,",
    "various concepts of invariance are now defined .",
    "[ def.1 ] a set @xmath49 is said to be a pi set for the dynamics @xmath50 if @xmath51 .    [ def.3 ] a set @xmath52 is said to be a rpi set for the disturbed dynamics @xmath53 and disturbance @xmath54 if @xmath55 .",
    "[ rem.4 ] non - compact or singleton invariant sets are not considered a valid solution in the following analysis .    [ rem.3 ] in view of remark [ rem.4 ] , unstable closed - loop dynamics do not accept invariant sets as described by definitions [ def.1 ] and [ def.3 ] .",
    "the task of finding local linear feedbacks that fulfil assumption [ ass.2 ] ( or a similar one ) appears in different steps of the implementation of dmpc controllers .",
    "some of the techniques used to compute these feedbacks also exploit notions of invariance , and are implicitly related to the more fundamental result shown in this paper . in order to put this result into context , two of these approaches are briefly discussed .      in the general dmpc framework",
    "( not necessarily tube - based approaches ) , a common practice is to tackle the distributed controller synthesis problem from a centralized perspective , and to pose a set of lmis whose solution(s ) provides an adequate candidate for the required controller ( these lmis represent standard lyapunov stability conditions in the context of mpc ) . in @xcite a global linear feedback , which is forced to be zero wherever",
    "there is no dynamical coupling , is proposed to play the role of the local terminal controller often used in the mpc framework @xcite . in order to find this feedback , a set of local lmis",
    "is posed alongside with a single global lmi of dimension @xmath56 ( where n is the overall dimension of the plant ) .",
    "a similar problem is found in @xcite , where a distributed optimization approach is proposed to find the solution to the local lmis , in the presence of a system - wide coupled lmi .",
    "the problem of finding _ separable _ pi sets is tackled in a similar way in @xcite , where a set of lmis is proposed to find simultaneously a set of local independent feedbacks @xmath40 that fulfil assumption [ ass.2 ] , and a corresponding collection of joint pi sets .",
    "this procedure is proposed to tackle disturbed local dynamics , but even when no disturbance is considered , the smaller lmi is of dimension @xmath57 .      although not explicitly stated , the concept of positively invariant families of sets ( pifs ) , introduced by @xcite , can also be used to analyse the link between local and global closed - loop behaviour ( in a centralized fashion ) .",
    "the concept of pifs is more general than definition [ def.1 ] but it is based on the same invariance properties .",
    "the main advantage of the specific parametrization proposed in @xcite is that , in the context of global to local dynamics , the dimension of the problem can be considerably reduced ( from @xmath18 to @xmath24 ) by looking at what the authors call a _",
    "comparison _ system .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that : ( i ) a stable comparison system is a sufficient condition for the true system to accept a pifs , and ( ii ) if a system admits a pifs , then it admits a pi set , which therefore means that the closed - loop dynamics are stable . in this context",
    ", it might prove _ easier _ to find a stable comparison system ( of dimension @xmath24 ) and then relate it to the global system in closed loop form with a particularly structured @xmath44 .",
    "this notion is the underlying idea of the approach proposed in @xcite , where local lmis are constructed in order to find , in a non - centralized fashion , a collection of local gains @xmath40 that fulfils assumption [ ass.2 ] , and a corresponding pifs .    in all of the these approaches ,",
    "there is no guarantee that a solution does exist for the proposed set of lmis ( or stable comparison system ) .",
    "this should not be a surprise , given that the successful synthesis of a non - centralized controller depends greatly on the size of the interaction between neighbouring subsystems , and how these are dealt with ( communication , iterative optimization , etc . ) .",
    "the fundamental result shown in this paper stems from the invariance notions implicit in the robust control technique known as tube mpc @xcite , and its application to distributed control .",
    "suppose that subsystem @xmath25 has no means of obtaining information about what its neighbours plans are .",
    "a sensible , yet conservative , way of performing non - centralized control is to view the dynamical interaction between subsystems as disturbances that must be rejected . in order to move forward ,",
    "the following assumption is required .",
    "[ ass.4 ] state and input constraints are satisfied by all subsystems : @xmath58 and @xmath59 for all @xmath60 .",
    "if assumption [ ass.1 ] is fulfilled , then the following _ disturbance _ sets are compact for all @xmath4 @xmath61 moreover , if assumption [ ass.4 ] is fulfilled , the sets @xmath62 represent a suitable bound for the interaction between subsystems : @xmath63 in view of this and definition [ def.3 ] , for any linear feedback @xmath40 that renders @xmath64 schur , there exists a compact rpi set @xmath65 for the local disturbed dynamics @xmath66 given @xmath67 and the invariance of @xmath65 , it follows that @xmath68    [ prop.2 ] if for all @xmath4 ( i ) @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and ( ii ) @xmath67 , then @xmath58 and @xmath59 for all @xmath4 and for all @xmath71 .    in the context of tmpc , the sets @xmath65 are the cross section of the local tubes .",
    "proposition [ prop.2 ] provides a decentralized perspective to the problem of finding stabilizing and constraint admissible local linear feedbacks .",
    "indeed , as long as the hypotheses of proposition [ prop.2 ] are met ( for all @xmath4 ) , independent rpi sets could be designed for each subsystem .",
    "the closed - loop global system would then take the form @xmath42 , which as shown in example [ exmp.1 ] , could be unstable .",
    "this seems to defy the invariance properties of the collection of sets @xmath65 .    in spite of the local invariance arguments , the analysis of the local dynamics does evidence an unexpected behaviour .",
    "consider a network with @xmath72 and suppose that @xmath40 are indeed chosen such that @xmath64 are schur and that the hypotheses of proposition [ prop.2 ] are met , but @xmath73 is not schur .",
    "given @xmath74 and unstable closed - loop global dynamics , there must exist a @xmath75 such that , @xmath76 but @xmath77 .",
    "this means that the robust invariant property of @xmath78 has been broken , which can only mean that the disturbances affecting subsystem 1 ( see ) have been _ larger _ than initially assumed .",
    "a similar argument can be made for @xmath79 , which prompts the following conclusion :    [ prop.1 ] suppose @xmath40 are chosen such that @xmath64 are schur but @xmath73 is not , and that the hypotheses of proposition [ prop.2 ] are met .",
    "then there exists a finite time @xmath80 such that @xmath81 but @xmath82 or @xmath83 .",
    "[ rem.2 ] proposition [ prop.1 ] implies either a state _ jump _ from inside @xmath52 to outside @xmath84 , or an input _ jump _ from inside @xmath85 to outside @xmath86 .",
    "this , in some cases , might mean a discontinuity of the state trajectories , which is not characteristic of the type of ( linear ) systems being analysed .      the uncharacteristic behaviour made explicit by remark [ rem.2 ] can be explained by the fundamental relation that exists between assumption [ ass.2 ] and the notions of invariance employed in proposition [ prop.2 ] ( and by tmpc ) .",
    "consider the following definition :    [ def.2 ] a tube @xmath25 corresponding to a particular linear feedback @xmath40 is said to be constraint admissible if the first part of the hypothesis of proposition [ prop.2 ] holds , i.e. , if @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the main result of this paper is now stated :    [ thm.2 ] if there exists constraint admissible tubes for all subsystems @xmath4 , then the collection of local gains @xmath40 related to these admissible tubes fulfils assumption [ ass.2 ] .",

    "theorem [ thm.2 ] presents sufficient conditions for a collection locally stabilizing linear feedbacks to be globally stabilizing .",
    "unstable global dynamics , as demanded by proposition [ prop.1 ] , imply assumption [ ass.4 ] is not met , and therefore ( some of ) the disturbance sets are unbounded .",
    "the corresponding rpi sets are also unbounded , thus , the set inclusions required for constraint admissibility of the tubes can not be met .",
    "this implies that the behaviour described by remark [ rem.2 ] is not possible , because the tubes would not have been admissible .",
    "a collection of constraint admissible tubes @xmath65 is a family of jointly rpi sets .",
    "this collection forms what can be referred to as a _ square _ pi set , given that @xmath52 is defined by the cross product of subsets of the local dynamics state space .",
    "this is also pointed out in @xcite .",
    "[ rem.1 ] the existence of such a particular pi set is a necessary condition for the tubes to be system - wide admissible .",

    "large constraint sets for a single subsystem might render impossible to find admissible tubes for the affected neighbours .",
    "however , theorem [ thm.2 ] remains useful for the task of analysing local - to - global stabilizability ( the constraint sets could be shrunk , similar to the approach taken in @xcite ) .    in the parametrization of pifs proposed by @xcite , each element in the family of sets is also _",
