    "an orthogonal measurement ( _ i.e. , _ a von neumann measurement ) is one in which the measurement operators @xmath12 are mutually orthogonal projection operators .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimum measurement minimizing the probability of a detection error have been derived @xcite . however , except in some particular cases @xcite , obtaining a closed - form analytical expression for the optimal measurement directly from these conditions is a difficult and unsolved problem .",

    "@xcite use the principle of duality in vector space optimization to derive the same necessary and sufficient conditions . specifically , they show that the problem of finding the measurement that minimizes the probability of a detection error can be formulated as a generalized linear programming problem , with the positive orthant being replaced by the positive cone of psd matrices .",
    "although their approach leads to the same conditions derived by holevo @xcite , their apparent suggestion that this formulation produces a standard finite - dimensional linear programming problem is not correct , because the cone of psd matrices can not be described by a finite set of linear inequalities .    in this paper , we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal quantum measurement in a self - contained manner , again by exploiting duality arguments .",
    "the primary advantage of our formulation is that it readily lends itself to efficient computational methods .",
    "specifically , we show that the optimal measurement can be found by solving a standard convex semidefinite program with @xmath17 variables , followed by the solution of a set of linear equations or , at worst , a standard linear programming problem . by exploiting the many well - known algorithms for solving semidefinite programs @xcite",
    ", the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial time .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the iterative algorithm proposed by helstrom @xcite for solving the quantum detection problem , which is only guaranteed to converge to a local optimum , algorithms based on semidefinite programming are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum .",
    "after a statement of the problem in section  [ sec : qd ] , we derive in section  [ sec : sdp ] the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal measurement that minimizes the probability of a detection error , by formulating our problem as a semidefinite program .",
    "using this formulation , in section  [ sec : rone ] we prove that if the quantum state ensemble is a pure - state ensemble consisting of rank - one density operators @xmath18 , then the optimal measurement is a pure - state measurement consisting of rank - one measurement operators @xmath19 .",
    "this generalizes a previous result by kennedy @xcite , which establishes that for _ linearly independent _ vectors @xmath10 the optimal measurement is a ( necessarily orthogonal ) pure - state measurement . we also show that for a general quantum state ensemble , the rank of each optimal measurement operator @xmath12 is no larger than the rank of the corresponding density matrix @xmath8 . in section  [ sec : comp ]",
    "we consider efficient iterative algorithms that are guaranteed to converge to the globally optimum measurement .    throughout the paper we use the dirac bra - ket notation of quantum mechanics . in this notation ,",
    "the elements of @xmath3 are  ket \" vectors , denoted , _",
    "e.g. , _ by @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding  bra \" vector @xmath21 is the conjugate transpose of @xmath22 .",
    "the inner product of two vectors is a complex number denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "an outer product of two vectors such as @xmath24 is a rank - one matrix , which takes @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "assume that a quantum channel is prepared in a quantum state drawn from a collection of given states .",
    "the quantum states are represented by a set of @xmath0 psd hermitian density operators @xmath27 on an @xmath2-dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath3 . at the receiver ,",
    "a measurement is constructed , comprising @xmath0 psd hermitian measurement operators @xmath28 on @xmath3 .",
    "the problem is to choose the measurement operators to minimize the probability of detection error , _",
    "i.e. , _ the probability of incorrect detection of the transmitted state .",
    "we assume without loss of generality that the eigenvectors of the density operators @xmath27 span . ]",
    "@xmath3 . in this case , to constitute a measurement , the measurement operators @xmath12 must satisfy @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the identity operator on @xmath3 .",

    "@xcite . rather than relying on results that are scattered throughout the literature in various forms , in what follows we present a self - contained and direct derivation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal measurement .",
    "as we will see , this derivation also leads to efficient methods for computing the optimal measurement in cases in which an analytical solution is not known .    in the next section",
    "we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions on the measurement operators by formulating a _ dual problem_. the dual problem will also be used in section  [ sec : comp ] to develop efficient computational algorithms .",
    "our objective is to formulate a _ dual problem _ whose optimal value serves as a certificate for @xmath47 .",
    "specifically , we will formulate a minimization problem of the form @xmath49 for some linear functional @xmath50 such that for all feasible values of @xmath51 , _",
    "i.e. , _ values of @xmath51 that satisfy a certain set of constraints , and for any @xmath52 , we shall have @xmath53 . the dual problem",
    "therefore provides an upper bound on the optimal value of the original ( primal ) problem .",
    "in addition we would like the minimal value of @xmath50 , denoted @xmath54 , to be equal to @xmath47 .",
    "the equality @xmath55 will then lead to conditions of optimality on the measurement operators .",
    "furthermore , in this case , instead of solving the primal problem , we can find @xmath47 and the optimal measurement by solving the dual problem , which turns out to have far fewer decision variables .",
    "a general method for deriving a dual problem is to invoke the separating hyperplane theorem @xcite , which states that two disjoint convex sets is convex if for any @xmath56 , @xmath57 for all @xmath58 $ ] . ]",
    "can always be separated by a hyperplane .",
    "we will take one convex set to be the point @xmath15 , and then carefully construct another convex set that does not contain @xmath15 . this set will capture the equality constraints in the primal problem and the fact that for any primal feasible point , the value of the primal function is no larger than the optimal value .",
    "the dual variables will then emerge from the parameters of the separating hyperplane .    in our problem",
    "we have one equality constraint , @xmath59 , and we know that @xmath60 .",
    "our constructed convex set will accordingly consist of matrices of the form @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and scalars of the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "we thus consider the @xmath66-dimensional real vector space @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the reals , with inner product defined by @xmath69 note that since @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "we now define the subset @xmath72 of @xmath73 by @xmath74 it is easily verified that @xmath72 is convex , and @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , by the separating hyperplane theorem , there exists a _ nonzero _",
    "vector @xmath76 such that @xmath77 for all @xmath78 , _",
    "@xmath79 for all @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that @xmath82 , @xmath65 .",
    "it will turn out that the hyperplane parameters @xmath83 define the optimal dual point .",
    "we first show that these parameters have to satisfy certain constraints , which lead to the formulation of the dual problem .",
    "note that ( [ eq : hyperplane ] ) with @xmath84 , @xmath85 implies @xmath86 similarly , ( [ eq : hyperplane ] ) with @xmath87 , @xmath88 for @xmath89 , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is fixed and @xmath92 yields @xmath93 .",
    "since @xmath94 and @xmath95 are arbitrary , this implies @xmath96 with @xmath84 , @xmath97 , ( [ eq : hyperplane ] ) implies @xmath98 .",
    "if @xmath99 , then ( [ eq : z ] ) yields @xmath100 , and ( [ eq : a ] ) yields @xmath101 , which together means @xmath102 . however , this would contradict the assumption that @xmath103 .",

    "it was established that the conditions ( [ eq : op_cond1 ] ) and ( [ eq : op_cond2 ] ) together with ( [ eq : cond_pd ] ) and ( [ eq : cond_id ] ) are also sufficient . for completeness , we repeat the argument here .",

    "there are some particular cases in which an analytical solution to the quantum detection problem is known @xcite . in all of these cases ,",
    "when the density operators are rank - one operators , the optimal measurement also has rank one . in the special case",
    "in which the vectors @xmath10 are _ linearly independent _ , kennedy @xcite showed that the optimal measurement is always a rank - one measurement .",
    "however , this implication has not been proven in the general case . using the conditions for optimality we derived in the previous section",

    "we have seen that the optimal measurement operators @xmath122 can be determined by solving ( [ eq : op_cond ] ) , where @xmath123 is the optimal matrix that minimizes ( [ eq : min ] ) subject to ( [ eq : condx ] ) .",
    "thus the measurement operators @xmath122 must lie in the null space of @xmath155 , denoted @xmath156 , and consequently @xmath157 .",
    "since @xmath158 , it follows that @xmath123 is positive definite on @xmath3 .",

    "we therefore recover the statement by kennedy @xcite , that for a pure - state ensemble with linearly independent vectors , the optimal measurement is an orthogonal pure - state measurement .",
    "we summarize our results in the following theorem :    [ thm : rank1 ] let @xmath136 be a quantum state ensemble consisting of density operators @xmath8 with prior probabilities @xmath34 .",
    "then the optimal measurement consists of measurement operators @xmath28 with @xmath177 . in particular",
    "if @xmath178 is a pure - state quantum ensemble , then the optimal measurement is a pure - state measurement consisting of measurement operators of the form @xmath179 .",
    "in the general case there is no closed - form analytical solution to the maximization problem ( [ eq : max ] ) or the minimization problem ( [ eq : min ] ) .",
    "however , since ( [ eq : min ] ) is a convex optimization problem , there are very efficient methods for solving ( [ eq : min ] ) . in particular , the optimal matrix @xmath123 minimizing @xmath180 subject to ( [ eq : condx ] ) can be computed in matlab using the linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) toolbox .",
    "a convenient interface for using the lmi toolbox is the matlab package iqc@xmath181 .",
