    ", he introduced a simple lattice model exhibiting the quantum hall effect without landau levels , thereafter referred to as the _ anomalous _ qh effect . in his seminal work @xcite",
    ", haldane showed that quantum hall phases were rooted in the breaking of time - reversal symmetry , which potentially increased the possibilities to access this phenomenon in a wider range of two - dimensional systems .",
    "this first step played a major role in the quest for new topological states , as it paved the way for the generalization of the quantum hall effect .",
    "indeed , this work inspired studies aiming to discover topologically - ordered band structures in other spatial dimensions , and also , in physical systems satisfying time - reversal symmetry @xcite . this effort led to the prediction @xcite and to the discovery @xcite of @xmath2 topological insulators , which are materials featuring large spin - orbit coupling and exhibiting the quantum spin hall effect .",
    "in fact , the transport properties offered by these materials , which currently attract the scientific community for their potential future applications , can be described by simple lattice models that are direct generalizations of the initial haldane model @xcite .",
    "besides , it was recently shown that the haldane model could be tailored in order to create band structures presenting low - energy flat bands with non - zero chern numbers @xcite . in such configurations , in analogy with fractional quantum hall states occurring in strong magnetic fields , interactions can profoundly change the many - body ground state .",
    "this offers a novel route towards strongly - correlated topological liquids , the so - called _ fractional chern insulators _ @xcite .",
    "although it played a fundamental role in the search for topological materials , the haldane model was never reproduced in solid - state systems .",
    "recently , it was suggested that the _ anomalous _ qh effect could be realized and observed in hgmnte quantum wells @xcite , in silicene subjected to in - plane magnetic fields @xcite , in 2d organic topological insulators @xcite , and in cold - atom setups @xcite .",

    "the matrix elements are exponentially suppressed compared to the ones describing nearest - neighbors tunneling , and negligible for realistic experimental configurations .",
    "this sets a constraint on the class of models that can be realized in this way , as we will discuss later in the paper .",

    "first of all , we note that a particle making a loop around a unit cell of the checkerboard lattice with tunneling elements does not acquire any phase factor .",
    "this is a consequence of unitarity , which imposes that the laser coupling matrix elements for @xmath57 transitions [ see eq . ] and its reversed @xmath58 counterpart , are complex conjugates . because of the alternating pattern of @xmath57 and @xmath58 links [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) ] , the sign of the tunneling phases alternates when moving in a given direction , which indeed leads to the cancellation of the overall phase picked by a particle hopping around a unit cell of the checkerboard . starting from the site @xmath47 , and using eqs .",

    "a suitable choice of the relative phase @xmath63 , which we take to satisfy the relation @xmath64 , leads to on - site energies @xmath65 here @xmath66 denote the internal energies in free space , and @xmath67 .",

    "one thus applies three coupling lasers propagating along @xmath25 .",
    "the laser at frequency @xmath71 is chosen with a wavevector @xmath72 , and the lasers at frequencies @xmath73 with the opposite wavevector @xmath74 .",
    "if we neglect off - resonant transitions , the alternation of the wavevectors compensates the alternation of the sign of the tunneling phases , thereby leading to a non - zero ",
    "magnetic \" flux per plaquette that is uniform across the lattice .",
    "starting from the site @xmath47 , one obtains that the phase acquired along the closed path @xmath59 is @xmath75 where the parameter @xmath76 is interpreted as the uniform synthetic magnetic flux ( in units of the flux quantum ) penetrating each plaquette .",
    "thus , this scheme realizes the hofstadter model @xcite , generalizing the proposals @xcite to the case of the checkerboard geometry .",
    "this proposal can be generalized to non - abelian gauge potentials when @xmath0 and @xmath1 now represent manifolds of degenerate states ( see fig .",

    "therefore , this requires two superlattice potentials with period @xmath62 along the @xmath24 and @xmath25 axis , with different heights @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this generates nine different transition frequencies differing by @xmath97 , that can be grouped into two families .",

    "two specific configurations , leading to the analog of the haldane model @xcite , will be discussed below . in principle",
    ", arbitrary tunneling matrices can be generated in this way .",
    "however , the increase in complexity makes it experimentally very challenging . the configuration described above",

    "those frequencies are typically in the @xmath105khz range , much less than the absolute optical frequency @xmath106 corresponding to the bare atomic transition . as a result",

    "this represents nevertheless a significant technological challenge for designing arbitrary tunneling matrices .",
    "the idea that we expose in this section is to propose and analyze a mapping from the original haldane model , involving complex tunneling phases on a honeycomb lattice @xcite , into a spin-@xmath15 model defined on the square lattice , see figs .",

    "thus , the tight - binding hamiltonian describing nn hopping between @xmath110 and @xmath111 neighboring sites can be mapped into an equivalent operator , which involves hopping between opposite pseudo - spin components , which are located at neighboring sites of a square lattice , see fig . [ fig1 ] ( b ) .",

    "the haldane - like optical lattice described above is characterized by the following physical properties :    * a massless dirac - like spectrum for @xmath191 , * a massive dirac - like spectrum for small @xmath192 , * a largely gapped spectrum for @xmath193 , * chern insulating phases for @xmath147 .",
    "the dirac - like spectrum can be experimentally detected along the lines of the recent experiments @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the techniques developed in these experiments could identify the opening of the bulk gap in the vicinity of the dirac points , and thus , evaluate the amplitude of the mass terms @xmath194 .",
    "we point out that the detection of a dirac spectrum in our square optical lattice setup would already be an interesting signature of the non - trivial synthetic gauge potential @xcite .",
    "+ the large gap opened by the terms proportional to @xmath155 could be directly detected through in - situ imaging .",
    "indeed , this spectral gap directly manifests itself in the spatial density of the atomic cloud @xcite .",
    "we show the corresponding density for @xmath141 and @xmath195 in fig .",
    "[ figdensity ] , for a system trapped by an additional harmonic potential @xmath196 : the clear plateau depicted by the density when @xmath195 is a direct signature of the gap opening .",
    "+ the most efficient way to identify the formation of a chern insulating phase would be to detect the presence of robust and chiral edge modes , whose energies are located within the bulk gap discussed above .",
    "this could be performed by deforming the atomic cloud and imaging its time - evolving spatial density @xcite , or using light scattering methods @xcite . in principle , measuring the chern number @xmath8 could be performed through spin - resolved momentum density measurements @xcite , bloch oscillations @xcite or hybrid time - of - flight images @xcite .     and @xmath195 .",
    "the atoms are trapped by a harmonic potential @xmath196 , with @xmath197 and @xmath198 , and the lattice size is @xmath199 .",
    "the density was obtained by setting the fermi energy to the value @xmath200 ( corresponding to the maximum of the highest bulk band for @xmath141 ) . in this figure",

    "( b ) same as ( a ) for @xmath195 , but represented in the 2d plane @xmath186 .",
    "note the clear plateau for @xmath195 , which indicates the opening of a spectral gap @xcite.,width=336 ]",
    "the physics of the honeycomb haldane model can be alternatively studied by considering non - trivial hoppings on the @xmath170-flux model @xcite .",
    "the latter is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) and is characterized by tunneling amplitudes @xmath203 along alternate columns . in the absence of additional hoppings ,",
    "this system exhibits a gapless spectrum with two dirac cones , and it is therefore physically equivalent to the honeycomb lattice @xcite . in order to open a non - trivial topological gap , with chern number @xmath12 ,",
    "complex diagonal hoppings are required , see the purple arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) . as for the original honeycomb model discussed in the previous section ,",
    "these chiral and complex nnn hoppings highly diminish the feasibility of this haldane - like model with cold atoms trapped in optical lattices .",
    "note that the @xmath14flux model without nnn hoppings is equivalent to the hofstadter model with the magnetic flux set to @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "in this section , we follow the same strategy as before : we consider the two - component wave - function @xmath205 , which describes particles on alternate columns , see the blue ( @xmath110 ) and red ( @xmath111 ) sites in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( a ) . in these notations ,",
    "the single - particle schrdinger equation satisfied by @xmath206 in this model then takes the form @xmath207 where @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath125 and @xmath210 .",
    "therefore , the model is translated into a non - abelian square lattice , with direct tunneling operators @xmath211 , an onsite term @xmath130 , and two diagonal hopping matrices @xmath212 , see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( b ) .",
    "+        the @xmath14flux model can be analyzed in the same way as in the preceding section , with identical conclusions . in the limit @xmath141 ,",
    "the energy spectrum is given by @xmath213 with two independent dirac points at @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "in the vicinity of the dirac points , the effective masses are given by @xmath216 as a result , the chern number @xmath12 remains non - zero even without diagonal hoppings ( @xmath156 ) , as found previously .",
    "+ the @xmath14flux quantum hall model can thus be explored by realizing the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath217 in fact , this is the simplest scheme , exploiting non - abelian hopping operators on a square lattice , which leads to a topological ( chern ) insulating phase .",
    "indeed , the hopping operators @xmath129 should necessarily contain a term proportional to a pauli matrix , @xmath218 , in order to induce the dirac spectrum .",
    "then , an additional term @xmath219 should be added to at least one of these operators in order to open the topologically non - trivial gap .",
    "this minimal configuration is realized by the operators @xmath129 in eq . .",
    "+ from an experimental point of view , this scheme is significantly simpler to implement than the one previously exposed in section [ haldane ] , due to the fact that it features a laser - induced tunneling phase _ in the @xmath86 direction only _ , and thus , it does not require a superlattice along @xmath24 .",
    "this demands one @xmath180 coupling laser that drives tunneling along @xmath85 , another laser with polarization @xmath220 to drive the @xmath86 tunneling , and a pair of lasers driving @xmath170 transitions to generate the term @xmath221 with the proper relative phase ; each of these lasers should also have three  sidebands \" to drive all transitions introduced by the superlattice .",
    "this is not as complex as it seems at first sight , since the required sidebands can be generated by cascading modulators ( one generating sidebands corresponding to different zeeman transitions , and another one , corresponding to the different transitions introduced by the superlattice ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is fair to say that this represents an important technical challenge to realize this model experimentally .",
    "in conclusion , we have described an experimental scheme to generate non - abelian gauge potentials for cold atoms in a square optical lattice .",
    "the scheme generalizes the proposals of refs . @xcite",
    "originally formulated for alkali atoms , to two - electron atoms ( alkaline earth atoms , ytterbium , erbium , ... ) , and requires additional superlattice potentials to generate finite flux per elementary cell of the lattice @xcite .",
    "we have shown that such arrangements can be used to generate topological phases with non - zero chern number .",
    "we have detailed two examples of microscopic models exhibiting such phases , a first one based on an explicit mapping from the haldane honeycomb lattice to a multicomponent model defined on the square lattice with non - abelian tunneling operators , and a second one built directly on the square lattice ( the so - called  @xmath170-flux \" model ) .",
    "the latter model is slightly simpler , but its experimental implementation would still represent a considerable challenge due to the relatively large number of laser frequencies that need to be controlled precisely . as explained before , the different transition frequencies can be generated from a single laser using frequency modulators , a standard tool in optoelectronics . as a result , we believe that the experimental implementation is challenging but possible . besides the models described here , generating non - abelian gauge fields on a lattice , can simulate many different systems , including lattice - gauge - theory models @xcite and spin - orbit coupled gases @xcite , with complete freedom over the choice of the microscopic hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with raman - coupled bulk systems , for example , where the form of the spin - orbit coupling is constrained @xcite .",
    "we also stress that although the laser - coupled honeycomb lattice described in refs .",
    "@xcite should be easier to implement experimentally , it does not offer the versatility of the non - abelian optical lattices discussed in this work . as a result ,",
    "the system described in this paper has the potential to realize other kinds of topological insulating phases , such as , for instance , the @xmath2 topological insulators characterized by a topological invariant @xmath222 and exhibiting the quantum spin hall effect @xcite .
