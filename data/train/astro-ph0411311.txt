    "a fundamental goal of the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) mission is to gauge the history of star formation in the universe over the interval @xmath2 .",
    "this ( forthcoming ) analysis will depend on integrated fuv and nuv flux measurements for @xmath3 distant galaxies , anticipated upon completion of the galex imaging surveys .",
    "however , accurate interpretation of these data requires a comprehensive understanding of the possibly heterogeneous resolved uv source population amongst galaxies of diverse type . also , detailed rest - frame uv observations of nearby galaxies are critically needed as a benchmark for optical observations of galaxy morphology at high redshift . for these reasons",
    ", in addition to the intrinsic interest in bright , well - resolved targets , the galex nearby galaxy survey ( ngs : bianchi et al .",
    "2004a , b ) is being undertaken .",
    "we have obtained fuv and nuv galex ngs observations of m31 and m33 , covering the full extent of each galaxy .",
    "local group objects constitute an especially critical portion of the ngs sample , as our angular resolution affords separation of individual young stellar clusters from their neighbors and host environment .",
    "furthermore , these nearby targets provide an excellent opportunity to measure properties of the apparently diffuse uv emission , uncontaminated by embedded stellar clusters which ultimately generate the extended radiation field ( although some `` diffuse '' emission may also originate from faint , unresolved stars ) .    in this letter",
    ", we describe preliminary analysis of the galex m31 and m33 mosaics .",
    "we characterize the overall uv morphology and contrast the galex sources with corresponding ionized nebulae ( regions , shells , filaments , and diffuse gas ) . for reference ,",
    "keel ( 2000 ) provides a succinct review of previous uv investigations in m31 and m33 .",
    "we analyzed fuv ( 13501750   ) and nuv ( 17502750   ) imaging data from galex , plus pre - existing ground - based @xmath0 observations .",
    "for local group targets within the ngs , the galex mission plan calls for two integrations ( conducted during separate orbits ) , amounting to a total of @xmath4 3 ks per field .",
    "the imagery presented here represents most of the eventual m31/m33 database , but one pointing in m33 and a few in m31 remain to be observed for the second time .",
    "we note that fields probing some portions of andromeda s extreme outer hi disk and high - velocity cloud population ( thilker et al .",
    "2004 , braun et al . in prep )",
    "are not yet available .",
    "the tiling of m31 , which incorporates some coverage gaps , was dictated by the need to avoid bright stars .",
    "fifteen @xmath5 diameter fields were observed .",
    "central coordinates and total exposure times are given in table 1 .",
    "m33 has been surveyed in its entirety without any gaps , using one `` first - look '' exposure of the northern disk and a 7-pointing hexagonal mosaic centered on the galaxy .",
    "the majority of m33 lies within the central pointing of this mosaic .",
    "figures 1 and 2 present our galex ( fuv , nuv ) color - composite images of m31 and m33 .",

    "2001 ) . in m33",
    ", we used a burrell schmidt @xmath0 mosaic ( hoopes & walterbos 2000 ) covering all of the disk .",
    "we adopt distances of 770 and 840 kpc , respectively , to m31 and m33 ( m31 : freedman & madore 1990 , m33 : freedman , wilson , & madore 1991 ) .",
    "the @xmath6  fwhm galex psf corresponds to @xmath7 pc .",
    "rms flux sensitivity varies with position .",
    "typical 1@xmath8 limits are 6.6 and @xmath9 erg s@xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath10 for fuv and nuv , respectively , evaluated at the scale of the psf . expressed in terms of surface brightness , these limits correspond to 28.0(28.2 ) ab mag arcsec@xmath12 in fuv(nuv ) .",
    "this sensitivity is sufficent to detect substantial diffuse emission throughout both galaxies .",
    "figure 3 presents fuv , nuv , and fuv  nuv radial profiles for both galaxies . for m33",
    ", we also show a radial profile for diffuse @xmath0 emission .",
    "we have measured the median ( sky - background - subtracted ) surface brightness in concentric elliptical annuli to @xmath13 along the major axis for m31 and @xmath14 for m33 , stepping by 15 . a complete description of the procedure is given by bianchi et al .",
    "( this volume ) . in m31 , to the limit of our sensitivity , there is no well - defined `` edge '' of the stellar disk traced by the galex observations .",
    "at least out a galactocentric distance of 27 kpc , there is no significant downturn in the surface density of intermediate mass stars producing the observed uv radiation in m31 .",
    "this is interesting given the much more obvious limit to the extent of regions traced in @xmath0 imaging ( @xmath15 kpc ) .",
    "enhancements in the median surface brightness occur at radii dominated by andromeda s well - known 10 and 15 kpc arms . in m33 , at the disk s edge , we note that the uv emission drops off significantly slower than the median @xmath0 emission . furthermore , we see no evidence for a uv edge at 32 reported by buat ( 1994 ) , most likely a consequence of our improved sensitivity . on both fuv  nuv panels , we indicate bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) model colors for starbursts spanning a range in age , and three model colors appropriate for differing periods of continuous star formation .",
    "the plotted models are for solar metallicity .",
    "when interpreting the measured colors in relation to the starburst models , one may consider the age corresponding to the best matching model color as the age of the last major star formation episode . in both galaxies , the fuv ",
    "nuv color of the typical stellar population generally becomes bluer with increasing radius , however the magnitude of this effect is variable . in m33 ,",
    "the outward trend toward bluer uv color is slight and fuv  nuv remains remarkably constant over the majority of the galactocentric radii examined .",
    "this reflects the global extent of recent star formation in m33 .",
    "almost every locale within m33 has undergone a significant burst within the past @xmath16 myr .",
    "see bianchi et al .",
    "( this volume ) for similar analysis of m51 and m101 .",
    "the proximity of our local group targets provides an excellent opportunity for decomposition of the galex imaging data into discrete ( compact ) sources and diffuse emission , especially so for m33 due to its favorable inclination ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "as in the study of diffuse ionized gas ( dig , hoopes et al .",
    "2001 ) , the uv diffuse fraction ( defined as the integral of diffuse emission / integral of all emission ) can be used to consider issues of radiation transport in the ism .",
    "the uv diffuse fraction acts as a indicator for the origin and subsequent path of non - ionizing photons , whereas the @xmath0 diffuse fraction provides an indirect tracer of the lyman continuum .",
    "we measured the diffuse fraction ( in fuv , nuv , and @xmath0 ) as a function of radius in m33 using our galex data and the schmidt mosaic of greenawalt ( 1998 ) .",
    "this was accomplished by computing the average ratio of two images in elliptical annuli oriented to match the m33 disk .",
    "the first of these two images was a representation of the diffuse emission on 1.5 kpc scales , generated by applying a large circular median - filter to the data .",
    "the median operator effectively eliminated the flux from all discrete structures smaller than 1.5 kpc .",
    "the second image contributing to our measured ratio was a smoothed version of the original data , generated by convolving with a gaussian kernel sized to achieve resolution ( 1.5 kpc ) matching the median image described above .",
    "both these images were background subtracted before computation of the diffuse fraction . to verify the accuracy of our method in the uv , we compared with published work on the diffuse ionized gas .",
    "consistent with hoopes & walterbos ( 2000 ) , we find that the @xmath0 diffuse fraction is approximately 0.4 at radii hosting the bulk of m33 s emission line gas .",
    "we determined the uv diffuse fraction in m33 using both fuv and nuv images , but found the nuv estimate is notably contaminated ( in spots ) by foreground stars .",
    "accordingly , we adopt the fuv - band for gauging the uv diffuse fraction .",
    "figure 4 presents the uv and @xmath0 diffuse fractions measured for m33 .",
    "the ultraviolet diffuse fraction appears to be remarkably constant near 0.65 over a large range in galactocentric radius , with departures to higher values in circumnuclear regions and , most notably , at the limit of the @xmath0 disk .",
    "the increase in fuv diffuse fraction at large galactocentric radii may reflect that a substantial portion of the diffuse emission beyond this point is not generated in situ but rather scattered from dust , after originating in the vicinity of the disk s outermost regions .",
    "note that we have not attempted correction of the uv diffuse fraction for decreased extinction in the field away from compact star forming regions , but it is possible that the uv diffuse fraction could adjust substantially downward once this is considered ( buat et al .",
    "radial variation of the @xmath0 diffuse fraction was also measured .",
    "we found values generally near 0.4 but rising toward the galaxy center , up to 0.6 .",
    "the relative intensity of diffuse uv and @xmath0 emission and uv color in dig as a function of distance from associated stellar clusters is another useful probe of the ism .",
    "indeed , the ionization mechanism of the dig has long been a puzzle , as it requires a very large ( 30 - 50@xmath18 of the ionizing photons from a galaxy s ob stellar pop . ) , sustained energy source for the gas to remain ionized .",
    "if ob stars in cluster environments are responsible for the ionization , the lyman continuum photons must `` leak '' from regions .",
    "hoopes & walterbos ( 2000 ) first considered the contribution of field ob stars as an additional way to support the dig , finding that they can account for roughly 40% of the observed emission .",
    "our galex observations will soon be used to measure extinction corrected fuv / h@xmath1 and fuv  nuv within the dig , comparing fir , nir bands with our fuv image to gauge extinction ( thilker et al . in prep . ) .",
    "the galex fuv and nuv imagery of m31 and m33 allows for a detailed study of the relation between resolved emission line structures ( traced by @xmath0 ) and young stellar clusters ( and/or single massive stars ) .",
    "for this letter , we present an overview of the issue .",
    "figure 5 shows a color - composite image of @xmath0 + continuum ( red ) , continuum ( green ) , and galex nuv ( blue ) imagery for the whole of m33 , whereas fig .",
    "6 presents an analogous high - resolution view for a spiral arm segment in m31 .",
    "[ note that the full - quality figures of this paper are electronically available , and retain much more detail than in print . ]",
    "the galex imagery exhibits nearly one to one correlation with the distribution of regions ( as expected ) , but notably also shows uv bright clusters or star inside the vast majority of apparent @xmath0 bubbles . although @xmath0 is a very sensitive tracer of massive star formation , it reveals only those sources which are still very young .",
    "galex provides a more complete census of recent star formation as it traces young - to - moderate age stellar populations , up to several hundred myr , unless they are highly obscured .",
    "this conclusion is obvious from inspection of figs . 5 and 6 , and serves to highlight the most basic premise of the galex mission : to survey cosmic star formation history in the vacuum ultraviolet .",
