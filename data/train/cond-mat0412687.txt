    "molecules are usually treated as purely coulombic systems , while the strong interaction between their nuclear constituents is assumed to play a negligible role .",
    "however any coulombic molecular level lying above the lower threshold of the nuclear subsystem , is embedded in the continuous spectrum of the nuclear sub - hamiltonian .",
    "the coupling between the molecular and nuclear channels , hence , turns this level into a resonance ( see , e.  g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "of course , due to the wide coulombic barrier between the nuclei and the short - range character of the nuclear interaction , this coupling , and thus the width of the resonance , which determines the fusion probability of the nuclear constituents of the molecule , is in general extremely small .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , the situation may be rather different if the nuclear subsystem of a molecule has a sufficiently narrow near - threshold resonance .",
    "examples of such nuclear systems may be read off from the data presented in @xcite . among them",
    "are even customary systems like @xmath4o and @xmath5o  @xcite , i.e. , the nuclear constituents of the water molecule @xmath6 or the hydroxyl ion @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the isotope @xmath9o . for @xmath10 and @xmath6 the influence of near - threshold nuclear resonances on the molecular properties has been studied in @xcite by estimating the overlap integrals between the corresponding molecular and nuclear wave functions .",
    "the best known example of such phenomena is the muon catalyzed fusion of deuteron and triton in the @xmath11 molecule , where the near - threshold nuclear resonance @xmath12he@xmath13 plays a decisive role  @xcite .",
    "being motivated by the above special cases , we deal in the present work like in @xcite with a rather general model hamiltonian related to the ones considered by friedrichs in  @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian consists of a nuclear part , a molecular part with eigenvalues embedded in the continuous spectrum of the nuclear part , and a weak coupling term which turns these unperturbed eigenvalues into molecular resonances . since the model is explicitly solvable",
    ", the mechanism of formation of the resonances becomes clearly visible .",
    "the following property pointed out in  @xcite appears , in particular , as a general feature : if the nuclear channel itself has a narrow resonance with a position close to the molecular energy , then the width ( the imaginary part ) of the resulting molecular resonance is found to be inversely proportional to the nuclear width . in other words , a large increase of the decay rate of the molecular state , i.e. of the fusion probability , is observed in this case .",
    "such a coincidence of nuclear and molecular energies is , of course , a very rare phenomenon in nature .",
    "influence of the narrow pre - threshold resonances on the properties of infinite crystalline molecular structures was studied in @xcite . in the present work we concentrate on more realistic finite crystals .",
    "a goal of this work is to show that the decay rate of a molecular state with the energy close to a near - threshold resonance may be considerably enhanced when arranging molecular clusters within a finite crystalline structure .",
    "the reason is that in such a configuration the original discrete molecular energy turns into a set of energy levels .",
    "that is , even if the position of the nuclear resonance differs from the original molecular level , it can get within this set .",
    "this allows for a fine tuning by exciting the crystalline structure to energies as close as possible to the energy of the nuclear resonance .",
    "we show that the lattice states , which correspond to such an initial choice of their quasimomentum distribution , decay exponentially with a rate which is again inversely proportional to the width of the nuclear resonance .",
    "in this section we recall our main reasoning @xcite regarding an influence of a near - threshold nuclear resonance on the width of a molecular resonance in the case of a single molecule .",
    "let us consider a two - channel hilbert space @xmath14 consisting of a nuclear hilbert space @xmath15 ( channel 1 ) and a one - dimensional molecular space @xmath16 ( channel 2 ) .",
    "the elements of @xmath17 are represented as vectors @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is simply a complex number ) .",
    "the inner product @xmath22 in @xmath17 is naturally defined via the inner products @xmath23 in @xmath15 and @xmath24 in @xmath25 .    as a hamiltonian in @xmath17 we consider the @xmath26 operator matrix @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ( self - adjoint ) `` nuclear hamiltonian '' in @xmath15 , and @xmath29 a trial molecular energy .",
    "a vector @xmath30 provides the coupling between the channels .",
    "it should be mentioned that the hamiltonian  ( [ h2 ] ) resembles one of the well known friedrichs models  @xcite .    if there is no coupling between the channels , i.e. for @xmath31 , the spectrum of @xmath32 consists of the spectrum of @xmath28 and the additional eigenvalue @xmath33 .",
    "we assume that the continuous spectrum @xmath34 of the hamiltonian @xmath28 is not empty and that the eigenvalue @xmath33 is embedded in @xmath34 .",
    "it is also assumed that @xmath33 is not a threshold point of @xmath34 , and that this spectrum is absolutely continuous in a sufficiently wide neighborhood of @xmath33 .",
    "a nontrivial coupling @xmath35 between the channels will , in general , shift the eigenvalue @xmath33 into an unphysical sheet of the energy plane .",
    "the resulting perturbed energy appears as a resonance , i.e. , as a pole of the analytic ( or , more precisely , meromorphic ) continuation of the resolvent @xmath36 taken between suitable states ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in the present work",
    "we assume that such a continuation through the absolutely continuous spectrum of @xmath28 in some neighborhood of @xmath33 is possible at least for the matrix element @xmath37 of the resolvent @xmath38 .",
    "then , from the explicit representation for the resolvent @xmath39 @xcite , one can easily see that the operator - valued function @xmath40 admits meromorphic continuation to the same neighborhood , too .",
    "the poles of @xmath39 on the physical sheet are either due to zeros of the _ transfer function _",
    "( see @xcite ) @xmath41 or due to poles of the resolvent @xmath42 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter correspond to the discrete spectrum of the operator @xmath28 which may determine part of the point spectrum of @xmath32 .",
    "this is true , in particular , for the multiple eigenvalues of @xmath28 . in any case",
    "it is obvious that the perturbation of the eigenvalue @xmath33 only corresponds to solutions of the equation @xmath43 , i.e. , of @xmath44 this equation has no roots @xmath45 with @xmath46 on the physical sheet .",
    "therefore , being eigenvalues of the self - adjoint operator @xmath32 , they have to be real .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ h2res ] ) may have solutions only on the real axis and in the unphysical sheet(s ) of the riemann surface of the resolvent @xmath42 .",
    "we start with a brief discussion of the case where the nuclear channel hamiltonian @xmath28 generates no resonances close to @xmath33 in a domain @xmath47 of the unphysical sheet which ajoins the physical sheet from below the cut .",
    "this assumption implies that for a wide set of unit vectors @xmath48 the quadratic form @xmath49 can be analytically continued in @xmath47 . moreover , under certain smallness conditions for @xmath50 , eq .",
    "( [ h2res ] ) is uniquely solvable  @xcite in @xmath47 providing in the main order ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) @xmath51 the real and imaginary parts of the resonance @xmath52 , thus , are given by @xmath53      our main interest concerns the opposite case of a nuclear resonance @xmath54 , @xmath55 , with a real part @xmath56 close to @xmath33 . for the sake of simplicity we assume the corresponding pole of @xmath42 to be of first order .",
    "let the element @xmath30 be such that the function @xmath57 admits an analytic continuation into a domain @xmath47 which contains both points @xmath33 and @xmath58 .",
    "this domain , moreover , is assumed to belong to the unphysical sheet which adjoins the physical sheet along the upper rim of the cut . in @xmath47",
    "the function @xmath57 , thus , can be written as @xmath59 with @xmath60 being a holomorphic function . for a fixed `` structure function '' we have @xmath61 with a constant @xmath62 determined by the residue of @xmath42 at @xmath63 . note that this residue is usually expressed in terms of resonance ( gamow ) functions ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , we assume that the resonance corresponds to an `` almost eigenstate '' of @xmath28 . that is , in principle a limiting procedure @xmath64 is possible so that the resonance turns into a usual eigenvalue with an eigenvector @xmath65 more precisely , we assume @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "this can be achieved , e.g. , if the hamiltonian @xmath28 itself has a matrix representation of the form  ( [ h2 ] ) and the resonance @xmath58 is generated by a separated one - dimensional channel .",
    "in such a case we would have @xmath68 ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite , sec.ii ) .",
    "let @xmath69 and , for @xmath70 , @xmath71 with constants @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , the coupling between the channels in the hamiltonian  ( [ h2 ] ) is assumed to be so weak that @xmath74 itself is very small .    after inserting  ( [ betarepres ] ) for @xmath57 , eq .",

    "in case of the sign `` @xmath77 '' we denote the root of  ( [ h2roots ] ) by @xmath78 , in case of the sign `` @xmath79 '' by @xmath80 .    according to @xcite and @xcite , the roots @xmath78 and @xmath80 of  ( [ h2roots ] )",
    "are essentially given by @xmath81 from the second condition  ( [ h2conditions ] ) follows @xmath82 .",
    "consequently , this term provides in @xmath78 a very small perturbation of the initial nuclear resonance @xmath58 .",
    "as compared to @xmath83 it represents also in @xmath80 a very weak perturbation of the molecular energy @xmath33 .",
    "however , as compared to the result  ( [ h2resonance ] ) , valid in case of a missing nearby nuclear resonance , it can be rather large .",
    "in particular , if the molecular energy @xmath33 coincides with the real part @xmath56 of the nuclear resonance @xmath58 , then @xmath84 with @xmath85 _ the width of the molecular resonance @xmath80 in the presence of a nearby nuclear resonance @xmath58 , thus , turns out to be inversely proportional to the nuclear width @xmath83_.    the second inequality  ( [ h2conditions ] ) , chosen as a condition for @xmath50 reflects the fact that the `` usual '' molecular width @xmath86 is much smaller than the width of a usual nuclear resonance @xmath83 , @xmath87 this can practically always be assumed for concrete molecules .    under condition  ( [ alimit ] )",
    "the value of @xmath88 differs from zero , @xmath89 , as @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , in the presence of a narrow ( @xmath90 ) nuclear resonance close to @xmath33 the molecular width @xmath0 is much larger than the molecular width @xmath86 observed in absence of such a resonance .",
    "in fact , this ratio is determined by the large quotient @xmath91 .",

    "such a choice of the interaction corresponds to the natural assumption that the cells interact between each other via the molecular states , while the direct interaction between nuclear constituents belonging to different cells is negligible .",
    "we assume that the closed interval is totally embedded in the continuous spectrum @xmath34 of @xmath28 and , moreover , that no thresholds of @xmath34 belong to this interval .",
