    "the measurement of the higgs absolute branching ratios to all possible species is an important part of the ilc program , giving a precision test of the standard model prediction that the higgs boson couples to each particle in proportion to its mass  @xcite .",
    "these measurements also discriminate between different ` beyond the sm ' scenarios  @xcite .",
    "this study considers the higgs decay mode to charm quarks which results in two- and four - jet final states .",
    "the expected sm higgs boson branching ratio to charm quarks is equal to 3.09% for @xmath1 = 120 gev and one of the main difficulties of the analysis is to separate this signal from the background of higgs decays to b - quarks which has substantially larger br of 67.92% .",
    "the selected decay modes exercise the tagging of charm quarks which is particularly sensitive to the vertex detector performance  @xcite .",
    "the signal events comprise of higgs bosons decaying into charm quarks produced in higgs - strahlung , @xmath2 zh ignoring other contributing processes .",
    "the cp - even higgs can also be produced via ww(zz)-fusion processes , @xmath3h ) as shown in figure  [ fig : higgsprod ] .        at low centre of mass energies",
    "the higgs - strahlung process is dominant if @xmath4 due to phase space considerations .",
    "the production cross - section is shown in figure  [ fig : zhxsec ]  @xcite . at larger cm energies ( @xmath5 500 gev )",
    "the fusion processes start to dominate over the zh process .",
    "the zz - fusion process is suppressed by one order of magnitude compared to ww - fusion due to the ratio between neural and charged currents  @xcite .",
    "both the signal and background events are produced at the centre of mass energy @xmath6  gev , total integrated luminosity of 250  fb@xmath7 and the higgs boson is assumed to have mass 120 gev .",
    "the choice of energy in this analysis maximizes the cross - section value for higgs - strahlung .",
    "standard model events ( mainly ww , zz and qq pairs ) and higgs decays to other fermions other than charm quarks are considered as backgrounds .",
    "all 0 , 2 and 4 fermion final states were generated using the whizard monte carlo event generator  @xcite .",
    "pythia  @xcite was used for the final state qed and qcd parton showering , fragmentation and decay to provide final - state observable particles .",
    "photons from beamstrahlung and initial state radiation were also included in the simulations .     processes ( dotted lines ) for a 120 - 200 gev sm higgs as a function of the centre - of - mass energy ]    for this study ,",
    "event samples are created conforming to the expected ilc baseline parameters of @xmath880% electron and @xmath930% positron polarization .",
    "about 7 m events were processed through the full detector simulation , with individual events weighted to reflect the statistical sampling .",
    "the detector response to generated events is simulated using the geant4 toolkit  @xcite , which provides the necessary classes to describe the geometry of the detector , the transport and interaction of particles with materials and fields . a thin layer of linear collider specific code , slic  @xcite , provides access to the monte carlo events , the detector geometry and the output of the detector hits .",
    "the detector parameters can be varied without having to rebuild the simulation executable binaries since the geometries are fully described at runtime .",
    "the output is in the standard lcio format  @xcite so that detectors using other simulation packages can be analyzed and data generated using this system can be analyzed in other analysis frameworks .",
    "this analysis uses the silicon detector ( sid02 ) model developed by the silicon detector ( sid ) design study  @xcite .",
    "the tracking , electromagnetic calorimetry , highly segmented hadronic calorimetry using pfa ( particle flow algorithm ) and vertex detector are all silicon based .",
    "the sid also incorporates a high field solenoid , iron flux return , and a muon identification system .",
    "the vertex detector ( vd ) is especially important for this analysis since it relies on flavour tagging based on the lifetime information of decaying particles .",
    "the vd comprises of a central barrel system with 5 silicon pixel layers and forward and backward disk regions each with 4 pixel disks .",
    "it is enclosed within a double walled carbon fibre support .",
    "the pixels are 20 @xmath10 and the sensor thickness is taken to be 75@xmath11 m .",
    "sensor cut width is 8.68 mm in the innermost layer and 12.58 mm in all other layers .",
    "the sensor cut length is 125 mm for all layers .",
    "carbon fibre cylinders support the sensors and the vertex detector is attached to the support tube with 25% material coverage support disks . for sid , the charged track momentum resolution is expected to be better than @xmath12 for high momentum tracks and the impact parameter resolution will be better than @xmath13 ) [ @xmath11 m ] . the overall material budget for the vd per layer is 0.15% of the radiation length ( x@xmath14 )",
    ". detailed geometry description of the detector is available at .",
    "identification of jets is an importand part of this analysis .",
    "the fragmentation products of hadronic systems are forced in n jets .",
    "the durham algorithm  @xcite is used in the analysis and provides y - cut values that determine the separation between 1 and 2 jet cases and generally between n-1 and n jet cases .    to provide the most probable kinematic configuration of the event topology a kinematic",
    "fitter ( marlin kinfit  @xcite ) with four - momenta and mass constraints is used . the fitter uses the method of lagrange multipliers to determine the most probable value for the jet four - momentum .    in order to identify primary , secondary and tertiary vertices",
    "the topological vertex finder zvtop is used .",
    "the algorithm is part of a vertexing package developed by the lcfi collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it classifies events on the number of found vertices and combines eight optimized variables for each type of event in a neural network , which is then separately trained on samples of b- , c- and light quarks .",
    "the best discriminating variables are the corrected vertex mass , secondary vertex probability , impact parameter significance of the most significant track and the number of vertices in the event .",
    "there are nine networks used with eight inputs , one hidden layer with 14 neurons and one output neuron .",
    "figure  [ fig : effpur ] shows the performance of the lcfi package optimized for the sid detector .",
    "the plot shows the dependence of the purity on efficiency for the di - jet sample at @xmath15 = 500 gev for b - tagging , c - tagging and c - tagging with b - only background .",
    "the samples used for training of neural networks pass through the full sid simulation and reconstruction .",
    "the open source fast artificial neural network ( fann ) package  @xcite is used to provide neural networks for the final event selection . the package is written in c programming language called from within a c++ wrapper .",
    "the analysis signature is dependent on the z boson decay products ( charged leptons , hadrons or neutrinos ) .",
    "the channels studied in this analysis are the neutrino mode ( z decaying to neutrinos ) and the hadronic mode ( z decaying to hadrons ) .",
    "the selection of signal events is performed in three stages .",
    "the first step involves the classification of events into two channels using the number of leptons and visible energy in the event .",
    "visible energy is defined as the sum of energies of all reconstructed particles in the event .",
    "leptons are defined as reconstructed electrons or muons with momentum larger than @xmath1615 gev .",
    "figure  [ fig : enlep ] shows the distributions of the visible energy and the number of leptons for the signal ( filled histogram ) , higgs background ( dashed line ) and sm background ( solid line ) before any selections .",
    "the neutrino mode is selected as events with no leptons and with visible energy in the @xmath16 90 to 160 gev interval .",
    "the hadronic mode is selected as events with no leptons and the visible energy above 170 gev .",
    "the second step is a cut based selection which reduces the backgrounds in the selected channel followed by a final stage using two neural network ( nn ) discriminants trained on signal and two types of background samples , sm and higgs .",
    "the remaining events after the nn selection are used for the calculation of the cross sections and branching ratios .      in this channel",
    "all reconstructed particles are clustered into two jets which , for the signal , are assumed to come from the higgs boson recoiling against two neutrinos from the z boson decay .",
    "the discrimination between the signal and background with a different number of jets is achieved by selection of the @xmath17 parameter .",
    "it corresponds to the minimum y - parameter for the two jet hypothesis in the durham algorithm .",
    "the y - parameter is defined as follows :",
    "1 .   given all pairs of particles",
    "@xmath18 calculate @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the sum of the visible energies of all particles before any recombination .",
    "2 .   if all @xmath21 @xmath22 y - parameter stop calculation .",
    "the number of jets in the event is then defined as equal to the number of particles left .",
    "3 .   otherwise recombine the pair with the smallest @xmath21 into a single particle .",
    "4 .   finally , go back to step 1 .    therefore , in this channel the @xmath17 parameter is defined as the minimum value of the y - parameter that leads to a 2-jet event .",
    "another powerful discriminant , the reconstructed invariant mass of two hadronic jets , is expected to be consistent with the higgs mass .    figure  [ fig : nu ] shows distributions of various variables used for pre - selection for the signal and backgrounds after classification .",
    "the kinematic variables used are :    * transverse momentum of jet , @xmath23 : the majority of sm background events are soft compared to signal events .",
    "the signal peak is expected to be at @xmath24 .",
    "* @xmath25 per jet : require more than 4 charged tracks to reject purely leptonic events * @xmath26 ) : this variable is used to exclude fully hadronic ww ( and zz ) events which are 4-jet events mis - identified as 2-jet events .",
    "the @xmath26 ) value is larger for the backgrounds compared to the signal . *",
    "thrust : this is the maximum directed momentum given by @xmath27 signal events are less boosted and are more spherical than the background events .",
    "* @xmath28@xmath29@xmath28 : signal events are produced more centrally in the detector while majority of the background processes have a strongly forward peaking angular distribution . *",
    "angle between jets : a large fraction of background events have back - to - back jets but there also backgrounds with low angular separation due to low boost .",
    "signal events are confined are confined to a range of angular values due to constraints coming from z and h production . *",
    "di - jet invariant mass : the signal di - jet mass is required to be between 100 and 140 gev to reject low mass hadronic systems from ww , zz and two - photon events * highest reconstructed photon energy : the signal events rarely have hard photons and this helps reject both highly energetic initial state radiation ( isr ) photons and hard photons from di - jet events which occur for the background . no photon isolation is required .",

    "+   +    .selections for the neutrino channel [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     using equation 5 the uncertainty on the branching ratio is found to be 8.4% .",
    "the uncertainty of the measurement of the decay branching ratio to charm quarks for a neutral sm higgs boson of mass 120 gev has been studied at a centre - of - mass of energy of @xmath15 = 250 gev and a total integrated luminosity of 250@xmath30fb@xmath7 .",
    "the analysis is based on full detector simulation and realistic event reconstruction .",
    "the relative uncertainties obtained are comparable to values obtained in some of the previous studies .",
    "a good performance of flavour tagging and the use of neural networks in event selection are critical in obtaining these results . in this study",
