    "to understand the evolution and internal structure of luminous and dark matter in early - type galaxies ( e / s0 ) , we have started the _ lenses structure and dynamics _ ( lsd ) survey . from an observational point of view",
    ", the lsd survey aims at measuring  using the keck - ii telescope  the internal ( stellar ) kinematics of a relatively large sample of e / s0 gravitational - lens galaxies in the redshift range @xmath24 ( see treu & koopmans 2002 , hereafter tk02 , for a description of the survey and its scientific rationale ) .",
    "the stellar kinematic profiles are combined with constraints from a gravitational - lensing analysis  in particular the mass enclosed within the einstein radius  in order to break degeneracies inherent to each method individually . in this way , we are uniquely able to constrain the luminous and dark mass distribution and the velocity ellipsoid of the luminous ( i.e. stellar ) component .",
    "several of the main questions about e / s0 galaxies that we aim to answer with the lsd survey are : ( i ) what is the amount of dark matter within the inner few effective radii ( @xmath4 ) ?",
    "( ii ) does the dark matter density profile agree with the universal profiles inferred from cdm simulations ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ; moore et al .",
    "1998 ; ghigna et al .",
    "2001 ) ? ( iii ) is there a universal total ( luminous plus dark - matter ) density distribution that well describes the inner regions of e / s0 galaxies ?",
    "if so , is it isothermal , as observed in the local universe and often assumed in lensing analyses ? ( iv ) how does the stellar mass - to - light ratio of e / s0 galaxies evolve with redshift , and does it agree with the evolution of the stellar populations of field early - type galaxies as inferred from fundamental plane ( hereafter fp ) measurements ( treu et al .  1999 , 2001a , 2002 ,",
    "hereafter t99 , t01a , t02 ; kochanek et al .",
    "2000 ; van dokkum et al.2001 ) ? ( v ) does the structure of e / s0 galaxies evolve between @xmath6 and 1 , or is the evolution of the fp purely an evolution of the stellar population ?",
    "( vi ) is the stellar velocity dispersion tensor isotropic or anisotropic ?",
    "first results from the lsd survey were presented in two recent papers ( koopmans & treu 2002 , hereafter kt02 ; tk02 ) , where we combined our measurement of the luminosity - weighted stellar velocity dispersion of the lens galaxy in mg2016 + 112 at @xmath25 with the mass enclosed by the einstein radius as determined from gravitational lens models ( koopmans et al .",
    "a robust constraint was found on the slope of the total density profile of the lens galaxy , i.e. @xmath26 ( random / systematic errors ) for @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , we were able to determine the stellar mass - to - light ratio and constrain the slope of the dark - matter halo , leading to a relatively simple self - consistent picture of the lens galaxy : an old and metal - rich stellar component embedded in a logarithmic ( i.e.  isothermal ) potential observed at a look - back time of @xmath27 gyrs  remarkably similar to many present - day e / s0 galaxies .",
    "constant m / l models were ruled out at a very high confidence level and a significant mass fraction ( @xmath2875% ) of dark matter was shown to be present inside the einstein radius of about 13.7  kpc . unfortunately , given the faintness of the galaxy at @xmath1=1 , only a luminosity - weighted velocity dispersion could be obtained and only minimal constraints could be set on the anisotropy of stellar orbits .    in this paper , we present keck and hst observations , a gravitational - lens model , and a dynamical model of the lens galaxy in 0047@xmath0281 at @xmath7 ( warren et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "this galaxy is bright and sufficiently extended that we were able to measure a spatially resolved velocity dispersion profile , thus setting unprecedented constraints on the orbital structure of a galaxy at a look - back time of @xmath29  gyrs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we describe archival hst observations and spectroscopic observations with esi on the keck ",
    "ii telescope . in section 3 ,",
    "we analyze these observations and determine the luminosity evolution of the lens galaxy with respect to the local fundamental plane . in section  4 , we present a gravitational lens model from which we determine the mass enclosed by the einstein radius . in section  5 ,",
    "we present a model for the luminous and dark - matter distributions of the lens galaxy . in section  6 ,",
    "the results from the dynamical models are presented .",
    "section  7 summarizes and discusses the results .    in the following , we assume that the hubble constant , the matter density , and the cosmological constant are h@xmath30  kms@xmath31mpc@xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively . throughout this paper",
    ", @xmath34 is the radial coordinate in 3-d space , while @xmath35 is the radial coordinate in 2-d projected space .",
    "wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images of the system are available from the hst archive , through filters f555w and f814w . in particular",
    ", the system has been imaged for 9500s in f555w on the wide - field camera , and 2700s in f814w on the planetary camera .",
    "the images were reduced using a series of iraf scripts based on the iraf package drizzle ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) , to align the independent pointings and perform cosmic ray rejection . a subsampled ( pixel scale @xmath36 )",
    "image was produced for the f555w image .",
    "the final `` drizzled '' image in f555w is shown in fig.[fig : hst ] .",
    "note that for the redshift of the source , @xmath37 , ly-@xmath38 is redshifted to 5589    ( warren et al.1998 ) and the f555w magnitude therefore includes the bright ly-@xmath38 emission .",
    "the f814w image is significantly shallower than the f555w image and although adequate for measuring the structural parameters , it is not particularly useful for the lens modeling , since the multiple images are faint and their positions can not be accurately determined .",
    "surface photometry was performed on the f555w and f814w images as described in t99 and treu et al .",
    "( 2001b ; hereafter t01b ) .",
    "the galaxy brightness profiles are well represented by an @xmath39  profile , which we fit  taking the hst point spread function into account  to obtain the effective radius ( @xmath4 ) , the effective surface brightness ( sb@xmath40 ) , and the total magnitude .",
    "the relevant observational quantities of galaxy g in 0047@xmath0281 and their errors are listed in table  1 .",
    "note that errors on sb@xmath40 and @xmath4 are tightly correlated and that the uncertainty on the combination @xmath41 that enters the fundamental plane ( see section  [ sec : fp ] ) is very small ( @xmath42 ; see kelson et al .",

    "we observed 0047@xmath0281 using the echelle spectrograph and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al .",
    "2002 ) on the w.m .",
    "keck  ii telescope during four consecutive nights ( 2326 july , 2001 ) , for a total integration time of 20,700s ( 7x1800s+3x2700s ) .",
    "the seeing was good ( @xmath43fwhm@xmath44 ) and three out of four nights were photometric .",
    "between each exposure , we dithered along the slit to allow for a better removal of sky residuals in the red end of the spectrum .",
    "the slit ( 20@xmath45 in length ) was aligned with the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "the slit width of @xmath46 yields an instrumental resolution of 30km@xmath3  which is adequate for measuring the stellar velocity dispersion and removing narrow sky emission lines .",
    "the centering of the galaxy in the slit was constantly monitored by means of the esi viewing camera ( the galaxy was bright enough to be visible in a few seconds exposure ) and we estimate the centering perpendicular to the slit to be accurate to @xmath47 .

    "tab : lensimages ]    the centroids of the four lensed images are used as constraints on the lens model ( table  3 ) , assuming errors of 10  mas , i.e. a fifth of a drizzled pixel size .",
    "we do not use the flux ratios in our analysis since they are not only difficult to measure accurately for extended images , but also change as function of position along the arcs and could be affected by differential dust extinction ( e.g. surpi & blandford 2002 ) . the position and position angle of the lens - galaxy mass distribution",
    "are set equal to those of its surface brightness distribution ( table  1 ) and the presence of an external shear is allowed for .",
    "hence , there are six free parameters ( i.e. the ellipticity and velocity dispersion of the lens - galaxy mass distribution , the source position , and the external shear ) , eight constraints ( i.e. the four image positions ) and consequently two degrees of freedom .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the sie mass model is defined such that the mass enclosed by the critical curve is equal to that inside the einstein radius of a singular isothermal sphere with the same velocity dispersion ( kormann et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the best solution for a single sie mass distribution yields @xmath48  km@xmath3  for the lens galaxy , whereas the required external shear is 0.13 .",
    "the @xmath49 is rather high , 306 for two degrees of freedom .",
    "it is possible to device more elaborate models ( for example with a dwarf companion ) that fit the observational constraints much better .",
    "however  as mentioned before ",
    "the mass enclosed by the einstein radius is very insensitive to the precise lensing model . as an illustration of the uncertainty related to the mass modeling we considered including a dwarf companion galaxy with @xmath50 km@xmath3 . although the fit is greatly improved ( @xmath51 because there are more free parameters than constraints ) , the velocity dispersion of the primary lens changes by only @xmath04km@xmath3 .",
    "we will therefore not elaborate further on the details of the lens model  which is not the intention of this paper  and use the results from sie mass model in the rest of the analysis .",
    "more detailed lens models are being constructed based on the structure in the lensed arcs ( r.  webster , private communication ) .",
    "we note that @xmath52 is close to the central stellar velocity dispersion ( table  1 ) .",
    "however , we emphasize that @xmath53 is a model - dependent expression of the well - determined total enclosed mass , while the central stellar velocity dispersion depends on the precise total mass profile , on the luminous mass profile , and on the dynamical state of the luminous component . hence",
    ", the two quantities do not have to agree in principle .",
    "their agreement is rather an indication of a regular behavior in the physical properties of early - type galaxies , as discussed in sections 5 , 6 and 7 ( see also kochanek 1994 and kochanek et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the adopted sie velocity dispersion corresponds to a circular einstein radius of @xmath54  kpc ( i.e. @xmath55 ) and an enclosed mass of @xmath56  m@xmath12 .",
    "the errors on @xmath15 and @xmath57 are correlated ( both depend on @xmath52 ) : for fixed @xmath15 one finds that @xmath58 .",
    "this error corresponds to about 3% for @xmath59  km@xmath3 , i.e. the difference between the model with and without an additional companion galaxy , which we adopt as systematic error ( the random error on @xmath52 is a negligible 0.5% ) . by adopting a wide range of mass profiles and/or ellipticities the enclosed mass changes by @xmath60 for symmetric four - image systems like 0047@xmath0281 ( e.g. kochanek 1991 ) .",
    "hence , adding the two contributions in quadrature , the total error becomes 5% on @xmath57 inside a radius of @xmath61  kpc .",
    "following tk02 , we model the galaxy mass distribution as a superposition of two spherical components , one for the luminous stellar matter and one for the dark - matter halo like 0047 - 281 ( e.  g. saglia , bertin & stiavelli 1992 ; kronawitter et al .",
    "2000 ) , even though clearly they are not appropriate for the lensing analysis , since , e.  g. , they do not produce quadruply lensed images . ] .",
    "the luminous mass distribution is described by a hernquist ( 1990 ) model @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total stellar mass .",
    "this profile well reproduces the @xmath39surface brightness profile for @xmath64 . in sec.[sec : slope ] , we also examine the effect of a steeper inner core , @xmath65 , using the jaffe ( 1983 ) model .",
    "we find the effect to be negligible within the errors .",
    "the dark - matter distribution is modeled as @xmath66 which closely describes a nfw profile for @xmath67 , and has the typical asymptotic behavior at large radii found from numerical simulations of dark matter halos @xmath68 ( e.g. ghigna et al.2000 ) .",
    "see tk02 for further discussion of this mass profile and dynamical model .    according to the cdm simulations given in bullock et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , a galaxy with the virial mass of galaxy g at @xmath7 has @xmath69  kpc  @xmath70 .",
    "hence , in the light of a comparison with cdm models , we can safely assume that the dark matter profile in the region of interest ( i.e.  inside @xmath71 ) is well described by a power - law @xmath72 . throughout this study",
    ", we will set @xmath73  kpc ( effectively equal to @xmath74 ) .",
    "the effects of changing @xmath75 are discussed in tk02 .",
    "in addition , we assume an osipkov - merritt ( osipkov 1979 ; merritt 1985a , b ) parametrization of the anisotropy @xmath76 of the luminous mass distribution @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the tangential and radial component of the velocity dispersion and @xmath80 is called the anisotropy radius . note that @xmath81 by definition , not allowing tangentially anisotropic models . a brief discussion of tangentially anisotropic models with negative constant values of @xmath76 is given in sec.6.2 .",
    "as a further caveat , note that at infinite radii , osipkov - merrit models become completely radial .",
    "although this behavior is not commonly found within the inner regions of e / s0 probed by observations ( e.  g. gerhard et al .",
    "2001 ; but see van albada 1982 and bertin & stiavelli 1993 for theoretical grounds ) , it has little impact in the case considered here , since the pressure tensor only becomes significantly radial well outside the einstein radius and in projection is significantly down - weighted by the rapidly falling luminosity  density profile .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion is obtained solving the three dimensional spherical jeans equation ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 eq .",
    "4 - 30 ) for the luminous component in the total gravitational potential and computing the luminosity - weighted average along the line of sight ( binney & tremaine 1987 ; eq .",
    "4 - 60 ; see also , e.  g. ciotti , lanzoni & renzini 1996 ) .",
    "we correct for the average seeing of 0.7@xmath45 , during the observations , and average the velocity dispersion  weighted by the surface brightness  inside the appropriate rectangular apertures . for completeness , we rescale the apertures ( table  2 ) by 0.9 and 1.1 in the directions of the major and minor axes , respectively , such that their projection on the axisymmetric model is equivalent to their projection on an elliptical galaxy with an axial ratio of 0.8 , even though this has minimal effects on the model velocity dispersions ( @xmath82% ) , much smaller than the observational errors . the uncertainties on seeing , aperture size , and galaxy centering are taken into account as systematic errors in the following discussion .",
    "the unknown parameters of our dynamical model are @xmath63 , @xmath83 , @xmath80 and @xmath84 ( we note again that @xmath85 and @xmath73  kpc )",
    ". we can eliminate one of these parameters using @xmath86 , the mass inside the einstein radius , which is the most accurately known constraint on the lens mass model .",
    "we choose to eliminate @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , we transform @xmath63 into the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath87 , fixing the model luminosity exactly to the value @xmath88@xmath89l@xmath90 .",
    "hence , values of @xmath87 that we derive from the dynamical model , bears an additional uncertainty of 11% , i.e. the observational error on @xmath91 , whereas @xmath63 , which is used in the model calculation , does not have this error .",
    "we use the average @xmath92  kpc of the rest - frame v and b  band values .    for",
    "any given set @xmath93 the dynamical model is completely determined and the luminosity - weighted velocity dispersions for each of the three apertures ( tab .  2 ) can be computed .",
    "the likelihood is determined assuming gaussian error distributions and the confidence contours using the likelihood ratio statistic only asymptotically , hence the interpretation of the likelihood ratio contours as confidence contours is an approximation . however , because the confidence contours ( i.e. fig.5 ) on which we base our results only mildly deviate from true ellipses  i.e. the limiting case for large numbers of constraints  , this approximation should work well . ] .      before studying the luminous and dark - matter profiles individually ,",
    "we determine the effective slope ( @xmath94 ) of the total ( luminous _ plus _ dark ) matter density profile ( @xmath95 ) inside the einstein radius . we emphasize that an effective slope of @xmath94 does not imply that the density profile follows @xmath16 exactly , but only _",
    "effectively_.    for mg2016 + 112 ( tk02 ) we measured an effective slope @xmath96 ( random and systematic errors ) , assuming @xmath16 .",
    "based on the data in warren et al.(1998 ) and kochanek et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we found a similar effective slope for 0047@xmath0281 .",
    "however , the errors were relatively large due to a lack of an extended kinematic profile and the large uncertainty on the velocity dispersion given by warren et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . with the data presented here we can perform a more accurate measurement , and set constraints on the anisotropy of the velocity ellipsoid .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhplot](c ) , we show the likelihood contours of @xmath94 versus the anisotropy radius @xmath80 , based on our extended kinematic profile of 0047@xmath0281 .",
    "three main conclusions can be drawn : ( i ) for a spherical isotropic stellar distribution function ( @xmath97 ) @xmath98 ( 68% cl ) ( see also fig.[fig : dispersion ] ) ; ( ii ) a lower limit of @xmath99 ( 68% cl ) can be set , implying that the velocity distribution function is isotropic in the inner regions of the galaxy ; ( iii ) independent of @xmath80 , one finds @xmath17 ( 68% cl ) .    to assess systematic errors on @xmath94",
    ", we varied @xmath57 and @xmath100 by the total uncertainties @xmath1015% and @xmath10110% , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath94 , required to fit the data , changes by @xmath1010.05 and @xmath1010.03 , respectively .",
    "other potential sources of errors , such as seeing , aperture corrections , aperture offsets , etc . , were found to be negligible .",
    "we add both contributions and we conservatively round up to a total systematic error of  @xmath1010.1 , to account for all potential minor sources of error .",
    "although the outer region of galaxy g is well fit by a hernquist ( 1990 ) model , the inner region with @xmath102 is less constrained due to the finite resolution of the hst images .",
    "we therefore examined power - law models with steeper inner luminosity density profiles , @xmath65 , using the model from jaffe ( 1983 ) . for both @xmath103 and @xmath104",
    ", we find that the stellar velocity dispersions change by @xmath1056  km@xmath3 .",
    "in general , jaffe models give slightly lower velocity dispersions for a fixed value of @xmath94 and the best - fit models therefore yield slightly higher values of @xmath94 ( few hundredths ) compared with the hernquist models .",
    "however , the differences are not significant , given the errors on dispersion profile , and therefore we conclude that our results are insensitive to the precise shape of the inner luminosity density profile .    for completeness , we note that our model with @xmath106 results in a central stellar velocity dispersion of @xmath107=221  km@xmath3  inside @xmath108 , in excellent agreement with the empirically derived value of @xmath107=229@xmath10115  km@xmath3  in sec.[keck ] , confirming the self - consistency of our models .    in conclusion ,",
    "the total mass distribution of galaxy g is well - matched by a single power - law density profile , that is isothermal ( i.e. @xmath109 ) to within @xmath285% , and the velocity ellipsoid of the luminous component is isotropic at least inside @xmath110 of the effective radius .",
    "note that this limit is generally consistent with the limits set by other physical considerations .",
    "in fact , strongly radial orbits would result in radial instability ( e.g. merritt & aguilar 1985 find that osipkov - merritt models with initial jaffe density profile are unstable for @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the jaffe half - mass radius ; for the effects of a dark matter halo see , e.g. , stiavelli & sparke 1991 ) or negative values of the distribution function ( e.g. ciotti 1999 , and references therein ) .      a stellar mass - to - light ratio of m@xmath113/l@xmath114= @xmath115  m@xmath12/l@xmath116is required to account for the mass @xmath117 , enclosed by the einstein radius .",
    "this is larger than the value m@xmath113/l@xmath114=",
    "@xmath118  m@xmath12/l@xmath116  derived from the fp evolution .",
    "if we had no kinematic information this could only be interpreted as marginal evidence for dark matter inside the einstein radius .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion profile changes the situation dramatically : no model where mass follows light can be found to fit the data .",
    "for example , in fig.[fig : dispersion ] we show the velocity dispersion profile for an isotropic velocity distribution and constant m / l model ( open squares ) .",
    "the dispersion falls too sharply with radius and this model can be excluded at the @xmath119  cl . even increasing @xmath4 by 10% and decreasing @xmath57 by 10% ( twice its error )  both resulting in a smaller stellar velocity dispersion  the fit ( open stars )",
    "can still be excluded at the @xmath1499.9% cl .",
    "setting @xmath104 for the latter model ( not shown ) worsens the fit and the model can be excluded at @xmath119  cl .",
    "strong tangentially anisotropic models for lens galaxies ( see e.g. romanowsky & kochanek 1999 ) , although probably not very likely , can lead to flatter velocity dispersion profiles , even if m / l is constant .",
    "we therefore tested models with constant negative values of @xmath76 . for @xmath120 , we find that the dispersion profile indeed becomes flat",
    ". however , the predicted stellar velocity dispersion is much higher ( i.e. 240260  km@xmath3 ) than the observed values and the model is excluded at @xmath119  cl .",
    "models with @xmath121 can only fit the data when @xmath57 is lowered by @xmath2830% .",
    "this is at least six times the error on @xmath57 and is incompatible with any acceptable lens model of 0047@xmath0281 .",
    "we therefore conclude that mass does not follow light in the lens galaxy g of 0047@xmath0281 , but that m / l must increase with radius .",
    "this is a key illustration that knowledge of the enclosed mass , @xmath117 , inferred from the gravitational lens models , breaks the mass  anisotropy degeneracy .",
    "we now turn to the two - component models described in section  5 , to assess the density profile of the halo . in fig.[fig : lhplot ] we show the likelihood contours ( dashed lines ) as a function of the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( m@xmath113/l@xmath114 ) and inner slope of the dark - matter halo ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "we choose two representative values for the anisotropy radius , @xmath104 and @xmath103 .",
    "note that both the mass within the einstein radius ( m@xmath122 ) and @xmath80 are fixed for all models in figures  5(a ) and 5(b ) .",
    "hence , for each panel we effectively have two free parameters and three data points corresponding to the velocity dispersion profile ( a fourth is given by the @xmath123 measured by the evolution of the fp , section  [ sec : fp ] ) .",
    "we find that : ( i ) for m@xmath113/l@xmath114@xmath124 , the slope of the dark - matter halo @xmath83 approaches @xmath282 , consistent with the findings of sec.[sec : slope ] ( panel c ) .",
    "( ii ) for increasing values of m@xmath113/l@xmath114 , the total density profile and the velocity dispersion profile become steeper .",
    "hence , @xmath83 has to decrease to fit the data .    when we include constraints on m@xmath113/l@xmath114  from the fundamental plane ( sec.3 ) , the limits tighten on both m@xmath113/l@xmath114  and @xmath83 ( solid contours in fig.[fig : lhplot ] ) .",
    "remarkably , we find that the stellar mass - to - light ratio inferred from the fp agrees well with the maximum stellar mass - to - light ratio allowed by our isotropic dynamical models ( as for mg2016 + 112 ; tk02 ) .",
    "such a `` maximum - bulge solution '' is in that sense equivalent to the `` maximum - disk solution '' for spiral galaxies ( e.g. van albada & sancisi 1986 ) .",
    "we note however that the uncertainties are still considerable .",
    "in addition , the following limits are found : ( i ) m@xmath113/l@xmath114=@xmath125  m@xmath12/l@xmath116  and @xmath83@xmath1261.55 ( 68%  cl ) for @xmath103 and ( ii ) m@xmath113/l@xmath114=@xmath127  m@xmath12/l@xmath116  and @xmath128 ( 68%  cl ) for @xmath104 . because the velocity dispersion profile steepens with increasing radial anisotropy , a smaller @xmath83 is required to retain a relatively flat dispersion profile .",
    "this explains the mild degeneracy between @xmath80 and @xmath83 .    in the context of adiabatic contraction ( ac ) models ( e.g. blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 ; mo , mao and white 1998 ) , the initial slope ( @xmath129 ) of the dark - matter halo , i.e. before baryons assembled in the dark - matter potential well , is in general expected to be shallower than the observed dm slope ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "we find that the difference between @xmath129 and @xmath83 is relatively small , because the stellar mass in the case of 0047@xmath0280 is quite extended ( i.e. large effective radius ) and therefore affects the dark - matter slope less than found in mg2016 + 112 ( tk02 ) , for example . even in the absence of ac , however , we find that @xmath130 ( moore et al .  1998 ;",
    "ghigna et al .",
    "2001 ) is inconsistent with the results from 0047@xmath0281 at the 90%(68% ) cl for @xmath131 , whereas the nfw profile ( @xmath132 ; navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) is consistent at the 68% cl for @xmath133 .",
    "however , any mechanism , including ac , that steepens the initial slope by more that @xmath1340.6 , would imply that the results from 0047@xmath0281 are inconsistent with cdm simulations .",
    "we have presented hst and keck observations of the gravitational lens system 0047 - 281 . in particular , hst images have been used to measure the surface photometry of the lens galaxy g and to build a simple lens model of the quadruple - image system .",
    "keck - esi data have been used to measure a spatially resolved velocity dispersion profile extended beyond the effective radius , with exquisite accuracy ( @xmath29% ) .",
    "we have combined all these measurements to study the internal structure and dynamics of the lens galaxy at @xmath7 , finding the following :    * ( i ) * the offset of galaxy g from the local fundamental plane , @xmath135 between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , is consistent with what is observed for field e / s0 galaxies at similar redshift ( t02 ) , i.e. somewhat larger than for cluster e / s0 galaxies . in terms of pure luminosity evolution",
    "this could be explained with intermediate age single stellar populations , or  more likely  with secondary episodes of star formation contributing a fraction of young stars to an old underlying stellar population ( see discussion in t02 ) .    *",
    "( ii ) * no dark - matter or constant m / l models are excluded at @xmath119  cl . also constant m / l models with strongly tangential anisotropy of the stellar velocity ellipsoid are excluded at @xmath1499.9%  cl .    *",
    "( iii ) * the stellar mass - to - light ratio m@xmath113/l@xmath114=@xmath136  m@xmath12/l@xmath116  obtained from the offset of the fp is inconsistent with the required m@xmath113/l@xmath114=@xmath137  m@xmath12/l@xmath116 to fully account for @xmath117 .",
    "this suggest the presence of dark matter .",
    "the fp value is consistent with what is obtained with our two - component dynamical models , and combining the two constraints we find m@xmath113/l@xmath114=@xmath138  m@xmath12/l@xmath116  ( 68% cl ) for an isotropic velocity ellipsoid .",
    "hence , dark matter comprises a fraction of @xmath139 of the total mass enclosed by the einstein radius of 8.70@xmath140kpc for @xmath103 . for @xmath141",
    "this fraction increases to @xmath142 .",
    "the data are also consistent with an osipkov - merritt ( om ) radial anisotropy with anisotropy radius @xmath143 ( 68 % cl ) .    *",
    "( iv ) * the total ( luminous plus dark ) mass distribution inside the einstein radius can be described by a single power - law density distribution , @xmath16 , with @xmath98 ( 68% cl ) for isotropic models , i.e. @xmath103 . in general , @xmath17 ( 68% cl ) is found .",
    "the systematic error is estimated at 0.1 .    * ( v ) * an upper limit @xmath144 ( 68 % cl ) is found on the slope on the dark - matter halo inside the einstein radius for an isotropic model .",
    "this limit tightens to @xmath145 for mildly anisotropic models with @xmath104 .",
    "initial dark - matter profiles with @xmath130 ( moore et al .",
    "1998 ; ghigna et al .",
    "2001 ) are therefore only marginally acceptable , especially since the profile is expected to be less steep before the galaxy assembled .",
    "if @xmath83 steepens by @xmath146 during galaxy formation all cdm simulations are inconsistent with our results .    in summary ,",
    "the lens galaxy in 0047@xmath0281 appears to convey the same picture formulated for mg2016 + 112 that early - type galaxies at significant look - back times can be effectively described by a @xmath39luminous component ( modeled in this paper as either a hernquist or jaffe profile ) embedded in a nearly - isothermal total mass distribution and that their stellar velocity dispersion is relatively isotropic , in particular inside the effective radius .",
    "in fact , both lens galaxies in mg2016 + 112 ( kt02 , tk02 ) and 0047@xmath0281 show that the total mass distribution is well approximated to within 5% by a simple power law density profile @xmath109 ( i.e. isothermal ) . whether this conclusion can be generalized , however , requires the analysis of more systems .",
    "even more so , we have shown that deviations from isothermality or isotropy in the lens galaxies of 0047@xmath0281 and mg2016 + 112 quickly lead to inconsistencies with constraints from either the fp , the observed stellar kinematics , the stellar mass - to - light ratio , observations of local e / s0 galaxies , the gravitational - lens models , etc . , whereas the models that fit all constraints are internally consistent , appear to agree with all observational constraints available , and indicate both isothermality and near - isotropy . constant",
    "m / l or steep mass profiles inside the einstein radius are excluded at very high confidence levels .",
    "a physical explanation is required _ if _ isotropy and the almost perfect isothermality are confirmed to be generic features of early - type galaxies .",
    "in particular , this regularity might suggest that luminous and dark - matter were strongly coupled at some point during galaxy assembly . whereas adiabatic contraction has been suggested as a mechanism that can lead to near - isothermal mass profiles ( e.g.  keeton 2001 ) , it is not clear why such a process should _ only _ stop when the density profile is isothermal to better than apparently a few percent ( see also tk02 ) .",
    "adiabatic contraction also leads to a slope of the inner density profile , inconsistent with the observed absence of lensed images in the centers of lens galaxies ( e.g.  keeton 2001 ) , if either the central black holes are not very massive or the inner density profiles do not steepen through some other process .",
    "violent relaxation could be a natural and viable explanation for this regularity , although it should also be explained why luminous and dark matter have _ different _",
    "density profiles ( see discussion in tk02 and references therein ) . a combination of the two processes during some period in the formation of the galaxy can not be excluded .",
    "the striking similarity of the internal structure of e / s0 galaxies at large look - back times with the internal structure of local e / s0 galaxies ( e.g. franx et al .",

    "; see also kochanek 1995 and reviews by de zeeuw & franx 1991 ; bertin & stiavelli 1993 ; merritt 1999 ) suggests that little structural evolution occurred during the past 8 gyrs ( although again a larger sample is needed to make a quantitative and general statement ) . the lack of significant structural evolution is also suggested by the remarkable agreement between the stellar m@xmath113/l@xmath114 obtained with our dynamical models and the stellar m@xmath113/l@xmath114 estimated using the fp evolution .",
    "this fact adds further evidence in favor of a scenario where the general population of massive ( field ) e / s0 galaxies changed little in the past 8 gyrs ( from @xmath147 )  as indicated for example by the modest evolution in their number density ( schade et al .",
    "1999 ; i m et al .  2002 ; cohen 2002 ; mccarthy et al.2002 ) and by the little evolution in the scatter of the fp ( t02 )  with most of the evolution being driven by ageing of old stars and secondary episodes of star formation ( jimenez et al .",
