    "waves propagating in a curved spacetime develop `` tails '' . in particular , it is well established that the _ dominant _ late - time behaviour of massless fields propagating in black - hole spacetimes is a power - law tail .",
    "price @xcite was the first to analyze the mechanism by which the spacetime outside a ( nearly spherical ) collapsing star divests itself of all radiative multipole moments , and leaves behind a schwarzschild black hole ; it was demonstrated that all radiative perturbations decay asymptotically as an inverse power of time .",
    "physically , these inverse power - law tails are associated with the backscattering of waves off the effective curvature potential at asymptotically far regions @xcite .",
    "the analysis of price was extended by other authors .",
    "bik @xcite generalized the analysis and studied the dynamics of a scalar field in a _ charged _ reissner - nordstrm spacetime .",
    "he also found an asymptotic inverse power - law decay of the field , with the _ same _ power indices as in the schwarzschild spacetime ( with the exception of the _ extremal _ reissner - nordstrm black hole @xcite ) . in a brilliant work , leaver @xcite demonstrated that the late - time tail can be associated with the existence of a branch cut in the green s function for the wave propagation problem .",
    "gundlach , price , and pullin @xcite showed that these inverse power - law tails also characterize the late - time evolution of radiative fields at future null infinity , and at the black - hole outer horizon .",
    "furthermore , they showed that power - law tails are a genuine feature of gravitational collapse ",
    "the existence of these tails was demonstrated in full non - linear numerical simulations of the spherically symmetric collapse of a self - gravitating scalar field @xcite ( this was later reproduced in @xcite ) .",
    "our current understanding of the late - time tail is , however , somewhat unsatisfactory .",
    "the ( _ leading order _ ) power - law tails in black - hole spacetimes are well established @xcite , but the resultant formulae are only truly useful at very _",
    "late _ times . in a typical evolution scenario",
    "there is a considerable time window in which the signal is no longer dominated by the quasinormal modes @xcite , but the leading order power - law tail has not yet taken over @xcite .    the purpose of this paper is to derive analytic expressions for the _ higher - order corrections _ which `` contaminate '' the well - known power - law tail in a spherically symmetric gravitational collapse .",
    "the determination of these higher - order terms is important from several points of view : the analyses of bik @xcite and gundlach et .",
    "@xcite established the fact that the leading - order power - law tail is _ universal _ in the sense that it is _ independent _ of the black - hole electric charge ( i.e. , the power index in a _ charged _ reissner - nordstrm spacetime was shown to be identical with the one found by price @xcite for the neutral schwarzschild black hole ) .",
    "this observation begs the question : what fingerprints ( if any ) does the black - hole electric charge leave on the field s decay ?",
    "moreover , the calculation of higher - order corrections to the leading order power - law tail is also of practical importance ; this is especially crucial for the determination of the power index from numerical simulations .",
    "the dominant inverse power - law tail is _",
    "`` contaminated '' _ by higher - order terms , whose effect become larger as the aveliable time of integration decreases .",
    "the precise power index is expected only at infinitely - late time .",
    "thus , in practice , the _ limited _ time of integration introduces an inherent error in the determination of the power index . the only systematic approach to _",
    "quantify _ the errors which are introduced by the finite integration time is to study _ higher - order corrections_. if one computes the contaminated part of the late - time tail , then the ratio of the corrections to the leading order term is a systematic , quantitative , indication of the error caused by the _",
    "finite_-time numerical calculation .",
    "these questions and several others are addressed in the present paper .",

    "this effect is caused by the time dilation between static frames and infalling frames .",
    "a static external observer sees all processes on the stellar surface become `` frozen '' as the star approaches the horizon .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) represent the primary waves in the wave front , while the sum represents backscattered waves .",
