    "x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) consist of a compact object , either a neutron star or black hole , which accretes matter from a companion star .",
    "active xrbs have luminosities of @xmath410@xmath5 erg s@xmath3  ( those @xmath6@xmath7 erg s@xmath3  are classified as ultra - luminous x - ray sources ) while those in quiescence are @xmath810@xmath9 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "xrbs are classified into two main categories based on the mass of the companion star : low - mass ( lmxb ) and high - mass ( hmxb ) @xcite .",

    "lmxb formation is more efficient in globular clusters ( gcs ) than in the field of a galaxy due to the higher stellar densities in gcs @xcite . in the milky way ,",
    "lmxb formation is approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient in gcs @xcite .",
    "conversely , hmxbs are associated with star - forming regions ( ob associations , h  ii  regions , and infrared - bright dusty regions ) as opposed to star clusters @xcite . due to their evolutionary timescales , lmxbs trace the stellar mass of a galaxy @xcite while hmxbs probe the star formation rate @xcite within the past @xmath4100 myr @xcite .",

    "this hinders our ability to obtain a complete sample of the galaxy s xrb population .",
    "fortunately , m31 provides a convenient nearby analogue that allows us to perform an analysis of the faint x - ray population in a large galaxy .",
    "m31 s xrb population has been studied numerous times over the past decades with various x - ray telescopes ( @xmath12 ( _ xmm - newton _ ) , @xmath13 ( _ rosat _ ) , @xmath14 ) .",
    "however , only the spatial resolution of _ chandra _  allows us to study low - luminosity x - ray sources by separating them from the diffuse emission in the disk and crowding in the bulge .",
    "the lmxbs in m31 have been extensively studied by various groups @xcite that report on x - ray luminosity functions , spatial distributions , variability , and spectral analysis .",
    "@xcite used _ xmm - newton _  to study 80% of the 416 confirmed gcs in m31 @xcite .",

    "@xcite predicted a large number of faint transient sources in the bulge of m31 , similar to the numerous faint x - ray sources ( accreting millisecond pulsars ) found in the galactic center @xcite .    a recent study by @xcite with _ xmm - newton _  covered all of m31 for the first time and reported on the x - ray source population compared to all previous studies .",
    "the survey catalogued 1897 point sources ( 914 new ) and reached a limit of @xmath410@xmath15 erg s@xmath3  in the @xmath16 kev energy band .",
    "sources were classified / identified by x - ray hardness ratios , spatial extent and distribution , cross - correlations in other wavelengths , and variability ( using _ chandra _  and _ rosat _",

    "they found 10 field lmxbs and 26 field lmxb candidates by analyzing long - term x - ray source variability .",
    "in addition , another 36 lmxbs were associated with gcs and 17 lmxb candidates were associated with gc candidates .",
    "no hmxbs were identified - in fact none have been confirmed in m31 to date - although 2 new candidates were proposed in addition to the 18 candidates from @xcite .",
    "the comprehensive x - ray population analysis by @xcite has classified hundreds of sources and shed light on their long - term variability and spatial / flux distributions .",
    "however , they pointed out that @xmath465% of their point sources are classified as `` hard '' , meaning that they have no optical identification and their x - ray colors are ambiguous : they could be xrbs , supernova remnants , or background active galaxies .",
    "@xcite have attempted to address the issue of unclassified x - ray point sources by identifying them using x - ray data alone .",
    "they used structure functions , which estimate the mean intensity deviation of data over a time interval . by determining structure functions for each source they constrained its variability and were able to differentiate xrbs from active galactic nuclei .",
    "they found 220 x - ray sources above @xmath1710@xmath15 erg s@xmath3  with significantly more variability than expected in the structure function for active galactic nuclei .",
    "based on their analysis they classified these sources as xrbs , with an additional 30 xrb sources for a total of 250 probable xrbs ( 200 new ) out of their sample of 528 x - ray sources in the central 20  of m31 .",
    "low - luminosity xrbs are more variable than luminous xrbs and thus are well - suited to this classification technique given sufficient signal - to - noise data .",
    "one of the most powerful methods to confidently classify an x - ray source is identifying an optical counterpart .",
    "however , in crowded and extragalactic fields this generally requires the exquisite spatial resolution of _ hst_. the ability to observe a large fraction of identified x - ray sources is limited since _",

    "however , a logistic regression analysis showed that the f475w magnitude is the most significant predictor followed by the effective radius . the f475w@xmath0f814w color ( an indicator of metallicity in old stellar populations ) was not a significant predictor of whether a cluster hosted an x - ray source .",
    "a statistical analysis using logistic regression is a more robust method than comparing averages and as such accurately represents trends in the data .",
    "@xcite found different trends when using _ xmm - newton _  observations of m31 to identify 45 gc - lmxbs , namely that the stellar collision rate ( proportional to stellar density and core radius ) , luminosity , and metallicity are all significant .",
    "however , @xcite came to similar conclusions to ours when using _ hst _",
    "data to derive structural parameters for 29 gc - lmxbs , and complementing the sample with published values for a total of 41 gc - lmxbs and 65 non - lmxb gcs .",
    "they found the probability of a gc hosting an x - ray source increased with increasing collision rate and proximity to the galaxy center .",
    "metallicity was not as important a predictor but an increasing cluster mass at fixed collision rate decreased the probability of hosting an x - ray source ( although the authors stress this may be a sample selection effect ) .",
    "the latter result does not agree with our positive trend between gc magnitude ( which scales with mass ) and a gc s probability of hosting an lmxb .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to our limited sample of bulge gcs that do not have as wide a range in metallicity as gcs at larger galactocentric distances .",
    "studies of the gc - lmxb connection in spiral galaxies are limited .",
    "@xcite studied xrbs in the antennae galaxies and found that massive young star clusters are more likely to host an x - ray source than less massive young clusters . when studying 32 gc - lmxbs in the spiral galaxy m104 with _",
    "chandra _ , @xcite found that metal - rich gcs were more likely to host an x - ray source .",
    "@xcite found similar trends in the milky way .",
    "@xcite does mention that the observed trends in m31 are weaker than those found for elliptical galaxies , which further stresses the need to analyze the updated star cluster data from phat with _",
    "chandra _ , along with surveys of other spiral galaxies .",
    "our stacking results gave upper limits of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3  across all bands for different stacks .",
    "when stacking star clusters that were brightest ( f475w magnitude ) , most compact ( smallest @xmath89 ) , and a combination of the two , we found that the detection significance increased across all bands , although not to a statistically significant level .",
    "due to the proximity of m31 the upper limits are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than for star clusters in m51 @xcite",
    ". studies of globular clusters in the milky way have found a plethora of faint x - ray sources that include quiescent xrbs ( typically @xmath126 erg s@xmath3 ) @xcite . in gc 47",
    "tucanae , five classified quiescent lmxbs had a mean @xmath127 kev ) @xmath2 erg s@xmath3  @xcite .",
    "therefore , assuming m31 s gcs are similar to those in the milky way , we should be probing this population with our stacking analysis . given that a single gc may only have a handful of faint lmxbs , even our stacked sample of 4 of the brightest and smallest gcs fails to provide a detection .",
    "at this point it seems that stacking star clusters to identify faint xrbs is proving difficult , at least in spiral galaxies / crowded fields . with the higher concentration of x - ray sources in galaxy bulges",
    "source crowding is a problem . along with diffuse emission in spiral disks ,",
    "this complicates stacking analyses . specifically , the background level of each image in a stack is larger making it more difficult to detect faint sources in the aperture . ultimately a detailed , deep survey of a large sample of gcs in an early - type galaxy would be most promising for obtaining a stacking detection .",
    "h  ii  regions  emit thermal x - rays at @xmath128 and @xmath129 kev due to shocks from ob star winds and supernovae / supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "the lifetimes of h  ii  regions  ( a few myr ) are long enough that hmxbs can form , providing another possible source of x - ray emission .",
    "therefore we would expect x - ray emission in h  ii  regions  to come from various sources , with bright hmxbs and supernova remnants ( if present ) dominating .",
    "@xcite found an hmxb in the giant h  ii  region  ic131 in m33 , while @xcite found 2 hmxb candidates in h  ii  regions  in m83 .",
    "@xcite studied ultraluminous x - ray sources in nearby galaxies and concluded that 18 of 27 were located inside ob associations or star forming regions .",
    "however , most hmxbs are not found in h  ii  regions  or ob associations . in the milky way",
    ", @xcite found clustering between 79 hmxbs and 458 ob associations ( 7@xmath113 for distances",
    "@xmath130 kpc ) .",
    "the average offset of 0.4 @xmath20 0.2 kpc between hmxbs and ob associations was consistent with compact object natal kicks of 100 @xmath20 50 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the average kinematical age ( time from supernova to hmxb phase ) was @xmath44 myr .",
    "a follow up to this work by @xcite found the upper limit on kinematical age to be @xmath43 myr .",
    "therefore unless natal kicks are small hmxbs could be located @xmath11 6.5  ( 400 pc ) from h  ii  regions  in m31 .",
    "based on these results one would expect most x - ray emission from h  ii  regions  to be thermal rather than from xrbs .    from table [ tab : htwoxrmatches ]",
    "most of the previous classifications for h  ii  regions  hosting x - ray point sources in m31 have been supernova remnants as opposed to hmxbs .",
    "however , these are only supernova remnant candidates that have been found using optical line ratios ( h@xmath1/s  ii ) . in addition",
    ", our x - ray color - color plot ( figure [ fig : xraycc ] ) shows that none of the x - ray point sources appear in the supernova remnant regime .",
    "when comparing the average radii of matched and unmatched h  ii  regions  those that were more compact were the most likely hosts of x - ray sources .",
    "nevertheless , a logistic regression analysis showed that both the luminosity and radius of an h  ii  region  were not significant predictors of it hosting an x - ray source .",
    "the four h  ii  region  matches that are previously unidentified can be classified as hmxb candidates and require further analysis to determine their nature . as with star clusters our stacking results of h  ii  regions  gave upper limits of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3  across all bands for most stacks .",
    "we saw the most improvement in detection significance ( soft band ) when filtering by the smallest radii ( @xmath131 pc ) and @xmath132 erg s@xmath3 , although not to a statistically significant level .      while most of the _ chandra _  observations have been restricted to the central region of m31 , an extension of the data to the disk",
    "is necessary to probe both young star clusters and the numerous h  ii  regions .",
    "the resolution of x - ray data that does cover most of m31 ( i.e.  _ xmm - newton _  and _ rosat _ ) is not sufficient to distinguish individual x - ray point sources in crowded regions or reliably associate them with clusters .",
    "more specifically , with the exquisite resolution of _ hst _  observations such as the phat survey only _ chandra _  will allow for robust identification of x - ray counterparts .",
    "figure [ fig : acis - fov ] is truly striking .",
    "chandra _",
    "acis - i data does cover a large portion of the first 8 bricks of the phat survey , the remaining bricks and almost the entire northeast quadrant of m31 are unobserved . in m31 ,",
    "_ chandra _  has been used mostly for a long - term monitoring program of the supermassive black hole in the nucleus .",
    "other observations throughout the galaxy were used to study supersoft x - ray sources . due to the degradation of the psf at large off - axis angles , data outside of the acis - s3 chip",
    "has poor resolution and therefore is not useful even for stacking .",
    "further motivation lies in the absence of a confirmed hmxb in m31 , which can be addressed by using both the h  ii  region  and star cluster catalogues available to identify candidates . investigating the spiral arm regions that the phat survey has observed with ( future ) complementary _ chandra _  data would be invaluable to furthering our understanding of the xrb population in m31 .",
    "we used all 121 publicly available _ chandra _  acis observations of m31 to complete a study of star clusters and h  ii  regions .",
    "specifically , we analyzed 83 star clusters in the bulge of m31 from the phat survey and found 15 unique matches ( 18% ) to 17 x - ray point sources within 1  ( 3.8 pc ) . when correcting our percentage of matches to completeness limits of past surveys we found similar results .",
    "the most compact , brightest , and reddest clusters preferentially hosted x - ray sources , on average .",
    "logistic regression showed that the star cluster f475w magnitude was the most important predictor of finding a star cluster x - ray source .",
    "this follows from the fact that the most luminous and therefore most massive star clusters are more likely to host xrbs .",
    "a less significant predictor was @xmath89 , which associated smaller star clusters ( probes compactness to some extent ) with x - ray sources .",
    "the link between these two properties and xrbs stems from the high densities and larger number of stars that create dynamical conditions most favorable for the formation of xrbs . the f475w@xmath0f814w color , an indicator of metallicity in old stellar populations , was not a significant predictor for star clusters hosting x - ray point sources .",
    "the majority of clusters in our sample are metal - rich and thus we do not have an evenly distributed sample of blue and red clusters . a more complete survey with a larger spread in metallicity is required to confirm this result .",
    "a stacking analysis resulted in non - detections across all energy bands and average upper limits of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with quiescent xrb luminosities in the milky way .    from 1566 h  ii  regions  in the field of view of the _ chandra _  data only 10 matched to 9 unique x - ray point sources within 3  ( 11 pc ) .",
    "on average , the matches corresponded to the most compact h  ii  regions .",
    "however , a logistic regression analysis showed that neither the radius nor h@xmath1 luminosity was a significant predictor of an h  ii  region  hosting an x - ray source . from previous optical emission - line classifications",
    "most of these sources were supernova remnant candidates .",
    "four sources that have no previous optical identifications are hmxb candidates .",
