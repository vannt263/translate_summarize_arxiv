    "this is equivalent to the fact that for @xmath19 large enough , there is a vector in @xmath576 with the @xmath20-property that does not have the @xmath35-property , and another vector with the @xmath35-property that does not have the @xmath20-property .",

    "the complete at - graph @xmath579 has no even @xmath20 , but it is not independently @xmath6-realizable since the triangles @xmath580 and @xmath581 form an odd @xmath35 .    the other example is trivial : the at - graph @xmath582 has no odd @xmath35 but it is not independently @xmath6-realizable since it is an even @xmath20 .

    "in the proof of theorem  [ veta_z2_charakterizace ] we have shown that by edge - vertex switches , we can transform any drawing of @xmath577 to a drawing where all the edges incident to a chosen vertex @xmath530 cross every independent edge an even number of times .",

    "however , the vectors characterizing the drawings of @xmath577 satisfy the @xmath35 property but do not satisfy the @xmath20-property , so they correspond to the @xmath588 odd cycles in the petersen graph , @xmath589 of them isomorphic to @xmath590 and the remaining @xmath591 isomorphic to @xmath592 .    for @xmath593 ,",
    "the whole space @xmath43 of the vectors with the @xmath20-property and the @xmath35-property has dimension @xmath594 , since each of the @xmath595 edge - vertex switches @xmath482 with @xmath596 and @xmath597 changes the parity of the number of crossings for exactly one pair of edges of the type @xmath523 .",
