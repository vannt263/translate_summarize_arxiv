    "cepheid variables serve as fundamental calibrators of the cosmic distance scale , making these stars of vital importance to extragalactic astronomy and cosmology ( freedman et al . 2001 ; di benedetto 2013 and references therein ) .",
    "however , important gaps remain in our understanding of the physics and evolution of cepheids .",
    "one of the most confounding puzzles is the decades - old problem known as the  cepheid mass discrepancy \" : mass estimates based on stellar evolution models are inconsistent with pulsation masses ( derived from the mass - dependent period - luminosity relation ) and with masses inferred from orbital dynamics ( e.g. , christy 1968 ; cox 1980 ; pietrzyski et al . 2010 ) .",
    "discrepancies of @xmath210 - 20% have persisted despite continued improvements in evolutionary models ( e.g. , bono et al .",
    "2002 ; caputo et al . 2005 ; keller & wood 2006 ; neilson et al .",
    "proposed solutions have included extra mixing , rotation , the need for better radiative opacities , and perhaps most importantly , _ mass - loss _",
    "( e.g. , cox 1980 ; bono et al .",
    "2006 ; neilson et al .",
    "2011 , 2012a , b ) .",
    "if mass loss is occurring during the cepheid evolutionary phase , this could have important implications for the use of cepheids as distance indicators , since the presence of circumstellar material may add scatter to inferred luminosities in the form of extra extinction in the visible and excess emission at ir wavelengths ( neilson et al .",
    "2009 ; gallenne et al .",
    "2013 ; schmidt 2015 ) . indeed , accounting for these effects",
    "may be key to resolving the discrepancy between the hubble constant determination from cepheids compared with that derived from cosmic microwave background measurements ( e.g. , riess et al .",
    ". mass loss on the instability strip would also impact other evolutionary stages of intermediate mass stars , including the relative lifetimes of the red and blue supergiant phases ( e.g. , dohm - palmer & skillman 2002 ) , and the determination of what is the maximum initial mass of a star that will end its life as a white dwarf rather than a supernova .",
    "while cepheid mass loss has been suspected for decades ( see review by cox 1980 ) , the direct and unambiguous detection of escaped or outflowing material from cepheids has proved to be challenging , leading to empirically estimated mass - loss rates ( or upper limits ) spanning several orders of magnitude ( @xmath7 to @xmath8 yr@xmath4 ; mcalary & welch 1986 ; welch & duric 1988 ; deasy 1988 ; bhm - vitense & love 1994 ; neilson et al .",
    "however , a series of recent studies has provided mounting evidence that not only is mass loss common for stars on the instability strip , but it typically occurs at rates high enough to significantly impact the star s evolutionary track .    in a study based on _ spitzer _ infrared ( ir ) imaging data , marengo et al .",
    "( 2010b ) reported the discovery of a bow shock surrounding the cepheid archetype @xmath9  cephei ( @xmath9  cep ) , providing direct evidence for the existence of a stellar wind , and hence , ongoing mass loss at a rate of @xmath10 yr@xmath4 .",
    "extended ir emission was also detected with _ spitzer _ around several other cepheids by barmby et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , including three stars with extended emission seen in multiple ir bands and four other stars with evidence for extended emission in at least one band .",
    "in addition , on scales closer to the star , near- and mid - ir interferometry have revealed what appear to be warm , dusty circumstellar envelopes on scales ranging from a few stellar radii ( mrand et al .",
    "2006 ; kervella et al .",
    "2006 ; gallenne et al . 2013 ) to several hundred au ( kervella et al .",
    "2009 ) .    as noted by some authors ( e.g. , schmidt 2015 ) ,",
    "observed ir excesses and extended ir emission are not necessarily a _",
    "direct _ product of ongoing mass loss , particularly dusty mass loss .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath9  cep , the extended ir nebulosity may be somehow linked with the presence of a binary companion ( anderson et al .",
    "2015 ) , while in the case of rs  pup , the vast circumstellar nebulosity may represent a pre - existing interstellar cloud ( kervella et al .",
    "however , in both of these cases , there is evidence that a stellar wind has had a role in _ shaping _ the ir - emitting material .",
    "similarly , marengo et al .",
    "( 2010a ) suggested that near - ir emission seen close to the star may result from shocked gas emission rather than dust .",
    "nonetheless , the presence of this emission is consistent with a pulsationally - driven wind .",
    "another line of evidence for cepheid mass loss comes from the work of neilson et al .",
    "( 2012b ) , who analyzed the observed rates of period change , @xmath11 , for a sample of 200 galactic cepheids and compared the results to stellar evolution models .",
    "they found that models without mass loss could not reproduce the observed @xmath11 trends",
    ". however , mass loss on the cepheid instability strip at a mean rate @xmath12 yr@xmath4 rectifies the models with observations . for the specific case of polaris , neilson et al .",
    "( 2012a ) concluded that a mass - loss rate of @xmath13 yr@xmath4 is necessary to account for the secular period change of this star over the past @xmath2200 years .    because of the moderate temperatures of cepheids ( @xmath25000 - 6000",
    "k ) , their winds are expected to be predominantly neutral and atomic ( glassgold & huggins 1983 ) , with at most , a modest ionized fraction ( e.g. , engle et al .",
    "this makes the  21-cm line a potentially powerful tracer of cepheid outflows .",
    "although contamination from interstellar emission along the line - of - sight tends to be strong toward sources near the galactic plane , the finite outflow velocity of the wind is expected in most cases to shift a portion of the circumstellar gas outside of the velocity range most strongly affected by line - of - sight emission .",
    "in addition , interferometers act as spatial filters against the largest scale components of the line - of - sight emission , which can aid in disentangling circumstellar signals from foreground and/or background signals ( bowers & knapp 1987 ; matthews & reid 2007 ; le  bertre et al .",
    "2012 ) .    motivated by these factors , matthews et al .",
    "( 2012 ; hereafter m12 ) used the legacy very large array to observe @xmath9  cep in the  21-cm line with the goal of searching for a gaseous counterpart to the stellar wind revealed by the _",
    "spitzer _ observations of marengo et al .",
    "( 2010b ) . based on the  data , m12 reported the discovery of an extended  nebula ( @xmath14 , or 1  pc across ) surrounding the position of @xmath9  cep .",
    "this nebula exhibits a head - tail morphology , consistent with debris that was ejected from the star and subsequently sculpted by its interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "m12 derived an outflow velocity for the wind of @xmath151.2  the first ever directly measured from a cepheid  and constrained the mass - loss rate to be @xmath16 yr@xmath4 .",
    "if similar  envelopes are present around other cepheids , this would have profound implications for our understanding of these stars and our ability to constrain their mass - loss and evolutionary histories .",
    "for this reason , we have undertaken  imaging observations of a sample of four additional galactic cepheids using the upgraded karl f. jansky very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory .",
    "as described below , these observations have uncovered evidence for circumstellar material associated with one additional cepheid and allow us to place limits on the mass of circumstellar material associated with the three remaining targets .",
    "a sample of four galactic cepheids was targeted in the present study : rs  puppis ( rs  pup ) , t  monocerotis ( t  mon ) , x  cygni ( x  cyg ) , and @xmath0  geminorum ( @xmath0  gem ) .",
    "some of their properties are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the long - period cepheid rs  pup is one of the brightest known cepheids in the galaxy . based on its rate of period change",
    "it is thought to be on its third crossing of the instability strip ( berdnikov et al .",
    "this star is unique among galactic cepheids in being surrounded by an extended ( @xmath17 across ) optical reflection nebula ( westerlund 1961 ) .",
    "this nebula is also visible in the ir ( e.g. , mcalary & welch 1986 ) , including the multi - band _ spitzer _ observations presented by kervella et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and barmby et al .",
    "although it was suggested early - on that the rs  pup nebula may be the result of mass loss ( either during the cepheid phase or a previous red giant stage ; havlen 1972 ) , kervella et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2012 ) argued that the bulk of the nebula instead comprises cold , dusty interstellar material ( see also deasy 1988 ; barmby et al .",
    "2011 ) that was shaped and compressed by a stellar wind or outflow , possibly during an earlier evolutionary phase as a rapidly rotating b dwarf",
    ". however , kervella et al . (",
    "2009 ) also detected evidence of a warm emission component toward rs  pup at 10  @xmath18 m , with spatial scales of @xmath2100 to 1000  au .",
    "this latter component is interpreted as a hallmark of ongoing cepheid - phase mass loss ( see also gallenne et al .",
    "2011 ) .    among the remaining stars in the barmby et al .",
    "( 2011 ) sample that showed either clear or possible extended emission , only two are far enough north to observe with the vla : t  mon and x  cyg . both of these stars show extended emission at 8.0  @xmath18 m , but only tentative detections at 24@xmath18 m and/or 70@xmath18 m .",
    "x  cyg is one of the most luminous classical cepheids visible from the northern hemisphere and is believed to be on its third crossing of the instability strip ( turner 1999 ) .",
    "observations to date provide no compelling evidence for a companion ( evans 1984 , 1992 ; turner 1998 ) , although a low - mass companion with an orbit in the plane of the sky can not be excluded .",
    "t  mon , on the other hand , is a well - known binary ( mariska et al .",
    "1980 ; coulson 1983 ) with an orbital period between 90 and 260 years ( evans et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the companion is a hot , chemically peculiar a star that is itself most likely a binary in a short - period orbit .",
    "t  mon was studied by gallenne et al .",
    "( 2013 ) using mid - ir interferometry , and these authors detected a mid - ir excess that they attributed to the presence of a cse .",
    "in contrast to the other three stars in table  1 , our fourth target , @xmath0  gem , does not exhibit any extended ir emission in the study of barmby et al .",
    "this medium period cepheid was included in the present sample in part to test whether observable signatures of mass loss are exclusive to stars with extended ir emission .",
    "in addition , this star was predicted to have minimal line - of - sight  contamination because of the low cirrus levels seen in the images of barmby et al . and the modest  brightness temperatures along this direction seen in previous  survey data . based on its declining period ( berdnikov et al",
    ". 2000 ) , @xmath0  gem is believed to be on its second crossing of the instability strip ( e.g. , turner et al .",
    "2006 ) .    to provide context for the interpretation of our vla results and to illustrate the strength and velocity extent of the line - of - sight confusion toward each of our targets , we show in figure  [ fig : labspec ]  spectra toward each stellar position ( to within the nearest @xmath19 ) extracted from the leiden argentine bonn ( lab ) all - sky  survey ( kalberla et al .",
    "because the lab spectra were obtained with single - dish telescopes , they are not affected by filtering of large - scale emission ( i.e. , missing short spacing information ) and directly measure the total beam - integrated  flux .",
    "note , however , that the noise level in the lab spectra ( @xmath20.6  jy rms ) precludes the detection of typical weak circumstellar signals , even outside of the velocity ranges affected by interstellar contamination .",

    "in contrast , for velocities @xmath11345  , the lab spectrum toward x  cyg appears virtually free of contaminating emission , providing a relatively clean spectral window to search for circumstellar emission redshifted from the stellar systemic velocity of @xmath11426.4  .",
    "however , based on inspection of our  data cubes , we find no statistically significant emission at or near the stellar position over the velocity range @xmath115  .",

    "we discuss upper limits on the circumstellar  mass and mass - loss rate of x  cyg in section  [ upperlimits ] .",
    "while a chance superposition of an unrelated gas cloud along the line - of - sight can not be entirely excluded as an explanation for the `` shell '' of emission seen near t  mon ( figure  [ fig : tmonmom0 ] ) , several characteristics of this emission are consistent with a possible association with the star .",
    "we now discuss these arguments in more depth , and consider the implications for the evolutionary history of t  mon if this shell is indeed associated with stellar mass - loss .",
    "it is now well - established that detectable circumstellar envelopes of atomic hydrogen , spanning up to a parsec or more in size , form around certain types of evolved , mass - losing stars , and furthermore that the properties of these envelopes are significantly impacted by the space motion of the stars and the interaction of the stellar ejecta with the ism ( e.g. , grard & le  bertre 2006 ; le  bertre et al .",
    "2012 ; matthews et al . 2013 ) . for stars with low space velocities , quasi - spherical shells may be observed , while in cases where the space velocity is sufficiently high , bow shocks may be detectable in ir and ultraviolet wavelengths , and the effects of ram pressure may sweep back a portion of the ejecta to form a trailing gaseous wake ( see m12 ; matthews et al . 2013 and references therein ) .",
    "numerical models also predict that the properties of the shells will change significantly as stars evolve and undergo changes in their mass - loss rates , and as the ejecta expand into the ism ( e.g. , wareing et al . 2007 ; villaver et al . 2012 ) .",
    "however , one general consequence of the central star s space motion will be an eventual shift of the star from the geometric center of the shell to a position nearer its leading edge ( e.g. , smith 1976 ) .",
    "once the mass loss wanes , the star will eventually completely exit the nebula ( smith 1976 ; wareing et al .",
    "2007 ) and leave only a partial shell downstream ( see figure  7d of wareing et al . ) .",
    "as already noted in section  [ tmon ] the space velocity vector of t  mon traces directly back to the approximate geometric center of the detected  shell , consistent with the possibility that this shell could be a mass - loss remnant .",
    "however , at the same time , the fact that the star appears to be nearly completely outside the shell s boundaries implies that if it is circumstellar in origin , the shell must have formed during a _ previous _ epoch of mass - loss that did not continue at a sustained rate to the present day .",
    "the absence of detectable emission along the leading edge of the nebula is also consistent with it being a `` fossil '' shell ( see wareing et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the interaction between the ism and stellar ejecta affects not only the morphology of the circumstellar gas , but also its kinematics , including an appreciable deceleration of the outflowing gas at large distances from the star ( e.g. , matthews et al .",
    "2008 , 2011 ) .",
    "qualitatively , an excess of blueshifted emission , as we see in the case of t  mon , might therefore be explained by the decelerating effect of the ism on the ejecta ( see matthews et al .",
    "this would also imply that the red and blue peaks visible in the spectrum in figure  [ fig : tmonhispec ] can not be directly interpreted as a measure of the stellar outflow speed .",
    "clearly numerical models that explore the interaction of mass - losing cepheids with their environment would be of considerable interest for helping to interpret future observations of cepheids .",
    "numerical models to date have focused on agb and post - agb stars whose wind speeds , mass - loss rates , and mass - loss timescales all may differ significantly from cepheids .",
    "for example , typical agb stars have outflow velocities @xmath1175 - 10  , which are generally several times smaller than those expected for cepheids ( see section  [ upperlimits ] ) .",
    "this means that agb stars are frequently in the regime where @xmath118 is less than the space velocity @xmath119 , whereas cepheids will more typically have @xmath120 ( cf . table  1 ) .",
    "as described above , the morphology of the  nebula northwest of t  mon appears to contain a depression or cavity along its southeast edge .",
    "possible explanations for such a cavity in a circumstellar shell could be instabilities along the leading edge of a shell ( see matthews et al .",
    "2013 ) or the cessation of mass loss from the central star . assuming the nebula lies at the same distance as t  mon , tracing the location of the star backwards along its projected space motion vector places it within this cavity at some time in the past ( assuming the nebula does not have a transverse velocity component different from that of the star ) .",
    "given the space velocity of t  mon ( table  1 ) , an estimate of the travel time from the center of the apparent  cavity to the current stellar position is @xmath12138,000 years , although this is a lower limit to the elapsed time , both because of projection effects and because it assumes that the nebula has remained stationary in the local ism rest frame .",
    "t  mon is believed to be currently on its third crossing of the instability strip ( turner & berdnikov 2001 ) , and based on bono et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we estimate the total lifetime of the third crossing to be @xmath122  yr for a star of the mass and period of t  mon ( assuming solar metallicity ) .",
    "this implies that if the  nebula comprises mass loss on the instability strip , it must have occurred during the _ second _ crossing , whose duration is estimated to be @xmath12353,000  yr . ( the first crossing can be largely excluded based on its short lifetime of @xmath1233600  yr ) .",
    "based on bono et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the mass discrepancy for t  mon is @xmath124 assuming models that do not include core overshoot ( i.e. , using `` canonical masses '' ) , while for non - canonical masses , the discrepancy would increase slightly to @xmath125 .",
    "these values are of order 10% of the mass of the star .",
    "interestingly , this is within a factor of two of the mass we estimate for the nebula near the star ( @xmath101 ; section  [ tmon ] ) .    assuming this nebula indeed represents a circumstellar remnant , some fraction of its mass should have originated from material swept from the surrounding ism .",
    "if we make a crude estimate of that contribution by assuming the distance from the galactic plane is @xmath126  pc and the local ism number density is approximately @xmath127 ( loup et al .",
    "1993 ) , we find @xmath128  1.2  @xmath129 . assuming a geometric mean radius for the shell of 1.0  pc ( see section  [ tmon ] )",
    ", the measured atomic hydrogen mass therefore translates to a particle density @xmath1303.5  @xmath129 , or roughly three times the expected local density .",
    "thus it is plausible that as much as two - thirds of the shell mass ( @xmath131 ) may have had a mass - loss origin ",
    "an amount sufficient to reconcile a significant part of t  mon s mass discrepancy and to have an important impact on the evolutionary history of the star .    for a fiducial outflow speed of @xmath240  ( table  5",
    "; see also section  [ upperlimits ] ) , a lower limit to the expansion age of the t  mon nebula is @xmath224,000  yr . assuming that two - thirds of the mass of the nebula was shed from the star over a comparable period would imply a mass - loss rate of @xmath132  yr@xmath4 . on the other hand , if we take as an upper limit to the age of the nebula the time that t  mon has spent on the instability strip ( @xmath133  yr ; bono et al .",
    "2000 ) , this would translate to @xmath134  yr@xmath4 .",
    "the first of these two estimates is two orders of magnitude higher than the mass - loss rate estimated by gallenne et al .",
    "( 2013 ) based on the modeling of extended mid - ir emission [ @xmath135 yr@xmath4 , after scaling to our adopted distance ] .",
    "however , given that the observations of gallenne et al . sample material within only @xmath136 , the mass - loss rate derived by those authors reflects only very recent or ongoing mass loss . as described above ,  emission is only marginally detected at the position of t  mon itself ( see figures  [ fig : tmonmom0 ] and [ fig : tmonhispec ] , lower panel ) . using the same approach as for the three undetected stars in our sample ( section  [ upperlimits ] )",
    ", we may therefore place a 3@xmath83 upper limit on the _ current _ mass - loss rate for t  mon of @xmath137  yr@xmath4 .",
    "our observations are therefore not sensitive to ongoing mass loss at a rate comparable to that estimated by gallenne et al .",
    "regardless of the current mass - loss rate of t  mon , the location of the star relative to the  nebula implies that if the nebula is circumstellar in origin , then the star must have ceased losing mass for some period of time since the nebula s formation .",
    "combined , the new  data and previous mid - ir results of gallenne et al .",
    "( 2013 ) point to a scenario where t  mon may have undergone significant variations in its mass - loss rate over the past 25,000 years or more .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical predictions that such fluctuations will occur , particularly in long - period cepheids ( e.g. , neilson et al .",
    "2011 ) . indeed , as we have noted above",
    ", this disruption could have resulted from the star temporarily leaving the instability strip after its second crossing .    finally , it is also worth noting that t  mon , as well as @xmath9  cep , whose circumstellar material was detected in  by m12 , are both members of triple systems .",
    "the presence of a close companion ( as in the case of @xmath9  cep ) may affect the nature and intensity of mass - loss episodes .",
    "however , even companions at larger separations ( present in both cases ) may have an important effect on the physical properties of stellar ejecta ( mohamed & podsiadlowski 2012 ; anderson et al .",
    "while it is not possible to draw general conclusions based on a sample of only two stars , further theoretical modeling , in addition to observations of a larger sample of binary cepheids in  and other wavelengths sensitive to mass loss , could provide additional insights into the consequences of binarity .",
    "for the stars undetected in the  line , our new vla observations allow us to place new limits on the presence of circumstellar debris that may have been shed by these cepheids during periods of recent or ongoing mass loss .",
    "however , translating our measurements to quantitative upper limits that are useful for constraining the stellar mass - loss properties requires adopting some assumptions about the nature of cepheid outflows  a topic on which we have very few empirical constraints .    to our knowledge ,",
    "@xmath9  cep is only cepheid with a directly measured outflow velocity ( @xmath13835  ; m12 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath139 for @xmath9  cep is noteworthy in that it is significantly lower than the escape speed from the star , consistent with a general trend of @xmath140 that has been seen in other types of supergiants ( reimers 1977 ; holzer & macgregor 1985 ; judge & stencel 1991 ) .",
    "indeed , reimers ( 1977 ) found that for non - variable g and k supergiants , the stars roughly follow a relation of the form @xmath141 .",
    "this relationship also holds for stars of comparable spectral type in the sample of judge & stencel ( 1991 ) and reasonably agrees with the measured outflow speed for @xmath9  cep ( m12 ) , even though the underlying mass - loss mechanism may be quite different between pulsating and non - pulsating supergiants .",
    "lacking any further constraints on @xmath139 for cepheids , we adopt the empirical relation of reimers to estimate representative outflow velocities for our sample stars .",
    "these values are presented in table  5 .",
    "if we assume that the  linewidth for each star is approximately twice its outflow speed , we may now derive model - dependent limits on the quantity of circumstellar gas for the undetected stars .",

    "the present non - detection of @xmath0  gem , x  cyg , and rs  pup in the  line is therefore not in contradiction with the findings from the period change studies , and suggests that deeper  observations may yet uncover mass - loss signatures .",
    "furthermore , the mass - loss rate of cepheids are not expected to be constant , but rather may vary by up to several orders of magnitude as the stars evolve along the instability strip ( neilson et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this means that periods of intense mass loss ( @xmath160 yr@xmath4 ) may occur , particularly for longer period cepheids ( @xmath16115  days ; bhm - vitense & love 1994 ; deasy 1988 ; neilson & lester 2008 ) .",
    "while the mechanism for generating such intense mass loss is unclear , it is worth noting that because the crossing time of the instability strip is relatively short for cepheids with periods of @xmath215 - 30 days ( @xmath162  yr ; bono et al .",
    "2000 ) periods of intense mass - loss are likely to be required if stars in this period range ( including x  cyg and t  mon ) are to lose even a few per cent of their mass during the cepheid phase ( see section  [ discrep ] ) . for @xmath0  gem and rs  pup ,",
    "our present upper limits on the current mass - loss rates are inconsistent with mass loss of this magnitude during the past several thousand years , but for x  cyg or t  mon it can not be excluded ( see also section  [ tmondisc ] ) .      after scaling the upper limits to the circumstellar mass within a 0.5  pc radius around each star ( column  7 of table  5 ) by a factor of 1.4 to correct for the mass of he , it is of interest to compare the resulting masses with the stellar masses from table  1 .",
    "we find that for the three undetected stars , our limits on the mass of circumstellar matter correspond to @xmath1632 - 5% of the stellar mass .    while it is difficult to accurately estimate the mass discrepancy for any individual star owing to model uncertainties , statistically , discrepancies between pulsation and evolutionary masses average between 10 - 20% ( see section  [ intro ] ) .",

    "furthermore , our upper limits on the mean mass - loss rates over their lifetimes on the instability strip [ @xmath6 yr@xmath4 ] are consistent with mean mass loss rates derived from previous studies of the rate of period change of large samples of cepheids .",

    "an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity , such as could be achieved with next - generation interferometers , would be particularly valuable .",
