    "increasing the density of particles in granular materials causes them to undergo a transition from a fluid - like state , in which the particles can move relatively freely , to a jammed state , in which almost none of the particles can move  @xcite . in glasses , a similar transition occurs when the temperature is decreased @xcite . as the material nears the glass or jamming transition , the system s relaxation time increases dramatically , until it diverges at the critical point @xcite .",
    "the various kinetically - constrained models @xcite capture the essence of the glass or jamming transitions and there has been much recent activity on them .",
    "some of these models simulate the way that particles block each other s movement by requiring that a particle can move only if its neighbors satisfy some condition @xcite .",
    "other models add driving forces which simulate the resistance of jammed systems to external forces @xcite .",
    "in general , the system is coarse - grained to a lattice , and each site is in one of two states , @xmath6 or @xmath7 . in lattice - gas models a site in state @xmath7 represents a particle which may move to an adjacent vacant site , represented by state @xmath6 , if its local neighborhood satisfies some model - dependent rule . in spin - facilitated models state @xmath7 represents a high density region in granular systems and an inactive region in glasses , while state @xmath6 represents either a low density region or an active region in granular matter and glass - forming liquids respectively .",
    "a site can change its state from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and vice versa , with a temperature - dependent rate if the site s local neighborhood satisfies some model - dependent rule .    in this paper",
    "we consider the kob - andersen ( ka ) @xcite and fredrickson - andersen ( fa ) @xcite kinetically - constrained models on one- and two - dimensional square lattices . in the fa spin - facilitated model ,",
    "a site can change its state from @xmath6 to @xmath7 and vice versa if it has at least @xmath8 neighboring vacancies . in the ka lattice - gas model ,",
    "a particle needs at least @xmath8 adjacent vacancies before and after the move in order to move to a nearest neighbor vacant site .",
    "higher dimensional versions of these models with higher values of @xmath8 have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "the glass or jamming transitions result from cooperative dynamics , in the manner that particles are blocked by their neighbors , which in turn are blocked by their neighbors , and so on , such that in order for a single particle to move , many others need to move before it . the number of these  shells \" and their weight , represent the structural changes in the system as it nears the critical point , and they diverge at the critical point . in effect",
    ", they represent the minimal number of steps needed for a particle to move , which may be found by culling the shells iteratively . above the critical density , or equivalently below the critical temperature ,",
    "some of these shells can not be culled since the particles in them block each other .",
    "this culling process is the usual manner to check whether a system is jammed or not , because if no shells remain after the culling then all the particles may move and the system is not jammed .",
    "the culling time represents a length scale related to relaxation of the system @xcite .",
    "we note here that this length scale is not the only way to quantify the relation between the structure of the system and its dynamics @xcite , and it remains an open question which structural order parameter is a better choice .    in most previous works regarding the fa and ka models , the relaxation time was measured by the two - time density autocorrelation function @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the persistence function , defined as the fraction of particles that have not yet moved until time @xmath9 ( in lattice - gas models ) or the fraction of sites that have not changed state until time @xmath9 ( in spin - facilitated models ) .",
    "the persistence function was thoroughly investigated in the relatively simple @xmath10 models @xcite , but there are also works on higher values of @xmath8 @xcite , and other kinetically - constrained models @xcite .",
    "generally , the density autocorrelation function and the persistence function behave similarly .",
    "in this paper we study the relation between the culling time and the relaxation time , obtained from the persistence function , and show that near the critical point the relation is a model - dependent power law which can be explained as a diffusion of rare droplets .",
    "we show that this is a general result by also considering another kinetically - constrained model , the spiral model @xcite . in section [ secmodels ]",
    "we describe the models investigated in this paper .",
    "our results for the culling time and the relaxation time are shown in sections [ seccull ] and [ secpers ] respectively , and are compared in section [ seccomp ] .",
    "section [ secsum ] summarizes the paper .",
    "we consider the ka and fa models on a @xmath11-dimensional square lattice . at time @xmath12 , each site in the lattice is either in state @xmath7 with probability @xmath13 , or in state @xmath6 with probability @xmath14 without correlations between sites . in this way",

    "a particle needs at least @xmath8 adjacent vacancies before and after the move in order to move to a nearest neighbor vacant site .",
    "we consider here three cases : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the first two cases @xmath18 in the ka model are equivalent to the simple symmetric exclusion principle ( ssep ) model @xcite , in which a particle can move if it has a neighboring vacancy . when @xmath10 all the particles are able to move eventually ( in the ka mod el ) or change their state eventually ( in the fa model ) , while if @xmath19 there is a system - size - dependent value of the density above which a finite fraction of the particles will not be able to move ( ka model ) @xcite or change their state ( fa model ) @xcite . in square systems of size",
    "@xmath20 , this critical vacancy density is given by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a weak function of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "in the system sizes we consider here , @xmath24 , whereas in the limit @xmath25 it is equal to @xmath26 .",
    "we perform on these systems two types of dynamics : culling dynamics and real dynamics . in the culling dynamics ,",
    "we iteratively remove the particles which are able to move ( ka ) , or change to @xmath6 the state of the sites which are able to do so ( fa ) . in the real dynamics , every time step @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the number of sites , one of the sites is chosen randomly .    in the fa model , in order for a site to change its state , it first must have @xmath8 neighboring vacancies as noted before .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , the site changes its state from @xmath6 to @xmath7 with probability @xmath29 and from @xmath7 to @xmath6 with probability @xmath30 . in order to maintain detailed balance",
    "while maximizing the transition probabilities , we set @xmath31 in the ka model , if the chosen site is occupied , a random direction is also chosen , and the chosen particle can move in that direction if the neighboring site in that direction is empty , and the particle has at least @xmath8 neighboring vacancies before and after the move .    in the real dynamics , we use a continuous time , or rejection - free algorithm since at high densities the probability that an allowable move is randomly chosen is very small . in this algorithm",
    "we randomly generate the number of time steps that have passed between successive moves based on the probability that a move is possible . in this way",
    ", we do not wait for long periods of time until a move is made , but rather advance the clock in large random steps .    for the culling dynamics",
    "we define the culling time cumulative distribution @xmath32 as the fraction of sites that started in state @xmath7 and did nt change to @xmath6 until iteration @xmath33 of the culling process , and for the real dynamics we define the persistence function @xmath34 as the fraction of particles that have not yet moved ( ka ) or the fraction of sites that started from state @xmath7 and did not change to @xmath6 ( fa ) until time @xmath9 .",
    "obviously @xmath35 for all models .",
    "the culling time @xmath36 and the persistence time @xmath37 , defined respectively as the average number of iterations needed to cull a particle and the average time until a particle moves ( ka ) or a site changes its state ( fa ) for the first time , are given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 if the system is unjammed , i.e. that all of the sites ( particles ) will be able to flip ( move ) eventually , and @xmath40 if the system is jammed , i.e. that some of the sites ( particles ) will never be able to flip ( move ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath41 and @xmath42 act as the system s edwards - anderson order parameter @xcite . in the fa models ,",
    "flipping sites only to @xmath6 may occur in the real dynamics , albeit with a negligible probability , and thus @xmath43 .",
    "however , in the ka models it is possible that some particles will never be able to move but are still culled because other particles that may move but block them are culled , and thus @xmath44 .",
    "although the case @xmath45 is possible in finite systems , we assume that it does not occur in the thermodynamic limit since we encountered such a scen ario only in very small systems .",
