    "various experiments have now established that neutrinos have mass and mix with each other  @xcite .",
    "the masslessness of the neutrinos in the minimal standard model ( sm ) implies that one has to go beyond it to account for this observation . among a number of possibilities that have been proposed  @xcite ,",
    "the most popular are the seesaw scenarios in which new particles are introduced with masses sufficiently large to make the neutrino masses small .    in the so - called type - i and type - iii seesaw models",
    "@xcite , the heavy particles responsible for giving mass to the light neutrinos are neutral fermions , often referred to as heavy neutrinos . whether the seesaw mechanism can be probed at colliders",
    "crucially depends not only on the masses of the heavy neutrinos ( as well as their charged partners in the case of type iii ) , but also on the strength of their interactions with sm particles , specifically the mixing between the heavy neutrinos , @xmath1 , and the light ones ,  @xmath0 .    with only one generation of the neutrinos ,",
    "the size of this light - heavy mixing is of order the square root of their mass ratio ,  @xmath3 .",
    "since the light - neutrino mass must be less than an  ev or so , the mixing would be very small , less than @xmath4 even for @xmath5 of order  100gev .",
    "this would make it challenging to test the seesaw mechanism , especially in the type - i model , at colliders .",
    "however , in the presence of more than one generation of light and heavy neutrinos , there are circumstances in which the mixing can be much larger  @xcite , offering greater hope of observing its effects on various processes",
    ". the combination of such large mixing , with and the tiny light - neutrino masses can occur naturally if the underlying theory has some symmetry that is slightly broken  @xcite .",
    "a recent study  @xcite has explored this possibility of large light - heavy mixing further and considered specific examples in both seesaw scenarios of types  i and  iii .",
    "that study also examined some of the implications of the large light - heavy mixing for the single production of the heavy leptons at the lhc via channels such as @xmath6 and found that there are interesting prospects for detecting these heavy particles at the lhc .    in the present paper , we consider additional processes where it may be possible to probe the large - mixing effects .",
    "in particular , we apply some of the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for types - i and  -iii seesaw to the decays of the higgs boson into a light ordinary fermion plus one of the new heavy leptons .",
    "we show that , with the light - heavy mixing as large as allowed by currently available experimental data , some of these new decay modes of the higgs boson could give rise to sizable modifications of its decay branching ratios in the sm and therefore could significantly alter higgs searches at the lhc or other colliders . on  the other hand",
    ", the new decay modes could serve to open a window to the underlying seesaw mechanism if the higgs boson is discovered and its decay modes are well measured .",
    "in the type - i scenario , the seesaw mechanism is realized by introducing right - handed neutrinos that are singlets under the sm gauge groups and can therefore have large majorana masses  @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume for definiteness that there are three of these heavy neutrinos , @xmath7 , responsible for giving mass to the three left - handed light neutrinos ,  @xmath8 . the relevant lagrangian describing the masses of the neutrinos can be expressed as @xmath9 where summation over @xmath10 is implied , @xmath11 is the ( 3@xmath123 ) yukawa coupling matrix , @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the usual second pauli matrix and @xmath15 the higgs doublet , @xmath16  its vacuum expectation value , @xmath17 is the left - handed lepton doublet , @xmath18  is the majorana mass matrix , and @xmath19 denotes the charge conjugate of  @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting seesaw mass terms are given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are column matrices containing @xmath8 and @xmath23 , respectively , and @xmath24 with the dirac mass matrix @xmath25 .",
    "one can relate the weak eigenstates @xmath8 and @xmath19 to the corresponding mass eigenstates by writing @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are column matrices containing the mass eigenstates .",
    "thus @xmath29 is unitary and diagonalizes @xmath30 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 . on the other hand , the submatrices @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37",
    "are not unitary . assuming that the nonzero elements of @xmath38 are all much greater than those of @xmath39 , and expanding in terms of @xmath40 , one then finds to leading order that @xmath41 has small deviations from unitarity , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the reduced light - neutrino mass matrix @xmath45 , which can be diagonalized using the unitary pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix @xmath46  @xcite , @xmath47 .",
    "this leads to the leading - order relation @xmath48    in terms of the weak eigenstates , the neutrinos couple to the gauge and higgs bosons in the  sm according to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the usual weak coupling constant and @xmath51 . using the relations @xmath52 and @xmath53 derived from eq .",
    "( [ mdiag ] ) , one can rewrite @xmath54 in the mass - eigenstate basis as @xmath55 \\frac{h}{v } ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus via mixing the heavy neutrinos @xmath1 can interact with the sm gauge bosons at tree level .",
    "this lagrangian indicates that the higgs - boson coupling to a pair of light and heavy neutrinos , @xmath56 , is leading compared to the other higgs - neutrino couplings , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which are proportional to the tiny light - neutrino masses and of second order in  @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "this dominant coupling generates the decay mode @xmath2 if the mass of the heavy neutrino is less than the higgs mass  @xmath59 .",
    "clearly , how important this decay might be would depend on the elements of the matrix  @xmath35 , which parametrizes the light - heavy mixing .",
    "as we will show later , the elements of @xmath35 subject to current experimental constraints can be sufficiently sizable to give rise to significant modifications of the higgs decay branching ratios in the  sm for a  relatively light higgs - boson .      from eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) , we obtain the amplitude for @xmath60 @xmath61 v_n^ { } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 denote the @xmath64th mass - eigenstates of the light and heavy neutrinos , respectively , @xmath65 is the mass of @xmath63 , and @xmath66 . in deriving this expression ,",
    "we have made use of the majorana nature of both neutrinos and neglected contributions from terms in @xmath54 proportional to the light - neutrino masses .",
    "the resulting decay rate for all possible combinations of @xmath67 is @xmath68 with @xmath69 . for our numerical analysis",
    ", we will employ some of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite which provided specific solutions for @xmath35 having sizable elements and simultaneously satisfying the light - neutrino mass requirement given in eq .",
    "( [ umu ] ) .",
    "there are additional sets of constraints that the elements of @xmath35 must satisfy .",
    "the first arises from electroweak precision data on processes involving neutral currents conserving lepton flavor  @xcite . expressed in terms of @xmath70 , in type - i seesaw the bounds extracted from the data are  @xcite @xmath71 the second set of constraints come from lepton - flavor violating transitions in the charged - lepton sector .",
    "although in type - i seesaw there are no flavor - changing processes involving ordinary charged leptons at tree level , loop - induced ones can occur , such as the radiative decays @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the bounds determined from the measurements of such transitions are  @xcite @xmath75 finally , for @xmath1-mass values between a few gev and the @xmath76 mass , @xmath77 , there are also restrictions on the individual elements @xmath78 and @xmath79 from searches for sm - singlet neutrinos via @xmath80 performed by the l3 and delphi experiments at lep  @xcite",
    ". these constraints on @xmath81 may be stronger than those inferred from eqs .",
    "( [ eii ] ) and  ( [ eij ] ) , depending on  @xmath82 .    to explore the effect of large light - heavy mixing on the decay @xmath2",
    ", we take some of the examples of @xmath35 from ref .  @xcite .",
    "as discussed therein , the general form of @xmath35 which accommodates the large mixing can be written as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a rank - one matrix which makes the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ umu ] ) vanish exactly and @xmath85 denotes a perturbation matrix with tiny elements fixed to reproduce the light - neutrino masses according to eq .",
    "( [ umu ] ) .",
    "it follows that the elements of @xmath84 are not constrained by the light - neutrino masses and can be as large as allowed by the experimental bounds described in the preceding paragraph .",
    "we note that , as mentioned earlier , this situation can happen naturally in the presence of some underlying symmetry that is slightly violated  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , in our discussion below we include in @xmath35 only the dominant part ,  @xmath86 .",
    "thus , for the first example , we take  @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , with @xmath92 being a free parameter that has to satisfy the bounds listed above and @xmath5 taken to be the lightest of @xmath93 . from now on , for simplification we assume that the heavy neutrinos are degenerate , @xmath94 , the situation in the nondegenerate case being qualitatively similar , and so @xmath95 is a unit matrix in the following examples , but not explicitly displayed .",
    "we then obtain @xmath96 to be the largest value allowed by the experimental constraints . adopting this number , we plot in fig .",
    "[ ratio1](a ) the ratio of @xmath97 to the total higgs width @xmath98 in the sm corresponding to higgs mass values within the range @xmath99 for @xmath100  gev . from the curves displayed , the peak of the ratio is seen to be only about @xmath101 , corresponding to the @xmath102gev curve at @xmath103gev .",
    "we remark that for lower values of @xmath5 , from several to 60  gev , the lep searches mentioned earlier impose the strong limits @xmath104  @xcite .     in type - i seesaw to the total higgs width in the sm as functions of the higgs mass @xmath59 for heavy - neutrino mass values @xmath100  gev and different choices of @xmath105 as described in the text.[ratio1],width=634 ]    as a second example",
    ", we can choose  @xcite @xmath106 with @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is a free parameter subject to the experimental constraints .",
    "we find that the maximum allowed value @xmath111 leads to a graph very similar to that in fig .",
    "[ ratio1](a ) .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath105 in either eq .",
    "( [ u0a ] ) or  ( [ u0d ] ) automatically satisfies the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ ee0nu ] ) for degenerate heavy neutrinos .",
    "it is evident that the effect of light - heavy mixing on @xmath2 in the preceding examples is not remarkable .",
    "this is mainly because of the strict bound on @xmath112 in eq .",
    "( [ eij ] ) which limits the elements of @xmath105 to be at most  @xmath1130.01 in size .",
    "it turns out that there are other choices of  @xmath105 which can evade this restriction , one of them being  @xcite @xmath114 with @xmath115 .",
    "we obtain the largest allowed value of @xmath116 to be @xmath117 for @xmath118gev , but @xmath119 for @xmath102gev from the lep searches  @xcite .",
    "these numbers lead to @xmath2 rates which are much larger than those in the earlier examples , and the ratios of these enlarged rates to the sm higgs total width are shown in fig .",
    "[ ratio1](b ) .",
    "more precisely , one observes from the four curves displayed that the ratio can reach as high as 28% , which corresponds to the peak of the @xmath120gev curve at @xmath121gev .",
    "another choice that can evade the @xmath112 constraint is  @xcite @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124  ( 0.039 ) for @xmath102gev  @xmath125gev ) .",
    "this results in a plot very similar to that in fig .",
    "[ ratio1](b ) .    since the light - heavy mixing also causes the @xmath76 coupling to @xmath126 , according to eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) , the decay @xmath80 can happen for @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , it is important to check if the impact on @xmath80 from the large mixing we are considering is consistent with the precisely measured value of the @xmath76 total - width , @xmath128gev  @xcite , which agrees with the standard - model prediction @xmath129gev  @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) , one derives the amplitude @xmath130 v_n^ { } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] upon using the majorana nature of the neutrinos .",
    "one then gets the decay rate @xmath131 with @xmath69 as before .",
    "numerically , the choices @xmath132 and @xmath133 producing the largest effects obtained above yield nearly identical rates : @xmath134 , 0.16 , and 0.002  mev for @xmath102 , 80 , and 90  gev , respectively . obviously , each of these @xmath135 numbers is well within the errors in @xmath136 and  @xmath137 .",
    "this helps to confirm that our parameter choices for @xmath35 already satisfied the lep and other constraints described earlier in this subsection .",
    "we have thus demonstrated that , with the large light - heavy mixing subject to current experimental constraints , the new decay mode @xmath2 can change the total higgs width in the sm by up to nearly 30% for a relatively light higgs - boson , especially with @xmath162gev .",
    "this would significantly affect the sm expectations in higgs searches at the lhc . for bigger higgs masses , @xmath163 ,",
    "as the decay channels into a pair of weak gauge bosons , @xmath164 , become open and start to be dominant , the effect of @xmath2 due to the large mixing on the higgs total width would get much reduced , as can be seen also from fig .",
    "[ ratio1 ] .",
    "we can mention here that the possibility of @xmath2 causing important changes to higgs searches in the presence of the large mixing has also been raised previously in ref .",
    "@xcite which proposed radiatively induced neutrino masses and more recently in ref .",
    "@xcite in the contexts of other models of light - neutrino mass generation .",
    "since @xmath2 is a potentially influential decay mode , it is of interest as well to study the subsequent decays of @xmath1 in the case of large light - heavy mixing .",
    "they may have signatures which are observable and distinguishable from those of the  sm .",
    "we explore this possibility in the rest of this section .",

    "we can then determine how far @xmath1 is likely to travel after being produced in the higgs decay @xmath2 and before decaying in the rest frame of  @xmath169 , once @xmath59 is specified .",
    "we have found that in this case the largest distance traveled by @xmath1 is less than @xmath170 m for the @xmath59 values considered here , namely @xmath99 .",
    "more specifically , in the rest frame of the decaying higgs boson , the most energetic and longest - lived @xmath1 corresponds to @xmath171gev , @xmath102gev , and @xmath172kev , as table  [ rates ] indicates , and its maximum distance is calculated to be @xmath173 m .",
    "these considerations imply that the decay @xmath2 is very quickly followed by @xmath1 decaying into three light fermions , and hence this decay sequence is effectively a four - body higgs decay , @xmath174 , each @xmath175 being a light fermion .",

    "<S> in seesaw models with more than one generation of light and heavy neutrinos , @xmath0  and  @xmath1 , respectively , it is possible to have sizable mixing between them for heavy - neutrino masses of order 100gev or less . </S>",
    "<S> we explore this possibility further , taking into account current experimental constraints , and study its effect on higgs - boson decays in the contexts of seesaw models of types  i and  iii . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in the type - i case the higgs decay into a pair of light and heavy neutrinos , @xmath2 , could increase the total higgs width in the standard model by up to almost 30% for a relatively light higgs - boson , which would significantly affect higgs searches at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent prompt decay of @xmath1 into three light fermions makes this higgs decay effectively a four - body decay . </S>",
    "<S> we further find that , in the presence of the large light - heavy mixing , these four - body higgs decays can have rates a few times larger than their standard - model counterparts and therefore could provide a  potentially important window to reveal the underlying seesaw mechanism . </S>"
