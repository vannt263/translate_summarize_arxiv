    "the frequency of disks harboring stars within a young embedded cluster , the disk fraction , has been studied for many clusters of various ages as an indicator of the disk lifetime @xcite .",
    "the most common means of estimating the disk fraction is the detection of infrared emission from warm and hot dust ( typically a few 100 to 1500k ) in the inner part of the disk ( within a stellocentric distance of @xmath01au ) @xcite with wavelengths of 224@xmath4 m using @xmath5-band ( 2.2@xmath4 m ) @xcite , @xmath6-band ( 3.5@xmath4 m ) @xcite , and _ spitzer irac _",

    "the disk fraction was found to decrease as a function of age , showing that the inner disk lifetime is about 510myr for nearby embedded clusters with the solar metallicity . because ( sub-)mm continuum observations of cold dust ( @xmath010k ) in the outer disk ( @xmath750au ) correlate very well with observations of inner dust disks @xcite , the entire disk , from 0.1 to 100 au , is thought to be dispersed almost simultaneously ( within @xmath0@xmath8yr ) .",
    "therefore , the lifetime of the entire disk is also thought to be 510myrs .",
    "the disk lifetime in a low - metallicity environment is of special interest because of the discovery that the probability of a star hosting a planet increases with stellar metallicity (  planet - metallicity correlation  ) @xcite .",
    "however , the disk lifetime in an environment with lower metallicity than the solar neighborhood has not been studied . by directly studying the disk lifetime in the eog",
    ", it may be possible to obtain clues to the mechanism of this `` planet - metallicity correlation . ''",
    "although the disk fraction has been studied for a low - metallicity ( [ o / h]@xmath9@xmath10 ) @xcite star - forming cluster , 30 doradus , in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite , the target stars were limited to only very massive ones ( @xmath020@xmath11 ) because of the limited sensitivity and spatial resolution for this extragalactic cluster .",
    "because the eog is much closer than nearby dwarf galaxies , it allows us to obtain accurate disk fractions in a low - metallicity environment to @xmath00.3@xmath11 , which is below the characteristic peak of imf @xcite .",
    "this mass detection limit corresponds to the lowest mass of the target stars for the planet - metallicity correlation ( e.g. , fgk - type stars ) @xcite and is therefore critical for understanding the correlation .",
    "our targets , the digel cloud 2 clusters @xcite are among the most distant embedded clusters in the eog at @xmath12kpc .",
    "they are located in a giant molecular cloud , cloud 2 , one of the most distant molecular clouds in the eog @xcite .",
    "the metallicity [ o / h ] of cloud 2 is measured at @xmath13dex from the radio molecular emission lines @xcite , which is comparable to that of lmc ( @xmath0@xmath10dex ) and small magellanic cloud ( smc ; @xmath0@xmath140.9dex ) @xcite .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio in cloud 2 was estimated to be as low as 0.001 from a submm continuum observation @xcite .",
    "this is about 10 times smaller than in the solar neighborhood , and is consistent with the metallicity . because the cloud 2 clusters are much closer ( @xmath15kpc ) than lmc / smc ( @xmath16kpc ) , they are quite suitable for the study of the disk fraction in a low - metallicity environment .",
    "their youth ( most likely age of @xmath00.5myr ) @xcite adds an advantage to the present study because any variation in disk fraction should be most clearly seen when the disk fraction value is near its maximum . because the eog is located at the large heliocentric distance of @xmath010kpc , high sensitivity and high spatial resolution is necessary for the present study .",
    "deep @xmath17-band images of cloud 2 clusters were obtained on september 2 , 2006 with an exposure time of @xmath18600sec for each band with the 8.2-m subaru telescope equipped with a wide - field nir camera , moircs @xcite .",

    "2 ) in both @xmath36 and @xmath37 bands .    considering the very large @xmath38 of the cloud 2 clusters ( @xmath39kpc ) , contamination of background stars is negligible and most of the field objects are foreground stars ( some are background galaxies ) . to quantify the contamination by foreground stars , we compared the @xmath31 distributions of all the sources in the cluster regions and the field objects outside the cluster regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : av ] ) .",
    "because the number of field objects decreases significantly at @xmath40mag , most cluster members can be distinguished from the field objects as red sources with @xmath41mag .",
    "the contamination by the foreground stars are estimated by counting the field objects in the tail of the distribution at @xmath41mag and divide it with the total number of the sources in the cluster regions : @xmath020% and @xmath02% for the cloud 2-n and 2-s clusters , respectively .",
    "note that the contamination is very small for the s cluster because of the smaller area of the cluster region .",
    "although there must be some cluster members at @xmath42 that missed our identification , the number of such sources should not be significant in view of the geometry of the molecular clouds , which are in front of the clusters ( yasui et al .",

    "we derived disk fractions of the cloud 2 clusters using a _ j - h _ vs. _ h - k _ color - color diagram for the identified cluster members ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colcolns ] ) . stars with circumstellar dust disks are known to show a large @xmath43 color excess @xcite . on the @xmath20 color - color diagram ,",
    "stars without circumstellar disks are seen as main - sequence stars reddened with extinction , while stars with circumstellar disks are seen in `` the disk excess region '' ( to the right of the dot - dashed line in ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colcolns ] ) because of thermal emission from hot dust disk with a temperature of 10001500k . for the cloud 2-n and 2-s",
    "clusters , the disk fractions are 9@xmath444 % @xmath45 and 27@xmath447 % @xmath46 , respectively , where the ratio of stars with excess to the total number of stars is given in parentheses . the uncertainty of the disk fractions is estimated only from the poisson errors because photometric errors are quite small with the median errors of 0.06mag for ( @xmath43 ) and ( @xmath47 ) @xcite .",
    "given the possible systematic uncertainty , we can not say at this stage if the difference between the disk fractions of the cloud 2-n and 2-s is significant .",
    "because the above - discussed contamination from the foreground objects of @xmath48 mag may decrease the disk fraction , the actual disk fractions could be higher than the derived values here .",
    "however , the amount of the increase is estimated as @xmath492.2% and @xmath490.5% for the cloud 2-n and -s clusters , respectively , when reducing the total number of the identified cluster members ( 52 and 59 for the n and s clusters , respectively ) by the estimated number of contaminated foreground objects ( @xmath010 and @xmath01 for the n and s clusters , respectively ) . because this maximum possible increase of the disk fraction is well within the large poisson uncertainty ( 4% and 7% for the cloud 2-n and 2-s clusters , respectively ) ,",
    "we conclude that the effect of the background contamination on the disk fraction is small .",
    "in addition , in the case where we assume that all stars in the cluster regions are cluster members , the disk fractions for the cloud 2-n and 2-s cluster become 6% ( 5/89 ) and 21% ( 16/78 ) , respectively . even in this extreme case ,",
    "the amounts of the decrease ( @xmath50% for the cloud 2-n cluster and @xmath51% for the 2-s cluster ) are again within the poisson errors .",
    "to confirm the negligible effect of the photometric errors , we estimated disk fractions of two extreme cases : one case is that ( @xmath47 ) and ( @xmath43 ) colors of all stars were systematically changed within the photometric uncertainties of each source to get the lowest disk fraction and the other case to get the highest disk fraction . assuming a gaussian distribution of the photometric errors , the probability that the color of a star is within the @xmath441@xmath23 offset is 68% and the probability that the color of a star is redder than the 1@xmath23 offset is about 16% ( @xmath52 ) . because the cloud 2 clusters have about 50 members , the probability that _ all _ stars have redder colors than the 1@xmath23 offset is @xmath53 , which is essentially zero .",
    "if we assume that the probability distribution of disk fraction is gaussian , the estimated disk fraction of the extreme case ( probability 0.16@xmath54 ) should have a probability less than the 3 sigma case ( 0.1% ) . in the above extreme case ( all the sources have @xmath55 or @xmath56 redder colors )",
    ", we found that the disk fraction increases from 9% to 19% ( n cluster ) and from 27% to 44% ( s cluster ) .",
    "since such an extreme case only occurs with a probability of @xmath57 , much less than a 3 sigma occurrence , we consider that the 1@xmath23 photometric uncertainty must be much less than 3% ( @xmath58 ) and 6% ( @xmath59 ) for the cloud 2-n and 2-s clusters , respectively , which is smaller than the poisson errors .    in view of the low - metallicity environment of the eog",
    ", there might be some fundamental differences between the clusters in the solar neighborhood and in the eog , such as the reddening and the stellar mass distributions , that may require different treatments of the disk fraction estimation . in our earlier paper , we confirmed that the reddening vector as well as the main - sequence track on the color - color diagram does not change with metallicity down to the metallicity of the cloud 2 ( yasui et al .",
    "2008 , section  4 ) . also , the stellar mass distributions of the cloud clusters are suggested to follow the universal imf , which is widely observed in the solar neighborhood ( yasui et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the use of the same division of with / without disk as for the solar neighborhood is appropriate . as for the treatment of the different filter systems ,",
    "see yasui et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for the detail .",
    "we derived the @xmath20 disk fraction of various embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood using the photometry data in the literature ( table  1 and fig .",
    "[ fig : dfcl2 ] ) .",
    "we chose publications with the following criteria : i ) @xmath20 photometry data of cluster members are available in order to estimate disk fractions in the same way as for our data , ii ) the mass detection limit is @xmath601@xmath30 @xcite , iii ) all data in each embedded cluster are estimated in the same filter system .",
    "for all clusters we used the classical dwarf track in the johnson - glass system @xcite and a reddening vector in the arizona system @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 disk fractions were estimated in the same way as for the cloud 2 clusters : the border line , which determines whether a star has a disk or does nt have a disk , passes through the point of m6 type stars in the dwarf track on the color - color diagram .",
    "recent disk fraction studies often use @xmath61 data because thermal infrared ( @xmath62@xmath63 m ) can trace the colder ( thus , outer ) disk , and disk fractions from @xmath61 data are thought to be a more robust signature of the circumstellar disk than those only from @xmath20 data @xcite",
    ". however , disk fractions from only @xmath20 data are about 0.6 of those from @xmath61 data with slightly more scatter on the disk fraction - age plot , and the estimated disk lifetime from @xmath20 data is basically identical to that from @xmath61 data . therefore , despite a little larger uncertainty , the disk fraction from only @xmath20 data should still be effective even without thermal ir data . since the detection sensitivity in the thermal infrared is still not enough for the distant clusters like those in the eog , we can make use of the high detection sensitivity at @xmath20 wavelengths to estimate the disk lifetime for the eog clusters .",
    "we show the disk fractions of the cloud 2 clusters , as well as of the derived disk fraction of seven embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood , in the disk fraction - age diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dfcl2 ] ; see @xmath64  [ sec : jhk_df ] ) .",
    "the disk fractions of the cloud 2-n and 2-s clusters are significantly lower than nearby embedded clusters of similar age . as discussed in section [ sec : diskfraction ] , the contamination from the foreground objects and the possible unidentified cluster members have only a small effect on the estimated disk fraction .",
    "although the difference between the filter system for our data ( mko ) and the data in the literature might cause some systematic offset for the disk fraction value , we confirmed that the disk fraction does not depend on the choice of the filter system by confirming that the disk fraction of a good reference cluster ( ngc 2024 cluster ) is identical for both cit and mko systems ( see appendix  a ) .",
    "given the importance of the age of the clusters to the above conclusion , here we discuss the uncertainties of the age and the age spread of the clusters .",
    "considering the imf derived from @xmath5-band luminosity function ( klf ) , the age of the cloud 2 clusters should be less than 2myr : the klf fitting shows an unrealistic top - heavy imf with the age of 2myr @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conservatively estimate that the age upper - limit of the cloud 2 clusters is 1myr .",
    "moreover , the suggested supernovae triggered star formation of the cloud 2 clusters @xcite suggests the age of 0.4myr , which strongly supports the above estimate from the klf . because there is no spectroscopic study of the cluster members ,",
    "there is no observed age spread information as for the nearby clusters as in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "because the mean age of this cluster is estimated as @xmath00.5myr , the age spread should be smaller down to @xmath440.5myr as assumed in the young cluster model in muench et al .",
    "muench et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimated the age of the trapezium cluster at 0.8@xmath440.6myr .",
    "palla & stahler ( 2000 ) actually obtained smaller age spread for the youngest embedded clusters ( rho oph , onc ) .",
    "moreover , in the above triggered star formation picture ( kobayashi et al .",
    "2008 ) , the age spread of the cloud 2 clusters should be small because of the single triggering mechanism at a certain time .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the most likely age of the clusters is 0.5myr and no more than 1myr . even if we consider the possible age range , the estimated disk fractions are still quite low compared with those in the solar neighborhood .",
    "although the cloud 2 clusters appear to be quite close on the sky , they are totally independent clusters with a projected distance of @xmath025pc at the heliocentric distance of @xmath65kpc @xcite . if they were located at the same heliocentric distance as the orion dark cloud ( @xmath66pc ) , the angular separation between the clusters becomes @xmath67 , which is larger than @xmath68 between two independent clusters , e.g. , ngc 2024 and ngc 2071 clusters , listed in the previous study of @xmath20 disk fraction @xcite . because the measured disk fractions for two _ independent _ clusters were similarly low , the disk fractions of embedded clusters in the low - metallicity environment",
    "are inferred to be universally low , at least in the eog . in combination with the fact that _ there are no very young ( @xmath11myr ) embedded clusters of solar metallicity whose disk fractions are this low _",
    ", our results strongly suggest that disk fraction depends strongly on metallicity .",
    "the most simple interpretations of the low disk fraction are that the disk is optically thin either because of the collisional agglomeration of dust grains in the disk @xcite or because of the low dust - to - gas ratio due to the low metallicity .",
    "however , the former is unlikely because the probability of dust collision , which is proportional to the square of dust density , should be rather low in the low - metallicity environment .",
    "the latter is also unlikely because the inner disk should be optically thick even with a metallicity of @xmath3dex : opacity of the disk with the wavelength of 2@xmath63 m ( @xmath69[hz ] ) at 0.1au is estimated to be @xmath010@xmath70 , assuming a minimum mass solar nebula ( surface gas density of @xmath95@xmath7110@xmath72g@xmath73@xmath74 at 0.1au ) @xcite and a standard power - law opacity coefficient @xmath75 ( @xmath915 ; @xmath76})$]@xmath74g@xmath77 ) @xcite , and considering the dust - to - gas ratio of 0.001 @xcite , which is 1/10 smaller than in the solar metallicity .",
    "if we assume that the typical disk - to - star mass ratio ( 0.01 ; e.g. , andrews & williams 2005 , natta et al .",
    "2006 ) , we would expect the total disk mass of @xmath78@xmath30 for the lowest - mass stars in our sample ( @xmath79@xmath30 ) . because this is roughly one - tenth that of the minimum mass solar nebulae ( 0.010.02@xmath30 )",
    ", we still expect a very large optical thickness of @xmath0@xmath80 at k - band , assuming that disk mass measured in the submm correlates directly with surface density in the inner regions .",
    "this assumption is used for disks in the solar metallicity environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even if we assume the lowest observed disk - to - star mass ratio in the nearby star forming regions ( @xmath0@xmath81",
    "; andrews & williams 2005 ) , the expected optical thickness is still @xmath0@xmath82 .",
    "model spectral energy distributions with various disk mass do not show a significantly different @xmath43 color excess ( less than 0.05 mag ) even if the amount of dust disks decreased to @xmath83 @xcite , which correspond to the dust - to - gas ratio of @xmath00.001 in the eog .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the small disk fraction implies that the inner region of the disk is cleared out .",
    "note that optically thickness does not necessarily mean the existence of observable @xmath43 excess for lowest - mass stars with low effective temperature ( @xmath03000k ) and with very low disk mass of @xmath78@xmath84@xmath30 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "because the lowest mass stars of our samples ( @xmath00.1@xmath30 ) are m6-type stars with an effective temperature ( @xmath85 ) of @xmath03000k ( see e.g. , fig .  7 bottom figure in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it may be inevitable that some lowest - mass stars in our sample do not have detectable @xmath43 excess simply because of the less dust content under low - metallicity , thus contributing to the low disk fraction artificially . to investigate this effect , we made a plot of the disk fraction of the cloud 2 clusters for all sources brighter than certain @xmath5-band magnitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dfmag ] ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the disk fractions stay almost flat at the low level and do not _ decrease _ even including the m stars of the faintest magnitudes ( @xmath86 ) that may lower the disk fraction as described above .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the disk fraction is genuinely low for all sources down to the mass detection limit and that clearing out of the inner region of the disk is the reason for it . for the above arguments , we note two related studies .",
    "one is the detailed disk fraction study of the trapezium cluster by @xcite , who show that even for the latest m - type stars ( e.g. , m9-type stars , @xmath00.02@xmath30 , @xmath87k at 1myr ) has detectable @xmath43 excess and the @xmath20 disk fraction does not change even including the stars of this low - mass . in view of the youth of the cloud 2 clusters ( @xmath00.5myr ) that is similar to the trapezium cluster",
    ", we would naively expect similar detectable k - band excess even for the lowest mass stars in our sample ( @xmath00.1@xmath30 , m6-type stars ) with @xmath88k even with the low metallicity .",
    "also , in the simulation by @xcite , a detectable @xmath43 excess is seen even with very small disk mass of @xmath89@xmath30 under solar metallicity ( which corresponds to @xmath90@xmath30 with the metallicity of cloud2 ) , assuming a central source with 0.6@xmath30 and @xmath91k .    why does the inner region of the disk becomes cleared out effectively with lower metallicity ? there are two well - known mechanisms that can clear the inner disk : dust sublimation @xcite and the x - wind model @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we discuss if these mechanisms can effectively work with lower metallicity . _",
    "i ) dust sublimation : _ since dust sublimation typically occurs around 1500k , the very inner part of the disk with @xmath921500k becomes dust - free .",
    "the dust sublimation radius , @xmath93 , is described approximately as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is stellar luminosity , @xmath96 ( @xmath01500k ) is disk temperature at inner disk radius ( @xmath93 ) , and @xmath23 is the stefan - boltzmann constant @xcite . however , because the inner disk is expected to be optically thick even with the low metallicity of @xmath3dex , the temperature distribution inside the disk for @xmath3dex should not differ from that for the solar metallicity ( 0dex ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath93 is not expected to be significantly larger in the lower - metallicity environment . _",
    "ii ) x - wind model : _ due to the interaction between the stellar magnetic field with the accretion disk , the gas disk is thought to be truncated at an inner radius of @xmath97 @xcite , where @xmath98 is the star s mass , @xmath99 is the disk accretion rate , @xmath100 is magnetic dipole moment , @xmath101 is a dimensionless number of order unity , and @xmath102 is the gravitational constant . among these parameters determining @xmath103 ,",
    "only the disk accretion rate , @xmath99 depends on metallicity .",
    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) , which is the most likely cause for disk accretion @xcite , largely depends on the ionization of the gas disk by galactic cosmic rays @xcite , x - rays from the central young star @xcite , and thermal ionization @xcite . in a low - metallicity environment , we can expect that the ionization fraction increases and that the dead zone , which is the mri inactive region of the disk ( gammie 1996 ) , shrinks because the recombination on grain surfaces is reduced . as a result , @xmath99 increases and @xmath103 decreases .",
    "in fact , @xcite suggested that the dead zone shrinks in the case that the dust sedimentation of dust grain proceeds , which mimics the case in the low - metallicity . on the other hand",
    ", low - metallicity also means fewer molecular ions , which would reduce the ionization fraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus would reduce @xmath99 .",
    "which process dominates in the low metallicity environment has not been determined conclusively since the combination of many physical processes determine the size of the dead zone ( e.g , fromang , terquem , & balbus 2002 ) .",
    "however , the former process , thus larger @xmath99 , may dominate ( t. sano , t. suzuki , f. shu , private communication ) .",
    "although further theoretical studies are necessary to have a firm conclusion , we would naively expect that @xmath103 is not significantly larger in a lower - metallicity environment , and it appears that there is no theoretical reason to suspect that lower metallicity would make disks less detectable through the h - k excess . the lower dust level would still result in an optically thick inner edge and the size of the cleared out inner region should not change significantly with the metallicity .",
    "therefore , our observations can simply be interpreted that the inner disk ( gas and dust ) is mostly absent in cloud 2-n and 2-s .",
    "the above arguments lead to the suggestion that _ the initial disk fraction ( age @xmath104 0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dfcl2 ] ) in the low - metallicity environment of our targets is expected to be as high as that for the solar metallicity case _ , assuming that the distribution of initial disk properties is exactly the same regardless of metallicity .",
    "although this assumption is not obvious and more detailed observations of the disks in the extreme outer galaxy are needed , it is not an unreasonable assumption because the star formation process from gas to stars do not seem to significantly change for the metallicity of the cloud 2 clusters , for example , in view of the universal imf throughout various physical / chemical environments ( e.g. , elmegreen et al . 2008 , see omukai et al .",
    "2000 for theoretical study ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the significant decrease of the disk fraction in fig .  [ fig : dfcl2 ] is a result of the much shorter lifetime ( @xmath01myr ) of the inner disk in the low - metallicity environment compared to that in the solar metallicity environment , 56myr from @xmath20 disk fraction ( @xmath64  [ sec : jhk_df ] , * ? ? ?",
    "this can be expressed with the rapid decrease of the disk fraction as shown with the red thick line in fig .",
    "[ fig : dfcl2 ] .    we know that the entire circumstellar disk , both the inner and outer disks , dissipates almost simultaneously in the solar metallicity environment because the submillimeter detection fraction and the fraction of objects with a nir excess are identical @xcite , and also because the observed fraction of transition objects , between the class ii and class iii states , is very low @xcite",
    "therefore , we suggest that the _ entire _ disk dispersal is also rapid in the low - metallicity environment . the distributions of ( _ h_@xmath14_k _ ) excess in the cloud 2 clusters , which are consistent with those of more evolved ( @xmath05myr ) embedded clusters with solar metallicity , also support the above idea , though other mechanisms might cause the formation of the similar @xmath105@xmath14@xmath106 distributions .",
    "we constructed intrinsic @xmath43 color distributions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hkdist ] ) for cloud 2 clusters and nearby embedded clusters ( table  1 ) .",
    "the intrinsic @xmath107 colors of each star were estimated by dereddening along the reddening vector to the young star locus in the color - color diagram ( see fig .  [",

    "the young star locus was approximated by the extension of the ctts locus ( gray lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : colcolns ] ) , and only stars that are above the ctts locus were used . for the cloud 2 clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hkdist ] , top ) , the ctts locus in the mko system @xcite was used , while for the nearby clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hkdist ] , bottom ) , the original ctts locus in the cit system @xcite was used . to make the figure clearer",
    ", we show the color distributions for only ngc 2024 @xcite , taurus @xcite , and ic 348 @xcite , which have significantly different disk fractions .",
    "it is clearly seen that the distribution becomes bluer and sharper with lower disk fractions .",
    "the distributions of the cloud 2 clusters resemble that of ic 348 , whose disk fraction is as low as the cloud 2 clusters ( @xmath020% ) .      as the mechanism of disk dispersal ,",
    "two possibilities are known : ( i ) disk accretion @xcite , and ( ii ) photoevaporation of the surface layer of the gas disk due to extreme - ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation from the central star and/or the external radiation field @xcite . in the low metallicity environment",
    ", both possibilities may work effectively .",
    "first , the disk accretion rate may increase in the low - metallicity as discussed in @xmath64  [ sec : why_lowdf ] , if the increase of the ionization fraction due to less dust is larger than the decrease of the ionization fraction due to less molecular ions .",
    "this could be the reason for the rapid disk dispersal .",
    "secondly , the photoevaporation process may also work effectively to shorten the disk lifetime .",
    "because the euv photoevaporation is solely based on the strmgren condition of the hydrogen gas , metallicity ( or dust - to - gas ratio ) should not affect the rate of the photoevaporation mass - loss .",
    "however , the recent theoretical work @xcite shows that far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) or x - ray radiation is more effective than euv to photoevaporate the disk .",
    "because fuv penetration strongly depends on the amount of dust in the disk , they found that the disk lifetime decreases with the dust opacity .",
    "although the dust opacity dependence of the disk lifetime is not strong ( factor of @xmath02 changes with the dust opacity change of 10 ) , they noted that the results are still in a preliminary stage and has to wait further detailed modeling .",
    "therefore , this could be also the reason for the rapid disk dispersal in low - metallicity .",
    "in addition , something specific to the eog environment might be the reason ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but obviously further studies are necessary to pin down the physics of this phenomena .",
    "if the lifetimes of disks at the solar metallicity ( @xmath108 } \\sim 0 $ ] ) and at the low - metallicity ( @xmath108 } \\sim -0.7 $ ] ) are approximated as 5myr and 1myr , respectively , our results suggest that the disk lifetime strongly depends on the metallicity ( z @xmath109 [ m / h ] ) with a @xmath110 dependence .",
    "because the disk lifetime ( @xmath111 ) is directly connected to the planet formation probability ( p@xmath112 ) , the strong metallicity dependence of @xmath111 may create a similarly strong metallicity dependence of p@xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the disk dispersal could be one of the major driving mechanisms for the planet - metallicity correlation , which shows a strong sharp ( @xmath113 ) metallicity dependence ( fischer et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the current standard core nucleated accretion model of the giant planet formation ( e.g. ,",
    "see a review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the planet formation time scale is determined both by the core growth time and the gas accretion time onto the core . since the first study by safronov ( 1969 ) , core growth time in the giant planet zone has been thought to be far longer than the observed @xmath111 .",
    "but , after the discovery that @xmath111 is less than 10myr , it is widely accepted that giant planet cores must form via rapid runaway growth @xcite and oligarchic growth @xcite , which can grow the cores for the giant planet ( 510@xmath114 ) at the outer disk ( 5au ) in a reasonable time , e.g , 10myr .",
    "because this growth time is comparable to @xmath111 , the variation of @xmath115 due to the metallicity around this timescale may cause a strong metallicity dependence of the planet formation probability , @xmath116 , thus contributing to the planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "as far as we know , a deterministic model based on the core - accretion model by ida & lin ( 2004 ) is the only study that quantitatively estimates the effect of @xmath111 variation on @xmath116 .",
    "they show that the planet formation probability decreases with decreasing @xmath111 ( see their fig.2 ( b ) ) .",
    "however , the amount of decrease is only a factor of 24 with a factor of 10 change in the disk lifetime : the dependence is more like @xmath117 and is not a strong function of @xmath111 . if this is the case , our suggestion that @xmath118 means the disk dispersal can contribute to the planet - metallicity correlation by a factor of @xmath119 .",
    "@xcite show that the core - accretion model can qualitatively explain the planet - metallicity relation , but also note that the suggested metallicity dependence is not as strong as the observed relation : it is more like @xmath110 dependence judging from their fig .  2 ( b ) .",
    "therefore , by adding the contribution from the disk dispersal ( @xmath120 ) , most of the observed metallicity dependence of the planet formation probability ( @xmath121 ) can be reasonably explained .",
    "however , a quantitative argument is difficult at this stage because there are ambiguities and complexities in the planet formation models , and thus the planet - formation time scale .",
    "note that other groups are trying to reproduce the steep metallicity dependence by introducing a critical solid mass @xcite for the core accretion model .    while the planet - metallicity correlation appears to be clear in fischer s systematic work @xcite , udry & santos suggest that the correlation in low - metallicity range ( [ fe / h ] @xmath122 ) may be relatively weak @xcite .",
    "santos suggests that the planet formation mechanism could be different for the two metallicity ranges : core - accretion for the high - metallicity range and disk instability for the low - metallicity range @xcite .",
    "because our results seem to qualitatively explain a significant part of the 10@xmath123 dependence of the planet - metallicity relation , we assume that the dependence also holds true in the low - metallicity range ( [ fe / h ] @xmath2 0 ) , where we made our observations .",
    "however , the core - accretion model may not be able to explain the existence of planets around the low - metallicity stars with such short disk lifetime .",
    "we present deep imaging of two low - metallicity star forming regions in the eog , digel cloud 2-n and cloud 2-s .    1 .",
    "the fraction of young stars with disks is found to be 9@xmath444% for cloud 2-n and 27@xmath447% for cloud 2-s .",
    "previous works have shown that the age of these clusters is only approximately 0.5myr , and therefore the disk fraction is much lower than expected compared to the disk fraction measured for nearby star forming regions .",
    "2 .   various possibilities for the reason for the low disk fraction are investigated .",
    "we suggest that the simple reduction of the dust - to - gas ratio can not explain the low disk fraction and that the initial disk fraction should be as high as in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we also suggest that dust sublimation and stellar magnetic activity can not explain the enlargement of the inner disk hole in the low - metallicity environment .",
    "therefore , the significant decrease of the disk fraction implies that the disk lifetime is much shorter ( @xmath01myr ) than in the solar neighborhood ( 56myr ) .",
    "we suggest that the short disk lifetime is a result of the photoevaporation of the surface layer of the gas disk .",
    "we suggest that the lower disk lifetime with lower metallicity may be a major factor in explaining the planet - metallicity correlation .",
    "but this is model - dependent and further theoretical and observational work is needed .",
    "although we derived disk fractions for two very young clusters in this paper , it is necessary to study more embedded clusters in the eog to find a more quantitative relationship between the disk lifetime and the metallicity .",
    "it is also important to study the disks in longer wavelengths , e.g. , @xmath6-band and mid - infrared wavelength , to confirm if disks at larger radii also disappear rapidly , as suggested .",
    "these results will be a strong constraint for interpreting the planet - metallicity correlation , and ultimately for understanding how many planet - harboring stars we can expect in the galaxy @xcite .",
