    "assessing geometric and electronic structures of molecules via different scattering techniques using x - rays , ultrafast electrons and high harmonic generations ( hhg ) is a hot topic of current research in molecular physics since they provide a gateway to image chemical reactions in real time@xcite .",
    "conventional scattering techniques based on photons and electrons are able to achieve spatial resolutions needed for imaging static molecular geometry but they lack resolution in time to give a dynamic picture .",
    "techniques based on strong field ionization and ultrafast lasers are promising as they can be used to provide both sub - ngstrom spatial and sub - femtosecond temporal resolutions@xcite for dynamic imaging purposes .",
    "it is one of these techniques associated with strong - field ionization of molecules that is of interest in the present paper . for a thorough account of the latest trends in ultrafast molecular imaging methods , we refer the reader to ref.@xcite .",
    "the currently accepted vision of strong field ionization is the celebrated three - step model@xcite .",
    "when an atom or a molecule is excited with an intense infrared ( ir ) laser pulse , a quasi static potential barrier is formed in the combined potential curve of the system and the field through which a bound electron can tunnel out@xcite .",
    "it creates a laser driven electron wave packet in the ionization continuum , which is driven back and forth to the parent core by the applied field . on its return to this ionic core , the electron wave packet is scattered , resulting either in elastic scattering or in inelastic collision processes like high harmonic generation ( hhg ) or non - sequential double ionization ( nsdi)@xcite for instance .",
    "compared to the relatively inefficient inelastic processes , the elastic scattering of the ionized wave packet is the predominant outcome of the recollision .",
    "it is known as laser induced electron diffraction ( lied ) . following the first theoretical discussions in 1996@xcite , experimental realization of lied on simple molecular systems was first reported in 2008@xcite . since then , lied has been considered as a tool to study strong field dynamics of isolated molecules .",
    "it is well - known from optical physics that a diffraction pattern can be seen as the image of an object in the reciprocal space , from which light , or an incident matter wave , has been scattered . by designing an inverse algorithm , one can reconstruct the image of that object in real space .",
    "laser induced electron diffraction can be seen in the same perspective@xcite but unlike traditional scattering processes , in lied the scattering beam of electrons is extracted from the molecular system itself , acting as its own electron gun .",
    "after ionization and after an eventual recollision event , the outgoing electron wave carries information about the scattering centers .",
    "the photoelectron spectrum can thus be considered as an image of the system in the reciprocal space .",
    "given the similarity of lied with traditional diffraction techniques , it seems potentially possible to get information about the molecule from its lied photoelectron spectra .",
    "it was demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that lied can be used for extracting structural information about the equilibrium geometry of molecules with great accuracy@xcite .",
    "these recent experiments motivate developing lied - based techniques for imaging molecular dynamics . in particular , experimental developments reported in ref.@xcite demonstrate the simultaneous measurement of both c - h and c - c bond lengths of aligned c@xmath0h@xmath0 using lied spectra obtained with mid - ir laser fields . that the lied spectral data can be inverted to retrieve precise information on the molecular geometry",
    "is not surprising , although it undoubtedly represents a huge advance in molecular physics , given that this measure can in principle be made on a very short time scale , allowing molecular geometry changes during a reactive collision , for example , to be followed in a time - resolved manner .",
    "recently , one of the key research topic in strong field physics appeared to be the exploitation of the recollision process to retrieve not only structural or geometrical images but also to infer information on the electronic charge distribution of a molecule and even details of its field - free quantum eigenstates .",
    "those pieces of information are of great interest , especially for the understanding and the imaging of reaction dynamics , where the changes in the electronic charge distribution play a major role .",
    "achieving required spatial and temporal resolution could provide a tool for probing the transition states of a chemical reaction for example , by observing time - resolved deformation of the orbitals as transition states are crossed .",
    "such a tool would also be of a tremendous value to image the rapid dynamics which takes place close to conical intersections@xcite .    currently , hhg is the only strong field process that has been explored as a tool for imaging molecular orbitals using tomographic techniques@xcite , as originally demonstrated in@xcite .",
    "this hhg - based orbital imaging approach involves a rather elaborated inversion procedure , requiring the hhg spectra to be recorded at various laser - molecule alignment angles and their treatment , _",
    "i.e. _ the inversion procedure per - se , rests on a number of assumptions that are still a matter of debate .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an alternative route that can be used to extract both structural and orbital information of a molecule directly from its lied spectra .",
    "previously , we demonstrated how lied signals , for a symmetric molecule such as co@xmath0 , reflect the conservation of the nodal structure , _",
    "i.e. _ the symmetry character , of the initial molecular orbital ( mo ) from which the ionized electron has been extracted . here",
    ", we will show that more detailed information on this initial orbital can be retrieved from this signal , culminating with an explicit , complete mo reconstruction procedure .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] we briefly recall the single - active electron ( sae ) model of the co@xmath0 molecule as defined in the previous work and used in the present study , together with the numerical procedure for electron wave packet calculations within this model .",
    "then , in sec.[sec : num_res ] , through results of numerical simulations , we illustrate the specific features of the photoelectron lied spectrum associated with a _ molecular _",
    "orbital compared to the one of a typical _ atomic _ orbital . in sec.[sec : sfa_mod ] , we derive an analytical expression of the lied photoelectron momentum distribution , starting from formally exact integral expressions of the time - evolution operator describing the sae dynamics .",
    "the final analytical model makes use of the strong field approximation ( sfa ) and the inversion procedure used for the mo reconstruction assumes a simple lcao expression as a guess for the initial mo . finally in sec.[sec :",
    "reconstruction ] , we demonstrate this procedure in the case of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of the carbon dioxide molecule",
    ". we present some examples of reconstruction and we specify the accuracy and limits of our approach . the last section gives some concluding remarks and perspectives for future work .",
    "atomic units are used throughout the paper unless stated otherwise .",
    "to demonstrate how molecular orbitals can be imaged using lied , we consider the specific case of the symmetric , linear , carbon dioxide molecule , co@xmath0 , one of the most studied system in strong field physics@xcite .",
    "it is sufficiently complex to represent an interesting test case and it is relatively simple for calculations .",
    "it enables one to demonstrate the key features of electron dynamics in the presence of intense nir fields@xcite .",
    "the electronic dynamics induced by the field is described by the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the time - dependent electronic state of the model system constituted of the most weakly bound electron of the molecule and @xmath3 is its hamiltonian in the length gauge . here",
    "@xmath4 is an effective field - free binding potential and @xmath5 is the interaction of the active electron with the laser field .",
    "the linearly polarized electric field along @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the vector potential given by @xmath9 @xmath10 is the ir career frequency and @xmath11 , the electric field amplitude .",
    "@xmath12 is the carrier - envelop phase ( cep ) and @xmath13 denotes the temporal envelop of the pulse of full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath14 .",
    "the effective multi - well potential @xmath4 is as given in@xcite .",
    "it is a soft coulomb potential describing the attraction exerted on the single electron of the model system by screened nuclear charges with a screening factor that , for each nucleus , varies slowly with the distance separating the electron from the nuclear charge .",
    "we assume that the co@xmath0 molecule is pre - aligned along the @xmath15 direction . the intense ir laser pulse given by eq.([eq : e_of_t ] )",
    "is therefore applied normal to the molecular axis .",
    "thus the ionization and associated dynamics are assumed to take place in the plane defined by the orthogonal system of coordinates consisting of the molecular @xmath15-axis and of the polarization @xmath16-axis of the applied time - dependent electric field .",
    "molecule with the co internuclear distance @xmath17@xmath18au.,width=321 ]    fig.[fig : system](a ) depicts the geometry of the system within these assumptions and shows in a schematic way three typical ionization and recollision trajectories .",
    "the most probable recollision processes take place following a short trajectory@xcite , in about half an optical cycle , and therefore on a time scale of the order of 1 to 3 femtoseconds for wavelengths between 800 nm and 2@xmath19 m .",
    "the electronic dynamics that takes places on this typical time scale can be separated from the nuclear dynamics whose time scale is of the order of 15fs for the asymmetric stretch , 25fs for the symmetric stretch and of 60fs for the bending modes of co@xmath0 .",
    "we therefore consider , in a first approximation , that the nuclear motion is frozen with a fixed co bond length @xmath20 .",
    "the tdse([eq : tdse ] ) describing the electronic dynamics is solved with the split - operator method@xcite .",
    "the initial state is calculated using the imaginary time propagation technique@xcite and the ionization and recollision events are simulated by propagating the calculated initial state during the pulse . during the interaction with the field , the asymptotic part of the wave packet is extracted and projected onto volkov states in order to describe analytically the long range electronic dynamics@xcite . at the end of the pulse , corresponding to the time @xmath21 ,",
    "the asymptotic part of the wave packet is collected to obtain the energy - resolved transition amplitudes and hence the photoelectron spectrum .",
    "the entire numerical procedure is detailed in@xcite .",
    "the calculated photoelectron spectrum is the laser - induced electron diffraction spectrum or lied spectrum @xmath22 , which gives the two dimensional momentum distribution of the elastically scattered electron wave packets .",
    "we discuss here the salient features of typical lied spectra in preparation for the derivation of the inversion procedure of the next section .",
    "these spectra are calculated for the homo orbital of co@xmath0 , seen in fig.[fig : system](b ) , as the initial state .",
    "we also consider the spectra associated with the ionization out of a @xmath23 atomic orbital centered on the carbon atom .",
    "this will be referred as the ` atomic ' case",
    ".      lied photoelectron spectra provide a picture of the momentum ( @xmath24 ) distribution of the ionized electron .",
    "a typical photoelectron spectrum @xmath22 obtained from the solution of the tdse for the homo orbital of co@xmath0 at an extended geometry @xmath25 is given in log scale in fig.[fig : spectra_lambda ] for three different wavelengths and a single optical cycle pulse @xmath26 with no cep @xmath27 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the spectrum at the wavelength 800 nm , panel ( b ) at 1.4@xmath19 m and panel ( c ) at 2.0@xmath19 m for a laser intensity of @xmath28w/@xmath29 .",
    "the highest probabilities are in red and the lowest in blue .",
    "the outermost contour of the circular shape of the spectrum is elongated along @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e. _ in the direction of the polarization of the field .",
    "two successive ionization events corresponding to the maximum and minimum of @xmath31 in this ultra - short pulse create an oscillating continuum wave packet which is ultimately driven away from the molecule .",
    "the ionization events happen along the direction of the field , giving photoelectrons with momenta distributed as shown in the figure .",
    "the circular shape corresponds to the maximum recollision energy @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the ponderomotive energy@xcite .",
    "since @xmath33 is proportional to @xmath34 , an increase of the wavelength directly increases the size of the 2d photoelectron spectrum , as we can see in fig.[fig : spectra_lambda ] .",
    "longer wavelengths thus help making out the interference patterns of the spectrum . in the following",
    "we will use the largest wavelength @xmath35 m .",

    "all other parameters are as in fig.[fig : spectra_lambda ] .",
    "the panels ( a ) and ( b ) of the same figure show respectively the time variations of the electric field and of the total ionization probability for the atomic ( red solid line ) and for the molecular ( dashed blue line ) cases . for the atomic calculation , the parameters of the soft - core potential @xmath4 in eq.([eq : hamiltonian_1 ] )",
    "have been modified such that the atom has the same ionization potential compared to the homo of co@xmath0 , _ i.e. _ 9.2ev at @xmath25 .",
    "the electric field @xmath31 presents two main symmetric maxima pointing in opposite directions .",
    "for both the atomic and the molecular cases , the ionization takes place in two successive bursts .",
    "the probability of ionization rises just after each maximum of the field , and the delay separating a maximum of the field and the associated ionization burst is simply related to the time necessary for the ionized wave function to reach the asymptotic region .     as a function of time .",

    "more precisely these structures are due to the interference between long and short trajectories followed by recolliding electrons@xcite .",
    "they have a circular shape because , for a given energy long and short trajectories accumulate a fixed phase shift which is independent of the electron emission angle .",
    "another interesting interference in the atomic lied spectrum is due to the superposition of the pathways corresponding to direct ionization and to ionization preceded by recollision ( _ i.e. _ to rescattering ) .",
    "this holographic interference of the electron wave occurs only over a window of small @xmath40 values due to the limited spread of directly ionized electrons in the transverse direction@xcite .",
    "it also appears mainly in the @xmath41 region of fig.[fig : mol_atom_1_opt](c ) ( intense red colored region ) due to the particular field @xmath31 seen in panel ( a ) which drags the electron in the positive direction during the recollision .",
    "the associated interference patterns are relatively localized , _ i.e. _ limited in extension , and are therefore difficult to measure in an experiment .",
    "in addition , they are seen both in atomic and molecular cases , as we can see in the comparison with panel ( d ) and they are therefore not the best candidates for an analysis of the molecular structure .",
    "there is however a very clear and important difference between the atomic and molecular spectra which lies in the @xmath40 variation of the spectra .",
    "indeed , out of the different interference patterns seen in the molecular spectrum , a multiple - slit like interference can be distinguished in the @xmath40 momentum distribution .",
    "this multiple - slit like interference pattern is due to the scattering of the electron by the multi - well ionic potential describing the interaction with the nuclei .",
    "the molecular information , including the relative position of the nuclei , is therefore mainly imprinted in the @xmath40 momentum distribution , along the direction of the molecular axis . to get a simpler spectrum",
    "that we can more easily analyze , we average the electron signal @xmath22 over the @xmath30 momentum , keeping only the @xmath40 variation .",
    "this yields the averaged 1d lied spectrum @xmath42 it was already demonstrated that the bond length @xmath20 can directly be measured from the fringe width seen in this 1d spectrum@xcite .",

    "fig.[fig : mol_atom_4_opt ] shows similar atomic and molecular spectra , calculated with a 3.5-optical cycle laser pulse . even though the pulse duration is much larger",
    ", there are only three main maxima of the electric field which contribute significantly to the ionization signal , as seen in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig.[fig : mol_atom_4_opt ] .",
    "these maxima give rise to three bursts of ionization taking place in opposite directions . as a consequence",
    "the associated 2d momentum spectra are much more symmetric with respect to @xmath43 than the spectra associated with a single - cycle pulse seen in fig.[fig : mol_atom_1_opt ] .",

    "two main ingredients are necessary : ( i)an approximate description of the ionization and associated dynamics that result in the photoelectron spectra and ( ii)a simplified functional form for the initial state which will be used for the reconstruction .",

    "this is because these electrons are characterized by de broglie wavelengths small enough to resolve sub -  spatial scales .",
    "thus , describing accurately the low - energy part of the spectrum and the parallel momentum ( @xmath30 ) distribution of the photoelectrons is not essential .",
    "it has also been shown that large energies are reached by electrons ionized around a maximum of the field and hence around a minimum of the potential vector@xcite .",
    "thus @xmath101 can be neglected in eq.([eq : kprime ] ) .",
    "in addition electrons with high kinetic energies mainly recollide with the ionic core at a minimum of the field , corresponding to a maximum of the vector potential@xcite . in eq.([eq : ksecond ] ) we will therefore use @xmath102 .",
    "the potential vector @xmath103 therefore induces a strong shift on the parallel component @xmath30 of the electron momentum . in practice",
    ", this shift is of no significance in the present approach , since it will be averaged out in the calculation of eq.([eq:1d_spec_eqn ] ) and we will therefore not take it into account in the following .    within these approximations and to avoid discrepancies between the sfa spectrum and the spectrum obtained from the solution of the tdse , one should restrict the analysis of the 1d averaged signal to the highest @xmath40 momentum components only .",
    "the interest of this severe approximation lies however in the fact that it simplifies the model by allowing the separation of the temporal from the spatial integrals involved in eq.([eq : direct_amp_sfa3 ] ) .",
    "thus , for the direct ionization amplitudes , one has : @xmath104 where @xmath105 similarly , the recollision amplitude becomes @xmath106 using the closure property of the plane wave basis set one obtains @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the mean time during which the electron wave packet propagates in the continuum@xcite .",
    "the temporal and spatial integrals can thus be separated in the expression ( [ eq : appox_ar ] ) of the recollision amplitude as @xmath109 where @xmath110    finally , the approximate transition amplitude is given by @xmath111 this equation has to be developed on a suitable basis of initial states for the final analytical form of the lied spectra .",
    "eq.([eq : trans_amp_approximate_general ] ) expresses the ionization amplitude as a sum two terms , each written in the form of a product of spatial and temporal integrals.the first term is associated with direct ionization and , the second one with recollision events . as we see from the lied spectra , the information we are interested in is encoded in the spatial integrals .",
    "thus in the following discussions , the temporal integrals @xmath112 and @xmath113 will be taken as adjustable coefficients in order to match the approximate spectrum with the calculated spectrum .    to proceed further with the evaluation of the spatial integrals",

    ", this is usually expressed as a linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao method ) and there are many basis set ansatz for representing localized atomic wave functions . here",
    "the initial homo orbital is taken as an anti - symmetric linear combination of @xmath23 atomic orbitals ( see fig.[fig : system](b ) )    @xmath115    ideally one would choose for @xmath116 a slater - type orbital of the form @xmath117 with the normalization factor in two dimensions , where @xmath118 is the slater exponent .",
    "this analytical form , once introduced in eq.([eq : ini_guess_2px ] ) , is a reasonable candidate for representing the homo orbital but an important disadvantage then lies in the difficulty of evaluating multi - center integrals such as the recolliding integral of eq.([eq : trans_amp_approximate_general ] ) .",
    "it appears that this difficulty can be removed if the slater orbital ( [ eq : sto_2px ] ) is replaced by a gaussian type orbital of the form @xmath119 with the normalization factor , where @xmath120 is the gaussian exponent .",
    "actually , the gaussian function ( [ eq : sto-1g-2px ] ) can be made a good approximation of the slater orbital([eq : sto_2px ] ) with an appropriate choice of @xmath120 .    ) and slater - type ( [ eq : sto_2px ] ) orbitals used in the present study as a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath121 ( see text for details).,width=321 ]    fig.[fig : sto - gto - overlap ] shows the overlap between the wave functions ( [ eq : sto-1g-2px ] ) and ( [ eq : sto_2px ] ) as a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath121 .",

    "the two integrals associated with direct ionization amplitudes are just fourier transforms ( ft ) of products of the dipole operator @xmath16 with displaced @xmath23 orbitals . in momentum space ,",
