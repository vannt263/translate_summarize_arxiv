    "the determination of sub - arcsecond positions for short - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) is of the utmost importance for our growing understanding of their redshift distribution , energy scale , host galaxies , and local environments .",
    "such localizations require the detection of optical , near - infrared , or radio afterglows ; or alternatively an x - ray detection with the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "as of august 2009 , only 15 short grbs have been precisely localized in this manner , and all were detected in the optical band @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations of some of these bursts have led to the detection and characterization of host galaxies , most of them star forming , and a small proportion ( @xmath14 ) non - star forming ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the precise positions also allow us to study the local environment of the bursts within their hosts , and current observations point to offsets of @xmath15 kpc ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , since these are projected positions , and since we generally lack detailed afterglow observations that can shed light on the circumburst environment , little is known about whether the bursts originate within the inner or halo regions of their hosts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "rapid optical observations have also been used to place limits on emission from radioactive material synthesized in a putative sub - relativistic outflow associated with a compact object binary merger , a so - called li - paczynski mini - supernova @xcite . such emission is theorized to have a typical peak time of @xmath16 d , and a peak luminosity of @xmath17 erg s@xmath18 , corresponding to @xmath19 mag at @xmath20 .",
    "no such emission has been detected to date ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , no late - time emission from type ib / c supernova associations have been detected ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most recently , near - ir and optical non - detections of  have been used to place limits on emission from a putative mini - sn associated with this burst @xcite . here",
    "we report the detection of near - ir and optical counterparts of  about 2.3 hr after the burst , and show that the afterglow is actually one of the brightest near - ir short grb afterglows detected to date , but is one of the faintest in the optical .",
    "we use the observed fluxes and the unusually red color to investigate the properties of the afterglow and/or mini - sn , and to precisely measure the location of the burst relative to its host galaxy .",
    "our discovery of the afterglow of  suggests that recovery of a substantial fraction of short grb optical / near - ir afterglows requires observations to @xmath21 mag within about @xmath22 d.",
    "was discovered by the _ swift",
    "_ satellite on 2007 july 24 at 10:53:50 ut with a duration of @xmath23 s @xcite .",
    "the x - ray afterglow was detected with the on - board x - ray telescope ( xrt ) beginning 72 s after the burst , while no counterpart was detected with the uv / optical telescope @xcite .",
    "the x - ray position was subsequently determined to a precision of @xmath24 radius ( @xmath25 containment ) .",
    "an apparently extended source was detected in coincidence with the xrt error circle in digitized sky survey images , and tentatively proposed as a possible host @xcite .",
    "subsequent near - ir and optical observations from ukirt , gemini - north , the palomar 60-inch telescope , and the vlt revealed that the source was indeed an extended galaxy , but did not uncover an afterglow @xcite .",
    "a recent analysis using image subtraction on ukirt , not , ctio 1.3-m , keck , and vlt data similarly reveals no afterglow to limits of @xmath26 @xmath27jy and @xmath28 @xmath27jy at 3.2 and 22.2 hr after the burst , respectively @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy of the galaxy within the xrt error circle revealed that it is located at a redshift of @xmath29 , is undergoing active star formation at a rate of 2.5 m@xmath8 yr@xmath18 , has a luminosity of @xmath30 l@xmath31 , and a metallicity of @xmath32 ( @xcite ; see also @xcite for similar results ) .",
    "the resulting isotropic @xmath33-ray energy in the observed @xmath34 kev range is @xmath35 erg .",
    "we observed the field centered on  with the near infra - red imager and spectrometer ( niri ) mounted on the gemini - north 8-m telescope in the @xmath36 bands starting on 2007 july 24.566 ut ( 2.69 hr after the burst ) ; see table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "the observations were obtained in excellent seeing conditions , @xmath37 in the @xmath3-band .",
    "the data were reduced using the gemini package in iraf , and individual stacks were created in each filter .",
    "inspection of the images reveals a point source coincident with the south - east edge of the putative host galaxy ; see figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "optical observations were obtained with the gemini multi - object spectrograph ( gmos ) mounted on the gemini - north 8-m telescope in the @xmath38 bands starting on 2007 july 24.551 ut ( 2.33 hr after the burst ; table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the gemini package in iraf .",
    "the combined @xmath39-band image centered on the location of  is shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "an apparent extension is seen in the same location as the near - ir source .",
    "we obtained follow - up near - ir observations of the grb with persson s auxiliary nasmyth infrared camera ( panic ) mounted on the magellan / baade 6.5-m telescope on 2008 november 18.15 ut in the @xmath3 band ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the individual images were dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , and corrected for bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "we then created object masks , which were used to construct improved flat fields for a second round of reduction .",
    "the data were finally registered , shifted , and co - added .",
    "the resulting combined image is shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] , and clearly reveals that the point source visible in the niri images has faded away .",
    "similarly , late - time optical @xmath38-band observations were obtained with the low dispersion survey spectrograph ( ldss3 ) mounted on the magellan / clay 6.5-m telescope on 2008 december 7.14 ut ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "the data were reduced using standard procedures in iraf .",
    "the resulting @xmath39-band image is shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "as in the case of the late - time near - ir observations , the extension seen in the early gmos observations is no longer detected .    to confirm the fading afterglow and to obtain accurate photometry and astrometry we perform digital image subtraction on the niri and panic @xmath3-band images and on the gmos and ldss3 @xmath38 band images with the isis package @xcite , which accounts for variations in the stellar point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we adopt the panic and ldss3 images as templates with zero afterglow contribution since they were obtained about 1.3 yr after the burst .",
    "the resulting residual @xmath3- and @xmath39-band images are shown in figures [ fig : fig1 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] , respectively , and clearly demonstrate that the point source coincident with the host galaxy has faded away . we therefore conclude that this source is the afterglow of .",
    "we additionally performed image subtraction on the two niri @xmath3-band observations and find that the source has faded between mid - epochs of 2.832 and 3.696 hr after the burst at a @xmath4 confidence level ( figure  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "no residual is detected in the subtracted @xmath40-band image .",
    "we determine the absolute position of the afterglow from the niri and gmos residual images using the sextractor software package .",
    "since our niri images do not contain any 2mass stars , we first perform an astrometric tie of the gmos @xmath39-band image relative to usno - b ( using 13 common objects with a resulting rms of @xmath41 ) and then tie the niri astrometry to the @xmath39-band image ( using 20 common objects with a combined total rms of @xmath42 ) .",
    "the optical afterglow is located at @xmath43= , @xmath44= , while the near - ir afterglow position is @xmath43= , @xmath44= ( j2000 ) .",
    "these positions are consistent within the uncertainty of the astrometric tie .",
    "the optical / near - ir afterglow is offset by about @xmath45 and @xmath46 relative to the x - ray positions from @xcite and @xcite , which have @xmath25 containment errors of @xmath47 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the detection of the optical / near - ir afterglow makes the association of  with the previously - proposed host galaxy secure @xcite , and allows us to precisely measure the offset between the grb and host center .",
    "we perform differential astrometry on the niri images and find that the offset is @xmath48 east and @xmath49 south of the host center , corresponding to a radial offset of @xmath50 .",
    "the uncertainty reflects the centroiding accuracy of both the afterglow and host , which we determine using sextractor . at a redshift of @xmath29",
    "the scale is 5.785 kpc arcsec@xmath18 , and the offset is therefore @xmath51 kpc .",
    "this is similar to the offsets measured for previous short grbs with optical afterglows @xcite .",
    "the location of the burst in the late - time panic and ldss3 images does not exhibit any excess emission ; see figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "photometry of the afterglow was performed on all residual images using photometric standard stars that were observed in conjunction with the panic and ldss3 observations .",
    "we find that the afterglow had @xmath1 mag and @xmath52 mag in the first and second niri epochs , respectively , and @xmath2 mag in the gmos observation .",
    "the @xmath53 limit on the @xmath40-band magnitude is @xmath54 mag , determined by placing @xmath55 random apertures on the residual image and using the width of the resulting gaussian flux distribution as @xmath56 .",
    "the near - ir magnitudes are quoted in the vega system , while the optical magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "since the @xmath40-band limit is shallower than the detected @xmath39-band magnitude , it provides no meaningful constraints on the properties of the afterglow .",
    "the observed @xmath3- and @xmath39-band magnitudes correspond to fluxes of @xmath57 @xmath27jy , @xmath58 @xmath27jy , and @xmath59 @xmath27jy , respectively .",
    "we stress that the uncertainty in the flux of the near - ir afterglow is dominated by the convolution with the panic image , which was obtained under worse seeing conditions than the niri images . to assess the statistical uncertainty in the afterglow flux we note that a stellar point source with @xmath60 mag , identical to the afterglow brightness , located near the afterglow position has a @xmath56 uncertainty of @xmath61 mag in the niri images .",
    "this greater depth in the niri data allows us to detect a significant fading between the two niri observations despite an uncertainty of @xmath62 mag relative to the panic observation .",
    "we note that the afterglow is also clearly detected in the @xmath63- and @xmath64-band images from niri .",
    "however , due to the lack of late - time template images we can not robustly measure its brightness in these bands . still , a color - composite image reveals that the afterglow is redder in the near - ir bands than the rest of the host galaxy ; see figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "a comparison of our afterglow near - ir flux measurements to contemporaneous limits from ukirt observations by @xcite reveals that the afterglow is about a factor of three times fainter than the ukirt upper limits .",
    "these authors also find a limit on the optical emission at 0.93 d after the burst of @xmath28 @xmath27jy .",
    "a comparison to our detected @xmath39-band flux at 0.12 d indicates that the afterglow temporal decay index is @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , typical of grb afterglows .    on the other hand ,",
    "a comparison of our contemporaneous @xmath3- and @xmath39-band fluxes reveals an unusually steep spectral index , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "typically we expect @xmath69 to @xmath70 for a wide range of electron power law indices and values of the synchrotron cooling frequency @xcite .",
    "the unusually red afterglow can be explained in two ways .",
    "first , the optical emission may be suppressed by extinction within the host galaxy . to reconcile the observed fluxes with a typical spectral index of @xmath69 requires @xmath71 mag , or a rest - frame @xmath6 mag for a milky way extinction curve .",
    "such a large extinction seems unlikely given the location of the afterglow at the edge of the host galaxy .",
    "however , a large average value of @xmath72 mag ( i.e. , @xmath73 mag ) has been inferred for the host galaxy based on its ratio of h@xmath33 and h@xmath74 emission lines @xcite , indicating that extinction may indeed play a role in suppressing the optical emission .",
    "we further investigate this possibility by comparison to the x - ray afterglow brightness at the time of the optical observations , @xmath75 @xmath27jy @xcite .",
    "this leads to an optical to x - ray spectral index of @xmath76 , which marginally qualifies  as a `` dark burst '' @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the near - ir to x - ray spectral index , @xmath77 , is consistent with a typical afterglow .",
    "thus , the comparison of the optical / near - ir and x - ray afterglow emission is consistent with a standard afterglow origin and significant dust extinction .",
    "we note that @xcite find excess absorption in the early x - ray data , but attribute this result to rapid variations in the x - ray flux and spectral hardness . in light of the possible significant dust extinction",
    ", the excess photoelectric absorption may indeed be real .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the near - ir flux is dominated by a different source of emission than the afterglow . in particular , in the context of a compact object merger , the emission may be due to the decay of radioactive material synthesized in a sub - relativistic outflow , the so - called li - paczynski mini - supernova ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . in the formulation of @xcite , the emission from such a mini - sn",
    "is described by a peak luminosity ( @xmath78 ) : @xmath79 a peak effective temperature ( @xmath80 ) : @xmath81 and a peak time ( @xmath82 ) : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the fraction of rest mass energy released by the radioactivity , @xmath85 is the ejecta mass in units of m@xmath8 , @xmath86 is the ejecta velocity , @xmath87 is the average opacity ,",
    "@xmath88 @xmath89 g@xmath18 is the electron scattering opacity , and we use the notation @xmath90 .    for our detected source we use the near - ir luminosity and observed time as proxies for @xmath78 and @xmath82 , respectively , leading to @xmath91 erg s@xmath18 and @xmath92 d. using the constraint that @xmath93 and assuming that @xmath94 , we find from equation  [ eqn : tp ] that @xmath95 ( i.e. , @xmath96 m@xmath8 ) . in conjunction with equation  [ eqn : lp ]",
    "this provides a lower limit of @xmath97 .",
    "the resulting lower limit on the effective temperature is @xmath98 k , corresponding to a peak in the uv rather than in the near - ir . the apparent discrepancy in the spectral peak",
    "may be viewed as an indication that the observed emission is not due to a mini - sn .",
    "however , we note that equations  [ eqn : lp]-[eqn : tp ] correspond to the case of a power law decay model with an assumed contribution from elements with a wide range of decay timescales",
    ". an exponential decay model , in which a single element dominates the release of energy , may lead to distinctly different luminosity and evolution @xcite .",
    "to summarize , the unusually red optical / near - ir counterpart of , can be explained as a typical afterglow with significant dust extinction , @xmath6 mag .",
    "the alternative explanation of a mini - sn leads to an expected peak in the uv , but this may suggest that the mini - sn models should be revised .",
    "optical afterglow emission has now been detected from 16 short grbs , including . in figure",
    "[ fig : ag ] we plot the flux of each optical afterglow at the time of its discovery . for",
    "we show both the optical and near - ir fluxes , as well as the expected @xmath39-band flux extrapolated from the @xmath3-band using a typical spectral index of @xmath99 .",
    "while the observed @xmath39-band flux is one of the faintest to date , the near - ir flux indicates that the afterglow of  is actually one of the brightest at the time of its discovery .",
    "indeed , only the optical afterglows of grbs 050724 , 060313 , 070714 , and 090510 were brighter , and of these only the afterglow of grb050724 was discovered on a comparable timescale ; the optical afterglows of grbs 060313 , 070714 , and 090510 were all discovered @xmath100 min after the burst . on a timescale of 1 hr to 1 d after the burst , the optical afterglows of short grbs generally have fluxes of @xmath101 @xmath27jy , about two orders of magnitude lower than the typical brightness of long grb afterglows ( e.g , @xcite ) . from the existing distribution",
    "we conclude that the detection of a substantial fraction of short grb afterglows requires optical / near - ir observations to @xmath21 mag within @xmath102 d.    the unusually red afterglow of  can be explained with a substantial rest - frame dust extinction , @xmath6 mag .",
    "this value is larger than the typical extinction inferred for most long - duration grbs , @xmath103 mag ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and indeed the optical to x - ray spectral index , @xmath104 , marginally qualifies  as a dark burst @xcite .",
    "since the grb is located on the edge of its host galaxy , it is likely that the extinction arises in the local environment of the burst .",
    "this implies that the progenitor system was not ejected from the host galaxy into the halo or intergalactic medium . instead",
    ", the large extinction may point to an explosion site within a star forming region , or alternatively that the progenitor system itself produced the dust ( for example , a binary system with an evolved agb star ) .",
    "the possibility that some short grbs are obscured by dust has important ramifications for the nature of the progenitors , and can also serve to localize the bursts to the galactic disk environments . thus , rapid and deep near - ir observations are of crucial importance .",
    "alternatively , in the context of a compact object merger model , the near - ir emission may arise from radioactive decay in a sub - relativistic outflow produced during the merger process  a mini - sn . in this scenario",
    ", we find that the required ejected mass is @xmath96 m@xmath8 , with a radioactive energy release efficiency of @xmath105 .",
    "we note , however , that in the standard formulation the spectral peak at this time is expected to be in the uv rather than in the near - ir .",
    "this may indicate that the detected source is completely due to afterglow emission , or that the mini - sn models need to be revised .",
