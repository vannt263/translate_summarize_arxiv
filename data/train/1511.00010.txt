    "the diffuse atomic interstellar medium ( ism ) , the mass reservoir in galaxies from which molecular clouds and stars are born , is highly turbulent and strongly magnetized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the roles of turbulence and magnetic fields in the context of star formation have been emphasized many times .",
    "additionally , the importance of turbulence and magnetic fields on large scales is clear from comparison of each component s pressure to the vertical weight of the ism disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the solar neighborhood , representing fairly typical conditions among star forming galactic disks ,",
    "turbulent and magnetic pressures are roughly comparable to each other ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and about three times larger than the thermal pressure in diffuse gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , turbulence and magnetic fields provide most of the vertical support to the gas layer , and are essential to include in models of the vertical structure in galactic disks",
    ". moreover , the magnetic field has a significant random component ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent review ) , which presumably is related to observed turbulent velocities .",
    "this implies an intriguing additional dimension to models in which the star formation rate ( sfr ) is connected to the vertical dynamical equilibrium of the ism disk via turbulence driven by star formation feedback @xcite .",
    "another important characteristic of the diffuse atomic ism is its multiphase nature , which emerges naturally as a consequence of thermal instability with a realistic treatment of cooling and heating @xcite .",
    "the temperature and density of the cold and warm medium differ by about two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneous , multiphase structure of the diffuse atomic ism is observed to be ubiquitous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the warm and cold phases , the hot phase that is created by supernovae ( sne ) is an essential ism component @xcite .",
    "this phase contains very little mass , but is of great dynamical importance because the expansion of high - pressure sn remnants and superbubbles is the main driver of turbulence in the surrounding denser phases of the ism ( and also drives galactic winds ) .",
    "owing to the huge difference between cooling and dynamical times and correspondingly large range of spatial scales , directly modeling the multiphase ism is numerically quite challenging .",
    "however , the combination of increasing computational resources , with robust algorithms for evolving gas dynamics and thermodynamics simultaneously , have enabled development of highly sophisticated ism models in the last decade .",
    "direct numerical simulations of vertically stratified galactic disks with sn driven turbulence and stiff source terms to follow heating and cooling include those of . among those , only ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  i ) and have a time - dependent sfr and sn rate self - consistently set by the self - gravitating localized collapse of gas",
    ".    the time - dependent response of the sfr to large - scale ism dynamics and thermodynamics is key to self - consistent regulation of turbulent and thermal pressures , since both the turbulent driving rate ( from sne ) and thermal heating rate ( from far - uv - emitting massive stars ) are proportional to the sfr .",
    "if heating rates and turbulent driving rates drop due to a low sfr , the increased mass of cold , dense gas subsequently leads to a rebound in the sfr .",
    "the opposite is also true , with an excessively high sfr checked by the ensuing reduction in the mass of gas eligible to collapse . within less than an orbital time ,",
    "the sfr self - regulates such that the ism achieves a statistical equilibrium state . in this state",
    ", there are balances between ( 1 ) vertical gravity and the combined pressure forces , ( 2 ) turbulent driving and dissipation , and ( 3 ) cooling and heating ( see @xcite for analytic theory , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i ) for numerical confirmations ) .",
    "paper  i successfully reproduces important aspects of the diffuse atomic ism , demonstrating self - regulated sfr and vertical equilibrium following the analytic theory for a range of galactic conditions including those of the solar neighborhood as well as regions with higher and lower total ism surface density .",
    "in addition , the warm / cold ratios and properties of 21 cm emission / absorption for ( including column density and spin temperature distributions ) are in agreement with observations @xcite .    despite of the success of hydrodynamic ( hd ) models in paper  i ,",
    "the dynamical role of magnetic fields can not be ignored .",
    "for example , have run magnetized ism disk models with self - gravity and sn feedback , showing a factor of two decrement in the sfr compared to the hd case .",
    "however , a systematic exploration of the effect of magnetic fields is still lacking . in this paper , a set of three - dimensional , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations is carried out , to test the effects of different initial magnetic field strengths and configuration .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we begin by reviewing the analytic theory and previous simulation results to identify and explain the properties and parameters we will measure here . section  [ sec : method ] summarizes our numerical methods and model parameters . our basis is the fiducial solar neighborhood model from paper  i with gas surface density of 10@xmath11 , but here we slightly alter the initial and boundary conditions to minimize early vertical oscillations that were exaggerated in paper  i. section  [ sec : results ] contains our main new results .",
    "time evolution of disk diagnostics in section  [ sec : evol ] shows that a quasi - steady state is achieved . in section  [ sec : equil ] , we analyze temporally and horizontally averaged vertical profiles to confirm vertical dynamical equilibrium .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : sfr ] presents the measurements of `` feedback yields , '' exploring the mutual relationship between measured sfr surface density and the various midplane pressure supports .",
    "we compare the numerical results with analytic expectations including magnetic terms . in section",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize and discuss the model disk properties at saturation in comparison to observations and previous simulations , especially focusing on the level of mean and turbulent magnetic fields .",
    "before describing the results of our new simulations , it is informative to summarize the analytic theory for mutual equilibrium of the ism and star formation in disk systems , as developed in our previous work @xcite .",
    "this includes a list of the parameters to be measured for detailed investigation .",
    "the equilibrium theory assumes a quasi - steady state that satisfies force balance between vertical gravity and pressure support , and energy balance between gains from star formation feedback and losses in the dissipative ism .",
    "we shall test the validity of these assumptions and quantify the relative contributions to the vertical support from turbulent , thermal , and magnetic terms .",
    "we shall also measure the efficiency of feedback ( feedback yield ) for each support term .    using the temporally- and horizontally- averaged momentum equation , it is straightforward to show that vertical dynamical equilibrium requires a balance between the total momentum flux difference between surfaces at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and the weight of the gas : @xmath14 . in magnetized , turbulent galactic disks ,",
    "the vertical momentum flux consists of thermal ( @xmath15 ) , turbulent ( @xmath16 ) , and magnetic ( @xmath17 ) terms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that the magnetic term includes both pressure and tension , and can be rewritten as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the alfvn velocity from the total magentic field and @xmath20 is from its @xmath21 component .",
    "we hereafter refer to @xmath22 as the magnetic `` support '' to distinguish from the usual magnetic `` pressure '' ( @xmath23 ) , while the thermal and turbulent `` supports '' are equivalent to the thermal and turbulent `` pressures , '' respectively .",
    "if we choose @xmath13 where the gas density is sufficiently small , @xmath24 , @xmath25 by definition , but @xmath26 can in general be nonzero and significant .",
    "we thus have @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the sum of thermal and turbulent velocity dispersions , and @xmath29 is the relative contribution to the vertical support from magnetic to kinetic ( thermal plus turbulent ) terms . if @xmath30 , @xmath31 . here and hereafter",

    "we now specialize to the case of a galactic disk with a midplane density of stars + dark matter equal to @xmath41 , for which the external gravity near the midplane is @xmath42 .",
    "vertical dynamical equilibrium can be expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the ratio of external to self gravity . by substituting from equation ( [ eq : wsg ] ) for @xmath45 and from equation ( [ eq : chidef ] ) for @xmath46 in equation ( [ eq : de ] )",

    "the magnetic term @xmath66 in @xmath67 is more difficult to measure directly .",
    "we shall show , however , that if the model disk is fully saturated , @xmath68 appears to be insensitive to the initial magnetic geometry or strength .",
    "this implies that the predicted equilibrium midplane pressure support may similarly be obtained from observables using equations ( [ eq : de ] ) , ( [ eq : chi ] ) , ( [ eq : c ] ) , ( [ eq : sigmaeff ] ) if estimates of @xmath69 and @xmath63 from simulations are adopted .    to test the validity of vertical dynamical equilibrium , for our simulations we will compare full vertical profiles of the total ( turbulent , thermal , and magnetic ) support with the vertical profiles of the weight of the gas .",
    "these profiles are based on horizontal and temporal averages of the simulation outputs at all values of @xmath21 , including the midplane . in equilibrium",
    ", the weight and total support profiles must match each other .",
    "due to the highly dissipative nature of the ism , continuous energy injection is necessary to maintain thermal as well as turbulent kinetic and magnetic components of the vertical support at a given level .",
    "massive young stars inject prodigious energy , providing the feedback that is key to self - regulation of the sfr .",
    "when the system is out of equilibrium , with not enough massive young stars , lack of energy injection leads the entire ism to become dynamically and thermally cold .",
    "a cold disk is highly susceptible to gravitational collapse ; it forms new stars that supply the  missing \" feedback and restore equilibrium . in the opposite case , with too many massive stars ,",
    "the ism becomes dynamically and thermally hot , quenching further star formation by suppressing gravitational instability .",
    "simulations of local model disks show that the sfr converges to the quasi - steady value predicted by theory , in which the vertical support produced by feedback matches the requirements set by vertical dynamical equilibrium .",

    "we note , however , that since our horizontal dimension is only 512 pc and assumed to be periodic , magnetic energy loss might be somewhat overestimated in our simulations compared to the case in which azimuthal fields are anchored at larger scales . in principle , if numerical reconnection in our models is faster than realistic small - scale reconnection ( which is uncertain ) should be , we might also overestimate the growth of mean magnetic fields in weak - field models .",

    "vertical structure of the diffuse ism _  the vertical distribution and gravitational support of the diffuse ism in the milky way has been investigated many times under the assumption of vertical dynamical equilibrium . in section",
    "[ sec : equil ] , we validate that vertical dynamical equilibrium is satisfied in turbulent , star - forming , magnetized galactic disks , extending results from previous multiphase ism simulations with various physical ingredients @xcite . at the midplane , vertical support is dominated by the turbulent ( kinetic ) pressure except in model ( mb1 ) with very strong mean magnetic fields ( see figure  [ fig : balance ] and table  [ tbl : meanp ] ) .",
    "thermal and turbulent magnetic supports are comparable to each other and about 2 - 3 times smaller than the turbulent pressure . compared to hd models , mhd disk models can maintain smaller turbulent and thermal pressures owing to additional vertical support from the turbulent and mean magnetic fields .",
    "despite of different magnetization , the total effective velocity dispersion @xmath62 varies by only @xmath10 over all models ( see table  [ tbl : meanv ] ) , resulting in similar variation in @xmath46 and hence dynamical equilibrium midplane pressure @xmath442 . +",
    "our models demonstrate that vertical dynamical equilibrium is indeed a good assumption even though disks are magnetized and highly dynamic .",
    "however , practical application of vertical equilibrium in observations is not simple . even in the solar neighborhood",
    ", uncertainty is substantial .",
    "for example , @xcite calculated the total equilibrium pressure based on observations of the vertical gas distribution and gravity , and taking the difference with observed thermal+turbulent pressure inferred significant contributions from non - thermal ( cosmic - ray and magnetic ) pressures .",
    "however , @xcite have argued that local ( high - latitude ) 21 cm emission data can be fitted with three - component gaussians , and that non - thermal vertical support is not necessary to explain the distribution .",
    "considering the large observed scale height of non - thermal pressure terms , the vertical support of within @xmath443 ( which depends on the pressure gradient , not pressure itself ) , can be explained solely by thermal + turbulent terms .",
    "later , simultaneously analysed the distribution of emission at 21 cm from warm / cold with h@xmath358 from diffuse ionized gas , soft x - rays for the hot medium , and synchrotron radiation combined with @xmath444-ray emission probing magnetic fields and cosmic rays .",
    "they concluded that within @xmath445 of the midplane , cosmic ray support is not required , and turbulent magnetic fields contribute with @xmath446 ( @xmath447 in their notation ) .",
    "the contribution of turbulent magnetic support compared to thermal+turbulent kinetic pressure in our simulations is @xmath10 from table  [ tbl : meanp ] , in good agreement with this result . in our simulations ,",
    "the mean magnetic field has a relatively small scale height ( figure  [ fig : pprof ] ) and vertical support slightly less than that of the turbulent magnetic field .",
    "in contrast , observations indicate that magnetic fields extend into the halo in equipartion with the pressures of cosmic rays and hot gas .",
    "the decline in mean magnetic fields with height in our present simulations may be due to the absence of a hot medium and cosmic rays ; this issue will be addressed in future work .",
    "+ adoption of vertical equilibrium is useful to estimate the midplane pressure in external galaxies .",
    "the pressure can not be measured directly except for nearby edge - on disks , and even in that case requires deprojection and an assumption for the turbulent velocity dispersion @xcite . as outlined in section",
    "[ sec : theory ] , to get the total dynamical equilibrium pressure ( or the total weight of the gas ; see equation ( [ eq : de ] ) ) , one may need to determine @xmath60 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath62 ( or @xmath59 and @xmath69 ) , assuming the parameter @xmath58 is nearly constant . in several systematic studies of nearby galaxies",
    "@xcite , @xmath62 and/or @xmath448 are assumed to be constant to determine the total midplane pressure .",
    "observational measurements have suggested that velocity dispersions are nearly constant with @xmath449 , especially for the atomic gas dominated regime , using single gaussian fitting @xcite and intensity - weighted second velocity moments @xcite .",
    "recent studies of global kinematics analysis to obtain `` superprofiles '' ( averaged profiles for the entire galaxy ) in nearby spiral and dwarf galaxies have arrived at similar conclusions @xcite . in this paper , we show that the contribution from turbulent magnetic field to @xmath69 ( or , equivalently , @xmath450/\\sigma_z^2)$ ] is @xmath451 insensitive to the mean magnetic field strength for saturated models ( except model mb1 ) .",
    "this suggests that if the total velocity dispersion @xmath59 can be measured accurately , an estimate of @xmath62 needed to compute @xmath452 and @xmath46 and therefore the total midplane pressure may be obtained using a typical value of @xmath453 even if the observed magnetic field strength is not measured .",
    "+ the density structure in our simulations is well characterized by two components , a cold and non - cold medium ( see figure  [ fig : density ] ) . for the present models , we find scale heights of cold and non - cold components",
    "are @xmath454 and @xmath455 , respectively . @xcite",

    "our simulations agree with both of these observational studies in the sense that the warmer component has @xmath464 times the scale height of the colder component . however , our measured @xmath376 values are somewhat lower than observed solar - neighborhood values , as our measured values of @xmath59 and @xmath9 .",
    "simulations currently underway that include a hot ism suggest that @xmath376 , @xmath59 , and @xmath9 may increase .",
    "feedback efficiencies and star formation laws _",
    " one of the important conclusions of this study is that the feedback yields for turbulent and thermal pressure are unchanged by the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "this is mainly because the hd and mhd turbulent energy dissipation rates are similar .",
    "the dissipation time scale is always of order the crossing time at the driving scale ( or main energy - containing scale ) both for hd turbulence @xcite and mhd turbulence @xcite , and both compressible and incompressible flows .",
    "turbulent magnetic fields saturate at a similar timescale to turbulent velocities .",
    "balancing turbulent driving with turbulent dissipation therefore leads to direct proportionality between @xmath9 and the turbulent kinetic and magnetic pressures .",
    "similarly , balancing heating and cooling leads to a direct proportionality between @xmath9 and the thermal pressure .",
    "turbulent kinetic and magnetic pressures . defining `` yield '' as the pressure - to-@xmath9 ratio ( in convenient units ;",
    "see equation  [ eq : eta ] ) , we obtain turbulent , thermal , and turbulent magnetic feedback yields as @xmath367 , @xmath465 , and @xmath466 , respectively . since the ism weight and therefore total pressure is nearly the same irrespective of magnetization , the addition of magnetic terms to the total @xmath8 reduces @xmath9 for mhd compared to hd simulations at a given @xmath60 and @xmath41 .",

    "* paper  i ) , this is because the total midplane pressure is directly related to the sfr , whereas ism properties ( and the sfr ) can vary considerably at a given value of @xmath60 depending on the gravitational potential confining the disk . as shown in ( * ? ? ?",

    "as demonstrated in this paper , there can also be scatter introduced in @xmath9 vs. @xmath429 if support from the mean magnetic field contributes substantially without itself having @xmath473 .",
    "even if a mean - field dynamo secularly leads to a well - define asymptotic ratio between @xmath426 and @xmath9 , the long timescale to reach this may mean that @xmath426 is not well correlated with the recent sfr . if the vertical scale height of the mean field is larger than that of the star - forming gas , however , the support from @xmath426 would be small even if the mean field pressure is non - negligible , which would reduce scatter in @xmath9 vs. @xmath429 .",

    "the mean magnetic component in the 1pc simulation is systematically reduced , and has the largest temporal fluctuation , also causing a slightly smaller saturated value of the turbulent magnetic component . considering that the mean magnetic component always shows the slowest convergence , it is possible that with a longer integration time , the mean magnetic field in the 1pc model would approach that of the other models .",
