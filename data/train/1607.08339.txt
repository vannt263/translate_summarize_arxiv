    "bars are quite common morphological features among late - type galaxies . depending on the exact definition about half of them can be considered as barred ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "bars formed in isolation are believed to originate from instabilities in axisymmetric disks ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and their evolution is controlled by a number of parameters , including the presence and properties of a live halo @xcite and the initial velocity dispersion of the disk @xcite . in simulations ,",
    "bars tend to grow in time in terms of length and strength while decreasing their pattern speed .",
    "this rather steady growth can be slowed down by episodes of buckling instability that lead to the vertical thickening of the bar and the formation of boxy / peanut shapes or pseudobulges @xcite .",
    "bars can also form as a result of tidal interactions with other galaxies or environment @xcite .",
    "the milky way galaxy seems to be a typical barred spiral ( for a recent review of its properties see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the bar in the milky way is composed of a shorter ( the length of 3 kpc ) and a longer ( 5 kpc ) component .",
    "the shorter one is thicker and known to possess a boxy / peanut shape since the observations in the infrared by the cobe satellite @xcite .",
    "the density distributions of the red clump stars within 1 kpc are approximately exponential with axis ratios 10:6.3:2.6 @xcite .",
    "the bar pattern speed is not accurately known and an average over different measurements gives values around @xmath2 km s@xmath3 kpc@xmath3 . from our position near the sun",
    "we see the bar at an angle of about 27 deg .",
    "recent kinematic measurements of the bar from the apogee survey reveal that it is characterized by cylindrical rotation at the level of 170 km s@xmath3 at 35 deg of galactic longitude and the central velocity dispersion of 120 km s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the spiral structure of the milky way is much less constrained , mainly due to our unfavorable observational position close to the disk plane .",
    "although a number of spiral arms were identified and named , their detailed properties remain poorly known . in a recent study",
    "@xcite combined data for thousands of different spiral tracers and found them to be well fitted by models of both three- and four - arm logarithmic spirals . to further complicate the picture",
    ", they also found that polynomial - logarithmic spirals ( with variable pitch angles ) are able to better match the observed tangential directions .",
    "the origin of milky way spiral arms is equally vague and many scenarios have been proposed , starting from the classical density wave theory of @xcite to spiral features seeded by density inhomogeneities @xcite and tidal effects of nearby dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed that the spiral structure formation is driven by the bar through manifolds @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we report on a discovery of a new phenomenon in the simulation of a bar in a milky way - like galaxy , which we refer to as ` bar damping ' . in the configuration we consider here it occurs early on , soon after the formation of the bar and seems to be tightly related to the manifold - driven spiral arms .",
    "the initial conditions for our simulation consisted of an @xmath0-body realization of a milky way - like galaxy generated via procedures described in @xcite and @xcite that allow to create @xmath0-body models of galaxies very near equilibrium .",
    "our milky way had parameters similar to the model mwa of @xcite , with two components : an nfw @xcite dark matter halo and an exponential disk , but no classical bulge .",
    "each of the two components was made of @xmath4 particles .",
    "the dark matter halo had a virial mass @xmath5 m@xmath6 and concentration @xmath7 .",
    "the disk had a mass @xmath8 m@xmath6 , about 25% larger than the disk mass of mwa .",
    "we increased the disk mass by the bulge mass of the original mwa model since we expect the ( pseudo)bulge to form out of the disk as a result of bar formation and evolution .",
    "the scale - length of the disk was @xmath9 kpc and the thickness @xmath10 kpc .",
    "the central radial velocity dispersion of the disk was @xmath11 km s@xmath3 .",
    "both components of the galaxy were smoothly cut off at appropriate scales .",
    "the minimum value of the toomre parameter of this realization was @xmath12 so we expect the model to form a bar on a short time scale .",
    "the evolution of the system in the simulation was followed for 10 gyr using the gadget-2 @xmath0-body code @xcite with outputs saved every 0.05 gyr .",
    "the adopted softening scales were @xmath13 kpc and @xmath14 kpc for the disk and halo of the galaxy , respectively .",
    "the evolution of the properties of the stellar component of the galaxy is illustrated in figure  [ properties ] .",
    "for each simulation output we introduce the spherical coordinate system centered on the galaxy s center so that @xmath15 measures the angle in the disk plane and @xmath16 away from the plane .",
    "the measurements shown with the red lines were done using stars within the spherical radius of 5 kpc and those shown with the blue lines using stars in the outer part of the disk , within 5 kpc@xmath17 kpc .",
    "the upper panel gives the stellar mass contained in these radial ranges , the next two panels show the kinematic properties in terms of the mean velocity along the spherical coordinate @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and the velocity dispersion along @xmath16 , @xmath19 .",
    "the last three panels plot the shape properties of the stellar component in terms of the shortest to longest axis @xmath20 , the triaxiality parameter @xmath21/[1-(c / a)^2]$ ] ( where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the lengths of the longest , intermediate and shortest axis of the stellar component ) and the bar mode @xmath25 . the axis ratios were calculated using the inertia tensor and the @xmath25 from the projected positions of the stars onto the disk plane .    the evolution of the bar mode @xmath25 clearly shows that the bar starts to form very quickly after the beginning of the simulation and its first maximum is reached soon after 1 gyr from the start .",
    "after that the bar mode abruptly decreases to start growing again around 3 gyr from the beginning of the simulation .",
    "similar conclusions are supported by the analysis of the evolution of the triaxiality parameter : it increases strongly soon after 1 gyr to reach the values above @xmath26 in the inner part , signifying the formation of a strongly prolate spheroid .",
    "the moment of the formation of the bar is accompanied by significant redistribution of stellar mass : as demonstrated by the first panel , the stars are moved from the outer to the inner part of the galaxy . the axis ratio @xmath20 is rather stable over the first gyr but soon experiences dramatic increase .",
    "this increase is not smooth but happens in a number of rather separate steps .",
    "= 7.5 cm    since the thickening of the bar is usually caused by buckling , we have also calculated other , kinematic buckling diagnostics in terms of the absolute value of the mean velocity along the spherical coordinate @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and the velocity dispersion along @xmath16 , @xmath19 . as discussed in @xcite , the presence of streaming velocity out of the disk plane ( whether quantified by @xmath18 or @xmath27 ) is a good signature of the presence of buckling instability .",
    "the effect of the buckling is to increase the @xmath20 axis ratio , but also the velocity dispersion in the vertical direction , which we measure here by @xmath19 .",
    "clearly , the comparison between the third and fourth panels of figure  [ properties ] reveals that the two quantities trace each other in both radial ranges .",
    "interestingly , the behavior of @xmath18 is different in the inner and outer part of the disk : while it has only two peaks in the inner part ( red line ) , it shows four maxima in the outer part ( blue line ) , with every consecutive peak wider in time than the previous one .",
    "the analysis therefore points to only two buckling episodes in the inner disk but four in the outer part .    except for these multiple , rather than",
    "just one or two , buckling events typically seen in simulations @xcite , the evolution of the bar seems to proceed as usually found in similar studies .",
    "an interesting behavior reveals itself however once we move from single - value measurements of characteristic properties of the stellar component to more detailed ones . since our main interest here is the bar properties the obvious characteristic to calculate is the profile of the bar mode @xmath28 .",
    "a few examples of such measurements along the cylindrical radius @xmath29 at different times are shown in figure  [ a2profiles ] .",
    "the profile demonstrates strong variability in time , from the highest values around 1.2 gyr , when the maximum is @xmath30 to much smaller ones soon after , for example at @xmath31 and 2.7 gyr when @xmath32 is only around 0.3 . later on",
    "the bar mode grows again to reach the initial high values at the end of evolution .",
    "an even more complete picture can be created if @xmath28 are calculated for each simulation output and plotted as a function of time in the form of a map , such as the one shown in the upper panel of figure  [ a2modestime ] .",
    "this image clearly reveals a kind of damping behavior of the bar mode between 1 and 1.7 gyr from the start .",
    "in order to resolve this phenomenon better in time , we rerun the simulation between 1 and 2 gyr saving outputs ten times more often , i.e. every 0.005 gyr .",
    "the map of the dependence of @xmath28 on time in this time range is shown in the lower panel of figure  [ a2modestime ] . now",
    "a clear pattern of repeated increase and decrease of the bar mode is visible . to obtain some insight into the nature of the phenomenon we looked at the maps of the surface density distribution of the stars viewed face - on",
    "a few examples at different times are shown in figure  [ surden ] .",
    "the plots show distinct images of the bar ( not aligned with the @xmath33-axis but in the coordinate system of the simulation box ) , but also reveal the presence of strong spiral arms or rings .",
    "the spiral arms clearly seem to be driven by the bar and look like the manifold - driven spirals discussed by @xcite .",
    "= 7.5 cm = 0.837 cm = 7.5 cm = 0.837 cm    = 4.2 cm = 4.2 cm = 4.2 cm = 4.2 cm    = 7.8 cm    to study the phenomenon further we have measured the basic properties of the stellar component between 1 and 2 gyr from the start , with this higher time resolution .",
    "the measurements were done for stars within the radius of 5 kpc only this time , because this is where the damping seems to occur and are shown in figure  [ propdetail ] .",
    "in addition to the properties already discussed using figure  [ properties ] , namely the stellar mass @xmath34 ( first panel ) , the axis ratio @xmath20 ( second panel ) , the triaxiality parameter @xmath35 , the bar mode @xmath25 ( fourth panel ) , the velocity and velocity dispersion along @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( the last two panels ) , we added here measurements of the intermediate to longest axis ratio @xmath36 ( second panel ) , the mean rotation velocity along the spherical coordinate @xmath15 , @xmath37 and the 1d velocity dispersion @xmath38 ( third panel ) .",
    "the oscillatory behavior of the quantities shown in the first four panels is clear .",
    "the outflow of stellar mass from the inner region is accompanied by decreasing @xmath36 , increasing @xmath25 and @xmath35 , decreasing streaming velocity @xmath37 while increasing the velocity dispersion @xmath38 , and vice versa , that corresponds to making the bar stronger and then weaker .",
    "the amplitude of the variations decreases in time until about @xmath39 gyr when the bar experiences its first buckling episode as confirmed by the strong non - zero signal in @xmath18 and a significant increase in @xmath19 ( two lower panels ) .",
    "the surface density maps shown in figure  [ surden ] covering the time range between 1.135 and 1.84 gyr confirm that the overall effect of the process is to significantly weaken and shorten the bar .",
    "we interpret the observed behavior of the bar as due to the formation and evolution of manifold - driven spirals .",
    "manifolds were proposed as a possible origin of spiral arms and rings in barred galaxies @xcite . according to this theory , spiral",
    "arms are formed by stars on orbits confined to manifolds associated with the periodic orbits around the saddle points of the potential in the frame of reference corotating with the bar @xcite .",
    "in such a frame there are five equilibrium ( lagrange ) points at which the derivative of the effective potential vanishes .",
    "the most important for us here are the @xmath40 and @xmath41 points located along the bar major axis , near its ends .",
    "these points are saddle points and unstable causing the stars in their vicinity to escape from the neighborhood .",
    "manifolds can be interpreted as tunnels along which this escape can take place .",
    "the properties of manifolds so far were mostly studied by tracing orbits in analytically set potentials , however , @xcite demonstrated that they actually occur in full , self - consistent @xmath0-body simulations and lead to the formation of spiral arms .",
    "here we have witnessed a similar phenomenon . however ,",
    "in our case the formation of manifold - driven spirals is not a single event but seems to repeat itself a few times . around @xmath42 gyr",
    "( see the upper left panel of figure  [ surden ] ) the manifold - driven spirals form for the first time .",
    "the outflow of stars along the spiral arms seems to modify the potential near the bar sufficiently in order to move the @xmath1 points towards the center of the galaxy and thus decrease the length and strength of the bar . after the bar rebuilds itself it",
    "` emits ' a next generation of spiral arms along manifolds now located closer to the center ( the upper right panel of figure  [ surden ] ) .",
    "this shifts the position of the @xmath1 points again and the whole process repeats itself . as illustrated in the lower panel of figure  [ a2modestime ] and the first four panels of figure  [ propdetail ] , between 1 and 1.7 gyr there are at least five such cycles distinguishable . at about @xmath39",
    "gyr the bar starts to buckle for the first time so its orbital structure is substantially rebuilt and no well - defined bar - driven spiral arms form later on .",
    "interestingly , right after the damping period is finished the bar is quite short , with the length of the order of 5 kpc , as can be estimated from the drop of the @xmath43 profile to half its maximum value ( see the orange line for @xmath44 gyr in figure  [ a2profiles ] ) .",
    "in addition , it is surrounded by a family of rather irregular spiral arms of different length originating from the multiple generations of manifold - driven double spirals ( see the lower right panel of figure  [ surden ] ) .",
    "this morphology is qualitatively similar to the present spiral structure of the milky way as far as we know it @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the mechanism of bar damping we described here may have contributed to the formation of the present - day structure of the milky way .",
    "although in our simulation it occurs early in the evolution of the bar , it is quite possible that with different initial conditions and/or addition of gas physics it could be a much more recent phenomenon .",
