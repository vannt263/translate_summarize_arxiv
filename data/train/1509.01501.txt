    "accurate measurements of the reionization history of the universe plays an important role in understanding the early stages of structure and star formation .",
    "fortunately , the evolution of the inter - galactic lyman - alpha opacity measured in the spectra of quasars can provide valuable information on the reionization history  @xcite .",
    "the recent measurements suggest that the reionization of the inter - galactic medium was largely complete at redshift @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the rapid decline in the space density of lyman - alpha emitting galaxies in the region @xmath2 also implies a low - redshift reionization process  @xcite .",
    "however , the detailed evolution of the electron ionization fraction with redshift is currently unknown due to the difficulties in probing the reionization state of the universe at higher redshifts through the lyman - alpha opacity .",
    "the most promising observation in the near future is detection of the 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the 21 cm emission is a direct probe of the large - scale distribution of neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization , and is , therefore , a complementary probe to the lyman - alpha emission at lower redshifts . according to current understanding of reionization sources , high energy photons",
    "may arise from the first star - forming galaxies and quasars .",
    "the uniqueness of these objects as the sources of photons to reionize the universe is more challenging to establish .",
    "high precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies provide new insights into the reionization history .",
    "there are two main effects of reionization on the cmb angular power spectra .",
    "the first effect produces a suppression of the acoustic peaks in the cmb angular power spectra through the optical depth integrated over the whole reionization history .",
    "earlier reionization leads to the larger suppression of the acoustic peaks .",
    "the second effect changes the shape of the large - scale polarization angular power spectra .",
    "this gives a characteristic bump in the spectra on scales larger than the horizon size at reionization .",
    "the position of the bump is proportional to the square root of the redshift at which the reionization occurs , while the amplitude is proportional to the optical depth  @xcite .",
    "therefore , measurements of the large - scale polarization angular power spectra can be used to constrain the reionization history  @xcite .    current constraint on the reionization optical depth from the planck temperature data in combination with the low - multipole polarization data",
    "is @xmath3 in the base @xmath4cdm model  @xcite , which is smaller than @xmath5 estimated by the wmap 9-year data  @xcite , but consistent with that from wmap polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353 ghz polarization maps from the high frequency instrument  @xcite .",
    "these results are based on the assumption of an instantaneous reionization .",
    "if such a simple assumption is not true , the estimated values of cosmological parameters are biased .",
    "since there is currently no convincing model of the reionization history , it is important and necessary to constrain it in a relatively model - independent way .    hu and holder proposed a principal component analysis ( pca ) of the reionization history to quantity the information contained in the large - scale @xmath6-mode polarization  @xcite .",
    "the principal components are the eigenfunctions of the fisher matrix that describes the dependence of the polarization angular power spectra on the reionization history . in practice ,",
    "no more than the first five principal components are needed to parameterize the reionization history  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been applied to wmap data and simulated future data  @xcite .",
    "it is recently claimed that the harrison-zeldovich primordial spectrum is consistent with the wmap 7-year data in such a general reionization scenario  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we perform the principal component analysis of the reionization history from recently released planck 2015 data and study the impact of the reionization history on the estimates of the cosmological parameters .",
    "we also investigate the bounds on the neutrino masses and primordial tensor perturbations in a general reionization scheme .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the principal component method for parameterizing the reionization history that we will adapt in our analysis .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "since there is no convincing physical model of the reionization history , the instantaneous reionization history is usually assumed when investigating cosmological constraints from cmb measurements .",
    "such a one - parameter phenomenological model may bias the estimates of the optical depth and other cosmological parameters .",
    "in general , the hydrogen ionization fraction @xmath7 is a function of redshift . binning",
    "the hydrogen ionization fraction in redshift bins is a good idea to parameterize the reionization history .",
    "however , the degeneracy between the binned ionization fraction leads to weak constraints  @xcite .",
    "the principal component analysis provides a solution to this problem  @xcite .",
    "the pca approach is often adopted to reduce the number of variables while containing most of information of the system .",
    "it converts a set of correlated variables into a set of linear uncorrelated variables by an orthogonal transformation .",
    "the principal components are the eigenvectors of the diagonalized matrix , which are picked out according to the corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "intuitively , the larger the eigenvalue is , the more information the corresponding eigenvector gives .",
    "following  @xcite , we parameterize the reionization history . consider a binned ionization fraction @xmath8 , @xmath9 , with redshift bins of width @xmath10 spanning @xmath11 .",
    "the bin width of @xmath10 is sufficiently small so that the final results we obtain are independent of the redshift binning  @xcite .",
    "here we take @xmath12 and @xmath13 . with the definition @xmath14 and @xmath15 so that @xmath16 . for @xmath17 ,",
    "the ionization fraction is set to the residual fraction of recombination , while @xmath18 for @xmath19 consistent with astrophysical observations  @xcite and @xmath20 for @xmath21 when the helium reionization is taken into account .",
    "the principal components of @xmath8 are the eigenfunctions of the following fisher matrix @xmath22 , @xmath23 which describes the dependence of the polarization spectrum @xmath24 on the ionization fraction @xmath8 . to calculate the fisher matrix , we should set a fiducial reionization history @xmath25 as well as other cosmological parameters .",
    "the fiducial model parameters are chosen as the estimated values of cosmological parameters from the planck 2015 data including the temperature and polarization power spectra for the base @xmath4cdm model  @xcite , listed in table  [ tab : fiducial ] .",
    "we adopt @xmath26 in the range of redshifts @xmath27 to get the same optical depth as the instantanous reionization .",
    "actually our results are not sensitive to the fiducial model . since the effect of @xmath8 on @xmath24 of can be neglected on high @xmath28 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diffcee ] , we can cut off @xmath28 safely to @xmath29 in the fisher matrix .",

    "an arbitrary reionization history can be decomposed into a sum of the eigenmodes , @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the amplitudes of the principal components for a particular reionization history .",
    "we order the eigenmodes so that the smallest @xmath32 has the lowest index number @xmath37 , starting at @xmath38 .",
    "since the effect of each eigenmode on @xmath24 becomes smaller as @xmath37 increases , we shall pick out the first few eigenmodes .",

    "in our analysis we use recently released planck likelihood code and data , including the planck low-@xmath56 likelihood at multipoles @xmath57 and high-@xmath56 plik likelihood at multipoles @xmath58 based on pseudo-@xmath59 estimators .",
    "the former uses foreground - cleaned lfi 70 ghz polarization maps together with the temperature map obtained from the planck 30 to 353 ghz channels by the commander component separation algorithm over 94% of the sky .",
    "the polarization part of this likelihood is denoted as `` lowp '' .",

    "the constraint on the optical depth of the pca reionization is @xmath137 , lager than that of the instantaneous reionization obtained in the 2015 planck analysis , but with nearly the same uncertainty  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the ionization fraction at high redshift makes a larger contribution to the optical depth than at low redshift .",
    "the optical depth between any two redshifts @xmath138 and @xmath139 is an integration of @xmath140 , @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the helium abundance .",
