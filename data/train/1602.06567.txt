    "such curves appeared first in radon s paper @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and later new constructions were given by birkhoff and day in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "all these constructions are given in terms of some auxiliary euclidean background metric ( considering usual polarity and a @xmath0 rotation ) .",
    "in @xcite , martini and swanepoel gave a construction which does not need an auxiliary euclidean structure .",
    "the starting points are a curve positioned within a quadrant ( which is determined by any fixed pair of linearly independent vectors in the plane ) , a  norm \" defined in this quadrant by the curve , and a determinant form to obtain a norm in the adjacent quadrants in such a way that the union of such curve pieces ( together with the original piece reflected at the origin ) form the unit circle of a radon norm .",
    "what we propose here is like a change of this method : we construct radon curves using only convexity methods , and after that we show their desired properties when such a curve is chosen as unit circle of a normed plane .",
