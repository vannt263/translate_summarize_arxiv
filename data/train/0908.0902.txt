    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in lafeas[o@xmath2f@xmath3 @xcite with the remarkable critical temperature @xmath4 of 26 k has stimulated intense experimental and theoretical research activities towards exploring new superconducting systems and understanding the relevant physics .",

    "the stoichiometric systems can be doped with electrons or holes by appropriate substitutions in the ionic layers . without doping",
    "most of the parent systems show universal spin density wave ( sdw)-like long range magnetic order and a tetragonal to orthorhombic / monoclinic structural phase transition at low temperature .",
    "@xcite the doping supresses both the magnetic and structural phase transitions and leads to superconductivity .",

    "@xcite have shown that the electronic states around the fermi level are of predominant fe-@xmath8 character .",
    "the minor splitting of these @xmath9 bands is mainly due to the weak tetrahedral ligand field of as . the universal feature of nesting conditions for parts of fs is generally thought to be the origin of the magnetic and structural phase transitions .",
    "the missing transitions in the ( 1:1:1 ) system call for an explanation",
    ". so far metric details of the fs for all systems have not been addressed , which would be important to provide quantitative tests to the present understanding of fe - based superconductors when compared with dhva data .",
    "furthermore , the role of phonons remains important even though earlier calculations @xcite which show a rather weak electron - phonon ( e - p ) coupling , as the importance of magnetophonon coupling is revealed in a recent calculation.@xcite in this work , we investigate the electronic structure and lattice dynamics of nafeas , because of the aforementioned behavior and its simple structure .",
    "for the numerical calculations the experimental crystallographic data of nafeas at 2.5k @xcite were used .",

    "the strong fe - as covalency determines the bonding in the 2d fe - as layer , while the partial ionic bonding between na - as determines the packing of these layers .",
    "it in important to emphasize that the covalency between na and as is neglected in many studies , due to the choice of a smaller mt radius for na , which assigns some electronic states to interstitial electronic states .",

    "[ fig1 ] is very similar to that of lifeas calculated by other methods .",
    "@xcite though the detailed comparison of electronic structures of different systems is difficult due to limited data and different choices of symmetry directions , the overall agreement of the energy spectrum around the fermi level is obvious .",
    "an interesting feature which has not received much attention is the double degeneracy of all bands along x - m and r - a directions .",
    "_ @xcite have mentioned that there are two degenerate bands along the x - m direction in the ( 1:1:1:1 ) system , however , without any further discussion . as the symmetry of the x - m line is identical to that of the r - a line",

    "the symmetry groups at x and m points are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . the @xmath35 symmetry at x and the @xmath37 symmetry of points along x - m do not enforce any degeneracy of the bands , since @xmath35 and @xmath37 have only 1d representations . the @xmath36 symmetry at m , however , results in double degeneracy for bands belonging to the @xmath38 or @xmath39 representations . from m to x",
    ", this degeneracy will generally be reduced due to symmetry lowering , e.g. @xmath40 .",
    "obviously , the global double degeneracy of bands along the x - m line is not caused by the known symmetry .",
    "considering the global property of this degeneracy , a hidden symmetry needs to be investigated .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    the predominant fe-@xmath8 character of all bands within @xmath20 ev indicates that these bands originate from pure fe lattice .    , i=1,2 representing the primitive lattice vectors of the crystallographic unit cell ; @xmath41 are the primitive vectors implied by the electronic band structure .",

    "[ fig2 ] that each of the two as square lattices projects onto the center of the other lattice , each of which is crystallographically equivalent to the fe lattice .",
    "therefore a tight - binding energy dispersion for a fe-@xmath9 band can be derived from a @xmath42 secular matrix as follows , @xmath43 where the indices 1,2 indicate fe1 and fe2 atoms in the unit cell , respectively .",
    "the on - site energy @xmath44 of the chosen orbital is calculated up to the second nearest neighbors , and is given for the x - m line , by @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the on - site energy , nearest neighbor , and second nearest neighbor hopping integrals between fe1-d orbitals , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 $ ] specifies a @xmath48 point along the x - m line with @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the reciprocal lattice vectors corresponding to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "an interesting result is that @xmath54 for @xmath48 points on the x - m line . in the tight - binding approximation",
    "the conditions of @xmath44 and @xmath54 result in a doubly degenerate band dispersion along the x - m line , i.e. @xmath55 .    [ [ section-3 ] ]    in fact , if only fe bands are concerned , a smaller unit cell as shown in fig . [ fig2 ] for the fe sub - lattice , with the unit cell vectors , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 can be found , which results in a double sized first bz with the x - m line as an internal line . when the reduced zone scheme is used to represent the bands ,",
    "the bands in the large bz will be folded into the smaller bz as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by the reciprocal lattice vector .",
    "accordingly the degeneracy of the boundary states will be doubled , as can be easily understood from the one - dimensional superstructure case .",
    "@xcite    [ [ section-4 ] ]    it is obvious that the band - folding explanation can not be directly applied to the as bands or to the fe , as hybridized bands , since the as sublattice can not be described by @xmath59 .",
    "the two as atoms in the unit cell are connected by a glide plane operation .",
    "to understand the double degeneracy of these bands along x - m , we analyze the hamiltonian matrix constructed by tight - binding approximation .",
    "we do not attempt to solve the whole secular problem which is a @xmath60 matrix , if all na-@xmath14 , as-@xmath61 , and fe-@xmath62 orbitals are considered .",
    "instead we investigate the most representative and important subblock by exploiting the symmetry .",
    "guided by the electronic structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we consider in the following the as-@xmath63 and fe-@xmath9 orbitals only . by accounting for the @xmath37 symmetry of the x - m line , we choose the @xmath64 subblock as an example . as only @xmath65 and",
    "@xmath66 belong to the @xmath64 irreducible representation , we attain a @xmath67 matrix secular problem : @xmath68 where the hamiltonian matrix elements in both the rows and columns are arranged in the order of fe1 , fe2 , as1 and as2 ( fig . [ fig2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "obviously the upper @xmath42 diagonal subblock corresponds to the fe sublattice , while the lower diagonal subblock corresponds to the as sublattice .",
    "though the as sublattice has a different symmetry as compared to the fe sublattice , their tight - binding hamiltonian matrix have the same diagonal structure .",
    "our calculations based on the structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] indicate that @xmath69 , while @xmath70 calculated up to the 2nd nearest neighbors of as is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the onsite energy , nearest neighbor , second nearest neighbor hopping integrals between as1-@xmath65 orbitals , respectively .",
    "the similarity between the fe , as subblocks of the secular matrix suggests that the bands of the as sublattice should also be doubly degenerate along the x - m line . when the fe - as interactions are taken into account , the situation becomes more complicated , because there are non - zero off - diagonal matrix elements . under the aforementioned approximations , the matrix elements @xmath73 and @xmath74 are obtained",
    "@xmath75 is found to be equal to the complex conjugate of @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath75=@xmath76 , and is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , are the nearest neighbor , second nearest neighbor hopping integrals between as1-@xmath65 and fe2-@xmath66 orbital , respectively .",
    "simple algebraic operations of the @xmath80 secular matrix equation lead to the following reduced problem : @xmath81 since @xmath82 , eq . [ eq5 ] which is of fourth order is reduced to two identical equations , resulting in two identical sets of roots , namely , @xmath83 this result provides an explanation for the double degeneracy of bands along x - m line . as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ eq6 ] if the coupling between fe and as sublattices is removed , i.e. @xmath84 , the situations of pure fe and as lattices are recovered . within our tight - binding model ,",
    "the occurrence of zero matrix elements and their positions are essential to the double degeneracy .",
    "our calculations show that this is a combined result for the site symmetry of fe , as and the special direction x - m , which makes the terms @xmath85 , @xmath86 with @xmath87 , always occur in pairs and thus cancels with each other , where @xmath88 indicates the position of the target atom for the hopping integral of interest .",
    "this conclusion holds even when the interlayer hopping terms are included , because @xmath89 is perpendicular to @xmath48 along the x - m and r - a directions , and the algebraic structure of the secular matrix remains unchanged .",
    "therefore , for the bands along x - m or r - a the system can be described with the smaller unit cell as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . granted other conditions remain unchanged , the reduction of a unit cell implies a higher symmetry in the sense that more translational operations are allowed .",
    "the global degeneracy of bands along x - m and r - a directions simply infers an instability of the system .     with @xmath90-z as their center axis .",
    "the last two objects of electronic nature center at m with m - a as their center axis .",
    "the arrows on the surface show both the magnitude and direction of the velocity field mapped onto the fs .",
    "the first bz used throughout this work is shown below the fs . ]      the calculated fs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is composed of a small ovoid ball , two large tubes with hole character around @xmath90 and the other two tubes with electron character around m , respectively .",
    "qualitatively these features agree quite well with those of other systems.@xcite a simple visual inspection reveals possible fermi surface nesting between the hole tubes around @xmath90 and electron tubes around m corresponding to a vector of ( 1/2,1/2,0 ) . the calculated group velocities of electrons / holes are mapped onto the fermi surface as shown in fig .",

    "the reason for this difference needs to be clarified in future work since there are many similarities between the two systems .",
