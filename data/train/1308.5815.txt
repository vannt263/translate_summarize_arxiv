    "fidelity plays a fundamental role in classical  @xcite and quantum  @xcite communication theories as a quantitative measure of the accuracy of imperfect transmission of signals through a communication channel .",
    "fidelity has also other basic applications in quantum information , quantum optics , and even condensed - matter physics .",
    "the most popular definition of fidelity between two mixed quantum states @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( corresponding to , e.g. , the input and output states of a communication channel ) was given by uhlmann  @xcite and jozsa  @xcite as @xmath2 ^ 2 , \\label{fidelity}\\ ] ] which is also referred to as the uhlmann transition probability  @xcite .",
    "to avoid confusion , we note that the root fidelity @xmath3 is sometimes referred to as the fidelity ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the fidelity vanishes for orthogonal states and is equal to 1 for identical states .",
    "if one of the states is pure , say @xmath4 , then the fidelity simplifies to @xmath5 .",
    "the fidelity has a few important and useful properties including  @xcite ( a ) bounds @xmath6 , ( b ) symmetry @xmath7 , ( c ) unitary invariance [ i.e. , @xmath8 for an arbitrary unitary operator @xmath9 , ( d ) multiplicativity [ e.g. , @xmath10 , ( e ) concavity , and ( f ) joint concavity .",
    "a physical interpretation of the fidelity as a measure of distinguishability can be given as follows  @xcite : in a decoherence scenario , based on purifications instead of collapses of states , an arbitrary mixed state @xmath11 can be given by a _ pure _",
    "state @xmath12 of a subsystem @xmath13 entangled with some larger system ( environment ) @xmath14 , which is reduced to @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath15",
    ". then the fidelity corresponds to the maximum taken over all such purifications @xmath16 of states @xmath17 for @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "the fidelity is simply related to the bures metric  @xcite ( the helstrom metric  @xcite ) as @xmath20 $ ] , which can be considered a quantum generalization of the fisher information metric .",
    "the bures metric can be used to quantify quantum entanglement  @xcite , nonclassicality  @xcite , and polarization  @xcite .",
    "the braunstein - caves distinguishability metric  @xcite , defined via the bures metric , is a useful tool of quantum estimation theory .",
    "entanglement measures based on the bures metric are also useful for identifying and characterizing quantum phase transitions , e.g. , as indicators of their criticality  @xcite .",
    "an important question arises as to how to measure the fidelity @xmath21 ( or its bounds ) between two mixed states .",
    "obviously , one can apply a method for quantum state tomography for the complete reconstruction of the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 . then , with this knowledge , the fidelity can be calculated explicitly . however , this approach is extremely inefficient as it requires measuring redundant information to finally determine just a single value of the fidelity .",
    "note that the fidelity , given by eq .",
    "( [ fidelity ] ) , between two _ mixed _ states is difficult not only to measure directly but even to calculate analytically .",
    "we note that analytical formulas for the fidelity are known only for a few types of states including single - qubit states  @xcite and multimode gaussian states  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we show how to directly measure the super- and subfidelities which are , respectively , the upper and lower bounds on the fidelity @xmath21 between two arbitrary two - qubit mixed states @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we describe here an experimental method for measuring the purity @xmath22 , which is a degree of information about the preparation of a quantum state @xmath23 as defined by the trace norm of @xmath23 : @xmath24 the purity ranges from @xmath25 for completely mixed states @xmath26 of dimension @xmath27 to @xmath28 for pure states . by recalling deep mathematical and physical similarities between the classical optical polarizations and qubits",
    ", one can conclude that the classical degree of polarization and the quantum purity of a qubit are close analogs  @xcite .    on the other hand , the lack of information about the preparation of a given state , which is referred to as the mixedness , can be quantified by entropic measures , such as the von neumann and bastiaans - tsallis entropies , including the linear entropy @xmath29 , which is a linear approximation to the von neumann entropy .",
    "the linear entropy can be considered a measure of quantum entanglement of a bipartite pure state if one of the subsystems is traced out . for two - qubit mixed states , the relation between the linear entropy and ( i ) the von neumann entropy , ( ii ) the entanglement of formation ( which is a canonical measure of entanglement ) , and ( iii ) the violations of the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality were studied in , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . a comparative analysis of the mixedness ( as measured by the linear and von neumann entropies ) and quantum noise ( as described by the squeezing and fano factors ) was given in a dynamical scenario in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that the purity @xmath30 is a special case of the first - order overlap function @xmath31 which is equivalent to the purity if @xmath32 .",
    "general methods to measure any polynomial function of a density matrix were described by ekert _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and brun  @xcite .",
    "while these approaches would also enable a direct measurement of the purity in a special case , it is not clear whether they enable efficient experimental implementations ( except , e.g. , the single - qubit purity measurements  @xcite ) . indeed , as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite : `` this proof of principle is very far from being a proof that such a measurement is practical . ''",
    "these general approaches consist of using various two - qubit and single - qubit gates such as the controlled - swap or controlled - not and hadamard gates .",
    "note that the success probability of the discrete - variable controlled - not and controlled - swap gates with linear optics is limited , e.g. , it is usually equal to 1/9 assuming no additional ancillae and feedforward ( see ref .",

    "the density matrix of a single qubit in the bloch representation can be written compactly as @xmath35 by using the einstein summation convention .",

    "we can see that a single - qubit density matrix can be obtained after tracing out the second qubit from the two - qubit density matrix .",
    "thus , in this article we focus on quartits , bearing in mind that the qubit case can be obtained simply after taking one of the qubits out of the picture .",

    "the situation is quite different .",
    "nevertheless , we can use the upper and lower bounds on the fidelity , given by  @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 ^ 2 - 2{\\mathrm{tr}}[(\\rho_1\\rho_2)^2]},\\hspace{4 mm } \\label{e}\\\\ g(\\rho_1,\\rho_2)= { \\mathrm{tr}}(\\rho_1\\rho_2 ) + \\sqrt{[1-{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\rho_1 ^ 2)][1-\\mathrm{tr(}\\rho_2 ^ 2)]},\\hspace{1 cm } \\label{g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which are referred to as the subfidelity and superfidelity , respectively .",
    "these formulas can be rewritten as @xmath51}.\\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , to measure these bounds directly , we need to measure the first - order overlap @xmath33 , given by eq .",
    "( [ overlap1 ] ) , and the second - order overlap @xmath52 together with the linear entropies ( purities ) , @xmath53 ( for @xmath18 ) , which are the special cases of @xmath33 .",
    "let us note that if ( at least ) one of the states @xmath54 is pure , then the superfidelity is equal to the fidelity and is given only by the first term , i.e. , the overlap @xmath33 .",
    "thus , after finding that either @xmath0 or @xmath1 is pure , the fidelity can be found by measuring the overlap @xmath33 only .    in any other case the fidelity @xmath55 can be estimated as an average of the subfidelity @xmath14 and superfidelity @xmath56 with some certain error .",
    "the error can be minimized in two ways : ( i ) by finding tighter measurable bounds on the fidelity or ( ii ) by using the best expression for the mean value ( arithmetic , harmonic , geometric , etc . ) . in our article",
    "we focus only on this second aspect and numerically optimize the generalized mean ( power mean ) defined as @xmath57^{\\frac{1}{m}},\\label{mean}\\ ] ] which for balanced weights @xmath58 , and in special cases for @xmath59 , becomes the harmonic , geometric , and arithmetic mean , while for @xmath60 it reduces to @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "thus , the generalized mean is bounded from below by @xmath14 and from above by @xmath56 , i.e. , for @xmath62 @xmath63 from our monte carlo simulation for @xmath64 pairs of random two - qubit states ( as shown in fig .  [ fig:0 ] ) we found with the method of least squares that the optimal @xmath65 and @xmath66 providing the smallest estimation error @xmath67 , which is an improvement in comparison to the arithmetic mean providing @xmath68 .",
    "our method of calculating means is not the most general one ( e.g. , one can use a generalized @xmath69 mean ) .",
    "however , one must remember that true fidelity values are to be found between @xmath14 and @xmath56 , so the maximal estimation error is greater than the error average .",
    "we focus on the analysis of nonlinear properties of two - qubit states because they play an important role in quantum protocols exploiting quantum correlations .",
    "thus , establishing methods of testing various properties of these states is well motivated .",
    "this is especially important for photonic qubits since photons are typical carriers of quantum information used in quantum communication protocols .",
    "the purity @xmath30 can be observed directly if we assume that we have access to two copies of the two - qubit system .",
    "the first - order overlap ( or the purity in the special case for @xmath70 ) can be calculated directly as @xmath71,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 are the correlation matrices of @xmath73 for @xmath74 , as defined below eq .",

    "note that @xmath82 matrices are traceless except for @xmath83 ; thus @xmath84 hence , we can rewrite eq .",

    "hence , the overlap is a real observable measured on a system consisting of two copies of the investigated state @xmath23 .",
    "let us note that measuring the purity is , thus , equivalent to measuring a product of @xmath98 operators , which was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be experimentally accessible using linear optics .",
    "if the two - qubit state is produced at frequency @xmath99 , we delay every second state @xmath23 and we can measure the product of @xmath98 operators directly as shown in fig .",

    "useful values of @xmath106 appear for @xmath107 of the cases when the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are delivered , assuming that @xmath108 is the quantum efficiency of the detectors .",
    "the obtained expectation value of the overlap reads @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 is the kronecker @xmath78 . as for any measurement",
    ", equality is reached in the limit of @xmath112 .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated how the first - order overlap @xmath33 and the purity @xmath30 can be measured directly .",
    "the setup in fig .  [ fig : purity ] provides a simple way to understand how the entire purity measurement protocol works .",
    "it is , however , impractical from the experimental point of view .",
    "first of all , it requires eight detectors that have to be calibrated to give the same detection efficiency .",

    "@xcite , where its authors make use of hong - ou - mandel interference and a singlet - state projection performed by a balanced beam splitter to determine the two - photon overlap . in a special case",
    "this technique can be adapted for measuring the purity of a single qubit .",
    "a similar setup was used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors described direct and indirect purity measurements of a single qubit .",
    "they presented two separate strategies , one corresponding to a direct measurement using many consecutive pairs of the investigated state and the second corresponding to the standard quantum state tomography based on polarization projection measurements . since the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite were dealing with the measurement of single qubits , their setup requires fewer resources than the scheme presented in our paper dedicated to two - qubit purity measurements .",
    "our @xmath98 block is in fact the hong - ou - mandel dip known since the famous experiment of ref .",
    "indeed , the hong - ou - mandel two - photon interferometer has been used to implement a projection on a singlet state , for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , with the development of experimental techniques , the four alternative implementations of the @xmath98 block suitable for various platforms ( including bulk , fiber , and integrated optics ) have their merit .    as mentioned before ,",
    "a few experiments on single - qubit purity have already been performed but , since there are additional interesting features ( including entanglement ) arising from the transition from one to two qubits , our proposals for direct measurement of the two - qubit purity can be an important tool for future investigations in quantum optical engineering and information processing .",
    "concerning the two - photon overlap measurements , we note another formal method of ekert _ et al . _",
    "@xcite based on programmable quantum networks with controlled - swap gates for estimating both linear and nonlinear functionals of arbitrary states . as shown explicitly by miszczak _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , this network method also enables the measurement , in a special case , of the first- and second - order overlaps between a pair of two - qubit states for the estimation of their fidelity bounds . this formal method , although in principle scalable for any number of qubits , has not been applied ( even theoretically ) to any physical system .",
    "in contrast , we apply a purely algebraic method for estimating some specific functionals of states and describe an experimentally - friendly linear - optical implementation of our method . as in these related works  @xcite",
    ", we assumed that we have access to two copies of a given quantum state , which can be implemented either by producing two identical states simultaneously , or by storing the state produced earlier in order to measure it together with the second copy of the state available later . concerning the optical measurement of the purity , our proposal requires fewer experimental resources than of bovino _ et al . _",
    "specifically , our setup requires only four instead of six detectors and only two beam splitters instead of four used in ref .",
    "every additional experimental resource complicates the operation of the setup and is a possible source of imperfections .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] we have presented several experimentally - friendly strategies based on our original method .",
    "all these setups represent a viable alternative to be considered in practical experimental implementations of the protocol .",
    "we can not claim that one of them is superior to the others since each of them has its advantages and drawbacks .",
    "the choice would depend on the preferred features .",
    "for instance , if the success rate is an issue , experimentalists would probably choose the second strategy ( with a success rate up to 1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , for the highest experimental stability and precision ( in bulk optics , rather than in fiber optics ) , the fourth strategy might be selected .",
    "moreover , the third strategy would be a good choice for a fiber - optical implementation , while the second strategy can be suitable for integrated optics .",
    "moreover , we performed a monte carlo simulation of @xmath64 mixed two - qubit states and applied the method of least squares to estimate the fidelity as a generalized power mean of these fidelity bounds with the minimum average estimation error .",
    "experimentalists frequently use the fidelity ( usually determined by applying quantum tomography ) as a measure of the quality of their achievements .",
    "remarkable progress has been observed over the past decade as the reported experimental values increased from 0.58 to 0.98 .",
    "however , it should be stressed that both the purity and fidelity are important parameters for characterizing experimental achievements with respect to quantum operations .",
    "the purity alone would not be adequate to describe how well the gate performs the requested task ( for instance the controlled not operation ) . similarly to that , the fidelity can be indeed rather high even though the purity has dropped and therefore the gate is misaligned , which typically occurs in the case of active stabilization issues . as pointed out recently in ref .",
    "@xcite to have 98% fidelity is not enough to be sure that the two states are indeed similar or close to each other .",
    "the answer depends on the specific situation and additional information about the state is needed .",
