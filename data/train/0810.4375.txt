    "the brightest portion of ngc 1976 , the orion nebula , is commonly called the huygens region ( after , who published the first drawing ) and its form in three dimensions was the subject of many early papers ( reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the presently accepted basic model of a photoionized thin layer of gas flowing off the side of the orion molecular cloud ( omc ) facing us was invoked to explain the progressive blueshift of the emission lines with respect to the omc @xcite .",
    "the bright bar along the southeast border of the huygens region is a location where the main ionization front ( mif ) is tilted almost along the line of sight to the observer .",
    "the other portions of the mif have been mapped in three dimensions ( 3-d ) by @xcite by a method that assumes all the ionizing radiation arises from the star @xmath0ori  c , and then calculates the distance to the mif that would satisfy the known conditions of gas density and observed h@xmath30surface brightness , this being a broader application of a method first presented in @xcite . although this 3-d map has the limitation that it becomes progressively less accurate as one moves away from the line of sight towards @xmath0ori  c , it did establish that @xmath0ori  c  lies about 0.2  pc in front of the mif , it confirmed the structure in the bright bar region , and showed that the nebula was otherwise a concave surface with a large bump to the southwest of @xmath0ori  c  in the orion - s star formation region .",
    "the surface brightness near @xmath0ori  c  can be explained as emission by a constant density layer of about 0.1  pc @xcite .",
    "this is only a reference number since the emissivity must be much higher near the mif and drop as the square of the density . in a nebula where there is free expansion of the photoionized gas and",
    "there is a single dominant ionizing star , a concave shape of the mif is the natural result , with bumps , valleys , and ridges reflecting underlying conditions of the host molecular cloud .",
    "the ionization front is expected to be closer to the ionizing star where the molecular cloud density is higher and further where the underlying density is lower .",
    "the ionized gas density drops rapidly away from the mif , but it is not clear what the density is in the immediate vicinity of @xmath0ori  c  since it is expected that its intense high velocity wind would create a hot low density cavity around it . this cavity has not been detected directly except for observations of stand - off shocks in front of the proplyds closest to @xmath0ori  c@xcite .",
    "in addition to the rich orion nebula cluster ( onc ) centered on the bright trapezium stars , there are two star formation centers imbedded in the omc .",
    "the first is associated with the deeply imbedded ( 0.2 pc , @xcite ) bn - kl infrared and radio sources to the northwest of @xmath0ori  c  and the second in the orion - s region .    with the discovery of 21 cm absorption lines in the radio continuum spectrum",
    "@xcite it was recognized that there was a veil of neutral material on the observer s side of the nebula and subsequent absorption line spectroscopy @xcite established its physical characteristics and approximate location of about one parsec on the observer s side ( henceforth foreground ) of @xmath0ori  c. the huygens region occupies the northeast corner of a much larger structure called the extended orion nebula ( eon , @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that there is a systematic flow of ionized material into the eon @xcite , but the lower surface brightness has limited the number of investigations of this region @xcite . however , the eon is the location of two x - ray bright regions of hot plasma @xcite .",
    "high resolution optical @xcite and infrared @xcite images of the eon are now available .",
    "although these images show many interesting large - scale features , there is neither the detail nor abundance of stars of the huygens region .    in this paper",
    "we will present the most relevant information about the onc and the orion nebula , then integrate this into a modified picture of the orion nebula s 3-d structure and its history . in ",
    "2 we present the most useful information , then give the results of where this information leads in   3 .",
    "the huygens region has been the subject of numerous imaging studies .",
    "arguably the most useful groundbased study is that of @xcite , which utilized a fabry - perot system to isolate emission from the h@xmath30 , h@xmath31 , [ @xmath4 5007   , [ @xmath8 6583   and 6548   , [ @xmath5 6716    and 6731   , and [ @xmath20 ] 6678   lines .",
    "@xcite presented a mosaic of hubble space telescope ( hst ) wfpc2 images at the superior resolution of the hst .",
    "the particular advantage of the hst images is that the wfpc2 images allow clear discrimination of not only the isolated [ @xmath4 5007   line , but also both the h@xmath30  6563   line and the nearby [ @xmath8 6583   line in addition to the filters being narrow enough that they provide a good isolation of the emission lines against the strong scattered light continuum that primarily arises from in the dense region immediately beyond the mif @xcite . a later hst survey @xcite with the acs camera covered a wider field of view with pixels one half the angular size of those in the wfpc2 , but",
    ", the filters used do nt allow a clear delineation of the important emission lines @xcite .",
    "the huygens region has been mapped with the vla at about 1.7  resolution @xcite at the extinction free 20.5 cm continuum . by comparing the surface brightness calibrated @xcite images and the radio images , it was possible to derive a map of the optical extinction across the huygens region and to generate extinction - corrected versions of the hst wfpc2 emission line images @xcite .",
    "in this study we employ the several forms of the wfpc2 images , all processed in part using the iraf package .",
    "we see in figure 1 that the orion - s region to the southwest of the trapezium resembles the bright bar region in being enhanced in low ionization [ @xmath8 emission and being much brighter than adjacent areas",
    ". these characteristics are consistent with the brightest part of the central huygens region being both closer to @xmath0ori  c  and also being an inclined face of ionized gas .",
    "this picture is consistent with the results of the 3-d modeling of @xcite .",
    "although the optical extinction of the veil has been recognized for some time , it has been established only recently @xcite that most of this extinction arises from the near side of the ionized zone and not within it .",
    "the detailed analysis of @xcite established that the physical conditions in the two 21 cm @xmath23 absorption velocity components of the veil are rather different , the energy density in their component a being dominated by the magnetic field measured from the zeeman effect .",
    "there must be a secondary ionization front associated with the veil and on the far side ( away from the observer and closer to @xmath0ori  c ) of the veil .",
    "@xcite identify emission lines probably arising from the veil s ionization front .",
    "the radial velocities of the various emission and absorption line components along the line of sight through the trapezium are summarized in table 1 .",
    "an early study @xcite at 16  resolution detected h@xmath28coin absorption against the radio continuum with the location identified as orion - s , a region with multiple known molecular emission lines @xcite and well defined bipolar molecular outflows in co @xcite and sio @xcite . a higher resolution ( @xmath33 ) study @xcite confirmed the presence of this absorption feature and the results are shown in figure 1 and table 1 . in figure 1 we see that the h@xmath28co  absorption is distinct from the bipolar outflows , the strongest infrared and radio sources , and the sources of the high velocity optical outflows @xcite .",
    "@xcite point out that the presence of h@xmath28co  in absorption means that the cloud containing it must lie in front of the ionized gas , a position also taken in more general form by @xcite and @xcite . since h@xmath28co  can only exist in a cold dense gas that is optically thick to fuv ( and therefore also euv ) radiation , there will be a corresponding high extinction at visual wavelengths .",
    "therefore , we have looked for optical extinction associated with this feature with the results described in the next section .      the optical appearance of the huygens region is strongly affected by extinction occurring within the veil .",
    "the clearest example is the dark bay feature to the east - northeast of the trapezium .",
    "this extinction generally decreases away from the dark bay as the line of sight is moved to the southwest .",
    "the extinction has been derived in several fashions .",
    "in slit spectroscopy , the common approach has been to compare the flux ratios of the strongest balmer series lines with the ratios expected from theoretical predictions calculated for the local conditions ( primarily the electron temperature ) .",
    "a good example of this is the study of @xcite , who obtained sample spectra along a well - defined east - west path beginning about 30  west of @xmath0ori  cand derived the extinction from comparing paschen lines with h@xmath34 .",
    "the highest spatial resolution study is that of @xcite , where calibrated hst wfpc2 h@xmath30  and h@xmath31  images from a single wfpc2 pointing to the southwest of the trapezium were compared with theory .",
    "pixel by pixel extinction corrections were obtained as part of a study of electron temperature fluctuations .",
    "the widest field of view high resolution determination of the extinction was that of @xcite who compared the h@xmath30  surface brightness of a mosaic of gaussian blurred hst wfpc2 images with vla 20 cm images obtained at 1.7  resolution .",
    "in all these studies similar extinction curves were used @xcite .",
    "the derived extinction is commonly expressed as @xmath35 , the logarithm of the extinction at 4861   , the wavelength of h@xmath31 . in this work",
    "we will refer to the @xmath35  value derived from the comparison of the radio continuum and h@xmath30  as @xmath36and to the value derived from comparison of wfpc2 balmer h@xmath30  and h@xmath31  images as @xmath37 , while the difference of the two will be @xmath38 .    although a comparison of the results for @xmath36  and @xmath37  for nine well - sampled smaller regions showed that there was a good agreement of the results of the two methods for finding @xmath35  ( ratio of 0.93@xmath110.19,@xcite",
    ", there is reason to expect that the two methods should not agree exactly",
    ".    the first reason would be the effect of scattering of the optical lines by dust in the dense photon dominated region ( pdr ) that lies immediately beyond the mif .",
    "this scattering is what produces a broad redshifted component in the high resolution spectra of the intrinsically narrower heavy ion emission lines and it must also be present in the balmer lines . this is why the continuum of the orion nebula is much stronger than expected from simply atomic processes @xcite , in effect , the orion nebula is also a bright reflection nebula .",
    "one would expect the effect of this process to cause an underestimate of @xmath36  and would affect @xmath37  less since one is dealing with only the difference in the amount of scattering of the h@xmath30  and h@xmath31   lines , rather than the absolute amount at h@xmath30 , as done in deriving @xmath36 . taking the fraction of the light scattered in the forbidden lines , this position dependent effect should only be a few hundredths in the logarithm ( dex ) .",
    "the second reason to expect @xmath39  to be non - zero is that when using only the optical emission ( the balmer line ratio method ) one is dealing entirely with radiation that has not suffered a large amount of extinction , whereas the radio continuum to h@xmath30  method can be thrown off by the fact that some of the total radio continuum is produced by volumes behind regions that are very optically thick to h@xmath30 . in this case",
    ", one would be using a radio signal from all along the line of sight but h@xmath30  emission from only in front of the obscuring material and @xmath36  would be too large , i.e. @xmath39  would be positive",
    ".    the third reason for a difference would be variations in the ratio of total to selective extinction .",
    "derivation of @xmath37  depends upon the reddening curve adopted , which is primarily determined by the ratio of total to selective extinction , while @xmath36  is less dependent on this ratio .    since the presence of h@xmath28co  in absorption indicates that near orion - s there is a region where radio continuum emission occurs in part behind the totally obscuring cloud , we looked for significant variations in @xmath39  in the region southwest of the trapezium where this could be done .",
    "the results are also shown in figure 1 , where we have superimposed the contours of large values of @xmath39 .",
    "one sees that there are two regions where @xmath39  is large , the northerly one nearly coinciding with the h@xmath28co  absorption and the other coinciding with the distinct obscuring feature to its south designated as the sw cloud @xcite .",
    "this means that in both these regions optical emission lines are recording only part of the ionized gas along the lines of sight . another way of wording this is that in these regions the model of the mif front based on a single dominant emitting layer can not be accurate .",
    "since the @xcite study used the reddening corrected h@xmath30  line for reference , in these regions the model will be a depiction of the closer ( to the observer ) emitting region .",
    "this means that the `` bump '' in the orion - s region is there , but it is not simply the result of a nearer part of the mif , but , it is an isolated optically thick feature directly ionized on its surface by @xmath0ori  c  and behind it is another ionized region .",
    "the more southerly region of large @xmath39  is probably similar , but it must not be as dense as the orion - s feature since one does not see h@xmath28co  in absorption .      nature provides a way of probing where material is located within the orion nebula through the ionization shadows created beyond the proplyds . in a study of linear features within the orion nebula and the helix nebula , @xcite established that these features can occur when there is a single dominant ionizing star and an intervening object optically thick to the euv lyman continuum ( lyc ) radiation .",
    "the first order theory for this situation had already been determined @xcite .",
    "gaseous material lying beyond an object like a proplyd ( in the orion nebula ) or a knot ( in the helix nebula ) will be shadowed from photoionizing lyc photons coming directly from the ionizing star , but will be exposed to lyc photons produced through the recombination of surrounding nebular gas .",
    "this diffuse radiation field will be a small fraction of the direct radiation from the ionizing star and there will be fewer higher energy photons than in the direct radiation .",
    "the difference in the radiation field is because the recombinations occur preferentially to energy states just above hydrogen s ionization threshold .",
    "the lower density of ionizing photons means a lower rate of photoionization and the different energy distribution means that any shadowed gas will equilibrate at a lower electron temperature .",
    "the lower temperature means that forbidden line radiation will have a reduced emissivity and recombination lines will have an increased emissivity .",
    "this shows up particularly well when looking at the ratio of images in [ @xmath4 and h@xmath30 , as shown in figure 2 and figure 3 .",
    "@xcite established that the linear rays seen in the [ @xmath4]/h@xmath30  image occurred along lines of sight passing through @xmath0ori  c  and a proplyd , but not all proplyds have visible radiation shadows .",
    "ori  c  and dotted lines depict significant nearly linear features that do not project back to @xmath0ori  c. almost all of the solid - line features have an identified proplyd which is the occulting source and in this case the designation of the proplyd is given , adjacent to the proplyd s position .",
    "the exception to this rule is the ionization shadow feature lying beyond the hh 202-s shock .",
    "the white dashed line shows the boundary where radial shadows begin .",
    "[ ratio ] ]    these shadowed regions will only appear when there is material present .",
    "this means that the absence of a radiation shadow indicates that only low density gas lies within that conic column . in the case where the radiation shadow does not begin at the proplyd ,",
    "then the the start of the radiation shadow must be of low density .",
    "figure 2 has had all the linear and nearly linear features traced , solid lines being used for the indistinguishably linear features and dashed lines the nearly linear ( which can not be radiation shadows unless second order effects discussed in @xcite are in play ) .",
    "one sees that in essentially every case of a linear feature there is an identified shadowing proplyd and , again , that not all proplyds have radiation shadows . in many cases ,",
    "the associated proplyd is well inside the radiation shadow ( closer to @xmath0ori  c ) .",
    "the general pattern is clear , none of the proplyds near @xmath0ori  c  have radiation shadows extending close to them and the proplyds with closely approaching radiation shadows are distant from @xmath0ori  c. we interpret this to mean that there is a region of low density ( or very different ambient condition ) gas lying within the approximate boundary shown in figure 2 .",
    "this irregular boundary in the plane of the sky is the projection along the line of sight and the central cavity is probably somewhat larger than the outlined boundary .",
    "the irregular boundary drawn indicates that there is an asymmetric distribution about the dominant ionizing star @xmath0ori  c.    it should be noted that the high velocity feature hh 202-s also casts a radiation shadow .",
    "this indicates that this shock produces a sufficiently high density that it is optically thick to lyc photons and becomes a local ionization front within a generally ionized volume .",
    "this vitiates any argument that hh 202 was caused by high velocity material from the orion - s region impinging on either the foreground veil or a section of the mif that had curved towards the observer and intercepted the collimated outflow .      within the paradigm of the orion nebula",
    "being described to first order as a relatively thin blister of ionized gas on the @xmath0ori  c   side of the mif , one expects that the [ @xmath8 emitting zone will be quite narrow as compared with the h@xmath30   emitting zone , which includes all of the ionized gas .",
    "[ @xmath4 emission must arise from closer to @xmath0ori  c  and over a larger volume since the effective temperature of @xmath0ori  c  is insufficient to produce a he@xmath19 zone ( where o@xmath19 has been ionized and [ @xmath4 is not emitted ) .",
    "this means that the [ @xmath8/h@xmath30  ratio is a good indicator of when the mif is highly tilted with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "this is the reason why the bright bar feature is so well delineated in the left panel of figure 3 .",
    "although there are many unexplained features of the bright bar , the overwhelming evidence is that it is an escarpment in the mif where we see almost along the local ionization front .",
    "this is probably also the correct interpretation of the low ionization zone to the southwest of the trapezium that lies on the northeast side of orion - s .",
    "figure 3 reveals an unexpected large scale structure in a c - shaped zone of low [ @xmath8/h@xmath30  with @xmath0ori  c  located near its middle .",
    "close examination of figure 3 indicates that where [ @xmath8 emission is weak , [ @xmath4 emission is strong .",
    "this means that the c shaped zone is an ionization phenomenon .",
    "the fact that the [ @xmath8 deficit and [ @xmath4 excess is an irregular line , rather than a closed area , indicates that this is a shell of high ionization .",
    "henceforth we will call this the [ @xmath4 shell , with full recognition that this feature is probably not closed and we do not understand its three dimensional characteristics . south of the trapezium and orion - s lies a large high ionization feature labeled as big arc south and big arc east .",
    "this was originally discovered in a low velocity resolution study @xcite , then included in a later higher resolution study @xcite , and the correct interpretation as a partial shell blueshifted about @xmath40  = 9 @xmath41  being presented in @xcite and confirmed by our remeasuring a sample of the big arc from the [ @xmath4 spectra data set @xcite .    the approximate alignment of the boundaries of the radiation shadows and the [ @xmath4 shell argues that this is an incomplete shell with lower central density within the larger mass of ionized gas .",
    "it is not an ionization boundary because one does not see [ @xmath8 enhancement on its outer perimeter .",
    "the feature seems to open to the west - southwest , being most open in the direction of orion - s .",
    "there is a nearly linear border to the high ionization zone , which labeled in figure 3 as the se - nw ionization boundary .",
    "it is not immediately obvious that this feature is an ionization boundary or caused by the higher extinction of the foreground orion - s cloud ( cf .  ",
    "3.1 )    figure 3 also shows the boundary of the radiation shadows from figure 2 and we see that there is good agreement of this boundary with the [ @xmath4 shell , which further strengthens the argument that this [ @xmath4 excess traces the outer boundary of a volume of low gas density .",
    "we also show in figure 3 the location of proplyds with stand - off shocks and find that all of them fall within the c - shaped [ @xmath4 shell . since it is most likely that these stand - off shocks are formed by direct exposure to the high velocity stellar wind of @xmath0ori  c , this argues that the [ @xmath4 shell is created by that stellar wind , an idea developed in   3.1 .",
    "the average hydrogen number density of the [ @xmath4 shell , @xmath43 , can be estimated from the h@xmath30 surface - brightness ( @xmath44 ) , given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the path length of the line of sight through the shell and @xmath47 is the electron fraction .",
    "both hydrogen and helium are assumed to be singly ionized , with @xmath48 @xcite , so that @xmath49 .",
    "the effective line recombination coefficient @xmath50 has a very weak density dependence and can be approximated in the case  b limit as @xmath51 @xcite , where @xmath52 . for a spherical shell of radius @xmath53 and fractional thickness @xmath54",
    ", the maximum path length through the shell is @xmath55 .",
    "the observed radius and thickness of the [ @xmath4 shell vary with pa by about 50% but we will take @xmath56 , @xmath57 as typical of the well - defined northern arm of the shell , so that @xmath58 .",
    "the surface brightness of the shell is most easily estimated from the sharp brightness jump at the inner edge of its limb - brightened northern arm .",
    "using wfpc2 images @xcite , flux - calibrated following @xcite and extinction - corrected following @xcite , we find @xmath59 , which represents about 25% of the total nebular surface brightness at the shell position .",
    "we also find @xmath60}{}/\\mathrm{h}\\alpha = 1.62 $ ] and no evidence of any [ @xmath8 emission from the shell ( @xmath61}/\\mathrm{h}\\alpha < 0.01 $ ] ) .",
    "for the shell temperature , we use the results of @xcite who find @xmath62 at the position of the shell from the ratio of the 4363   and 5007   [ @xmath4 lines ( upper - right panel of their fig .",
    "this temperature represents an average of the emission from the shell and the background nebula at that position , but there is no evidence for any significant jump in @xmath63 at the inner edge of the shell , so we can be confident in using it for the shell temperature , giving an effective recombination coefficient of @xmath64 .    combining all the above , we find a shell emission measure of @xmath65 and hence a density @xmath66 .",
    "the ionizing flux at the position of the shell is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the ionizing luminosity of @xmath0ori  c , assumed to be @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "the ionization parameter in the shell ( @xmath70 ) is very large when compared with typical values for the nebula as a whole ( 0.010.02 ) .",
    "therefore , if dust grains are not significantly underabundant , the grains will dominate the ultraviolet opacity of the shell . assuming a dust extinction cross - section of @xmath71 per h nucleon @xcite , the optical depth of grains in the shell to ionizing radiation is @xmath72 .",
    "for comparison , the neutral hydrogen optical depth is much smaller : @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the shell is optically thin to euv radiation , which , combined with the high ionization parameter , means that low - ionization lines such as [ @xmath8 are expected to be very weak .",
    "indeed , no detectable [ @xmath8 emission is observed from the shell .      in spite of its brightness",
    ", it has been difficult to determine the space motion of @xmath0ori  c , the dominant ionizing star .",
    "this is true for both the tangential and radial velocity components that are needed for deriving motion .",
    "the brightness relative to the other cluster members presents particular challenges in determining the tangential velocity .",
    "the most accurate study is that of @xcite , who determined that @xmath0ori  c  was moving at @xmath74 towards position angle 142  and that this was significantly larger than the dispersion value of @xmath75 found for the other cluster stars ( 49 cluster members in the sample ) .",
    "@xcite did not include the brightest members of the onc in their astrometric study , but did find a dispersion of @xmath76 for the brighter stars in their study .",
    "@xcite interpreted this high tangential velocity away from the direction of the imbedded bn - kl cluster stars as evidence that @xmath0ori  c  shares a point of origin with the radio source bn , which is moving the opposite direction at a high velocity ( @xmath77 at @xmath78 ) , and that the present tangential velocity would have placed the bn object in the vicinity of the trapezium about 4000  years ago .",
    "however , subsequent studies @xcite of the radio sources within the bn - kl region show that three radio sources in the center of the bn - kl region are moving away from a common center with a timescale of 500 years and that the bn - kl source i used for reference by @xcite was one of the moving objects .",
    "@xcite found that bn was moving towards the northwest at 24 @xmath41  in the orion cluster rest frame .",
    "the separation of @xmath0ori  c  and the dynamic center of bn - kl is 63 , which means that a backwards projection of @xmath0ori  c s tangential motion as determined by @xcite would cross that position in about 28,000 years .",
    "even if it is moving away from the bn - kl center , this timescale indicates that it is unlikely @xmath0ori  c  is a runaway object from the bn - kl region event that produced the three escaping radio sources and the bipolar outflow with an upper limit age of 1000 years @xcite that has produced the well known h@xmath79  fingers .",
    "even the modest anomalous tangential velocity of 4.8 @xmath41  may be too high .",
    "the data of @xcite indicate that @xmath0ori  c  and @xmath80ori  b are moving in opposite directions at about 3.5 mas per year . in a compilation of visual astrometric measurements of the relative positions of the trapezium stars , @xcite present results for these two stars over a time interval of 125 years , during which time the stars",
    "would have separated by 0.43 , but , there is no detectable change to an accuracy of about 0.15 .",
    "determination of the radial velocity of @xmath0ori  c  is also difficult @xcite . in this case",
    "the brightness of the star aids the collection of high velocity resolution spectra , but the star is complex , being an oblique - rotation magnetic star which shows a bewildering pattern of periodic and erratic spectral changes .",
    "it has a resolved early type star companion .",
    "properities of the system are summarized in @xcite . utilizing only spectroscopic radial velocity data , @xcite determined a systemic radial velocity of @xmath81 and by combining spectroscopic and astrometric @xcite data ,",
    "@xcite have determined the systemic radial velocity of @xmath0ori  c  as @xmath82 , which is quite different from that of the other trapezium stars and the lower mass onc members , as summarized in table 1 , and indicating that it is moving rapidly away from the omc and its host star cluster ( relative velocity about @xmath82 ) . the present structure and evolution of the orion nebula .    this special characteristic ( high spatial velocity ) may not be all that unexpected .",
    "@xcite concludes that in general 40% of all o stars are runaways , although only one in ten ob stars has a known binary companion .",
    "there is an observational selection effect operating in the onc that favors detection of blueshifted radial velocities .",
    "a redshifted runaway would be moving into the obscured portion of the omc and we would not be seeing the photoionized orion nebula .",
    "this means that if we are going to detect an anomalous radial velocity , it is going to be a blueshift .",
    "the difference in radial velocity with respect to the other trapezium stars would mean that either this juxtaposition of massive stars is coincidental or perhaps that dynamical interactions with the other has produced @xmath0ori  c s anomalous radial velocity .",
    "certainly , runaway stars are expected from a grouping like the trapezium @xcite and have been created previously in the onc . the divergence from orion of the two high velocities stars ae aur and",
    "@xmath83 col has been known for over a half century @xcite .",
    "calculations of the trajectories of these stars and @xmath84 ori @xcite indicate that they all originated about 2.5 million years ago from a position now occupied by the onc .",
    "this is not to argue that these stars arose in the trapezium grouping , however , it is evidence that there was an earlier epoch of massive star formation in this vicinity . given today s presence of three centers of star formation ( the onc , bn - kl , and orion - s ) , it is not hard to accept that there was at least one earlier similar center .",
    "likewise , the earlier creation of runaways argues that this could have again occurred and @xmath0ori  c  is the product .",
    "the presence of a high velocity stellar wind from @xmath0ori  c  is characteristic of early spectral type stars and will certainly affect the conditions of the nearby nebular gas . in this section",
    "we address the nature of the wind , its expected interactions , and compare the expectations with what is observed .",
    "radiatively driven stellar wind is modified by the star s strong dipolar magnetic field @xcite , leading to a very anisotropic outflow @xcite .",
    "however , the large inclination between the magnetic and rotation axes means that much of this anisotropy is smoothed out over the 15.422 day rotational period , so that it is reasonable to assume that the wind is approximately isotropic when considering its interaction with the orion nebula .",
    "angle - averaged values for the mass - loss rate and terminal velocity of @xmath85 and @xmath86 have been determined from modeling the x - ray emission from the base of the wind @xcite .    a totally independent measurement of the strength of the fast stellar wind is provided by the [ @xmath4/mir arcs seen in front of the closest proplyds to @xmath0ori  c @xcite , which are interpreted as the stationary stand - off bowshocks that result from the interaction of the proplyd photoevaporation flow with the stellar wind @xcite .",
    "the position of these bowshocks is determined by the balance between the ram pressures of the proplyd outflow and the fast wind from @xmath0ori  c , so that they can be used as probes of @xmath87 so long as the proplyd parameters can be determined with sufficient precision .",
    "application to the best - studied proplyd 167 - 317 @xcite yields a value of @xmath88 , which is consistent with the @xcite values given above .",
    "the interaction of the fast wind from @xmath0ori  c with its surroundings differs from the standard spherical hot - shocked wind bubble scenario ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to the effects of geometry , density gradients , mass - loading from embedded sources , and possibly thermal conduction .",
    "the different wind interaction regions are summarized in figure  4 , which synthesizes findings from many recent theoretical and observational studies .",
    "each region is discussed further below , starting from the inside .",
    "we concentrate on the inner parts of the nebular that are relevant to the observational material presented in this paper , leaving aside considerations of the eon from which x - ray evidence of stellar wind interaction has recently been reported @xcite .",
    "mass loading of a stellar wind by embedded sources lowers the stellar wind velocity of the unshocked wind and consequently reduces the temperature and modifies the cooling properties in the hot shocked wind region @xcite . in the orion nebula ,",
    "the sources of mass are the photoevaporated flows from the close - in proplyds ( pb in the figure ) and the stellar winds from the other trapezium stars ( sb ) . of these sources ,",
    "the proplyds are the most important @xcite , since the mass - loss rate from each proplyd is of the same order as @xmath89 @xcite , whereas the most massive of the other trapezium stars are early b - type , with winds at least an order of magnitude weaker than that of @xmath0ori  c ( ms in the figure ) .",
    "unfortunately , the efficiency of the mixing between the stellar wind and the proplyd photoevaporation flows is poorly constrained @xcite , leading to large uncertaities in the degree of deceleration of the wind . however , as long as the mixed wind remains highly supersonic , its momentum @xmath90 is conserved .",
    "when this mass - loaded , but still supersonic , wind interacts with the nebula , a two - shock flow pattern is formed : an outer shock that accelerates the nebular gas and an inner shock ( blue double - dashed line in figure 4 ) that decelerates the stellar wind .",
    "the two shocked regions are separated by a contact discontinuity ( blue dotted line ) , across which the pressure is continuous .",
    "if the inner wind shock is non - radiative ( as is usually the case ) , the shocked stellar wind ( sw ) will have a temperature @xmath91 and a thermal pressure roughly equal to the ram pressure at the inner shock .",
    "large - scale density gradients in the adjoining molecular cloud ( mc ) mean that the inner shock is much closer to the star in the cloud direction ( upper - left in figure 4 ) than in the opposing direction ( off - picture to lower - right ) , leading to a higher pressure of the shocked stellar wind in the cloud - facing direction , which therefore flows towards the low - density end of the bubble @xcite in a transonic wind exhaust ( we in figure 4 ) .",
    "a simple steady - state model then gives the radius of the wind shock as 0.73 times the radius of the contact discontinuity .      in the early evolution of an @xmath23 region ,",
    "the ionization front is likely to be trapped inside the dense shell swept up by the outer wind - driven shock @xcite .",
    "the density in the shell decreases with time , so that the ionization front eventally escapes from the shell and drives a low - velocity neutral shock ahead of itself into the molecular gas @xcite . after this time",
    ", the outer wind - driven shock will be interacting with photoionized nebular gas , as shown in figure  4 .",
    "if this gas is static , with a constant hydrogen number density @xmath92 , then the outer shock will degenerate into a sound wave after @xmath93 million years @xcite , leading to dissipation of the shocked nebular shell , after which one will have approximate static pressure equilibrium between the @xmath23 region and the shocked wind . in the cloud - facing direction , where the ionized density is @xmath94@xmath95",
    ", this will occur on a timescale much shorter than the age of the nebula , so that stagnant zones of ionized gas ( si in figure 4 ) can be confined by the wind @xcite .",
    "in the direction away from the cloud , the ionized density is much lower , @xmath96 , so that one may still have a dynamic shell ( ds ) of swept - up @xmath23 region that moves outward at a few tens of @xmath41 .",
    "additional structures will arise due to the internal dynamics of the ionized gas in the @xmath23 region .",
    "turbulence and gravitational collapse in molecular clouds @xcite produce density concentrations on multiple scales ( idealized as dense cores , dc , in figure 4 ) , which retard the progress of the ionization front . in regions where the ionization front is locally convex or flat",
    ", photoevaporation flows ( pf ) will develop @xcite , which reach mildly supersonic velocities of 2040  @xmath41 .",
    "where one of these photoevaporation flows interacts with the stellar wind bubble , a stationary shell ( ss ) of shocked ionized gas will form at a position where the ram pressure of the photoevaporation flow balances the thermal pressure of the shocked wind .",
    "[ [ observational - evidence - for - the - effects - of - the - wind - on - the - ionized - nebula ] ] observational evidence for the effects of the wind on the ionized nebula ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    as reported in   2.6.1 above , we have found an incomplete high - ionization shell in the inner orion nebula , which may be related to the action of the stellar wind from @xmath0ori  c. since the shell has both an inner and outer boundary ( figure 3 ) , it would correspond to a stationary shell in the context of the above discussion ( ss in figure 4 ) .",
    "this means that the kinematics of the shell is likely to be unremarkable , as compared with the kinematics of the general [ @xmath4 emission from the nebula .",
    "just as with the rest of the nebular gas , the gas in the shell will find it easier to move in the direction away from the molecular cloud and so should be slightly blue - shifted on average compared with the systemic velocity of the stars and molecular gas .",
    "inspection of the [ @xmath4 velocity cubes of @xcite shows that the line profiles from the shell are , indeed , very typical of the nebula as a whole .",
    "the inner boundary of the shell corresponds to the contact discontinuity with the shocked wind bubble , so the shell thermal pressure should equal that of the shocked wind . from the physical parameters derived from observations in   [ sec : phys - cond - oiii ] , one finds a shell pressure of @xmath97 .",
    "the bubble pressure will be equal to the wind ram pressure at the inner wind shock : @xmath98 , where we have assumed that the inner shock radius is @xmath99 ( see above ) and that the wind momentum loss rate @xmath90 is the proplyd - derived value discussed in   3.1 .",
    "given the uncertainties in their derivation , these pressures are indistinguishably the same , providing strong evidence that the [ @xmath4 shell has been compressed by the stellar wind .    the red bay @xcite is a region in which the high - ionization gas , as traced by [ @xmath5 and [ @xmath4 lines , has a velocity similar to that of the molecular cloud ( @xmath100@xmath101 ) , rather than the more blueshifted velocities ( @xmath102 ) found elsewhere in the nebula .",
    "the region of relatively redshifted velocities starts at the trapezium and extends in a broad strip ( @xmath103 ) to the east - southeast , which can be best appreciated as a light - colored region in the [ @xmath4 mean velocity map ( fig .",
    "13 of @xcite ) . ]",
    "observations , the red bay was broader , extending somewhat north of the trapezium . however , this interpretation is not supported by the better - quality [ @xmath4 data . ] the red bay is also associated with a region of lower - than - average [ @xmath4 surface brightness .",
    "comparison of the emission measure and electron density in this region @xcite shows that it is _ not _ a thin shell seen face - on , but has a thickness along the line of sight @xmath104 , which is roughly twice its extent in the plane of the sky .",
    "we therefore suggest that the red bay may correspond to a stagnant zone of ionized gas ( si in figure 4 ) , which is trapped between a concave ionization front , the stellar wind bubble , and the photoevaporation flows from molecular concentrations such as the bright bar .",
    "the several pieces of published and newly derived evidence require that we revise the accepted picture that orion - s is simply a local rise in the mif caused by dense underlying material in the omc .",
    "certainly , this is a region of enhanced density as determined from h@xmath105co@xmath10 observations .",
    "the recently published 21  resolution h@xmath105co@xmath10 maps the huygens region @xcite show the most massive cores to lie about 30  north of bn - kl and within orion - s , but these observations can not discriminate between cores that lie within a foreground optically thick feature and something that lies behind the mif and within the .",
    "however , the presence of h@xmath28co  absorption in the radio continuum ( discussed in   2.3 ) clearly places a high density , very optically thick object in front of an ionized volume and this the disparity in the extinction derived from radio to optical and optical line ratios ( discussed in   2.4 ) further confirms that the optical features we see lie in the foreground of an ionized volume .",
    "the low ionization seen on the northeast side of orion - s is most easily explained as an inclined face analogous to the escarpment causing the bright bar , but not as tilted .",
    "otherwise it is impossible to explain the [ @xmath8 surface brightness this close to the ionizing star .",
    "there are arguments that the foreground orion - s cloud hosts the embedded stars that are the sources of several optical features and outflows .",
    "a dark rectangular form lies almost exactly on the redshifted sio outflow and the infrared source 139 - 357 .",
    "it is not certain which ( or if both ) of these two features is associated , but an association of an optical feature with either places that feature in the foreground , rather than something within the omc .",
    "there is a suggestive notch in the h@xmath28co  absorption contour coincident with both the blueshifted outflows in sio and co , so that one or both of these must be in the foreground feature . the presence of high ionization , high tangential velocity features symmetric with the dark arc @xcite indicate that it is also part of the foreground structure .",
    "the h@xmath28co  absorption indicates very high optical depths in the near ultraviolet and it is unlikely that the obscuration by the foreground feature stops at the lowest contour of detection of h@xmath28co  absorption .",
    "this high extinction allows us to comment on the location of the sources that give rise to optical outflows .",
    "the sources of the large scale optical outflows have been isolated to a small region shown as the dark dashed - line ellipse in figure 1 @xcite .",
    "these outflows are all blueshifted .",
    "the east - oriented hh  529 shocks are high ionization and are seen very close to the source , indicating that this flow emerges quickly from behind the local ionization front .",
    "the west - oriented hh  269 shocks and also emerge close to their sources and are seen visually , arguing that they originate in the foreground orion - s cloud .",
    "the emergence further from the source region @xcite of the high velocity gas driving the northwest - oriented hh  202 and the southeast - oriented hh  203 and hh  204 could either indicate that their sources are more deeply imbedded in the orion - s cloud or lie within the background omc .",
    "the latter interpretation would that the lack of visibility near the source region is due to the high optical extinction of the orion - s cloud , but it seems more likely that .    there is a question about the location of the strongest infrared and radio sources in this region : 137 - 408 ( cs  3 in earlier , low resolution studies ) and 134 - 411 ( fir  4 in earlier , low resolution studies ) .",
    "the symmetry axis of the nearby hh  530 shocks points to either of these sources and the proximity of such an optical feature argues that its source lies in the foreground .",
    "the far - infrared emission from dust heated by embedded strong infrared sources @xcite indicates ( figure 1 ) a peak in the vicinity of bn - kl and a weaker elongated peak in the orion - s feature .",
    "the northerly extension of this southern feature coincides with the source region for the optical outflows and the southerly extension coincides with the 137 - 408 and 134 - 411 sources .",
    "unfortunately , this does nt tell us if the southerly extension belongs to the foreground feature or lies within the omc .",
    "the most likely geometry for this region is shown in figure  [ crosssection ] . in this model",
    "we have placed the orion - s cloud far enough into the foreground that the mif extends continuously behind it .",
    "the exact placement of the orion - s cloud in the foreground is uncertain , but it must be close to the distance of @xmath0ori  c  in front of the local mif because if it were much further from the observer it could not be distinguished from the mif .",
    "distinctly different heating processes are important in various regions of the orion environment .",
    "starlight is the most important heating / ionization process in the bright h@xmath10 region and its associated pdr .",
    "wind - driven shocks are responsible for much of the geometry and emission of the bn object . cosmic rays and",
    "heating by dissipative mhd waves may be important in deeper regions of omc1 .",
    "given the assortment of possible dynamical and microphysical processes involved , two approaches to numerical simulations of the ism can be taken .",
    "hydrodynamics codes follow the motions of the gas but must compromise the microphysics to solve the problem on today s computers .",
    "a microphysics code ( like cloudy , which we use here ) will not compromise on the microphysics but must do something simple for the structure of the cloud .",
    "atomic processes are usually much faster than dynamical timescales so the physics that determines the spectrum is often not affected by the dynamics and a static geometry can be assumed .    in this section ,",
    "we wish to understand several overall features of the orion - s cloud via .",
    "the primary question we want to answer is `` can we explain the presence of h@xmath28co in absorption ? '' .",
    "furthermore , can we do so in the context of other molecules seen in emission and the geometrical constraints imposed by the projected size of orion - s",
    "? there are estimates of the gas column density , particle density , temperature , and gas pressure ( which is surprisingly high ) .",
    "can starlight from the trapezium cluster account for these general properties , or are other processes at play ? here",
    "we test whether starlight from the trapezium cluster can account for several of the observed properties of orion - s .      the most important constraints to modeling the orion - s cloud are the h@xmath28co absorption measurements , the total column density , and the projected size of orion - s .",
    "in cold , dark , molecular clouds , chemical models which include the effects of accretion of molecules onto grain surfaces @xcite show that h@xmath28co will reside almost exclusively on the surface of grains ( henceforth `` freeze out '' ) at temperatures 10  k. a temperature of 10  k is also consistent with the ionized and molecular gas in orion - s being in gas pressure equilibrium ( see below ) .",
    "however , since h@xmath28co is observed in the gas phase in orion - s , the temperature must be higher , such that the rate of evaporation of h@xmath28co grain surfaces , @xmath106 , must be large enough      figure  [ fig : orion - s - h2co ] shows that this rate will be fast ( @xmath107 ) for @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , h@xmath28co observations imply that the dust temperature ( ) needs to be roughly 30  k or higher in order to explain the presence of h@xmath28co .",
    "the close proximity of orion - s to the trapezium means there must be an h@xmath10 region on the side of orion - s facing the trapezium .",
    "optical emission lines suggest that it has a density of @xmath109 , corresponding to a gas pressure of @xmath110 , assuming a gas temperature of 8500  k.      we perform calculations with version 8.0 of the spectral synthesis code cloudy , described by @xcite .",

    "the initial magnetic field was taken as @xmath113 ,    we assume a closed geometry , in which all radiation must eventually escape in the direction away from the central star cluster , if optically thick gas fully surrounds the cluster . under this assumption ,",

    "the first we demand our model reproduce that the model yield a temperature high enough to allow h@xmath28co to evaporate off of grain surfaces and remain in the gas phase . to inhibit freeze - out of h@xmath28co .",

    "therefore , we do not present co comparisons because of these complexities .    while our current analysis is sufficient to deduce h@xmath28co remains in the gas phase ,",
    "a full treatment of gas - grain and time - dependent chemical effects is necessary to fully understand the chemical environment of orion - s .",
    "such a treatment , while beyond the scope of this work and the current version of cloudy ( cloudy currently only treats freeze - out of co , oh , and h@xmath28o ) , will be the subject of a future investigation .",

    "2.7 we saw that @xmath0ori  c  appears to be moving away from the omc at about 13 @xmath41 .",
    "since this star is only about 0.2 pc in front of the local mif , @xmath0ori  c  would have been at the present location of the mif only 15,000 years ago .",
    "this is simply a reference number for the dynamic timescale as one would expect that @xmath0ori  c  would have continuously ionized the gas immediately surrounding it , thus producing a constantly changing structure .",
    "it does appear that @xmath0ori  c  has only recently entered a region of low density gas and has just begun to photo - ionize a much larger volume of space ( the huygens region and the eon ) .",
    "this is a dramatically new way of viewing the orion nebula and means that the object need not be in quasi dynamic equilibrium .",
    "a short illumination age of the onc stars is quite attractive because the well determined mass loss rates of the proplyds close to @xmath0ori  c  indicate that they should have been destroyed through photo - ablation within the last 1.5x10@xmath1211.1x10@xmath122 years @xcite .",
    "the absence of any evidence for destruction indicates that their illumination ages by @xmath0ori  c  are no more than a few times 1.5x10@xmath121 years .",
    "if one accepts the scenario that @xmath0ori  c has emerged from a much higher density environment during the last 10,000  years , then it is worth considering how this picture would change the expected ionization , density , and dynamics of the present - day nebula .",
    "if the surrounding density was much higher in the past , then the @xmath23 region would have been much smaller .",
    "for example , in an ambient density of @xmath123 , the strmgren radius would be only @xmath124 , or 3.2 .",
    "as @xmath0ori  c left the high - density environment , an r - type ionization front would propagate into the low - density gas at a speed of @xmath125 , this speed is much larger than the stellar velocity , so that deviations from static photoionization equilibrium would be fleeting and difficult to detect . assuming a density @xmath126 for the low - density gas",
    ", the ionization front would reach its equilibrium strmgren value ( @xmath127  pc ) in only 1000  years .",
    "the maximum recombination front velocity is also of order @xmath128 so that the gas would recombine effectively instantaneously in the high - density regions vacated by the star .",
    "the timescale for molecular hydrogen formation on dust grains is approximately @xmath129 @xcite , so that , unless the previously ionized gas was of rather low density , there has been time for it to return to a fully molecular state .    the density structure of the ionized gas",
    "is intimately tied to its dynamics , with typical internal velocities of order the ionized sound speed , which is very similar to the putative stellar velocity of @xmath130 .",
    "it seems likely , therefore , that the ionized density structure will not be greatly affected by the stellar motion .",
    "numerical simulations confirm @xcite that an approximately steady - state champagne flow is established on a timescale equal to the sound crossing time .",
    "it is therefore at the largest scales in the nebula ( @xmath131 ) that one would expect to find the clearest evidence for non - equilibrium dynamics induced by the stellar motion .",
    "however , uncertainties in the exact ambient density distribution and the effect of the stellar wind would make it difficult to draw clear conclusions .",
    "another possible observational diagnostic of a moving ionized star would be the dense neutral wake , which numerical simulations predict should form behind the star @xcite .",
    "again , observational detection of such a wake would be very challenging , chiefly due to confusion brought on by the rich profusion of structures at all scales in the molecular cloud behind the nebula .    a very young age for",
    "the present configuration of the orion nebula could also remove the dilemma presented by the fact that the h@xmath10 layer lying between @xmath0ori  c  and the veil is moving towards the veil with a closure velocity of about 18 @xmath41  and there is no evidence of an interaction with the veil .",
    "@xcite calculate that the collision time with the veil is about 40,000 years . without a detailed model of the expected",
    "very time - dependent structure , one can not assess the importance of this number except that it too indicates that the present configuration is quite young .    in conclusion",
    ", it seems impossible to definitively confirm or rule out the moving star hypothesis , based on existing observational evidence . the strongest argument in favor remains the short mass - loss lifetimes derived for the proplyds in the inner nebula .",
    "the strongest arguments against are : ( 1 )  the required coincidence that @xmath0ori  c currently resides so close to the center of the trapezium cluster , despite not being dynamically bound to the cluster , and ( 2 )  the difficulty in explaining how @xmath0ori  c acquired such a high velocity .",
    "the mass of the current @xmath0ori  c multiple system is @xmath132 @xcite , so assuming that it originally had a velocity typical of onc members , then to achieve its current velocity it must have ejected a @xmath133 companion at @xmath134 , or even faster for a less massive star .",
    "note that these high stellar velocities mean that many - body interactions at the level of the star cluster are unlikely to play a role since the velocity dispersion of the cluster is only a few @xmath41(jones &  walker 1988 ) and disruption of binaries by the cluster potential has been shown to be ineffective for binary separations @xmath135 ( reipurth et al .",
