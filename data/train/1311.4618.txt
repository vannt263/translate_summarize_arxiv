    "most of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , namely x - ray emitting binaries with roche - lobe filling low mass stars , are considered to involve neutron stars ( nss ) with low magnetic field strengths , @xmath12 @xmath1310@xmath14 g. they make a contrast to high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , mostly containing nss with high magnetic field strengths ( @xmath12 @xmath1510@xmath16 g ) which capture stellar winds from their companions .",
    "in fact , among @xmath1550 known lmxbs , only three are known to have nss with strong magnetic fields ; her x-1 , 4u 1626@xmath067 and gx 1 + 4 @xcite .",
    "these distinct combinations of the mass - donating and mass accreting components may be generally interpreted as population effects , that older nss have weaker fields .",
    "however , it is not necessarily clear whether nss gradually lose their magnetic fields ( e.g. , )",
    ". then , it is worth while searching for other lmxbs that involve nss with strong magnetic fields .",
    "evidently , the magnetic field affects accretion mechanisms in binaries .",
    "when the ns has strong magnetic fields , the accreting matter is funneled onto the two magnetic poles , leading to strong pulsations , and the production of very hard x - ray spectra which is often accompanied by cyclotron resonance scattering features ( crsfs ; @xcite ) .",
    "if , in contrast , the ns is weakly magnetized , an accretion disk is considered to extend down to vicinity of the ns , and the emergent x - ray spectra will exhibit characteristic bimodel behavior between so - called soft state and hard state ( e.g. @xcite ) . these spectral properties , together with the presence / absence of x - ray pulsations , will conversely allow us to tell whether the ns in a mass exchanging binary is strongly or weakly magnetized .    in an attempt of looking for lmxbs that involve strongly magnetized nss ,",
    "the present paper focuses on the dipping x - ray binary 4u 1822 - 37 , located at an estimated distance of 2.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "the companion star in 4u 1822@xmath037 is estimated to have a mass of 0.44 - 0.56 _ m@xmath17 _ @xcite , with @xmath18 being the solar mass , and hence this system is clarified as an lmxb .",
    "x - ray and optical light curves of this source both show intensity modulations and dips synchronize with its orbital period , @xmath19 @xmath15 5.7 hr .",
    "these effects are attributed to either gradual occultation ( by the companion star ) of a large x - ray scattering corona above the accretion disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or variable attenuation of direct x - rays from the ns by ionized humps on the disk ( e.g. , ) . from dip properties ,",
    "the orbital inclination is constrained between 76@xmath20 and 84@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "although 4u 1822@xmath037 is classified as an lmxb , its x - ray properties appear rather different from those of other dipping lmxbs .",
    "first , it shows clear x - ray pulsations with a period of @xmath21 = 0.5924 s which is much longer than those of other typical lmxbs , a few milliseconds @xcite if ever detected .",
    "figure [ corbet_diagram ] is so - called corbet diagram ( ) , which displays neutron - star binaries on a plane of orbital period and rotation period . like 4u 1626@xmath067 and her x-1 , 4u 1822@xmath22",
    "is thus located on this plot between typical lmxbs and hmxbs . combining the estimated x - ray luminosity ( 10@xmath23 erg s@xmath3 ) with @xmath21 and its change rate , @xmath24 = @xmath25 s s@xmath3 , the magnetic field strength of the ns in this source",
    "was actually estimated as @xmath26 g ( @xcite ) .",
    "although the error is very large , it is noteworthy that rather high field strength are allowed .",
    "second , this object exhibits much harder spectra together with a lower cutoff energy than typical lmxbs in the hard state . from the measured cutoff energy ( @xmath15 6 kev ) , obtained an estimate as @xmath12 @xmath15 10@xmath16 g. third , @xcite , using the _ chandra hetgs _ , detected from this source narrow iron k@xmath27 and k@xmath28 lines , which are generally absent or much weaker in other lmxbs @xcite . in the present study , we examine whether the ns in 4u 1822@xmath037 has _",
    "@xmath15 10@xmath16 g or not . for this purpose , it is necessary to obtain spectra with a good energy resolution and a wide energy coverage .",
    "the fifth japanese x - ray satellite suzaku @xcite , carrying onboard the xis @xcite and the hxd @xcite , is best suited for the requirements .",
    "we hence utilized an archival suzaku data set of 4u 1822@xmath037 , and study its spectral and pulsation properties .",
    "the mechanism of the periodic x - ray and optical dips , though interesting , is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "with suzaku , 4u 1822@xmath037 was observed for an exposure 37 ks on 2006 october 20 ( i d 401051010 ) . in this observation ,",
    "the target was placed at the xis nominal position . of the four xis cameras ,",
    "xis0 was operated in the 1/4 window mode , and the others in the full window mode .",
    "the hxd was operated in the normal mode .",
    "using heasoft ver 6.12 , we analyzed the data from xis0 , xis2 , xis3 and hxd - pin . in this study , we did not use xis1 which is the back - illuminated camera , because it has a higher background and is subject to larger calibration uncertainties than the other xis cameras .",
    "as the average counts rate of the xis , @xmath15 10 cts s@xmath3 , was high enough to cause pile up under the full window mode , the xis events were accumulated over an annular region with the inner and outer radii of 0@xmath29.5 and 2@xmath29.0 , respectively .",
    "this allowed us to reduce pile up effects to within 1% @xcite .",
    "the response and arf files of the xis were generated using xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen , respectively .",
    "the hxd - pin data were analyzed using a `` tuned '' non x - ray background file and the epoch2 response file , both officially released by the hxd team .",
    "we did not use the hxd - gso data because the source was undetectable therein .",
    "the present suzaku data were already analyzed by . combined with previous data",
    ", they determined the orbital period to be @xmath19 = 20054.2049 s = 5.57 hr , but did not report on pulse detection , or spectral analysis .",
    "figure [ lightcurve ] shows background - subtracted light curves of 4u 1822@xmath037 obtained with the xis ( 1 to 10 kev ) and hxd - pin ( 15 to 60 kev ) , together with the hxd - pin vs. xis hardness ratio .",
    "the gross exposure of this observation ( @xmath1590 ks ) covered about four orbital cycles , in which we detected about 4 dips in both the xis and hxd - pin bands .",
    "however , unlike the cases of many other dipping sources ( e.g. xb 1916@xmath0053 , xb 1323@xmath0619 and exo 0748@xmath0176 ) , no x - ray bursts were detected .",
    "the same light curves , folded at @xmath19=20054.2049 s , are shown in figure [ foldedlightcurve ] .",
    "they are consistent with those of previous studies ( e.g. , ) . from the bottom panel of figure [ foldedlightcurve ] ,",
    "the hardness ratio is observed to decrease during the dips .",
    "we also tried to detect the pulsation at a period @xmath150.59 s @xcite , using only the hxd - pin data because of the low time resolution of the xis . after applying barycentric corrections to the individual hxd - pin events",
    ", we further corrected the event arrive times for the expected orbital delay , @xmath30 , in 4u 1822@xmath037 .",

    "we fixed @xmath36 at 1.006 lt - s , after an accurate measurement by @xcite , and chose @xmath37 so that @xmath30 becomes maximum at the observed x - ray dips .",
    "after these corrections , we calculated a 15 - 40 kev periodogram .",
    "as shown in figure [ efsearch](a ) , the pulsation was detected with a high ( @xmath7 99% confidence ) significance at a period of @xmath21 = 0.5924337 @xmath8 0.000001 s. the pulse profile folded at @xmath21 is presented in figure [ efsearch](b ) .",

    "this value of @xmath39 reconfirms the previous measurements by @xcite .    37 with 128 s bins , obtained with xis0+xis3 ( top panel ; 1 - 10 kev ) and hxd - pin ( middle panel ; 15 - 60 kev ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the hxd - pin vs xis hardness ratio.,width=302,height=302 ]    37 as in figure[lightcurve ] , folded at the orbital period of 20054 s. the three panels correspond to those of figure [ lightcurve ] .,width=302,height=302 ]         of 4u 1822@xmath037 based on @xcite and the present work .",
    "the triangle indicates the present result.,width=302,height=302 ]      figure [ compsepctra](a ) shows 1 - 50 kev spectra of 4u 1822@xmath037 obtained with the xis and hxd - pin .",
    "the same spectra , normalized to a power - law model of photon index 2.0 , are compared in figure [ compsepctra](b ) with those of another dipping source exo 0748@xmath0676 and the x - ray pulsar her x-1 .",
    "the spectral shape of 4u 1822@xmath037 is similar to that of her x@xmath01 while different from that of exo 0748@xmath0676 , in the following two points .",
    "first , the spectrum of 4u 1822@xmath037 shows a very hard slope ( with a power - law photon index of @xmath431 ) below 10 kev and a steep cutoff at @xmath15 15 kev , in resemblance to the her x-1 spectrum , while that of exo 0748@xmath0676 exhibits a softer ( @xmath432 ) slope without clear high - energy cutoff .",
    "second , complex fe @xmath44-@xmath45 lines are seen at @xmath15 6.4 kev in the spectra of 4u 1822@xmath037 and her x-1 , while they are absent in the case of exo 0748@xmath0676 .",
    "these suggest that the ns in 4u 1822@xmath037 has strong magnetic fields , like that in her x@xmath01 @xcite .    to quantify the xis and hxd - pin spectra of 4u 1822@xmath037 , we fitted them jointly with an absorbed cutoff - power - law ( cutoffpl ) model , including three narrow gaussians to represent fe - k@xmath6 , fe xxv k@xmath6 , and fe xxvi k@xmath6 lines , at @xmath156.4 , @xmath156.7 and @xmath156.9 kev , respectively . the photon index @xmath46 , the cutoff energy @xmath47 , and normalization of cutoffpl were left free , as well as the column density of absorption",
    "similarly , the three gaussians were allowed to have free center energies , free normalizations , and free widths .",
    "the hxd vs. xis cross normalization was fixed at 1.16 @xcite . however , a large data excess below 3 kev made the fit unacceptable , with a reduced chi - square of @xmath483.0 for @xmath49=287 degrees of freedom . to account for this `` soft excess '' feature , we chose a blackbody ( bb ) , and fitted the data with wabs@xmath41(bb+cutoffpl+3gaussians ) .",
    "a bb with a temperature of @xmath15 0.1 kev improved the fit to @xmath50=1.21 ( @xmath49=284 ) .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ spectrafit](b ) , there still remained negative residuals at @xmath15 35 kev . since they are suggestive of a crsf , we employed a model of the form of wabs@xmath41(bb+cutoffpl+3gaussians)@xmath41cyclabs , where cyclabs represents the cyclotron resonance absorption factor given , e.g. , in @xcite . by allowing the resonance energy , width , and the depth of cyclabs to vary freely",
    ", the fit has been improved to @xmath51 for @xmath49=280 .",
    "as summarized in table 1 , the center energy of crsf was obtained as @xmath52=33@xmath82 kev . to make the model more physical , we once excluded the cyclabs factor , and tried a thermal comptonizetion ( comptt ; e.g. , @xcite ) and a  negative - positive power - law with exponential cutoff \" ( npex ; e.g. , @xcite ) continua instead of cutoffpl , while retaining the bb component and the three gaussians .",
    "as summarized in table 1 , the comptt continuum was less successful than that with cutoffpl , while the npex continuum was better .",
    "as shown in figure [ spectrafit](e ) , however , the bb+npex continuum again left the negative residuals at @xmath1535 kev like the case of cutoffpl .",
    "we hence revived the cyclabs factor , and fitted the data with wabs@xmath41(bb+npex+3gaussian)@xmath41cyclabs .",
    "the fit has become fully acceptable , @xmath50=1.13 with @xmath49=279 .",
    "the obtained cyclabs parameters , shown in table 1 , are not much different from those with the cutoffpl continuum case , except that the width has now been constrained as 5.0@xmath53 .",
    "while the error ranges in table 1 refer to 90% confidence limit , the cyclabs depth still remains positive , @xmath540.24 , if we employ more conservatively 99% limit ( i.e. , @xmath55=6.63 for a single parameter ) .",
    "since the inclusion of the cyclabs factor improved the fit by @xmath56=@xmath013.7 for @xmath57=@xmath03 , or @xmath56/@xmath57 = 4.56 , an f - test indicates that the fit improvement is significant at a confidence level of 99% . using the gabs model for the crsf instead of the cyclabs model gave nearly the same @xmath50 and a consistent value of @xmath52 from these results",
    ", we can claim the detection of a crsf .",
    "the 1 - 50 kev flux of this source becomes 1.5@xmath58 erg s@xmath3 @xmath2 , and the luminosity is @xmath59 = 1.0@xmath60 erg s@xmath3 at the distance of 2.5 kpc @xcite .",

    "in figure [ compsepctra](b ) , the spectra of 4u 1822@xmath037 were visually compared with those of her x-1 and exo 0748@xmath0676 . for doing this more quantitatively , we fitted the cutoffpl model to suzaku spectra of other hard - state lmxbs ( aql x@xmath01 , exo 0748@xmath0676 , xb 1323@xmath0619 , 4u 1636 + 536 and 4u 1608@xmath052 ) , and accreting pulsars which have strong magnetic fields ( 4u 1626@xmath067 , cen x-3 , smc x-1 , her x-1 , gro j1008@xmath057 , 1a 1118@xmath061 , 1a 0535 + 26 and lmc x-4 ) . figure [ gammacutoff ] summarized those fit results , on a plane of @xmath46 vs @xmath47 .",
    "the hard state lmxbs typically have softer ( @xmath431.7 ) slopes and higher cutoff energies ( @xmath61 50 kev ) , while the accreting pulsars show harder ( @xmath430.6 ) slopes together with lower cutoff energies ( @xmath6210 kev ) . clearly , 4u 1822@xmath037 is more similar to the accreting pulsars than to the hard - state lmxbs . in terms of the continuum slope , 4u 1822@xmath037",
    "is thus inferred to have common characteristics of accreting nss with @xmath63 g.      as argued in @xcite , the high - energy cutoff of the spectra of accreting pulsars , which are often steeper than a thermal rollover as pointed out by @xcite , is presumably caused by the presence of a crsf , which is empirically thought to appear at energies of @xmath64 .",
    "then the npex fit results , @xmath47=4.8 - 6.2 kev , predict a crsf to appear at @xmath52=16 - 23 kev .",
    "this argument was already employed by @xcite to suggest @xmath65 g.    indeed , as expected , we have detected a crsf at @xmath66 kev with a high significance . using the basic relation of @xmath12=@xmath67 g ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath68 is the gravitational redshift of the ns",
    ", we obtain @xmath12=(2.8@xmath80.2)@xmath10 g assuming @xmath68=0 for simplicity .",
    "this gives the most convincing evidence that the ns in 4u 1822@xmath037 is strongly magnetized .",
    "just to make the crsf detection more convincing , let us examine the derived crsf parameters . as already confirmed ,",
    "the resonance energy @xmath52 is consistent with the continuum shape .",
    "the depth , @xmath69 , is reasonable , in comparison with typical values of @xmath70=0.1 - 1.7 found in other objects .",
    "in addition , @xmath71=2 - 10 kev=(0.06 - 0.30)@xmath52 agrees , within errors , with the general scaling of @xmath71=(0.27 - 0.50)@xmath52 found by @xcite .",
    "thus , the present crsf interpretation of the @xmath1533 kev spectral feature is considered reasonable .",
    "the present hxd data yielded @xmath21 = 0.5924337 s and @xmath39 = -2.43@xmath72 s s@xmath3 .",
    "when these values , together with @xmath12=2.8@xmath10 g , are substituted into the accretion torque formula by @xcite , namely @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the luminosity in units of 10@xmath11 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath75 is the magnetic field in @xmath76 g , we obtain @xmath77 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "this luminosity is much higher than the value of @xmath151.0@xmath78 erg s@xmath3 derived from the observed flux and an assumed distance of 2.5 kpc @xcite .",
    "one possible cause of this discrepancy is that the object is in really located at @xmath79 kpc distance , instead of the 2.5 kpc which is based on some assumptions .",
    "an alternative possibility , already pointed out previously ( ) , is that the object appears unusually x - ray faint due , e.g. , to x - ray obscuration by some ionized materials on the accretion disk .",
    "indeed , its x - ray to optical luminosity ratio of @xmath1520 for @xmath801@xmath4110@xmath81 erg s@xmath3 ( @xcite ) is much lower than a typical value of @xmath15500 for lmxbs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio of 4u 1822@xmath037 will increase to @xmath15600 if we employ @xmath803@xmath4110@xmath11 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "another interesting discussion may be performed on the iron lines in the spectra . generally ,",
    "lmxbs have weak , sometimes broad @xcite iron lines with small equivalent width ( ews ) ; e.g. , @xmath82 ev @xcite .",
    "strongly magnetized nss , including her x@xmath01 and gx 1 + 4 , in contrast show narrow iron lines with significantly larger ews ( @xmath7 50 ev ; @xcite ) .",
    "these differences can be employed as an additional empirical argument to strengthen the high @xmath12 scenario of 4u 1822@xmath037 , although theoretical account of this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper . in this respect ,",
    "the narrow ( @xmath83=0.04 kev ) and strong ( ew@xmath15 50 ev ) fe k@xmath6 line , detected at 6.4 kev with the xis , clearly classifies this ns into the high - field category .    to be somewhat more quantitative , the width of the fe k@xmath6 line , 0.04@xmath80.02 kev",
    ", implies that the velocity @xmath84 of the gases which emit the iron line is @xmath15 0.6% of the light speed . assuming that the gas obeys keplar rotation , its distance becomes @xmath85 cm ( @xmath86 being the gravitational constant and @xmath87 the ns mass ) , which is comparable to the alfven radius ( @xmath88 cm ) for @xmath63 g while much larger than the ns radius ( @xmath89 cm ) .",
    "therefore , the matter creating the fluorescent fe - k line is likely to be stored on the alfven surface .    in the present data , we detected not only the nearly neutral fe k@xmath6 line , but also the other two lines which are identified as helium like ( fe xxv ) line and hydrogen like iron ( fe xxvi ) line as judged from their line energies .",
    "empirically , such ionized iron lines are observed from x - ray pulsars mainly when the source luminosity is high ; e.g. , @xmath901@xmath91 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "such examples include cen x-3 @xcite , her x-1 @xcite , lmc x-4 @xcite , and be pulsars in luminous outbursts @xcite .",
    "quantitatively this is reasonable , because ionization of circum - source materials is determined by so - called ionization parameter @xmath92=@xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the electron density of the line emitter while @xmath95 is its distance from the ns ( ionizing photon source ) . assuming that the two ionized lines in 4u 1822@xmath037 are emitted by the same material that is different from those emitting the 6.4 kev line , we estimate as @xmath96 , from @xcite and the comparable ews of the two ionized lines ( table1 ) . employing the same argument as for @xmath97",
    ", we may obtain @xmath98 cm from the line width of @xmath99 kev . adopting @xmath94=@xmath100 @xmath101 from ,",
    "the luminosity is 1@xmath91 erg s@xmath3 , in agreement with estimate using equation ( 2 ) .",
    "thus , the source is considered to be relatively luminous in x - rays .    during the net exposure of 37 ks ( @xmath102h )",
    ", no x - ray bursts were detected .",
    "similarly , there have been not previous reports of burst detection from this objects .",
    "while this could be due to rather infrequent burst occurrence at @xmath103 erg s@xmath3 ( ) , a more appropriate explanation would be to regard 4u 1822@xmath037 as an x - ray pulsar , which do not produce x - ray bursts .",
    "we hence conclude that 4u 1822@xmath037 is another example of lmxb that contains a strongly magnetized ( @xmath1043@xmath4110@xmath16 g ) ns . furthermore , its luminosity is likely to be @xmath153@xmath4110@xmath11 erg s@xmath3 , instead of the previously reported value of @xmath151@xmath4110@xmath81 erg s@xmath3 , although it is at present unclear whether this discrepancy is due to inaccurate distance estimate , on due to the edge - on source geometry which could reduce the x - ray flux reaching us .",
