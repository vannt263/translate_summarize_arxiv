    "the kerr space - time@xcite is , according to the uniqueness theorems @xcite , the only stationary , regular , asymptotically flat bh solution of vacuum general relativity . as such",
    ", it is believed to describe the endpoint of gravitational collapse when ( essentially ) all matter has either fallen to the bh or been scattered towards infinity . however , in order to provide alternative shadow templates for upcoming astronomical observations , it is timely to consider different types of solutions ( namely non - vacuum ) . in particular , templates are necessary for future observations of the supermassive bh candidate sgr a * at the center of our galaxy with the event horizon telescope @xcite .",
    "hence , a novel class of bhs in equilibrium with a massive scalar field , _ kerr bhs with scalar hair _ , will be considered .",
    "this class exhibits various intriguing properties , including shadows that differ significantly from the kerr prediction @xcite .",
    "shadow__@xcite is the region in the observer sky corresponding to the incidence directions of photons that originate asymptotically from the event horizon .",
    "it is the optical perception of a bh by an observer , contrasting over the background light .",
    "the shadow can be associated with the bh s light absorption cross - section at high frequencies , and its outline in the sky depends on the gravitational lensing of nearby radiation , thus bearing the fingerprint of the geometry around the bh @xcite .",
    "+ although in some cases ( e.g. kerr ) it is possible to have an analytical closed form for the shadow edge , in general this is not possible and numerical methods are required . for the latter case , the evolution of light rays is performed numerically by solving the null geodesics equation .",
    "the general form of the geodesic equations is given by @xcite : @xmath0 where the derivative is taken with respect to an affine parameter and @xmath1 are the christoffel symbols .",
    "this system of four second order differential equations can be simplified if symmetries of the space - time exist , with some of the four equations reduced to first order .",
    "+ numerically , the most naive approach would be to evolve the light rays directly from the source and detect which ones reach the observer .",
    "however this procedure is very inefficient since most rays would not reach it and thus spend unnecessary computation time .",
    "a better approach is to evolve the light rays from the observer backward in time and identify their origin @xcite , a method named _ backward ray - tracing_. the information carried by each ray would then be respectively assigned to a pixel in a final image , which embodies the optical perception of the observer . +",
    "this paper is divided in three main sections ; in the first section the backward ray - tracing setup is discussed ; the following section focuses on the kerr space - time and the last section addresses the case of kerr bhs with scalar hair . natural units @xmath2 will be used .",
    "in this section the space - time is assumed stationary and axially symmetric , and thus having two killing vector fields .",
    "additionally , it is also assumed to be asymptotically flat .",
    "the notation for the coordinate set @xmath3 was chosen in order to appear spherical - like .",
    "in particular , @xmath4 is the time coordinate and @xmath5 the azimuthal coordinate , each adapted to the corresponding killing vector . + the observer basis @xmath6 can be expanded in the coordinate basis @xmath7 .",
    "this decomposition is not unique , allowing for spatial rotations and lorentz boosts . a possible choice is given by :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 are real coefficients .",
    "this particular choice is connected to a reference frame with zero axial angular momentum in relation to spatial infinity , and hence it is sometimes called the zamo reference frame , standing for _ _ zero angular momentum observers__@xcite .",
    "an observer at rest in this frame moves with respect to the coordinate system , as a consequence of frame - dragging .",
    "the observer basis has a minkowski normalization :    @xmath10    we also require that @xmath11 . using these conditions we obtain : @xmath12 where the sign of the square roots was chosen positive so that at spatial infinity we have the standard orthogonal basis in spherical coordinates .",
    "similarly we get @xcite : @xmath13    a local measurement of a particle s property is performed by an observer at a given frame in the same position as the particle .",
    "thus , the locally measured energy @xmath14 of a photon is given by the projection of its 4-momentum @xmath15 onto @xmath16 @xcite : @xmath17 the minus sign is a consequence of the time - like normalization @xmath18 .",
    "the quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are conserved due to the associated killing vectors , and they turn out to be respectively the photon s energy and angular momentum relative to a static observer at spatial infinity , which leads to @xmath21 and to @xmath22 . ] @xcite .",
    "+ the locally measured linear momentum of the photon in all three spatial directions is obtained similarly , and so we obtain overall : @xmath23 @xmath24 a photon with zero angular momentum ( @xmath25 ) is observed in the zamo frame with no momentum component in the @xmath26 direction .",
    "this is due to the fact that an observer at rest at zamo also has zero angular momentum with respect to infinity , as was previously stated .",
    "consider the projection of photons detected in an image plane , corresponding to the optical perspective of an observer .",
    "the latter could be taken as a camera .",
    "the cartesian coordinates ( @xmath27 ) assigned to each photon in this image plane are its impact parameters @xcite and they are proportional to the respective observation angles @xmath28 ( see fig .",
    "[ graph_angles_alfa_beta ] ) .",
    "+ the solid angle that a given object occupies in the observer s sky is a well defined concept and it depends strongly on the distance between the the object and the observer .",
    "however , this `` distance '' can be a very subtle concept in a curved space - time .",
    "for instance , the proper distance to a kerr bh s event horizon can diverge ( in the extremal case ) @xcite . for this reason",
    "the perimetral radius was used instead . given a circumference at the equator ( @xmath29 ) with constant radial coordinate @xmath30",
    ", its perimeter @xmath31 is obtained by : @xmath32 since @xmath33 does not have a dependence on the coordinate @xmath5 the integration was trivial . the perimetral or circumferential radius @xmath34 is then defined as : @xmath35 this quantity is a possible choice to measure the distance to a bh .",
    "we expect the observation angles @xmath36 to have a @xmath37 dependence as we approach spatial infinity .",
    "hence , the impact parameters can be naturally defined as@xcite : @xmath38 where the perimetral radius @xmath34 is computed at the position of the observer .",
    "the minus sign in the @xmath39 definition comes from the sign convention for @xmath40 ( see fig . [ graph_angles_alfa_beta ] ) .",

    "in fact , @xmath57 only establishes the photon s frequency and does not influence the trajectory itself . for this reason",

    "this simplification is possible due to the existence of four constants of motion @xmath67 , where the rest mass @xmath68 for the photon and @xmath69 is the carter constant .",
    "the latter is a consequence of a hidden symmetry of kerr . + in kerr space - time there are unstable photon orbits with constant radial coordinate , dubbed `` spherical photon orbits '' .",

    "although two bhs with different values of @xmath96 are each still a member of the kerr family , they have distinct space - time geometries ; the coordinate @xmath30 is not even directly comparable between such solutions .",
