    "during solar flares , h@xmath0  ribbons form along the magnetic polarity inversion line ( pil ) and separate from each other in the direction perpendicular to the local pil @xcite . this well - known behavior has been regarded as a piece of evidence for the so - called standard solar flare model , in which the magnetic reconnection proceeds into the higher corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "motions of flare ribbons parallel to the pil are also commonly observed but had not received much attention until similar motions are found in hard x - ray ( hxr ) or euv / uv emissions @xcite . since the hxr emissions are due to high - energy particle precipitating into the chromosphere , the parallel motion could also be associated with the primary energy release from the corona , but its implication on solar eruptions and flare energy release is yet to be explored @xcite .",
    "recently , the motions of flare emissions parallel to the pil were related to the phenomenon called asymmetric filament eruption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during asymmetric eruptions ,",
    "only one end of the filament erupts upward with the other end anchored , which can lead to a sequential magnetic reconnection along the pil and may provide an important clue to understanding the parallel motion of hxr sources .    in this letter , we investigate the 2005 january 15 x2.6 flare , in which we found both the asymmetric eruption and the parallel hxr source motion .",
    "we will discuss the implications of the hxr footpoint motions on the eruption using a non - linear force - free field ( nlfff ) extrapolation from the active region .",
    "the @xmath1 active region noaa 10720 lies close to the disk center ( n15@xmath2 , w05@xmath2 ) when the 2005 january 15 x2.6 flare peaked at 23:02  ut in _ goes _  soft x - ray flux .",
    "we used high - resolution h@xmath0",
    "@xmath3  0.8    images with a pixel scale of @xmath40.6  and a temporal cadence of 12 minutes obtained with the big bear solar observatory ( bbso ) to monitor the evolution of the active - region filament and that of the early flare kernels .",
    "the images of the eruptive filament as well as the surrounding coronal structure were also taken at 195    ( with 5.26  resolution and @xmath412 minutes cadence ) by the euv imaging telescope  ( eit ; * ? ? ?",
    "the evolution of the flare hxr emission was entirely registered by _",
    "reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _",
    "( _ rhessi _ ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "clean images @xcite in the 40100  kev energy range were reconstructed using the front segments of detectors 39 ( giving an fwhm resolution of @xmath49.8 ) with 20  s integration time , starting from 22:32:04  ut , except the time interval of @xmath54  s at 22:34:08  ut when the _ rhessi _  attenuator switched between a1 and a3 status .",
    "considering the characteristic shape of the x - ray sources , we computed the centroid position of each hxr source by fitting a 2d elliptical gaussian above a minimum flux value , and we estimated the statistical position error by varying the threshold at 40%60% of the maximum flux . the footpoint velocity was then derived using three - point lagrangian interpolation implemented in the deriv procedure of idl , as it is less sensitive to the uncertainties in the position measurement .",
    "the total flux of each individual source was obtained by summing up the pixel values of the entire source feature , and its uncertainty was evaluated as @xmath6 of the maximum flux outside of the source within the field of view ( fov ) , as implemented in the standard _ rhessi _  software package .    in this multiwavelength study , we used the full - disk 96 minute magnetogram at 20:51  ut acquired by the michelson doppler imager  ( mdi ; @xcite ) for data alignment .",
    "the accuracy of feature matching is estimated to be about one mdi pixel size of @xmath42 .",
    "vector magnetograms of the whole active region were taken by the digital vector magnetograph system at bbso @xcite and were calibrated using mdi level 1.8.2 data .",
    "the vector magnetogram data have been processed following @xcite : ( 1 ) the central umbral fields were filled with those measured by mdi to alleviate the influence of polarization saturation ; ( 2 ) the 180@xmath2  azimuthal ambiguity in the transverse fields was resolved using the `` minimum energy '' method @xcite ; ( 3 ) the projection effects were removed by transforming the observed fields to heliographic coordinates ; and ( 4 ) the lorentz forces and torques were minimized by a preprocessing method @xcite .",
    "the nlfff model was then constructed within a box of 248  @xmath7  248  @xmath7  248 grid points with a size element of 1using the weighted optimization method @xcite adapted to bbso data @xcite , the results of which show similar magnetic structure during @xmath420:3021:30  ut . for the purpose of this study , we analyzed the preflare nlfff model at 20:51  ut , which was chosen for the optimal observing condition .",
    "based on the hxr lightcurve , we divide the whole event into five phases , i ",
    "v ( see fig .  [ fig_hxr]@xmath8 ) . we describe characteristic flare activities in each phase in the following subsections .",
    "time sequence of h@xmath0  blue - wing images in figure  [ fig_ha ] shows that the western part of the filament ( @xmath9 ) lying along the pil gradually rises upward from west to east during @xmath421:4122:00  ut and subsequently erupts , while its eastern part remains undisturbed as can be seen in the time - lapse movie .",
    "this filament eruption from the western edge of the active region produced a m1.0 flare starting at 22:01  ut .",
    "the m1.0 flare appears to be a confined flare , since its flare ribbons / kernels remain almost fixed till the occurrence of the subsequent x2.6 flare at 22:24  ut ( cf .",
    "images at 22:04 and 22:24  ut ) .",
    "the confined flaring also implies that @xmath9 undergoes a failed eruption @xcite .    in figure  [ fig_eit ]",
    ", we further examine the following eruption based on the evolution of overlying coronal loops shown in euv images .",
    "although @xmath9 erupts ( see images at 22:00  ut ) , most probably it does not immediately open the overlying arcade , which expands from 22:00 to 22:24  ut ( see the difference image at 22:24  ut ) and finally erupts at @xmath422:36  ut to become a fast halo cme ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "hence we believe that although the first eruption of @xmath9 ( @xmath421:4122:00  ut ) failed , the later eruption ( @xmath10:00  ut ) was successful to completely tear open the overlying field , resulting in a fast cme and the x2.6 flare .",
    "this process resembles the asymmetric filament eruption reported by @xcite .",
    "we show , in figure  [ fig_hxr ] , the evolution of the hxr footpoint sources throughout the x2.6 flare superposed on the h@xmath0  blue - wing images at the nearest time and the preflare mdi magnetogram .",
    "we further characterize the motion of hxr sources in figure  [ fig_light ] after a detailed quantitative analysis of the hxr sources .",
    "hxr images can be reconstructed only after @xmath422:32  ut . at the event onset during @xmath422:2522:33:34  ut , the flare kernels n1 and s1 show a consistent converging motion in h@xmath0  blue wing and hxrs ( figs .",
    "[ fig_hxr]@xmath11@xmath12 and [ fig_light]@xmath13 ) . meanwhile , the flare shear , defined as the angle between the line connecting flare kernels and that perpendicular to the pil @xcite , decreases steadily ( fig .",
    "[ fig_light]@xmath11 ) .",
    "similar behavior was observed before where flare kernels converge mainly in the direction perpendicular to the pil for the entire rising phase of hxr emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the converging motion in the present flare is mostly parallel to the pil , which is oriented mainly in the west - east direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig_hxr]@xmath11 ) .      during 22:33:3422:45:02  ut ,",
    "n1 and s1 keep a nearly constant separation and both move preferentially parallel to the pil ( figs .  [ fig_hxr]@xmath11@xmath13 and [ fig_light]@xmath12@xmath13 ) .",
    "the angle of flare shear is seen to fluctuate until @xmath422:38  ut but decreases overall at a higher rate than that of phase ii ( fig .",
    "[ fig_light]@xmath11 ) .",
    "interestingly , n1 first starts at a slower speed ( @xmath49.7  km  s@xmath14 ) and later the speed increases substantially ( @xmath456  km  s@xmath14 ) as approaching the main hxr peak p1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_light]@xmath12 ) .",
    "the maximum speed reaches @xmath15100  km  s@xmath14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_light]@xmath16 ) , which is comparable to other reported values of flare kernel motions found using high - cadence h@xmath0  blue - wing filtergrams @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig_light]@xmath16 and [ fig_light]@xmath9 , we plot the speed @xmath17 and the quantity @xmath18 of n1 in comparison with the hxr flux of n1 ( @xmath19 in fig .",
    "[ fig_light]@xmath8 ) .",
    "we focus on n1 , because it has the strongest hxr emission and exhibits the most intriguing pattern of motion .",
    "the quantity @xmath18 is regarded as a proxy of magnetic energy release rate under the standard 2d model ( first presented by @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we compute @xmath20 by averaging the four nearest pixels in the preflare mdi magnetogram around the position of n1 centroid , and we present two vector components of @xmath17 along the east - west and the south - north directions as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . remarkably , five peaks ( _ dotted lines _ in fig .",
    "[ fig_light ] ) of @xmath19 have corresponding peaks in @xmath23 , contributed by the footpoint motion parallel to the pil ( @xmath21 ) , while only one peak of @xmath19 at @xmath422:38:22  ut ( _ dashed line _ in fig .  [ fig_light ] ) is cotemporal with that of @xmath24 due to the motion perpendicular to the pil ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "this peak - to - peak correspondence is significant as it remains when a three - point smoothing is applied on the displacement profile prior to the derivation of the footpoint velocity . in phase iii ,",
    "the calculated pearson correlation coefficient @xmath25 indicates a strong correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath21 with @xmath26 and a weak correlation between @xmath19 and @xmath23 with @xmath27 , but only poor correlation is present between @xmath19 and @xmath22 or @xmath24 .",
    "similarly for s1 , the hxr flux better correlates with the parallel motion than the perpendicular motion .    as a comparison , @xcite also reported a motion of two hxr footpoints parallel to the pil . in their event ,",
    "the parallel motion was rather smooth and no correlation between the motion and the hxr flux was found .",
    "the authors proposed that the motion of hxr sources simply reflects a moving trigger propagating continuously along the pil .",
    "@xcite presented a generalized framework in which both the parallel and perpendicular motions represent the magnetic flux change in the corona as a way to explain the correlation between the flux of a coronal hxr source and parallel motions of h@xmath0  ribbons . in the present case",
    ", the parallel motion of hxr footpoint sources shows a good correlation with the hxr flux .",
    "this suggests that the parallel motion not only maps the propagation of the trigger but also represents the primary flare energy release .",
    "phase iv includes the peak p1 of hxr emission ( 22:45:0222:57:42  ut ) , during which n1 and s1 separate from each other ( figs .",
    "[ fig_hxr]@xmath11@xmath16 and [ fig_light]@xmath13 ) and n1 turns northward perpendicular to the pil ( fig .",
    "[ fig_light]@xmath12 ) .",
    "@xmath19 has a main contribution from the south - north motion ( @xmath22 ) and shows a moderate overall correlation with @xmath24 with @xmath28 , in agreement with the standard model .",
    "the flare shear first decreases rapidly during the hxr maximum before 22:50:40  ut then slows down ( fig .",
    "[ fig_light]@xmath11 ) , corresponding to higher and lower northward speed of n1 , respectively .",
    "however , s1 does not move systematically at this phase .",
    "similar type of motion was found in an event studied by @xcite in which one hxr footpoint source moves roughly along the pil and is generally correlated with hxr flux , while other two footpoints do not show any systematic motion .",
    "phase v has two minor hxr peaks p2 and p3 ( after 22:57:42  ut ) , with the conjugate footpoints , n2 and s2 , showing up in distinct , eastern section of the pil ( fig .  [ fig_hxr]@xmath29 ) .",
    "the motion of s2 is parallel to the pil , while that of n2 shows both parallel and perpendicular components .",
    "a general correlation exists between all these motions with hxr flux .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the flare shear actually increases @xmath430@xmath2  from p2 to p3 .",
    "this may be linked to harder hxr spectra of p3 than p2 found by @xcite for the same event .",
    "for the eruption mechanism , we consider the torus instability ( ti ) the most appropriate for this event , because there was a continuous flux emergence in the region @xcite and the supply of twisted magnetic flux into the corona tends to cause the ti ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "kink instability @xcite is excluded here because writhing motion of the filament is not apparent .",
    "other well - known models for solar eruptions , for instance , magnetic breakout model @xcite and tether - cutting reconnection model @xcite are not considered because there are no obvious chromospheric brightenings before the eruption , either in remote regions or within the initial flaring site at the western edge of the active region .    in the ti model ,",
    "the likelihood of eruption is gauged by the decay index , defined by @xmath30 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the strength of the external field confining the erupting core field , @xmath31 is the height above the photosphere , and @xmath322.0 is the theoretical instability condition @xcite .",
    "we calculate the decay index at 42105  mm using @xmath33 of the nlfff model (   [ tool ] ) as an approximation of the external field .",
    "filament activation usually occurs in the similar height range according to limb observations ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "we note that the nlfff model used here is constructed at a single time in the preflare stage .",
    "ideally we should have used time dependent nlfff models to examine the evolving magnetic fields . to obtain reliable extrapolation , however , we can not use flare - time magnetograms .",
    "we therefore only point out which field lines in the pre - eruption magnetic configuration are involved with the eruption in each phase .",
    "figure  [ fig_nlff]@xmath8 shows the magnetic field lines stemming from n1 and n2 at their locations in each phase , marked by different colors .",
    "we calculate @xmath34 at each position along the pil with index @xmath35 ( see fig .  [ fig_nlff]@xmath8 and also fig .",
    "[ fig_ha ] _ top _ ) and plot this spatial distribution of @xmath34 in figure  [ fig_nlff]@xmath11 . at each time of h@xmath0/hxr images , we also read off , from figure  [ fig_nlff]@xmath11 , the decay index at the particular @xmath35 where the line joining two conjugate flare footpoints intersects the pil ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_hxr]@xmath11 ) . in this way we are able to approximate the decay index for the coronal region undergoing magnetic reconnection as a function of time , as shown in figure  [ fig_nlff]@xmath12 .    in phase",
    "i , h@xmath0  and euv images show that the filament @xmath9 at the western edge of the active region failed to erupt , and that the associated m1.0 flare is a confined flare . at the location above @xmath9",
    ", the decay index @xmath34 has an average value of @xmath41.84 .",
    "since this value is relatively low , the failed eruption may be expected .",
    "although it failed , the m1.0 flare must have affected the local magnetic field in a way to reduce the overlying magnetic flux to some extent , so that the next cme eruption can occur along with a stronger x2.6 flare .",
    "the successful cme eruption is anticipated , as the main flare phases ii - v progresses from regions of @xmath34 about 2.5 to 3 with an average value of @xmath42.7 .    in phase ii , low - lying and highly - sheared field lines ( _ red _ in fig .",
    "[ fig_nlff]@xmath8 ) are involved in the reconnection process , during which the flare kernels n1 and s1 converge with decreasing flare shear .",
    "this is consistent with the previous view that converging motion of flare kernels is due to reconnection proceeding from more to less sheared field lines @xcite .    in phase iii , n1 and",
    "s1 move parallel to the pil from east to west , which corresponds to the motion from strongly sheared to less sheared fields ( _ green _ ) and also from stronger to weaker confinement of overlying field ( fig .",
    "[ fig_nlff]@xmath12 ) .",
    "the location and direction of this hxr source motion thus support the idea that the cme , which abruptly erupts outward at the same time @xcite , acts as the moving trigger to successively open the overlying field , in a way similar to the asymmetric filament eruption .    in phase iv ( _ blue _ ) , one footpoint n2 shows a standard perpendicular motion while its conjugate footpoint s2 does not . in phase v , n2 and s2 generally move in the opposite direction from west to east ( _ yellow _ ) .",
    "overall , phase v occurs in the region with much enhanced decay index compared to phases ii  iv . in all phases",
    ", the reconnection evolves in the direction of increasing decay index , namely , toward the region of the maximum @xmath36 3 .",
    "it thus appears that the magnetic reconnection tends to proceed toward the regions with weaker magnetic confinement .",
    "we have presented a near disk - center event that shows asymmetrical filament / cme eruptions and associated flare kernel motions observed at h@xmath0  and hxrs , and discussed the results with the aid of nlfff model .",
    "major results are as follows :      \\2 .",
    "the subsequent main event was initiated at the same region but proceeded to nearby regions of higher decay index , i.e. , weaker magnetic confinement .",
    "the eruption at this stage produced a cme and a stronger flare of x2.6 with complicated hxr footpoint motions , indicative of complex coronal magnetic structure .",
    "converging hxr footpoint motion was found in the initial stage of the x2.6 flare . as suggested before , it is considered as a result of reconnection proceeding from more to less sheared fields .",
    "in contrast to other events , the converging motion at the onset of this flare has a major component parallel to the pil ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the flaring scenario does not involve quadrupolar reconnection ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .    \\4 . during the rising phase of hxrs , footpoints moved parallel to the pil , a phenomenon similar to what was reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and by @xcite in a statistical analysis including this event .",
    "@xcite suggested that the parallel hxr motion occurs because the trigger of magnetic reconnection moves along the pil . in this case",
    ", we identified the moving trigger with the asymmetric eruption of the cme .",
    "it is further notable that the parallel hxr source motion has a peak - to - peak correlation with the hxr flux in complement to the standard 2d model .",
    "in summary , the observations and interpretations presented in this letter support the idea that an asymmetric eruption progressively opens the overlying field from one end of the pil to the other end , which results in a magnetic reconnection proceeding along the pil .",
    "a new intriguing property is that the asymmetric eruption and thus the corresponding trigger of magnetic reconnection tend to progress toward the region of weaker magnetic confinement .",
