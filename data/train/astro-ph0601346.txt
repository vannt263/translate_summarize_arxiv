    ", so an occupied halo may host a single luminous galaxy , a group of galaxies , or a cluster .",
    "higher overdensity concentrations around individual galaxies of a group or cluster constitute , in this terminology , halo substructure , or `` sub - halos '' . ] recent approaches to describing the relation between galaxies and dm focus on galaxy populations of dm halos as a function of halo mass .",

    "we based this choice on extensive tests with mock galaxy catalogs , which we constructed by populating halos in n - body simulations with galaxies .",
    "the result of our mock tests is that no combination of perpendicular and line - of - sight linking lengths can yield groups that successfully recover all aspects of the parent halo distribution , even for large richness systems .",
    "specifically , fof can not identify groups that simultaneously have unbiased abundances , projected sizes , and velocity dispersions .",
    "the ideal group - finding parameters for a given study depend on its scientific objectives . given our objective of using the multiplicity function to constrain the hod , it makes sense to sacrifice velocity dispersions and obtain groups with unbiased abundances and projected sizes .",
    "our choice of linking lengths results in a group catalog that , for groups of ten or more members , has an unbiased multiplicity function , an unbiased median relation between the multiplicities of groups and their parent halos , an unbiased projected size distribution as a function of multiplicity , and a velocity dispersion distribution that is @xmath2 too low for all multiplicities .",
    "we correct for fiber collisions and survey edge effects and present three sdss group catalogs ( for three different volume - limited samples ) and their measured multiplicity functions .",
    "it is important to recognize that our adopted group finder has the above properties only for halos defined using fof with a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation , since this is how halos were identified in our mock catalogs .",
    "a different halo definition ( such as fof with a different linking length , or spherical overdensity halos ) would require a different set of optimal group - finding parameters .",
    "this is not a problem as long as the same halo definition is used consistently .",
    "for example , an hod measured from these group catalogs will hold for this halo definition , and any theoretical model should use the same halo definition to compare its predictions to the measured hod .",
    "we chose this particular halo finder because it has been widely used and tested , and the properties of the resulting halo distribution ( e.g. , mass function ) are well understood .",
    "the groups and clusters that we present here are intended to be systems of galaxies that belong to the same virialized dark matter halo .",
    "we can test whether these systems are virialized by computing crossing times for the groups and checking if they are sufficiently less than the hubble time .",
    "we define the crossing time divided by the hubble time as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the one - dimensional group radius , which is equal to the projected ( two - dimensional ) radius , @xmath20 , divided by the square root of two .",
    "we correct for the velocity dispersion bias revealed in our mock tests by applying a 20% upward correction to all group velocity dispersions , and we compute @xmath21 for all groups .",
    "we find that , for all three group catalogs , the median value of @xmath21 is @xmath22 , and 80% of all groups have values less than @xmath23 .",
    "these numbers can be interpreted in terms of the spherical infall model @xcite , or other analytic or numerical models . however , at a first glance , the numbers are encouraging and suggest that most of our groups are likely virialized systems .",
    "the group and cluster catalogs presented here are well - suited for testing many of the predictions and assumptions made by galaxy formation models regarding the relationship between galaxies and their underlying dark matter halos .",

    "in this appendix , we describe the mock catalog tests that help us choose optimal fof parameters .",
    "since our primary goal for identifying groups is to measure the group multiplicity function and use it to constrain the hod , we clearly require our fof algorithm to produce groups that have an unbiased multiplicity function with respect to the true halo multiplicity function .",
    "in addition , we require an unbiased relation between the multiplicities of groups and their associated halos . finally , we would like our groups to have unbiased projected size and velocity dispersion distributions as a function of multiplicity .",
    "we create a grid of fof linking lengths and check how each set of linking lengths performs in the above tests , for each of the four hod model mock cubes ( ` .mr20 , .mr20b , .mr19 , .mr18 ` ) . in the case of each hod model , we average results over the 10 hod realizations described in   [ mocks ] and over the ` lanl1 ` and ` lanl4 ` n - body simulations .    before focusing on redshift space , we briefly examine how well fof recovers the true multiplicity function in real space , since this represents the best possible case ( any group finder will almost certainly perform worse in redshift space ) .",
    "we apply fof to the real - space cube mocks using a single linking length ( the linking volume around each mock galaxy is a sphere ) , and investigate how the recovered multiplicity function varies with the value of this linking length . in particular , we compare the mock group multiplicity functions to the input halo multiplicity functions that were used to construct the mock catalogs .",
    "figure  [ fig : nbodymultbxy ] shows this comparison for the ` .mr20 ` mocks .",
    "the bottom panel of the figure shows the logarithm of the ratio of group to halo multiplicity function , and the horizontal solid line therefore denotes the `` unbiased '' case .",
    "the figure reveals that , at large @xmath5 , the group multiplicity function has an unbiased shape that is independent of the choice of linking length ( at least for the range of linking lengths shown ) .",
    "the amplitude , however , is dependent on the linking length used , with larger linking lengths leading to a higher abundance of groups at large @xmath5 . a linking length of @xmath24 ( in units of the mean intergalaxy separation ) yields a group multiplicity function with an unbiased amplitude at large @xmath5 .",
    "this is not surprising given that the same value was used to identify dark matter halos in the n - body simulations while constructing mock catalogs .",
    "at low @xmath5 , the multiplicity function is highly biased , both in shape and amplitude . the abundance of groups relative to halos at a given multiplicity @xmath5 decreases when fof splits these halos into smaller groups or merges them to form larger groups .",
    "this decrease is countered by an increase due to the merging of smaller halos or the splitting of larger halos .",
    "the balance between these competing effects determines whether the multiplicity function is biased or not . for linking lengths near @xmath24 , merging dominates over splitting , which means that group abundances at a given multiplicity",
    "are mainly determined by a balance between halos at that @xmath5 merging to yield larger groups and smaller halos merging to replenish the lost groups .",
    "however , this balance breaks at @xmath25 because , while fof merges @xmath25 halos ( i.e. , isolated galaxies ) to form larger groups , there are no smaller halos that can merge to replenish @xmath25 groups .",
    "the abundance of @xmath25 groups is therefore necessarily less than that of @xmath25 halos ( it can only be more if the linking length is so small - approximately @xmath26 - that single galaxy groups splinter off in large numbers from larger halos ) . since most galaxies live in @xmath25 halos ( @xmath27 in these mock catalogs ) ,",
    "merging a small fraction of them to form larger groups will fractionally increase the abundance of larger @xmath28 , etc .",
    "groups significantly .",
    "this is seen in figure  [ fig : nbodymultbxy ] : the abundance of @xmath25 groups is lower than that of halos by @xmath29 for @xmath24 , causing the abundance of @xmath30 and @xmath11 groups to be @xmath31 higher . only for @xmath32",
    "does the group abundance settle down and become unbiased .",
    "this behavior is a fundamental limitation of the fof algorithm , and it has the consequence that group abundances can only be trusted for large multiplicity groups .    in redshift space ,",
    "group finding is much more challenging because finger - of - god distortions stretch groups along the line - of - sight , making it more likely that single halos will be split into multiple groups and that neighboring halos will be merged into the same groups .",
    "figure  [ fig : nbodyslice ] illustrates these effects by showing the performance of fof in a small slice through a single mock catalog ( one hod realization of the ` lanl4.mr20 ` mock catalog ) .",
    "the top - left panel shows the mock galaxies in real space , with each @xmath33 halo denoted by a unique color .",
    "the bottom - left panel shows the same galaxies in redshift space , where the line - of - sight is oriented along the @xmath34-axis of the mock cube .",
    "large open circles have radii equal to the halo virial radii and are centered at the halo centers in real space , and the galaxy centroids in redshift space .",
    "we run our adopted fof group - finder ( described in   [ groupfinder ] ) on the redshift - space mock and denote each resulting @xmath33 group with a unique color in the bottom - right panel .",
    "finally , we show the group galaxies real - space positions in the top - right panel .",
    "large dotted circles are centered at the group centroids and have virial radii that are estimated by assuming a halo mass function and a monotonic relation between group multiplicity and mass .",
    "a visual comparison of the real- and redshift - space panels reveals many of the failure modes of fof group - finding in redshift space .",
    "the halo denoted by green in the left - side panels is fairly well recovered by fof as the group denoted by green in the right - side panels . however , a couple of halo galaxies are missed in group finding , such as the one whose velocity moved it the furthest away from the center of the halo .",
    "most of the galaxies in the halo denoted by blue are linked together in the same group , also denoted by blue .",
    "however , many galaxies that do not belong to the `` blue '' halo are also linked to the same group .",
    "this is seen clearly in the top - right panel , where seven of the `` blue '' group galaxies real - space positions place them well outside the halo",
    ". a similar thing occurs to the halos and corresponding groups denoted by magenta and cyan .",
    "most of the galaxies in the large `` red '' halo are recovered correctly into the `` red '' group , but there are some galaxies added to this group that do not belong to the `` red '' halo , as well as a few galaxies that do belong to that halo , but have splintered off into a different group ( denoted by dark green ) . despite these imperfections ,",
    "there is clearly a substantial correspondence between the groups identified by fof and the true population of halos in this slice .",
    "we now examine the relative multiplicity functions of groups and halos when the groups are identified in redshift space .",
    "if we use the same linking length in transverse and line - of - sight directions , finger - of - god distortions will cause halos to be split into multiple small groups along the line - of - sight .",
    "this is demonstrated by the dashed curve in figure  [ fig : nbodymultbxybz ] , which shows the multiplicity function of groups identified with a single linking length of @xmath24 .",
    "the abundance of groups is vastly underestimated for @xmath35 , and the effect grows with @xmath5 because richer halos have higher velocity dispersions .",
    "we therefore need to use different linking lengths in the line - of - sight and perpendicular directions .",
    "we apply fof to our redshift - space cube mocks for a grid of perpendicular and line - of - sight linking lengths and find that we can recover an unbiased multiplicity function at large @xmath5 for the right combinations of linking lengths .",
    "figure  [ fig : nbodymultbxybz ] shows one such combination ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) and demonstrates how the group multiplicity function changes with the line - of - sight linking length @xmath38 .",
    "generally , larger linking lengths in either direction lead to a higher abundance of groups at large @xmath5 .",
    "we record all linking length combinations that yield unbiased multiplicity functions in the large @xmath5 regime and show the successful parameter space in figure  [ fig : linkinglengths.hod20 ] , as discussed in   [ groupfinder ] .",
    "recovering an unbiased multiplicity function does not guarantee that the one - to - one relation between the multiplicities of halos and their recovered groups is also unbiased .",
    "we therefore also investigate this relation .",
    "as described in ",
    "[ groupfinder ] , we associate each halo to the recovered group that contains the halo s central galaxy .",
    "groups that contain central galaxies from more than one halo are associated with the halo with which they share the largest number of galaxies .",
    "halos that end up not being associated with any group are considered `` undetected , '' and groups that are not associated with any halo ( i.e. , they contain no halo central galaxies ) are considered `` spurious '' .",
    "once we have associated mock groups one - to - one with their parent halos , we can look at the relation between the halo and group multiplicities ( i.e. , @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 ) .",
    "in addition , we can look at the fraction of halos that are detected and the fraction of groups that are spurious .",
    "figure  [ fig : nbodycompbxybz ] shows how these relations depend on the line - of - sight linking length .",
    "the bottom panel of the figure shows one set of linking lengths ( @xmath36 , @xmath41 ) that yields an unbiased median relation between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , but the scatter around this relation is large and quite asymmetric .",
    "90% of groups at a given @xmath40 are associated with halos that have up to 40% higher and 60% lower @xmath39 .",
    "increasing the line - of - sight linking length causes groups to grow and thus biases the median @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 relation by tilting it toward larger @xmath40 . as before , we record all linking length combinations that yield unbiased median relations between group and halo multiplicities , and we show the successful parameter space in figure  [ fig : linkinglengths.hod20 ] .    the top panel of figure  [ fig : nbodycompbxybz ] shows the completeness ( fraction of halos that are associated one - to - one with groups ) as a function of halo multiplicity @xmath39 , and the middle panel shows the spurious group fraction as a function of group multiplicity @xmath40 . over a wide range of fof linking lengths , the completeness for halos with @xmath35 is over 95% , and the spurious fraction for groups with @xmath35 is less than 5% .",
    "increasing the line - of - sight linking length causes a drop in the halo completeness and a corresponding drop in the spurious group fraction , since more halos get linked to the same groups . for",
    "the final linking lengths that we use ( see   [ groupfinder ] ) , the halo completeness is greater than 97% and the spurious group fraction less than 1% for @xmath42 .",
    "the high completeness and low spurious fraction are a result of how we associate groups to halos . since we only require a group to have a halo s central galaxy in order to be associated with it , most groups and halos have one - to - one associations .",
    "if we used a more stringent criterion for group - halo association , for example by requiring that a group contain some minimum fraction of a halo s galaxies , then the halo completeness would be lower and the spurious group fraction higher , but the scatter in @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 would be reduced .",
    "the three panels of figure  [ fig : nbodycompbxybz ] , put together , characterize the errors in the fof group finder . changing the definition for how groups are associated to halos does not change the errors in group - finding ; it merely redistributes the errors among the three panels .",
    "in addition to requiring that our groups have unbiased abundances and multiplicities , we would also like them to have unbiased size distributions .",
    "for every group in our redshift - space cube mocks , we measure the projected rms radius and the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of galaxies .",
    "we compare these to the projected rms radii and actual velocity dispersions of halo galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : nbodygrpstatsbxybz ] shows the median , 10th , and 90th percentile projected size and velocity dispersion as a function of multiplicity for halos , compared to that for groups identified with two different line - of - sight linking lengths .",
    "increasing the line - of - sight linking length produces groups with higher velocity dispersions , but it has less impact on the projected size distributions .",
    "the opposite is naturally true when we increase the perpendicular linking length .",
    "linking length combinations that yield groups with unbiased abundances and projected sizes tend to yield velocity dispersions that are biased low .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : nbodygrpstatsbxybz ] , which shows that the linking length combination @xmath36 , @xmath43 yields groups with velocity dispersions that are @xmath2 too low relative to halos .",
    "the line - of - sight linking length must be more than doubled to repair this bias , but then the abundances of groups would be too high .",
    "figure  [ fig : linkinglengths.hod20 ] shows the linking length parameter space that satisfies each of the above tests . as discussed in ",
    "[ groupfinder ] , there is no combination of perpendicular and line - of - sight linking lengths that yields groups with unbiased abundances , projected sizes , and velocity dispersions , even at high multiplicity .",
    "we choose to sacrifice velocity dispersions and adopt the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "all the above tests and resulting choice of linking lengths were done using the ` .mr20 ` mock catalogs .",
    "since we plan to use our group catalog to constrain the hod , it is vital that our choice of linking lengths does not depend sensitively on the input hod assumed when constructing the mocks .",
    "for this reason , we repeat all the above tests with the ` .mr20b ` mock catalogs , which use a different input hod to model the same @xmath10 sample of sdss galaxies . the results are shown in figure  [ fig : linkinglengths.hod20b ] .",
    "it is clear that our adopted group finder performs equally well in both sets of mock catalogs , demonstrating that our choice of linking lengths is insensitive to the underlying hod .",
    "it is also important to show how well our linking lengths work on lower luminosity galaxy samples , since we apply them to the sdss @xmath16 and @xmath17 samples .",
    "we thus repeat our mock tests with the ` .mr19 ` and ` .mr18 ` mock catalogs and show the results in figures  [ fig : linkinglengths.hod19 ] and  [ fig : linkinglengths.hod18 ] , respectively .",
    "the figures show that lower luminosity ( higher density ) samples require slightly higher line - of - sight linking lengths in order to retain unbiased multiplicity functions . however , this effect is small . when applied to",
    "the ` .mr18 ` mock catalogs , our adopted linking lengths yield a multiplicity function that is 10% too low in amplitude .",
    "overall , figures  [ fig : linkinglengths.hod20 ] , [ fig : linkinglengths.hod20b ] , [ fig : linkinglengths.hod19 ] , and  [ fig : linkinglengths.hod18 ] demonstrate that our choice of linking lengths is fairly robust ."
