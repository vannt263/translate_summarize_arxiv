    "the study of spaces with the daugavet property is a rapidly developing branch of banach space theory ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , and the most recent developments in  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the following classical spaces have the daugavet property : @xmath30 where k is a compact without isolated points  @xcite , @xmath31 and @xmath32 where @xmath33 has no atoms  @xcite , and many banach algebras  ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",

    "our approach is based on a necessary condition for a general banach space @xmath4 to be a daugavet domain and on a necessary condition for @xmath4 to be a daugavet range .",
    "we deduce these two conditions in section 2 ( see definition  [ deny ] , lemma  [ nodcfromdeny ] and definition  [ denyast ] , lemma  [ nodctodenyast ] ) and then we show in section 3 how they depend on @xmath9 when @xmath41 ( see lemma  [ corfdeny ] and lemma  [ corfdenyast ] ) .    in section 4",
    "we find a rather small class @xmath42 such that if @xmath6 is a daugavet range then @xmath43 , and in section 5 we discover the analogous class @xmath44 for the case of a daugavet domain .",
    "then for every @xmath45 we present an example of a daugavet center acting _ from _ a sum of two banach spaces by @xmath9 ( see proposition  [ dcfromexmp ] ) , and this solves the first part of our problem . in a very similar way we solve its second part",
