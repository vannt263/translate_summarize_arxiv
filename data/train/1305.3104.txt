    "it is often assumed that the deterministic term has a linear structure , _",

    "@xcite ) , known under the designations of gaussian process ( gp ) modelling and kriging analysis .",
    "it is conventional practice that all unknown parameters are estimated from the same data set , but clearly the classic kriging variance @xmath20 $ ] does not reflect the additional uncertainty resulting from the estimation of the covariance parameters ; for an early discussion of this issue , see @xcite . a first - order expansion of the kriging variance for @xmath21 around its true value is used in @xcite , see also @xcite for more precise developments , leading to an explicit additive correction term to the ( normalized ) kriging variance .",

    "in contrast to designs that simply minimize the kriging variance , ek - optimal designs are typically not space - filling , in particular for small numbers of observations .",
    "unfortunately , maximization of the ek - criterion is computationally demanding , since evaluation of ( [ ek2 ] ) requires the evaluation of the target function for all points in the candidate set , being unfeasible for high dimensional design spaces as it is often the case for computer experiments",
    ". it would thus be useful to have an alternative criterion that can substitute ( [ ek2 ] ) in the optimization procedure while still closely reflecting the actual prediction uncertainty .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : et ] we motivate our approach , exploiting the intimate link that should exist between the precision of predictions of the values of the field from a given dataset and the accuracy of the estimates of the process parameters based on the same observations .",

    "two pareto - optimal algorithms are proposed , both based on the idea of constraining the actual evaluation of mek to points in the pareto front of the surrogate criteria .",
    "finally , section [ s : mummexample ] considers the identification of pareto - optimal designs for a spatial oceanographic field produced by a biogeochemical mathematical model for the north sea , and section [ s : concl ] draws conclusions on the efficiency and limitations of the approach and suggests topics for future work .    before presenting the contributions of this paper , it is useful to consider the impact of the correction term in equation ( [ ek2 ] ) above , @xmath28\\}$ ] : its influence diminishes as the designs get denser , which happens , for a fixed @xmath13 , when the number @xmath18 of observations increases .",
    "designs that minimize @xmath29 $ ] are thus expected to resemble optimal designs for the ek - criterion when @xmath18 is sufficiently large .",
    "we illustrate this on an example by comparing the behaviors of greedy procedures for the sequential construction of designs that _ ( @xmath30 ) _ place the next design point at the current maximum of @xmath31 $ ] , or _ ( @xmath32 ) _ at the current maximizer of the corrected kriging variance @xmath31 + \\tr\\{v_\\nu\\,\\var[\\partial \\hat y(\\cdot ) / \\partial \\nu]\\}$ ] .",

    "all design points added by @xmath30 tend to fill the design space , whereas the first three points added by @xmath32 make a compromise between the precision of the prediction with @xmath7 supposed to be known and the precision of the estimation of @xmath7 .",

    "the problem is of practical importance whenever the cost of each observation is large , as it is the case , for instance , in geophysical applications , where it reflects both installation and maintenance of the sensing equipment .",
    "intuitively , accurate predictions of a spatial field in non - observed sites requires good knowledge of the process parameters , and thus designs that optimize prediction - oriented criteria should perform well under criteria that measure estimation accuracy .",
    "such relationships are commonly exploited in the field of design of experiments and run under the heading  equivalence theory \" .",
    "they go back to the celebrated paper by kiefer and wolfowitz @xcite who , by employing so - called design measures , and for parametric regression models with independent errors @xmath52 , established the equivalence of optimal designs for two criteria of optimality , one related to parameter estimation ( d - optimality ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath53 the other related to prediction ( g - optimality ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath54\\ , .\\ ] ]    the analogue to g - optimality for the correlated setup considered here is the ek - criterion ( [ ek2 ] ) which provides a closed - form characterization of prediction uncertainty . impacting distinct moments of the process statistical characterization , parameters @xmath1 and @xmath7 , related to the trend and covariance function , respectively , have a remarkably distinct impact on the prediction error .",

    "the reason for considering @xmath59 in the definition of @xmath71 , eq . ( [ cdalpha ] ) , instead of the entire matrix @xmath60 , is that @xmath19 is independent of @xmath5 , which only intervenes as a multiplicative factor in ( [ ek2 ] ) , which thus has no influence on the optimality of a given design for the ek criterion .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 is sometimes assumed to be known , and in that case @xmath68 coincides with @xmath73 .",
    "assumption of knowledge about @xmath5 may be motivated by estimability considerations : under the infill design framework typically not all components of @xmath74 are estimable and only some of them , or some suitable functions of them , are micro - ergodic @xcite ; a reparametrization can then be used , see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , with @xmath72 set to an arbitrary value .",

    "we have preferred @xmath59 over @xmath75 in the definition ( [ cdalpha ] ) as it more strongly sharpens the desired balance between space - filling and nonspace - filling behaviors , see , e.g.@xcite .",
    "some efforts have been made to uncover quasi - equivalence relations between optimal designs for prediction and for estimation , cf .",
    "@xcite or @xcite . however , it was shown in @xcite that a strict equivalence between ( [ ek2 ] ) and ( [ cdalpha ] ) does not hold , although optimal designs for one of the criteria tend to perform well under the other , as the example below shows .",

    "the blue star in the figure corresponds to the values of the two optimality criteria for @xmath79 .",

    "again , we note that the lh design @xmath79 is the worst design for both criteria ( they should be minimized ) .",
    "points in the bottom left corner correspond to designs that are nearly simultaneously optimal for both criteria , confirming the conjecture about the possibility of inferring ek - optimality from the two d - optimality criteria",
    ".    however , the correlation between @xmath84 and @xmath71 observed in the example above can be much weaker for other values of @xmath83 , and the determination , without evaluating @xmath82 , of an @xmath85 such that the maximization of @xmath86 yields a design close to optimality for @xmath82 is a difficult open problem .",
    "an expression with a structure analogous to criterion ( [ cdalpha ] ) can be obtained if we search for the design that minimizes the entropy of the posterior distribution of the predicted field .",

    "the algorithms differ in the manner they approximate this non - dominated solution set . the ek criterion ( [ ek2 ] ) will thus play the role of a preference function for choosing designs in the reduced candidate set @xmath91 .",

    "the minimization of @xmath82 over @xmath113 is therefore not equivalent to the minimization of @xmath82 over the set of pareto - optimal designs .",
    "however , if our belief that the two parametric estimation criteria @xmath77 and @xmath78 yield good surrogates for the ek criterion is valid , then ( _ i _ ) the variation of @xmath82 over each @xmath101 should be much smaller than its variation across distant points in the pareto surface ( this fact has been checked numerically on simple examples ) . @xmath99 and ( _ ii _ ) the minimum of @xmath82 over the pareto - optimal designs should approach the minimum of @xmath82 over @xmath113 .    the method proposed in this section is based on the identification of a finite set of pareto optimal designs @xmath115 , the final design being obtained by maximizing @xmath82 over this reduced set : @xmath116    since the pareto surface is the set of maxima of all scalar functions monotone in each criterion , we can construct a finite set of candidate designs @xmath115 by optimizing @xmath88 for a finite set of values of @xmath83 .",

    "the model results from the integration of 4 modules describing : ( i ) the dynamics of phytoplankton , ( ii ) zooplankton , ( iii ) bacteria and dissolved / particulate organic matter degradation and ( iv ) nutrient ( nitrate ( no3 ) , ammonium ( nh4 ) , phosphate ( po4 ) and dissolved silica ( dsi ) ) regeneration in the water column and the sediment .",
    "the field considered here is one of the maps of the distribution of nh4 , illustrated in figure [ fig : originals_98 ] , and our goal is to identify the 7-point design that would enable the best prediction of the nh4 field simulated by the model over the other points of the grid .",
    "this problem is representative of the design of networks of fixed oceanography stations with limited size .",
    "since our design criteria depend on the true process characteristics , we started by fitting a gp model to the model output . using maximum likelihood , we fitted the available data using a simple model with linear trend and matrn covariance function @xmath193\\enspace , \\ ] ] where @xmath194 is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order @xmath7 , obtaining @xmath195 @xmath196 , and range parameter @xmath197 .",

    "we can see that while the pareto - optimal design distributes the sampling points along the boundary of the region of analysis , the ek - optimal design contains several points in the interior of the design space , one at a considerable distance of the region boundary , and is able to keep the corrected kriging variance at lower levels @xmath203 versus @xmath204 ( a space - filling design only gives @xmath205 ) .",

    "in particular , both models fail to predict the high values of the field in the south - east small region , whose correlation structure strongly departs from the smoother variation in the open sea region , invalidating the predictions of the kriging variance . note that these errors are strong even for the ek optimal design , where a design point is located near that region .",
    "another factor that may be affecting performance of the predictors in this region is related to the fact that the region of analysis is not convex , and thus the use of a covariance model based on simple euclidean distance , like the matrn model , can not capture the internal structure of the water mass , which is confined by the region bathymetry .",
    "a detailed analysis of the dataset used in [ s : mummexample ] gave the following ml estimates for the covariance parameters : @xmath208 where @xmath209 and @xmath210 are anisotropy angle and ratio .",
    "ols estimation of the covariance parameters gave @xmath211 on this evidence we fixed the smoothness parameter at @xmath212 moreover the model fit was improved with this parameter setting .",
    "the trend then was estimated as @xmath213 @xmath214 , and range parameter @xmath215 and fixed @xmath212 gives    @xmath216 .",
    "the @xmath200 point pareto - optimal design @xmath201 for this model in the region of analysis has again been found by the method presented in section [ s : sa - pareto ] , where again 6 distinct points were identified on the convex hull of the pareto - surface .",
    "the parameters of the sa algorithm were set as in example 1 , that was started from a random initialization .",

    "we can see that while the pareto - optimal design distributes the sampling points along the boundary of the region of analysis and tends to have one multiple sampling point , the ek - optimal design contains several points in the interior of the design space , one at a considerable distance of the region boundary , and is able to keep the corrected kriging variance at lower levels @xmath218 versus @xmath219 ( a space - filling design ( minimax ) only gives @xmath220 and a coffeehouse design @xmath221 ) . in this example",
    "the ek - efficiency of the pareto - optimal design is 92% whereas the ek efficiencies of minimax- and coffeehouse - design are only 49% and 6% which is rather poor .",
    "figures [ fig : kpred_bestalpha52 ] and [ fig : resids_bestalpha52 ] compare the fields predicted using pareto optimal and ek optimal designs , and the prediction residuals , respectively .",
    "although the overall shape of the field is well reconstructed , being similar for both designs , inspection of the residual fields shows that the pareto design leads to stronger deviations .",
    "in particular , both models fail to predict the high values of the field in the south - east small region , whose correlation structure strongly departs from the smoother variation in the open sea region , invalidating the predictions of the kriging variance .",
    "note that these errors are strong even for the ek optimal design , where a design point is located near that region .",
    "this paper proposes methods for identification of designs quasi - optimal for the corrected kriging variance in the context of prediction of spatial gaussian fields .",
    "the criterion , also known as empirical kriging ( ek ) criterion , that takes into account the increased variance do to limited accuracy of the estimates of the covariance of the gaussian process , is especially important when this uncertainty is expected to make respective designs less space - filling .",
    "two methods are presented , both based on using the estimation criteria for the process parameters ( related to the trend and to the covariance of the random term ) , that are to be simultaneously optimised , as surrogate criteria for the ek - minimisation , they offer significant increased efficiency compared to direct optimisation of the corrected kriging variance , by limiting the evaluation of the numerically expensive ek - criterion to the pareto - front of the two criteria .",
    "they differ significantly on how the pareto - surface is determined .",
    "while one of the methods relies on the use of stochastic optimisation ( sa ) to sample the pareto - front by optimising distinct convex combinations of the two criteria , the second is deterministic , and iteratively approaches this surface .",
    "they have characteristics that are dual in some sense : while in the first the number of sampled points of the pareto surface is fixed by design ( by the number of convex combinations that are optimised ) , in the second the number of evaluations of the ek criterion is not fixed in advance .",
    "the price payed for this controlled complexity is a potentially poorer sampling of the pareto surface , leading eventually to a larger error of the chosen design .",
    "the paper illustrates the two methods both in a simple simulated model , and also to a real oceanography data set .",
    "the results obtained show the validity of the approach underlying the two algorithms , that are able to identify designs that are close to optimal efficiency , and prediction variances that may be significantly lower than it would be possible using standard space filling designs . of course",
    ", as we remark in the introductory sections of the paper , efforts to optimise the empirical kriging criterion should be limited to those situations where cost of observations is large and the impact of the estimation of the covariance parameters can not be neglected . in these cases ,",
    "the methods proposed here offer a cost - effective alternative to the prohibitive direct optimisation of the relevant ek - criterion .",
