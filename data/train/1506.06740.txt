    "one of the central questions about the origin of life is whether the delivery of exogenous water and organics to planets may have ultimately enabled it .",
    "carbonaceous meteorites certainly deliver a rich mixture of biomolecules to the earth today .",
    "these organic materials , including amino acids , could have formed in a variety of environments such as the interstellar medium , protostellar disks out of which planets and stars form , and within the planetesimals and asteroids that built the rocky planets .",
    "it is well known that these extraterrestrial sources could have contributed a very significant fraction of the organics present on the young earth s surface at the dawn of life @xcite .",
    "a direct connection that we have with the conditions that created such early amino acids comes from their measured abundances and relative abundance patterns within meteorites .",
    "a good example is the extensive chemical analysis that has been done of carbonaceous chondrite meteorites such as the famous murchison meteorite @xcite .",
    "the parent bodies of meteorites namely planetesimals which are typically up to 50 - 100 km in size , were formed during the creation of the solar system .",
    "their composition consists of rock and ice together with various simple molecules ( eg . hcn and ammonia ) and organics ( eg . formaldehyde ) that were inherited from the icy , dusty materials in disks and interstellar gas . such bodies also contained various radionuclides whose decay heated their interiors up to @xmath7c for several million years .",
    "given time and meteorite impacts , their organic content has been continually introduced to the planet @xcite . this abundance pattern may have provided important constraints on the nature of the genetic code that ultimately appeared @xcite .",
    "the formation of complex molecules is still not well understood .",
    "experimental work by @xcite has shown that carbonaceous chondrites like murchison ( a so - called cm2-type ) may be explained by a strecker - type synthesis wherein aldehyde molecules ( such as formaldehyde ) in the presence of water , ammonia and hcn give rise to amino acids ( such as glycine ) .",
    "@xcite shows that strecker synthesis retains the observed highly deuterated amino acids found in murchison , whose source ultimately is the d - enriched precursors in the interstellar medium .",
    "moreover , with few exceptions , it is found that the major amino acid that is produced in any reaction is the one expected from the associated aldehyde .",
    "not all classes of amino acids are necessarily formed in such reactions however , and there is some evidence that the so - called n-@xmath8 species may have been formed by catalytic processes associated with so - called fischer - tropsch - type ( ftt ) reactions @xcite .",
    "the observation of planetesimals and complex organic molecules in protostellar disks is now on the cusp of a revolution in our understanding with the advent of the alma observatory .",
    "as one example , it will enable observations of planetesimal systems formed in disks around other stars as well as the capability to detect carbon - bearing species in the later debris disks @xcite .",
    "alma has also been able to detect glycolaldehyde ( the precursor to the amino acid serine ) in abundances 1015 times less than methyl formate and 23 times more than ethylene glycol in the warm gas surrounding the protostellar binary iras 16293 - 2422 @xcite .",
    "such aldehydes would be incorporated into planetesimals and comets where they could play a crucial role in amino acid synthesis , as we will show .",
    "the overarching goal of this work is to thermodynamically model the synthesis of amino acids inside meteoritic parent bodies and to begin to link this to the astrochemistry of their natal disks .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter paper i ) took a closer look at overall amino acid abundances and the relative frequencies of amino acids within specific meteorite subclasses .",
    "this comprehensive view of amino acid abundance data provided us with the constraints that we now use in this computational study to reproduce these observed abundance patterns .",
    "early theoretical work on the synthesis of amino acids in hydrothermal environments was done by @xcite . using principles of thermodynamics and gibbs free energies",
    ", they showed mathematically that the synthesis of amino acids via a strecker synthesis - like pathway is energetically favorable in hydrothermal conditions .",
    "@xcite used thermodynamic considerations and gibbs free energies to produce a theoretical yield of amino acids in hydrothermal ecosystems .",
    "they found that the synthesis of 20 proteinogenic amino acids is energetically favorable in hot ( @xmath9c ) hydrothermal environments , as opposed to their synthesis at surface seawater conditions .",
    "@xcite shifted focus from hydrothermal systems to meteoritic parent bodies .",
    "using theoretical compositions of carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies , they calculated that various organic materials present in carbonaceous chondrites could have been synthesized during aqueous alteration of the parent body .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the theoretical synthesis of proteinogenic @xmath10-amino acids via strecker - type pathways inside meteoritic parent bodies .",
    "these bodies are important for amino synthesis since their interiors are heated to temperatures exceeding @xmath9c for more than 1 myr due to radioactive heating , as shown by full 3d hydrodynamics simulations of their interiors @xcite .",
    "moreover , the time scale for these reactions which synthesize amino acids is no longer than a few thousand years @xcite .",
    "therefore it is a good assumption that these processes will have achieved thermodynamic equilibrium , making the gibbs free energy minimization a desirable approach .",
    "our model inherently assumes this chemical equilibrium , and outputs a series of amino acid concentrations which minimize the gibbs free energy .",
    "we model parent body interiors using temperatures and pressures given in @xcite as well as cometary abundance data of organics for the initial concentrations in our model .",
    "we compare our modeled amino acid abundances to observed total abundances in different subclasses of carbonaceous chondrite , measured in parts - per - billion ( ppb ) .",
    "additionally , in paper i we calculated the average relative frequencies of various amino acids normalized to glycine , measured in moles of amino acid / moles of glycine .",
    "the amino acid abundances measured in hydrolyzed ( instead of unhydrolyzed ) hot water extracts were used for these calculations due to a larger quantity of available data .",
    "these average frequencies have since been refined and standard deviations have been added .",
    "we note that the variation in the measured relative amino acid frequencies is greater than any discrepancies introduced from using amino acid abundances in hydrolyzed meteorite extracts .",
    "we calculate the pattern of relative frequencies in theoretical yield , and match it to observation in two carbonaceous subclasses , cm2 and cr2 .    in this work ,",
    "we limit our investigation to proteinogenic @xmath10-amino acid abundances .",
    "this is primarily because the thermochemical database with which we work currently only contains data for the 20 proteinogenic amino acids encoded by the universal genetic code  with the exception of one non - proteinogenic @xmath10-amino acid .",
    "it is important to note that there are appreciable quantities of non - proteinogenic amino acids ( such as amino - isobutyric acid , isovaline and @xmath10-aminobutyric acid ) and non-@xmath10-amino acids ( such as @xmath11-alanine ) detected in carbonaceous chondrites . in appendix",
    "i , we analyze one case : @xmath10-aminobutyric acid .",
    "in addition , we currently only consider amino acids which are synthesized via strecker - type reactions involving aldehydes .",
    "amino acids such as amino - isobutyric acid and isovaline , while both highly abundant in carbonaceous chondrites , are synthesized via strecker - type reactions with ketone precursors .",
    "our results give very good agreement with the observed data base of amino acid frequencies . in trying to understand the absolute abundances of amino acids in the various meteorite classes predicted in our models , we propose that the variations in the water and ammonia content of planetesimals formed at varying radii within natal protoplanetary disks would naturally account for these differences .",
    "this is a new picture that is quite different than the current `` onion '' structure of differentiated chemistry within a planetesimal .",
    "the layout of this paper is to first quickly review our observational results from paper i , summarize the theoretical and computational methods that we used , and then to discuss our results and comparison to the data for both the abundances and relative frequencies of our models .",
    "finally , we discuss the results in a larger framework and introduce our new picture in the last section of the paper .",
    "paper i presented an extensive collation of available meteoritic data on amino acid abundances and relative frequencies in carbonaceous chondrites .",
    "carbonaceous chondrites are the class of meteorite that contain the highest content of both water and organic materials , including amino acids .",
    "these abundances are seen to vary systematically with meteoritic type . in this section",
    "we give a quick summary of meteorite classification , followed by a summary of their amino acid abundances ( the reader is encouraged to read paper i for the details ) .",
    "meteorites are assigned a number 16 indicating petrologic type , in addition to a subclass designation ci , cm , cr , cv , co , ch , cb , and ck .",
    "petrologic type carries with it information regarding degrees of internal chemical alteration undergone by a meteoritic parent body .",
    "petrologic type 1 chondrites are the most aqueously altered .",
    "this means the liquid water within the parent bodies has chemically altered their makeup .",
    "petrologic type 2 meteorites have undergone significant degrees of aqueous alteration , though not to the extent of type 1 meteorites .",
    "petrologic type 3 meteorites most closely resemble the solar nebulae in which they formed ; they have undergone relatively little to no degrees of alteration .",
    "all carbonaceous chondrites subclasses from petrologic types 13 are known to contain high concentrations of water and organics .",
    "petrologic types 46 indicate increasing degrees of thermal metamorphism .",
    "we restrict our modeling to meteorites of type 13 , as samples in this regime have been aqueously altered and produced amino acids via strecker synthesis .",
    "ci meteorites , all petrologic type 1 , are among the most aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites .",
    "they are generally associated with a higher range in temperatures , @xmath12c to @xmath13c , according to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and they rank approximately fourth highest for average total amino acid abundances by carbonaceous chondrite subclass .",
    "the cm and cr subclasses express the highest total amino acid concentrations , greater by several orders of magnitude than any other subclass .",
    "they also express the greatest variety of proteinogenic amino acids .",
    "these subclasses generally correspond to petrologic type 2 , with several exceptions , and are associated with alteration temperatures in the broad range of @xmath14c to @xmath15c .",
    "cm - types are given a range of @xmath14c to roughly @xmath12c in some studies @xcite , but one study assigns a much higher peak metamorphic temperature of @xmath15c @xcite .",
    "peak metamorphic temperatures of chondrites are typically estimated from phase changes or reactions that occur at specific temperatures @xcite .",
    "@xcite on the other hand use the correlation between the d band width ( obtained from raman spectroscopy ) and peak metamorphic temperature to base their estimates .",
    "cr meteorites , spanning petrologic types 13 , also have a discrepancy in classification temperatures . @xcite",
    "give a peak metamorphic temperature of @xmath15c , @xcite cite an upper temperature bound of 150300@xmath1c , and @xcite state a range of @xmath16c to @xmath7c .",
    "@xcite provide a broader range in classification temperatures , @xmath17c and @xmath18c , associated with `` all stages of aqueous alteration . ''",
    "cv , co , ch and cb meteorites are all petrologic type 3 .",
    "these meteorites are associated with peak metamorphic temperatures ranging from 200600@xmath1c @xcite , though @xcite has cv3 peak temperatures at a much lower 50@xmath1c .",
    "these chondrites are thought to be the most pristine samples of material we have from the time of the solar system formation .",
    "they are relatively unaltered , either via aqueous alteration or thermal metamorphism  which occurs at higher temperatures of perhaps @xmath19c @xcite with no water present . with the exception of ch meteorites which are the third most abundant subclass in total amino acids , we observe low levels of amino acids in these meteorites .",
    "lastly , the ck meteorites span petrologic types 36 and are associated with temperatures from 250600@xmath1c @xcite . a recent study has found one ck3 meteorite to be comparable in amino acid abundances to the ci1 types @xcite .",
    "the ck46 meteorites in the same study were found to have very low abundances of amino acids .      in figure 8 of paper",
    "i , we plot average amino acid abundances in parts - per - billion ( ppb ) across different carbonaceous chondrite subclasses .",
    "the histogram style abundance plot shows average amino acid abundance for various proteinogenic amino acids for each of the six subclasses of carbonaceous chondrite we consider .",
    "this allows us to identify graphically in which subclasses there is a greater concentration of amino acids .",
    "the co3 and cm1/cr1 sections have average abundances on the order of @xmath20 ppb .",
    "the average abundance of each amino acid for cv3 and ci1 subclasses is on the order of @xmath21 ppb .",
    "cm2-types contain @xmath22 ppb per amino acid on average .",
    "the cr2-types show the greatest variation in abundance , each average ranging from @xmath22@xmath2 ppb .",
    "the ch3 , cb3 and ck3 types were not included in figure 8 of paper i , but have since been found to contain @xmath21@xmath22 ppb , @xmath20@xmath21 ppb and @xmath21 ppb per amino acid on average , respectively @xcite . from these two studies and",
    "figure 8 of paper i , we identified the petrologic type 2 meteorites , both cm2 and cr2 , as containing greater total abundances of amino acids than either the petrologic type 1 or type 3 meteorites .",
    "this is in agreement with observations and conclusions by , for example , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "in addition to modeling the total amino acid yield , we investigate the relative frequencies of amino acids .",
    "figures 9 and 10 in paper i show the relative frequencies of 13 amino acids relative to glycine in the cm2 and cr2 subclasses , respectively . as the cm2 and",
    "cr2 subclasses contain the greatest concentrations and variety of amino acids , we selected these groups as a starting place for thermodynamic modeling",
    ". we normalize to glycine as this amino acid is classically one of the most abundant found in meteorites , it is the easiest to synthesize and is most energetically favorable , and it is achiral . in both subclasses , alanine is the second most abundant amino acid and glutamic acid is the third . among the cm2 chondrites , there are also significant quantities of serine , proline , lysine , threonine , valine , isoleucine , leucine , aspartic acid , tyrosine , and phenylalanine .",
    "the cr2 samples show great variety in frequency ; valine , isoleucine , leucine , proline , and phenylalanine are fairly prevalent , and there are small quantities of aspartic acid , threonine , serine , and tyrosine .",
    "we use the same theoretical model used for calculating total amino acid yield to measure relative frequencies .",
    "the general form of a strecker - type reaction is shown by the mass - balance equation in figure  [ strecker ] . following the experimental work discussed in the introduction @xcite , we simplify our equilibrium chemistry scheme to focus on the relation between an aldehyde and its main amino acid .",
    "a strecker - type reaction is defined as the reaction between an aldehyde ( r - cho ) , hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ) and ammonia ( nh@xmath6 ) in aqueous solution ( h@xmath23o ) which produces an amino acid ( h@xmath23n - rch - cooh ) and an ammonia molecule .",
    "there is an intermediate step not depicted in figure  [ strecker ] ; in the strecker synthesis of glycine , for example , reactants initially combine to create an aminoacetonitrile ( nh@xmath23ch@xmath23cn ) , which then undergoes a one - way process called hydrolysis , resulting in the creation of glycine ( c@xmath23h@xmath24no@xmath23 ) .",
    "this general form may be used to define the underlying strecker pathway for each of the proteinogenic amino acids laid out in paper i. in each case , the side chain ( r group ) of a reactant aldehyde will be identical to the r group in the corresponding amino acid .",

    "it is important to note that chemapp has no inherent method for differentiating between molecular structures .",
    "because each input species is broken down to its elemental form , two chemapp trials run with different molecular abundances , but identical elemental abundances , would return equivalent output concentrations .",
    "additionally , our current treatment assumes an ideal solution for each reaction , and we only allow the chemistry to be in a single phase  aqueous or gaseous  at any given temperature and pressure .",

    "this means , for example , we do not include the formation pathways which lead to the formation of aldehydes in chemapp ; we assume some initial aldehyde concentration .",
    "also , although we do not explicitly consider the hydroxy acids which strecker synthesis may also produce in these calculations , we do address their effects later in the paper ( see section  [ chemcomp ] ) . in this way , we have a limited set of initial species and a limited set of possible products .",

    "factors which may then be varied between chemapp runs are temperature and the initial concentrations of reactants .",

    "since the liquid - to - gas phase change turns off amino acid synthesis  as made clear by the abrupt vertical drop - off of each curve in figure [ pressureprofile ] at their respective boiling points of water  the suggested limit of aqueous alteration by @xcite may be a product of pressures not exceeding 100 bar within most meteorite parent bodies .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite suggests that petrologic type 2 meteorites can synthesize amino acids up to @xmath44c . in order for our simulation to yield non - zero abundances of amino acids at this temperature , the initial pressure condition necessary would need to surpass the estimated pressure near the core of 10 hygiea ( the 4th largest asteroid in the solar system ) of 246 bar ; as calculated by @xcite .      a possible reason why our cm2-type thermodynamic model returned abundances an approximate order of magnitude greater than observed amino acid abundances in cm2 meteorites , is that different subclasses of meteorite could originate from different parent bodies , some of which tend to have less water .",

    "the concentrations producing the lowest chi - squared value ( to four decimal places ) , used in the model producing figure  [ cmfreq ] , are shown in the cm column of table  [ cmrconcs ] .",
    "the effects of this optimization are apparent in the excellent agreement between observed frequencies and the model frequencies at @xmath7c .",

    "isoleucine ( ile ) is the only other amino acid to have a noticeable frequency degradation .",
    "all other amino acids retain modeled abundances akin to their observed frequencies throughout the temperature progression .",
    "this can be partially explained by thermodynamic favourability , as lys and ile have the highest gibbs energies of formation of the 10 amino acids through temperature increase , and are therefore the least favourable ( see appendix i figure  [ appendixfigure1 ] ) .",

    "the amino acid lysine , shown in figure  [ cmfreq ] , is not shown for the cr2 equivalent , as there are no data among cr meteorites for lysine concentrations .",
    "as for the cm2 subclass , we perform a chi - squared minimization on aldehyde abundances for the cr2 subclass .",
    "this is done by varying the initial aldehyde concentrations and measuring the chi - squared between the relative amino acid frequencies from simulation and the average relative amino acid frequencies in cr2 meteorites .",
    "the aldehyde abundances  in percent normalized to water  which minimize the chi - squared are shown in the cr column of table  [ cmrconcs ] .",
    "these optimized aldehyde abundances produce model relative frequencies in good agreement with observed relative frequencies at @xmath7c ( see figure  [ crfreq ] ) .",
    "all model frequencies stand well within their observed frequency error bars .",
    "the pattern then changes rapidly with increasing temperature .",
    "some relative abundances ( glu , val , leu and ser ) increase between @xmath7c and @xmath45c , while others ( ala , ile and thr ) decrease . ile and thr have the largest decrease in relative abundance from @xmath7c to @xmath45c .",
    "thr then stabilizes whereas ile decays to 10@xmath43 by @xmath47c ; and to only trace amounts by @xmath18c .",
    "asp , and arguably ala , are the only amino acids to retain abundances similar to their observed frequencies throughout the shown temperature range .",
    "as these figures show frequencies relative to some baseline ( in this case , glycine ) , it is entirely reasonable for future calculations to scale overall abundances of aldehydes .",
    "we assume some base concentration of formaldehyde , as this is the precursor for glycine , to which we normalize additional amino acids .",
    "it is the abundances of the aldehydes relative to formaldehyde that are responsible for the agreement between observed and modeled amino acid frequencies .    in the case of figure  [ crfreq ] ,",
    "the abundance of acetaldehyde is higher than its abundance in the cm2 model by approximately a factor of 2 .",
    "this makes sense visually .",
    "acetaldehyde is the aldehyde involved in the modeled synthesis of ala ; and the cr frequency of ala is approximately twice as much as its cm counterpart .",
    "the aldehyde concentrations listed in table  [ cmrconcs ] minimize @xmath48 over variations in both concentration and temperature . while this helps to constrain formation conditions of amino acids in planetesimals , we are left with no impression of which thermodynamic consideration has a larger impact on organic synthesis .",
    "there are three aspects in our thermodynamic model that may be manipulated : pressure , temperature , and composition .",
    "we set pressure to a typical value for the interior of parent bodies and hold it constant . the effect of pressure on gibbs free energy before the liquid - to - gas phase transition is minimal in comparison to the effects of changing temperature , as discussed above .    with regard to which aspect , temperature or composition ( which we treat , for now , as a simplified model of aldehyde abundances ) , has a more significant effect on relative frequencies , we consider the evolution of @xmath48 values .",

    "as discussed in paper i , the onion shell model for planetesimals proposes that the carbonaceous chondrites within a certain subclass may share the same meteorite parent body @xcite , and that the different petrologic types within each subclass originate from different layers within the parent body ; with each layer corresponding to a different temperature @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ comparison ] , the change in theoretical total amino acid abundances over the aqueous phase temperature range is too minute to support a simple temperature - differentiated onion shell model .",
    "for example the cr1 chondrites have total abundances just above @xmath21 ppb . if these meteorites are assumed to originate from locations within a parent body relatively closer to the core ( whereas the cr2 meteorites , with total abundances near @xmath2 ppb , would be in the in - between layers associated with cooler temperatures ) , we would expect our cr2 models in figure [ comparison ] to move towards @xmath21 ppb as temperatures increase .",
    "similarly , the cr3 chondrites , associated with the coolest alteration temperatures ( pertaining to locations within the parent body nearest to the surface ) , also have a slightly lower abundance than the cr2 meteorites ( near @xmath5 ppb for the only analyzed cr3 meteorite , que 99177 ) .",
    "however , our cr2 model shown in figure [ comparison ] does not tend towards lower abundances at the highest temperatures ( near 300@xmath1c ) , or at the lowest temperatures ( near 25@xmath1c ) thought to be in meteorite parent bodies of petrologic types 13 @xcite .",
    "the lack of such behavior suggests that one of the main drivers of amino acid synthesis in planetesimals is the amount of water and organics in the planetesimal and not the temperatures inside each layer .",
    "figure  [ waterpercent ] explores the effect of varying water content further by showing the dependence of theoretical total amino acid yields to overall water percentage in the model planetesimal .",
    "the simulation is done with cr - like aldehyde concentrations , at 100 bar and 100@xmath40c .",
    "these initial conditions are fairly arbitrary as figure  [ comparison ] shows how abundances are relatively the same across aqueous phase temperatures , and cr - like and cm - like initial compositions also produce similar curves .",
    "the black curve in both panels of figure  [ waterpercent ] illustrates how total amino acid abundance can change by varying the water content of the fiducial model planetesimal .",
    "the shaded boxes represent the minimum and maximum observed abundances in each of the carbonaceous chondrite subclasses , fit onto the simulation line . by drawing a line downwards from the bottom - left and top - right corners of each box",

    "can be fit into the ranges of observed abundances for all the carbonaceous chondrite subclasses in this study .",
    "this result supports a composition - differentiated model ; specifically , planetesimals with different overall water concentrations .",
    "the aqua , dark blue , and red data points correspond to percent uncombined water measured and/or reported by @xcite and @xcite in separate samples ( but the same body ) of some of the carbonaceous chondrites that have been used in this study .",
    "since the amino acid abundances and uncombined water content were not measured on the same sample , the amino acid abundance values for each data point correspond to the samples measured from the sources outlined in paper i ; with error bars corresponding to two or more sample measurements . the percent",
    "uncombined water values in @xcite and @xcite are measured by heating an uncovered sample to 110@xmath40c for 1 hour and measuring the loss in weight .",
    "the measured values for these data points therefore consist of both excess free water from weathering and original free water .",
    "notice in the left panel of figure  [ waterpercent ] how all of the data points lie to the right of the simulation line .",
    "this overabundance in measured uncombined water percent in comparison to our simulated values may be the result of substantial weathering .",
    "@xcite conclude that for a number of reasons , carbonaceous chondrites are more susceptible to weathering than other meteorite types and that even observed falls ( as opposed to finds ) may display the effects of significant weathering .",
    "the timescale for atmospheric , ground and/or rain water to be taken in by recently fallen meteorites could be very short : @xcite dehydrated a sample of the orgueil meteorite used in our study , and found that after only a few hours it had regained almost all the hygroscopic water that it had lost ( 9.15 wt% ) .    in attempts to quantify the amount of weathering endured by each meteorite",
    " and thus the corresponding excess free water in each sample  we look at the ratio of oxidized iron ( fe@xmath23o@xmath6 ) to metallic iron ( fe(m ) ) .",
    "the oxidation of fe(m ) into fe@xmath23o@xmath6 is a well known weathering effect @xcite , therefore this ratio could provide a relative scaling factor for each of the water content values of our data points .",
    "unfortunately this idea fails as none of our eight data samples yield non - zero and non - trace values for both oxidized and metallic iron .",
    "in the right panel of figure  [ waterpercent ] we apply a constant scaling factor of 0.01 to all the uncombined water percent values .",
    "this allows us to estimate the ratio of original free water to excess free water from weathering that would allow the data points to coincide better with our simulation curve . since individual samples will be subjected to distinct amounts of weathering , this 0.01 scaling factor is a simplification in attempts to typify the magnitude of excess water due to weathering in carbonaceous chondrites .",
    "so far we have , for simplicity , focused on the formation of amino acids without discussing other competing chemical pathways .",
    "this can not be ignored in general , and we now turn to a discussion of one of the main competing processes .",
    "hydroxy acids are similar to amino acids , except in place of the amino group ( nh@xmath23 ) , they have a hydroxyl group ( oh ) .",
    "the hydroxy acid analogous to glycine is glycolic acid , and the hydroxy acid analogous to alanine is lactic acid since hydroxy acids can also form from the strecker synthesis pathway @xcite , it is important to consider how the formation of hydroxy acids can reduce amino acid synthesis within meteorite parent bodies .",
    "a key point about this chemistry is the role of ammonia that is so essential for strecker synthesis . as nh@xmath6 concentrations decrease",
    ", one expects that amino acid production will fall with respect to hydroxy acid synthesis @xcite .",
    "table  [ hydroxy ] lists the hydroxy acid to analogous amino acid meteorite abundance fractions for these molecules , from five meteorite samples .",
    "the molecular abundances are obtained from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is a large variation in the hydroxy acid to analogous amino acid fractions between the ci1 , cm2 and cr2 meteorite subclasses . within cr2 meteorites ,",
    "there is only 0.040.09 times as many hydroxy acids as their analogous amino acids . in cm2 meteorites ,",
    "hydroxy acids are 128 times more abundant than their analogous amino acids . and most significantly , in the ivuna ci1 meteorite , hydroxy acids are 121274 times as abundant as their analogous amino acids .    within ci1 meteorite parent bodies ,",
    "the molecular fractions suggest that conditions could be more favourable for hydroxy acid formation over amino acid formation .",
    "if hydroxy acid production is favoured within ci1 meteorite parent bodies , it could explain why our simulations produce almost 3 orders of magnitude more total amino acids than are present in ci1 meteorites .",
    "this suggests that observed nh@xmath6 concentrations are positively correlated with amino acid synthesis within ci1 meteorite parent bodies , which is to be expected for strecker reactions .    within cr2 meteorite parent bodies on the other hand",
    ", there appears to be only a small fraction of hydroxy acids relative to their analogous amino acids .",
    "this could mean that there is sufficient nh@xmath6 within cr2 parent bodies allowing for optimal amino acid production .",
    "any variation in amino acid abundances between the various cr2 meteorites could then be mainly from variations in overall parent body water content ( as shown in section  [ water ] ) .",

    "nh@xmath6 concentrations could therefore be moderately affecting amino acid synthesis within cm2 meteorite parent bodies , leading to similar abundances of hydroxy and amino acids .",
    "this fits in well with the story thus far , as our simulations produce about an order of magnitude more amino acids than the cm2 meteoritic abundances , which could be explained by a moderate reduction of amino acid synthesis from relatively low nh@xmath6 concentrations .    to investigate the possible role of reduced nh@xmath6 as the ultimate cause of reducing amino acid synthesis within ci1 and cm2 meteorite parent bodies",

    "since cr2 meteorite parent bodies have the greatest amount of nh@xmath6 , amino acid synthesis should be favoured over hydroxy acid synthesis @xcite , which aligns well with our simulations and the meteoritic record .",
    "the cm2 meteorites however  especially in the case of the bells sample  have less nh@xmath6 than the ci1 meteorite .",
    "this does not fit perfectly with this picture , where amino acid abundances in ci1 meteorite parent bodies would seem to have been reduced more than in cm2 meteorite parent bodies , judging by the hydroxy acid to analogous amino acid ratios .",
    "this could perhaps partially be explained by the fact that water content within the petrographic type 1 meteorites tends to be higher than within the petrographic type 2 meteorites , which could have an effect on how diluted the ammonia is within the ci1 parent body .",
    "one limitation of our model is that amino acid decomposition pathways are not simulated .",
    "amino acids deaminate and decarboxylate in aqueous solutions at rates that vary with temperature @xcite .",
    "high - pressure , high - temperature laboratory experiments infer through extrapolation that for temperatures less than @xmath5060@xmath1c , some amino acids have half lives @xmath51 10@xmath52 years . these experiments also show that amino acids degrade rapidly at temperatures @xmath53 200@xmath1c .",
    "however , since at lower temperatures , amino acid decomposition reaction rates may be longer than the aqueous lifetime of a meteorite parent body ( @xmath5010@xmath52 years ) @xcite , it is reasonable to assume that not too much decay has occurred .",
    "the main exception would be if a meteorite parent body interior reaches temperatures @xmath53 200@xmath1c , but as we have shown in figures  [ cmfreq ] and [ crfreq ] , simulated relative frequency patterns diverge from the meteoritic values at 250@xmath1c .",
    "hence , since we expect that interior temperatures never reach above 200@xmath1c , decay effects should be minimal .",
    "the results of our simulations suggest a new picture of amino acid synthesis within planetesimals .",
    "total amino acid abundances within planetesimals remain relatively stable throughout the aqueous phase temperature range .",
    "this suggests that temperature and pressure are not the main driving factors for differences in amino acid abundances across meteorite types .",
    "we have already argued that hydroxy acid production could be favoured over amino acid production within certain meteorite parent bodies ( e.g. ci1 and cm2 ) , while amino acid production could be favoured over hydroxy acid production within others ( e.g. cr2 ) .",
    "this could be due to varying nh@xmath6 to water levels within these parent bodies .",
    "secondly , initial water content within the planetesimal , and the scaling organics within that water , could account for the variation of amino acid synthesis within meteorite parent bodies of the same subclass .",
    "this is demonstrated by the shaded boxes in figure  [ waterpercent ] , which show that varying the water content within cr2 meteorite parent bodies  whose amino acid abundances may not be curbed by low nh@xmath6 concentrations  from 0.0218 wt@xmath54 ( purple box ) , could account for the variation in cr2 meteoritic amino acid abundances .",
    "amino acid synthesis within ci1 , cm1 , cr1 , co3 and cv3 meteorite parent bodies on the other hand , could first be reduced due to relatively low nh@xmath6 concentrations , and then varied further by the ranges in their parent body water contents .",
    "the variation of water and ammonia within planetesimals is ultimately tied to where and how these bodies formed in their host protostellar disks .",
    "astrochemistry models for such systems are starting to become sophisticated enough to allow us to explore this connection ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our proposed picture conforms well with the water percentages measured in various chondrites in the literature .",
    "@xcite state that petrologic type 1 chondrites have the highest water content by weight ( 1822@xmath54 ) , followed by type 2 chondrites ( 216@xmath54 ) and then type 3 chondrites ( 0.33@xmath54 ) . figure  [ waterpercent ] shows that increasing the water content in the meteorite parent body leads to greater amino acid production . since ci1 meteorite parent bodies appear to have had the largest water percentages , the reduction of amino acid production from low nh@xmath6 concentrations within these parent bodies would have to be greater in order to produce the comparatively low amino acid abundances measured in ci1 meteorites .",
    "cr2 meteorite parent bodies on the other hand , which appear to have had mid - range water concentrations ( 216@xmath54 ) , have ranges in meteoritic amino acid abundances that can be explained almost completely with varying the water content within our simulations ( from 0.218@xmath54 ) .",
    "cm1 , cr1 , co3 and cv3 meteorite parent bodies would then require some level of amino acid abundance reduction ( by having relatively low nh@xmath6 concentrations ) , as well as an assortment of water contents , to account for their lower and varied meteoritic amino acid abundances .    in circumstellar disk models from @xcite and @xcite , ice water content along the mid - plane",
    "is found to increase swiftly ( but not instantaneously ) at the ice line , after which it changes only minimally for several au .",
    "the water content within each forming planetesimal varies as a function of its distance from the ice line . for the solar system ,",
    "the ice line during planet formation may have been somewhere within the asteroid belt , as modeled by @xcite ( at 2 and 2.5 au from the sun ) .",
    "most of earth s meteorites ( including carbonaceous chondrites ) are believed to originate from the asteroid belt . if the water ice distribution is inherited from the cicumstellar disk models explained above , then the proposed variation in water content between the parent bodies of the carbonaceous chondrites in our study could be possible .",
    "the variation of ammonia across protostellar disks has also been computed ( see review @xcite ) .",
    "it is known observationally that nh@xmath6 can be ruled out as a significant carrier of nitrogen in the warm inner regions of disks so that most of the nitrogen in the terrestrial planet forming region may be stored as n@xmath23 . at larger disk radii",
    ", nitrogen will be found in the form of ammonia , which explains its abundance in comets and in the atmospheres of giant planets . applied to our model",
    ", this suggests that if high ammonia levels secure dominant amino acid abundances , then the parent bodies for such meteorites would have derived from such outer disk regions beyond the terrestrial planet formation region .",
    "in general , we see good agreement between our thermodynamic computations and observed amino acid abundances .",
    "when applying our fiducial model , thermodynamics well explains the total amino acid concentrations we see in cr2 meteorites and the relative frequencies we see in both the cm2 and cr2 subclasses .",
    "our models for cm - type and cr - type total amino acid abundances at temperatures less than @xmath55c remain near 7x@xmath2 parts - per - billion ( ppb ) .",
    "this value is in agreement with the average observed abundance in cr2 meteorites of @xmath56x@xmath2 , but approximately an order of magnitude higher than the average observed abundance in cm2 meteorites of @xmath4x@xmath5 .",
    "these simulation results are not sensitive to slight changes in the initial aldehyde concentrations .",
    "for this reason we think the results will remain fairly similar regardless of whether relative amino acid abundances in hydrolyzed or unhydrolyzed meteorite extracts are used in calculations .",
    "an increase in the production of the competing hydroxy acids in the meteorite parent body can explain the discrepancy between the cm - type model computations and the observed amino acid abundances in cm2 meteorites .",
    "there is a sharp drop in total amino acid abundance at the liquid - to - gas phase transition of the aqueous solution .",
    "we attribute this drop - off to the decline in thermodynamic favourability of synthesizing amino acids once in a gaseous phase mixture .",
    "our models do not decrease in total amino acid abundance by any significant amount over the course of the aqueous phase temperature range .",
    "this lack of declination does not support a simple temperature - differentiated onion shell model .    instead , we propose a new explanation for amino acid abundances in planetesimals . in this new model ,",
    "the production of hydroxy acids is favoured over the production of amino acids within certain meteorite parent bodies ( e.g. ci1 and cm2 ) .",
    "this is likely due to the low nh@xmath6 concentrations within these parent bodies , which , as we have seen , results in lower amino acid production in preference to hydroxy acid production .",
    "( protoplanetary disk astrochemistry models predict low ammonia levels in the inner regions of disks . ) then , to get the variation in the amino acid abundances within the same carbonaceous chondrite subclasses , the total water content ( and scaling reactant content ) could vary from parent body to parent body .",
    "our model accounts for the relative frequency pattern in amino acids among cm2 and cr2 chondrites .",
    "the observed and theoretical frequencies with respect to glycine match to well within an order of magnitude in both cases , at a temperature of @xmath7c .",
    "the degradation of lysine and threonine for cm - type relative frequencies and of isoleucine for cr - type relative frequencies by @xmath47c and @xmath18c , is in agreement with 3d models of interiors of young planetesimals ; which are not heated much beyond @xmath45c .",
    "this change in amino acid frequencies may suggest a method to estimate internal meteorite parent body temperatures within that range .",
    "these various aspects of the amino acid record in meteorites point towards the deep connection that likely exists with local disk astrochemistry .",
    "in particular , the processes that determine the abundances of ammonia , water , and aldehyde concentrations at different disk radii and their incorporation into planetesimals ultimately provide the initial conditions for strecker synthesis of the amino acids .",
    "it is therefore possible to link biomolecule patterns in various types of meteorites to a much broader picture of disk astrochemistry .",

    "we are indebted to the excellent contributions of jeff emberson and darren fernandes who , during their undergraduate theses with rep at mcmaster , helped establish some of the basic methods used in the early phases of this work .",

    "in figure  [ appendixfigure1 ] we extend figure [ pressure ] ( gibbs free energy of formation for glycine ) to the other nine amino acids considered in our simulation , and order them by increasing gibbs free energy ( at fiducial values of 50@xmath40c and 100 bar ) .",
    "all amino acid curves are piecewise , and increase in gibbs free energy at the point of discontinuity .",
    "table  [ gibbsvalues ] displays exact values for the gibbs free energies of formation for each of the proteinogenic amino acids used in our simulation , plus one non - proteinogenic amino acid , at the fiducial temperature and pressure .",
    "it is worth noting that the order of amino acids in table  [ gibbsvalues ] does not directly match the order of amino acids in figure  [ cmfreq ] or figure  [ crfreq ] .",
    "this implies that the amount of each amino acid synthesized in planetesimals is dictated by more than just its energetic favourability .",
    "additional factors , such as the concentration of each aldehyde precursor , cause a dispersion in the ordering of relative amino acid abundances .",

    "since we have been basing our simulations on an aqueous phase chemical reaction ( strecker synthesis ) , comparing the gibbs energy of @xmath10-aminobutryric acid in the liquid phase to that of the proteinogenic amino acids is most important .",

    "7 of the 10 amino acid synthesis simulations are performed using the gibbs free energy data from aldehyde substitutes rather than the actual strecker precursors listed in table  [ aldehydes ] . due to the difference in steric configurations between the substitutes and the actual reactant aldehydes",
    ", we can assume that their gibbs free energies may also differ . in order to try to identify the difference between their gibbs free energies",
    ", we consulted the ayers group in the dept . of chemistry and chemical biology at mcmaster university , who performed an analysis using an electronic structure program called gassian ( f. zadeh , p. ayers and a. patel 2015 , personal communication ) .",
    "from their analysis , it is discovered that the substitutes which have exactly the same atoms as the actual aldehydes , i.e. , isobutryaldehyde ( val ) , 3-methyl butanal ( leu ) and 2-methyl butanal ( ile ) , have very similar gibbs free energies to the actual aldehydes . therefore the accuracy of the val , leu and ile synthesis simulations are likely not greatly affected by the aldehyde substitutions .",
    "the substitutes which do not have exactly the same atoms as the actual aldehydes , i.e. , 3-oxopropanoic acid ( asp ) , 5-aminopentanal ( lys ) , 4-oxobutanoic acid ( glu ) and lactaldehyde ( thr ) , were found to have a considerable difference in gibbs free energy to the actual strecker precursors .    in attempts to identify how greatly these four aldehyde substitutions might affect our amino acid synthesis results",
    ", we use the rough gibbs data computed from zadeh et al .",

    "we then rerun the cm - type simulations to compare to our previous results .",
    "we find that the reactions involving 3-oxopropanoic acid ( asp ) and 5-aminopentanal ( lys ) are not sensitive to the adjusted aldehyde gibbs energies .",
    "thus , there are only two reactions in this set , involving 4-oxobutanoic acid ( glu ) and 2-hydroxy - propanal ( thr ) , that are quite sensitive to adjustments in gibbs energies .",
