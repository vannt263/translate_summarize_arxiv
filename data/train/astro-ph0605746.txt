    "constraining the dark energy equation of state and density parameters is the objective of many cosmologists ; not few of them have considered using present or future cluster data to attain this goal .",
    "cluster methods rely mostly on detection and counting of objects using some mass - indicating observable ; for constraining cosmology there are 4 ways of finding clusters : optical emission by galaxies , the x - ray emission by the hot intracluster medium , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect on cmb , and gravitational lensing .",
    "x - ray clusters received a lot of attention from cosmologists @xcite , then sz clusters @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for thorough comparisons between the efficiency of extracting cosmological information from x - ray and sz clusters and also for using complementary studies of the cmb and supernovae distance measurements to improve constraints . for optically - detected cluster surveys and their results",
    "see the work of @xcite .",
    "the main issue with the x - ray , optical , and sz clusters is the so - called mass - observable relation : cluster masses are not measured directly , but they are estimated from the real observables , such as the x - ray temperature or flux or the sz integrated flux .",
    "but , as pointed out in @xcite , the mass - observable relation can have non - standard redshift evolution and , if not carefully calibrated , the constraints on dark energy parameters are compromised .",
    "cross - calibration of the mass - observable relations between different types of surveys could , though perhaps not very efficiently , ameliorate the situation ; more recently , self - calibration using the sample variance of the counts due to clustering of clusters has been proposed as a non - costly alternative to cross - calibration , eg see @xcite .",
    "weak gravitational lensing detects clusters via the slight distortions imparted on the images of background galaxies .",
    "the lensing information is obtained from shear maps : clusters are detected using some filtering technique that finds the points where the signal - to - noise ( @xmath7 ) is high enough for us to conclude that there is an overdensity .",
    "the filtered shear is the mass observable .",
    "the relation of this observable to the projected mass is very simple and unambiguous .",
    "the strength of the lensing method is this lack of ambiguity in the mass - observable relation .",
    "a difficulty arises because such a point with high @xmath7 does not necessarily correspond to a virialized cluster : it could also be the result of unvirialized large scale structure projected along the line of sight , or the superposition of multiple unrelated lower - mass objects @xcite .",
    "even for virialized clusters , there will be substantial scatter between the projected - mass observable and the traditionally defined virial mass @xcite .",
    "but there is in fact no underlying need for lensing observables to correspond to other cluster observables , nor even to a dynamical definition of mass .",
    "we will argue that counts of projected - mass overdensities are just as useful for cosmology as counts of virialized halos .",
    "in this paper we study how well a @xmath8dimensional parameter space can be constrained using weak - lensing - detected clusters .",
    "the parameters in question are @xmath9 ( the matter density parameter ) , @xmath10and @xmath11 ( the amplitude of the matter power spectrum ) . @xmath12 and @xmath13 define the time - varying equation of state of dark energy : @xmath14 .",
    "we use as examples two proposed future surveys , a ground - based large survey telescope ( lst ) @xcite and the space - based supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) @xcite .",
    "we first review the role of cluster - mass observables in constraining cosmology . in ",
    "[ snmax ] we describe a filter based on @xmath7 maximization of shear measurements that determines the minimum detectable mass of an object placed at a certain redshift . in  [ eonly ]",
    "we calculate the cosmological constraints obtained when assuming that the intrinsic ellipticities of background galaxies are the only source of noise . in  [ projection ]",
    "we treat the large scale structure projection errors and in  [ conc ] we draw some conclusions .",
    "the fiducial @xmath15cdm cosmological model for this whole paper is : flat universe , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , consistent with the first - year _ wmap _ results @xcite .",
    "any observable statistic can be used as a cosmological test , as long as ( 1 ) it can be measured on the real universe , and ( 2 ) its value can be predicted as a function of the cosmological parameters of interest .",
    "the utility of the statistic depends upon : the accuracy with which the measurement can be made ; the accuracy with which the _ predictions _ can be made ; and the sensitivity of the statistic to the parameters . to forecast the parameter accuracies , as we aim to do here , we need only estimate these three characteristics of the statistic .",
    "overdensity - counting methods have as their statistic the distribution @xmath22 of `` clusters '' in a solid angle @xmath23 vs redshift as a function of some observable quantity  [ the clustering of these overdensities may be an additional statistic ] . in an ideal world , the observable would be the virial mass @xmath24 , because there exist analytic frameworks @xcite for predicting their distribution , a.k.a . the mass function . to constrain dark energy at interesting levels",
    ", the mass function must be predicted to an accuracy that will undoubtedly require @xmath25-body simulations , not just the analytic frameworks . for more recent work on mass functions and their accuracy",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "this is also of course true for the real - life substitutes for virial mass : the x - ray flux / temperature , the sz decrement , galaxy counts , and the lensing shear .",
    "there is no long - term advantage to an observable that is closely correlated to the virial mass .",
    "the ultimate utility of these methods will depend upon the fidelity of the numerical predictions , and here the lensing method is clearly superior .",
    "the shear prediction needs only the mass distribution , and 83% of the mass is easily - modelled collisionless dark matter .",
    "x - rays and sz decrements depend fully upon the more complex baryon distribution , and the electron temperature as well . cooling and",
    "density fluctuations particularly affect the x - ray predictions .",
    "galaxy counts are even more difficult to predict",
    ". it would be bold to assert that modelling will ever predict any of these observables _ other _ than the shear to the percent - level accuracies we will someday desire .",
    "are analytic mass functions adequate for forecasting parameter accuracies ? to be so , they must roughly  but not exactly  predict the number of peaks in , so that our poisson errors are properly estimated .",
    "when  is a projected mass measurement , several numerical studies @xcite show that up to tens of percent of detections can be `` false positives '' in the sense of having no corresponding virialized cluster , and some virialized clusters are missed .",
    "the poisson statistics are grossly perturbed only when the @xmath7 threshold is low enough that measurement - noise peaks overwhelm the mass signals .",
    "the analytic model must also properly capture the dependence upon cosmological parameters .",
    "the `` false positives '' when  is the projected mass are not virialized , but they are real structures whose abundance will scale with @xmath11 and the linear growth rate in a manner not grossly different from the virialized structures @xcite .",
    "the projections which distinguish lensing - derived projected masses from dynamical masses can be divided into two classes : first , there are projections between mass structures that are widely separated along the line of sight , in which case there is no angular correlation between the projected halos . in  [ projection ]",
    "we treat such projections as a source of random noise on the mass determinations of detected clusters induced by projection of below - threshold halos .",
    "the second difference between lensing mass and virial mass is that the former includes all the structure along the line of sight that is correlated with the mass peak , not just the virialized ( or unvirialized ) core .",
    "the lensing `` mass function '' is therefore distinct from the mass function of virialized halos , but it is just as well defined .",
    "we will simply assume for this paper that the projected - mass function is equal to the virial - mass function produced by the press - schechter formalism and related techniques , in the absence of numerical or analytic evidence that the two differ dramatically .",
    "we conclude that the distinction between the weak - lensing projected - mass observable  and the virial mass @xmath24 will not be a barrier to its use as a precision cosmological constraint , and that we can use the virial mass functions for approximate forecasts of these constraints . naturally , for accurate constraints on dark energy , one will have to use a lensing mass function derived from numerical simulations .",
    "given a cluster at some redshift , we would like to determine the smallest value of its mass such that it could be detected through weak lensing ( wl ) effects . in this section",
    "we assume that the intrinsic ellipticities of the galaxies represent the dominant source of noise for the projected mass measurement .",
    "we shall test this assumption in  [ projection ] , where we consider the large scale projection effects .      as mentioned in the introduction , for wl measurements",
    "the observable is the shear , which encodes information about the direction and magnitude of the distortion of background galaxies images .",
    "the components of the shear contain derivatives of the deflection angle with respect to the apparent position of the source galaxy . in the case of wl ,",
    "distortions and magnifications are so small that we can very well approximate the relation between the components of the induced shear @xmath26 and those of the measured image ellipticity @xmath27 in the following way ( see @xcite for example ) : @xmath28 @xmath29 represents the intrinsic ellipticity of the galaxy . from measurements of @xmath25 galaxies ,",
    "the shear can be estimated with the accuracy : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the uncertainty in the measurement of one galaxy . for a detailed investigation of the shape noise ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "an approximate expression is @xcite : @xmath32    a filtered shear map is used to detect clusters by selecting the points where the @xmath7 peaks above some threshold , @xmath33 .",
    "but the filtered shear values are also used in the interpretation of the detected clusters .",
    "we are at liberty to choose any filtering method we wish , provided we can tie its results to a physical quantity for which there exists a theory .",
    "we choose to normalize our filter to reproduce the virial mass when applied to canonical clusters , namely spherically symmetric objects , with nfw density profiles in the context of a @xmath15cdm cosmology  i.e .",
    "what we expect the average ( if not typical ) cluster profiles to be .",
    "this close scaling will allow us to use the well - studied and tested mass function theory to predict the number of detectable clusters .",
    "therefore , the two requirements for our filter are first that it yield a value closely related to the virial mass for canonical clusters ; and second , that the virial mass estimator produce a maximum @xmath7 from the shear map .    for a circularly symmetric lens ,",
    "the shear has only one component , tangent to the annulus about the cluster center .",
    "we define our mass estimator as a weighted sum of the shears in such annuli : @xmath34 where @xmath35 designates the annulus with angular radius @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the measured shear of annulus @xmath35 on sources in redshift bin @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the weight on this shear .",
    "the variance of this estimator is : @xmath40 .",
    "\\label{eq : fullvar}\\ ] ] when the noise of the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies is dominant , the contributions of different redshift bins to the estimator variance are uncorrelated and the above expression reduces to : @xmath41 the desired maximization of @xmath7 is obtained for the following set of @xmath42 s : @xmath43 the normalization constant in equation  ( [ eq : w ] ) is set by the first property of our filter : if the real clusters have nfw profiles and the real cosmology is @xmath15cdm , then the estimator must return the virial mass of the clusters .",
    "thus , the constant is : @xmath44 the shear and the optimal weight separate into a part depending only on the lens properties , and a part depending only on the lens and source redshifts . for redshift bin @xmath38 we write : @xmath45 in the above equation , @xmath46 is the shear of a hypothetical source at infinity , @xmath47 is the redshift distribution of source galaxies ( see  [ details ] ) and @xmath48 is given by : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the angular - diameter distance between the lens and the source and @xmath51 is the angular - diameter distance between theobserver and the source . throughout this paper",
    "we consider only the case of a flat universe . in the limit of an infinite number of redshift bins and if we introduce the shear per unit mass for the canonical cluster , @xmath52 , equation  ( [ eq : z1 ] ) becomes : @xmath53 to make the notation easier , we shall ignore the dependence on @xmath54 of @xmath55 and @xmath56 . using the normalization constant defined by equation  ( [ eq : constant ] ) , we obtain for the noise of the measurement : @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath48 evaluated for the nfw profile and a @xmath15cdm cosmology",

    "@xmath65 is the change of the estimated mass from the true virial mass if the cosmology is different from @xmath15cdm : @xmath66 @xmath67 is the tangential shear per unit mass for a @xmath15cdm cosmology .",

    "note that if @xmath69 is independent of cosmology , then @xmath70 is simply a ratio of angular - diameter distances .",
    "more generally , the parameters of the nfw profile of a cluster of given @xmath71 will depend upon cosmology .",
    "the variance of the mass estimator , written also in the case of continuous annuli is : @xmath72 here we have considered a constant angular concentration of galaxies . for the upper bound of the second integral in the above equation we take @xmath73 , with @xmath74 the virial radius of the measured cluster .",
    "this choice of @xmath75 seems a reasonable trade - off for looking widely enough to get a significant signal without too much contamination by other lensing structures .",
    "a cluster is detectable if its mass estimator has a minimum value of @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the detection threshold that we choose for our measurement and @xmath78 is given by equation  ( [ eq : noise3 ] ) .",
    "let us emphasize again that only in the case of a canonical cluster ( nfw profile in a @xmath15cdm cosmology ) does our estimator translate the shear signal into the cluster s virial mass . if the cosmology is changed from @xmath15cdm , the same shear signal results from a different virial mass , as one can see from equation  ( [ eq : mtilda2 ] ) .",
    "but even so we are still able to find and count objects . since @xmath25-body simulations will yield the functional dependence on cosmology of the difference between the estimated and the virial mass , we can still understand our counts and know how to extract cosmological constraints from them .",
    "the measurement is well - defined for clusters that do not have the canonical nfw profile , but in this paper we do not attempt numerical simulations to derive the effect of this difference on wl cluster counts .",
    "we now present a few steps that we take in order to compute the variance given by equation  ( [ eq : noise3 ] ) .",
    "we assume the source galaxies to have the redshift distribution introduced by @xcite and used in many other works , e.g. see @xcite : @xmath79 the mean of this distribution is @xmath80 ; the characteristics of the fiducial survey will set the value of @xmath81 .    as already specified , we optimize our filter for spherically symmetric clusters with nfw profiles and in a @xmath15cdm cosmology .    a thorough treatment of nfw lenses is given by @xcite , as well as by @xcite .",

    "they estimate about 200000 clusters are detectable , @xmath190 higher than our nominal estimate . if we assume their input values , our optimal filter yields about 700000 clusters , demonstrating the advantage of an optimal filter .",
    "the last issue that we discussed is that of the projection contamination , considered the sword of damocles for wl measurements . from the beginning",
    "we make a crucial approximation : we identified the projected mass of clusters with their virial mass . this need not be true on a cluster - by - cluster basis , just in the sense that the mass functions have similar amplitude and dependence upon cosmological parameters . with this assumption  which needs to be verified numerically  about the effect of _ local _ structure on projected - mass estimates , we can next treat the projection of _ unrelated _ structures along the line of sight as a noise source , not a bias .",
    "wl cluster measurements are subject to two major sources of noise : the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies ( shape noise ) and these large scale projections .",
    "we find that , even when we use an overdensity - detection filter optimized for pure shape noise , that the projection noise is dominant only for lenses at @xmath191 , and has little effect upon the derived dark - energy constraints in most applications of our canonical ground ( lst ) and space ( snap ) wl cluster surveys .",
    "let us stress again that all these numbers are extremely sensitive to the detection threshold and the noise levels that we impose . if @xmath111 , the number of detectable clusters goes down by a factor of 10 in the case of shape noise only and by more than a factor of 18 when we also account for projections .",
    "then the errors on the dark energy equation of state parameters are as much as tripled",
    ". if the noise has gaussian statistics , as we would expect for shape noise , then the @xmath192 threshold will suffice to keep false positives to an unimportant level .",
    "the projection noise will not , however , be gaussian , so further investigation is required to determine whether the @xmath192 threshold offers enough suppression .",
    "the numerical study of @xcite suggests this is the case , as their @xmath193 threshold results in a false - positive contamination of only 25% .",
    "recall that this work considers any object not associated with a virialized halo to be a false positive , whereas we assert that counting unvirialized objects is a valid cosmological test , so this 25% `` contamination '' still carries cosmological information .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that counting of wl - detected clusters can be a powerful constraint on cosmology with either space- or ground - based surveys .",
    "while projection effects make it difficult to establish a one - to - one correspondence between wl - derived masses and virial masses , there is no real need to make such a correspondence in order to infer cosmological parameters from wl data .",
    "indeed it is precisely the ability to go directly from @xmath25-body simulations to wl - derived masses that makes wl cluster counting an attractive alternative to optical , x - ray , or sz cluster counting .",
    "our fisher analysis incorporates the cosmological dependence of the conversion from shear to mass units , plus the effect of sample variance and projection noise , and we show that none of these are barriers to strong dark - energy constraints .",
