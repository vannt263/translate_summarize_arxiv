    "the visible mass of a galaxy is intimately related to the process of its formation , indicating how , during its cosmological history , the primordial baryon - to - total density ratio @xmath11 has been modified .",
    "furthermore , the inventory of stars and gas in galaxies sheds light on where the bbn baryons reside at the present time , and helps to investigate the nature of the baryonic structures observed at high @xmath9 .    in this connection ,",
    "a step forward was made by persic & salucci ( 1992 ; hereafter ps92 ) who estimated the cosmological density of the baryonic matter in spirals @xmath12 ( and in other bound systems ) by averaging the spirals disc masses @xmath13 over their luminosity function ( lf ) , @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the critical mass density of the universe , .",

    "our knowledge of the properties of spirals has improved enormously in the past few years .",
    "in fact , with respect to ps92 , we can now rely on : _ ( a ) _ lfs deeper by about 5 magnitudes and resolved by hubble type ; _ ( b ) _ hi mass estimates for objects spanning the whole luminosity range of disc systems ; _ ( c ) _ determinations of disc masses for sa and dwarf spirals ; _",
    "( d ) _ refined derivations of disc and bulge masses in normal spirals .    based on this new knowledge , we investigate two crucial ( and timely ) cosmological issues : the baryonic mass function of disc systems , and the connection between the population of local spirals and that of high-@xmath9 damped ly-@xmath10 clouds ( dlas ) .    as the halo mass function carries direct information on the spectrum of primordial cosmological perturbations and the luminosity function",
    "reflects the evolution of the stellar populations of galaxies , the baryonic mass function of disc systems ( dmf ) is a unique probe into the late stages of their formation , including the dark - to - luminous coupling that has formed spirals as we see them today .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the spiral lf and ( disc mass)-vs .- luminosity relation . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we estimate the dmf and the amount of baryons locked in spirals . in section 5",
    "we investigate the connection between spirals and dlas .",
    "finally , in section 6 we briefly discuss some cosmological implications .",
    "recent large surveys have obtained the lf of galaxies down to m@xmath25 . system . when transformed from the @xmath26 system ,",
    "the adopted conversion is @xmath27 . ]",
    "the standard schechter ( 1976 ) function , @xmath28 is generally found to give an excellent fit to the data ( efstathiou et al .",

    "; lin et al . 1996 ; radcliffe et al . 1998 ) .",
    "however , for m@xmath29 , there is a significant excess of objects above the schechter prediction ( e.g. , loveday 1998 ) .",
    "we consider the two cases seperately .    .",
    "( i ) : _ m@xmath30 .    with respect to the earlier aars survey , the autofib redshift survey ( 1700 objects ; ellis et al .",
    "1996 ) has filled the gap @xmath31 in the coverage of apparent magnitudes , and has significantly increased the size of the sample down to @xmath32 .",
    "this has made it possible to determine the lf for each spiral hubble type , down to m@xmath33 , with an accurate estimate of the faint - end slope and the overall normalization ( heyl et al .",
    "1997 ) . in detail , we take the heyl et al . (",
    "1997 ) sa lf and we combine the remaining three sb - sdm lfs into a single late - type lf ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the parameters of these two schechter functions are reported in table 1 .",
    "the values of @xmath10 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 vary , field by field and survey by survey . the typical uncertainties involved in the determination of @xmath10 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( lin et al . 1996 ; radcliffe et al . 1998 ) are : 0.05 , @xmath38 , and 0.1 mag , respectively .    the observational input is further increased by considering also the spiral lf of marzke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , built from the morphology of the objects rather than from their spectral features : the relative schechter parameters are given in table 1 .",
    "for later considerations let us notice that , from the above lfs , the value of the parameter @xmath39 relative to the entire spiral population is : @xmath40 .",
    "finally , for @xmath41 , both lfs neglect low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , which constitute a very small ( and uncertain ) fraction of the whole population of disc systems at these luminosities ( sprayberry et al . 1997 ; see also next subsection ) .    _",
    "( ii ) _ m@xmath42 .",
    "the 2.4-million - galaxy apm survey has provided the first direct information on the very faint end of the lf , reaching m@xmath43 .",
    "it has found , faintwards of m@xmath44 , an increasing excess of galaxies with respect to the schechter profile , mostly of late - type morphology and low surface brigthness ( loveday 1998 ; see also marzke et al .",
    "1994 , lin et al .",
    "1996 , zucca et al .",
    "this rapid increase can be taken into account by adding to the standard lf an additional power - law term that switches on at m@xmath29 and becomes comparable to the schechter term at @xmath45 ( see loveday 1998 ) .",
    "thus , the luminosity function of disc systems can be written as : @xmath46 with @xmath47 given by eq.(2a ) and @xmath48 ( loveday 1998 ) .        using a very large dataset of 1100 high - quality rotation curves ( rcs ) and a newly devised method of mass modelling , persic et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have determined the stellar disc and bulge masses of sb - sdm normal spirals ( @xmath49 ) as a function of blue luminosity ( see also salucci & persic 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , recent rc analyses have provided the stellar disc masses for a number of dwarf galaxies , @xmath50m@xmath51 [ see salucci & persic ( 1997 ) and references therein ] . combining these results we find ( @xmath52 ) : @xmath53\\   m_\\odot \\eqno(3a)\\ ] ] @xmath54\\ , , \\eqno(3b)\\ ] ] that links the stellar mass and the luminosity of disc systems in a way quite different from the simple @xmath55 law ( see fig.2 ) .    the uncertainty @xmath56 ranges from @xmath57 at the highest luminosities to @xmath58 at the lowest luminosities .",
    "however , the actual disc mass variance for galaxies of a given luminosity , @xmath59 , is larger in that it also includes a variance due to observational errors plus an intrinsic component @xmath60 . this latter uncertainty , which must be taken into account when convolving the mass - to - light ratios with the luminosity function , can be estimated from the values of the disc masses derived for individual galaxies .",
    "using @xmath61 objects in persic & salucci ( 1990a ) , salucci et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , and persic et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , we conservatively estimate : @xmath62 .    the quantity @xmath63 is often related to the mean scatter of the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation , @xmath64 ( e.g. , willick 1998 ) .",
    "we stress that there is no _ direct _ link between these two quantities .",
    "in fact , at a fixed luminosity : @xmath65 ( salucci et al . 1993 ) , where @xmath66 is the disc size , @xmath67 is the disc - to - total mass fraction inside @xmath66 , and @xmath68 is the cosmic log - variance of the quantity @xmath69 convolved with its measurement errors . nevertheless , since @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( e.g. , persic et al . 1996 )",
    ", we can state that the variance of the tf relation and that of eq.(3 ) are mutually consistent .",
    "note that the mass vs. luminosity relation assumed here is robust with respect to the particular method employed in deriving the disc masses . in fig.2",
    ", we plot the @xmath72@xmath73 relationship corresponding to @xmath13 obtained _ ( 1 ) _ as maximum - disc solutions ( persic & salucci 1990b ) , and _ ( 2 ) _ via stellar population synthesis models ( salucci et al .",
    "1991 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the differences with the rc - slope - best - fit values used to derive eq.(3 ) are irrelevant to the main results of this paper .",
    "the bulge and disc masses of sa galaxies are obtained from : _ ( a ) _ dynamical modelling of the line - of - sight dispersion velocity profiles ( of either the stars and/or the gas ) and/or of the extended hi and optical rcs ; and _",
    "( b ) _ comparing the observed galaxy spectra with stellar population synthesis templates ( e.g. : corsini et al . 1999 ; bertola et al .",
    "1993 , 1998 ; silva et al . 1998 ; honma & sofue 1997 ; quillen & frogel 1997 ; jablonka & arimoto 1992 ) .",
    "given that sa galaxies contribute significantly to the spiral lf only in the very small range of magnitudes @xmath74 , the @xmath2320 objects available in the literature turn out to be sufficient to determine an average mass - to - light ratio in this region and to establish its trend with luminosity .",
    "we find that the stellar masses increase with luminosity slightly more steeply than linear , in good agreement with eq.(3 ) .",
    "however , the mass - to - light ratios of sa galaxies are a factor of order two larger than the corresponding values for late spirals .",
    "we therefore assume : @xmath75 .",
    "[ the main results of this paper do not depend on the ( suitable ) actual value assumed for this proportionality constant .",
    "]      hi masses have recently been derived , through hi - flux observations , for two large samples of spirals that include also irregular dwarfs ( hoffman et al .",
    "1996 ; rhee 1996 ) .",
    "the data for the combined sample ( @xmath76 ) imply a strong @xmath77 relation ( see fig.3 ) , especially so if it is reckoned that this is steeper at lower masses than at higher masses ( hoffman et al .",
    "1996 ; salpeter & hoffman 1996 ) .",
    "in detail , we have : @xmath78   \\eqno(4)\\ ] ] ( see salpeter & hoffman 1996 for further details ) .",
    "to take the helium contribution into account , we multiply the r.h.s . of eq.(4 ) by 1.33 .",
    "two other disc - like gaseous components are present in spirals : _ ( i ) _ molecular gas ( @xmath79 , co ) which , however , being distributed as the exponential stellar disc , is already taken into account by @xmath72 ; and _ ( ii ) _ ionized hydrogen ( found by pioneering h@xmath10-emission measurements , see bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "1997 ) , the mass of which is , however , difficult to estimate , also because the hi / hii transition has a sharp edge ( corbelli & schneider 1997 ) . for the time",
    "being we consider the hii component as provisionally unidentified baryonic dark matter .",
    "the baryonic masses of disc systems are then obtained from eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) : @xmath80 we emphasize that these determinations are more accurate than those in ps92 in the following respects : _ ( i ) _ they hold down to @xmath234 magnitudes fainter ; _ ( ii ) _ they include the gaseous disc mass ; _ ( iii ) _ they bear smaller theoretical and observational uncertanties ; and _ ( iv ) _ they allow us to take into account the population of lsb galaxies whose hi masses , much larger than their corresponding stellar masses ( e.g. , de blok et al . 1996 ) , are well represented by eq.(4 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that these improvements , while absolutely needed to derive the spiral baryonic mass function , imply refinements on @xmath6 ( as estimated by ps92 ) that are too small to affect the ps92 claim @xmath81 .",
    "we investigate disc systems in the luminosity range between @xmath82 and @xmath83 , corresponding to the mass range between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "massive ( @xmath86 ) discs are rare objects , while light discs ( @xmath87 ) constitute the most numerous population of galaxies in the universe : the lowest masses considered here reflect the lack of suitable data , not the lack of objects .",
    "stellar disc masses are known only for @xmath88 : however , at these luminosities the gas mass given by eq.(4 ) is , by far , the main baryonic component .    by using eqs.(2)-(5 )",
    "we derive the disc ( systems ) mass function ( dmf ) , @xmath89 , defined as from the conservation of the number of galaxies . ] : @xmath90 we take into account the scatter of the @xmath91 relation by convolving the r.h.s of eq.(6 ) with a gaussian of half - width @xmath92 corresponding to the maximum cosmic variance in relationship ( 3 ) .",
    "fig.4 shows that the dmf can be well described by a power law @xmath93 over three decades in mass , different from the lf that can hardly be reproduced by a power law over more than a decade in luminosity .",
    "a good fit for the dmf is : @xmath94   \\big({m_b\\over m_b^{\\oplus}}\\big)^{-0.46 } e^{-\\big ( { m_b\\over m_b^\\oplus}\\big)}\\ , , \\eqno(7)\\ ] ] where @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    at the highest masses ,",
    "the dmf shows a sharp cutoff that noticeably occurs at a mass @xmath97 ( with @xmath98 ) , quite different from the baryonic mass corresponding to @xmath99 , the knee \" of the spiral lf ( e.g. : heyl et al .",
    "1997 ; marzke , 1998 ) .",
    "this supports the scenario in which spirals were formed under an upper mass limit , @xmath100 , due to the inability of a larger baryonic mass to cool fast enough to settle into a disc within a hubble time ( rees & ostriker 1977 ; see also thoul & weinberg 1996 ) .",
    "this sharp cutoff gets broadened in the lf ( figs . 4 and 5 ) because the radiating efficiencies of stellar discs of a given mass have a significant scatter , due to differences in the discs stellar populations ( see oliva et al .",
    "1995 ) .    at @xmath101",
    ", there is a steepening of the dmf , parallel to that of the lf , that might hint to a bimodal distribution . in any case , also in the dmf there is no sign that downwards of the smallest observed masses , @xmath102 , the objects are disappearing .",
    "let us notice that the intrinsic variance of the @xmath91 relationship has negligible effect on the dmf , both because the latter is essentially a power law and because @xmath103 is much smaller than the range of log@xmath5 .    finally , the main features of the dmf do not depend on which ( suitable ) lf is assumed : the marzke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) lf yields a dmf very similar to eq . ( 7 ) ( see fig.7 in the appendix . )    despite the baryonic mass function being essentially featureless , spirals do have a characteristic mass scale : @xmath104 . in fig.(5 ) we show @xmath105 , the differential contribution to @xmath6 from spirals belonging to intervals of width 0.3 centered on log@xmath5 : in spite of the wide range of baryonic mass ( 5 decades : 24 intervals ) , the major contribution to @xmath6 ( @xmath106 ) comes from objects within a factor 3 of @xmath104 .",
    "thus , spirals do form with masses in the range @xmath107 : but most of the galactic baryons are actually locked at one specific mass scale , @xmath104 , higher than the mass of an @xmath39 galaxy and much higher than the mass of the great majority of the objects .",
    "actually , more than @xmath108 of the total baryonic mass is segregated in less than @xmath109 of the objects !",
    "conversely , the light is much more evenly distributed among galaxies of different luminosities : e.g. , objects with @xmath110 still contain more than @xmath38 of the total light .    as a consequence ,",
    "the `` typical '' scale @xmath39 does not have a cosmological significance , neither as the most relevant mass scale nor as the mass at which the mass function cuts off . at @xmath39",
    "the mass function is still increasing , with most of the cosmological baryon mass density located at @xmath111 .",
    "let us refine the ps92 estimate of the cosmological density of the stellar component in disc systems with the improved lf and mass - vs .- light relation of the previous sections . from eqs.(2)-(5 )",
    "we have : @xmath112 marginally larger and substantially more accurate than the ps92 estimate . the marzke et al .",
    "( 1998 ) lf yields : @xmath113 .",
    "let us notice that if we neglect the ( relevant ) presence of dark matter inside @xmath66 and/or the luminosity dependence of the ( stellar + gas ) mass - to - light ratio , we are led to overestimate @xmath6 by up to a factor of 4 and to fictitiously reduce the observed discrepancy between @xmath12 and @xmath114 .    as a finer detail in eq.(8 ) , the amount of hi+hei in spirals is @xmath115 this is in good agreement with the cosmological hi content , @xmath116 , estimated by integrating the hi mass function of zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , especially considering that the latter may include the s0 discs , neglected in our present estimate .    with the caveat that the masses of ellipticals and spheroidals are still uncertain by @xmath117 ( salucci & persic 1997 ) , let us estimate @xmath118 , the cosmological baryonic mass density in ellipticals and s0 .",
    "by means of the e / s0 autofib lf and the ps92 mass  luminosity relation ( see also salucci & persic 1997 ) , we find @xmath119 , in agreement with ps92 and with salucci et al .",
    "spheroids then store about twice as much baryonic matter as discs , differently from the common belief of an equipartion of the baryonic matter between discs and spheroids ( e.g. , schechter & dressler 1987 ) .",
    "instead , we point out that with respect to spirals , ellipticals have about 1/10 of the number density , 1/2 of the luminosity density and 2 times the baryonic mass density .",
    "the total amount of baryons in galaxies is then @xmath120 .",
    "it is remarkable that the star formation rate density , derived from the [ oii ] luminosity function ( hogg et al .",
    "1998 ) , when integrated over the lifetime of the universe , implies [ caveat a set of ( well justified ) assumptions on the imf , metallicity and extinction ] a very similar density of formed stars , @xmath121 .",
    "at high redshifts ( @xmath122 ) , the damped ly@xmath10 clouds , i.e. neutral - hydrogen absorbers with column densities @xmath123 atoms @xmath124 , dominate the cosmological mass density of the gas in cosmic structures .",

    "[ the earlier ps92 estimate was @xmath140 .",
    "] indeed , the baryonic content of spirals just reaches that of dlas [ the opposite claim ( e.g. , storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "1996b ) is induced by overestimates of the spiral @xmath141 ratios ] : this coincidence is straightforwardly explained if dlas are the progenitors of present - day spirals ( wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ; tytler 1987 ; maloney 1992 ; lanzetta et al .",
    "1995 ; kauffmann 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , the existence of a narrow mass range at @xmath142 for the @xmath143-dominating objects may give support to the single - population model which identifies dlas as discs rotating at one same high rotation speed , @xmath144 km s@xmath18 ( prochaska & wolfe 1997 , 1998 ) .",
    "let us investigate further the putative link between dlas and spirals by comparing the cosmological distribution of their masses .",
    "the scenario in which dlas are progenitors of @xmath145 discs yields a one - to - one link between a present - day spiral of mass @xmath5 and a high-@xmath9 dla of mass @xmath146 . with the assumption that spirals",
    "have retained most of the baryon content of their dla progenitors ( assumption supported by the similar cosmological densities of the two populations ) , we postulate : @xmath147 .",
    "it is , then , remarkable that the latter is fully consistent with the column density distribution of eq.(10 ) if a suitable relationship exists between the central face - on column densities and the dla masses .",
    "in fact , discs of the same mass having exponential surface density profiles with same lengthscale will produce a range of observed column densities , both because of having different inclinations and because of having a range of impact parameters for different lines of sight .",

    "<S> the integral value , @xmath8 , confirms , to a higher accuracy , previous evidence ( persic & salucci 1992 ) that the fraction of bbn baryons locked in disc galaxies is negligible and matches that of high-@xmath9 damped ly@xmath10 systems ( dlas ) . </S>",
