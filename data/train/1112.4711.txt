    "stable synchronization of two systems on the other hand occurs when deviations between the system states decay with time ( negative transversal lyapunov exponent ) .",
    "the contradiction between these two characteristics is only apparent because the decay and amplification occur in different directions in phase space .",
    "perturbations within the , i.e. , the manifold on which the states of the two systems are identical , grow due to a positive lyapunov exponent within this manifold giving rise to the chaotic dynamics . on the other hand , perturbations transversal to the , associated with deviations between the two systems , decay due to a negative transverse lyapunov exponent , thus leading to stable synchronization .",
    "another aspect is the influence of delayed coupling , since time delay renders the phase space infinite - dimensional and may on one hand induce instabilities and bifurcations , or may on the other hand stabilize unstable states @xcite .",
    "semiconductor lasers are of particular interest in the study of chaos synchronization .",
    "the synchronization properties may lead to potential applications , e.g. , to new secure communication schemes @xcite .",
    "however , it is impossible to synchronize chaos in two delay - coupled systems without self - feedback for large delays because the synchronized solution is always transversely unstable . in coupled lasers this effect leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking , and",
    "only generalized synchronization of leader - laggard type occurs @xcite .",
    "however , chaos synchronization of two delay coupled systems can be stable if each system has self - feedback . for semiconductor lasers",
    "this has been realized with a passive relay in form of a semitransparent mirror or an active relay in form of a third laser in between the two lasers @xcite .",
    "these structures are thus interesting for chaos based communication systems .    for practical applications",

    "we will first discuss the approach and since we are interested in delay coupled systems , we will do this in the context of networks with delay @xcite .",

    "recently this theory has been generalized to the scaling of floquet exponents @xcite . in both cases the eigenvalues or floquet spectrum consist of two parts : a strongly unstable part arising from unstable eigenvalues of the system without delay and a pseudo - continuous spectrum , for which the real part of the eigenvalues approach zero in the limit of large delay .",

    "for the parameters used in panel ( b ) the dynamics exhibits so - called _ strong chaos _",
    "strong chaos is characterized by a lyapunov exponent that stays constant with increasing delay time . as recently shown @xcite chaos synchronization is not possible in the large delay limit for strong chaos .",
    "the other case of _ weak chaos _ occurs when the largest lyapunov exponent scales as @xmath110 for @xmath63 . in this case chaos synchronization is possible and the critical radius is determined by @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the maximum lyapunov exponent of the system @xcite .",
    "we now propose an experimental method for determining the critical radius @xmath100 .",
    "consider two elements coupled in the following network motif @xmath192 where @xmath75 and @xmath193 are the self feedback strengths and the coupling strengths , respectively .",
    "suppose we are able to change the self - feedback strengths @xmath75 and the coupling strengths @xmath193 , for example by using gray filters in an optical experiment .",
    "let us choose @xmath194 then the dynamics in the is given by @xmath195 while the variational equation transverse to the is given by @xmath196 thus by changing @xmath99 ( for fixed @xmath26 ) and checking whether the two elements synchronize we are able to probe the along the real axis at the radius @xmath99 .",
    "due to the monotonicity we can use a root - finding algorithm such as the bisection method to find @xmath100 to high accuracy with little iterations of the experiment and without knowledge of the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we can repeat this procedure for other values of @xmath26 and obtain the critical radius as a function of @xmath197 .",
    "thus from this rather simple setup we can decide for any network of these elements whether synchronization is stable or not .    as an example we consider two optoelectronically coupled lasers    [ eq : optoelectronic - coupling ] @xmath198    where @xmath199 and @xmath200 is the intensity and the carrier density of the @xmath8th laser , respectively .",
    "the pump current of each laser is modulated by the delayed intensities according to the coupling scheme depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp - r0 ] .",
    "such feedback can be realized by using photodiodes to measure the intensities of the arriving signals and modulating the pump current accordingly .",
    "the bidirectional coupling has strength @xmath193 and the self - feedback of each laser has strength @xmath75 .",

    "we consider the systems to be synchronized , if the relative synchronization error @xmath203}\\ ] ] is smaller than a threshold @xmath204 .",
    "we then simulate the system and use the bisection method to find the synchronization threshold @xmath100 ( up to a desired accuracy ) in the interval @xmath205 .",
    "we can then use the calculated value of @xmath100 as an initial guess for neighboring @xmath26-values and thus follow the curve @xmath197 .",

    "the system becomes chaotic and @xmath208 . for a given value of @xmath26",
    ", a network has a stable synchronized solution if and only if all transversal eigenvalues @xmath28 of the corresponding coupling matrix have magnitude @xmath209 .     as a function of @xmath26 ( solid curve ) for the system of",
    "optoelectronically coupled lasers corresponding to eqs .  .",
    "a network can only have a stable synchronized solution if the magnitudes of its transversal eigenvalues are below the curve .",
    "the curve is calculated up to an absolute error of @xmath210 .",
    "the dashed line shows the diagonal line @xmath206 .",
    "+ parameters : @xmath211 , @xmath212 , @xmath213 , @xmath214 . ]",
    "a similar method has been implemented in @xcite . here",
    "the structure of the was confirmed experimentally using optoelectronic oscillators .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that the has a simple structure in the limit of large delay : it is rotationally symmetric around the origin and either positive and constant ( if it is positive at the origin ) or monotonically increasing and becomes positive at a minimum radius @xmath100 .",
    "this structure allowed us to prove a recent conjecture @xcite about synchronizability of chaotic elements .",
    "furthermore , we classified network structures into three types depending on the magnitude of the maximum transversal eigenvalue in relation to the magnitude of the row sum and showed that these network types have distinct synchronization properties . using several prototype networks like all - to - all or ring topologies we illustrated the scope of these three classes . by means of a motif of two coupled nodes with feedback loops , we proposed a very simple scheme with which the critical radius @xmath100 can be found experimentally .",
    "instead of mapping out the entire domain of the master stability function , the knowledge of the rotational symmetry allows the two - node motif to predict stability of any network using the same local dynamics in the case of large delay times .",
    "the rotational symmetry of the has previously been found numerically @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the same structure of the has been found for a in the for which the period @xmath129 is approximately equal to the delay time @xmath1 .",
    "for this case the structure of the has also been derived analytically in @xcite .",
    "note that this case is complementary to the situation @xmath215 that we looked at in this paper .",
