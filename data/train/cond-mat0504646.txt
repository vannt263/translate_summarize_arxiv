    "recent years there have been increased research activities toward the understanding , characterization , and fabrication of a scalable quantum computer ( qc ) [ 1 ] , due to the invention of efficient quantum algorithm and quantum error correction . among more than twenty kinds of implementation proposals ,",
    "the silicon - based qc architecture has attracted much enthusiasm , ever since kane s seminal proposal [ 2 ] in 1998 .",
    "the existing microelectronics technology can provide significant insights and huge resources during the development of a silicon - based qc , giving it significant advantage over other qc candidates .    in kane s scheme ,",
    "the nuclear spins of @xmath2 dopant atoms embedded in a silicon host , were proposed as the elementary qc units , or qubits .",
    "the resonance frequency for a nuclear spin can be tuned by the hyperfine interaction between electron and nuclear spins , which is controlled via a gate electrode , the so - called a - gate , over each qubit .",
    "thus , a globally applied a. c. magnetic field can realize arbitrary rotations on selected nuclear spins .",
    "a j - gate ( combined with a - gate ) , placed over the middle of neighboring donors , allows a controllable qubit - qubit interaction by varying the exchange coupling between the mediating donor electrons via the change of potential barrier between neighboring qubits .",
    "obviously , this proposal requires a delicate spin transfer between electrons and nuclei for read - in - read - out of quantum data and multi - qubit operation .",
    "there also exist variations to the original kane theme [ 3,4,5,6 ] , to circumvent the difficulties or simplify the qc implementation .",
    "vrijen et al [ 3 ] suggest utilizing the full power of band - structure engineering and epitaxial heterostructures .",
    "the spin of a bound electron in a donor atom is used as the qubit .",
    "the qubit can be selectively tuned in and out of resonance under gate - control to realize single - qubit operation , by taking advantage of g - factor variations available in sige heterolayers .",
    "larger surface gate biases could be employed to couple neighboring qubits in a controllable way by displacing the bound electrons deep into ge - rich layers .",
    "however , this scheme suffers from the complexity of g - factor engineering and possible qubit loss due to ionization when the bound electron is dragged into the high - g region .    in this paper",
    "we study another modified version of kane - type architecture proposed in ref . [ 7 ] .",
    "we follow the encoding scheme by divincenzo et .",
    "al . [ 8 ] , where universal quantum computation can be realized for composite 3-spin qubits , with only nearest - neighbor heisenberg exchange interaction .",
    "a logic qubit , encoded by the subspace of three neighboring phosphorous donor electron spins , is shown in fig .",
    "logic zero is represented by spins 1 and 2 in the singlet state s , and spin 3 up .",
    "logic one is a linear combination of triplet states @xmath3 and @xmath4 for spins 1 and 2 , with spin 3 down and up , respectively , to preserve the overall spin quantum numbers .",
    "initializing to logic zero is achieved by cooling the system in a large magnetic field to polarize spin 3 , while inducing an even greater exchange coupling @xmath5 , between spins 1 and 2 to produce the equilibrium spin singlet .",
    "typical parameters for @xmath6 initialization error at t=100 mk are @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "there are two kinds of top gates to control qubit operations , shown in fig .",
    "1 , similar to the a - gates and j - gates in kane s proposal .",
    "one - qubit operations are implemented with the nearest - neighbor exchange in four or fewer steps , eliminating the need for gated esr rotations .",
    "the two - qubit cnot operation can also be performed by the nearest - neighbor exchange within a 1d array , in 19 steps[8 ] .",
    "readout can be performed with a single electron transistor(set ) incorporated close to individual qubit , by utilizing spin - charge transduction[9 ] .    in our design ( fig .  1 ) , phosphorous donors are placed at substitutional sites on a plane inside the @xmath9 quantum well(qw ) .",
    "we use the composition @xmath10 for sige , which yields approximately a quantum well band offset of @xmath11 with respect to the barriers . the strained silicon qw not only prevents ionization of the donors during gate operation , but also reduces the valley degeneracy of the donor ground state . the @xmath12 layer right below the top metallic gates , is introduced to produce the desired gate potential and exchange coupling .",
    "the planar set shown in fig .",
    "1 can be patterned into the p @xmath13-layer by stm along with the individual p donor qubits , in the same lithographic step .",
    "our device presented in fig.1 is somehow similar to that of friesen et .",
    "al.[4 ] , where one uses a si / sige quantum well to confine electrons vertically and use top gates to confine electrons laterally .",
    "electron spins in such `` quantum dots '' act as qubits , with top gate voltages tuning the exchange coupling between qubits .",
    "however , the use of phosphorous donor electrons in our device provides a much smaller qubit size and a more densely integrated qc as we scale up the number of qubits .",
    "furthermore , as we shall see in this paper , the available strong gate - assisted exchange coupling allows a much faster gate operation than that in the friesen et .",
    "proposal , which would enable faster computation and more easily satisfy the condition for gate operation duration v.s .",
    "qubit decoherence time required by quantum error correction principle . by using naturally bound donor electrons as qubits",
    ", we avoid additional top gates used to provide lateral confinement and the problem of precisely controlling the number of electrons in each quantum dot .",
    "the issue of decoherence of qubits is of critical importance for the construction of a realistic qc .",
    "the quantum error correction principle has set severe limits on the amount of tolerable decoherence for feasible qc operations .",
    "more than @xmath14 reliable quantum gate operations need to be performed during the coherence time , while the fidelity of gate operation could be lost for too short a gate duration . the spin decoherence in si :",
    "p system has been intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically in recent years[10,11,12,13,14 ] . due to the weakness of electron - phonon and spin - orbital interaction ,",
    "the longitudinal spin relaxation time @xmath15 at low temperature can be as long as @xmath16 seconds[15 ] , while the transverse spin dephasing time @xmath17 is of the order of 60 ms at 7k for isotopically purified @xmath18si : p , as detected by spin echo technique[11 ] .",
    "theoretically it is expected that @xmath17 can be as long as @xmath19 in isotopically purified @xmath18si .",
    "this extraordinarily long decoherence time is another attractive aspect of spin - based si : p qc architectures .    due to the attractive features of the si : p qc ,",
    "recently there have been much increased research activities on si : p donors , such as the re - estimate of spin decoherence time[10 - 14 ] , the stark effect and gate - induced ionization of single donor[16 - 18 ] , and most importantly , the exchange coupling for a donor pair[19 - 24 ] .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the shallow donor problem in si , incorporating the details of the si band structure .",
    "we present the necessary formalism for the multi - valley effective mass equation for single donor and the unrestricted hatree - fock approach with generalized valence bond(gvb ) wave functions for coupled donor pair .",
    "we study in section iii the energy level splitting and charge distribution for a quantum - well - confined single donor .",
    "section iv presents the most important results of our work .",
    "the exchange coupling for a donor pair is extensively studied , including the effect of quantum well size , the oscillatory behavior v. s. donor position shift , and gate voltage dependence .",
    "the calculation of the realistic gate potential is presented in the appendix by solving the poisson equation with appropriate boundary conditions . in the last section",
    "we summarize our work and present relevant remarks on the si : p based qc architecture .",
    "the problem of impurities in semiconductors was extensively studied in the sixties and seventies of last century , along with the growth of the semiconductor industry [ 25 ] . the most common and successful approach",
    "to solve the single impurity problem is to utilize the effective mass approximation ( ema ) [ 26 ] . for semiconductors like silicon",
    ", there are several equivalent valleys in the conduction band due to crystal symmetry , and the original hydrogenic ema needs to be modified to incorporate the interactions between degenerate valleys known as  valley - orbit coupling  . the main contribution to",
    "the valley - orbit coupling arises from the short - range core part of the impurity potential .",
    "the impurity potential is usually not coulombic near the core , and it is difficult to calculate it from first principles due to the complication of exchange and correlation effects between the donor electron and core electrons .",
    "therefore , in the early applications of ema , the agreement between theories and experiments is good for excited states but poor for ground states which have a high probability inside the core .",
    "later on many theoretical attempts [ 27 ] were made to account for the discrepancies between the hydrogenic binding energies @xmath20 and the observed donor binding energy , @xmath21 .",
    "this difference , mainly due to the greatly reduced of screening of coulomb potential inside the so - called `` central - cell '' region , is commonly referred to as the `` chemical shift '' or `` central - cell correction '' .    experimentally [ 28 ] , for phosphorous donors in bulk silicon , the zero - field binding energies are @xmath22 ( the nondegenerate ground state with a symmetry ) , @xmath23 ( two - fold degenerate state with e symmetry ) , and @xmath24 ( three - fold degenerate state with @xmath17 symmetry)v . here",
    "@xmath25 is the binding energy of six - fold degenerate ground states obtained by single - valley ema .",
    "kohn and luttinger s theory [ 26 ] yield @xmath26 , while the more elaborate work by faulkner [ 29 ] gives @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , known as central - cell corrections , are positive , and in contrast to @xmath25 , depend on the particular impurity species . for si :",
    "p donors , @xmath31 according to kohn and luttinger ( or 14.3 mev according to faulkner ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is pointed out by pantelides and sah [ 30 ] that the concept of chemical shifts or central - cell corrections are ill - defined in the one - valley ema framework , except for isocoric impurities ( where impurity and host have the same number of core electrons , e.g. , si : p donor ) , and the `` chemical shift '' must arise almost entirely from intervalley mixing , which causes the splitting of the six - fold degenerate ground state level of donors embedded in silicon as observed experimentally .",
    "therefore , a multi - valley effective mass equation ( mveme ) is needed to correctly solve the impurity problem in a host with multi - valley conduction band .",
    "the first effective - mass equation for a multi - valley band was obtained by twose as reported by fritzsche [ 31 ] . for a single substitutional donor situated at @xmath34 in silicon ,",
    "whose band structure has six equivalent valleys , the electron wave function in real space can be written as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the periodic part of the bloch functions for silicon lattice .",
    "@xmath37 is the envelope function for the i - th valley , with @xmath38 corresponding to six valleys centered at the band minima @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "@xmath42 , with @xmath43 the lattice constant for silicon crystal .",
    "the twose s multi - valley effective mass equation(mveme ) reads : @xmath44 f_i({\\bf r } ) = 0\\ ] ] where the set of coefficients @xmath45 is determined by crystal symmetry group .",
    "@xmath46 is the impurity potential and @xmath47 is the expansion of the silicon band structure @xmath48 at the i - th minimum .",
    "for example , around the minimum along @xmath49 direction , located at @xmath50 , the energy may be expanded as @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the longitudinal and transverse effective masses , respectively .",
    "the mveme [ eq .  ( 2 ) ] is essentially a set of coupled equations for the envelope functions associated with different valleys .",
    "if the inter - valley mixing , also called valley - orbital interaction , is negligibly small , the envelope functions for different valley nearly coincide and the set of mveme equations reduce to one single - valley eme .",
    "that s the origin of the six - fold degenerate ground state for donors in silicon obtained by kohn and luttinger [ 26 ] . only by taking into account the coupling between different valleys we can obtain correct splitting of the ground state . for a substitutional donor in silicon , the impurity potential has tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "valley - orbit coupling mixes the six bloch functions belonging to different valleys with three kinds of symmetries according to the irreducible representations of the @xmath54 group .",
    "the linear combinations of them form a singlet with @xmath55 symmetry , a doublet with @xmath56 symmetry , and a triplet with @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "the appropriate linear combinations are @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 here @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63,@xmath64 and @xmath65 are the labels for the six bloch functions , according to the directions of conduction band minima .",
    "( 2 ) can be solved once we know the form of the impurity potential @xmath46 . for substitutional donors , such as phosphorous donors in silicon , the impurity potential , @xmath46 ,",
    "consists of two parts : @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath66 is essentially the difference between the potential of an impurity ion and a host ion , and @xmath67 arises from the redistribution of valence electrons in the crystal , caused by the presence of @xmath66 . for phosphorous donors in silicon ,",
    "the point - charge model is reliable and linear response theory can be validly applied to solve the impurity potential[27,30 ] .",
    "the resulting impurity potential in k space can be written as    @xmath68    with @xmath69 given by the fourier transform of @xmath70 where the first term is the coulomb potential of one point charge and @xmath71 denotes the short - range contribution .",
    "the q - dependent dielectric screening function , instead of simply the constant @xmath72 in the hydrogenic impurity potential , is used to take care of the correct screening effect both near and far away from the core .",
    "a set of exponential functions may be used to simulate the dielectric screening function[30 ] .    for si :",
    "p donors , @xmath73 is very small and localized within about one lattice constant .",
    "similar to the short - range behavior of the dielectric screening function , it s difficult to calculate .",
    "therefore we include all of the short range effects in the modelled dielectric screening function . for convenience",
    "we will approximate the dielectric screening effect by a set of isotropic gaussian functions .",
    "it is found that , a single - parameter gaussian function is adequate for simulating the ( inverse of ) dielectric screening function calculated in ref . [ 32 ] within several lattice constants ( @xmath43 ) and yield the correct long - range limit .",
    "explicitly , the dielectric function used in this paper has the following form : @xmath74\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is treated as an empirical parameter .",
    "we find that @xmath76 gives reasonable agreement with the dielectric function in the range of more than two lattice constants and it yields the correct intervalley splitting of the si : p ground state .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 7 ) constitute all we need to adequately describe the electron wave function and energy levels for an isolated si : p donor . for our specific qc architecture ,",
    "phosphorous donors are confined in a si / sige quantum well .",
    "the large in - plane strain presented in the quantum well further reduces the crystal symmetry . as discussed in refs .",
    "[ 21 ] and [ 33 ] within perturbation theory , the interplay of strain and valley - orbit effect makes only two valleys relevant for the low - lying states . for the quantum",
    "well shown in fig .",
    "1 , the minimums of two lowest energy valleys are at @xmath77 and @xmath78 . their energies are well separated from those at the minimums of the other four higher energy valleys by more than 100 mev . thus",
    ", only the + z and -z valleys contribute to the ground state .",
    "explicitly , we are left with two kinds of linear combinations of bloch wave functions , @xmath79 @xmath80 the symmetric @xmath81 state is the ground state for a single donor at the center of a strained quantum well .",
    "analogous to eq .",
    "( 1 ) , for a single donor located at @xmath82 , the two - valley wave function can be written as @xmath83    the corresponding two - valley effective mass equation with external field is given by @xmath84 f_{+z}({\\bf r})+\\]]@xmath85 f_{-z}({\\bf r})=0\\]]@xmath86 f_{+z}({\\bf r})\\]]@xmath87 f_{-z}({\\bf r})= 0\\ ] ] where @xmath88 has an operator form as follows : @xmath89    the envelope functions for the two valleys , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , are coupled together , as shown in eq .",
    ". we do not assume the equivalence of @xmath90 and @xmath91 as , e.g. , in refs .",
    "[ 4 ] and [ 21 ] , since we shall consider the situation where the system lacks reflection symmetry about @xmath92 .    to solve the electron wave functions and energies , we need to choose some well - behaved basis functions to expand the two envelope functions .",
    "we modify the set of bases used in our previous paper[20 ] ( in which we study si : p donors within spherically averaged ema ) to take into account the anisotropy of the silicon band structure and the broken symmetry brought by the external field .",
    "we use a set of two - dimensional(2d ) anisotropic gaussian functions @xmath93 to describe the freedoms in y and z directions .",
    "two different kinds of gaussian functions,@xmath94 ; i=1, ...",

    "the optimum value for the anisotropy factor @xmath96 is obtained by minimizing the ground state energy .",
    "we note that both even and odd symmetric bases are necessary when the external potential lacks reflection symmetry with respect to the doping plane(z=0 ) .",

    "are arranged along the [ 100 ] axis , and neighboring qubits can be coupled together mainly by the wave - function overlaps along the x axis . to facilitate our calculation and to better describe the inter - donor coupling",
    ", we place the system in an artificial 1d box with infinite potential barriers .",
    "the center of the box is at @xmath101 and the box size @xmath102 is chosen to be large enough ( at least 10 nm from the donor ion to either side wall ) so that it has negligible effect on the donor binding energy and charge distribution . with the introduction of the box , we can use a set of orthogonal sine functions , @xmath103 , m=1, ...",

    "again , such a set of functions includes both odd ( even m ) and even ( odd m ) functions of @xmath104 .",
    "this is needed when the donor ion is shifted from the box center ( which is the case when more than one donor are present ) and/or a nonsymmetric external potential is introduced . combining the set of sine functions and @xmath105",

    "the suitability of this construction of bases was discussed and verified in a previous publication [ 20 ] by comparing our numerical results to exact results in various limits .",
    "now we can expand the two valley - dependent envelope functions as a linear combination of our bases .",
    "we write : @xmath109 + @xmath110    substituting eqn .",

    "obviously , @xmath123 , since @xmath124 is hermitian .",

    "( 16 ) by 1 .    our main equation , eq .",
    "( 14 ) , is a generalized eigenvalue equation composed of a @xmath136 hamiltonian matrix h and a @xmath136 overlap matrix .",
    "since the sine functions in @xmath104 are already orthogonal , we only need to perform the gram - schmidt orthogonalization process on the set of @xmath137 dependent gaussian functions to convert the generalized eigenvalue equation into a standard eigenvalue equation .",
    "we have @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a @xmath115 hermitian matrix and @xmath140 denote a 2n - dimensional eigenvector .",
    "the full single donor electron wave function can be constructed from @xmath140 according to eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and  ( 13 ) , once the bloch functions @xmath141 are known .    to study a donor pair coupled by mutual coulomb interaction , we need to build the appropriate form of the two - electron wave function and the effective two - electron hamiltonian(born - oppenheimer approximation",
    "is implicitly assumed ) .",
    "like the potential term in the one - electron mveme , the electron - electron(e - e ) interaction term should also include contributions from different valleys .",

    "as we discussed and examined in our previous paper [ 20 ] , the above method dealing with a two - particle problem , which we call uhf with generalized valence bond wave functions , does a better job than the usual single - determinant hf method , or the hl approximation .",
    "the floating - phase heitler - london approach , proposed by koiller et .",

    "compared to the configuration interaction(ci ) method , which uses a set of two - particle wave function bases(each basis corresponding to a slater determinant ) to do an exact diagonization , our proposed method uses 2 relaxed determinants to expand the wave function .",
    "however , we adopt our method instead of the ci method because it can handle the well - separated two - donor problem adequately and requires much less computational resources , while the large number of bases needed in the ci method makes it currently unpractical .    for convenience we define the effective bohr radius @xmath159 and the effective rydberg ( donor binding energy ) @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the free electron mass , @xmath162 is the spherically averaged effective mass , @xmath163 with @xmath164 and @xmath165 for silicon .    throughout the paper ,",

    "we can reach a j - coupling of approximately @xmath230 .    however , as discussed in ref . [",

    "each plot shows a two - peak structure with peaks near the donor nuclei . except for fig .",
    "8(a ) and ( d ) where the coupling and overlap is weak and the charge distributions for singlet and triplet almost coincide , singlet state has a larger probability than the corresponding triplet state in the central region between donors , due to the pauli exclusion principle[20 ] . in fig .",
    "9(a ) , although the gate - off exchange coupling is nearly equal to that at @xmath231 and @xmath232 , their charge distributions are different .",
    "for the gate - off case , the two charge distribution peaks are symmetrically centered at the donor sites , while for the case of @xmath231 and @xmath232 , they are more spread out and become nonsymmetric with respect to the donor locations .",

    "for the case of @xmath233 shown in fig .",
    "8(b ) , the singlet is only slightly different from the triplet , with slightly larger ( smaller ) weight in the central ( donor site ) region , and the peak centers remain close to the donor locations as in the case of configurations of ( a ) , although they are pulled toward each other to give an enhanced overlap . in fig .",
    "8(c ) , when the ( attractive ) gate potential becomes even stronger , the difference between singlet and triplet charge distributions becomes more significant , and the weights in the central region are comparable to those in the donor regions . for this case ,",

    "obviously , larger donor separation corresponds to large gate tunability on exchange coupling .",
    "however , as we will see below , larger gate tunability also leads to more stringent requirement for voltage control accuracy .    with a time - dependent voltage pulse",

    "the parameters in the 3 gaussians , are adjusted to take care of the central cell correction so that correct valley splitting is reproduced for the single donor ground state .",
    "the 1d box width is set to be @xmath276 , to further reduce possible artificial effects of box boundaries .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "10 the exchange splitting for donor separation varied from 70 to 90 @xmath187 ( or 190 to 244 @xmath277 ) .",
    "the figure is plotted in logarithmic scale , as the exchange splitting has an exponential dependence on donor separation .",
    "the dotted line is an exponential fitting curve .",
    "we find that the fitting works fairly well . compared to the exchange oscillation in fig .",
    "9(a ) , the exchange splitting is almost monotonically increasing as the donor separation is reduced . only for separation larger than @xmath278 ,",
    "exchange splitting is no longer monotonic and residual oscillation is present .",
    "this behavior can be qualitatively understood in the following way .",
    "the valley - interference induced exchange oscillation is analogous to noise , which is prominent when the exchange coupling ( analogous to signal ) is weak .",
    "the exponential dependence of exchange splitting on donor separation , tends to suppress the oscillation for small enough separation ( strong enough exchange coupling ) .",
    "if we take the exponential fitting curve as a reference , the deviation oscillates strongly from both sides of the reference curve at large separation and decays as separation is decreased .",
    "based on our calculation , it is worth to make a few remarks on the importance of precise donor positioning to fault tolerant quantum computation .",
    "first , the deviation of donors from any host atom site is highly undesirable , since the electronic properties of an interstitial donor is remarkably different from a substitutional donor .",
    "second , a recent report shows that the stm - based lithographic technology can position single p atoms into si with @xmath279 nm accuracy[44 ] .",
    "if unfortunately , a donor atom is shifted away from the desired site , it will result in large computation error ( due to the deviation of exchange coupling from desired value ) and qubit measurement error ( due to the qubit leakage to undesired subspace ) .",
    "however , this should be able to be detected in the calibration process described in ref .",
    "[ 7 ] , and we can either adjust the gate voltage to reduce error or reject the erroneous qubit .",
    "in this paper we have presented a systematic study on coupled phosphorous donors in a strained silicon quantum well , relevant for silicon - based quantum computer design . following the multi - valley effective mass approach ,",
    "we have developed a two - valley equation for the single donor . by turning the valley - coupled sch@xmath280dinger equation into a single matrix eigenvalue problem , we are able to solve the donor electron ground state energies and wave functions .",
    "the central cell correction is consistently incorporated by our model potential , yielding the correct valley splitting .",
    "we have studied the effects of quantum - well confinement and donor position shift on the valley splitting and charge distribution for the single donor ground state .",
    "we find that , as the quantum well is narrowed , the electron wave function shrinks and larger valley splitting is obtained . for a qw at fixed width , the valley splitting also increases as the donor approaches the edge of the qw .",
    "we have examined the effects of qw width and donor position variations at the atomic scale .",
    "the oscillation of valley splitting for donor electron ground state is observed for both cases .",
    "the valley splitting of the lowest qw states is also calculated as a function of qw width and oscillation behavior is confirmed .",
    "we have analyzed these results and compared them to relevant papers by other authors .    the unrestricted hartree - fock method with gvb wave functions is formulated and applied to a pair of coupled donors , without losing the delicate nature of single - particle wave functions .",
    "the advantages of this method over other approaches are discussed .",
    "accurate wave functions and energies of the lowest singlet and triplet states can be obtained .",
    "the heisenberg exchange coupling is calculated at different qw widths and we find that a wider quantum well gives rise to larger exchange splitting .",
    "the qw width of 10 nm is appropriate for our proposed qc design .",
    "we have calculated the gate potential profile numerically by solving poisson equation with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the effect of gate voltages on exchange coupling between neighboring donors is analyzed , for several donor separations .",
    "we find the appropriate separation and voltage zones suitable for qubit initialization and gate operation .",
    "a gate tunability is defined to characterize the efficiency of gates to alter the exchange coupling . with a linear time - dependent voltage pulse shape ,",
    "we have evaluated the appropriate gate operation time of 0.2 ns for a @xmath1 operation , considering both the requirements of fault tolerant quantum computation and adiabatic operation .",
    "an analytic formulae for the lower bound of the gate operation fidelity is obtained , by relating it to the gate tunability and voltage control accuracy . for a typical gate tunability , and to realize fault tolerant quantum computation , a voltage control accuracy of @xmath272 is necessary .",
    "the valley degeneracy of the si : p donor electron ground state could lead to oscillation of the exchange coupling as donor positions are shifted . with our approach to the two - electron problem",
    ", we have calculated the exchange coupling as a function of donor position shift perpendicular to qw plane .",
    "oscillation is observed when gate potential is switched off , and switching - on of gate potential can suppress the exchange oscillation .",
    "the exchange coupling as a function of donor position shift along donor coupling axis is also calculated .",
    "we find that the exchange oscillation is greatly suppressed at small donor separation and residual oscillation can be observed at large separation .",
    "the oscillation behaviors can be explained by analogy to the signal - to - noise ratio .    in conclusion , we have studied in a systematic way the ground state of single si : p donors and the exchange coupling of a coupled donor pair placed in a strained silicon quantum well .",
    "our calculation is of importance in evaluating the prospects and providing practical guidance for a p - donor silicon - based quantum computer .",
