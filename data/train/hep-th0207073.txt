    "the imposition of boundary conditions on a quantum field leads to the modification of the spectrum for the zero  point fluctuations and results in the shift in the vacuum expectation values for physical quantities such as the energy density and stresses .",
    "in particular , vacuum forces arise acting on constraining boundaries .",
    "this is the familiar casimir effect .",
    "the particular features of the resulting vacuum forces depend on the nature of the quantum field , the type of spacetime manifold and its dimensionality , the boundary geometries and the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field .",
    "since the original work by casimir in 1948 @xcite many theoretical and experimental works have been done on this problem , including various types of boundary geometry and non - zero temperature effects ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "many different approaches have been used : mode summation method with combination of the zeta function regularization technique , green function formalism , multiple scattering expansions , heat - kernel series , etc .",
    "an interesting topic in the investigations of the casimir effect is the dependence of the vacuum characteristics on the type of the vacuum .",
    "it is well known that the uniqueness of vacuum state is lost when we work within the framework of quantum field theory in a general curved spacetime or in non  inertial frames . in particular , the use of general coordinate transformation in quantum field theory in flat spacetime leads to an infinite number of unitary inequivalent representations of the commutation relations .",
    "different inequivalent representations will in general give rise to different pictures with different physical implications , in particular to different vacuum states .",
    "for instance , the vacuum state for an uniformly accelerated observer , the fulling ",
    "rindler vacuum @xcite , turns out to be inequivalent to that for an inertial observer , the familiar minkowski vacuum .",
    "quantum field theory in accelerated systems contains many of special features produced by a gravitational field avoiding some of the difficulties entailed by renormalization in a curved spacetime .",
    "in particular , near the canonical horizon in the gravitational field , a static spacetime may be regarded as a rindler  like spacetime .",

    "@xcite , there is a class of solutions to the einstein equations with a plane ",
    "symmetric matter distribution for which the corresponding external geometry is described by the rindler metric ( rindler walls ) .",
    "another motivation for the investigation of quantum effects in the rindler space is related to the fact that this space is conformally related to the de sitter space and to the robertson  walker space with negative spatial curvature .",
    "as a result the expectation values of the energy  momentum tensor for a conformally invariant field and for corresponding conformally transformed boundaries on the de sitter and robertson  walker backgrounds can be derived from the corresponding rindler counterpart by the standard transformation ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the vacuum expectation values of the energy ",
    "momentum tensors for a scalar and electromagnetic fields in the region between two parallel plates moving by constant proper acceleration through the fulling  rindler vacuum .",
