    "during the last few years , a considerable amount of new information on charmless hadronic decays of @xmath7 mesons has been reported , primarily by the cleo collaboration .",
    "the discoveries of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 decay modes  @xcite have provided a real basis for searches for direct cp - violating effects in the @xmath7 meson system .    however ,",
    "because of large combinatoric backgrounds , studies of charmless @xmath7 decays have concentrated mainly on two - body decay processes .",
    "three - body decays could significantly broaden the study of @xmath7 meson decay mechanisms and provide additional possibilities for direct cp violation searches . in this paper , we report the results of a study of charged @xmath7 meson decays to three charged particle final states @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , where no assumptions are made about intermediate hadronic resonances .",

    "the inclusion of charge conjugate states is implicit throughout this work .",
    "the data sample used for this analysis was collected with the belle detector operating at the kekb asymmetric energy @xmath17 collider  @xcite .",
    "it consists of 29.1  fb@xmath2 taken at the @xmath18 resonance , corresponding to @xmath19 produced @xmath20 pairs , and 2.3  fb@xmath2 taken 40  mev below the @xmath20 production threshold to perform systematic studies of the @xmath21 background .",
    "the belle detector  @xcite is a large - solid - angle spectrometer based on a 1.5  t superconducting solenoid magnet .",
    "charged particle tracking is provided by a three layer double - sided silicon vertex detector ( svd ) and a 50 layer cylindrical drift chamber ( cdc ) that surround the interaction region .",

    "only the acc and @xmath28 are used for separation of charged pions and kaons since here the tof provides no additional discrimination .",

    "we use a monte carlo simulation to model the response of the detector and determine acceptance  @xcite .",
    "charged tracks are required to satisfy a set of track quality requirements based on the average hit residual and on the distances of closest approach to the interaction point in the plane perpendicular to the beam and the plane containing the beam and the track .",
    "we also require that the transverse track momenta be greater than 0.1  gev/@xmath27 to reduce the low momentum combinatoric background .",
    "charged kaon candidate tracks are selected with a set of pid criteria that has about 90% efficiency , a charged pion misidentification probability of about 8% , and a negligible contamination from protons .",

    "we find qualitative agreement between the experimental dalitz plot distribution of the signal events and that obtained from the monte carlo simulation with this simple model .",
    "then we extract the signal yield for the two - body final states : @xmath193 and the so - called @xmath143 , which is , in fact , all of the remaining signal .",
    "we follow the same procedure as we used for the @xmath15 final state .",
    "the signal yields are determined from a simultaneous fit to the @xmath44 distributions for four separate regions of the @xmath16 dalitz plot .",
    "the results of the fit are summarized in table  [ kkk_min ] .",
    "we determine the model - dependent error in the same way as we did for the @xmath15 final state . in the case of the @xmath16 final state the model - dependent error is found to be much smaller than in the @xmath15 final state .",
    "this is mainly due to the small width of the @xmath134 meson .",
    "the high quality of @xmath103 separation at belle allows us to measure , for the first time , the branching ratios for the three - body modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 without assumptions about particular intermediate mechanisms .",
    "cleo  @xcite and babar  @xcite have previously placed upper limits on the branching fractions of non - resonant three - body decays : @xmath194 ( cleo ) , @xmath195 ( babar ) , @xmath196 ( cleo ) .",
    "a comparison of the applied selection criteria shows that cleo and babar restricted their analyses to the region of invariant mass above 2  gev/@xmath40 for any pair of the particles .",
    "this requirement effectively removes most of the low mass resonances that provide the dominant contribution to our observed signal .",
    "they assume a uniform distribution of events over the dalitz plot to obtain the limits quoted above .",
    "the upper limits reported here for the @xmath152 , @xmath148 and @xmath150 modes are considerably more restrictive than previous limits from cleo  @xcite and opal  @xcite .",
    "significant signals are observed for the first time in the decay modes @xmath197 and @xmath8 .",
    "the measured branching fraction product for the @xmath198 final state is @xmath6 .",
    "this is the first observation of a @xmath7 decay to a charmless scalar - pseudoscalar final state .",
    "the measured branching fraction product for the @xmath176 final state is @xmath199 . using the value of @xmath200 , we translate our measurement into the branching fraction @xmath9",
    ". the significant enhancement in the @xmath107 invariant mass spectrum above the @xmath201 mass agrees with the scalar @xmath202 hypothesis .",
    "this is also in agreement with theoretical predictions  @xcite for the @xmath203 branching fraction based on the factorization model .",
    "nevertheless , we can not exclude some contribution from the tensor @xmath204 state .",
    "the interpretation of the peak with a @xmath108 invariant mass around 1300 mev/@xmath40 in the @xmath15 system is less certain .",
    "there are two known candidate states : the @xmath205 and @xmath175  @xcite . attributing the peak to the @xmath175 , with its rather small coupling to @xmath108  @xcite , would lead to an unusually large branching fraction for a charmless @xmath7 decay mode . on the other hand ,",
    "as recently shown in  @xcite , the factorization model predicts a very small branching fraction for the @xmath206 .",
    "if our observation is , in fact , due to the @xmath205 , this would provide evidence for a significant nonfactorizable contribution .",
    "we can not identify the broad structure observed in the @xmath122 final state above the @xmath134 meson .",
    "it is hardly compatible with the presence of a single scalar state , either @xmath175 or @xmath207  @xcite .",
    "we also can not exclude the presence of a non - resonant contribution or the case of several resonances contributing to the excess in the @xmath124 invariant mass spectrum seen around 1.5 gev/@xmath40 .",
    "we find that effects of interference between different two - body intermediate states can have significant influence on the observed two - particle mass spectra and a full amplitude analysis of three - body @xmath7 meson decays is required for a more complete understanding .",
    "this will be possible with increased statistics .",
