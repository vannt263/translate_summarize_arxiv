    "the predicted frequency distribution can then be compared with the distribution as measured in an experiment with the same values of @xmath7 and @xmath12 . from the comparison",

    "congruence of both curves indicates that the experimental data obey an equidistribution ( case ( 2 ) ) or the specified distribution ( case ( 3 ) ) , respectively .",
    "it may occur that the curve of the rank ordered experimental data decays significantly slower than the corresponding theoretical curve due to eq . .",

    "these so - called polymorphisms or variants may occur either in regions of the genome which are coding for amino acid sequences or in non - coding segments .",
    "those changes of the dna sequence that alter the amino acid sequence are frequently associated with diseases because the respective proteins can not operate properly .",
    "screenings for mutations using dna of patients have been performed for many human diseases and the identified mutations are accessible in mutation databases @xcite .",
    "the detection of so - called mutation hot spots , i.e. sequence regions with many mutation positions , is important for the identification of the functional and genetical properties of the genetic code @xcite .",
    "these hot spots must be distinguished from statistical fluctuations that occur even when the probabilities for mutations are identical for each residue position .",
