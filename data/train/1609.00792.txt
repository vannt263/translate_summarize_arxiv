    "15p / finlay ( hereafter 15p ) was an undistinguished comet discovered by william henry finlay at cape of good hope , south africa , on 1886 september 26 .",
    "this comet has a semi - major axis of @xmath9 = 3.488 au , eccentricity of @xmath10 = 0.720 , inclination of @xmath11 = 6.80 , and tisserand parameter with respect to jupiter of @xmath12 = 2.62 , which are typical of jupiter - family comets ( jfcs ) .",
    "since the discovery , it showed irregular magnitude light curves at different apparitions @xcite .",
    "the effective radius of 15p is estimated to be 0.92 @xmath1 0.05 km @xcite , which is consistent with early results in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it has maintained the perihelion around the earth orbit at 0.981.10 au for about a century and is sometimes linked to a meteor shower @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the measured absolute magnitude reduced by a factor of @xmath810 from 7.5 mag in 1886 to 10.1 mag in 1981 @xcite , suggesting that 15p might have lost a fraction of volatile components near the surface while developing a dust mantle layer on the surface similar to other periodic comets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the comet exhibited two large - scale outbursts around the perihelion passage in 20142015 , with the first outburst occurring on 2014 december 16 @xcite .",
    "the image showed an envelope feature and near  nuclear tail , which is reminiscent of past cometary outbursts at 17p / holmes and 332p/2010 v1 ( ikeya  murakami ) , hereafter referred to as 17p and 332p , respectively @xcite .",
    "soon after the report of the first outburst , we conducted an observation from 2014 december 23 to 2015 march 16 for deepening our understanding of cometary outbursts .",
    "we used six ground - based telescopes that constitute a portion of the optical and infrared synergetic telescopes for education and research ( oister ) inter - university observation network . as a result of frequent observation several times a week",
    ", we witnessed the second outburst on ut 2015 january 15 .",
    "such cometary outbursts have drawn the attention of researchers because they offer insight into the physical properties of comet nuclei @xcite .",
    "the huge outburst of 17p could be explained by the crystallization of buried amorphous ice @xcite .",
    "although similar morphological features were found at 332p @xcite , numerous of fragments were identified at its return in 2016 @xcite .",
    "motivated by a series of detections regarding cometary outbursts , we investigated the physical properties of the 15p multiple outbursts and estimated the frequency and mass production rate of outbursts on a scale similar to 15p .",
    "we describe our observations and data analysis in section 2 , and the photometric and polarimetric results in section 3 .",
    "we then discuss our findings considering the reports of recent outbursts in section 4 .",
    "the observational journal is summarized in table 1 .",
    "imaging observations were conducted from ut 2014 december 23 to ut 2015 march 16 using four telescopes : the okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) 0.5-m reflecting robotic telescope ( oao 0.5 m ) and 1.88-m telescope ( oao 1.88 m ) , the ishigakijima astronomical observatory ( iao ) murikabushi 1.05-m telescope ( iao 1.05 m ) , and the nishi  harima astronomical observatory ( nhao ) nayuta 2-m telescope ( nhao 2 m ) .",

    "the combinations of these telescopes and instruments cover 26@xmath1626  field - of - view ( fov ) with 1.53  pixel resolution at oao 0.5 m @xcite , 5.0@xmath16 4.4  fov with 0.33  pixel resolution at oao 1.88 m @xcite , 12@xmath16 12  fov with 0.72  pixel resolution at iao 1.05 m , and 11@xmath16 11fov with 0.32  pixel resolution at nhao 2 m. in addition , we made optical and near - infrared polarimetric observations during two nights on ut 2014 december 2427 by using the nayoro observatory 1.6 m pirka telescope of the faculty of science , the hokkaido university ( no 1.6 m ) and the higashi  hiroshima observatory ( hho ) kanata 1.5 m optical and near - infrared telescope of hiroshima astrophysical science center , hiroshima university ( hho 1.5 m ) .",
    "we used a visible multi - spectral imager ( msi ) with a polarimetric module and @xmath14band filter at no 1.6 m @xcite and hiroshima optical and near - infrared camera ( honir ) with @xmath14 and @xmath17-band filters for hho 1.5 m @xcite . in the imaging mode ,",

    "raw data were reduced by using flat field images taken with uniform screens on telescope domes and with dark or bias obtained before or after the comet exposures . for imaging data , we combined individual exposures into nightly composite images for each filter , excluding cosmic rays , background stars and galaxies by using the same technique as that of @xcite .",

    "we measured the instrumental magnitudes of all stars in the fov and compared them with the catalog magnitudes to determine the zero magnitudes of each @xmath14band image . for analysis of the polarimetric data",
    ", we followed the technique written in @xcite .",
    "because of a low signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) , we did not analyze near - infrared polarimetric data .",
    "raw data were preprocessed by using flat and dark frames in the same manner as that for the imaging data .",
    "we extracted source fluxes on ordinary and extraordinary parts of images by applying an aperture photometry technique .",
    "the obtained fluxes were used for deriving the stokes parameters normalized by the intensity , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . the linear polarization degree ( @xmath20 ) and the position angle of polarization ( @xmath21 ) were derived by the following equations @xcite :    @xmath22    and    @xmath23    we then derived the linear polarization degree commonly used for solar system objects ( @xmath24 ) and the position angle of the polarization plane ( @xmath25 ) referred to the scattering plane , which are given by    @xmath26    and    @xmath27    where @xmath28 denotes the position angle of the scattering plane projected on the sky .",
    "the sign in the parenthesis was chosen to meet the condition @xmath29 .",
    "the position angle of the polarized light from comets is generally perpendicular to the scattering plane at the solar phase angle ( sun  object ",
    "observer s angle ) @xmath3030 ; thus , as expected , @xmath25 was @xmath80 .",
    "figure [ fig : timeseries ] shows time - series false - color composite images at the @xmath14band .",
    "we chose these images because the @xmath14band is the most sensitive to cometary dust among the available filters .",
    "in fact , we examined the contribution of the spherical gas component by using the same technique as that described in section 3.1 of @xcite .",
    "we found that gas intensity took up only 10 @xmath1 2% ( within an aperture at @xmath31 km from the nucleus ) of @xmath14band total intensity on ut 2014 december 26 , which supports the weak gas flux contribution shown in figure [ fig : timeseries ] .",
    "some images taken in close time intervals are similar and are thus not shown separately . in the first image captured on ut 2014 december 23 ( figure [ fig : timeseries ] ( a ) ) , an envelope structure extends approximately toward the anti - solar direction .",
    "it is likely that the envelope is related to the first outburst around ut 2014 december 16 .",
    "the surface brightness of the envelope reduced quickly and became undetectable after around ut 2014 december 29 ( figure [ fig : timeseries ] ( c ) ) .",
    "after that time , a near nuclear dust coma and dust tail remained .",
    "the coma and tail are attributed to steady activity of the comet because both the shape and magnitude were almost constant over several months . a dramatic change",
    "was observed in images after ut 2015 january 16 .",
    "the inner coma brightened on ut 2015 january 16 ( figure [ fig : timeseries ] ( j ) ) , and dust ejecta appeared soon afterward were stretched toward the anti - solar direction ( figure [ fig : timeseries ] ( k)(n ) ) .",
    "the appearance of the dust cloud on ut 2015 january 23 ( figure [ fig : timeseries ] ( n ) ) , is similar to the image taken on ut 2014 december 23 ( figure [ fig : timeseries ] ( a ) ) , in which the comet was enclosed by a widely expanded envelope .",
    "the envelope dimmed quickly , leaving behind a near - nuclear dust cloud similar to that from the pre - second outburst . in summary , we observed at least two outburst ejecta superposed on the continuous activity of the comet during its perihelion passage .      to clarify the time variation of the activity in more quantitative manner , we conducted aperture photometry of the dust particles in the inner coma .",
    "we set a constant physical aperture distance from the nucleus at @xmath31 km and integrated the signal within @xmath32 by using the iraf / apphot package .",
    "the aperture distances correspond to 7.49.9  on the sky plane , which is large enough to enclose the seeing disk sizes of these data ( typically 23 ) but small enough to detect daily changes in dust production ( an ejection speed of @xmath8100 m s@xmath2 was assumed ) . in general , the measured magnitudes are determined not only by the time - variable activity of comets but also by the observing geometry ( i.e. , distances and viewing angles ) . to correct the latter effect , we converted the observed magnitudes into absolute values , which are magnitudes at a unit heliocentric distance @xmath33 = 1 au , observer s distance @xmath34= 1 au , and solar phase angle @xmath35 = 0 .",
    "these values were determined by    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the observed and absolute magnitudes in the @xmath14band . the third term in the right - hand side is given to correct the phase darkening , which is given by    @xmath39    where the constant @xmath40 was assumed to a generally quoted value for cometary dust particles , 0.035 mag deg@xmath2 @xcite . over our observation period ,",
    "the observed magnitudes were subtracted by 2.23.3 mag by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : abs - mag])([eq : phase - func ] ) to convert the absolute magnitudes .",
    "figure [ fig : mag ] shows the absolute magnitudes with respect to ( a ) the observed time and ( b ) the true anomaly @xmath41 ; by definition , the perihelion and aphelion occur at @xmath41 = 0  and 180 , respectively .",
    "the magnitude was almost constant or slightly decreased by 0.03 mag day@xmath2 until the day of second outburst .",
    "a minor eruption appears to have occurred on ut 2015 january 7 with a true anomaly of @xmath41 = 15.1 , brightening the comet by 0.46 @xmath1 0.14 mag . a careful review of the above time - sequence images revealed a sharp tail on ut 2015 january 711 , as shown in figure [ fig : timeseries ] ( f)(h ) .",
    "because it extended toward the position angle of 158.4 @xmath1 1.0 , which matches to anti - solar direction on that day ( 158.9 ) , we considered that a sudden ejection of fresh , small grains or ionized particles might have been stretched to the direction soon after the minor eruption on ut 2015 january 7 .",
    "a more outstanding brightening was observed on ut 2015 january 16 ( @xmath41 = 26.5 ) .",
    "the near - nuclear absolute magnitude was @xmath38 = 6.37 @xmath1 0.10 .",
    "after the brightening , the magnitudes remained smaller than the pre - outburst magnitudes over three days and returned to a normal magnitude within about one week .",
    "although the image on ut 2015 january 23 ( figure [ fig : timeseries ] ( n ) ) showed the widespread envelope , it is likely that a large part of the dust grains expanded beyond the aperture size of our photometry ( i.e. , @xmath42 km ) and became obscured by a steady stream of ejecta from the nucleus . to eliminate the magnitude excess on ut 2015 january 23",
    ", the outburst ejecta should have an ejection speed able to reach the aperture ( i.e. , @xmath42 km ) .",
    "we determined that a large fraction of outburst ejecta should have an effective speed of @xmath4315 m s@xmath2 to reach the aperture radius within one week .",
    "polarimetric observation was conducted to find the optical similarities and differences between normal cometary dust and the outburst ejecta .",
    "the polarimetric data were acquired about 10 days after the first outburst by using no 1.6 m and hho 1.5 m telescopes .",
    "@xmath14band filters were employed for our observations because this band is less contaminated by gaseous components and is sensitive to the solar - like dust spectrum , as we mentioned above ( section [ subsec : results ] ) .",
    "we integrated the signals of the observed data within apertures of @xmath32 = 8,000 km and 12,000 km , and derived the polarization degree ( @xmath24 ) and the position angle of the polarization vector ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath24 = 6.5 @xmath1 0.3% on ut 2014 december 26 and @xmath24 = 7.0 @xmath1 0.5% on ut 2014 december 27 .",
    "the position angle was aligned to the normal vector of the scattering plan , that is , @xmath21 = 1 @xmath1 4 .",
    "no significant difference was noted within the errors in @xmath24 between measurements with the large and small apertures ( i.e. , @xmath32 = 8,000 km and 12,000 km ) .",
    "figure [ fig : pol ] compares the polarimetric results with those of the other comets .",
    "the phase angle dependence of the polarization degree is known to be classified into two groups : dust - rich comets with high polarization degrees and gas - rich comets with low polarization degrees @xcite .",
    "o1 ( hale  bopp ) did not match these two categories and showed a very high polarization degree @xcite .",
    "the polarization degree of 15p fell into common values of comets between gas - rich and dust - rich groups .",
    "as described above , the surface brightness of the outburst ejecta faded out within @xmath8seven days from the near - nuclear region in the case of the second outburst , which is likely similar to the case of the first outburst , and was undistinguishable from the background dust particles produced by continuous activity .",
    "therefore , the similarity in polarization degree does not mean that the optical properties of outburst ejecta are the same as those in normal comets . as a result of the data analysis",
    ", we learned that earlier follow - up observations within @xmath8three days are required to determine the characteristics of such fresh particles during outbursts , such as fluffy or compact optical properties .",
    "this topic should be covered in future observation planning .      in this section ,",
    "we provide an approximate but straightforward estimate of outburst ejecta mass to compare with previous outbursts , and subsequently present a more sophisticated estimate by conducting dynamical analysis of dust particles in section [ subsec : dynamics ] .",
    "we measured the total @xmath14band magnitudes with apertures large enough to enclose the entire visible dust cloud for obtaining the total mass of the outburst materials .",
    "we set aperture radii of @xmath32 = 4.5  ( ut 2014 december 23 ) and 1  ( ut 2015 january 16 ) , and obtained @xmath37 = 9.44 @xmath1 0.10 ( ut 2014 december 23 ) and @xmath37 = 7.95 @xmath1 0.10 ( ut 2015 january 16 ) .",
    "the magnitude was @xmath37 = 11.12 @xmath1 0.12 on ut 2015 january 1113 , which was obtained just prior to the second outburst and well after the first outburst , when little outburst material was present as a result of radiation pressure sweeping . by using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : abs - mag])([eq : phase - func ] ) , we derived the absolute magnitudes of @xmath37(1,1,0 ) = 7.20 @xmath1 0.10 ( ut 2014 december 23 ) , 8.82 @xmath1 0.12 ( ut 2015 january 1113 ) , and 5.61 @xmath1 0.10 ( ut 2015 january 16 ) . with these magnitudes ,",
    "the optical cross - sections of the dust cloud ( @xmath44 ) were calculated by    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the geometric albedo ( @xmath46 = 0.04 was assumed ) , and @xmath47 = @xmath48 is the @xmath14band magnitude of the sun at @xmath33 = 1 au @xcite .    by substituting @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crosssection ] ) , we obtained @xmath44 = 3.32 @xmath16 10@xmath49 m@xmath50 ( ut 2014 december 23 ) , 7.47 @xmath16 10@xmath51 m@xmath50 ( ut 2015 january 1113 ) , and 1.44 @xmath16 10@xmath52 m@xmath50 ( ut 2015 january 16 ) .",
    "we attributed the cross - section on ut 2015 january 11 - 13 to dust grains ejected via continual activity , which is irrelevant to these outbursts .",
    "we subtracted this value from the other two values and obtained the cross - section associated with the first outburst , @xmath44 = 2.56 @xmath16 10@xmath49 m@xmath50 , and the second outburst @xmath44 = 1.36 @xmath16 10@xmath52 m@xmath50 .",
    "there is a possibility that we miss some fraction of the cross - section from the first outburst because our data might not cover its entire dust cloud on ut 2014 december 23 .",
    "we thus considered the total cross - section of the first outburst ejecta as the lower limit ( i.e. , @xmath44 @xmath53 2.56 @xmath16 10@xmath49 m@xmath50 for the first outburst ejecta ) .",
    "the ejecta masses of the outbursts can be given by @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the effective dust grain radius and mass density , respectively .",
    "the effective radius is given by    @xmath57    where @xmath58 denotes the power index of the size distribution in the range of @xmath59 .    with assumptions of @xmath56 = 1000 kg m@xmath60 and @xmath55 = 1 @xmath16 10@xmath61 m ( i.e. , 1 ) , @xmath44 gives @xmath62 @xmath7 3.41 @xmath6310@xmath64 kg for the first outburst and @xmath62 = 1.81 @xmath16 10@xmath4 kg for the second outburst .",
    "these values are equivalent to masses of @xmath65 20 m and 35 m bodies",
    ". it should be noted , however , that this simple assumption likely underestimated the dust mass .",
    "although the small particle ( @xmath55 = 1 ) assumption is occasionally quoted in previous research , abundant evidence exists for large particles from comets , which is subsequently discussed .",
    "thus , it is better to consider that the masses should be the lowest limits .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath44 = 7 @xmath16 10@xmath5 m@xmath50 for the first outburst and @xmath44 = 2 @xmath16 10@xmath49 m@xmath50 for the second outburst , which are smaller than our estimates .",
    "in addition , they reported @xmath62 = ( 23 ) @xmath16 10@xmath66 kg for the first outburst and @xmath62 = ( 45 ) @xmath16 10@xmath66 kg for the second outburst , which are more than two orders of magnitude less than our estimates .",
    "although we were unable to verify their results with the information available in their paper , we found that these orders - of - magnitude estimates reveal that the ejecta masses of 15p outbursts are equivalent to that of the 332p event ( 10@xmath410@xmath5 kg ) @xcite .",
    "we further investigated the images soon after the second outburst .",
    "figure [ fig : col2nd ] shows images taken after ut 2015 january 16.4 on the day in which brightening in figure [ fig : mag ] was detected .",
    "we do not show the image taken on ut 2015 january 18 because of its bad quality ( the total exposure time was only 3 min due to unstable weather ) . to clarify the movement of dust grains via solar radiation pressure , we rotated these images to match the sun ",
    "comet s direction to the horizontal direction .",
    "we produced color images assigning _",
    "g_@xmath13-band images ( the effective wavelength and the full width at half - maximum of @xmath67 = 483 nm and @xmath68 = 134 nm ) to blue ; @xmath14band images ( @xmath67 = 655 nm and @xmath68 = 121 nm ) to green ; and @xmath15band images ( @xmath69 = 799 nm and @xmath68 = 157 nm ) to red colors . in these images ,",
    "a whitish component expanded in space and simultaneously stretched toward the anti - solar direction . on the contrary hand , a bluish component expanded spherically with respect to the nuclear position . in general , prominent emissions associated with c@xmath70 and cn appear in the _ g_@xmath13 band , weak emissions with nh@xmath70 in the @xmath14band , and negligibly faint signals with nh@xmath70 and cn in the @xmath15band @xcite . in theory ,",
    "dust particles are accelerated by solar radiation pressure , whereas neutral gas molecules are less sensitive to the radiation pressure and expand almost spherically .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to consider that the whitish elongated structure originated from scattered sunlight from dust particles and that the bluish structure originated from cn and c@xmath70 emissions .",
    "we attempted to extract the signals from the second outburst and to discriminate the gas flux from the scattered light by dust grains .",
    "the observed angles rotated very little over 2015 january 1123 ( that is , 0.4  for the phase angle , 2.4  for the position angles of the anti - solar vector , and 1.4  for the position angle of negative orbital velocity ) .",
    "therefore , we subtracted the pre - outburst signals by using images observed on 2015 january 11 ( iao 1.05 m ) and 2015 january 13 ( oao 0.5 m ) from post - outburst images to adjust the apparent sizes of the comet based on the geocentric distances without rotating these images .",
    "next , assuming that @xmath15band images have little gas contamination , we subtracted them from _ g_@xmath13-band images by adjusting the @xmath15band intensity scales to minimize the extended dust structure ( i.e. dust tail ) in the residual images to produce gas intensity maps .",
    "specifically , we detected a very weak spherical component in the @xmath15band images that likely originated from weak cn emissions at 790820 nm , which were noticeable until ut 2015 january 17 but were unclear after january 19 .",
    "we subtracted the faint spherical component in the @xmath15band images by using the above gas intensity maps , scaling the gas intensities to obscure the spherical components in the residuals to produce new dust intensity maps assuming that the intensity distributions of the gas components are the same in _ g_@xmath13 and @xmath15bands .",
    "the resultant images are shown in figure [ fig : gasdust ] .",
    "as expected , we extracted a spherical structure centered on the nucleus for the gas component associated with the second outburst ( figure [ fig : gasdust ] right ) .",
    "the surface brightness reduced rapidly in a few days not only because the gas diffused out in space , but also because the molecules had lifetimes equivalent to the observed period , i.e. , two days for cn and five days for c@xmath70 during the active solar phase ( huebner et al .",
    "we then examined the radius of the gas component from the images .",
    "figure [ fig : radial ] shows the radial profile of the gaseous coma . considering the sky background noise , we derived the radii of 89@xmath15  on ut 2015 january 16.4 and 182@xmath110  on ut 2015 january 17.4 . assuming that the gas expanded at a constant speed since its ejection , we derived the onset time and expansion speed of the gas component as ut 2015 january 15.5 @xmath1 0.2 and @xmath71 = 1,110 @xmath1 180 m s@xmath2 ( figure [ fig : speed ] ) .",
    "we quoted the maximum ranges of these parameters as these errors in consideration of the margin of measurement because we had only two data points , which is insufficient for deriving the errors by using the least squares method .",
    "we found that the derived gas speed was slightly faster than the observed values of cn emission at other comets around 1 au probably because we derived the speed at a very large distance from the nucleus ( @xmath72 km ) , where the gas flow velocity continued to increase @xcite .    in the left - hand column of figure",
    "[ fig : gasdust ] , we show the dust component images .",
    "a short tail was visible on the first night ( a ) , and an irregular cloud appeared on the second night ( b ) that extended toward the anti - solar direction via the radiation pressure . from the apparent cloud size , we derived the ejection onset time .",
    "we focused on the widths of the dust cloud perpendicular to the sun ",
    "comet direction because dust particles were not accelerated by radiation pressure along that direction .",
    "figure [ fig : speed ] shows the time evolution of the dust cloud width .",
    "the width increased linearly with the progression of time . by using a linear least squares method",
    ", we obtained the onset time on ut 2015 january 15.7 @xmath1 0.1 for dust particles .",
    "although this result agrees with the onset time of gas within the accuracy of our measurements , the trivial lag may suggest that the dust required more time to reach terminal velocity , which should be accelerated by the gas outflow .",
    "we conclude that the second outburst occurred on ut 2015 january 15.615.7 from gas and dust components .",
    "in addition , we derived the dust speed perpendicular to the sun ",
    "comet direction as @xmath73 = 280 @xmath1 20 m s@xmath2 . here",
    ", we should note that this speed might be misleading . because we measured the speed perpendicular to the sun  comet direction , we must underestimate the ejection speed for dust particles in @xmath73 .",
    "to derive the ejection speed , mass , and kinetic energy of the dust cloud in a comprehensive manner , we conducted a model simulation to reproduce the observed morphologies of dust ejecta from the second outburst by following the scheme in @xcite .",
    "the morphologies of dust clouds are generally determined by the ejection speeds and the effects of solar radiation pressure , which can be approximately given by a function of grain size .",
    "therefore , the sizes and ejection speeds of the dust particles can be determined essentially through an investigation of dust cloud morphologies . for a spherical particle ,",
    "the ratio of the radiation pressure with respect to the solar gravity ( @xmath74 ) is given as @xmath74 = @xmath75 , where @xmath9 and @xmath76 are dust radius ( m ) and mass density ( kg m@xmath60 ) , and @xmath77 is a radiation pressure coefficient @xcite . here , we assumed @xmath32 = 1@xmath1610@xmath78 kg m@xmath60 and @xmath77 = 1 . for convenience of fitting",
    ", we assumed that the dust ejecta consisted of two components , a high  speed envelope and a low  speed tail .",
    "we set the ejection epoch of ut 2015 january 15.5 , which gives negligible influence in the result within the error range ( i.e. , 0.1 day ) . for simplicity",
    ", we assumed that dust particles were ejected symmetrically with respect to the solar direction within a cone of a half opening angle of @xmath79 .",
    "we employed a size  dependent ejection speed of @xmath80 = @xmath81 and power  law size frequency distribution given by @xmath82 = @xmath83 in the range between @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "because the ranges of these parameters and fitting scheme are same as those given in @xcite , we do not describe the details here .    through the fitting , we derived the best - fit parameters as shown in table [ tab : parameter ] . because large particles are not sensitive to solar radiation pressure and still resided near the nucleus , we found it impossible to derive the maximum size of particles .",
    "we fixed the minimum value for @xmath74 to @xmath86 ( i.e. , @xmath871 mm ) on the ground that large cometary boulders may not be ejected efficiently through outbursts @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : model ] shows a comparison of the observed dust cloud morphology and our best - fit model , which broadly match .",
    "however , the entire morphology was not perfectly reconstructed by our model probably because the dust ejection was not symmetric with respect to the solar direction . although we do not intend to upgrade the model fitting by fine tuning the central axis of the dust emission here",
    ", we would insist that the outburst location might deviate slightly from the sub - solar point because of this asymmetry .",
    "the maximum @xmath74 was determined well to be @xmath3 = 1.6 @xmath1 0.2 because our observation data covered the faint end of the dust cloud , where particles with @xmath3 were dominant . to fit the width and sunward extension of the cloud",
    ", we obtained the best fit parameters , @xmath88 = 450 @xmath1 30 m s@xmath2 for the envelope particles and @xmath88 = 330@xmath89 m s@xmath2 for the tail .",
    "these parameters resulted in the maximum speed for the smallest particles of @xmath90 = 570 @xmath1 40 m s@xmath2 . for confirmation , we calculated the speed perpendicular to the sun  comet direction with these simulation results , @xmath73 = @xmath91 = 285 @xmath1 40 m s@xmath2 , which is consistent with the value given in section [ subsec : dustgas ] ( i.e. , @xmath73 = 280 @xmath1 20 m s@xmath2 ) . from the model",
    "fitting , we determined that @xmath820% of the cross - section originated from the envelop , whereas @xmath880% was from the tail and coma .",
    "we calculated the total mass and kinetic energy for the second outburst by using the parameters derived from the simulation ( see table [ tab : parameter ] ) and obtained @xmath62 = 7.0 @xmath16 10@xmath4 kg and @xmath92 = 6.5 @xmath16 10@xmath93 j for the second outburst .",
    "cometary outbursts provide opportunities to investigate fresh cometary materials that are embedded in the surface processed layers but appear when a large amount of materials is ejected via explosions .",
    "in particular , the 15p event in 2015 january provided a unique opportunity to determine the maximum @xmath74 value with good precision for several reasons .",
    "because we determined the precise onset time of the outburst , it was easy to follow the motion with respect to the reference time .",
    "in addition , the outburst ejecta were observed at the large phase angle of @xmath35 = 45  ( c.f .",
    "@xmath35 = 19  for 332p and 17  for 17p ) , which enabled observation of the dust motion toward the anti - solar direction more clearly . moreover , the outburst occurred at a smaller heliocentric distance ( 1.0 au ) , where the acceleration by radiation pressure was detected more effectively than those at distant locations such as 1.6 au for 332p and 2.4 au for 17p .",
    "it is well known that radiation pressure force depends on not only size but also and composition .",
    "the @xmath74 values have been investigated theoretically considering fluffy dust particles @xcite and a variety of compositions @xcite . in section [ subsec :",
    "dynamics ] , we adopted a simple model that @xmath74 is inversely proportional to the size under an assumption of a radiation pressure coefficient of @xmath94 = 1 .",
    "however , this assumption holds only when the particle size is larger than the optical wavelength ( @xmath95 = 0.5 ) .",
    "@xmath94 has almost constant value for @xmath960.10.3  and significantly drops as the size of dust grains decreases @xcite . for fluffy dust particles",
    ", @xmath74 is less dependent on the aggregate size but similar to that of each constituent @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the @xmath74 values of dust particles by using a core  mantle spherical particle model composed of silicate and amorphous carbon with different porosities and suggested that cometary dust particles have @xmath3=11.8 .",
    "transparent materials such as silicates and water ice tend to have small @xmath74 maximum values ( i.e. , @xmath971 ) , whereas that of absorbing particles such as carbon is @xmath981 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath3 value determined in our measurement , 1.6 @xmath1 0.2 , is consistent with that in the porous absorbing particles model @xcite and silicate - core , organic - coated grains model for dust aggregates @xcite .",
    "however , our value is inconsistent with those of silicate spheres ( @xmath971 ) and organic spheres ( @xmath983 ) .",
    "cometary outbursts have been observed in a wide variety of comets .",
    "there are some references that analyzed historical observation of cometary outburst ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the occurrence frequency and mass production rate have not been studied well because there is no coordinated observation system for monitoring comet magnitude .",
    "some outbursts could have been missed because the magnitude contrast was too weak before and after to be noticed as an outburst or because the observation condition was not suitable for detection ( i.e. , too close to the sun or moon ) .",
    "nevertheless , some outburst events have been reported in a voluntary manner by amateur observers .",
    "for example , the 17p event was first reported by a. henriquez santana ( spain ) , who noted sudden brightening to 8.4 mag by using a 0.2-m reflector @xcite .",
    "332p was discovered in japan during its outburst by s. murakami and k. ikeya .",
    "they observed this event by looking into the eyepieces of 0.46-m and 0.25-m telescopes when it reached @xmath89 mag @xcite .",
    "moreover , 15p double outbursts with brightening to 89.4 mag were also reported by amateurs through a mailing list of comet observers @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that 17p and 332p events were caused by a phase change of amorphous water ice @xcite , although other mechanisms such as rotational breakup of brittle cometary nuclei can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "excavations via impacts might create an environments favorable to outbursts , as suggested in @xcite . because the energy per unit mass is similar to both events , we conjecture that 15p events were also caused by a phase change of amorphous water ice . here",
    ", we consider the frequency of such outbursts in the inner ( @xmath99 au ) solar system , where the physical mechanism of general cometary activity is confined to sublimation of water ice rather than that of super volatiles such as co @xcite .",
    "for the reason , we excluded frequent outbursts at 29p / schwassmann - wachmann 1 beyond the jupiter orbit .",
    "moreover , we restricted our discussion to jfcs and encke - type comets ( etcs ) because significant observation samples are not available for halley - type comets ( htcs ) and long - period comets ( lpcs ) .",
    "we applied a sample cut of the perihelion distance @xmath100 au to the jpl small - body database search engine and retrieved 505 jfcs and etcs in the list of known comets as of the end of 2015 .",
    "we regarded disintegrated comets as a single object ( e.g. 73p / schwassmann - wachmann 3 b , c , g ... constituted a united body ) .",
    "moreover , we excluded disappeared or dead comets ( 3d / biela and 5d / brorsen ) , designated as `` d/ , '' and main - belt comets , which are unlikely to contain amorphous ice @xcite . among jfcs and etcs",
    ", 357 objects passed their perihelion at least once between 2007 october and 2015 december , which make up @xmath870% of the entire population .",
    "this means that @xmath870% of jfcs and etcs might have a chance to display outburst activities owing to the additional heat from the sun near their perihelia .",
    "we attempted to find outburst events through the smithsonian astrophysical observatory / national aeronautics and space administration ( sao / nasa ) astrophysics data system ( ads ) astronomy query form by inputting `` comet '' and `` outburst '' as abstract terms and manually plumbing the results by reading the abstracts .",
    "in addition , we added one event at 205p which showed an outburst showing similar appearance to 15p ( seiichi yoshida , private communication ) .",
    "we found that 15 outburst events occurred at 11 comets since 2007 ( table 4 ) .",
    "we chose the arbitrary period beginning in 2007 because researchers have increased their consciousness toward outbursts since then , as motivated by the 17p event .",
    "table 4 shows some minor outbursts detected by observers with larger telescopes because these comets drew their attentions due to space mission targets ( 81p / wild 2 and 103p / hartley 2 ) and repeated outbursts at 17p and 15p .",
    "figure [ fig : cumm ] shows the cumulative mass distribution of the outburst ejecta .",
    "we note that six outburst events , including 17p , 168p / hergenrother , 332p , 217p / linear , and two events at 15p , were brightened down to 10 mag .",
    "such events would be detectable with observation through inexpensive equipment such as @xmath810-cm class telescopes .",
    "thus , we conjecture that outbursts @xmath10110 mag would be detected almost completely if observed conditions allowed ground - based observers to make observations .",
    "we fit the ejecta mass distribution with a power - law function for five objects ( i.e. , @xmath10110 mag events except 17p ) and obtained a power index of @xmath102 = 0.45 @xmath1 0.09 .",
    "although there might be no physical basis to support the power - law function in figure [ fig : cumm ] , it is likely that the 17p outburst in 2007 was a very rare phenomenon to be detected within @xmath88 years because the occurrence is one order of magnitude higher than that expected by the power function .",
    "in fact , the large discrepancy for 17p must be a bias of our analysis in which we counted the number of outbursts since the epoch - making event .",
    "in addition , the power - law function fits well in the mass range of 6 @xmath16 10@xmath641 @xmath16 10@xmath51 kg but deviates from the observed values in the mass range of @xmath101 6 @xmath16 10@xmath64 kg .",
    "some outbursts might not be noticed because of the faintness or weak contrast before and after outbursts .",
    "for these reasons , we consider the unbiased outbursts rate in which the ejecta mass corresponds to 6 @xmath16 10@xmath641 @xmath16 10@xmath51 , ( hereafter referred to as `` 15p  class '' outbursts ) .",
    "we applied the poisson distribution following @xcite :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 and @xmath41 denote the number of outburst detections and incidence of outbursts , @xmath105 is the number of observed samples , and @xmath106 ( @xmath107 [ 0 , 1 ] ) is the completeness of the survey .",
    "the 90% upper confidence limit on the incidence , @xmath108 , is given by    @xmath109    assuming that observers could detect 15p  class outbursts completely at the solar elongation of @xmath11060 , we have @xmath106 = 0.67 . over eight years since october 2007 , there were @xmath111 15p  class outbursts out of @xmath105 = 357 comets that passed their perihelion . by solving the implicit eq .",
    "( [ eq : poisson ] ) , we obtained @xmath108 = 0.05 , which suggests an expected number @xmath112 = @xmath113@xmath812 in 8 years , or 1.5 times per year .",
    "therefore , we can express the unbiased cumulative and differential frequency of 15p  class outbursts @xmath114 and @xmath115 as    @xmath116    where @xmath117 = 1.5 yr@xmath2 and @xmath118 = 6 @xmath16 10@xmath64",
    "kg are constants .",
    "we obtained an effective mass production rate of 15p  class outbursts of @xmath8 3 @xmath16 10@xmath4 kg year@xmath2 or @xmath810 kg sec@xmath2 , from ( see appendix a )    @xmath119    where @xmath120=6@xmath1610@xmath64 kg and @xmath121=1@xmath1610@xmath5 kg are lower and upper bounds on the power - law behavior of 15p  class outbursts , respectively .",
    "we consider that the incidence would be underestimated because we optimistically assumed @xmath106 = 0.67 .",
    "some of the outbursts were missed owing to the crowded region of stars or the full lunar phase . even considering these factors ,",
    "which may decrease @xmath106 by several factor , our result would obtain one order - of - magnitude accuracy for the unbiased frequency . therefore , it is reasonable to think that 15p  class outbursts inject dust particles into the interplanetary space at a rate of @xmath4310 kg sec@xmath2 .",
    "the mass is @xmath82 orders of magnitude less than the mass required to sustain the interplanetary dust cloud .",
    "this implies that 15p  class outburst events may not compensate the mass eroded by poynting ",
    "robertson drag and other dynamical mechanisms onto the interplanetary dust .",
    "however , if we integrate @xmath122 up to the 17p - class ejecta mass ( i.e. , @xmath121=1@xmath1610@xmath93 kg ) , the mass production rate from 15p17p class events would be @xmath8500 kg sec@xmath2 , although we are not sure whether the frequency follows a simple power - law function up to the 17p class .",
    "these results suggest that large - scale cometary outbursts might contribute a significant fraction of the interplanetary dust source .",
    "we made an observation of 15p during the perihelion passage in 20152016 , following a report of an outburst in the middle of 2015 december and detected the second outburst on ut 2015 january 15.615.7 , which was equivalent to the first outburst .",
    "the results of our analysis are summarized in the following points .",
    "1 .    gas consisting mostly of c@xmath0 and cn expanded at a speed of 1,110 @xmath1 180 km s@xmath2 , which is slightly faster than the speeds for other comets around 1 au . the excess in speed can be explained by the large distance from the nucleus ( @xmath123 km ) , where the gas flow velocity continues to increase .",
    "the dust ejecta accelerated up to a speed of 570 @xmath1 40 km s@xmath2 , which is comparable to the ejection speeds of 17p and 332p ejecta .",
    "these consistent speeds would have resulted in the similar appearances of these outburst ejecta .",
    "we derived the total mass of dust ejecta as 10@xmath410@xmath5 kg ( @xmath9 = 0.3 1 mm was assumed ) .",
    "this mass is equivalent to that of the 2010 event at 332p but is three orders of magnitude smaller than the 2007 event at 17p .",
    "the polarization degree was measured to 6.8 @xmath1 0.2% at the phase angle @xmath35 = 43 , which fell into the common values of other comets .",
    "this similarity does not mean that outburst ejecta have similar polarimetric properties because it was diffused out at the time of our polarimetric measurement .",
    "5 .   based on the immediate observation of dust ejecta for the second outburst",
    ", we derived a reliable estimate of @xmath3 = 1.6 @xmath1 0.2 .",
    "this value is consistent with the theoretical prediction for porous absorbing particles , suggesting that such porous dust particles could remain inside the cometary nucleus and are released during the outburst .",
    "the kinetic energy per unit mass ( 10@xmath6 j kg@xmath2 ) is close to estimated values of 17p and 332p .",
    "in addition , the dust mass , speed , and kinetic energy are broadly comparable to the measured values of the 2010 outburst at 332p .",
    "this may suggest that these three outbursts occurred by a similar mechanism .",
    "7 .    from a survey of cometary outbursts in publications in the sao / nasa ads",
    ", we estimated that 15p / finlay  class outbursts occur annually , injecting cometary materials into interplanetary space at a rate of @xmath4310 kg sec@xmath2 or more .    *",
