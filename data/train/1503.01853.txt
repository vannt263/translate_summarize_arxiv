    "contrary to the synthesis of the light nuclei  where charged particles are playing a particularly important role @xcite  two different neutron - capture processes , the so - called @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite processes , are required to produce the bulk of naturally occurring nuclides above fe .",
    "these two processes were found to be unable , however , to create 35 neutron - deficient , stable , rare isotopes between @xmath8se and @xmath9hg , which were called `` @xmath1 nuclei '' or `` excluded isotopes '' @xcite .",
    "photodisintegration of stable nuclei either in the outer shells of massive stars during a core - collapse supernova explosion @xcite or during the explosion of a white dwarf @xcite has been suggested as a production mechanism for most of these nuclei.er,@xmath10gd and @xmath11ta nuclei  is still under debate .",
    "recently it was shown that there is a large @xmath6 process contribution to their observed abundances @xcite .",
    "] such a so - called @xmath0-process commences at 2 - 3gk temperatures by sequences of ( @xmath0,n ) reactions , which are replaced with ( @xmath0,p ) and ( @xmath12 ) reactions when reaching sufficiently neutron deficient nuclides in an isotopic chain .",
    "the whole process lasts only a few seconds , before the environment becomes too cool for the photodisintegrations .",
    "recent calculations , however , are under - predicting the heavy @xmath1-nucleus abundances in the mass region between @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "it remains unclear whether this deficiency is due to nuclear cross sections , stellar physics , or if alternative or additional processes have to be invoked @xcite .    in order to resolve this ambiguity , on one hand , improvements on the description of the astrophysical conditions under which the process takes place ( seed isotope abundances , peak temperatures , time scale , etc . )",
    "are needed . on the other hand ,",
    "uncertainties are introduced into the calculations by nuclear physics input , in particular by the reaction rates .",
    "the @xmath0-process models require the use of huge reaction networks including ten thousands of nuclear reactions and the rates of these reactions at a given stellar temperature have to be known .",
    "the reaction rates are generally taken from calculations using the hauser - feshbach ( h - f ) statistical model @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the h - f predictions mainly depends on the adopted nuclear models for the proton- , neutron- , @xmath2- , and @xmath0-widths . the predictions can be tested for only a limited number of reactions , since experimental data in the relevant mass and energy range are very scarce @xcite . although photodisintegrations play a role in the @xmath0-process , their rates are computed from capture rates using detailed balance .",
    "experimental information on quantities ( such as particle- and @xmath0-widths ) for the calculation of the stellar rates ( which can not be directly measured , with a few exceptions@xcite ) can be obtained from the study of capture reactions .",
    "this approach is not only technically less challenging , but also provides more relevant astrophysical information than the direct study of the @xmath0 induced reactions @xcite .",
    "reactions with @xmath2 particle absorbtion or emission in the @xmath0-process are mainly relevant above the neutron shell closure at @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "previous @xmath0-process related experiments found discrepancies between measured and predicted @xmath2-induced cross sections , which suggested low - energy modifications of the @xmath2+nucleus optical potential @xcite or the need to modify the reaction model @xcite .",
    "an important recent break - through was the simultaneous , high - precision measurement of the @xmath5er(@xmath2,@xmath0 ) and @xmath5er(@xmath2,n ) reaction cross sections in a wide energy range below the coulomb barrier @xcite .",
    "it was crucial for the theoretical interpretation that ( @xmath2,@xmath0 ) data were taken even below the ( @xmath2,n ) threshold .",
    "thus , for the first time it was possible to show that the @xmath2+nucleus optical potential requires an energy - dependent modification consistently and unambiguously within the same measurement at high masses .",
    "the aim of the present work is to provide further data in the same energy region for other er isotopes and to test whether they can be described by the same approach as the @xmath5er data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : experimental details are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] ; the resulting cross sections are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , where also a comparison with theoretical predictions is made ; sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] provides the conclusions and a short summary .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the institute for nuclear research , hungarian academy of sciences ( mta atomki , debrecen , hungary ) .",
    "the element er has six stable isotopes with mass numbers a=162 , 164 , 166 , 167 , 168 and 170 .",
    "alpha induced cross sections on the @xmath1 nucleus @xmath5er were already measured @xcite , the aim of the present work was to study the @xmath15er(@xmath2,n)@xmath16yb and @xmath17er(@xmath2,n)@xmath18yb reactions . to determine the @xmath2-induced reaction cross sections the activation method was used ; the @xmath0-rays following the electron capture decay of the yb reaction products",
    "were detected using a low energy photon spectrometer ( leps ) and a coaxial hpge detector .",
    "the following paragraphs provide a detailed description of the experimental setup .",
    "the targets were made by vacuum evaporation of er@xmath19o@xmath20 powder with natural isotopic composition ( ( 1.61@xmath210.03)% @xmath15er and ( 33.6@xmath213.5)% @xmath17er , respectively ) and enriched to ( 8.1@xmath210.2)% in @xmath15er ( @xmath17er content : ( 33.10@xmath213.4)% ) onto 2 @xmath22 m thick , high purity al foils . to check the enrichment provided by the supplier , at e@xmath23 = 15.5 , 16.5 and 17.0mev",
    "the irradiation was carried out using both natural and enriched targets and the derived cross sections were found to be consistent .",
    "the er targets were produced using reductive evaporation technique , the er@xmath19o@xmath20 powder was mixed with zr powder and placed into a carbon crucible heated by electron beam . during the evaporation ,",
    "the distance between the al backing and the evaporation boat was 8 cm , using this distance , uniform targets could be produced .",
    "care was taken to limit the target s zn contamination  identified as the main contaminant of the backing and the zr powder used for the reduction  since during the @xmath2 irradiation @xmath24ge could be produced via the @xmath25zn(@xmath2,n)@xmath24ge reaction .",
    "this isotope ( and its daughter ) was identified as the main disturbing activity since during the @xmath26 decay a 208.95kev @xmath0 ray is emitted which is only 1.15kev above the 207.80kev @xmath0 of our interest ( see table [ tab : decay ] ) . as a first step ,",
    "the quality of the targets were tested by x - ray fluorescence spectroscopy ( xrf ) @xcite .",
    "the targets were excited by filtered primary radiation ( with a 2 mm al filter ) of an oxford instruments x - ray tube ( xtf 6000 br ) having rh target .",
    "it was operated at 30kv voltage and 700@xmath22a electron beam current .",
    "the measurement time was 1000s in each case .",
    "the characteristic x - rays were detected in atmospheric pressure condition enabling the detection of trace elements down to potassium with high sensitivity .",
    "the evaluation of the spectra was carried out with the axil software @xcite .",
    "the absolute thickness of the targets were measured by weighing and using the pixe ( particle induced x - ray emission ) technique @xcite .",
    "the pixe chamber is installed on the left 45@xmath27 beam line of the 5mv vdg accelerator of atomki .",
    "a more detailed description of the pixe setup can be found in ref .",
    "a homogeneous beam of 2mev protons with a 5 mm diameter and a 4 - 5na current was used for the thickness measurement .",
    "the total collected charge in the case of each target was about 2@xmath22c .",
    "the measured spectra were fitted using the pixeklm code @xcite .",
    "typical xrf and pixe spectra can be seen in figure  [ fig : target ] where peaks used for the analysis are marked . from the analysis of the pixe",
    "spectra the erbium target thickness was determined and found to be in agreement with the weighing within maximum of 4.4% .",
    "this 4.4%  as a conservative estimate  has been adopted as the uncertainty of the target thickness determination .    the thickness of the targets varied between 114 and 238@xmath22g/@xmath28 , corresponding to an @xmath2 energy loss of @xmath29e @xmath3015kev ( at e@xmath23=17mev ) and @xmath29e @xmath3039kev ( at e@xmath23=12mev ) , respectively .",
    "the @xmath2 energy loss was calculated using the srim @xcite code .",
    "thicker targets were used at low bombarding energy , where the cross section and the corresponding @xmath0 yield is smaller .",
    "the erbium targets were irradiated with @xmath2 beams from the mgc 20 cyclotron of atomki .",
    "energies were in the range of 12@xmath31e@xmath23@xmath3117mev , covered in steps of about 0.5mev .",
    "after the beam - defining aperture , the chamber was insulated and a secondary electron suppression voltage of -300v was applied at the entrance of the chamber . from the last beam - defining aperture",
    "the whole chamber served as a faraday cup .",
    "the collected charge was measured with a current integrator , the counts were recorded in multichannel scaling mode , stepping the channel in every minute to take into account the possible changes in the beam current . the length of the irradiation were between 7 and 25 hours corresponding to number of incident @xmath2 particles in each irradiation between 0.9@xmath3210@xmath33 and 6.1@xmath3210@xmath33 .    before the experiment",
    "several beam tests were performed to determine the maximum tolerable @xmath2 beam current .",
    "these tests showed that there was no deterioration of the targets using an @xmath2 beam current less than 2.5@xmath22a .",
    "the target thickness was monitored by measuring the yield of the back - scattered @xmath2 particles , for this purpose an ion implanted silicon detector built into the chamber at @xmath34=165@xmath27 relative to the beam direction was used .",
    "the spectra of this detector were recorded regularly and the ratio of the alpha backscattering yields divided by the corresponding current integrator counts were fitted using a linear function .",
    "it was found that the target - losses are typically in the order of 0.6% and the maximum target loss was 1.2 @xmath21 0.15% .",
    "figure [ fig : rbs ] shows a typical alpha backscattering spectrum ( a ) and the corresponding stability curve ( b ) with the fitted linear function .",
    ".[tab : decay ] decay parameters of the @xmath15er(@xmath2,n)@xmath16yb and @xmath17er(@xmath2,n)@xmath18yb reaction products taken from the literature @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the measured ( @xmath2,n ) cross section values are listed in tables  [ tab : results_164er ] and [ tab : results_166er ] .",
    "the quoted uncertainty in the @xmath35 values corresponds to the energy stability of the @xmath2 beam and to the uncertainty of the energy loss in the target , which was calculated using the srim code @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the cross sections is the quadratic sum of the following partial errors : efficiency of the detectors ( 6% ( hpge ) and 5% ( leps ) , respectively ) , number of target atoms ( 4.4% ) , current measurement ( 3% ) , uncertainty of decay parameters ( @xmath318.0% ) , and counting statistics ( 0.4% - 7.4% ) .",
    "some irradiations were repeated at the same energies .",
    "the cross sections were then derived from the averaged results of the irradiations weighted by the statistical uncertainty of the measured values .",
    "the prediction of averaged reaction channel widths is crucial for the hauser - feshbach model of nuclear reactions @xcite . in this well - established model",
    "it is assumed that a large number of unresolved resonances is located around the formation energy @xmath36 of the compound nucleus ( in our case @xmath37yb ) , with @xmath38 being the @xmath2-separation energy in the compound . instead of individual resonance widths ,",
    "an average over all resonance widths is used , leading to averaged neutron- , proton- , @xmath2- , and @xmath0-widths ( further widths are negligible at the investigated energies ) .",
    "these widths , describing the formation and decay of the compound nucleus states are predicted from further models . following @xcite , the sensitivity    @xmath39    describes the change in the cross section @xmath40 when a width @xmath41 is changed by @xmath42 .",
    "not all the widths are important at each energy .",
    "the sensitivity of the calculated cross sections to variations of the different widths is plotted in figure  [ fig : sensi ] ( the proton width is not shown as the cross section is insensitive to it across all shown energies ) .",
    "a sensitivity of unity means that the cross section is changed by the same factor @xmath43 as the input parameter , whereas the cross section does not change when the sensitivity is zero .",
    "as can be seen the cross sections depend dominantly on the @xmath2-width at the upper end of the measured energy range .",
    "this is because the averaged @xmath2-width remains much smaller than the neutron width at energies well above the reaction threshold . towards lower energy approaching the reaction threshold , the neutron width strongly decreases and the cross sections become increasingly sensitive to the neutron- and @xmath0-widths in addition to the @xmath2-widths .",
    "it was already pointed out in @xcite that this behavior does not allow for an unambiguous identification of the source of discrepancy closer to the threshold from ( @xmath2,n ) data alone , if such a discrepancy between cross section measurements and prediction were found .",
    "a similar situation as in @xcite is encountered here .",
    "figure  [ fig : hkm ] shows a comparison of our data to hauser - feshbach predictions performed with the code smaragd @xcite .",
    "in the case of the @xmath17er(@xmath2,n)@xmath16yb reaction , figure  [ fig : hkm ] also includes the previous data by @xcite which are in good agreement with the data obtained in this work . while there is excellent agreement of the data with the standard calculation ( marked by the full line and denoted by `` mcf - s '' in the figures ) at higher energy , an increasing deviation",
    "is found towards lower energy for both reactions .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath2-width is described well at the higher energies .",
    "the main ingredient for the calculation of the averaged @xmath2-width is the @xmath2+nucleus optical potential , for which the global potential by mcfadden and satchler @xcite was used .",
    "the discrepancies towards lower energy can not be unambiguously assigned to a misprediction of a certain width when solely using the present ( @xmath2,n ) data .",
    "a recent measurement provided cross sections for both @xmath5er(@xmath2,n)@xmath44yb and @xmath5er(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath44yb reactions , with ( @xmath2,@xmath0 ) data also below the ( @xmath2,n ) threshold @xcite . due to the additional ( @xmath2,@xmath0 )",
    "data it was possible to show in @xcite that an energy - dependent modification of the optical @xmath2+nucleus potential is required at low energies .",
    "additionally , close to the ( @xmath2,n ) threshold the ratio of the neutron- to @xmath0-width had to be increased by about 40% ( without the possibility to assign this change to either width ) .",
    "for comparison , in figure  [ fig : hkm ] we show also cross sections obtained from calculations using the same modifications of widths as in @xcite ( dashed lines labelled `` mod '' ) . again",
    ", good agreement is obtained without further changes .",
    "it should be noted that a modification of the neutron- to @xmath0-width ratio only affects the cross sections very close above the reaction thresholds ( up to about 0.7 mev above threshold ) because of the strongly decreasing sensitivity to those widths with increasing energy , which can be seen in figure  [ fig : sensi ] .",
    "therefore , the changes in the cross sections in the energy ranges covered by the present measurements , and shown in figure  [ fig : hkm ] , are solely due to the modification of the @xmath2 widths .",
    "for the first time , ( @xmath2,n ) cross sections of the @xmath1 nucleus @xmath15er were measured at energies well below the coulomb barrier , using the activation technique .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath17er(@xmath2,n)@xmath18yb reaction was studied at energies overlapping with the results of a recent measurement performed by @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the two data sets is almost perfect , this fact strengthens further the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "the experimental data were compared to statistical model predictions .",
    "good agreement was found at the upper end of the measured energy range when using the global @xmath2+nucleus optical potential by @xcite but deviations between data and calculations were found towards the reaction threshold in both reactions . using the same set of parameters",
    "as determined in a previous , simultaneous measurement of @xmath5er(@xmath2,@xmath0 ) and @xmath5er(@xmath2,n ) @xcite works well also in the present cases .",
    "this confirms the necessity of an energy - dependent modification of the @xmath2+nucleus optical potential at very low energies .",
    "the present measurements enlarge the database for deriving an improved global @xmath2+nucleus optical potential at very low energies by future theoretical models . the relevant astrophysical energy range , however , is below the reaction threshold and therefore further information on the energy dependence of the @xmath2 widths at astrophysical energies requires additional experiments .",
