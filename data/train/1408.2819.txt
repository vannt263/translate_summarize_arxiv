    "the bulk photovoltaic effect ( bpve ) is the phenomenon in which electromagnetic radiation imparted on a single - phase insulating or semi - conducting material leads to a zero - voltage photo - current . like traditional photovoltaics , ( @xmath3 @xmath4 si , cdte , cigs , and gaas ) , in order for a material to exhibit a significant bpve response from sunlight and",
    "thus be useful as a solar energy harvesting material , it needs to have a band gap in the visible spectrum ( 1.1 @xmath5 3.1 ev ) or the near - infrared . unlike traditional photovoltaics , which require an interface between two materials , the bpve is achieved through the broken inversion symmetry in a single material.@xcite additionally , only materials with nonzero polarization",
    "can give a current in response to unpolarized light , making them materials of interest for solar conversion .",
    "this constraint stems from the physics of the non - linear optical process termed  shift current , \" which we have demonstrated in our earlier theoretical works is the dominant mechanism for generating the bpve in the ferroelectrics bifeo@xmath1 , batio@xmath1 and pbtio@xmath1@xcite ; if a material is non - centrosymmetric but possesses no polarization , then the directions of the generated shift currents from unpolarized light will sum to zero and produce no net current.@xcite many oxide perovskites have both of these properties , and the bpve effect has been realized experimentally in them.@xcite    further , based on the data from our studies on batio@xmath1 and pbtio@xmath1 , we suggested that materials with elemental combinations conducive to covalent bonding and delocalized electronic states can lead to large shift current effects.@xcite our data also indicated that the magnitude of polarization is not simply proportional to the shift current produced.@xcite these observations have shaped our materials search .",
    "we avoid @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 compounds with @xmath10-sites that have transition metals possessing localized conduction band electronic states , and concentrate on compounds with @xmath10-@xmath11 electronegativity differences less than one .",
    "a natural set of @xmath10-@xmath11 combinations that meet these criteria are compounds with @xmath10-sites from groups 14 and 15 , and @xmath11-sites from groups 16 and 17 , except for o and f which have too high an electronegativity to meet the covalency requirement . in order to broaden the search ,",
    "we remove the perovskite requirement of @xmath12 = @xmath13 = 1 = @xmath14/3 .    in the current work ,",
    "we calculate the bpve of three ternary compounds that meet these criteria : lias@xmath11@xmath0 ( @xmath11 = s , se ) and naasse@xmath0 .",
    "all three have been synthesized in polar monoclinic space groups : @xmath15 for the first two and @xmath16 for the third.@xcite as well , all three compounds have been documented as having experimental band gaps well within the visible spectrum : 1.60 ev for liass@xmath0 , 1.11 ev for liasse@xmath0 , and 1.75 ev for naasse@xmath0.@xcite these compounds are distinguished by their one dimensional infinite as-@xmath11 chains , as shown in figure [ one ] .",
    "the chains in lias@xmath11@xmath0 and naasse@xmath0 are different . in lias@xmath11@xmath0 ,",
    "the chain atoms are confined to planes not containing li , and the li atoms arrange themselves in a nearly square planar arrangement with the remaining non - chain @xmath11 atoms . on the other hand , in naasse@xmath0",
    ", the na atoms do not form square planar arrangements with se .",
    "the differences in the cation arrangements and the chain are clearly visible in figure [ one ] .",
    "additional chain descriptions are detailed in bera _",
    "et al._@xcite a final difference between the two types of compounds is that the @xmath17 angles , ( between the @xmath12 and @xmath18 lattice vectors ) , in liass@xmath0 and liasse@xmath0 are 113.12@xmath19 and 113.21@xmath19 , while @xmath17 for naasse@xmath0 is 90.45@xmath19 , making this crystal nearly orthorhombic . in this paper , we report the calculated bulk photovoltaic shift current and glass coefficient of these materials .",
    "we use quantum espresso@xcite to perform density functional theory calculations with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof generalized gradient exchange - correlation functional on the three compounds described above .",
    "we have found that calculations using experimental geometries , where available , allow for more faithful reproduction of electronic properties .",
    "additionally , the response obtained for relaxed structures tends to be stronger , so that the results shown are comparatively conservative .",
    "we use the coordinates listed in the fiz karlsruhe icsd database for liass@xmath0 and liasse@xmath0.@xcite the coordinates for naasse@xmath0 are taken from the supporting information of bera _ et al._@xcite the results of the scf calculation are then used to calculate the partial density of states ( pdos ) and band structure , and the wavefunctions and energies are also used as inputs for the shift current calculation .",
    "we use the nomenclature for the high symmetry points as found in the bilbao crystallographic server to create band diagrams.@xcite we use abinit to calculate the polarization.@xcite norm - conserving optimized pseudopotentials@xcite were created using the opium software package.@xcite all calculations use a plane - wave basis set with a 50 ry plane - wave cutoff .    as described in refs .",
    "@xcite , shift current is a second order , rectification - like optical process wherein charge is transported by coherent states that are created by interaction with light and allowed a net momentum as a consequence of inversion symmetry breaking .",
    "it may be derived using time dependent perturbation theory under a dipole approximation treatment of the classical electromagnetic field . with @xmath20 as the current density due to illumination with electric field strength @xmath21 , the response tensor @xmath22 is expressed as :    j_q & = _",

    "the absorption coefficient enters the glass coefficient expression as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is absorption coefficient tensor . the shift current from a thick film can be expressed as :    j_q ( ) = | e_r^0 ( ) |^2 w = g_rrq()i_r()w    where @xmath35 is intensity and @xmath36 is the sample width .",
    "since we are , at present , concerned only with response to unpolarized light , we ignore terms off - diagonal in the electric field , as these can not contribute to current . to see this",
    ", we compute the general response in the @xmath37 direction for unpolarized light with wavevector along @xmath38 . for arbitrary decomposition of the unpolarized light we obtain two orthogonal components    & = e_0 + & ",
    "= e_0    the current generated is then    j_z=&+ e_0 + j_z=&e_0 ^ 2 + + & e_0 ^ 2 + j_z=&e_0 ^ 2    thus , for unpolarized light , elements off - diagonal in the field will give canceling contributions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table [ thedata ] presents the calculated maximum shift current density response and maximum glass coefficient , as well as the calculated and experimental values for the band gap , for the three compounds , ranked by maximum shift current response . in order to show clearly the maximum responses , we rotate the lattices of the compounds counterclockwise in the @xmath39@xmath40-plane .",
    "we define @xmath41 to be the angle between the @xmath18 lattice vector and the @xmath42-component - aligned polarization of the incoming radiation at which maximum response occurs .",
    "these values are also listed in the table .",
    "a cartoon of the orientation for lias@xmath11@xmath43 ( @xmath11 = s , se ) is provided in figure [ rot ] .",
    "the nearly orthorhombic compound , naasse@xmath43 , has its maximum shift current response at @xmath41 = 0@xmath19 , while the @xmath6 = li compounds , with nearly identical @xmath17 angles of 113.12@xmath19 and 113.25@xmath19 , obtain maximum shift current response at @xmath41 = 11@xmath19 .",
    "the bulk photovoltaic effect in bifeo@xmath1 has been the subject of significant recent study and interest , ( @xmath3 @xmath4 refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and thus serves as our benchmark .",
    "it has been shown both theoretically and experimentally as having a maximum current density of 5@xmath4410@xmath45 ( a / m@xmath46)/(w / m@xmath46 ) at 3.3 ev and a maximum glass coefficient of 5@xmath4410@xmath47 cm / v at 2.75 ev.@xcite",
    "each of the chalcogenide compounds in this study has at least an order of magnitude greater shift current response and glass coefficient magnitude at least five times larger as well .    the total shift current responses and glass coefficients are plotted in figure [ sss ] between 0 and 3.1 ev for @xmath48@xmath11@xmath0",
    ". on each plot ,",
    "the responses are shifted to the right by the underestimation of the experimental band gap .",
    "as depicted , the chalcogenides all show shift current responses for photon energies approximately 1 ev lower than the onset of the response for bifeo@xmath1 , due to their smaller band gaps . at all energies below @xmath492.9 ev",
    ", liasse@xmath43 has a superior shift current response and glass coefficient to liass@xmath43 and naasse@xmath43 . above @xmath492.9",
    "ev , naasse@xmath43 has higher responses .",
    "the responses are labeled such that the double small letters indicate the direction of the incoming radiation and the capital letter indicates the direction of the induced current .",
    "( the reason for the two small letters is that the bpve is a second - order process in the @xmath50 field . ) with respect to bifeo@xmath1 and its polarization value of 0.9 c / m@xmath46,@xcite these data clearly reinforce our earlier work showing again that the magnitude of shift current is not simply correlated with magnitude of material polarization.@xcite    pdos results in figure [ pdos1 ] show that in each of the three compounds , the valence band edge down to -3 ev is dominated by s @xmath51 or se @xmath52 states , while the conduction band up to 3 ev is dominated by the as @xmath52 states .",
    "thus , all electron transitions from the valence to the conduction band are overwhelmingly @xmath2 - @xmath2 .",
    "band structures in figure [ bands1 ] indicate that these three compounds all have direct band gaps .",
    "the two compounds with @xmath6 = li demonstrate significant dispersion in the conduction band .",
    "given the relative flatness of the conduction and valence bands in the vicinity of the band gap for naasse@xmath0 , one would expect the other two compounds to have both smaller hole and electron effective masses , and hence higher mobility .",
    "thus , of the three compounds , we would expect liasse@xmath0 to produce the most current of the three compounds .",
    "we have calculated maximum shift current responses in the visible range , adjusted for theoretical underestimation of experimental band gaps , in the range of 49 - 109@xmath4410@xmath45 ( a / m@xmath46)/(w / m@xmath46 ) for liass@xmath43 , liasse@xmath43 and naasse@xmath0 .",
    "the maximum shift current response values for liass@xmath0 , liasse@xmath0 and naasse@xmath43 represent an order of magnitude improvement in response to visible light in comparison to bifeo@xmath1 .",
    "glass coefficient responses are 4 - 8 times greater than that of bifeo@xmath1 .",
    "we note that expected efficiencies , while desirable , are not currently computable from first - principles . to estimate efficiency",
    ", the photovoltage that can be sustained must be known ; this depends strongly on the particular qualities of the sample and device as well as the bulk current density response , as observed in refs .",
    "@xcite . with band gaps below 2 ev ,",
    "these non - perovskite , non - oxide compounds , with smaller polarization magnitudes than other oxide perovskites for which the bpve has been evaluated , not only offer a higher shift current magnitude response , but capture more of the solar spectrum than bifeo@xmath1 as well .",
