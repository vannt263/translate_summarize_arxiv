    "<S> in this paper , we investigate the stability of a feedback interconnection between a linear system and a duhem hysteresis operator , where the linear system and the duhem hysteresis operator satisfy either the counter - clockwise ( ccw ) or clockwise ( cw ) input - output dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we present sufficient conditions for the stability of the interconnected system that depend on the cw or ccw properties of the linear system and the duhem operator . based on these results </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a control design methodology for stabilizing a linear plant with a hysteretic actuator or sensor without requiring precise information on the hysteresis operator . </S>"
