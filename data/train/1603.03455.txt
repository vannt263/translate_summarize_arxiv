    "particle size measurements are crucial across many industries in the manufacturing of particulate products , such as pharmaceuticals , agrochemicals , detergents , pigments and food .",
    "particle size and shape have a profound influence on downstream processing as well as on final product properties through a variety of product attributes , such as solubility , dissolution kinetics , flowability , etc .",
    "there are various particles sizing methods commonly employed in practice , some of them online and others offline @xcite .",
    "one of the widely used techniques for measuring of particle size distribution ( psd ) in dispersions is laser diffraction @xcite which is typically arranged in a flow - through setting but is most often used off line as there are limits on dispersion densities due to multiple scattering .",
    "laser diffraction measurement involves the collection of scattered light from a dilute dispersion of particles by an array of detectors placed at different spatial locations so that they cover a certain span of scattering angles @xmath0 .",
    "since the angular dependence of the scattered light intensity originating from a particle is a function of the size and shape of the particle , as well as the orientation of the particle with respect to the incident laser beam , the particle size and shape can be inferred from the corresponding scattering intensity pattern . however , as there is typically a distribution of particle sizes across a population , the intensity pattern measured by the detectors will be a convolution of the intensity patterns from all the particles of different sizes in the dispersion .    the estimation of the psd from the measured scattering intensity pattern ( scattering intensity as a function of scattering angle ) involves solving an inverse problem using a suitable scattering model which describes the scattering intensity for particles of a given shape , size and optical properties .",
    "the inversion is implemented in the software accompanying laser diffraction instruments , typically using the mie scattering model @xcite for spherical particles as a default , regardless of the shape of particles in the measured sample .",
    "this can lead to various artefacts , such as apparently multimodal distributions in psd estimates ( e.g. , @xcite ) when the shape of the particles in the sample deviates significantly from spherical .",
    "this could result in misleading estimates of mean particles sizes with severe consequences for applications where the process is very sensitive to the particle sizes .",
    "this is particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry where many of the active pharmaceutical ingredients are crystallised in needle - like habits .    in this paper , we demonstrate that multimodal psds can be obtained from the inversion process even when the true particle size is monodisperse , i.e. , all particles are of the same size .",
    "we simulate the scattering intensity patterns for monodisperse population of needle - like particles to explain how multimodal psd artefacts arise due to solving the inverse problem using a scattering model for spherical particles .",
    "we compute the angularly dependent scattering intensity for needle - like particles of specified optical properties using a model for infinitely long cylinders with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 micrometres",
    ". then we solve the inverse problem of estimating psd from the angularly dependent scattering intensity pattern using the mie theory for spherical particles , mimicking the analysis performed when using commercial laser diffraction instruments .",
    "since the psd of needle - like particles is exactly specified here , the estimated psd from the inversion can be directly compared with the actual psd .",
    "we consider two limiting cases , when needle - like particles are assumed to perfectly aligned with flow which is perpendicular to the incident laser beam and when they adopt random orientations .",
    "we show that in either case the inversion results in estimated psd that are multimodal where smaller modes are mathematical artefacts due to inversion and we explain how these are related to different shapes of intensity scattering patterns for needle - like particles compared to those of spheres .",
    "the scattering intensity patterns for needle - like particles will be simulated using the scattering theory for infinitely long cylinders @xcite . even though the theory was developed for infinitely long cylinders , it is applicable for needle - like particles with lengths significantly larger than their diameters @xcite .",
    "such long thin particles of approximately cylindrical shape are similar to needle - like particles often encountered in pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturing .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show typical particles of cellobiose octaacetate , benzoic acid and metformin hydrochloride . as needle - like particles",
    "are modelled as infinitely long cylinders in this work , the circular cross - sectional diameters of these cylinders will be used to represent the size of needle - like particles as their length can not be specified .",

    "both the incident and scattered light have components parallel and perpendicular to the scattering plane ( the plane containing the incident and scattered light ) @xcite .",

    "the wavelength of @xmath6 m was used in all calculations in this work consistent with the wavelength of red light in typical commercial laser diffraction instruments .",
    "the intensity of the scattered light @xmath7 ( which is a function of the scattering angle @xmath0 ) is related to the intensity of the incident light @xmath8 by means of the phase or scattering matrix @xmath9 as @xcite ( see also section 1 of the supplementary information for details )    @xmath10    where the magnitude of the wave vector @xmath11 has been discretised to @xmath12 were used in all the calculations in this work .",

    "the choice of @xmath43 for rescaling the scattering intensity is reasonable since the quantity @xmath44 assumes a flat profile at the zero @xmath11 limit for particles of different shapes and sizes and refractive indices @xcite . if the first detector in the array of detectors ( sketched in fig .",

    "i , the decay of the scattering intensity pattern for needle - like particles slows down at higher @xmath11 values when compared with those of spheres of the same cross - sectional diameter as seen in fig .",

    "as before , the consequence of these additional peaks introduced into the estimated psd by the spherical model is that the estimated @xmath65 values can be significantly lower that the actual cross - sectional diameter of needle - like particles as seen in fig . [ fig7](d ) .",
    "we have demonstrated the origin of artefacts which arise due to applying a model for scattering by spherical particles to solve the inverse problem for laser diffraction when the scattering intensity pattern comes from a population of needle - like particles .",

    "the estimated psds are typically multimodal with the largest size mode close to the actual cross - sectional diameter but additional smaller size modes are not physical .",
    "these modes are mathematical artefacts arising from different shapes of scattering patterns of spheres and thin cylinders .",
    "needle - like particles of various lengths would be expected to give rise to similar effects which would depend on the aspect ratio of the particles .",

    "this approach is used in commercial laser diffraction instruments , and it can lead to misleading conclusions about the psd of the particles under analysis , in terms of unrealistic multimodal distributions and underestimating the mean particle size in terms of volume weighted mean diameter values . therefore , the way forward is to obtain information about particle shape and apply appropriate scattering models for particles to be analysed .",
