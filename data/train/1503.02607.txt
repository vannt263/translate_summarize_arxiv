    "these _ irreducible decompositions _ are thus special cases of primary decomposition , but likewise are hard to compute in general .",
    "if @xmath0 is a monomial ideal , however , this task is much easier : any monomial ideal is an intersection of irreducible ideals that are themselves monomial ideals ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.27 ) for polynomial rings and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.4 ) for affine semigroup rings ) , and these _ monomial irreducible decompositions _ are heavily governed by combinatorics .",

    "we answer question  [ q : binomirrdecomp ] using the theory of mesoprimary decomposition @xcite .",
    "our response has three stages .",
    "first , congruences in noetherian commutative monoids admit _ soccular decompositions _ ( theorem  [ t : socculardecomp ] ) , which should be considered the direct combinatorial analogues of binomial irreducible decompositions .",
    "( _ soccular congruences _",
    "( definition  [ d : soccular ] ) fail to be irreducible for the same reason that prime congruences do ; see the end of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2 ) for details . )",
    "second , lifting to binomial ideals the method of constructing soccular congruences ( but not lifting the construction itself ; see example  [ e : nonsoccularbinoccular ] ) yields ideals that are , in a precise sense , as irreducible as possible while remaining binomial ( definition  [ d : binoccular ] ) .",
    "the resulting notion of _ binoccular decomposition _ for binomial ideals ( theorem  [ t : binocculardecomp ] ) proceeds as far as possible toward irreducible decomposition while remaining confined to the category of binomial ideals .",
    "theorem  [ t : nonbinomialdecomp ] demonstrates , by example , that the confines of binomiality can prevent reaching all the way to irreducible decomposition by exhibiting a binomial ideal not expressible as an intersection of binomial irreducible ideals , thus solving eisenbud and sturmfels problem in the negative .",
    "that said , our third and final stage produces irreducible decompositions of binomial ideals ( corollary  [ c : irreducibledecomp ] ) in a manner that is as combinatorial as mesoprimary decomposition : each coprincipal component has a canonical _ irreducible closure _",
    "( definition  [ d : irreducibleclosure ] ) that , while not itself an irreducible ideal , has a canonical primary decomposition all of whose components are irreducible ( theorem  [ t : irrclosureprimarydecomp ] ) .",
    "all three of the decompositions in this paper ",
    "soccular , binoccular , and irreducible  descend directly from coprincipal decomposition ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems  8.4 and  13.3 ) ( see theorems  [ t : kmcong ] and  [ t : kmessential ] for restatements of these results ) .",
    "this is true in two senses : ( i )  the components in all three types of decomposition are cogenerated by the same witnesses that cogenerate the corresponding coprincipal components , and ( ii )  the components themselves are constructed by adding new relations to the corresponding coprincipal components . to be more precise , soccular congruences",
    "are constructed by adding relations between all pairs of _ protected witnesses _ ( definition  [ d : protected ] ) for coprincipal congruences while maintaining their cogenerators ( theorem  [ t : protected ] and corollary  [ c : protected ] ) .",
    "similarly , binoccular ideals are constructed by repeatedly throwing into a coprincipal ideal as many binomial socle elements as possible while maintaining a monomial cogenerator in the socle ( definitions  [ d : binoccularclosure ] and  [ d : binoccularcomponent ] ) .",
    "in contrast , irreducible closures allow arbitrary polynomials to be thrown in , not merely binomials . although this concrete description of irreducible closure is accurate , the construction of irreducible closures ( definition  [ d : irreducibleclosure ] ) is accomplished with more abstract , general commutative algebra .",
    "consequently , the reason why irreducible closures have canonical irreducible decompositions is particularly general , from the standpoint of commutative algebra , involving embeddings of rings inside of gorenstein localizations ( remark  [ r : gor ] ) .",
    "finally , it bears mentioning that for the proofs of correctness  at least for the decompositions in rings as opposed to monoids  we make explicit a unifying principle , in the form of equivalent criteria involving socles and monomial localization ( lemma  [ l : intersection ] ) , for when a binomial ideal in a monoid algebra equals a given intersection of ideals .",
