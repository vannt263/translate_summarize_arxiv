    "photon transport in a random packing of disks using fresnel s intensity reflectance is discussed in sec .",
    "discussions , conclusions , and an outlook are presented in sec .",
    "following a step - by - step approach to reality , we deliberately focus on _ two_-dimensional granular systems .",
    "our model granular medium is a random packing of circular disks .",
    "all nonoverlapping disks have the same radius @xmath11 , and cover a fraction @xmath12 of the plane .",
    "the refractive indices of grains and host medium are @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath13 .",
    "grains ( @xmath14 ) are larger than the visible light wavelength ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore , we employ ray optics . a light beam or photon experiences transmission or reflection as it hits the surface of a grain .",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the intensity reflectance for photons moving in the host medium and hitting a grain .",
    "similarly , we denote by @xmath17 the intensity reflectance for photons moving in a gain and hitting its surface . according to the fresnel s formulas ,",
    "both @xmath16 and @xmath17 depend on the polarization state of the light , incidence angle @xmath18 , @xmath10 and @xmath9 , see appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "indeed the fresnel s intensity reflectance @xmath19 is @xmath20 for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the critical angle . our model does respect the total internal reflection phenomena .",
    "it is instructive to consider a toy model , a one - dimensional lattice of ( point ) grains .",
    "on hitting a grain , a photon will be either reflected by probability @xmath23 or persist on its direction of motion  @xcite .",
    "this leads to a persistent random walk of the photons , where the walker remembers its direction from the previous step  @xcite .",
    "now it is clear that implementing the rules of ray optics for photon diffusion in two- and three - dimensional granular media results in a generalized persistent random walk .",
    "firstly introduced by frth as a model for diffusion in a number of biological problems  @xcite , and shortly after by taylor in the analysis of turbulent diffusion  @xcite , the persistent random walks are employed in polymers  @xcite , landauer diffusion coefficient for a one - dimensional solid  @xcite , and general transport mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "to simplify our analytical treatment of photons random walk , we further assume that ( i ) the length of photon steps outside ( inside ) the grains is @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , _ i.e. _ we neglect the fact that the length of photon steps are not equal .",
    "( ii ) a photon which transmits into or out of a grain , does not change its direction of motion .",
    "in other words , we neglect the fact that the angle of refraction is not equal to the angle of incidence .    in the two - dimensional space , each photon step",
    "can be specified by an angle relative to the @xmath26 axis .",
    "consider a photon which moves in the host medium along the direction @xmath27 and hits a grain with an incidence angle @xmath28 , see fig .",
