    "it is useful both in proving the result and to find the extremal polynomial exhibiting exactness of the upper estimate .",
    "rivlin and shapiro assumed strict convexity  which means that no straight line segment can lie on the boundary @xmath165  for they needed it in order to apply their basic method , that of the extremal signatures .",
    "in fact they needed this condition in proving lemma [ l : parsup ] _ by use of extremal signatures _ , which was their goal in illustrating the diverse applications of the method .",
    "indeed , their method proved to be very successful in multivariate polynomial problems , but they themselves remarked in @xcite that regarding the chebyshev problem , a direct , more geometrical argument can give more , they remark once again : `` it is , of course , possible to obtain this result more geometrically but with ( 42 ) at hand we prefer to utilize it . '' and ending the application to problem 3 , they state once again : `` to sum up : to solve problem 3 we need only a pair of parallel supporting hyperplanes to @xmath56 such that the points of tangency , @xmath166 and @xmath167 , are collinear with @xmath168 .

    "proof for the case of a not necessarily strictly convex @xmath148 was then presented in @xcite .",
    "[ [ convbodyapprox ] ]    however , there is no need for any new proof until we keep working in @xmath157 , as theorem [ th : rivlinshapiro ] of rivlin and shapiro for strictly convex bodies directly implies the general case once we take into account the next standard fact .",

    "* proposition 2.2 ) .",
    "anyway , we sketch two proofs in the sequel .    _",
    "first proof of lemma [ l : strictapprox ] .",
    "_ working in @xmath157 one may fix any positive @xmath170 , approximate the given convex body @xmath56 within @xmath171 by some polyhedra @xmath172 , then @xmath172 by a special polyhedra @xmath173 with only 1-codimensional simplices as sides , and then finally change very slightly the ( then finitely many ) halfspaces , giving as their intersection @xmath173 , so that the resulting body be strictly convex .",
    "a way for this last change is to substitute each halfspace @xmath174 by a large ball @xmath175 , exhibiting a very small hausdorff distance @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is taken so large ( but fixed ) that a given large neighbourhood of @xmath56 is already contained in it .",
    "in fact , it is easier to see that we get what we want if we construct these balls the following way .",
    "we pick up one point from the relative interior of each of the sides of @xmath173 , and move it slightly outward in normal direction : then the corresponding balls @xmath175 are defined as the balls drawn around those simplices of full dimension , which arise from the original sides and the corresponding , slightly moved points outside . clearly if the points to be moved are fixed , and",
    "the length of the move is fixed for all sides equally as , say , @xmath178 , then in function of @xmath179 , the intersection of these balls , ( which always contain @xmath173 for small enough @xmath178 ) , will finally shrink to @xmath173 .",
    "that concludes the proof of the lemma .    having this approximation lemma the proof of the general case of theorem [ th : rivlinshapiro ] is done by referring to the continuity of @xmath4 and also of @xmath180",
    ", the latter understood as a function on @xmath181 , where @xmath182 denotes the set of all convex bodies , and is equipped with the metric of hausdorff distance .",
    "even the extremal polynomial obtains using the corresponding extremal polynomials of the strict convex case and compactness in @xmath157 .",
    "but is continuity clear ?",
    "well , continuity of @xmath180 can be checked explicitly , but it may be rather tedious , compared to our expectations that it should be such anyway .",
    "so the best is to get around any tedious calculations , and prove something even better , that of _ convexity _ in @xmath5 and admitting a lipschitz bound even as a two - variable function on @xmath183 , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "the property of a normed space @xmath11 that all convex bodies are intersections of closed balls is called the mazur intersection property , and this property fails in some spaces : see e.g. @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an even nicer proof of lemma [ l : strictapprox ] can be presented if we apply the general fact , also well - known to geometers , that strict convexity , in fact , is the dual property to smoothness ( cf .",

    "sarantopoulos was able to obtain that @xmath338 or , in case @xmath339 , i.e. when @xmath56 is the unit ball of the normed space @xmath11 , then @xmath340 a fully satisfactory answer for the symmetric case . a nice , elementary argument of wilhelmsen",
    "@xcite presented in the full generality of convex , not necessarily symmetric bodies , but with a factor 4 in place of 2 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that does not remain true for all convex bodies .",
    "finally , skalyga @xcite found @xmath341 note that @xmath342 the author of @xcite also remarks that the estimate is sharp in the sense of being subject to no improvement in the full generality of all convex bodies and in all normed spaces .",
    "for some further information see @xcite .",
    "it is important , in particular for doing analysis on infinite dimensional spaces , to have a control over the size of derivatives of any order . in the classical case of a real interval",
    "it was done by vladimir markov , and the answer e.g. for @xmath53 $ ] is @xmath343 which is sharp again for the chebyshev polynomial @xmath4 .    at present",
    "we are far from having a nearly as precise estimate as for the general case of normed spaces .",
    "these can not be obtained , not even for dimension one , by simple iterations of the estimates for the first derivative , what gives only substantially weaker results .",
    "however , for the important special case of a hilbert space an exact extension of this inequality is known , see @xcite .    * ( munoz  sarantopoulos , 2002).*[th : hilbert ] let @xmath344 be any hilbert space and @xmath49 be an arbitrary polynomial of degree @xmath20 , that is @xmath345",

    "hence even in the symmetric ( i.e. , norm unit ball ) case there is no obvious way to get close to the conjecture ( or the truth ) .      as mentioned above ,",
    "combining or iterating known estimates does not necessarily give best results even if the parts put together are exact in their kind .",
    "another example is the following classical question , which can be considered a composition of the bernstein problem and the chebyshev problem ( although simple and basic in itself ) .",
