    "the method of _ transformation optics _ , originally developed in optics community for passive cloaking @xcite , offers a novel method for controlling electromagnetic waves using the subtle idea of coordinate transformation .",
    "based on this method , invisibility cloaks for electromagnetic waves were designed , fabricated and successfully tested @xcite .",
    "the most important necessary condition for applicability of the method of transformation optics is that the governing equations must be _ form invariant _ under coordinate transformation .",
    "since physical systems admitting wave solutions share many common properties , it is well expected that the transformation optics method works in any wave system with form - invariant governing equation .",
    "this has been confirmed and cloaks have been designed and tested in a variety of other systems such as for acoustic waves @xcite , water waves @xcite and matter waves @xcite .",
    "flexural waves , such as those propagating on a thin elastic plates , have a governing equation that is known to be not form - invariant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the classical method of designing a cloak through transformation media method does not directly work in the context of flexural waves .",
    "one crude approximation is to adopt a form - invariant equation whose form is close to the governing equation of flexural waves and then use classical linear cloak design @xcite .",
    "while the resulting wave pattern about a to - be - cloaked cylinder may look like wave patterns of cloaking , a quantitative investigation of cloaking efficiency @xcite reveals that such a cloak has a poor and in many cases even _ negative _ cloaking efficiency ( i.e. an object with the cloak about it scatters even more energy than the object without one , see also fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] ) . alternatively ,",
    "if it is assumed that both density and elasticity of the material can be independently tuned , then a condition is obtained under which the highest order term of the governing equation satisfies the cloaking requirement @xcite .",
    "this is theoretically an improvement , as the highest order term can be shown to play a more important role that the rest of the terms in the governing equation .",
    "nevertheless , fabricating a material with a variable density _ and _ elasticity is a serious challenge @xcite . along the same line",
    ", more degrees of freedom such as several independent elastic parameters may be assumed to improve the theoretical performance @xcite , but this makes the realization of the cloak in physical space even farther from achievable .    here",
    "we present the design of a perfect broadband cloak for flexural waves .",
    "for the cloak to be realizable in the physical domain , we put the constraint that the density @xmath0 is constant and only the modulus of elasticity @xmath1 can be changed across the cloak .",
    "we employ a nonlinear transformation and , by choosing proper material properties and pre - stressing , match term - by - term the coefficients in the original and transformed equations .",
    "we show rigorously that the transformed equation matches perfectly with the orthotropic and inhomogeneous plate s equation .",
    "for an isotropic plate with thickness @xmath2 and density @xmath3 , governing equation for out of the plane displacement @xmath4 in the @xmath5 direction normal to the plate s surface reads ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the flexural rigidity , @xmath8 is the young modules , @xmath9 is the poisson ratio , and @xmath10 is the horizontal laplacian operator in @xmath11 directions .    to cloak a circular region @xmath12 ( radius @xmath13 ) with a cloak of outer radius @xmath14 co - centered with @xmath12 , we need to map the region of @xmath15 to the cloaking region @xmath16 .",
    "we use the nonlinear transformation @xmath17 defined as @xmath18 that has a special property of its jacobian being a constant @xcite . using this transformation and",
    "further assuming a time - periodic motion of frequency @xmath19 , equation is maped to ( using lemma 2.1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 note that if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 .    in a traditional cloak design for form - invariant governing equations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , material properties as functions of spatial variables are determined such that the transformed equation with the new material properties becomes equivalent of the original equation .",
    "if we do the same here , the rigidity @xmath24 becomes spatially variable in different directions , which means the required material for cloaking is _ inhomogeneous _ and _ orthotropic_. the issue is , equation with @xmath25 , is _ not _ the governing equation for an inhomogeneous and orthotropic plate .",
    "in fact , the governing equation for a general @xmath26 is very much different in the look [ equation in the appendix ] , and most importantly this equation is _ not _ form - invariant .    with this knowledge , we therefore look for material properties that result in the matching of the coefficients of the two equations ( i.e. and ) .",
    "we find that if we choose the following material parameters    [ eq5 ] @xmath27    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 then between equation and all terms that include 4th order derivatives ( i.e. highest order appearing in these equation ) , all 3rd order , 2nd order and 1st order terms match perfectly except two extra terms in the transformed equation which are factors of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "intrestingly , these extra terms go to zero if the penetration depth is small ( see eq . in the appendix ) .",
    "alternatively , these two extra terms can be handled with a material that is pre - stressed in the radial direction ( i.e. @xmath33 ) with a radial body force ( i.e. @xmath34 ) according to    @xmath35    with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the above cloak for flexural waves is a rigorously derived _",
    "( i.e. efficiency is theoretically unity ) and _ broadband _ cloak .",
    "we now move to the next level by designing an approximate adoption of this perfect cloak restricted by more physical constraints that make achieving such a cloak even easier in an experimental setting .",
    "specifically , the goal is to find an approximate adoption of our cloak that only requires _ concentric layers of homogeneous material _",

    "these two sub - layers can be shown through homogenization that provide the required orthotropic properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in implementing the cloak , since according to the rigidities go unbounded at the inner boundary , a small offset is introduced such that the rigidity of the first layer ( next to @xmath40 ) is calculated at this offset distance from the inner boundary .",
    "this offset can be shown to be equivalent of transforming a region of @xmath41 to the cloaking region @xmath42 [ see eq . and in the appendix ] . in the numerical simulations that follow ,",

    "in order to numerically solve the thin plate s equation with flexural rigidity as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] , we use the spectral method with fourier expansion in the azimuthal direction and bessel functions in the radial direction . assuming time harmonicity of @xmath46 , the solution in each layer is therefore expressed as @xmath47 .",

    "since the governing equations for flexural waves are not form - invariant , the traditional cloak design methodology through linear transformation optics scheme does not apply here .",
    "we therefore employed a nonlinear transformation and matched , term - by - term , the transformed equation with the true governing equation for an inhomogeneous and orthotropic plate equation .",
    "we showed rigorously that the resulting cloak is perfect .",
    "we also presented an adoption of our perfect cloak obtained under more restrictive physical constraints that make the design more amenable for experimental investigations .",
    "these constraints are that cloak can only include a finite number of concentric layers of homogeneous materials and that only modulus of elasticity can be variable from layer to layer .",

    "* ) . the nonlinear transformation proposed here ,",
    "may be applied for other types of the waves to soften the required material properties .",
    "for instance , in electromagnetism , with this nonlinear cloak , we can remove one degree of the freedom and keep permeability ( permitivity ) as a constant in cloaking for transverse magnetic ( electric ) waves .",
    "assuming an orthotropic and inhomogeneous plate , under pure bending and in the absence of in - plane forces , we have @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the bending moments , @xmath3 is the density of the plate , @xmath2 is the thickness and @xmath46 is the frequency of the wave . bending moments @xmath74 and @xmath75",
