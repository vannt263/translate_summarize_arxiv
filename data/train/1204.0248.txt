    "we are interested in planar lattice polygons @xmath3  not least for their own sake  and , for a finite field @xmath4 , the toric codes @xmath5 that they determine .",
    "we recall the construction of such codes , following hansen  @xcite , in section  [ sec : codes ] below .",
    "briefly , @xmath3 and @xmath6 together determine a @xmath7 integer matrix  the toric code  for integers @xmath8 , the _ dimension _ , and @xmath9 , the _ block length_. the important invariant of a code @xmath10 is its _ minimum distance _",
    "@xmath11 , the shortest hamming distance between any two distinct points of the image of the matrix  that is , the distance between points of the lattice generated by the rows of the matrix .",
    "it is this measure which limits the ability of the code to detect and correct errors .",
    "the collection of all toric codes includes some champions among linear codes , in the sense that they have minimum distance greater than that of any other known code with equal block length and dimension .",
    "this is exemplified by the paper of joyner  @xcite and the recent paper of little  @xcite , the latter describing a generalised champion @xmath12$]-code over @xmath13 ( we follow the standard notation and denote the invariants of a code by a triple @xmath14 $ ] ) .",
    "we find a new champion , a @xmath0$]-code over @xmath1 , however the novel part of our paper is the systematic approach to classification of polygons that we use to discover this example .",
    "this approach exploits database methods in collaboration with computer - aided polygon computations in a way that seems not to have been pursued in this area . as a spin - off",
    ", we classify a certain set of ` small ' lattice polygons , as we now explain .",
    "one of the key points when considering toric codes over @xmath4 is to restrict attention to polygons @xmath3 that lie in a square of side - length @xmath15 . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on fields @xmath4 with @xmath16 a prime power , and so we first enumerate all polygons that lie in a square of side - length @xmath17 .",
    "we regard two polygons @xmath3 and @xmath18 as equivalent if there exists a point @xmath19 and change of basis @xmath20 of the underlying lattice such that @xmath21 .",
    "table  [ tab : summary ] summarises our results by listing the number of integral polygons ( up to equivalence ) that lie in the square @xmath22 \\times [ 0,m]$ ] , but not in a smaller square",
    ". it also lists the maximum number of vertices that such a polygon can have , and the number of polygons that achieve this upper bound .",
    "the complete list of polygons is available on the webpage  @xcite .",
    "the systematic approach described above would certainly exhaust all toric codes over small fields ( even the generalised codes of  @xcite ) , but it obviously becomes less practical as @xmath23 increases .",
    "it is remarkable to us that the number of polygons grows as slowly as it does , although this is presumably an artefact of two dimensions .",
    "we seek champion codes , that is , codes exceeding the current largest known minimum distances . computing the minimum distance",
    "is very often too hard ( it is certainly computable , but in many cases we have reliable estimates of computation time of the order of a year ) , but determining whether or not a given code is a champion is much easier : in most cases , simple linear combinations of the rows of the corresponding matrix provide sufficiently short vectors to rule it out .",
    "we carry out this calculation for each one of these polygon codes for every applicable field of size at most nine . in this early part of the polygonal classification ,",
    "there is exactly one champion ",
    "the code mentioned above  as well as many examples that match the current best known minimum distance .",
    "all but 257 of the polygonal codes have a short vector that is a combination of at most three rows of the generator matrix ; only six of these , other than the champion , require more than four rows .",
    "our thanks to john cannon for practical help with adapting minimal distance algorithms and for providing magma for use on the imperial college mathematics cluster , to andy thomas for technical assistance , and to the referees for several interesting suggestions .",
