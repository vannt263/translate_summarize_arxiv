    "the sdd mass coverage is presently limited to some 10 gev . with the zero degree calorimeter ( zds ) , this could be reduced to smaller masses , in case the sdd system produces very forward neutrals , i.e. like a @xmath9 decaying into a fast leading neutron .",

    "the forthcoming measurements at the lhc urge a relevant theoretical understanding and treatment of low mass dd , which essentially has both spectroscopic and dynamic aspects .",

    "their discrimination is a difficult experimental task , and theoretical predictions of the appearance of the resonances depending on @xmath11 and @xmath12 is also very difficult since , as mentioned , perturbative qcd , or asymptotic regge pole formula are of no use here . with this paper",

    "one more important point : the advantage of using the dual - regge model with non - linear regge trajectory presented in this paper over a one - to - one account for the particular resonances is that it automatically takes care of the relative weight of each resonance , and extrapolates to higher masses , with a limited number of resonances on any trajectory .",

    "[ fig:5 ] we show the energy dependence of the double differential cross section for several fixed values of @xmath13 and @xmath10 .",
    "the rise of @xmath175 is mainly determined by the supercritical pomeron intercept @xmath176 , and only weekly affected also by the details of the @xmath177 dependence of the pomeron trajectory .",
    "the double differential cross sections as a function of @xmath13 for two representative lhc energies and several fixed values of @xmath10 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "[ fig:4_1 ] shows the @xmath13- dependence of the differential cross section integrated in @xmath7 for representative lhc energies .",
    "let us briefly summarize the status of the present model and its credibility , including the way its parameters were fixed . as already mentioned , the normalization constant , @xmath29 , discussed in secs .",
    "[ s2 ] and [ sdd ] is absorbed by the overall norm @xmath42 , together with the other normalization paremeter @xmath43 .",
    "the parameters of the pomeron trajectory were determined @xcite from @xmath23 elastic and total cross section data .",
    "the form and the values of the parameters of the proton trajectory , that plays a crucial role in predicting the @xmath10 dependence , are fixed by spectroscopic data , see sec .",
    "[ sec : trajectory ] . finally the overall norm @xmath42 is fixed from the comparison of calculated sdd cross section with the experimental data , with the following caveat : in the present model , applicable at the lhc , only the pomeron trajectory contributes in the @xmath13 channel . at much lower energies ( fermilab , isr , ... ) , where data are available , apart from the pomeron , secondary , non - leading trajectories contribute as well .",
    "we plan to included these in a future , more refined , study .",
    "there is some freedom in the form and weight of the background .",
    "its relative contribution can only be normalized to earlier measurements at the isr or the fermilab .",
    "for a better control , we compare our predictions with the experimental data @xcite and theoretical estimates @xcite . in any case",
    ", it follows from our model and the fits to the data that the background is fairly large : about @xmath178 at the lhc .",
    "a dedicated study of various options for the background in sdd can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the elastic contribution , @xmath179 is usually calculated and measured separately .",
    "there is no consistent theoretical prescription of any smooth transition from inelastic to elastic scattering , corresponding to the @xmath63 limit for the structure functions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    there is an important point omitted in this short paper , namely unitarity .",
    "as is well known ( see , e.g. @xcite ) any simple regge pole model violates unitarity in the sense that the dd cross section asymptotically grows faster that the total cross section ( it is obvious that no partial cross section can overshoot the total cross section ) .",
    "this long - standing problem was cured in various ways , the final answer being still open . in refs .",
    "@xcite unitarity is restored by a renormalization procedure . without entering into details , here",
    "we only mention that a possible solution of this problem can be found by using a more realistic ( and complicated ) pomeron singularity , for example in the form of a double pole @xcite .",
    "the model presented in this paper and the calculated cross sections , corrected for the efficiencies of relevant detectors will be used @xcite in future measurements at the lhc .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , the prospects of measuring sdd at the lhc are promising , although some detail still remain to be settled .",
    "for the cms collaboration , the sdd mass coverage is presently limited to some 10 gev .",
    "together with the t2 detectors of totem , sdd masses down to 4 gev could be covered , provided the totem trigger ( data acquisition ) system will be combined with the cms ones .",
    "alice and lhcb have different beam arrangements , but their acceptances for central diffraction ( double pomeron exchange ) was also investigated ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "measurements of the sdd events at the lhc are based on : ( 1 ) identifying a gap in forward rapidities in conjunction with a veto for any activity on the opposite side of the interaction point , or ( 2 ) detecting a diffractively scattered proton in a leading proton detector , such as the roman pots , and a coincident diffractively excited bunch of particles on the opposite side .",
    "the problem with both measurement strategies stems from the incomplete rapidity coverage of the base line detector systems at the lhc : the low mass , @xmath180 gev , diffractively excited states are not seen . without extra rapidity coverage below m = 4 gev , both approaches to sdd identification",
    "fail . in case of purely rapidity gap based method",
    ", the recorded cross section misses the sdd events with diffractive masses below 4 gev . in case a leading proton",
    "is detected on one side of the intersection point ( ip ) , one could , in principle , be sensitive to diffractive masses that correspond to the uncertainty in lhc beam energy . in practice ,",
    "it is impossible to trigger for these events , and the low mass sdd events will be missed by this method as well .",
    "detecting sdd events with high acceptance is essential for determining the total pp cross section in the so called luminosity independent method based on using the optical theorem .",
    "the method bases on measuring the slope of the elastic cross section , extrapolating the slope to the optical point .",
    "together with the over - all inelastic rate ( plus the ratio between the inelastic and elastic forward scattering amplitudes ) , the total pp cross section is obtained .",
    "the main uncertainty in this evaluation is due to the error in estimating the inelastic pp event rate . as shown by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , the acceptance of basically all the lhc experiments can be substantially improved by adding forward detector systems ( forward shower counters , fscs ) that register secondary interactions within the beam pipe due to particles - both electrically neutral and charged - emitted at very small scattering angles with respect to the beam direction . with the addition of fscs , rapidity coverage of an lhc experiment",
    "can be extended down to sdd masses of the order of 1.2 gev , i.e. down to the dominant n * states .",
    "fscs are being currently installed in alice and cms detectors , and they will provide the necessary added coverage of small mass forward systems at the lhc .",
