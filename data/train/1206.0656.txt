    "are observed , and these high - quality datasets are a treasure trove for asteroseismology studies @xcite . in the first four quarters of the _ kepler mission _  a survey for pulsating stars was made , and a total of 113 compact - pulsator candidates were checked for variability @xcite .",
    "the survey was extremely successful with respect to subdwarf - b ( sdb ) pulsators , with discoveries including one clear v361hya  pulsator @xcite , a total of thirteen v1093her  stars @xcite .",
    "preselection of _ kepler _  targets based on their photometric and spectroscopic properties has provided us with the most outstanding photometric lightcurves in the history of astronomy for a host of known pulsator types .",
    "in addition , the large archive of _ kepler _  data , mostly obtained for detecting exoplanets , provides an inexhaustible source of spectacular lightcurves of all kinds of variable stars , and unlimited opportunities for exciting new discoveries .",
    "here we present one such .",
    "it was included in the color - selected sample of white - dwarf - pulsator candidates that provided the only v777her pulsator in the _ kepler _  field ( kic8626021 * ? ? ?",
    "however , the spectrum obtained in that survey placed it well outside of the known pulsator ranges , and it was not considered further . by chance , it was observed by _",
    "kepler _ as an exoplanet target , permitting serendipity to trump our otherwise pinpoint - precision survey strategy .",
    "our spectrum shows that kic1718290  is technically a hot subdwarf of the sdb type , as it appears as a b - type star with a rather high surface gravity , placing it below the main sequence in the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "however , its surface gravity is lower and its helium abundance is much higher than the majority of the sdbs , making it quite unusual .    after ascending the red - giant branch ( rgb ) most stars with main - sequence masses less than @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 will undergo a core - helium flash and end up by the red clump , where they spend @xmath6@xmath9myr burning helium in the core , before ascending the asymptotic - giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "if such stars suffer significant mass loss , then they will appear bluer after helium ignition while still having roughly the same luminosity .",
    "this produces the distinctive feature seen in color - magnitude diagrams of globular clusters , known as the horizontal branch ( hb ) .",
    "hb stars possess a hydrogen - burning shell , whenever the hydrogen envelope contains @xmath10@xmath11@xmath8 .",
    "stars with thinner envelopes will reside on the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) @xcite .",
    "other hb stars are often designated as either red or blue , with rhb stars encompassing the red clump and the notable class of rrlyrae pulsators .",
    "these are classical radial pulsators excited by the same heat mechanism acting in the partial ionization zone of he@xmath12/he@xmath13 that also drives pulsations in cepheids and @xmath14scuti stars @xcite .",
    "the bhb stars include all stars of spectral type a and b up to the start of the ehb at @xmath2=5 .",
    "the distribution of stars along the hb is a convoluted function of mass loss on the rgb , overall metallicity , and interactions with a close companion .",

    "whereas the majority of the sdb stars on the ehb are members of short - period binaries ( * ? ? ?",

    "we explored the background pixels surrounding the target in the pixel apertures to see if any trace of a pulsation signature could originate from bd+36@xmath223529 , but found no significant signal in the frequency range where kic1718290  displays its features .",
    "after extracting the long - cadence light curves from quarter 1 through 5 , we subtracted out the slow trends introduced by the varying contamination from the neighbouring star with low - order polynomials and rapidly - decaying exponentials for the leading slope that often occurs during the first days after the spacecraft has reacquired the field .",

    "thus , as pointed out by @xcite , what is known as the second newell gap from studies of globular clusters @xcite is neither a forbidden region on the bhb nor due to selection effects , but rather a very underpopulated region that coincides with the position where the envelope has the critical mass required for hydrogen - shell burning . explaining the exact process that produces the gap remains a challenge .",
    "as one proceeds from this gap towards the redder part of the hb it becomes exceedingly hard to distinguish between field - horizontal - branch - b stars and main - sequence - b stars , but high - resolution spectroscopy can distinguish their peculiar chemical composition and low rotation rates @xcite .",
    "we have shown that kic1718290  is spectroscopically an intermediate - helium - sdb star , most likely associated with the bhb .",
    "photometric data of extremely high precision and coverage obtained with _ kepler _  have revealed a pulsation spectrum with a clear period spacing of @xmath1s , indicative of a core - helium burning star similar to the v1093her  pulsators .",
    "there is no reason to believe that the driving mechanism responsible for exciting the pulsations in kic1718290  is any other than the same @xmath135-mechanism that drives the pulsations in the v1093her  and v361hya  stars @xcite .",
    "the red edge of the v1093her  instability strip has never been firmly established , due to the sharp drop in the number of observed ehb stars at around @xmath136k .",
    "v1093her  pulsations in stars at the blue tip of the bhb should not really come as a big surprise , as early models for these stars predicted pulsations at the cool end of the ehb and beyond @xcite .",
    "kic1718290  must have suffered extreme mass loss during its evolution in order to reach its present configuration . while our sed",
    "fit displays no sign of any main - sequence companion , a white - dwarf companion is not excluded .",
    "the _ kepler _  photometry rules out any close object , since a period of @xmath137d or less would be readily detected from doppler beaming in the light curve , unless the orbit is seen face on @xcite .",
    "white - dwarf companions with orbits @xmath6@xmath138d are harder to detect with _ kepler _  due to the monthly data - download cycle , and the reacquisition of the field after each such manoeuvre introduces trends in the data that must be filtered out .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up observations are being undertaken , but have not yet provided any stronger limits than can be determined from photometry .",
    "we conclude that we have observed @xmath0-mode pulsations in a star at the blue end of the classical horizontal branch that are driven by the same @xmath135-mechanism as in the v1093her  pulsators and slowly - pulsating main - sequence - b stars .",
    "the pulsations are of longer period and lower maximum amplitude than has been observed in any of the _ kepler _",
    "v1093her  targets , making this type of pulsator practically undetectable with ground - based observations . in analogy with the naming sdbv for the group consisting of v361hya  and v1093her  pulsators , we propose to call kic1718290  and similar bhb variables for bhbv stars .",
    "the rarity of bhb stars at similar temperatures will make it hard to find other examples of such pulsators in the limited field - of - view of _",
    "kepler_. however , the question of how far towards the red along the bhb @xmath0-mode pulsations may extend remains a question to be explored .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge the _ kepler _  team and everybody who has contributed to making this mission possible .",
    "funding for the _ kepler mission _  is provided by nasa s science mission directorate .",
    "spectroscopic observations were made with the william herschel telescope located at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( orm ) , the nordic optical telescope also at the orm , and the steward observatory 2.3-m bok telescope .",
    "this research has received funding from the european research council under the european community s seventh framework programme ( fp7/20072013)/erc grant n@xmath139227224 ( prosperity ) , as well as from the research council of ku  leuven grant goa/2008/04 ."
