    "measuring the comoving space density of the star formation rate ( sfr ) as a function of cosmic epoch is one of the key issues concerning the study of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the current picture is that the star formation peaked at @xmath15 , and then declined by roughly an order - of - magnitude to the present day ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    among the most direct indicators of the instantaneous sfr in galaxies",
    "is the  @xmath16 recombination line ( @xcite ) .  can be observed in the optical in the local universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , at @xmath17 , it must be observed in the near infrared ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or other less direct sfr indicators such as the doublet must be used .    compared to , is only indirectly coupled to the ionizing continuum from massive stars , and is more sensitive to variations in metal abundance , excitation , and dust attenuation .",
    "nevertheless , because of its intrinsic strength and blue rest - frame wavelength ,  remains a good alternative sfr indicator for high - redshift galaxies ( @xcite ) . in the past decade , a number of investigators have measured the star formation rate density , @xmath18 , at high redshift by studying the  luminosity function ( lf ) , either using spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or narrow - band imaging ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter ly07 ; @xcite , hereafter takahashi07 ) . unfortunately , these studies have been hampered by small sample size , small volume probed , and an inconsistent treatment of dust obscuration .",
    "methods like narrow - band imaging also suffer from difficulties in continuum subtraction and contamination from other emission lines .    to circumvent these issues",
    ", we measure the luminosity function at @xmath14 using data from the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe 2 survey ( deep2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "deep2 has obtained high - resolution spectra for @xmath19 objects over four separate fields , making it the largest existing spectroscopic redshift survey of galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "we use these data to measure the luminosity function in four redshift bins at @xmath0 .    in @xmath202",
    ", we briefly describe our sample and the method used to calculate the lf . in  3 and  4",
    "we present the observed lf and its evolution with redshift , respectively .",
    "finally , in @xmath205 , we compute @xmath18 in several redshift bins centered around @xmath14 , and we summarize our principal conclusions in @xmath206 .    throughout this work ,",
    "we adopt a @xmath21 cosmology with @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "all magnitudes are on the ab system .",
    "we select our sample from the deep2 third public data release ( dr3 ) , which includes @xmath25 photometry and spectra for @xmath26 galaxies in four widely separated fields .",
    "the high - resolution ( @xmath27 ) spectra , which were acquired using the keck - ii / deimos spectrograph @xcite , span @xmath28  .",
    "we thus restrict our analysis to the redshift range @xmath29 , where  is measurable .",
    "to study the evolution of the   lf , we further split each bin into four additional redshift bins : @xmath30 ; @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ; and @xmath33 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for additional details regarding the deep2 survey .",
    "in addition to the flux cut , @xmath34  mag , the deep2 team applied the following color cuts to preselect galaxies at @xmath35 in fields 2 , 3 , and 4 : @xmath36    in the extended groth strip ( egs , field 1 ) , to test their sample preselection method , the deep2 team did not apply the @xmath25 color cuts .",
    "however , in order to make all four fields consistent , here we apply the color cuts given by equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) to the redshift and photometric catalogs in the egs field .",
    "we apply additional angular cuts to avoid survey edges and to exclude gaps in the spectroscopy .",
    "our final catalog contains @xmath37 objects , of which @xmath38 have accurate redshifts ( quality @xmath39 or @xmath40 as defined by @xcite ) .",
    "the areas of the four fields are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , and the total area is @xmath45 .",
    "next we describe how we derive the integrated luminosity for each galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , the deep2 spectra are not flux - calibrated ; therefore we infer the luminosity by multiplying the rest - frame emission - line equivalent width ( ew ) measured in the optical spectra , by the continuum luminosity around @xmath46   inferred from fitting the @xmath25 photometry .",
    "this method has the advantage that it is insensitive to the absolute calibration of the optical spectra .",
    "however , the @xmath47 wide slit in the deep2 survey may not enclose all the line - emitting regions in the galaxy , thus this method does assume that the relative intensity of star formation and stellar light inside and outside the slit does not vary significantly . without spatially resolved spectroscopy ,",
    "however , this assumption is difficult to test directly .    to measure the emission - line ew",
    ", we model each component of the  doublet simultaneously using two gaussian profiles , constrained to have the same intrinsic velocity width and a fixed wavelength separation , and use a smooth @xmath48-spline to estimate the continuum level around . dividing the total flux by the detected continuum yields the rest - frame ew ( ) in  .",
    "we then fit the broad - band @xmath25 photometry at the known redshift to obtain the best - fitting spectral energy distribution ( sed ) using the deep_kcorrect routine in kcorrect ( v4.1.4 ; @xcite ) . finally , we multiply the ew by the flux - density of the best - fitting sed at @xmath46   to obtain the integrated luminosity . because the effective wavelengths of all the @xmath25 filter bandpasses lie blueward of @xmath49   above @xmath50 , this technique does require extrapolating the best - fitting sed beyond the effective @xmath51-band wavelength to estimate the @xmath46   continuum luminosity for the galaxies in our highest redshift bin ; however , the uncertainty introduced by this extrapolation is negligible .",
    "our measurement technique is similar to that used by the deep2 team ( @xcite ) , although the procedures used to compute @xmath52-corrections are totally independent .",
    "a comparison of our measurements shows no systematic differences and a @xmath12 scatter , which is comparable to the typical measurement error .",
    "we also checked our work by replacing our measurements with theirs , and obtained consistent results . in the following analysis",
    "we use our measurements .",
    "we consider an measurement with signal to noise ratio ( @xmath53 ) larger than @xmath54 as reliable . in detail ,",
    "our results are not sensitive to the specific @xmath53 cut used since it only affects weak  detections , for which we are incomplete anyway .",
    "for example , using @xmath55 has no significant effect on our conclusions .",
    "our final sample of -emitting galaxies contains @xmath56 objects .      to calculate the luminosity function",
    ", we use the non - parametric @xmath57 method @xcite . for a given galaxy ,",
    "we calculate : @xmath58}{dz } f(z ) \\mathrm{,}\\ ] ] which is suitable for a spatially flat universe .",
    "the angular integral is limited to the deep2 area , @xmath59 is the comoving distance as defined by @xcite , and @xmath60 expresses the probability of selecting each galaxy in our sample .",
    "we assume that @xmath60 is given by the product of four quantities : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the rate at which a source of a given @xmath63-band magnitude and @xmath64 and @xmath65 color was targeted [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ] , @xmath66 is the rate at which a redshift was successfully measured , @xmath67 is the fraction of deep2 spectra where the wavelength coverage includes the redshifted line , and @xmath68 is a step function , which we determined using the @xmath25 magnitudes and the @xmath53 , as described below . we experimented with including the galaxy surface brightness as a fifth variable in the completeness function ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but found that it did not significantly affect our measured lfs .    for a given galaxy ,",
    "we calculate @xmath69 using a monte carlo method ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we randomly choose 1200 values of redshift @xmath70 between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , uniformly distributed in volume .",
    "for each redshift , we calculate what the magnitudes of the object would be using deep_kcorrect .",
    "to estimate the @xmath53 at each mock redshift , we first determine the mean noise spectrum for every deep2 mask .",
    "then , for a given galaxy , we randomly choose a mask and the corresponding noise spectrum and compare the noise at the actual observed wavelength of to that at the simulated wavelength as if the galaxy were at the simulated redshift , and obtain the new @xmath53 .",
    "we then apply the appropriate flux cut , color cuts , @xmath53 cut and the completeness function to determine the fraction of mock sources that would have passed our selection criteria .",
    "finally , @xmath69 is given by the comoving volume multiplied by this fraction .",
    "when determining the completeness function , we assume a @xmath73 redshift success rate for blue galaxies ; that is , we assume that the only targeted blue galaxies without successfully measured redshifts are those for which   falls outside the wavelength range of the spectra , and thus outside the redshift range studied here . here , we define blue galaxies using the same definition as @xcite , who also made the same assumption regarding blue galaxies without well - measured redshifts .",
    "this assumption is especially reasonable in our analysis because a well - detected doublet will always result in a well - measured redshift .",
    "finally , we tested our completeness function by calculating the @xmath48-band lf for all galaxies and comparing with @xcite , and found excellent statistical agreement , and no systematic differences .",
    "we measure the  luminosity function in four redshift bins : @xmath74 ; @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ; and @xmath33 , according to where the doublet could be measured reliably in the deep2 spectra .",
    "the median redshifts of the -emitting galaxies within these four redshift bins are @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , containing @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 galaxies in each bin , respectively .",
    "the resulting  lfs are tabulated in table  [ tbl1 ] and illustrated in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the error bars shown in the figure are @xmath83 confidence poisson upper limits and lower limits estimated using the approximate formulas given by @xcite [ see eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 14 ) in that paper ] .",
    "the distribution of the lf must follow a scaled poisson distribution . to determine the scaling factor , within each luminosity bin",
    ", we define the effective weight ( @xmath84 ) by :    @xmath85\\left/\\left[{\\sum_{i}{\\frac{1}{(v_\\mathrm{max})_i}}}\\right]\\right.~\\mathrm{,}\\ ] ]    and the effective number ( @xmath86 ) of objects by : @xmath87\\left/{w_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\right.~\\mathrm{.}\\ ] ]    we then calculate the upper limit and lower limit for the effective number , and multiply them by the effective weight to obtain the upper limit and lower limit for the luminosity density in each bin . for comparison ,",
    "the square root poisson error gives :    @xmath88    which is commonly used in the literature .",
    "the poisson errors , however , do not include the effects of cosmic variance .",
    "because we have four widely separated fields , we determine the error due to cosmic variance , @xmath89 , by calculating the variance among the four independent fields , and list the results in table  [ tbl1 ] .",
    "examining figure  [ fig1 ] , the commonly used @xcite function is clearly a poor representation of the data .",
    "instead , we model the observed  lf in each redshift bin as a power law :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is @xmath11 in @xmath92 , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "we find the best fitting parameters ( @xmath95 ) using a non - linear least square fit to the  lfs weighted by the average poisson errors .",
    "these parameters are presented in table  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "our results show that the bright part of each lf can be represented by a power law @xmath96 with slope @xmath4 .",
    "the slope for the highest redshift bin is the flattest : @xmath97 .",
    "however , it is possible that the slope in this bin may be underestimated due to incompleteness ( see below ) .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to constrain the faint end of the  lf , especially in the highest redshift bin . because we do not know the intrinsic number of emitters within a certain luminosity bin , we can not calculate the completeness of luminosity directly , but can only infer that from the completeness of broad - band properties . to analyze the completeness , and in particular to test the significance of the observed _ turnover _ ( to ) in the lf ( _ vertical dotted lines _ ; fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , we construct two diagnostic diagrams . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the @xmath98 versus @xmath99 color - magnitude diagram for our sample .",
    "we plot the approximate @xmath48-band completeness limits for blue galaxies as dashed lines , where the sloping color cut has been defined by @xcite , and the thick vertical dashed line roughly corresponds to where the data and the color cut begin to deviate . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we plot the density distribution of points in the @xmath100 plane in grey scale ; the two contours enclose @xmath101 and @xmath102 of the points , respectively .",
    "the thin dashed lines in this figure all have a slope of @xmath103 .",
    "this slope is formally consistent with performing a mean ordinary least square fit to the data ( @xcite ) . for our purposes",
    ", we note that the line roughly bisects the distribution of points in each panel , i.e. , it approximates the median relation between @xmath11 and @xmath99 .",
    "the thick horizontal dashed lines in each panel are equivalent to the thick vertical dashed line plotted in the respective panels in figure  [ fig2 ] , and the vertical dotted lines give the position of the turnover in the respective  lf ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the majority of the galaxies missing from our sample should be along and to the left of the thin dashed line .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] demonstrates that , brighter than the turnover , we expect the sample to be complete because the majority of the unobserved galaxies below the @xmath104 completeness limit are along and to the left of the thin dashed line .",
    "fainter than the turnover , the sample becomes increasingly incomplete . in the two lowest redshift bins ,",
    "the turnovers appear to be significant , because fainter than the turnover the difference between the measured lf and the extrapolation of the power law fitted to the bright part of the lf is so significant that it is unlikely to be due to incompleteness .",
    "in the two highest redshift bins , however , because the @xmath104 completeness limit is very bright , it is possible that the turnovers are artificial , caused by the incompleteness of the survey . in the highest redshift bin ,",
    "the @xmath104 completeness limit is so bright that the slope of the lf may be even steeper than we have derived .",
    "to summarize , we are unable to constrain the faint end of the  luminosity function .",
    "however , we emphasize that the evolutionary analysis presented in @xmath105 is unaffected by our inability to constrain the faint - end slope , because we restrict our analysis to the bright part of the lf where we are statistically complete . in @xmath106 , when integrating the lf to obtain an estimate of the sfr density , we do make some simplified assumptions regarding the form of the faint end of the lf .    in figure",
    "[ fig4 ] , we compare our results at @xmath50 with three other recent coeval measurements of the lf based on narrow - band observations ( ly07 , takahashi07 ) .",
    "using subaru / nb816 narrow - band imaging of the @xmath107 subaru deep field ( sdf ) by @xcite , ly07 and takahashi07 identified @xmath108 and @xmath109 -emitting galaxies , respectively . in the @xmath110 cosmic evolution survey field",
    "( cosmos ; @xcite ) , takahashi07 used the same narrow - band filter to identify @xmath111 -emitting galaxies at @xmath50 @xcite . over the range of luminosity where all the surveys are complete , @xmath112",
    ", we find that our lf from deep2 agrees very well with the luminosity functions derived by ly07 and takahashi07 in the sdf and cosmos fields , respectively .",
    "it is not clear why the lf of the sdf derived by takahashi07 is so discrepant with the other surveys , although cosmic variance may play a role .",
    "nevertheless , this comparison shows that : ( 1 ) our assumptions regarding the faint - end slope are reasonable ; and ( 2 ) the bright end of the  lf is clearly a power law , not a schechter function .",
    "the uncertainty in the faint end of the lf prevents us from obtaining a reliable estimate of the total  luminosity density .",
    "therefore , we focus instead on the integrated number density , @xmath113 , of the strongest -emitting galaxies . assuming that the turnover luminosity in the highest redshift bin is @xmath114",
    ", we integrate our model of the lf in each redshift bin over @xmath115 , and present the results in the top panel of figure  [ fig5 ] and in table  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "the horizontal error bars indicate the range of each redshift bin , and the vertical error bars are given by the cosmic variance among the four fields , which dominate the error budget .",
    "we find that the total number density of the strongest -emitting galaxies , i.e. , those with @xmath116 , declines by a factor of @xmath5 between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "a linear fit to the four points gives a slope of @xmath119 dex per unit redshift :    @xmath120 = a~z - b \\mathrm{,}\\ ] ]    with @xmath121 = @xmath122 and @xmath123 in @xmath124 .",
    "this fit is shown as the dashed line in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "the observed decrease in the number density of -emitting galaxies may be caused by the decline of the overall number density of galaxies in the universe , or by the evolution of the luminosity function itself .",
    "we attempt to constrain the amount of evolution by measuring the luminosity at a fixed space density ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we define a characteristic luminosity , @xmath8 , where the space density equals @xmath125 , which has the advantage that it is independent of the faint end of the lf .",
    "we show @xmath8 as a function of redshift in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig5 ] , and list the results in table  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "once again , the vertical error bars are dominated by cosmic variance .",
    "we find that @xmath8 declines by a factor of @xmath126 between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "we perform a linear fit to the four points and obtain a slope of @xmath127 dex per unit redshift :    @xmath128    with @xmath129 = @xmath130 and @xmath11 in @xmath92 .",
    "the resulting fit is shown as the dotted line in figure  [ fig5 ] .    to summarize , we find that the total number density of the strongest -emitting galaxies has declined by a factor of @xmath131 between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , when the universe aged from @xmath132  gyr to @xmath133  gyr .",
    "this decline may be driven by a decline in the overall number density of galaxies in the universe , or by a fading of the lf .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to establish whether number - density evolution , luminosity evolution , or a combination of both is responsible for the observed evolution .",
    "nevertheless , if we assume that the observed change in the lf is predominantly due to luminosity evolution , that @xmath11 is proportional to the sfr ( see @xmath106 ) , and that the typical dust attenuation in galaxies at fixed luminosity does not change significantly over @xmath0 , then this result implies that the sfr in galaxies declines by @xmath12 per gyr during this epoch . in the next section",
    "we integrate the full lf using some simple assumptions , and compare our results with other estimates of the sfr density at @xmath14 .",
    "converting the observed luminosity into a sfr is subject to considerable random and systematic uncertainties , arising from variations in dust attenuation , metallicity , and excitation among star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our measurement of the luminosity function affords a valuable opportunity to constrain the sfr density of the universe during an important epoch of cosmic history .    in a recent analysis , @xcite showed that dust reddening , as derived using the / balmer decrement , is responsible for the bulk of the scatter in as a sfr indicator , while variations in metallicity and excitation are second - order effects for most galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , the deep2 spectra do not span a sufficiently wide wavelength range to include , , and other emission - line diagnostics of the metallicity and excitation .",
    "therefore , we use the empirical correlation derived by @xcite between the absolute @xmath48-band magnitude , and the @xmath11/sfr ratio .",
    "this calibration statistically accounts for the gross systematic effects of reddening , metallicity , and excitation , all of which correlate with optical luminosity , and has been shown to work reasonably well for star - forming galaxies at @xmath134 @xcite .",
    "note that an sfr conversion that is independent of luminosity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would severely underestimate the sfr , because luminous , star - forming galaxies tend to be dustier and more metal - rich @xcite .",
    "another potential concern is that some fraction of the emission might be arising from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) rather than star formation .",
    "although the agn - sensitive / ratio @xcite lies in the near - infrared at @xmath135 , agn that contribute significantly to the optical emission - line spectrum also can be identified using /.",
    "in the deep2 spectra , / is measurable for galaxies at @xmath136 , comprising roughly one - third of the sample in our lowest redshift bin . among these objects",
    ", we find @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) with @xmath139/@xmath140 , indicative of agn activity .",
    "we can also leverage deep x - ray observations of the egs to identify agn @xcite . among the @xmath141 galaxies in this field ,",
    "we find that @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) are also x - ray point sources .",
    "these results reveal that powerful agn constitute a negligible fraction of the sources in our sample .",
    "however , even if we have significantly underestimated the fraction of agn in our sample , detailed studies show that the physical conditions in the narrow - line regions of agn in the local universe disfavor emission , which is one advantage of using as a sfr tracer @xcite .",
    "indeed , we will show below that our -based estimate of the sfr density at @xmath144 agrees remarkably well with other multi - wavelength studies .",
    "therefore , we conclude that agn contamination is a negligible source of error on our results .    before integrating the observed  lf to derive the sfr density , @xmath18",
    ", we must make some assumptions regarding the form of the faint end of the lf ( see @xmath145 ) .",
    "first , we allow the luminosity of the turnover in the lf in each redshift bin to vary over a sensible range of values to account for the uncertainties in our completeness .",
    "specifically , for the two lowest redshift bins , we assume @xmath146 = @xmath147 and @xmath148  @xmath92 , respectively , while for the two highest redshift bins , we adopt a fainter lower limit : @xmath146 = @xmath149 and @xmath150  @xmath92 .",
    "second , we must assume a form for the  lf fainter than the turnover luminosity .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) have assumed that the  lf is a schechter function , which is a power law at the faint end . however , the faint - end slope , @xmath151 , is usually not well - constrained .",
    "consequently , hereafter we allow @xmath151 to vary between @xmath152 and @xmath153 , which brackets the value , @xmath154 , that we measure from the lowest redshift bin in figure  [ fig1 ] . for comparison",
    ", @xcite assumed a faint - end slope of @xmath155 for the @xmath48-band lf of blue galaxies at @xmath156 .    to summarize , we assume that the  luminosity function is a double power law with slope : @xmath157 where @xmath93 is derived from our fit to the bright part of the lf where we are complete .",
    "given these assumptions , we integrate the observed lfs and list the results in table  [ tbl2 ] .    instead of using the @xmath48-band luminosity of each individual galaxy , we obtain a statistical estimate of @xmath104 for each object from @xmath11 using the thin dashed line in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we then calculate the appropriate @xmath11/sfr conversion factor by interpolating table  2 in @xcite to derive the sfr .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] compares our measurements of @xmath18 at @xmath14 against a large compilation of multi - wavelength measurements from the literature by @xcite .",
    "our results agree remarkably well with these independent measurements considering the uncertainties in converting @xmath11 into a sfr , and our incompleteness at the faint end of the lf .",
    "because its blue rest - frame wavelength and intrinsic strength allow it to be measured up to @xmath158 in the optical , the  doublet plays a unique role in the study of galaxy evolution .",
    "we have used spectroscopy of @xmath1 galaxies from the deep2 galaxy redshift survey to measure the  luminosity function at @xmath159 .",
    "our sample is orders - of - magnitude larger than previous spectroscopic studies , over a considerable larger area spanning four independent fields , allowing us to minimize the systematic effects of cosmic variance .",
    "our principal results are given in tables  [ tbl1 ] and [ tbl2 ] , and illustrated in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "we found that the bright part of the  lf is well - represented by a power law @xmath96 with slope @xmath4 .",
    "however , survey incompleteness prevented us from constraining the faint end of the lf .",
    "we measured the evolution of the  lf using two quantities that only rely on the bright part of the lf where we are statistically complete .",
    "first , we calculated the total number density of galaxies with @xmath160 , and found that it has declined by a factor of @xmath131 between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "second , we calculated the characteristic luminosity , the luminosity where the space density of -emitting galaxies equals @xmath161 , and found that it has declined by a factor of @xmath10 over the same redshift interval . assuming that the  luminosity is proportional to the sfr",
    ", these results imply that the sfr in galaxies declined by @xmath162 per gyr during this epoch .",
    "finally , we used the empirical calibration between @xmath11 and sfr published by @xcite , and adopted some simple assumptions regarding the faint end of the lf , to obtain an estimate of the integrated sfr density , @xmath18 , in four redshift bins centered around @xmath14 .",
    "we found that , despite the considerable uncertainties , the evolution we measure is consistent with previous measurements based on a variety of independent , multi - wavelength sfr indicators .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank jeffrey a. newman , david w. hogg and the anonymous referee for numerous comments that helped improve the manuscript .",
    "we would also like to thank benjamin j. weiner for sharing his  measurements for comparison , and for pointing out that the variation in the wavelength coverage of the deep2 spectra must be included in our estimate of the completeness function .",
