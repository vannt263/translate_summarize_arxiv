    "block copolymers ( bcp ) are heterogeneous polymers where each polymer chain is composed of several chemically distinct homopolymer blocks , connected together by a covalent bond .",
    "these polymeric systems exhibit fascinating structures in the nanometer scale and can be created by self - assembly from solutions or the melt state @xcite .    in addition , bcp are composite materials that have many applications .",
    "for example , by connecting together a stiff ( rod - like ) block with a flexible ( coil ) block , one can obtain a material which is rigid , but not brittle @xcite .",
    "moreover , the interplay between flexibility and toughness can be controlled by temperature .",
    "different chain architecture ( ring or star - like ) may lead to novel mechanical and flow properties @xcite .",
    "in addition , bcp have many industrial uses because the length scales involved are smaller or comparable to the wavelength of light .",
    "these applications include waveguides , photonic band gap materials and other optoelectronic devices @xcite and dielectric mirrors @xcite",
    ".    our prime concern in this mini - review are melts of bcp above the glass transition .",
    "however , it is worthwhile mentioning that bcp also exhibit interesting properties upon cooling below the glass transition into a solid state .",
    "some bcp may undergo crystallization of one or more components that is accompanied by strong structural changes , while other bcp systems stay in the vitrified state upon cooling .    in the molten state ,",
    "because of competition between enthalpy and entropy , at high temperatures the bcp melt behaves as a disordered fluid , while at low temperatures the macroscopic phase separation is hindered because the two ( or more ) immiscible sub - chains can not be detached from each other as they try to phase separate due to block incompatibility .",
    "hence , bcp s phase separate into a variety of micro - ordered structures , with characteristic size depending on the bcp chain length and other system parameters @xcite .",
    "the morphology and structure of the prevailing phase depend on the lengths of constituent sub - chains ( also called blocks ) , the chemical interactions between the blocks , the temperature and the chain architecture .",
    "the bcp micro - domain size ranges from about @xmath0 to several hundreds nanometers .    a typical example of a well - studied di - bcp , polystyrene - polyisoprene ( ps - pi ) , is shown in fig .",

    "alignment of confined lamellae by external electric fields is studied in sec .",

    "this electrostatic tendency can be used to overcome interfacial interactions with the bounding electrodes and align structures in a desired direction .",
    "let us consider first a simple free energy expression for a / b di - bcp melt . with the definition of the order parameter @xmath1 as the local deviation of the a monomer concentration from its average , the bulk free energy can be written as @xcite : @xmath2 @xmath3 is the fundamental periodicity in the system , and is expressed by the polymer radius of gyration @xmath4 through @xmath5 .",

    "the existence of dissociated ions means that there are additional _ forces _ which act in the alignment process of the bcp meso - phases .",
    "these forces depend on the mobility @xmath157 of the ions , and on the frequency @xmath174 of applied field .",
    "the torque due to mobile ions is expected to be large if the drift velocity @xmath175 is larger than the bcp domain size @xmath176 .",
    "in addition , mobile charges also mean that there is _",
    "dissipation_. hence , the energy stored in the dielectric medium @xmath177 should be compared to the joule heating in one cycle of the field @xmath178 , where @xmath31 is the ions conductivity , proportional to the ion density .",
    "it is clear from the above that for low frequencies ( in practice @xmath179 hz ) mobile dissociated ions begin to play an important role in bcp alignment and phase transitions @xcite .",
    "when the additional complexity due to this ions is taken into account , it turns out that the orientation forces ( torques ) due to the mobile ions scale as @xmath180 @xcite , and are equal to the ones due to the regular `` dielectric mechanism '' at about @xmath181 hz .",
    "consequently they are twice as large at @xmath182 hz , and they become more important as the frequency is reduced .    taking into account the effect of mobile ions on the bcp phase transition",
    "as outlined above ( from bcc phase of spheres to a hexagonal array of cylinders ) , it turns out that the transition field @xmath165 can be significantly reduced from a value of @xmath183-@xmath184v/@xmath157 m to values @xmath185v/@xmath157",
    "we review in this paper several ordering mechanisms in confined bcp s .",
    "the theoretical approach relies on a mean - field coarse - grained hamiltonian , which is less sensitive to microscopic details and valid for a wide class of system showing self - assembly in soft - matter .",
    "this approaches thus complements other computationally - intensive self - consistent numerical schemes @xcite and monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the polymer density near a chemically patterned surface is given above the order - disorder temperature as a function of the surface pattern .",
    "in this regime the chemical pattern @xmath22-modes give rise to density modes which are decoupled from each other ( linear response theory ) . in the weak segregation regime ,",
    "the surface correlations are long range and , therefore , simple chemical patterns yield complex copolymer morphology , even though the bulk is in its disordered phase .    below the odt temperature , we consider lamellae confined by homogeneous surfaces , and examine the relative stability of parallel vs. perpendicular ordering as a function of temperature , surface separation and interfacial interactions .",
    "lamellae confined by striped surface whose periodicity is larger than the lamellar periodicity appear tilted with respect to the surface thereby optimizing their surface interactions .",
    "the lamellar undulations are more prominent as the odt is approached .",
    "mixed lamellar phases appear when one surface has chemically patterns in the form of stripes while the other is uniform .",
    "a different paradigm for control of bcp orientation in thin films is using rough surfaces .",
    "this method may be advantageous over other methods in several situations since it is relatively simple to implement experimentally .",
    "the phase diagram is presented for the ordered phases as a function of surface period , surface amplitude , and lamellar period , as well as other parameters .",
    "lastly , the influence of electric field on the phase behavior of bcp s is considered .",
    "an external electric field favors a state where dielectric interfaces are perpendicular to the field itself .",
    "hence , lamellae confined in a thin - film are electrostatically preferred perpendicular rather than parallel to the confining electrodes . in the weak - segregation regime , there is one critical field at which parallel layers are transformed into perpendicular ones . even for fields larger than the critical field ,",
    "the long - range effect of the surfaces is evident as strong lamellar undulations .",
    "the strong segregation regime is considered as well . here",
    "we find three possible states : parallel , perpendicular and mixed .",
    "the last morphology exhibits few parallel layers close to the electrodes while the rest of the film is perpendicular .",
    "there are either two or one critical fields separating them , depending on the interfacial interactions .",
    "an external electric field can also bring about a phase transition in ordered phases , if they are frustrated and can not eliminate dielectric interfaces perpendicular to the field direction .",
    "the transition from the bcc phase of spheres to a hexagonal array of cylinders under the influence of electric field is discussed as an example . below the critical field",
    "the spheres elongate in the field s direction , but above it we find perfect cylinder whose axes are parallel to the field .",
    "the phase diagram of the various meso - phases is calculated , and the simple analytical expression obtained with the coarse - graining theory is compared with a more rigorous scf theory , with rather good match .",
    "we point out that residual dissociated ions in bcp s can greatly enhance the electric field effect , and this is specially true in low - frequency electric fields .",
    "the analytical calculations presented here rely on a relatively simple mean - field coarse - grained free - energy functional .",
    "this approach allowed us to deal with confinement effects in bcp , take into account the chemical nature of the surfaces , calculate the elastic energy penalty and lamellar conformation near curved interfaces and balance the electrostatic energy against the elastic one for bcp s in electric fields .",
    "the coarse - grained approach has a big advantage that it can be generalized and account for other complex polymer systems . because it is less accurate in terms of quantitative predictions , it is useful to compare this approach with numerical self - consistent field theories , discrete lattice models , monte - carlo and molecular dynamics simulations and experiments .",
