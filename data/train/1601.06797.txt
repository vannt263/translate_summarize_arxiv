    "these methods involve analyzing the amount of emission received at different velocities and different galactic longitudes . here , we make similar predictions for the hot gas absorption line profiles , but assuming different underlying hot gas density and velocity profiles compared to the neutral hydrogen distribution .",
    "the primary difference here is the assumption that the hot gas is a volume - filled distribution of material extending to the milky way s virial radius as opposed to only being confined to the galactic disk .",
    "similarly , we explore different large - scale velocity profiles for the hot gas that deviate from simple corotating motion with the disk .",
    "these factors imply that different density and velocity profiles produce unique line shapes and line center shifts for different @xmath24 coordinates .",
    "we explore these effects and estimate their impact on current and future absorption line measurements .",
    "we make several assumptions for the hot gas density , temperature , and metallicity distribution based on previous observational and theoretical analyses .",
    "most of these assumptions are based on the results from @xcite , and we refer the reader to these studies for a more detailed description . here , we outline the most important assumptions and any caveats in terms of how they could affect our absorption line profile calculations .",
    "we assume the hot gas density distribution follows a modified spherical @xmath21-model extending to the milky way s virial radius .",
    "the @xmath21-model has the following functional form :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the core density , @xmath27 is the core radius , and @xmath21 controls the slope at @xmath28 .",

    "although simple , is not arbitrarily chosen , and has successfully reproduced several milky way hot gas observables .",
    "most recent studies on the milky way s hot gas structure follow a general methodology .",
    "one assumes one of two types of underlying density distributions : an exponential disk with scale height of 5 - 10 kpc , or a lower - density , spherical model extending to the virial radius . given a model choice ,",
    "one compares model observations to measured observations and determines if the model is consistent with the data .",
    "the primary observables of the milky way s hot gas are and absorption and emission line strengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several analyses argue that an exponential disk - like morphology can reproduce the line strengths for _ individual _ sight lines @xcite .",
    "however , independent analyses on all - sky samples of absorption and emission line strengths suggest a density model like equation  [ eq.beta_model_approx ] reproduces the global line strength trends better than a disk - like morphology @xcite . additional work by @xcite explored more sophisticated spherical , extended density models ( an adiabatic profile and a cuspy nfw profile ) and an exponential disk model to compare with other observed constraints , such as the residual pulsar dispersion measure toward the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) @xcite and ram - pressure stripping of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they found the spherical , extended models were consistent with these constraints , while the exponential disk model was not .",
    "therefore , an extended , spherical density morphology appears to be consistent with several observed hot gas properties , and a simple power law can reproduce how the observed line strengths vary across the sky .    the @xmath21-model is also used for fitting the observed x - ray surface brightness profiles around nearby galaxies .",
    "this has historically been done for @xmath2350 early - type galaxies , with fitted @xmath21 values ranging between 0.4 - 1.0 for a typical early - type galaxy @xcite .",
    "more recently , there have been detections of diffuse x - ray halos around massive ( @xmath910 times larger than the milky way ) late - type galaxies within @xmath970 kpc @xcite .",
    "although there are only four late - type galaxies where these coronae are detected , their fitted @xmath21 values are also comparable to the results from early - type galaxy surveys .",
    "this further motivates our initial choice to use a @xmath21 model as our underlying milky way hot gas density profile .",
    "we also assume that the hot gas temperature , oxygen abundance , and metallicity are constant with radius .",
    "observationally , the milky way s hot gas temperature is inferred from a combination of fitting soft x - ray background ( sxrb ) spectra with thermal plasma models , or comparing the to absorption line ratio in individual sight lines where both lines are detected .",
    "both methods indicate that the hot gas temperature is @xmath34 k , with the latter method providing the most current observational constraints .",
    "@xcite fit the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band of 110 sxrb spectra with multiple thermal apec plasma models to measure the milky way s hot halo emission measure and temperature distribution .",
    "the found the halo gas temperature shows little variation across the sky with a median value of @xmath35 k and interquartile region of @xmath36 k. the fact that this value is consistent across the sky implies the gas is close to isothermal .",
    "therefore , we assume a constant halo gas temperature of @xmath37 k , resulting in an ion fraction of 0.5 @xcite .",
    "there is less certainty when considering the hot gas metallicity and oxygen abundance since there are no direct observational constraints on these values .",
    "the reported solar oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen has varied in the literature , but we assume a value of 5.49 @xmath38 10@xmath39 @xcite .",
    "galaxy evolution simulations suggest halo gas metallicities can range between @xmath230.05 - 2 @xmath40 depending on the stellar feedback prescription , with a typical value of @xmath230.3@xmath40 @xcite . this is consistent with the model - dependent constraint @xcite placed on the hot gas metallicity in order to not overproduce the pulsar dispersion measure in the lmc direction , @xmath41 .",
    "@xcite also estimated a model - dependent hot gas metallicity profile by comparing their emission line fitting results ( sensitive to @xmath42 ) with absorption line results ( sensitive to @xmath43 ) from @xcite .",
    "they found evidence for a shallow metallicity gradient of @xmath44 with @xmath45 at @xmath46 = 10 kpc , although the uncertainty in the relation was consistent with a constant gas metallicity .",
    "thus , we assume a constant metallicity value of 0.3@xmath40 , which still results in @xmath250% of the absorption coming from @xmath25 kpc of the sun and @xmath290% coming from @xmath2950 kpc @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that these hot gas distribution assumptions are all broadly consistent with the theoretical prediction that the hot gas formed via an accretion shock and is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the milky way s dark matter potential well .",
    "our density parametrization of a power law is the simplest functional form that can remain in hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter potential well at large radii , with @xmath21 = 0.5 implying the gas should be close to hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "given this type of distribution and formation mechanism , one expects the gas temperature to be close to the galactic virial temperature of 2 @xmath38 10@xmath14 k. this prediction is consistent with the observed , and therefore assumed hot gas temperature .",
    "the global hot gas distribution adopted here has a reasonable theoretical basis , and is also consistent with multiple types of observations .    finally , our calculations depend on several milky way parameters that have been measured from different techniques . for the milky way s size and geometry , we assume a solar distance to the galactic center of @xmath47 = 8.34 kpc , a solar rotation velocity around the galactic center of @xmath48 = 240 km s@xmath6 @xcite , and an average virial radius of @xmath49 = 250 kpc @xcite .",
    "the former do not affect our overall line shapes , but act as a net shift in wavelength / velocity space for the line profiles .",
    "we extrapolate our model profiles and calculations to @xmath50 , however gas within @xmath2350 kpc of the sun dominates our column densities and equivalent widths @xcite .",
    "this implies that our choice for @xmath50 has a negligible impact on our results , and that our model profiles are explicitly valid within @xmath2350 kpc .",
    "we consider bulk rotation motion , radial inflow / outflow , and flows perpendicular to the galactic disk for our velocity profiles .",
    "a net rotational flow ( denoted as the @xmath51 direction henceforth ) is expected if the gas has residual angular momentum from the milky way s formation .",
    "the radial and perpendicular flows ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 directions ) are considered as a net accretion of material onto the galactic disk or a net ejection of material from the galactic disk .",
    "we assume constant flow velocities as a function of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , or @xmath46 , depending on the flow type , where @xmath54 is the distance from the rotation axis , @xmath55 is the distance perpendicular to the galactic plane , and @xmath46 is the galactocentric radial distance .",
    "these are represented by the following equations :    @xmath56     + @xmath57 + @xmath58    where @xmath59 follows a flat rotation curve similar to the disk , and @xmath60/@xmath61 are net flows in the @xmath52/@xmath53 directions respectively . therefore , positive @xmath60/@xmath61 values assume flows away from the galactic center ( @xmath60 ) or galactic plane ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we also consider models with a constant mass inflow / outflow rate by allowing @xmath62 to not be a constant .",
    "the mass flux depends on the density and radial velocity , and is represented by the following equation :    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the mass density as a function of radius .",
    "if @xmath65 , this implies @xmath66 in order for @xmath67 to be constant .",
    "optical depth effects and the assumed absorption line doppler width play an important role when inferring column densities from measured equivalent widths . the observed absorption lines are never broader than the instrumental line widths of current x - ray spectrographs ( the chandra low - energy transmission grating has a fwhm of @xmath230.05   ) .",
    "this sets an upper limit on the doppler width of @xmath29550 km s@xmath6 . given these spectral resolutions , it becomes difficult to quantify deviations from an optically thin plasma .",

    "the resultant density - weighted lsr velocities create the asymmetric line profiles and significantly broader lines compared to the stationary plasma results .",
    "for example , the corotating model line width ( defined as the full width at half the line depth ) for the @xmath24 = 90@xmath92 , 0@xmath92 direction in figure  [ figure.line_detail ] is 326 km s@xmath6 compared to 200 km s@xmath6 for the stationary model , a 63 % increase . furthermore , the absorption line centroids depend on the underlying velocity profile ( vertical dotted lines in figures  [ figure.line_grid ] and [ figure.line_detail ] ) .",
    "the stationary plasma halo produces the strongest deviations from the rest wavelength , or 0 km s@xmath6 , since all of the absorption is at the same velocity .",
    "if the gas is corotating with the disk , one expects weaker line shifts since dense gas near the galactic disk produces @xmath1020 km s@xmath6 absorption , while gas futher in the halo produces absorption at @xmath103100 km s@xmath6 .",
    "flows in the @xmath46 or @xmath55 directions produce similar net velocity shifts , although flows in these directions have stronger effects near the galactic center , anti - center , and poles .",
    "these effects imply that the hot gas kinematics produce observable signatures on the absorption line centroids , and alter the inferred conversion between measured equivalent width and column density .",
    "these line of sight velocity effects have important consequences when analyzing the absorption line strengths .",
    "specifically , these effects impact observable quantities ( equivalent widths , resolved line profiles , etc . ) and how we infer the gas column density .",
    "this is not a new concept in the broad field of absorption line analysis , but these large scale velocity flows have never been considered when analyzing the milky way s absorbers . here , we discuss how these effects impact current line strength interpretations when the lines are unresolved and potential future analyses if the lines can be partially resolved .    modeling the line of sight velocity flows and corresponding line profiles leads to a more accurate conversion between measured absorption line equivalent widths and the inferred column densities .",
    "the measured equivalent widths are currently the best way to measure the absorption line strengths since the lines are unresolved by current x - ray spectrographs .",
    "the inferred column densities are usually determined from a curve of growth analysis with various assumptions for the plasma optical depth .",
    "velocity flows alter this conversion by spreading out the absorption in velocity space , producing larger equivalent widths for a given column density . to quantify the strongest velocity corrections , we generate model line spectra in the @xmath24 = 90@xmath92 , 0@xmath92 direction , for a range of column densities and doppler @xmath5 values , and for a corotating halo .",
    "we vary the column density by changing the halo normalization parameter in equation  [ eq.beta_model_approx ] , thus keeping the gas distribution the same with @xmath21 = 0.5 .",
    "we create curves of growth with velocity effects by calculating equivalent widths for each line profile / column density .",
    "figure  [ figure.cog_corr ] shows these new growth curves , where the solid lines represent traditional curve of growth calculations with no velocity effects and the opposite edges of the shaded regions represent our curves of growth with rotational velocity effects .",
    "therefore , the shaded regions represent the range of possible velocity corrections , depending on the true halo velocity structure .",
    "these velocity effects have a significant impact on the inferred column densities , with potentially large deviations from optically thin values . here , we examine corrections to the inferred optically thin column densities with and without considering velocity effects and for different @xmath5 values .",
    "the right hand panel of figure  [ figure.cog_corr ] rescales the curves of growth in the left hand panel into the ratio between the true and optically thin column density for a given equivalent width .",
    "the doppler @xmath5 value plays a critical role when inferring the correct column density for a given measured equivalent width , where corrections without velocity effects range between @xmath2350% to over an order of magnitude for @xmath5 between 45 and 150 km s@xmath6 and a typical equivalent width measurement of 20 m  .",
    "the velocity effects discussed above mitigate these differences , but still cause significant deviations from optically thin values .",
    "for example , the ratio between the true and optically thin column ranges from a factor of @xmath232 if the halo has is corotating to a factor of @xmath235 without velocity effects for @xmath5 = 85 km s@xmath6 and a 20 m  equivalent width .",
    "this implies that velocity effects result in _ smaller _ column densities than would be inferred from a traditional curve of growth conversion .",
    "these results are useful in the current limit where the lines are unresolved , but there are alternative approaches if the lines are partially resolved",
    ".    a useful approach for future analyses on these absorption lines will be the apparent optical depth method @xcite . in this method",
    ", one decomposes the observed line profile into an apparent optical depth function @xmath104 and converts this into an apparent column density function @xmath105 , which can be integrated to determine a total column density .",
    "this method makes no assumption for the underlying line of sight density or line of sight velocity profile , but it would be useful to reconstruct a column density distribution similar to our figure  [ figure.los_structure ] .",
    "the reason this method is not used in current analyses on the absorbers is because : 1 ) the lines need to be at least partially resolved ( fwhm(instrument ) @xmath29 2fwhm(line ) ) and 2 ) it requires multiple lines of the same species with different @xmath106 products to estimate saturation effects .",
    "the lines are completely unresolved with current x - ray telescopes and detecting the k@xmath21 transition at 18.63   is difficult because it is intrinsically weaker than the k@xmath3 transition and there is an rgs instrumental feature near the transition",
    ". thus , this method will be useful if we obtain absorption line observations with a higher resolution spectrograph ( see section  [ subsection.future ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the milky way s hot gas kinematics produce signatures in the intrinsic absorption line shapes and centroids .",
    "bulk velocity flows in the disk rotation direction along with a net inflow or outflow of gas can produce strong asymmetrical line shapes and significant line centroid deviations from the the absorption line rest wavelength .",
    "these results alter the conversion between equivalent widths and column densities , producing significant deviations from both optically thin and zero velocity assumptions , but also imply the line shapes ( not currently observable ) and observed centroids encode information on the milky way s hot gas kinematics .",
    "the new velocity considerations presented here motivate future analyses on the milky way s hot gas structure and kinematics .",
    "the model line calculations presented in this paper form the basis for the @xcite analysis on the milky way s hot gas kinematics .",
    "their non - parametric statistical tests concluded that the observed line centroid measurements were inconsistent with a stationary hot gas profile ( a result not requiring additional modeling or assumptions for the gas distribution ) , whereas corotating model centroids from calculations in section  [ subsection.line_profile ] were more consistent with the data .",
    "figure  [ figure.center_maps ] shows their observed centroid distribution on the sky with maps of the model line centroid distributions for the stationary and corotating profiles to illustrate how the models compare with the data .",
    "they also used parametric modeling techniques with @xmath59 as a free parameter to show that a velocity profile lagging behind the disk with @xmath59 = 183 @xmath107 41 km s@xmath6 is most consistent with the observed line centroid distribution .",
    "the @xmath108 and @xmath109 flow parameters were also included , but the constraints were within 1@xmath110 of 0 km s@xmath6 .",
    "these results are the first constraints on the milky way s @xmath1010@xmath14 k gas kinematics , and they depend on the absorption line profile calculations presented here .",
    "the inferred velocities also have implications for other inferred hot gas properties , such as the density distribution and metallicity .",
    "significant hot gas rotation velocities can change the net potential well affecting the hot gas , resulting in a flattened or `` bow - tie '' morphology .",
    "the prediction of hot , extended coronae around late - type galaxies is based on the assumption that the shock - heated gas exists in hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter potential well .",
    "if the dark matter distribution is approximately spherical on large galactic scales and the gas is isothermal , hydrostatic equilibrium implies a spherical power law distribution for the hot gas :          where @xmath117 is an arbitrary radius for normalization , @xmath118 is the angular rotation profile , and @xmath119 is the effective potential ( see equation ( 8) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . inserting the effective potential into equation  [ eq.hydrostatic ] for flat rotation curves can alter the initial spherical profile into a flattened morphology .",
    "to visualize this effect , we calculate an effective potential profile for a static potential and flat rotation curve we impose on the gas .",
    "we assume the static potential includes a dark matter nfw profile @xcite with a scale radius of 12 kpc and virial mass of @xmath120 @xmath98 and a thin stellar disk profile with scale radius of 3.2 kpc and total surface density of 536 @xmath98 pc@xmath121 @xcite .",
    "these assumptions do not account for the triaxiality of the milky way s dark matter distribution @xcite and the vertical structure of the stellar disk , but these calculations are meant to show the characteristic effect that rotation has on the hot gas .",
    "we also point out that the baryonic components contribute very little to the potential for @xmath122 kpc , implying the details of their assumed profile do not significantly affect our calculations .",
    "the results of these calculations for a stationary halo and a modest flat rotation curve of @xmath59 = 100 km s@xmath6 are seen in figure  [ figure.flat_rot ] .",
    "one sees that the isodensity contours are constant with @xmath46 for the stationary halo , but become flattened with the inclusion of rotation .",
    "we also point out that these calculations and general results are consistent with those found by @xcite , who estimated these same effects of coronal rotation on the underlying morphology .",
    "in contrast with these model predictions , several observation - based lines of evidence suggest the milky way s hot gas distribution is not significantly flattened . as discussed in section  [ subsection.model_assumptions ] ,",
    "analyses on large samples of line strength measurements , pulsar dispersion measures , and x - ray surface brightness measurements suggest a spherical morphology can better reproduce these observables than a disk - like morphology .",
    "in particular , the models considered in @xcite included a flattened , extended distribution .",
    "however , the model fitting results for this flattened model ( with an additional parameter and thus one less degree of freedom ) were not a significant improvement in fitting the data compared to a spherical model .",
    "the analysis showed that a flattened halo was not required to fit the line strength measurements .",
    "also , observations of hot gas in other galaxies do not indicate rotation significantly impacts their morphologies .",
    "the examples discussed in section  [ subsection.model_assumptions ] found that the extended x - ray halos around both early- and late - type galaxies are typically fit well with spherical @xmath21 models .",
    "additional analyses on higher - resolution x - ray images of early - type galaxies indicate any x - ray observed ellipticity does not correlate with the galaxies rotation velocities , implying rotation does not drive their morphologies @xcite .",
    "thus , the balance of observational evidence suggests the extended hot gas distributions around the milky way and other galaxies is approximately spherical .",
    "the observed line centroids from @xcite combined with the models outlined in section  [ subsection.line_profile ] lead to the robust result that there is global kinematic structure in the hot gas , regardless of the assumed density profile .",
    "this appears to be a valuable first step in this type of analysis , especially since there is little observational or theoretical background for the expected kinematic structure of this gas phase .",
    "the line profiles presented here are designed to highlight how we can learn about the milky way s hot gas kinematics , and show how the hot gas kinematics can potentially impact the inferred hot gas structure .",
    "one example of how these line profile calculations can improve constraints on the hot gas structure is with a more accurate conversion between measured equivalent width and the column density .",
    "the velocity calculations presented in section  [ subsection.equivalent_widths ] imply that velocity flows modify the curve of growth analysis depending on the observed direction .",
    "thus , one needs to account for bulk velocity flows to infer an accurate column density from a measured equivalent width .",
    "these effects have not been considered in previous analyses of the milky way s hot gas , and impact inferred hot gas properties .    as an example application of the improved equivalent width - column density conversion",
    ", we examine the hot gas metallicity based on the observed equivalent width toward the lmc direction and the hot gas dispersion measure in this direction .",
    "we convert the observed equivalent width for the lmc x-3 x - ray binary into column densities for different @xmath5 values with and without velocity effects .",
    "these column densities are then converted to dispersion measures , which depend on the gas metallicity , and compared to the observed residual hot gas dispersion measure toward the lmc direction .",
    "the dispersion measure is the integral of free electrons along the line of sight , @xmath123 , which relates to the column density as follows :      where @xmath125 is the ion fraction , @xmath126 is the fixed solar oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen @xcite , and @xmath127 is the gas metallicity .",
    "thus , we infer an average hot gas metallicity by equating the inferred dispersion measure from the measurement to the independently observed value .",
    "the inferred metallicity depends on an accurate conversion between the observed equivalent width and true column density , which we calculate above , and the residual dispersion measure due to hot gas .",
    "for the latter , analyses on lmc pulsars suggest the milky way s hot gas contributes 23 @xmath17 pc to the total observed dispersion measures @xcite .",
    "independent analyses report a consistent equivalent width for the lmc x-3 spectrum , with @xcite suggesting a value of @xmath128 m  and @xcite suggesting a value of @xmath129 m  ( 90% confidence regions ) . here",
    ", we use a more current measurement with improved calibration from the @xcite analysis , @xmath130 m .",
    "we also assume all of the absorption arises from the milky way s hot gas distribution , as opposed to a distribution associated with the lmc or intrinsic to the lmc x-3 x - ray binary .",
    "this appears to be a valid assumption since the centroid is inconsistent with the lmc systemic velocity ( @xmath9300 km s@xmath6 ) or the x - ray binary escape velocity ( @xmath910@xmath131",
    "km s@xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "we convert this equivalent width to a column density using our curves of growth for the lmc direction , a range of plausible @xmath5 values , and assuming either a stationary or corotating halo .",
    "we then use equation  [ eq.dm ] to convert these to dispersion measures for different metallicities .",
    "figure  [ figure.lmc_dm ] shows the lines where the calculated dispersion measure equals 23 @xmath17 pc .",
    "there are several key results to note from the calculations represented in figure  [ figure.lmc_dm ] .",
    "increasing the @xmath5 value decreases the column density required to match the observed equivalent width .",
    "therefore , increasing the @xmath5 value requires a decrease in metallicity in order to match the observed dispersion measure . for a stationary halo ,",
    "the transition between solar and sub - solar metallicity occurs at @xmath5 = 130 km s@xmath6 .",
    "including velocity effects broadens the line profile in this direction , which further reduces the column density required to match the observed equivalent width .",
    "the transition between solar and sub - solar metallicity is at 100 km s@xmath6 in this case .",
    "for both the stationary and corotating cases , the metallicity approaches a limit of @xmath230.6@xmath40 as @xmath5 increases beyond 200 km s@xmath6 .",
    "these results imply that the gas metallicity should be @xmath20.6@xmath40 if @xmath5 is less than the sound speed , but also that @xmath132 100 km s@xmath6 if the gas metallicity is not greater than solar .",
    "this analysis provides important constraints on the average hot gas metallicity along the lmc sight line , however it also illustrates how the halo gas kinematics can impact inferred hot gas properties .",
    "these velocity considerations have important applications for future analyses on the milky way s hot gas structure .",
    "we have discussed several problems and initial attempts to solve them , such as the milky way s hot gas kinematic structure , the relation between the hot gas kinematics and density structure , and how to accurately interpret current hot gas observables . here",
    ", we discuss strategies to solve these issues in the future , and highlight how our velocity calculations will be useful .    we can better constrain the milky way s hot gas kinematic structure by targeting sight lines that predict the largest differences between model line centroid values .",
    "these regions provide the most leverage when validating or excluding different types of velocity flows . as an example",
    ", the upper - right panel in figure  [ figure.center_maps ] shows the absolute difference between the predicted line centroids for a stationary and corotating halo .",
    "clearly , the regions near @xmath7 = 90@xmath133 and 270@xmath133 show the largest differences of @xmath2100 km s@xmath6 , while regions near the galactic pole and anticenter have differences of @xmath230 km s@xmath6 .",
    "although we do not show a map with a @xmath109 or @xmath108 flow , the galactic pole and anticenter are ideal locations to probe those effects since rotation produces a negligible shift in these regions .",
    "we also point out that a rotating gas profile predicts a distinctive line centroid feature near the galactic center , in that the centroid switches sign for @xmath134 30@xmath133 .",
    "it is possible that this effect could be observed , although the galactic center is a complex region with other kinematic features due to the fermi bubbles @xcite .",
    "regardless of these complications , these models should be used to motivate the most informative observations .",
    "interpreting current and future absorption line observations requires a better estimate for the plasma optical depth , or @xmath5 value .",
    "figure  [ figure.cog_corr ] indicates optical depth effects and line of sight kinematics introduce significant corrections to the equivalent width - column density conversion .",
    "the plasma @xmath5 value is usually determined by the k@xmath21 to k@xmath3 ratio , but weak k@xmath21 detections introduce systematic uncertainties in the inferred hot gas structural parameters @xcite .",
    "one way to progress through this issue in the near future is with more sophisticated radiative transfer models .",
    "monte carlo radiative transfer methods @xcite are a promising avenue for these improvements since the codes predict both emission and absorption line strengths for an assumed plasma density profile and @xmath5 value .",
    "typical radiative transfer codes are not designed for analyses on the milky way s hot gas distribution , specifically with its extended geometry and our proximity embedded inside the distribution .",
    "we are currently developing a special radiative transfer code accounting for these geometric effects and the gas kinematic structure to model the plasma radiation field and resultant line strengths .",
    "future projects with this code involve joint fits of the line strengths and shapes , resulting in improved estimates on the hot gas optical depth , structure , and kinematics .",
    "these techniques allow us to maximize the information we have from current x - ray observations , but we can gain significantly more information from future x - ray telescopes .",
    "an x - ray spectrograph with higher spectral resolution than current x - ray spectrographs will yield significantly improved constraints on the milky way s hot gas structure .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ rgs and future missions , such as _ athena _ and _ astro - h _ , can not resolve the absorption lines with spectral resolutions of @xmath135300 - 400 near 0.6 kev @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic line widths and deviations from gaussian line shapes are sensitive to how @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 depend on @xmath54 , @xmath46 , @xmath55 , implying these spectrographs can not probe these signatures .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ figure.resolution ] shows the stationary and corotating line profiles from figure  [ figure.line_detail ] convolved with a model rgs line spread function ( @xmath136 320 ) , where any line asymmetry or velocity broadening due to kinematic effects is lost due to the low resolution ( the difference in line widths is only @xmath2320 km s@xmath6 in this case ) .",
    "alternatively , technology exists for x - ray grating spectrographs with @xmath1363000 in the soft x - ray band @xcite . at this spectral resolution ,",
    "kinematic signatures , such as the velocity broadening and line centroid , are much clearer and easier to detect compared to current absorption line observations .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ figure.resolution ] illustrates this improvement , where we convolve the same intrinsic line profiles discussed above with an @xmath54 = 3000 lorentzian line spread function ( the rgs line spread function is close to , but not a perfect lorentzian ) .",
    "thus , an improved x - ray spectrograph will provide significantly more information on the hot gas kinematics than current instruments .    given these improved observations and tools to interpret them",
    ", we will continue to develop more sophisticated velocity models motivated by galaxy formation predictions .",
    "galaxy formation simulations of milky way - like galaxies predict a diverse range of hot gas kinematic structures depending on the assumed formation mechanism .",
    "the supernova - driven outflow scenario predicts hot gas rotational velocities comparable to the disk and @xmath137100 km s@xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the shock - heated coronal gas scenario predicts a largely hydrostatic halo , but with significant rotational velocities ( @xmath2100 km s@xmath6 ) near the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "additional complexities include the assumed stellar feedback prescription , the impact of galaxy - galaxy interactions , and the inferred coupling between the hot gas and cooler gas phases . for example , @xcite developed explored the mixing and angular momentum transfer between @xmath138 k galactic fountain gas ejected from the disk and an initially static @xmath1 k corona .",
    "they found the cooler galactic fountain gas can accelerate the hotter coronal gas to velocities 80 - 120 km s@xmath6 slower than the disk , broadly consistent with the results from @xcite .",
    "regardless of this consistency , there still exists many different velocity models that produce distinct absorption line signatures .",
    "future progress involves an iterative approach where velocity models become more complex to reflect a more realistic scenario , but the improved observations continue to validate or exclude different velocity models predicted in simulations . in this way , theory and",
    "observations provide additional information how and when the hot gas obtains its kinematic structure .",
    "the model absorption line results presented here have numerous important applications regarding the milky way s hot gas structure . many of the calculations were simple ideas , but were never applied to the milky way s extended hot gas distribution .",
    "we applied simple kinematic models to absorption line calculations to show what can be observed now , how the gas kinematics can alter our interpretation of current observables , what can be observed in the future , and future strategies for exploring these effects . here , we summarize these results :    1 .   the model line centroid calculations presented here combined with the observed line centroids from @xcite indicate the milky way s hot gas distribution is likely not stationary .",
    "a model velocity profile with significant rotation velocity ( @xmath23180 km s@xmath6 ) is most consistent with the data .",
    "2 .   ordered velocity flows of this magnitude can impact constraints on the hot gas density structure .",
    "line of sight velocity effects alter the conversion between the equivalent width and column density .",
    "the corrections from an optically thin column can range between a factor of @xmath232 to @xmath235 depending on the underlying kinematic structure .",
    "3 .   these flows can alter the underlying density profile into a flattened or `` bow - tie '' morphology as discussed in @xcite .",
    "current observational evidence suggests the milky way s hot gas is approximately spherical , although the data can not conclusively rule out a flattened morphology .",
    "4 .   future observational strategies should focus on the regions with the largest difference between predicted model centroid values . for probing the rotation curve ,",
    "this is near the @xmath7 = 90@xmath133 and 270@xmath133 directions . for probing accretion or outflows ,",
    "this is near the galactic pole or anticenter .",
    "current kinematic constraints are limited by the resolution of x - ray spectrographs .",
    "we show that an x - ray spectrograph with resolving power of @xmath1393000 would begin to resolve the intrinsic line profiles , resulting in significantly better constraints on the hot gas kinematics .",
    "future model line profile calculations should incorporate more detailed kinematic structure derived from galaxy formation simulations , and account for optical depth effects in the plasma with radiative transfer codes . both of these factors play significant roles in the absorption and emission line strength interpretations .",
