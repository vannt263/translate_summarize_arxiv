    "the internal antarctic plateau is , at present , a site of potential great interest for astronomical applications .",
    "the extreme low temperatures , the dryness , the typical high altitude of the internal antarctic plateau ( more than 2500 m ) , joint to the fact that the optical turbulence seems to be concentrated in a thin surface layer whose thickness is of the order of a few tens of meters do of this site a place in which , potentially , we could achieve astronomical observations otherwise possible only by space .    in spite of the exciting first results ( see refs .  , , ) the uncertainties on the effective gain that astronomers might achieve from ground - based astronomical observation from this location still suffers from serious uncertainties and doubts that have been pointed out in previous work ( see refs .  , , ) .",
    "a better estimate of the properties of the optical turbulence above the internal antarctic plateau can be achieved with both dedicated measurements done in simultaneous ways with different instruments and simulations provided by atmospheric models .",
    "simulations offer the advantage to provide volumetric maps of the optical turbulence ( @xmath0 ) extended on the whole internal plateau and , ideally , to retrieve comparative estimates in a relative short time and homogeneous way on different places of the plateau . in a previous paper@xcite",
    "our group performed a detailed analysis of the meteorological parameters from which the optical turbulence depends on , provided by the general circulation model ( gcm ) of the european center for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) . in that work we quantified the accuracy of the ecmwf estimates of all the major meteorological parameters and , at the same time , we pointed out which are the limitations of the general circulation models . in contexts in which the gcms fail , mesoscale models can supply more information .",
    "the latter are indeed conceived to reconstruct phenomena ( such as the optical turbulence ) that develop at a too small spatial and temporal scale to be described by a gcm . in spite of the fact that mesoscale models can attain higher resolution than the gcm , thes",
    "parameters such as the optical turbulence are not explicitly resolved but are parameterized , i.e. the fluctuations of the microscopic physical quantities are expressed as a function of the corresponding macroscopic quantities averaged on a larger spatial scale ( cell of the model ) . for classical meteorological parameters the use of a mesoscale model should be useless if gcms such as the one of the ecmwf could provide estimate with equivalent level of accuracy .",
    "for this reason the hagelin et al paper@xcite has been a first step towards the exploitation of the mesoscale meso - nh model .",
    "we retrieved all what it was possible from the ecmwf analyses and we defined their limitations at the same time .",
    "we concluded that in the first 10 - 20 m , the ecmwf analyses show a discrepancy with respect to measurements of the order of 2 - 3 m.s@xmath1 for the wind speed and of 4 - 5 k for the temperature .",
    "preliminary tests concerning the optimization of the model configuration and sensitivity to the horizontal and the vertical resolution with the meso - nh model have already been conducted by our team for the internal antarctic plateau . in this paper",
    "we present further progress of that work .",
    "more precisely , we intend :    * to compare the performances of the mesoscale meso - nh model and the ecmwf general circulation model in reconstructing wind speed and absolute temperature ( main meteorological parameters from which the optical turbulence depends on ) with respect to the measurements .",
    "this analysis will quantify the performances of the meso - nh model with respect to the gcm from the ecmwf . * to perform simulations of the optical turbulence above dome c employing different model configurations and compare the typical simulated thickness of the surface layer with the one measured by trinquet et al  @xcite  . in this way we aim to establish which configuration",
    "is necessary to reconstruct correctly the @xmath0 .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the three nights presented here exhibit different turbulent conditions .",
    "they show the ability of the model to react and predict the evolution of different surface layers . during the first night ( 2005",
    "july 11 ) the surface layer is constant in time , with a mean forecasted thickness of  82 m ( with the grid - nested simulation , fig .",
    "[ fig : ot]b ) .",
    "the observation for this night@xcite gave a value of 98 m at 14:10 utc . the second night ( 2005 july 25 )",
    "has a forecasted mean surface layer height lower ( with the grid - nested simulation , fig .",
    "[ fig : ot]d ) : 17 m. the observed value was 22 m at 13:53 utc .",
    "the third and last night displayed ( 2005 august 29 ) has a forecasted mean surface layer height of  97 m ( always with the grid - nested simulation , [ fig : ot]f ) .",
    "the observed value for this night was 47 m at 14:47 utc .    in two of these three nights , the thickness of the surface layer retrieved by the model is well correlated with the observed one .",
    "one can notice that for these two nights , the monomodel simulations give higher values than the grid - nested simulations .",
    "the third night shows some interesting variability of the surface layer height , which are not present in the other nights and that is a signature of an evident temporal evolution of the turbulent energy distribution even in conditions of a pretty stratified atmosphere . for this night",
    "meso - nh gives a thickness for the surface layer of around 97 m instead of the observed one ( 47 m ) .",
    "in this paper we studied the performances of a mesoscale meteorological model , meso - nh , in reconstructing wind and temperature vertical profiles above concordia station , a site in the internal antarctic plateau .",
    "two different configurations were tested : monomodel low horizontal resolution , and grid - nesting high horizontal resolution .",
    "the results were compared to the ecmwf general circulation model and radiosoundings .",
    "* we showed that near the surface , meso - nh retrieved better the wind vertical gradient than the ecmwf analyses , thanks to the use of a highest vertical resolution .",
    "more over , the analysis of the first vertical grid point permits us to conclude that , as is , the meso - nh model surface temperature is closest to the observations than the ecmwf general circulation model which is too warm . * the outputs from the grid - nested simulations are closer to the observations than the monomodel simulations .",
    "this study highlighted the necessity of the use of high horizontal resolution to reconstruct a good meteorological field in antarctica , even if the orography is almost flat over the internal antarctica plateau .",
    "the computations estimates from a previous study@xcite are probably affected by the low horizontal resolution they used in their simulations .",
    "* for what concerns the optical turbulence , both configurations predict a mean surface layer height higher than in the observations . however , it is always inferior at 100 m ( when we used the criterion [ eq : bl1 ] of trinquet et al@xcite  ) .",
    "the configuration of meso - nh giving better estimate ( closer to observations ) is in grid - nesting mode . *",
    "the results of meso - nh concerning the computation of the mean thickness of the surface layer are not very dependent of the time interval used to average it .",
    "this widely simplifies the analysis of simulations . *",
    "the criterion used in trinquet et al@xcite appears to be misleading .",
    "indeed , it underestimates the typical thickness of the turbulent surface layer .",
    "we propose the use of another critera ( presented in the last section of the paper ) instead .",
    "it gives a mean value higher of around 15 m for the eleven nights .",
    "this result has an important implication for astronomical application .",
    "it is indeed not so realistic to envisage a telescope placed above a tower of more than 50 m and the use of the adaptive optics remains the unique path to follow to envisage astronomical facilities at dome c.      in this paper we did not present results concerning the seeing .",
    "we will focus our work ahead on this parameter , discriminating between two different partial contributions : the seeing in the free atmosphere , and the seeing of the surface layer .",
    "we plan to make comparisons between meso - nh output and observations .",
    "the study has been carried out using radiosoundings from the progetto di ricerca `` osservatorio meteo climatologico '' of the programma nazionale di ricerche in antartide ( pnra ) , _",
