    "the revolution in very - deep , near - infrared imaging provided by the 2009 refurbishment of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) with the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3/ir ) has enabled the discovery and study of the first substantial samples of galaxies at @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , dunlop 2012 for a review ) . following the instant success of the initial deep @xmath18 udf09 imaging",
    "( go 11563 ; pi : g. illingworth ) of the hubble ultra - deep field ( hudf ; beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) and associated parallel fields ( e.g. oesch et al . 2010 ; bouwens et al . 2010a , 2011 ; mclure et al . 2010 , 2011 ; finkelstein et al . 2010 ; bunker et al .",
    "2010 ) , wfc3/ir has been used to conduct wider - area surveys for more luminous galaxies at @xmath19 , both through the candels treasury programme ( grogin et al .",
    "2011 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ; grazian et al . 2012",
    "; oesch et al .",
    "2012 ) , and through parallel imaging programmes such as the borg survey ( e.g. bradley et al .",
    "most recently , attention has been refocussed on pushing to even fainter magnitudes and still higher redshifts , either with the assistance of gravitational lensing ( e.g. through the clash treasury programme ; zheng et al .",
    "2012 ; coe et al .",
    "2013 ) , or through our own ultra - deep wfc3/ir imaging in the hudf ( go 12498 ; pi : r. ellis , hereafter udf12 ) .    our recently - completed 128-orbit udf12 observations reach 5-@xmath20 detection limits of @xmath21 = 30.0 , @xmath22 = 29.5 , @xmath6 = 29.5 , @xmath23 = 29.5 ( after combination with the udf09 data ) , and are the deepest near - infrared images ever taken ( ellis et al .",
    "a detailed description of the udf12 data - set is provided by koekemoer et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , and the final reduced images will be available on the team web - page .",
    "these new , ultra - deep , multi - band near - infrared images have already yielded the first significant sample of galaxies at @xmath5 , including a possible candidate at @xmath24 ( ellis et al .",
    "the discovery of galaxies at @xmath25 was a key design goal of this programme , and motivated the first inclusion of deep @xmath6 imaging in the hudf ( elsewhere , @xmath6 imaging has also played a key role in enabling clash to yield convincing galaxy candidates out to @xmath26 ; coe et al .",
    "however , the additional deeper @xmath23 imaging , and the ultra - deep @xmath21 imaging has also been crucial in enabling the more robust selection of objects at @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( with improved photometric redshifts ; mclure et al .",
    "2013 ) , and a push to still fainter magnitudes",
    ". another key goal of the udf12 programme was therefore to use the resulting improved samples , coupled with the more accurate 4-band near - infrared photometry , to undertake a new and unbiased study of the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of faint galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is thus focussed on revisiting the study of the rest - frame uv seds of galaxies , and in particular their uv continuum slopes , @xmath7 ( where @xmath27 ; e.g. calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1994 ; meurer et al .",
    "1999 ) , armed with the best - available , near - infrared data required for this measurement at @xmath28 ( and , for the first time , at @xmath5 ) . because the objects uncovered by hst in the hudf at these redshifts are too faint for informative near - infrared spectroscopy with current facilities , a broad - band determination of the uv continuum slope @xmath7 at present offers the only practical way of gaining insight into the rest - frame uv properties of the early populations of galaxies emerging in the young universe .",
    "this ( in principle simple , but in practice tricky ) measurement is of astrophysical interest for a number of reasons .",
    "first , certainly at more modest redshifts , @xmath7 has been shown to be a good tracer of dust extinction in galaxies , as it has been demonstrated to be well correlated with excess far - infrared _ emission _ from dust ( e.g. meurer et al .",
    "1999 ; reddy et al . 2012 ; heinis et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the reason this works is that ( as we again demonstrate later in this paper ) an actively star - forming galaxy of @xmath29 solar metallicity would be expected to display @xmath30 ( @xmath31 zero colour in the ab magnitude system ) in the absence of dust , and so any significant deviation to redder values can be viewed as a signature of significant dust extinction ( albeit the relation between far - infrared dust - emission and uv - derived dust emission is not expected to be perfect , given that different regions of the galaxies might be observed in such widely - separated wavelength regimes ; e.g. wilkins et al .",
    "2012 ; gonzalez - perez et al .",
    "these results have been used to interpret the apparent steady progress towards lower average values of @xmath1 with increasing redshift ( from @xmath32 to @xmath3 ) in terms of monotically - decreasing average dust extinction , with important implications for the inferred cosmological evolution of star - formation activity ( e.g. hathi et al . 2008 ; bouwens et al . 2009 , 2012",
    "; castellano et al . 2012 ; finkelstein et al . 2012 ) .",
    "second , @xmath7 is obviously also a function of age ( see , for example , fig .",
    "2 in rogers , dunlop & mclure 2013 ) , although ( as we explicitly demonstrate later in this paper ) the sensitivity is not very strong for young , quasi - continuously star - forming sources , and very blue values of @xmath7 can certainly only be achieved for very young stellar populations .",
    "third , @xmath7 can be used as an indicator of metallicity .",
    "in practice of course the impact of metallicity and dust extinction can be degenerate for redder values of @xmath7 , but blue values significantly lower than @xmath30 are an indicator of a low - metallicity stellar population . for example ngc1703 , one of the bluest local star - forming galaxies with @xmath33 ,",
    "is generally intepreted as being dust - free , with a significantly sub - solar metallicity ( calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ) , as is the low - mass galaxy bx418 at @xmath34 for which erb et al .",
    "( 2010 ) report @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "fourth , @xmath7 is influenced by the extent to which the emission from the combined photospheres of the stars in a galaxy is ` contaminated ' by nebular continuum .",
    "nebular continuum emission is significantly redder than the star - light from a very young , low - metallicity stellar population ( e.g. leitherer & heckman 1995 ) , and so , given other information ( e.g. stark et al .",
    "2013 ; labb et al .",
    "2013 ) or assumptions , @xmath7 can in principle be used to estimate ( or correct for ) the level of nebular emission in a young galaxy .",
    "this in turn can set constraints on the inferred escape - fraction ( @xmath38 ) of hydrogen - ionizing photons .",
    "it is the rate - density of such photons that requires to be estimated to chart the expected progress of cosmic reionization by young galaxies ( e.g. robertson et al .",
    "2010 ) , but such photons are not directly observable during the epoch of reionization .    thus , as discussed by many authors , there is a strong motivation for attempting to measure @xmath7 as accurately as possible , but the interpretation of the results can clearly be problematic given the degeneracies involved .",
    "interestingly , however , the degree of complication in interpretation is result - dependent .",
    "in particular , as highlighted by schaerer ( 2002 ) and bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , the discovery of _ extremely _ blue values of @xmath39 would offer a fairly clean and powerful result , because such values can only be produced by a stellar population which is simultaneously very young , of extremely low metallicity , dust - free , and also free of significant nebular emission ( corresponding to a very high escape fraction for ionizing photons ) .",
    "since these are exactly the combined properties which might be expected of the first galaxies ( which possibly commenced the reionization of the universe ; e.g. paardekooper , khochfar & dalla vecchia 2013 ; mitra , ferrara & choudhury 2013 ) the measurement of @xmath7 during the first billion years of cosmic time has been a key focus of several recent studies of galaxies at @xmath3 ( bouwens et al .",
    "2010b , 2012 ; dunlop et al .",
    "2012 ; finkelstein et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ; mclure et al . 2011 ; wilkins et al . 2011 ; rogers , dunlop & mclure 2013 ) .    however , as discussed in detail by dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and rogers et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , previous attempts to determine the uv spectral slope at faint magnitudes ( @xmath40 ) have inevitably been afflicted by bias .",
    "the interested reader is referred to these papers for detailed discussions and simulations , but there are three key points to consider , each related to photometric scatter and the resulting impact on derived _ average _ values ( @xmath1 ) .    first , the selection band can bias the result if source selection is pushed to the 5-@xmath20 limit , and the primary selection band is then also involved in colour determination .",
    "for example , imposition of a @xmath22 flux density threshold , as applied by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , inevitably leads to a blue - bias in the derived average value of @xmath1 if @xmath7 is based on @xmath41 colour .",
    "second , the classification of objects as _ robust _ high - redshift lyman - break galaxies can also yield a subtle bias towards bluer values of @xmath7 .",
    "again this is only really an issue for the derivation of average values from individual measurements with substantial photometric scatter .",
    "the point is that , while both colour - colour selection ( e.g. bouwens et al . 2010a , 2011 ) and photometric redshift selection ( e.g. mclure et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) are sufficiently inclusive to include virtually all plausible star - forming galaxy seds at high redshift , photometric scatter can lead to some genuine high - redshift galaxies being misclassified as being at much lower redshift . because this only happens when the scatter yields erroneously red colours , the result can be clipping of the red end of the _ observed _ colour distribution , yielding a blue bias in the derived average @xmath42 .",
    "rogers et al .",
    "( 2013 ) show that this bias is , unsurprisingly , essentially identical for colour selection and photometric - redshift selection provided _ all _ galaxies with a plausible high - redshift photometric solution are retained in the latter approach .",
    "if attention is confined to the most robust photometrically - selected high - redshift galaxies , then the bias is unfortunately inevitably more extreme ( because a very blue colour longward of the putative lyman break essentially guarantees a robust high - redshift solution ; see dunlop et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "third , if , as advocated by finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , @xmath7 is derived from galaxy spectral energy distribution ( sed ) models ( e.g. bruzual & charlot 2003 ; hereafter bc03 ) , the result can be a red bias in @xmath1 . at first sight , the use of galaxy seds seems sensible , but the problem is that model galaxy seds never produce @xmath7 significantly bluer than @xmath39 . while there is good reason to believe that real galaxy seds can never actually yield @xmath7 significantly bluer than @xmath39 , if one wants to compute a population average from a photometrically - scattered set of objects , it is ( as already emphasized ) important not to artificially clip one end of the _ observed _ distribution . in this case",
    "the effect of insisting on fitting plausible galaxy seds is to clip the blue end of the distribution , because any object which displays , say , @xmath43 will be corrected back to @xmath44 ( or whatever the most extreme @xmath7 contained in the galaxy sed library happens to be ) .",
    "the result is a red bias in the average @xmath1 .",
    "thus , as explicitly demonstrated by rogers et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the most robust way to determine an unbiased value of @xmath1 is via a pure power - law fit to the appropriate photometry .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is not to revisit these bias issues but , rather , to use the new , deep , multi - band near - infrared photometry provided by the udf12 wfc3/ir imaging campaign to avoid them , and deliver the first straightforward , unbiased measurement of @xmath1 for faint galaxies at @xmath3 ( comparable to , but somewhat fainter than the luminosity regime where @xmath45 was originally claimed by bouwens et al .",
    "the udf12 campaign was , in part , designed with this goal in mind .",
    "first , the increase in depth and the addition of an extra passband @xmath6 allows significantly more accurate measurements of uv slope down to @xmath46 .",
    "second , the introduction of the deep @xmath6 imaging allows object selection to be based primarily on a band which has minimal influence on derived uv slope ( whether derived by @xmath47 colour , or by power - law fitting through @xmath22 , @xmath6 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "a second aim of this paper is then to exploit both the new udf12 photometry , and the new @xmath4 and @xmath5 galaxies uncovered by mclure et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and schenker et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in our udf12 programme ( ellis et al .",
    "2013 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2013 ) , to present the first meaningful measurements of @xmath1 at @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "inevitably these first results on @xmath7 at even higher redshift apply to somewhat brighter absolute magnitudes ( @xmath9 ) than the faintest bin explored at @xmath3 , but nevertheless it is of interest to explore the behaviour of @xmath7 back to within @xmath48gyr of the big bang .",
    "measurements of @xmath7 at even earlier epochs will not be possible until the launch of the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( jwst ) and the advent of ground - based extremely large telescopes ( elts ) .",
    "finally , a third aim of this paper is to attempt to move beyond the determination of @xmath1 at @xmath3 , and explore whether the improved accuracy of individual measurements of @xmath7 afforded by the udf12 data provide any evidence for a significant intrinsic scatter in @xmath7 at @xmath3 .",
    "the impact of udf12 on the evidence for a colour - magnitude relation , and its potential evolution over a broader redshift range @xmath32 to @xmath3 will be considered in a separate paper ( rogers et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly summarize the new udf12+udf09 dataset , and the way in which our new high - redshift galaxy samples spanning the redshift range @xmath49 have been selected .",
    "then , in section 3 we present straightforward ( but now essentially unbiased ) ` traditional ' colour measurements of @xmath7 at @xmath3 ( to aid comparison with previous studies ) and also for the first time at @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in section 4",
    "we then present our ` best ' measurements of @xmath7 based on the multi - band power - law fitting as developed and advocated in rogers et al .",
    "here we also draw on the results of our simulations to demonstrate the absence of any substantial bias in our measurements , and to correct for any minor residual effects .",
    "we consider the astrophysical implications of our results in section 5 , including a comparison with the predictions of the latest hydrodynamical models of galaxy evolution . finally our conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system ( oke 1974 ) and any cosmological calculations assume @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "new hudf galaxy samples were selected from the final udf12+udf09 dataset as follows .",
    "first , sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) was used to select any source which yielded a @xmath53-@xmath20 detection in any one of the final single - band wfc3/ir @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath6 or @xmath23 images , or in any contiguous stacked combination of them ( i.e. @xmath21+@xmath22 , @xmath22+@xmath6 , @xmath6+@xmath23 , @xmath21+@xmath22+@xmath6 , @xmath22+@xmath6+@xmath23 , @xmath21+@xmath22+@xmath6+@xmath23 ) . the catalogues from these ten alternative detection runs were next merged to form a parent sample which was then culled by rejecting any source which showed a @xmath54-@xmath20 detection in any of the three shortest - wavelength ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) deep hst acs optical images of the hudf .",
    "this process means that the resulting galaxy sample should remain complete beyond @xmath58 ( although it will also yield some galaxies in the redshift range @xmath59 ; see mclure et al .",
    "2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "multi - band aperture photometry was then performed at the position of each object ( as determined from the detection image which yielded the highest signal : noise ratio detection ) , using ` matched ' circular apertures designed to contain 70% of the flux density from a point source .",
    "the appropriate aperture diameters as used are 0.5arcsec at @xmath23 , 0.47arcsec at @xmath6 , 0.44arcsec at @xmath22 , 0.40arcsec at @xmath21 , and 0.3arcsec for the acs @xmath60 photometry .",
    "the wfc3/ir and @xmath60 photometry was then all aperture - corrected to 82% of total to correctly match the photometric limits achieved for point sources in the bluer acs bands within a 0.3-arcsec diameter aperture .",
    "in addition , _ spitzer _ irac photometry at 3.6 and 4.5@xmath61 m was included for each source .",
    "this was based on a new deconfusion analysis of the deepest available irac hudf imaging ( labb et al .",
    "2012 ) using the method described by mclure et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and the final udf12 @xmath23 image as the best available template for the galaxies to be fitted to the sky as seen in the highly - confused irac imaging . in practice , for all but a few sources , this yielded formal non - detections .",
    "photometric redshifts ( with associated probability distributions ) were then derived on the basis of this 10-band photometry , using the method described in mclure et al .",
    "specifically , a wide range of galaxy seds from the bc03 models were utilised , limited only by insisting that galaxy ages were younger than the age of the universe at each redshift ) and dust extinction was allowed to float as high as @xmath62 .",
    "all flux - density measurements were utilised in this model fitting , even in bands where sources were undetected ( including negative flux - density where measured , thus ensuring a consistent derivation of @xmath63 ) .    on the basis of the sed fitting ,",
    "the sample was further refined by retaining only those sources which displayed a statistically - acceptable solution at @xmath64 ( i.e. redshift solutions with a formally acceptable value of @xmath63 , in practice @xmath65 ) . at this stage",
    "all remaining candidates were visually inspected , and rejected from the catalogue if they lay too near the perimeter of the imaging , or too close to bright sources for reliable photometry ( a cull that is reflected in the effective survey areas utilised by mclure et al .",
    "2013 in the luminosity function analysis presented therein ) .",
    "a final visual check was also performed to remove any object which yielded a significant detection in a smoothed , stacked @xmath55+@xmath56+@xmath57 pseudo broad - band optical acs image ( in order to further minimize the number of low - redshift galaxy contaminants ) .    finally , as in dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , all of the acs+wfc3/ir+irac sed fits were inspected , and the sources classified as robust or unclear depending on whether the secondary , low - redshift solution could be excluded at @xmath662-@xmath20 significance , as judged by @xmath67 between the secondary and primary redshift solution .",
    "the final result of this process is a sample of 146 sources , of which 97 are labelled as robust and 49 are unclear .",
    "absolute rest - frame uv magnitudes at @xmath68(@xmath69 ) have been calculated for all objects by integrating the spectral energy distribution of the best - fitting evolutionary synthesis model through a synthetic ` narrow - band ' filter of rest - frame width 100(see mclure et al .",
    "2011 ) .      for the specific purpose of the uv continuum slope analysis presented in this paper , the sample",
    "was then split into three redshift bins , yielding 116 galaxies at @xmath3 ( @xmath71 ) , 24 galaxies at @xmath4 ( @xmath72 ) and 6 galaxies at @xmath5 ( @xmath73 ) . finally , to minimize any bias in @xmath7 introduced at the galaxy - selection stage , we decided to limit the final galaxy catalogues at @xmath3 and @xmath4 to those objects which yielded a @xmath665-@xmath20 detection in the @xmath6 band alone ( i.e. @xmath74 in the 0.47-arcsec diameter aperture ) .",
    "this reduced the number of galaxies in each sub - sample to 45 at @xmath3 and 12 at @xmath4 , but still allows us to probe galaxy luminosities down to @xmath75 at @xmath3 .",
    "this also means that we are here exploiting the extra depth of the additional udf12 @xmath21 and @xmath23 imaging primarily for the determination of more accurate measurements of @xmath7 , rather than to push the detection threshold to the absolute limit .",
    "this somewhat conservative approach has the beneficial side - effect of reducing the fraction of unclear galaxies in the final sample to only @xmath76% , minimizing the need to consider the differences between analyses based on total or robust - only samples .",
    "all derived numbers , plots , and simulations presented hereafter assume the application of this @xmath6 threshold at @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , at @xmath5 , application of this threshold leaves only 2 objects , and so we do not apply it . in any case , as outlined in section 3.2 , by @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the bluest band involved in the @xmath7 estimation , and so its usefulness as an unbiased band for galaxy selection disappears . for this and other obvious reasons ,",
    "the results we present on @xmath1 at @xmath5 are treated separately , and should be regarded only as tentative / indicative ( as compared to the statistically - robust results we now provide at @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "the standard convention is to characterise the rest - frame uv continuum slope via a power - law index , @xmath7 , where @xmath77 . for objects at @xmath3 , the @xmath21-band photometry could , in principle , be contaminated by lyman-@xmath78 emission - line flux , and so it has been common practice to limit the measurement of @xmath7 at @xmath0 to an estimator based on @xmath47 colour ( e.g. bouwens et al . 2010b ; dunlop et al .",
    "2012 ) . now , with the addition of the new @xmath6 imaging from the udf12 campaign , a three - band ( @xmath22 , @xmath6 , @xmath23 ) power - law fit can be performed at @xmath3 . as quantified in rogers et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , a three - band power - law fit is in fact the optimal way to determine @xmath7 for galaxies in this redshift regime , and so we apply this method for the first time at these redshifts in section 4 . however , to facilitate comparison with previous work , and to see the direct impact of our deeper photometry and our @xmath6 galaxy selection on the results , we first perform the standard @xmath47 colour estimation of @xmath7 on our new udf12 @xmath6 filtered sample",
    ". moreover , at @xmath5 , only @xmath6 and @xmath23 are capable of sampling the continuum longward of @xmath79 , and so @xmath7 has to be based upon @xmath80 colour , rendering power - law fitting once again essentially redundant .",
    "the effective wavelengths of the filters of interest in this study are @xmath22:@xmath81=@xmath82 , @xmath6:@xmath81=@xmath83 , and @xmath23:@xmath81=@xmath84 .",
    "we note that these are the ` pivot ' wavelengths , incorporating not only the filter transmission profiles , but also the full throughput of wfc3/ir including detector sensitivity as a function of wavelength .",
    "there are of course a number of definitions of ` effective wavelength ' for broad - band filters , but the ` pivot ' wavelength is the appropriate one for the present study , and in any case agrees with the alternative ` mean ' ( source independent ) wavelength of the filter to within better than 1% ( see , for example , tokunaga & vacca 2005 ) .    adopting the above effective wavelengths , the appropriate equations for converting from near - infrared colour to @xmath7 are simply    @xmath85    for measurements at @xmath86 based on @xmath41 colour , and    @xmath87    for measurements at @xmath25 which have to be based purely on @xmath88 .    as already noted by dunlop et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , equation ( 1 ) differs very slightly from the relation adopted by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , which is @xmath89 ( presumably due to the adoption of slightly different effective wavelengths ) . however , the differences in derived values of @xmath7 are completely insignificant in the current context ( e.g. for @xmath90 , the bouwens et al .",
    "relation yields @xmath91 , while equation ( 1 ) yields @xmath92 ) .",
    "finally , we caution that equation ( 2 ) must be regarded with some scepticism .",
    "first , the relatively short wavelength - baseline provided by @xmath88 colour is reflected in the rather large coefficient by which colour ( and hence also uncertainties in colour ) must be multiplied to yield an estimate of @xmath7 .",
    "second , whereas @xmath22 and @xmath23 provide independent samples of a galaxy sed , the @xmath6 and @xmath23 bands overlap , and hence the resulting measurements are inevitably correlated to some extent . for both these reasons equation ( 1 ) should be utilised rather than equation ( 2 ) whenever possible .",
    "nevertheless , out of curiosity , in section 3.2 below we apply equation ( 2 ) to the 6 objects in the @xmath73 sample to obtain a first direct observational estimate of @xmath1 in this previously unexplored redshift regime .",

    "the scatter is very large , as expected given the photometric errors and the limitations of equation ( 2 ) already discussed above . nevertheless , since all of these objects have absolute uv magnitudes in the range @xmath107 we have proceeded to calculate the average @xmath1 for a single bin centred at @xmath9 .",
    "this is shown by the black point , which corresponds to @xmath108 ( where the error is the standard error in the mean ) .",

    "our simulations begin by defining a distribution of uv slopes . for the present study",
    "we adopt a delta function at @xmath111 as our reference model , but also consider ` top hat ' distributions of various widths , as discussed below in section 4.3 .",
    "next , we create an input catalogue of galaxies with @xmath7 values drawn from the defined distribution , redshifts in the range @xmath112 , and absolute magnitudes spanning @xmath113 ( with the relative number density of objects at different magnitudes governed by the latest @xmath114 luminosity function of mclure et al .",

    "3 we show the results of our power - law analysis for the galaxies at @xmath3 , split into the same three luminosity bins as in fig . 1 , and",
    "this time , for completeness , showing results for both the full ( upper row ) and robust - source only ( lower row ) samples .",
    "the grid of power - law models fitted to the wfc3/ir photometry extends over a deliberately very large range , @xmath118 , to ensure that the _ observed _ @xmath7 distribution is not artifically truncated .",
    "however , in practice ( primarily due to the @xmath6 significance cut ) the sample studied here has photometry of sufficient quality that no object yields a measured @xmath119 .",
    "the grey histograms in fig .",
    "3 show the distribution of the power - law derived @xmath7 values in each bin , and the small squares with error bars indicate the average @xmath1 values ( and associated standard errors ) .",
    "the results derived from the real data are compared here with the results from our reference simulation in which every fake galaxy is assigned @xmath105 before being inserted into the udf12 imaging ; the red histograms indicate the distribution of power - law @xmath7 values retrieved from the simulations , with the red points indicating the corresponding average and standard error in each luminosity bin .",
    "the red points thus offer a measure of the bias in our measurements of average @xmath120 which can be seen to be negligible for both the full and robust samples .",
    "as expected , it can be seen that confining the sample to robust sources results in the removal of a few of the redder galaxies in the faintest magnitude bin , but because the number of unclear sources is so small , the results are essentially unchanged ( especially when measured relative to simulation expectation , which also moves slightly blueward in the robust - source simulations ) .",
    "the final values given for the power - law determination of @xmath1 at @xmath3 in table 1 are taken from the full - sample analysis shown in the upper row of fig .",
    "3 , and are calculated relative to the simulated values ( to correct for any small residual bias ) . as long as the appropriate correction is applied ,",
    "the results are essentially identical if they are derived from the robust - source only analysis presented in the lower row . within the errors , all three luminosity bins at @xmath3",
    "are clearly consistent with @xmath105 , with a best - estimate of @xmath121 in the fainter two bins .",
    "reassuringly , the power - law estimates are fully consistent with the @xmath47 colour - based measurements presented in section 3 ( see table 1 for details and errors , and table a1 for individual object measurements ) .      in fig .",

    "the @xmath6 significance threshold leaves only two galaxies fainter than @xmath109 so , as in fig . 1",
    ", we limit our analysis to the two brighter bins .",
    "the samples are smaller , and so the corresponding random errors are larger , but again it can be seen that the values of @xmath120 derived from the data are consistent with @xmath105 in both luminosity bins , and the blue bias implied from the simulations is relatively modest ( although it is slightly larger if only robust objects are retained , as expected ) .    as at @xmath3 ,",
    "the final results for the power - law determination of @xmath1 at @xmath4 given in table 1 are derived from the full - sample analysis shown in the upper row of fig .",
    "4 , calculated relative to the simulated values . again , within the errors , both luminosity bins at @xmath4 are clearly consistent with @xmath105 , and the power - law estimates are fully consistent with the @xmath47 colour - based measurements presented in section 3 ( see table 1 , and table a1 for individual object measurements ) .",
    "our derived average values of @xmath1 reveal no evidence for a significant trend with redshift over the limited redshift range explored here , @xmath124 .",
    "however , it must be remembered that we are currently unable to explore the faintest absolute magnitude bin studied at @xmath3 at higher redshift .",
    "our results also do not yield any significant evidence for a relation between @xmath1 and @xmath93 at a given redshift , although again the available dynamic range is limited , and a full exploration of this issue is deferred to a future paper including results from brighter larger - area surveys .",
    "the one suggestive result that does merit additional scrutiny here is the apparent excess scatter seen in @xmath7 at the faintest absolute magnitudes probed at @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , in the lowest - luminosity bin plotted in fig .",
    "3 ( @xmath125 ) it appears that our simulation ( red line in the histogram ) does not replicate the observed scatter in @xmath7 ( grey region ) as successfully as at brighter magnitudes .",
    "it is of interest to attempt to quantify the statistical significance of this effect , as a growth in the intrinsic scatter in @xmath7 with decreasing luminosity might be expected if , for example , the faintest galaxy samples begin to include a significant number of very young , metal - poor objects .",
    "to do this we have expanded our simulations ( beyond a single value of @xmath105 ) to explore a variety of intrinsic @xmath7 distributions . in particular , we considered alternative top - hat distributions for the input values of @xmath7 in order to assess whether a wider intrinsic distribution can provide a significantly improved fit to the data in this faintest bin . to determine the statistical significance of our results , we used a k - s test , as illustrated in the comparison of the simulated and observed cumulative @xmath7 distributions presented in fig .",
    "5 . for clarity",
    "we restrict fig .",
    "5 to only 3 alternative input models , although for consistency we again show results for the full sample , and for robust sources only . from the k - s test significance values given in fig .",
    "5 it can be seen that the @xmath105 simulation in fact continues to provide a perfectly acceptable description of the data .",
    "unsurprisingly , a wider intrinsic distribution can provide an improved fit , although the highest significance values are achieved if this distribution remains centred on a value close to @xmath105 ( consistent with our results for @xmath1 ) .",
    "thus , while it is clear that we can not rule out the possibility that our galaxy sample contains some objects with uv slopes as blue as @xmath126 ( see table a1 ) , the current data certainly do not require any significant intrinsic scatter ( even in this well - populated luminosity bin ) .",
    "for now , therefore , reliable conclusions can only be drawn on the basis of population - averaged values , @xmath1 .",

    "( 2012 ) reported a measurement for @xmath127 at @xmath128 of @xmath129 , with the first error representing the random error , and the second the estimated systematic uncertainty ( albeit presumably , in practice , not symmetric ) .",

    "( 2010b ) measurement of @xmath130 in the same luminosity bin , with the change being due to the availability of the final udf09 dataset , improved assessment of bias , and ( possibly ) the removal of the @xmath22 flux - density threshold in the galaxy - selection process ( see rogers et al .",
    "2013 ) . clearly , however , the bouwens et al .",
    "( 2012 ) result still remains bluer than that reported here at comparable absolute magnitudes , albeit the two can be reconciled within the errors ( especially if the estimated systematic error is applied to the red , moving @xmath1 to @xmath131 ) .",

( 2012 ) results could easily still be biased blue in the faintest bin , as they did not have the advantage of the deeper photometry from udf12 exploited here , nor could the @xmath6 significance threshold be applied to assist in the selection of unbiased , secure sub - samples of galaxies .",
    "circumstantial evidence that the faintest measurement of @xmath1 of bouwens et al .",
    "( 2012 ) remains biased to the blue is offered by the fact that the @xmath1 value for their next brightest bin is much redder , at @xmath132 , in excellent agreement with our own results at comparable magnitudes .",
    "finkelstein et al . (",
    "2012 ) have also reported a move to redder values of @xmath1 for the faintest galaxies at @xmath3 as found in the final udf09 dataset compared to the original measurements made by finkelstein et al .",

    "2010 ) reported @xmath133 , while finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2012 ) reported a median value of @xmath134 which becomes @xmath135 after bias correction .",

    "we utilised only the first epoch of the udf09 dataset , and confined our attention to @xmath101-@xmath20 sources , and therefore did not report a robust result for absolute magnitudes as faint as @xmath136 at @xmath3 .",
    "we did , however , report @xmath137 at @xmath138 for @xmath3 galaxies ( in good agreement with the results from bouwens et al . and finkelstein et al .",
    "discussed above ) , and found @xmath139 at @xmath136 for @xmath140 .",
    "clearly these results are consistent with the values in the corresponding luminosity bins presented here at @xmath3 , confirming the apparent stability of @xmath1 for the uv - selected population in this high - redshift regime ( including the lack of any obvious redshift or luminosity dependence ) .",
    "finally , we note that finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2012 ) did attempt a measurement of @xmath1 at @xmath4 , and found @xmath141 , although this preliminary measurement was not deemed trustworthy enough for inclusion in the abstract ( in part because it was substantially redder than at @xmath3 ) .",
    "this result is in fact in very good agreement with the new , more robust determination at @xmath4 presented here , and indeed seems less surprising given our final results at @xmath3 .",
    "although we can not exclude some intrinsic scatter in @xmath7 , the analysis presented in section 4.4 shows that we have , as yet , no evidence for it .",
    "what is clear is that our derived values of average @xmath142 at @xmath3 clearly exclude the possibility that a _ large subset _ of galaxies in our sample have extreme values @xmath39 , as anticipated from very young , very low - metallicity , dust - free stellar populations .    to illustrate this , and further explore the consequences of our measurements for the inferred physical properties of the currently - detectable galaxies , we show in fig .",
    "6 how our results compare with the values expected from stellar populations of different metallicity , nebular emission ( related to ionizing escape fraction ) , dust reddening , and age ( up to the age of the universe at @xmath3 ) . in this figure",
    "our basic , most secure result at @xmath3 and @xmath9 ( which is also consistent with our results at @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) is indicated by the horizontal dotted line , while the @xmath143-@xmath20 uncertainty ( standard error ) is shown by the surrounding grey shaded band ( which acceptable models should therefore intercept at plausible ages ) .    the predictions of @xmath7 as a function of age shown in fig .",
    "6 have been produced using the bc03 evolutionary models .",
    "nebular continuum emission has been added to the stellar - population templates self - consistently , based on the flux of hydrogen - ionising photons predicted from each bc03 model ( using the code developed by robertson et al .",
    "the nebular continuum includes the emission of free - free and free - bound emission by h , neutral he and singly - ionised he , as well as the two - photon continuum of h ( see the prescription given in schaerer 2002 ) .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "6 we plot three alternative instantaneous starburst models , with metallicities equal to the solar value @xmath144 ( red ) , 0.2@xmath144 ( green ) , and 0.02@xmath144 ( blue ) . for each model",
    "we show the pure stellar prediction ( i.e. zero nebular emission @xmath31 an ionizing photon escape fraction of unity , @xmath145 ) as a solid line , and the extreme alternative of maximum nebular contribution ( @xmath31 zero ionizing photon escape fraction , @xmath146 ) by the dashed line of the same colour .",
    "not surprisingly for these burst models , the impact of the nebular continuum becomes negligible after @xmath76myr . during the time period when it is significant , its impact is more pronounced the lower the adopted metallicity ( see also figure 4 in bouwens et al .",
    "2010b ) .    from fig .",
    "6 we infer that our results are inconsistent with very young _ and _ very low metallicity models .",
    "moreover , while @xmath147 can be produced by essentially any metallicity at a carefully - selected age , the speed with which the uv continuum reddens with age , coupled with the homogeneity of our results , argues strongly that the burst models illustrated in the upper panel ( and in bouwens et al .",
    "2010b ) are inappropriate , and in any case physically unrealistic .",
    "a more natural assumption is that the galaxies selected by our rest - frame uv - selection technique are forming stars quasi - continuously ( at least on average , especially at these early times ) .",
    "therefore , in the lower panel of fig .",
    "6 we show predictions for constant star - formation models . again",
    "we show the @xmath144 ( red ) and 0.2@xmath144 ( green ) models , but this time ( for clarity ) omit the 0.02@xmath144 model because , without dust - reddening , the 0.2@xmath144 model is already too blue until an age of @xmath148gyr ( and the inferred trend with further reduction in metallicity is clear ) .",
    "instead , we add a second version of the 0.2@xmath144 model with modest dust obscuration / reddening ( @xmath149 for dust produced by type - ii supernovae ( snii ) , or @xmath150 for the extinction law of calzetti et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this last curve ( in dark green ) illustrates the degeneracy between dust extinction and the assumed metallicity of the stellar population .",
    "clearly , these continuously star - forming models provide a much more plausible explanation of our results , and are capable of delivering the observed homogeneous value of @xmath7 without any requirement for fine tuning in age ( i.e. @xmath7 is little changed over the relevant timescale , @xmath76myr to @xmath151myr ) .",
    "one is then left to choose between solar metallicity with very little room for any additional dust reddening , or moderately sub - solar metallicity stellar populations coupled with modest dust reddening .",
    "the degeneracies are clear , but the latter scenario is arguably more plausible , and in fact happens to correspond well with the physical properties predicted for the currently observable galaxies ( i.e. @xmath152 ) from the cosmological galaxy - formation simulation discussed below .",
    "finally , we note that while , as expected , the contribution from nebular emission persists to much longer times in these continually star - forming models , even the extremes adopted here of @xmath145 and @xmath146 yield unobservably small differences in observed @xmath7 .",
    "thus , if quasi - continous star - forming galaxies of modestly sub - solar metallicity are the correct interpretation of our results , there is currently no realistic prospect of estimating @xmath38 from measurements of the uv continuum slope at @xmath3 .",
    "it is instructive to compare our findings with the predictions of a state - of - the - art cosmological galaxy - formation simulation .",

    "as discussed in section 1 , the ability of a given galaxy to contribute to the ionization of the surrounding inter - galactic medium depends on its luminosity , the age and metallicity of its stellar population , and the escape fraction of ionizing photons    unfortunately , the relatively modest values of @xmath1 found in the present study do not easily lend themselves to straightforward interpretation .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "6 suggests that there is little prospect of using our new measurements of @xmath1 to set new constraints on the ionizing - photon escape fraction , @xmath38 , without significant additional information ( e.g. a meaningful estimate of the contribution of nebular emission lines to the rest - frame optical colours , as measured by _ spitzer _",

    "2013 ; labb et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the degeneracy between metallicity and dust obscuration is somewhat less of an issue for reionization calculations than for calculations of cosmic star - formation rate density , as the former concerned only with the uv photons which survive to exit a galaxy and potentially contribute to cosmic reionization .",
    "moreover , our finding that @xmath1 remains close to @xmath105 at @xmath28 and even @xmath5 suggests that the galaxies detected to date already contain relatively mature , metal - enriched stellar populations , lending support to a picture in which star - formation ( and hence cosmic reionization ) commenced at significantly higher redshifts .",
    "we have used the new ultra - deep , near - infrared imaging of the hudf provided by our udf12 hst wfc3/ir imaging campaign to explore the rest - frame uv properties of galaxies at redshifts @xmath0 . in this study",
    "we have exploited the final multi - band wfc3/ir imaging ( udf12+udf09 ) to select deeper and more reliable galaxy samples at @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , and to provide improved photometric redshifts .",
    "most importantly , we have used the enhanced dataset to provide more accurate photometry , and to base galaxy selection primarily on the new @xmath6 imaging , which exerts minimal influence on the derivation of the uv spectral index @xmath7 ( @xmath2 ) from either @xmath41 colour ( e.g. bouwens et al . 2010b ; dunlop et al .",
    "2012 ) , or @xmath189 power - law fitting ( as advocated by rogers et al .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "* i ) * we have produced the first robust and unbiased measurement of the average uv power - law index , @xmath1 , ( @xmath2 ) for faint galaxies at @xmath3 , finding @xmath8 at @xmath3 for galaxies with @xmath9 .",
    "this result means that the faintest galaxies uncovered to date at this epoch have , _ on average _ , uv colours no more extreme than those displayed by the bluest star - forming galaxies found in the low - redshift universe .",
    "* ii ) * we have made the first meaningful measurements of @xmath1 at @xmath190 , finding a similar value , @xmath10 .",
    "* iii ) * we have offered a tentative first estimate of @xmath1 at @xmath5 ( based on the @xmath88 colours of the six galaxies in the redshift range @xmath73 reported in ellis et al .",
    "2013 ) , and find @xmath11 , essentially unchanged from @xmath12 ( albeit highly uncertain ) .    *",
    "iv ) * finally , we have used careful end - to - end source injection+retrieval+analysis simulations to quantify any small residual biases in our measurements , and to test for any evidence for significant intrinsic scatter in the @xmath7 values displayed by the galaxies in the faintest luminosity bin which we can study at @xmath3 . while models including a range of @xmath7 values provide a modestly - improved description of the data , we find that there is , as yet , no evidence for a significant _ intrinsic _ scatter in @xmath7 within our new @xmath3 galaxy sample .",
    "our results exclude the possibility that even our faintest galaxy samples contain a substantial population of very low - metallicity , dust - free objects with @xmath39 .",
    "rather , our findings are most easily explained by a population of steadily star - forming galaxies with either @xmath13 solar metallicity and zero dust , or moderately sub - solar ( @xmath14% ) metallicity with modest dust obscuration ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this latter interpretation is consistent with the predictions of a state - of - the - art galaxy - formation simulation , which also suggests that a significant population of very - low metallicity , dust - free galaxies with @xmath16 may not emerge until @xmath17 , a regime likely to remain inaccessible until the jwst .",
