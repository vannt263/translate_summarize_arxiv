    "there are many examples in physics , chemistry and biology , where non - equilibrium processes at the surface of a particle drive exterior fluid flow and lead , possibly , to motion of the particle . such non - equilibrium processes are frequently confined to a thin region surrounding the particle , as for example in phoretic phenomena @xcite , motion in chemically reacting flows @xcite , and in ciliary propulsion @xcite . following the pioneering efforts of helmholtz @xcite , smoluchowski @xcite and derjaguin @xcite ,",
    "methods have been developed , to relate the rigid body motion of a particle to the structure of the active boundary layer that surrounds it @xcite .",
    "the corresponding many - body problem , of determining the collective motion and exterior flow of @xmath0 particles with active boundary layers , has received much less attention @xcite .    in this paper , we present a systematic method of computing many - body hydrodynamic interactions between colloidal particles due to the exterior microhydrodynamic flow produced by active boundary layers at their surfaces .",
    "the hydrodynamic interaction between particles is mediated by the ambient fluid which , in the microhydrodynamic limit , obeys stokes equation .",
    "the boundary conditions are determined by the flow in the active boundary layer .",
    "depending on the structure of the boundary layer , these may be dirichlet conditions specifying the active surface velocity , or , neumann conditions specifying the surface traction . in either case , the fluid flow in the bulk admits an integral representation in terms of the velocities and tractions on the particle boundaries .",
    "we use the integral representation to derive the rigid body motion of the particles , in terms of the boundary conditions and any external forces and torques that may be applied to the particles .    in section [ section : boundary - integral ]",
    "we present the galerkin method of solving the boundary integral equation . in this method ,",
    "the boundary tractions and velocities are expanded in an infinite - dimensional basis of complete , orthogonal functions defined on the particle boundaries .",
    "on enforcing the boundary condition to this bulk fluid velocity , an integral equation is obtained for the unknown boundary traction ( when dirichlet conditions are specified ) or the unknown boundary velocities ( when neumann conditions are specified ) .",
    "the solution of this boundary integral equation provides both the particle velocities and angular velocities and the bulk fluid flow . on enforcing the boundary conditions in a weighted residual sense , with weighting functions that are identical to the expansion functions ,",
    "a system of linear equations is obtained for the unknown expansion coefficients .",
    "the solution of the linear system determines the expansion coefficients of the unknown boundary traction ( when dirichlet conditions are specified ) or that of the unknown boundary velocities ( when neumann conditions are specified ) .",
    "we focus attention on the former situation , where the velocity profile in the boundary layer is provided .",
    "the velocity seen by the exterior fluid is the sum of the rigid body motion of the particle and the velocity at the outer edge of the boundary layer . when the boundary layer is thin compared to the size of the particle , the boundary condition can be applied directly on the surface of the particle as the sum of a rigid body motion and an active slip .",
    "the problem is solved when the rigid body motion and the exterior fluid flow are determined completely in terms of the slip velocities specified on each particle surface . as the stokes equations are linear , the rigid body motion must be a linear functional of the active slip .",
    "we show how this linear functional relationship is expressed through propulsion matrices , which appear naturally in the solution of linear system of equations .",
    "the propulsion matrices relate the vector of rigid body motions of the particle to the vector of expansion coefficients of the active slip .",
    "the problem of computing hydrodynamic interactions between active colloidal particles is , thereby , reduced to that of computing the propulsion matrices .",
    "the analysis also reveals that the propulsion matrices are a sum of two parts : one is the contribution from the superposition of flows due to each particle and the other is a correction required to satisfy the boundary conditions .",
    "the first is the two - body contribution to hydrodynamic interactions while the second contains the genuine many - body contribution .    in section [ section : microhydrodynamics - active - spheres ] , which contains the central results of this paper , we focus on spherical colloidal particles with active slip .",
    "we chose tensorial spherical harmonics as the galerkin expansion basis , which are complete and orthogonal on the surface of the sphere .",
    "the simplicity of the spherical shape allows us to calculate all boundary integrals and matrix elements analytically , in terms of derivatives of the green s function of stokes flow .",
    "the structure of the flow has a pleasing simplicity , as shown in table [ table : irred_fluid_flow ] . at any order ,",
    "there are at most three kinds of derivatives , which are the irreducible gradient of the green s function , its curl and its laplacian .",
    "this leads to a simple classification of the flow in terms of irreducible tensors of increasing rank . as numerical quadrature",
    "is no longer necessary to evaluate the matrix elements , the linear system can be solved both efficiently and accurately .",
    "this linear solution yields the mobility and propulsion matrices which completely describe the many - body hydrodynamic interactions in active suspensions .    in section [ section : minimal - active - spheres ]",
    "we truncate the infinite series expansion of the boundary fields to the minimal number of terms required to produce active translations and rotations . at this order of truncation",
    ", all long - ranged hydrodynamic interactions are also automatically included .",
    "we show that there are exactly two coefficients in the expansion of the active slip that produce translation and rotation .",
    "the translational coefficient produces a flow that decays inverse cubically with distance while the rotational coefficient produces a flow that decays inverse quartically with distance .",
    "we plot the flows generated by all terms in the truncated expansion in figure [ fig : single - particle - flows ] .",
    "in section [ section : squirmers_trap ] we illustrate our general formalism with a detailed study of the dynamics of active colloidal particles in a harmonic trap . for the squirming motion of a sphere",
    ", we recast the leading terms of lighthill @xcite and blake s @xcite solution in our formalism .",
    "the problem of squirmers in a harmonic potential has been studied earlier by nash et al .",
    "@xcite , and more recently , by hennes , wolff and stark @xcite . in our study",
    ", we attempt to find out the necessary and sufficient ingredients to obtain steady - state convective currents , the so - called `` self - assembled pump '' .",
    "we find that the key ingredients necessary for the pumping state are ( a ) one - body self - propulsion and ( b ) two - body rotation from the vorticity of the stokeslet induced in the trap .",
    "thus , neither tumbling ( as included in nash et al . ) nor stresslet flows ( as included in hennes et al . ) are necessary .",
    "our simulation of @xmath1 squirmers , the largest such simulation till date , displays the formation of the self - assembled pump with greater clarity than previous studies .",
    "we conclude with a comparison of our approach with existing theories of collective hydrodynamics of active particles and with a discussion of applications of the integral equation technique to rheology in active colloidal suspensions .",
    "we consider @xmath0 active particles , of arbitrary shape , in an incompressible fluid of viscosity @xmath2 .",

    "points on the particle boundary @xmath6 are labelled , in the frame attached to the center of the mass , by @xmath7 , or equivalently , in the laboratory frame by @xmath8 .",
    "particle trajectories are obtained from newton s equations , where the right hand sides include both contact and body contributions , @xmath9 the stress @xmath10 of the ambient fluid provides the surface traction @xmath11 on each particle , from which the net contact force @xmath12 and the net contact torque @xmath13 can be computed . here",
    "@xmath14 is the unit normal pointing away from the particle into the fluid , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mass and the moment of inertia of the particle respectively , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are external body forces and torques . in the absence of inertia , as appropriate to the microhydrodynamic regime , newton s equations reduce to a pair of constraints , @xmath19 there is an instantaneous balance between contact and body forces at all times , which precludes any acceleration of the particles . in the absence of external forces ,",
    "newton s equations reduce further to @xmath20 the trivial solution to this is @xmath21 , that is , there is no motion in the absence of external forces and torques .",
    "the non - trivial solutions describe active motion , in which translation and rotation are possible in the absence of external forces and torques .",
    "it is these non - trivial solutions that we seek here .",
    "the velocity and angular velocity , having being determined from non - trivial solutions of the stress , determine the evolution of the positions and orientations through the kinematical equations , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a fixed axis passing through the center of mass of the body . if the shape is not a figure of revolution about this axis , two additional evolution equations , which together describe the motion of the orthogonal triad attached to the center of mass , are necessary .",
    "the contact forces on the particles are determined from the state of flow in the ambient fluid . in the region bounded by the particles",
    ", the fluid satisfies stokes equation @xcite ,    [ eq : stokes_equation ] @xmath24    where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath10 are the fluid velocity , pressure and stress respectively .",
    "the solution of this equation , with the appropriate boundary conditions , provides the surface traction and hence the contact forces and torques that determine the rigid body motion .    as discussed in the introduction , a generic consequence of activity on the surface of rigid bodies",
    "is the appearance of a boundary layer .",
    "when the boundary layer is thin compared to the particle size , its effect appears as a boundary condition , on either the velocity or the traction , at the particle surface .",
    "a detailed discussion of both forms of boundary conditions and their applicability to different boundary layer problems is available in @xcite .    the problem of determining the surface traction is substantially simplified by recognising that the solution of the three - dimensional partial differential equation in ( [ eq : stokes_equation ] ) can be expressed as an integral of the velocity and traction fields over the boundaries of the particles @xcite @xmath27 \\ , { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d } } } s_m ,    \\quad     \\substack {    \\displaystyle { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r } } } \\in v     \\\\ \\\\",

    "the contribution from the boundary which encloses both the fluid and the particles is not included here , since it is assumed that both the green s function and the flow vanish on this boundary . equating the expression for the bulk fluid velocity to the boundary condition and evaluating the second integral as a principal value leads to an integral equation on the particle boundaries @xcite , @xmath38 \\ , { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d } } } s_m ,    \\quad    \\substack{\\displaystyle { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{r}}}_n \\in s_n \\\\ \\\\ \\displaystyle",

    "the solution linearly relates the surface traction to the surface velocity and the balance of contact and body forces then determines the rigid body motion .",
    "the problem of determining the traction is thus reduced to solving a two - dimensional integral equation on the boundaries of the domain instead of a three - dimensional partial differential equation in the bulk .",

    "the only constraint we place on the active velocity is that it conserves mass , as reflected in the integral condition of ( [ eq : no_flux ] ) .",
    "this makes our theory completely general . in specific cases ,",
    "the active velocity may be determined by other local fields like the temperature ( in thermophoresis ) , ionic species ( in electrophoresis ) and chemical species ( in diffusiophoresis ) .",
    "here we assume that any non - fluid degree of freedom necessary to specify the active velocity has already been determined , and thus , our work treats the purely hydrodynamic aspect of the problem .",

    "the contact force and contact torque are determined from newton s equations and are , therefore , known quantities , while all remaining coefficients are unknowns .",
    "therefore , we seek to obtain the unknown velocity and angular velocity in terms of the active velocity , constrained by the balance of contact and external forces as required by newton s equation .    to the above end , we group the expansion coefficients for all particles into vectors and",
