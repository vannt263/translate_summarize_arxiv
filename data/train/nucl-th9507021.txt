    "the nonrelativistic wave functions in this scheme are solutions of the schrdinger - like wave equation ( [ 1.12 ] ) .",
    "detailed comparisons between the relativistic and first - order nonrelativistic predictions for the differential cross sections and photon asymmetries show large differences between the two types of calculations .",
    "the inclusion of terms to second order in @xmath112 in the interaction hamiltonian , where medium corrections effected by the nuclear potentials are left out , does not lead to any substantial improvement in the agreement between the relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations . on the other hand",
    "the expansion scheme shows explicit dependence in the second order terms on the nuclear potentials .",
    "when these medium corrections are taken into account the nonrelativistic calculations converge close to the relativistic results .",
    "this indicates that the essential difference between the relativistic and traditional nonrelativistic amplitudes , is the absence in the latter of the medium modification of the interaction hamiltonian as a consequence of the presence of the strong vector and scalar potentials .",
    "these conclusions are further supported through an analysis based on the foldy - wouthuysen transformation of the relativistic hamiltonian describing a photon interacting with a nucleon embedded in the nuclear medium .",
    "the nonrelativistic wave functions for the bound and continuum nucleons are solutions of the wave equation obtained as a result of the transformation .",
    "the scheme leads to a nonrelativistic amplitude calculated to the desired order in @xmath112 .",
    "we use these amplitudes to carry out comparisons between relativistic and nonrelativistic calculations in the manner described above for the pauli scheme .",
    "we find that the medium modifications in the second order calculations are important and their inclusion leads in general to better agreement with the relativistic calculations .",
    "however the convergence is not as efficient at this order as in the pauli case .",
    "the reasons for this can be understood in terms of the formal differences between the structure of the nonrelativistic amplitude obtained using this transformation as compared to the pauli reduction case .",
    "the wave functions obtained through the fw reduction are different at each order in @xmath112 , in contrast to the pauli wave functions which are unchanged for all orders ( recall that in the pauli reduction only the interaction hamiltonian is expanded ) .",
    "the basic result of the present work is that standard nonrelativistic calculations of the knock - out amplitude do not properly take into account the strong medium modifications of the interaction hamiltonian .",
