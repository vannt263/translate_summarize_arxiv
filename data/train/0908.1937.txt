    "<S> we have investigated a phase transition of a long - range rkky ising spin glass dy@xmath0y@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2  by means of the dc and the ac magnetization measurements . the static nonlinear susceptibility </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 exhibits a divergent behavior toward @xmath4 @xmath5 1.925 k with the exponent of @xmath6 @xmath5 1.08 . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic relaxation time @xmath7 obtained from the ac magnetization measurements also diverges to the same @xmath4 with the exponent of @xmath8 @xmath5 1.9 in zero static field . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate the spin glass phase transition belonging to the mean - field universality class , in which the exponents of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are 1 and 2 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we observed the divergence of @xmath7 in a finite field of 500 oe toward @xmath4 @xmath5 1.412 k with the exponent of @xmath8 @xmath5 2.1 , being quite similar to that in zero field . </S>",
    "<S> it strongly suggests an existence of the spin glass phase transition in a finite field and the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) in the long - range ising spin glass dy@xmath0y@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 .    in spite of the long - period investigation on the spin glass for more than 30 years </S>",
    "<S> , there are still several unsolved problems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is whether the replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) predicted by the mean - field theory of the spin glass @xcite occurs or not in real spin glass materials . in the mean field picture </S>",
    "<S> , the spin glass state has a complicated multi - valley structure of the free - energy and survives in a finite magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> alternative theory of the spin glass , so called the droplet theory based on the renormalization group arguments , predicts no rsb and that only two thermodynamic states related each other by a global spin flip exist in the spin glass state @xcite . in the droplet picture , no spin glass phase transition exists in the presence of a magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> many numerical studies have been employed extensively on a stability of the spin glass phase in the presence of magnetic field @xcite , however it is still controversial . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental study of the short - range ising spin glass fe@xmath0mn@xmath1tio@xmath11  gave an evidence against an equilibrium phase transition in a finite magnetic field and indicated that the droplet picture is appropriate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the magnetic torque measurements of several heisenberg spin glasses exhibit the existence of true phase transitions in fields @xcite .    in this article , we reported recent ac and dc magnetization measurements for the ising spin glass dy@xmath0y@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2  . </S>",
    "<S> dyru@xmath2si@xmath2  is a rare - earth intermetallic compound with the tetragonal thcr@xmath2si@xmath2-type crystal structure , exhibiting two successive antiferromagnetic transitions with @xmath12 @xmath5 29 k and @xmath13 @xmath5 3.5 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the compound has a strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy and recognized as an ising antiferromagnet . in the diluted system dy@xmath0y@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2 , where the magnetic dy@xmath14-ion is substituted by the non - magntic y@xmath14-ion , a spin glass transition is undergone with @xmath15 @xmath5 0.103 . in this compound , </S>",
    "<S> the ising dy@xmath14-moments interact via the long - range rkky interaction , and hence , its spin glass phase transition could belong to a different universality class from the short - range ising spin glass such as fe@xmath0mn@xmath1tio@xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> our analyses of the static and the dynamic critical phenomena present that dy@xmath0y@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2  exhibits the mean field type phase transition in zero and finite fields where the replica symmetry should be broken .    </S>",
    "<S> the single crystalline sample of dy@xmath0y@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2  with @xmath15 @xmath5 0.103 was grown by the czhochralski method with a tetra - arc furnace . </S>",
    "<S> the concentration of dy was determined by comparing the saturated magnetization of the diluted compound along the magnetic easy c - axis with that of the pure compund dyru@xmath2si@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the ac and the dc magnetizations were measured with use of a squid magnetometer mpms ( quantum design ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ac measurements were performed with an ac - field of 3 oe and frequency of 0.5 hz @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath16 1000 hz .     ( a ) temperature dependences of the dc magnetizations divided by the magnetic field @xmath18 at @xmath19 @xmath5 10 oe with the zfc and the fc conditions . </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) shows the temperature dependence of the dc magnetization divided by the magnetic field @xmath18 at @xmath19 @xmath5 10 oe . the dc magnetization was measured with the zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and the field - cooled ( fc ) conditions . </S>",
    "<S> a distinct deviation of the zfc and the fc magnetizations was found around 1.9 k , which is a characteristic of a spin glass phase transition . in fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) the temperature dependence of the negative nonlinear susceptibility @xmath20 is also shown , which is the order parameter susceptibility of the spin glass phase transition in zero field limit . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear susceptibility @xmath3 was obtained by fitting the magnetization divided by the magnetic field @xmath23 at each temperature as a function of @xmath24 in the form of , @xmath25 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( a ) , @xmath3 exhibits negative divergent behavior toward @xmath26 1.9 k. to examine the critical divergence of @xmath27 , a log - log plot of @xmath28 against the reduced temperature @xmath21 @xmath29 @xmath22 is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the best plot showing a linear relation between @xmath30 and @xmath31 is obtained with @xmath4 @xmath5 1.925 k and the critical exponent @xmath6 @xmath5 1.08 . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath6 is very close to @xmath9 @xmath5 1 predicted in the mean - field theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests that the spin glass phase transition in dy@xmath0y@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2  is the mean - field type .     </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the temperature dependences of the real part of the ac susceptibility @xmath35 with zero bias dc field and a finite field of 500 oe , respectively . in the figures , thermodynamic equilibrium susceptibilities @xmath34 at respective fields </S>",
    "<S> are also shown , which is determined as @xmath36 @xmath5 @xmath37 from the dc magnetization measurements . in both zero and finite fields , </S>",
    "<S> the ac susceptibilities deviate from the equilibrium ones in low temperature regions and show broad maximums . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature showing the maximum increases with increasing the frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of @xmath32 does not represent a thermal equilibrium phase transition but a spin freezing in a finite observation time ( @xmath5 @xmath38 ) . according to the dynamic scaling hypothesis @xcite , the characteristic relaxation time @xmath7 exhibits the critical divergence as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the dynamic and the correlation length critical exponents respectively . in this study </S>",
    "<S> , we identify @xmath42 ( @xmath5 @xmath38 ) in the criterion of @xmath43 @xmath5 @xmath44 . </S>",

( b ) log - log plots of the characteristic relaxation time @xmath7 vs. @xmath21 @xmath5 @xmath22 at @xmath19 @xmath5 0 and 500 oe . ]    we plot @xmath45 @xmath5 @xmath46 with @xmath47 @xmath5 @xmath38 , corresponding the dynamic spin correlation function , in zero field against time at several temperatures in fig . [ fig3 ] ( a ) . above criterion to identify @xmath7 , @xmath45 @xmath5 @xmath48 , </S>",
    "<S> is represented by the horizontal dashed line in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 at @xmath19 @xmath5 500 oe was also determined by using the same plot . because the frequency dependence of the ac susceptibility of dy@xmath0y@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2  is very strong , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , we can see the decay of the spin correlations over three decades in magnitude at 4 k in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ( a ) . as decreasing temperature , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics becomes slower , and @xmath45 does not reach 0.1 below 2 k , which is very close to @xmath4 @xmath5 1.925 k obtained from the static critical scaling analysis of the nonlinear susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> it is consistent with the general feature of @xmath7 , being infinite below @xmath4 , and hence , we concluded that our criterion to identify @xmath7 is appropriate for the present compound .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3 ] ( b ) shows log - log plots of @xmath42 vs. @xmath21 @xmath5 @xmath22 at @xmath19 @xmath5 0 and 500 oe , respectively . in zero field , we assigned @xmath4 @xmath5 1.925 k , being the same value obtained from the static critical scaling analysis of the nonlinear susceptibility , and obtained the dynamic critical exponent @xmath8 @xmath5 1.9 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the analysis of @xmath42 at @xmath19 @xmath5 500 oe gives a finite spin glass transition temperature @xmath49 @xmath5 1.412 k and quite similar critical exponent @xmath8 @xmath5 2.1 to that in zero field . </S>",

    "<S> the value of @xmath8 is much smaller than that in other spin glasses , for instance @xmath8 @xmath50 11 in fe@xmath0mn@xmath1tio@xmath11  @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> it is consistent with the prediction of the mean - field theory , where @xmath10 is 2 with @xmath51 @xmath5 4 and @xmath52 @xmath5 1/2 @xcite .    in conclusion , the static scaling analysis of the nonlinear susceptibility and the dynamic scaling analysis of the characteristic relaxation time reveal the presence of the mean - field type phase transition in the long - range rkky ising spin glass dy@xmath0y@xmath1ru@xmath2si@xmath2  in both zero and finite magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the mean - field picture indicates that the replica symmetry is broken in the spin glass state of the compound . </S>"
