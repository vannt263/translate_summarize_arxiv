    "colliding winds occur in various types of stellar binaries , including those with massive ob and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , lower mass eruptive symbiotic systems containing a white dwarf and red giant star which undergo a `` slow nova '' outburst , and binary systems which contain one or two pulsars blowing a pulsar wind(s ) .",
    "high - spatial - resolution observations are revealing many interesting features in such systems . in massive o+o and wr+o binaries ,",

    "the shape of these structures can be described by archimedean spirals which are believed to follow the wind - wind collision region in systems where the winds are of very unequal momentum .",
    "colliding winds also play a key role in eruptive symbiotic systems , where a hot , fast , diffuse wind from a white dwarf companion interacts with a slow massive wind from a mira type primary star .",
    "the class of eruptive symbiotics can be divided into two further subtypes : classical symbiotics , in which the bolometric luminosity remains constant and outbursts typically last about 100 days ( z  and is an example ) , and the more powerful eruptions known as symbiotic novae , where the bolometric luminosity increases by a factor of order 10 - 100 on a timescale of about a year , and the system stays in an active state for @xmath1yrs ( well - known examples are v1016  cyg , hm  sge , and ag  pegasi ) .",

    "relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite and sph @xcite models have been used to investigate the wind - wind collision in pulsar wind binary systems .",
    "although dramatic improvements in computational power and techniques in recent years have spurred the development of 3d models of colliding winds , such work remains computationally expensive , and it is still difficult to perform simulations of cwb s even on high performance parallel machines when the orbital eccentricity is high .",
    "we therefore present a new method which captures the flow dynamics while requiring less computational resources .    at its heart ,",
    "our approach adopts the equations for the ram pressure balance between the two winds as detailed by @xcite . in this work",
    "it is assumed that both winds are highly radiative , rapidly cool , and fully mix . while these assumptions are only relevant in close binaries , it provides a convenient starting point and",
    "the position of the contact discontinuity is unlikely to drastically change even if the wind - wind collision is essentially adiabatic .",
    "then , at some distance downstream of the apex of the wind - wind collision region ( wcr ) the flow is assumed to reach a terminal speed and to thereafter flow ballistically ( i.e. no net force acting upon it ) .",

    "this paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : shkconemodel ] we explain the steps necessary to construct our dynamical model of the wind - wind collision .",
    "  [ subsec : emission ] shows how it can be used to simulate the x - ray emission and circumstellar absorption arising from the wcr in early - type binary systems , though this is but one example of the potential use of such a model . in   [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize and conclude our findings , and outline possible future directions .",
    "in the model the orbit is calculated in the frame of one of the stars ( herafter referred to as the primary star ) .",
    "the winds are assumed to reach their terminal speeds before they collide .",
    "the contact discontinuity ( cd ) is split into two sections , to account for the effect of orbital motion :    \\i ) a region close to the apex of the wcr where the flow from the stagnation point is accelerating along the cd ( hereafter called the `` shock cap '' ) .",
    "the shock cap is terminated where the flow is assumed to become ballistic ( the `` ballistic point '' ) , the exact point being calibrated against hydrodynamical models ( see   [ subsec : bcd ] ) . while the properties of the shock cap are assumed to be axisymmetric , orbital motion introduces an aberration angle which means that the symmetry axis and the line of centres of the stars are not colinear ( see   [ subsec : shockcap ] ) .",
    "\\ii ) a region beyond the ballistic point where the flow along the contact discontinuity is unaffected by the primary and secondary stars gravity , ram pressure from the winds , or thermal pressure in the wcr .",
    "if the stellar winds have differing speeds , the flow in this region is assumed to move with the speed of the slower wind , since this is the wind which responds least to the orbital motion of the stars , and dominates the absorption in the system ( in the models presented in this paper , both winds have the same speed of @xmath3 - see table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "this region is termed the `` ballistic cd '' .    by separating the cd into these two sections",
    "we can model the effect of the winding of the cd around the stars and the subsequent absorption by the un - shocked winds .",
    "we do not attempt to model the shocks which bound either side of the cd in this work , as in many circumstances the shocked gas efficiently cools and is compressed by the ram pressure of the pre - shock wind into a thin dense sheet coincident with the cd .",
    "for instance , in symbiotic novae , the hot wind is likely to be strongly radiative ( see fig .  4 in * ? ? ? * ) , as of course is the cool wind , and our model therefore gives the position of the shocked gas and the dense spiral shells which subsequently form .",
    "strong radiative cooling is also a feature of the wcr in many massive binaries . in , for example , the primary lbv wind is so dense ( and slow ) that it is strongly radiative around the entire orbit @xcite .",
    "the importance of cooling in the wcr can be quantified using the cooling parameter @xcite ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the wind velocity in units of @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the separation of the stars in units of @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the mass - loss rate of the star in units of @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the cooling time , and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the postshock sound speed ) is the characteristic time for hot gas near the apex of the wcr to flow downstream . in practice ,",
    "hydrodynamical simulations show that the wind collision region ( wcr ) is adiabatic for @xmath14 , whereas for @xmath15 it cools rapidly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wcr ] ) .    fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] shows the value of @xmath16 as a function of orbital period for each shocked wind in a hypothetical o+o star binary with a circular orbit , wind speeds of @xmath17 , and mass - loss rates of @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the primary and secondary star of masses 50 and 30 respectively .",
    "clearly both of the shocked winds are largely adiabatic , even down to an orbital period of @xmath20days ( in shorter period systems the stars are close enough together that acceleration / deceleration of the winds needs to be considered ) .",
    "however , in a hypothetical wr+o system where the mass - loss rates of the primary and secondary stars are now @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and both stars have masses of @xmath23 and wind speeds of @xmath24 , cooling is important for orbital periods @xmath25yr .",
    "if the wr star is a wc subtype , cooling is important for periods up to several years , since cooling is more efficient with such abundances ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] shows that the denser winds from wr stars are likely to produce radiative shocks in many instances , though the o+o systems will usually be adiabatic unless the orbital period , @xmath26d , or the winds are slower and/or denser than assumed above .",
    "the postshock winds of both the primary and secondary stars in the simulations discussed in   [ subsec : emission ] are largely adiabatic . in such cases ,",
    "the temperature of the hot gas in the wcr as a function of distance downstream from the stagnation point at the apex of the wcr has been determined by @xcite . with this information it is possible to derive the width of the post - shock layer , and hence the position of the shocks , as a function of downstream distance . however",
    ", this is beyond the scope of the present work .    in the following sections we detail the modelling of the shock cap and ballistic cd .",
    "the shape of the shock cap is determined from momentum balance requirements .",
    "the surface density and velocity of the flow along the shock cap are obtained from eqs .",
    "29 and 30 of @xcite ( the latter scaled to the speed of the slower wind ) . assuming the winds are already at their terminal velocity when they reach the shocks , the locus of the cd is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the distance from the centre of the primary star and @xmath29 is the angle between the vector to the primary star and the line - of - centres ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cantofig1 ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the wind momenta is given by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the mass - loss rates and terminal velocities of the primary and secondary stars respectively .",
    "the shock cap is symmetrical about the line of centres before the effects of orbital motion are introduced .",
    "the 2d ( @xmath35 ) coordinates of points on the shock cap in units of the stellar separation , @xmath36 , are    @xmath37    @xmath38    to determine the coordinates in 3d , the 2d arms of the wcr can be rotated azimuthally .",
    "the @xmath39 , and @xmath40 vectors ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 respectively ) from the center of the primary star to coordinates on the shock cap are then    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the true anomaly of the orbit and @xmath46 is the azimuthal angle subtended between a coordinate on the surface of the shock cap , the line of centres , and the @xmath47 ( orbital ) plane .",
    "the number of coordinate points on the shock cap is determined by the values of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . with @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( i.e. 20 azimuthal points per 2d @xmath53 value ) , the shock cap consists of @xmath54 separate coordinate points .",
    ".  29 of @xcite is used to determine the tangential velocity along the cd , and thus the position of the ballistic point in 2d axisymmetry .",
    "since the size of the wind - wind collision scales with the orbital separation , dramatic variations occur in systems with highly eccentric orbits , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : shkcones ] where @xmath55 ; the high eccentricity means that the shock cap at periastron has a linear scale which is 20 times smaller than that at apastron .",
    "such high eccentricities occur in two of the most well - known colliding winds systems , and wr140 , and also in psr b1259 - 63 , one of the @xmath0-ray binaries .",
    "another effect resulting from orbital motion is the aberration ( skew ) of the apex of the wcr due to the net velocity vector of the orbit ( i.e. the motion of the secondary star relative to the primary star ) .",
    "the skew angle , @xmath56 , which is the angle between the symmetry axis of the shock cap and the line of centres of the stars is approximated by @xmath57 where the speed of the slower wind is used . in the frame of the primary star , @xmath58^{1/2 } , \\label{eqn : coriolis2}\\ ] ] for stars of mass @xmath59 and @xmath60 and an orbital semi - major axis , @xmath61 .",
    "the aberration is significant in symbiotic novae because of the low wind speed of the cool star ( for instance , a symbiotic system with @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64au has @xmath65 , which is comparable to the speed of the cool wind ) .",
    "in contrast , the aberration is small in early - type binaries ( for instance , an o+o binary with @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68au has @xmath69 , which is typically much smaller than the wind speeds ) , unless the orbit has high eccentricity . in such cases",
    "the magnitude of the skew varies throughout the orbit .",
    "[ fig : skew_angle ] shows how @xmath56 varies throughout the orbit for the model a o+o star binary with parameters as in table  [ tab : models ] and with @xmath70 and 0.9 .",
    "a peak value is reached at periastron passage ( @xmath71 ) when the relative orbital speed of the stars reaches it s highest value , and the lowest value of @xmath56 occurs when the stars are at apastron ( @xmath72 ) and the relative orbital velocity is a minimum .",
    "the variation of @xmath56 between apastron and periastron increases with the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "the skew angle @xmath56 can affect the proximity of regions of the shock cap to the primary star around periastron ( fig .",

    "is then constructed by considering a sequence of previous positions of the ballistic points at the termination of the shock cap , and the current position of the gas flow from these points given that they move along linear trajectories ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cdcoords_howto ] ) .",
    "the position of points on the ballistic part of the cd ( @xmath76 , and @xmath77 ) at the time @xmath78 is given by their position at the time they were emitted from the end of the shock cap ( @xmath79 , and @xmath43 ) plus the distance they have since travelled at velocity @xmath80 , i.e.    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the time elapsed since the flow left the end of the shock cap .",

    "there is a maximum divergence of @xmath83 between cases where the transition occurs at a velocity cut - off of 70 % and 90 % of the speed of the slower wind , which shows that the resulting lightcurves are not very sensitive to this assumption .",
    "varying the orbital inclination angle changes the amount of attenuation that the intrinsic emission suffers on its way to the observer . however , there is little circumstellar attenuation for model a ( fig .",
    "[ fig : inc_lc ] , left panel ) , and the synthetic lightcurves are almost identical over the entire orbital period .",
    "this is because the emitting volume is large ( so occultation by the stars is negligible ) , and because the stellar separation is wide , so that the circumstellar density at the wcr is relatively low .",

    "enhances the attenuation around periastron .",
    "the dip seen in both the @xmath87 and @xmath88 curves is offset from the time of periastron ( @xmath89 ) because of the skew to the wcr caused by orbital motion . as already mentioned in ",

    "the @xmath90 and @xmath91 curves appear to be almost identical reflected copies around orbital phase @xmath92 , with the differences around periastron being due to the aberration of the wcr .",
    "absorption does not strongly affect the observed emission ( even if the orbital period is reduced to 1 month ) as the density contrast between the o - star winds is not very large .",

    "this simply reflects the @xmath98 smaller separation and the @xmath99 higher densities .",
    "the @xmath100 changes in the column density between apastron and periastron in model a curve reflects the @xmath101 change in stellar separation and @xmath102 change in wind density ( or stellar mass - loss rate ) as the line - of - sight switches from the secondary wind into the primary wind .",
    "the different slopes of the column density either side of periastron are caused by the asymmetry of the wcr .",
    "the rise in column density at @xmath103 begins when the shock cap rotates and lines - of - sight start to see the emission through the denser primary wind .",
    "the rise occurs at an earlier phase for the wr+o system because of the lower value of the wind momentum ratio and the narrowing of the opening angle of the wcr . at @xmath104 and 0.055 the slope in the emission weighted column",
    "is reduced , and this feature marks the point where the bow shock arms are tangential with the line - of - sight . when the emission weighted column density is plotted alongside the average column density",
    "the change in slope occurs at a point where the two curves intersect .",
    "the average column density has a continual rise and a peak at periastron .",
    "this tells us that the column density to the entire emission region reaches a maximum at periastron , whereas attenuation to the points with highest intrinsic emission remains roughly constant for a short period .",
    "it is also interesting that both the o+o and wr+o systems with @xmath105year ( model a and c respectively ) have flatter profiles at maximum column density .",
    "this indicates that the shape of the column density curve is sensitive to the aberration and orbital induced curvature of the wcr , and thus to the orbital period .",

    "spectra at apastron show lower flux in the 2.0 - 10.0 kev energy band , although flux below 1 kev is higher .",
    "this is because the intrinsic emission scales as @xmath106 , but the is weaker when viewed through the companion s wind .",
    "the low energy turnover in the periastron spectrum extends to higher energies for the wr+o system due to the higher mass - loss rate and absorption of the wr wind .",

    "we have presented a 3d dynamical model of the colliding winds in binary systems where both stars drive a significant wind . in circular systems ,",
    "the wcr adopts a spiral shaped structure similar to those observed in massive binary star systems . in systems with eccentric orbits ,",
    "the shape of the wcr becomes increasingly deformed as the eccentricity increases , with the winds increasingly being channeled into a specific direction .",
    "a major advantage of the model is its low computational cost and the fact that it can be easily adapted to model a wide variety of observational data ( from the radio to @xmath0-ray ) and systems ( from early type binaries , to @xmath0-ray binaries with a pulsar wind , to symbiotic novae ) .    as an example exercise ,",
    "the x - ray emission from hypothetical o+o and wr+o - star systems was modelled .",
    "the intrinsic emission was computed from a 2d grid - based hydrodynamical model of the wcr , and then mapped onto the surface separating the winds in the 3d dynamical model .",
    "absorption due to the unshocked stellar winds ( and also cooled postshock material ) can be considered , although in the hypothetical systems that were modelled the gas in the wcr remains largely adiabatic as it flows out of the system so that only the former is calculated .",
    "ray - tracing through the 3d spiral structures then gives the attenuated emission , and synthetic spectra and lightcurves are produced .",
    "the lightcurves and spectra show that observational characteristics of the x - ray emission from early - type binaries can be reproduced .",
    "for instance , the model with a 1 year orbit ( model a ) is representative of wide o+o binaries such as hd15558 @xcite , and in this particular system could be useful in determining whether there are two or three counterparts .",
    "the results from the 1 month orbit simulation ( model b ) are instead most applicable to x - ray observations of close o+o binaries such as @xmath107 orionis @xcite , cygob2#8a @xcite , and hd 93403 @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "the model can also tackle systems with different abundances for each wind such as wr+o - star systems .",
    "our wr+o star model with a @xmath84 year orbital period ( model c ) is applicable to systems like wr25 , wr108 , wr133 , wr138 @xcite , and among the wn stars and wr19 , wr125 , wr137 , wr98a , wr104 , and wr140 @xcite among the wc stars .",
    "mass - loss rate determinations can be made from comparison of the predicted magnitude of the x - ray flux with observations @xcite . in principle",
    "it is possible to use the shape of the x - ray lightcurve to constrain the inclination and orientation of the system .",
    "our results reveal that for wind momentum ratios of order 0.2 , the lack of significant absorption means that this will be very difficult if applied to o+o - star systems with periods of order one year , but becomes possible for orbital periods of order one month .",
    "the variation in absorption is much more significant when the wind momentum ratio is lower and the density of the winds is more disparate .",
    "this is the case for wr+o , lbv+o , and lbv+wr systems .",
