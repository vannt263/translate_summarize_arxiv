    "we see that cosmological term acts as effective friction .",
    "when universe undergoes expansion then @xmath8 and gravitational waves are damped .",
    "this situation corresponds to the present stage of the evolution .",

    "such a phase of contraction is general prediction of loop quantum cosmology ( lqc)@xcite .",
    "contracting phase appears also in the string theory based theories of the universe @xcite and many others .",
    "however in the present paper we concentrate on the lqc models where contracting and expanding regimes are joined by the phase of bounce @xcite . in the last years perturbations during the bounce phase were studied extensively .",

    "it is however worth to stress that such an approach is rather heuristic and results obtained have to be verified by the purely quantum considerations .",

    "however some recent studies show that in case of loop quantized inhomogeneous gowdy spacetime , singularity is avoided @xcite . in our approach inhomogeneities",
    "are treated perturbatively and we neglect their back - reaction on the background dynamics . however in the more detailed studies these effects have to be also taken into account . in the semi - classical approach",

    "the theory of cosmological creation of particles bases on idea of `` freezing '' of the vacuum fluctuations . on the mathematical level",

    "@xcite , the effective mass is negative in some regime and behaves like the classical one . here",

    "we matched the solutions from pre - bounce , bounce and post - bounce phases .",
    "based on this we have found power spectrum of gravitational waves and determined bogolyubov coefficients",
    ". then number of produced gravitons @xmath0 and the parameter @xmath1 were calculated .",
    "we have found that @xmath1 reaches @xmath190 which is far below any observational bounds .",
    "these results were obtained for fixed parameter @xmath191 .    based on analytical considerations",
    "we have found that power spectrum exhibits oscillations on sub - horizontal scales .",
    "an intuitive explanation of this effect was given .",
    "we have also solved the model analytically in the super - horizontal limit .",
    "these results indicate that quantum corrections do not introduce qualitative difference in the power spectrum on these scales .",
    "therefore the obtained lack of power on the large scales is a feature of the bouncing evolution and not of the quantum corrections to the mode equation .",
    "subsequently we have investigated the model numerically .",
    "we have approved presence of the oscillations emerged from the simplified analytical considerations .",
    "both numerical and analytical results were compared .",
    "we have found good qualitative and quantitative agreement .",
    "we have also approved earlier observation that quantum corrections does not introduce qualitative difference in the power spectrum .",
    "the only differences observed were in total amplitude and phase of oscillations .",
    "imposing initial instantaneous vacuum state we have also studied the low energy part of the power spectrum .",
    "therefore we have finally found the full shape of the tensor power spectrum .",
    "this spectrum can be used to study further phenomenological consequences . in particular",
    ", it can be applied as an initial condition for the inflationary modes .",
    "then we expect that the sub - horizontal part of the spectrum becomes flat while super - horizontal form survive .",
    "it is also possible that sub - horizontal oscillations survive as features of the dominant nearly flat inflationary spectrum .",
    "therefore two observational effects of the bouncing phase can be distinguished : oscillations and lack of power on the super - horizontal scales .",
    "these effects can potentially be tested with the future cmb missions like planck @xcite or proposed cmbpol @xcite .",
    "especially promising are observations of the cmb polarization . here",
    "bounce can lead to the low multipoles suppression in the b - type spectrum . at present projects like clover @xcite , quad @xcite or quiet @xcite",
    "are aiming to detect this spectrum and first results are expected in the near future . therefore it is the next step to derive quantitative predictions of the cmb features from the presented model .",

    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) describes the gravitational field as @xmath193 non - abelian gauge field using background independent methods .",
    "the canonical fields are so called ashtekar variables @xmath194 which take value in @xmath195 and @xmath196 algebras respectively and they fulfil the poisson bracket @xmath197 where @xmath198 and @xmath199 is the barbero - immirzi parameter",

    "perturbations can be split for the scalar , vector and tensor parts . for the purpose of this paper",

    "this is due to the opposite signs of the bracketed expression in equations ( [ der1app ] ) and ( [ der2app ] ) .",
    "when quantum holonomy corrections are present we have @xmath230 which can be found from background equations of motion .",
