    "the number of known msps in gcs has increased significantly in the last few years due to a number of targeted surveys ( see the review by f.  camilo and the contributions by a.  possenti and b.  jacoby in this volume ) that have benefitted from increased computational resources , new large - bandwidth pulsar backends ( primarily at 20 cm , and improved search algorithms . approximately half of the currently known @xmath080 pulsars in 23 gcs were found in the past four years . during the last three years we have been searching more than 30 gcs with the arecibo and green bank telescopes . the high time and frequency resolution of these data , along with newly developed search algorithms @xcite ,",
    "makes us significantly more sensitive than past surveys to sub - millisecond pulsations as well as to pulsars in ultra - compact binary systems . to date , we have confirmed 13 new msps in six gcs .",
    "we observed all 22 gcs visible from arecibo and within 50kpc of the sun using the l - wide receiver ( 1.1@xmath21.7ghz ) and the wideband arecibo pulsar processors ( wapps ) .",
    "the wapps are digital correlators with adjustable bandwidth , sampling time , and number of lags @xcite .",
    "our standard configuration for each wapp uses 64@xmath3s sampling ( 16-bit samples ) and 256 lags across 100mhz of bandwidth .",
    "the clusters were observed with a single wapp for the full time they are visible by arecibo , which can be up to @xmath02.75hours .",
    "we have been timing all our arecibo discoveries on a roughly monthly basis with multiple wapps and have also searched this data for pulsars that may appear only occasionally when favorable scintillation causes them to brighten .",
    "because of persistent and strong rfi from @xmath01220@xmath21360mhz , we have generally used three wapps centered at 1170 , 1420 , and 1520mhz so that the data we obtain is relatively free of rfi and suitable for searching .      in 2001",
    "september and october , during some of the first scientific observations taken with the gbt , we observed 12 globular clusters for either 4hrs ( m2 , m4 , m75 , m80 , m92 , and ngc  6342 ) or 8hrs ( m3 , m13 , m15 , m30 , m79 , and pal1 ) at l - band using one or two berkeley - caltech pulsar machines @xcite .",
    "in general , the data consisted of 96@xmath41.4mhz channels of 2 summed polarizations centered at 1375mhz and 4-bit sampled every 50@xmath3s",
    ". large quantities of both persistent and transient broadband interference and the very strong lynchburg airport radar with a period of approximately 12s have made data analysis very difficult .",
    "we have processed each observation using the presto analysis package @xcite using a computationally intensive multi - step procedure on a 52-node linux cluster at mcgill called `` the borg '' .",
    "we break each observation into small chunks of time ( @xmath020s ) and examine each frequency channel in both the time and frequency domains in order to identify ( and then mask out ) strong interference .",
    "the observations are then de - dispersed , fourier transformed , pruned of known periodic interference , and then searched using both fourier - domain acceleration searches and phase - modulation searches .",
    "we use acceleration searches on the observations as a whole and on various duration segments thereof .",
    "these acceleration searches are conducted on all clusters whether the dispersion measure is known towards it or not .",
    "finally , we fold and examine by eye all candidates above @xmath06@xmath5 that are not associated with known rfi sources .",
    "additional details of the analysis procedure can be found in @xcite .",
    "with @xmath080% of our data analyzed to our satisfaction , we have discovered and confirmed at least 13 new msps , 12 of which are in binary systems . in addition",
    ", we have at least 2 additional binary msp candidates which we believe are real , but have not ( as of yet ) confirmed .",
    "the new systems include the first pulsars discovered in four clusters : m3 , m30 , m71 , and ngc  6749 , as well as three new pulsars each in the gcs m5 and m13 . in this section",

    "these are the first pulsars discovered in this cluster , and we currently have one good , but still unconfirmed , candidate , m3c ( 2.16ms ) .",
    "none of these pulsars have an average flux density large enough to be consistently detectable with arecibo and were all discovered during favorable periods of scintillation .",
    "we have sufficiently many detections of m3b for an orbital solution , and are nearing an orbital solution for m3d ( assuming that its orbit is circular ) .",
    "we have detected m3a only three times , making it currently impossible to unambiguously determine its orbit .",
    "we note that even though we have not identified m3a in most of the observations , it is likely that intense blind folding searches near its nominal pulse period will uncover additional detections .",

    "our observations quickly uncovered an eclipsing 2.48-ms `` black - widow '' pulsar m5c in a compact 2.1hr orbit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipsers ] ) .",
    "m5c exhibits pulse arrival delays at eclipse ingress and egress by @xmath150.1ms , significantly larger than most of the other black - widow pulsars .",

    "@xcite reported the discovery of the isolated 10.4-ms pulsar m13a and the 3.5-ms binary m13b and argued that their presence in such a low density cluster required additional formation mechanisms besides two - body tidal encounters .",
    "our observations have uncovered 3 additional msps : the isolated 3.72-ms m13c , the `` normal '' binary msp 3.12-ms m13d , and the possibly eclipsing 2.49-ms m13e .",
    "m13e seems to lie in or near the `` gap '' splitting the black - widow type binaries and the more massive ter5a - like systems ( see the contribution by p.  freire in this volume ) .",
    "timing measurements of pulsars m13a@xmath2d show them all to be old ( @xmath16 yr ) with very low surface magnetic fields ( b @xmath17 g )",
    ". calculations similar to those in @xcite show that the measured spin - up of m13d constrains the mass - to - light ratio in the core of the cluster to be @xmath1 2 m@xmath18/l@xmath18 ( ransom et al .",

    "m30 is a core - collapsed cluster at a distance of @xmath08kpc . using the gbt",
    ", we discovered two msps in the cluster , one of which ( psr  j2140 - 2310a ) now has a full timing solution .",
    "m30a is an eclipsing 11-ms msp in a 4.2hr orbit where the pulsed emission is eclipsed @xmath020% of the time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipsers ] ) .",
    "arrival time delays of duration up to 1@xmath22ms are visible during eclipse ingress and egress when scintillation ( which is very strong towards the cluster ) is favorable .",
    "m30a has likely been detected in x - rays by _",
    "chandra _ and possibly in the optical by _",
    "m30b ( psr  j2140 - 23b ) is a 13-ms pulsar that we have only seen once ( but at very high significance in two pulsar back - ends ) presumably due to scintillation .",
    "the pulsar is in a very eccentric orbit ( @xmath19 ) with an orbital period of 1@xmath210days and a companion of minimum mass @xmath20 .",
    "future detections will allow the measurement of @xmath21 ( and hence the total system mass ) and probably relativistic @xmath22 which will provide the masses of both companions .",

    "m71 is another low mass and low density cluster ; however , it is relatively nearby at @xmath04kpc .",
    "we discovered the first ( and so far only ) pulsar in this cluster in our initial observation of it with arecibo .",
    "the pulsar is almost certainly a cluster member given its location @xmath00.6 core radii from the cluster center and a dm ( @xmath0117pc@xmath23 ) that is reasonably close to the prediction of the ne2001 galactic electron model ( @xmath086pc@xmath23 ; * ? ? ?",
    "m71a is yet another black - widow - like eclipsing binary ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : eclipsers ] ) with @xmath24ms and a minimum companion mass of @xmath25 . due to the relatively high dm",
    ", the pulsar does not scintillate at 20 cm , nor are delays in the pulse arrival times visible at eclipse ingress or egress .",
    "its proximity and the low density of the cluster ( i.e. less source crowding ) make m71a a good target for both optical and x - ray observations .",

    "ngc  6749 , which is at @xmath07.9kpc , has the lowest concentration ( @xmath26 ) ) and the second lowest central luminosity density of any gc with known pulsars .",
    "we have confirmed one new msp in ngc  6749 , the 3.19-ms binary ngc  6749a .",
    "this is the first pulsar in this cluster , although we have a good but unconfirmed candidate for ngc  6749b ( 4.97ms ) .",
    "timing observations are planned with arecibo and will allow us to solve the orbit of ngc  6749a , hopefully confirm ngc  6749b , and potentially uncover additional pulsars .",
    "our on - going 20-cm survey of clusters using the gbt and arecibo has been very successful , resulting in the discovery of 13 new msps .",
    "these detections have benefitted greatly from the upgraded arecibo telescope , the wapp pulsar backends , and perhaps most importantly , a prodigious amount of available computing power . the vast majority of these systems would not have been discovered without both computationally expensive acceleration searches and repeated observations of the clusters .",
    "we anticipate determining timing solutions for the majority of the systems  or at least reliable orbital parameters  within the next year .",
