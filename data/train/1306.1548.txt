    "in a @xmath5cdm universe , the smallest dark matter halos form first ; bigger halos are then formed via successive mergers with smaller halos .",
    "thus , mergers are instrumental in the formation and evolution of halos .",
    "mergers can dramatically change a galaxy  from its morphology ( e.g. , holmberg 1941 , toomre & toomre 1972 , barnes 2002 ) , to its stellar population ( e.g. , mihos & hernquist 1994 ) , to the evolution of the central supermassive black hole  ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "2006 , micic et al .",
    "consequently , merger rates have been studied extensively , both theoretically  ( e.g. , lacey & cole 1993 , genel et al .",
    "2009 ) and observationally  ( e.g. , schweizer 1986 ) .",
    "collisionless cosmological n - body simulations can be used to measure halo merger rates , where a merger is defined to occur when a bound dark matter halo falls into another bound dark matter halo .",
    "galaxy merger rates can then be inferred from the subhalo mergers within a primary halo by assuming a @xmath6 relation  ( e.g. , guo & white 2008 , wetzel et al .",
    "2009 ) or directly measured in hydrodynamic simulations  ( e.g. , maller et al .",
    "2006 , simha et al .",
    "observationally , galaxy merger rates are typically derived from close - pair counts  i.e. galaxies with small projected separations and relative velocities  and are globalized using an estimate of the lifetime or duration of the observed merger phase  ( lotz et al .",
    "2010 , zavala et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "ultimately , galaxy mergers are successful in shaping galaxy properties because they cause a large perturbation within the potential .",
    "however , one entire class of galaxy interactions also capable of causing such perturbations  galaxy flybys  has been largely ignored . unlike galaxy mergers where two galaxies combine into one remnant ,",
    "flybys occur when two independent galaxy halos interpenetrate but detach at a later time ; this can generate a rapid and large perturbation in each galaxy .",
    "we developed and tested a method to identify mergers and flybys between dark matter halos in cosmological simulations and to construct a full ` interaction network ' that assesses the past interaction history of any given halo . in this work , we present a census of halo flybys and mergers in the universe determined from cosmological simulations .",
    "please see sinha & holley - bockelmann ( 2012 ) for more details .",
    "we use a high - resolution , dark matter simulation with @xmath1 particles in a box of length @xmath7 mpc with wmap-5 cosmological parameters as a testbed to develop our technique .",
    "we use a fixed , co - moving softening length of @xmath8 kpc and evolve the particles with gadget-2  ( springel et al .  2001a , springel 2005 ) .",
    "since the fundamental mode goes non - linear at @xmath9 , we will only present results up to @xmath10 where the @xmath7 mpc box is still a representative cosmological volume . to begin identifying halos , we first use a friends - of - friends(fof ) technique with a canonical linking length @xmath11 ( @xmath12 kpc ) .",
    "we require at least 20 particles ( @xmath13 ) to define a halo , but our halo interaction network uses only those halos with greater than 100 particles .",
    "subhalos are identified using the subfind algorithm  ( springel et al .",
    "2001b ) .",
    "we classify a flyby using spatial _ and _ dynamical information .",
    "conceptually , a grazing flyby occurs when a halo undergoes the transition from a main halo @xmath14subhalo@xmath14 a main halo and is fundamentally different from mergers . however , using only this main halo @xmath14subhalo@xmath14 a main halo transition would also capture spurious interactions where one halo just skirts the outer edge of another halo .",
    "we eliminate these spurious interactions by only choosing the flybys that have a duration longer than half the crossing time .",
    "we find that with this definition the rate of flybys converges irrespective of the frequency of snapshot outputs . in a simulation",
    ", it is relatively straightforward to identify such chains since the current kinematics and future behavior of a given interaction is fully determined .",
    "we note that because flybys imply a population of galaxies that were once well within the virial radius of the main halo but are now outside it , they may be related to the so called ` backsplash ' galaxies  ( gill et al .",
    "in the left panel of figure  [ fig : rate_interactions_gyr_primary ] we show the number of flybys and mergers on a per halo per gyr basis , while the ratio of flybys to mergers is seen in the right panel .",
    "we see that flybys are more frequent for higher - mass halos at all redshifts , consistent with the @xmath5cdm framework . from the figure",
    ", we can directly see that the number of flybys becomes comparable or larger than the number of mergers for halos @xmath15 for @xmath3 .",
    "such halos are expected to host galaxies  and the effect of flybys should leave an imprint on the observable properties .",
    "we also find tentative evidence that flybys are comparable in number to mergers at the highest redshifts , @xmath16  however , the numbers are affected by poisson error and we can not conclusively say that flybys dominate mergers at those redshifts .",
    "cdm . for @xmath17 , halos above @xmath18 have flyby rates",
    "greater than 100 per gyr .",
    "such a high flyby rate ( in addition to mergers ) means these halos are unlikely to be in equilibrium . _ ( right )",
    ". _ ratio of number of flybys to mergers as a function of primary halo mass and redshift .",
    "mergers dominate flybys by an order of magnitude for @xmath19 . at lower redshifts , however , flybys start becoming more prevalent and by @xmath20 , flybys are at comparable or even larger for all halos above @xmath21 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=55.0%]cdm . for @xmath17 , halos above @xmath18 have flyby rates",
    "greater than 100 per gyr .",
    "such a high flyby rate ( in addition to mergers ) means these halos are unlikely to be in equilibrium . _ ( right ) .",
    "_ ratio of number of flybys to mergers as a function of primary halo mass and redshift .",
    "mergers dominate flybys by an order of magnitude for @xmath19 . at lower redshifts , however , flybys start becoming more prevalent and by @xmath20 , flybys are at comparable or even larger for all halos above @xmath21 . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we checked to see if there are multiple flybys between the same halo pairs and found that @xmath22 70% of the flybys do not recur .",
    "about 20% of flybys eventually become a merger and @xmath22 6% are repeated flybys .",
    "thus , flybys primarily represent one - off events between two halos .",
    "we find that a typical flyby has a relative velocity @xmath23 times the circular velocity of the primary and penetrates to @xmath24 ( up to 10% ) of the primary virial radius .",
    "such close encounters can create a strong perturbtation that potentially transform the galaxy .",
    "in this paper we report on a new class of interactions  flybys , that occur frequently .",
    "most of these flybys are one - off events  one halo delves within the virial radius of another main halo and separates at a later time .",
    "we find that the number of close flyby interactions is comparable to , or even surpasses , the number of mergers for halo masses @xmath2 at @xmath3 .",
    "we find that most flybys are one - off events and about 70% of the flybys do not ever return .",
    "in general , slow flybys cause a larger perturbation compared to a fast one , and such features can persist even when the perturbing halo has moved far away  ( vesperini & weinberg , 2000 ) .",
    "flybys are then , a largely - ignored type of interaction that can potentially transform galaxies . unfortunately , most semi - analytic methods of galaxy formation are designed only to use mergers and thus can not account for the effects of flybys directly .",
    "although the simulations outlined here pertain strictly to dark matter halo flybys , there are naturally links between these results and galaxy flybys . to better simulate the rate of galaxy flybys",
    ", we need to populate these halos with galaxies .",
    "this will allow us to constrain the actual galaxy flyby rate and to statistically compare to numerical ( e.g. , perez et al .",
    "2006 ) and observational studies of galaxy - pairs ( e.g. , nikolic et al .",
    "2004 , kewley et al .",
    "2006 , driver et al .",
