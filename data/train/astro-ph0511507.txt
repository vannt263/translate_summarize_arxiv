    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are sources of luminous x - ray emission , and at cosmological distances agn are routinely selected from deep x - ray ( @xmath9kev , _ chandra _ and _ newton - xmm ) _ exposures ( see brandt & hasinger 2005 for a recent review ) .",
    "however , obscured ( compton thick ) agn are thought to be a major contributor to the hard x - ray background ( comastri et al .",
    "1995 ) and the majority of them might not be detected in these x - ray surveys . since a large fraction of their soft x - ray ,",
    "uv and optical emission is absorbed , and presumably reradiated in the infrared ( ir ) , obscured agn are also believed to make a significant contribution to the ir and submillimeter backgrounds ( fabian & iwasawa 1999 ; almaini , lawrence , & boyle 1999 ) .",
    "fadda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) used isocam on the _ infrared space observatory _",
    "( _ iso ) _ in x - ray survey fields to estimate that x - ray emitting agn contribute up to 17% of the @xmath10 extragalactic background ( see also alexander et al . 2002 ; silva , maiolino , & granato 2004 ) .",
    "since their discovery , it has been recognized that the uv and optical continuum of luminous qsos could be described with a power law that can continue all the way into the near , mid , and even far - ir ( see e.g. , neugebauer et al .",
    "1979 ; elvis et al .",
    "this behavior often arises from the combination of a number of source components that broaden the purely stellar spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , rather than from a dominant contribution from a true power - law source ( see , e.g. , rieke & lebofsky 1981 ) .",
    "nonetheless , it is a surprisingly general characteristic . at lower luminosities , for instance x - ray selected seyfert 1 galaxies , the most common sed from the uv to the far - ir",
    "is a relatively flat @xmath11 distribution , although for some of the sources the observed seds show the effects of dust obscuration and thermal emission ( e.g. , ward et al .",
    "1987 ; carleton et al .",
    "a similar result is found for optically selected seyfert galaxies in the cfa sample , although seyfert 2 galaxies tend to have steeper ir slopes , probably due to the effects of dust emission / obscuration ( e.g. , edelson , malkan , & rieke 1987 ) .",
    "optical and ir power - law emission is also present in x - ray selected qsos ( heao , kuraszkiewicz et al . 2003 ) and near - ir selected qsos ( 2mass , wilkes et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "therefore , sensitive measurements in the ir range provide an opportunity to look for obscured agn not identified in x - ray and optical surveys .",
    "first , unlike normal and star forming galaxies whose near - ir seds are dominated by the @xmath7 m stellar bump , agn dominated galaxies ( even those obscured at optical wavelengths ) could be potentially identified through power - law emission in the rest - frame near - ir ( @xmath12 m ) .",
    "for instance , egami et al . (",
    "2004 ) have found scuba / vla sources not detected in x - rays whose seds show a power - law shape , and probably contain an agn .",
    "second , alexander et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have shown that among the most ir - luminous high-@xmath4 galaxies  those detected at high redshift with scuba  the agn fraction is high , at least 40% , suggesting that the most ir - luminous high-@xmath4 galaxies may be good candidates to host agn .",
    "very recent _ spitzer _ spectroscopy of ir luminous galaxies at @xmath13 has shown a similar fraction of galaxies containing an agn ( yan et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "in this paper we investigate the nature of galaxies selected at the _ spitzer_/mips @xmath0 m band and within the _ chandra _ deep field south ( cdfs ) , and that show power - law - like emission in the _ spitzer_/irac @xmath14 m bands . by selecting galaxies at @xmath0 m",
    "we ensure that at @xmath3 a large fraction of them will be in the ultraluminous ir galaxy ( ulirg , @xmath15 m range ( sanders & mirabel 1996 ) . ] ) class ( see prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2005 ) . throughout this paper",
    "we use @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",

    "we will only focus on the field of view ( fov ) with _ chandra _ coverage ( @xmath21 sqr arcmin , giacconi et al .",

    "psf - fitting with daophot ( stetson 1987 ) packages _ daofind , phot _ , and _ allstar _ in iraf gave positions , fluxes , and uncertainty estimates .",
    "the final 5@xmath23 flux density limit was @xmath24jy and the catalog is 80% complete at this level ( see papovich et al .",
    "we measured photometry at @xmath19 m using the @xmath0 m positions as a priori information .",
    "we used a version of the daophot / allframe package ( stetson 1994 ) , which simultaneously fits the @xmath19 m psf at the position of each @xmath0 m source in the @xmath19 m image for sources within 50  of nearby object centroids .",
    "this method has the advantage of recovering photometry from faint sources in the @xmath19 m image , even when sources are partially confused .",
    "the errors on the @xmath19 m sources include an uncertainty on the fitting of sources with overlapping isophotes , providing an estimate of the error on each source owing any source confusion .",

    "2004 ) at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and @xmath26 covering an area of @xmath27 .",
    "irac photometry began with the basic calibrated data images from the _ spitzer _ science center pipeline , version 9.5 .",
    "custom idl software projected the individual frames onto a uniform grid of 06 pixels , conserving flux and rejecting outliers such as cosmic ray hits .",
    "source detection and photometry were carried out with sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "we used a small circular aperture ( @xmath28 in diameter ) and an aperture correction to get the total flux ( assumed to be the one corresponding to a circular aperture of diameter 24.4@xmath29 ) of each source .",
    "the aperture corrections were calculated from in - flight psfs .",
    "this procedure is similar to that used by huang et al .",
    "the photometry errors take into account the irac photometric calibration uncertainty and the sextractor photometry errors .",
    "galaxies dominated by agn emission typically show a power law ( @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the spectral index ) sed at rest - frame optical , near- and mid - ir wavelengths , though with a variety of slopes .",
    "elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) showed that optically selected qsos have average optical to ir spectral indices around @xmath32 ( see also neugebauer et al .",
    "more recent results from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) show that the optical spectral indices of optically selected qsos are in the range of @xmath33 to @xmath34 ( ivezi et al .",
    "2002 , their figure 17 ) . of course",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the spectral index is the same in the near- and mid - ir .",
    "2mass qsos also show power - law - like seds in the near- and mid - ir , very similar to those of optically selected qsos , although the uv - optical continuum shape is steeper than that of optically and x - ray selected qsos ( wilkes et al .",
    "ulirgs ( @xmath35 ) containing an agn , in particular warm ulirgs , also have near and mid - ir seds resembling power laws ( see sanders et al .",
    "1988 , and more recently klaas et al . 2001 ) .",
    "some of these warm ulirgs in the local universe are also identified with optically selected qsos , and all of them are known to host an agn . moreover , warm ulirgs have been proposed as an intermediate stage in the evolution between ulirgs and qsos ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; sanders et al . 2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "thus the presence of an ir power law in lirgs and ulirgs could also be an indication of the presence of an agn .    to construct an initial power - law galaxy sample , we started with the @xmath0 m source catalog ( papovich et al .",
    "2004 ) in the fov of the x - ray _ chandra _ observations of the cdfs .",
    "we cross - correlated the positions of these @xmath0 m sources with sources detected in the four irac bands using a 1.5  search radius , and constructed observed @xmath36 m seds , requiring that the sources be detected in all four irac bands .",
    "we fitted the seds with a power law @xmath30 between @xmath37 and @xmath38 m , and minimized @xmath39 to select galaxies whose irac seds followed a power law with spectral index @xmath40 .",
    "these objects formed the candidate list for our sample , subject to construction of full seds toward shorter wavelengths .",
    "further tests of the power - law nature of these objects were used to derive the final sample , as described in the appendix .",
    "recently lacy et al . ( 2004 ) and stern et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have used irac observations of sdss qsos in the _ spitzer _ first look survey and spectroscopically confirmed agn in the botes field respectively , to derive an empirical color selection for agn .",

    "( 2004 ) show high ionization narrow lines typical of obscured type 2 agn ( see lacy et al .",
    "2005 ) demonstrating the effectiveness of this method .",
    "we note that our criteria select galaxies along a line in the irac color - color diagram , rather than using the full region identified by lacy et al .",
    "2004 ( their figure  1 ) .",
    "our approach is therefore more restrictive than theirs , since we depend entirely on the sed behavior to identify candidate agn .",
    "barmby et al .",
    "( 2005 ) present a detailed comparison between the irac power - law and the irac color - color selection methods for agn in the extended groth strip .",
    "the final sample consists of 92 galaxies referred to here as `` ir power - law galaxies '' .",
    "they have been selected without regard to x - ray properties , and should be unbiased in that respect , and can therefore be used to probe the number of x - ray quiet agn in the cdfs .",
    "thirty - seven members of the sample are also detected with mips at @xmath19 m down to a limit of @xmath41mjy .",

    "spitzer _ coordinates , flux densities and uncertainties , as well as the fitted irac spectral indices @xmath31 for the sample of ir power - law galaxies .",
    "an interesting aspect of these galaxies is that we found a maximally steep optical - to - ir slope corresponding to @xmath42 ( see table  1 ) .",

    "2004 ) , and all of them show broad lines . we have further divided the blagn galaxies in our sample into two arbitrary redshift intervals to determine if there are significant differences in their seds . *",
    "the second sed class consists of galaxies with ir seds similar to the blagn sed galaxies but whose uv and optical continua are much steeper ( obscured ) and resemble the seds of 2mass qsos ( wilkes et al .",
    "the galaxies will be referred to as narrow line agn ( nlagn ) since in terms of the optical spectroscopic classification most of these galaxies do not show broad lines . using the classifications of szokoly",

    "the last sed class is for galaxies with the steepest ir seds , resembling that of the local warm ulirg mrk  231 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "although there is no formal division between this sed class and the nlagn sed class , the ulirg sed galaxies do not show a prominent @xmath7 m stellar bump . in terms of their x - ray luminosities , three are classified by szokoly et al .",

    "2004 ) , there are three hex galaxies and one lex galaxy .    for each of the sed classes defined above , we have constructed typical seds that can be used as templates to classify the galaxies .",
    "these templates used a number of techniques such as averaging the observations of a number of galaxies to increase the signal and to smooth over individual eccentricities .",
    "as fig .  2 shows , the templates match the observations of individual galaxies well .",

    "the average templates of the high and low-@xmath4 blagn sed are very similar except that in the high-@xmath4 blagn agn the @xmath7 m stellar bump seems to be absent ( note however , that only four galaxies were used to construct this average template ) .      for galaxies showing seds resembling the blagn sed category ,",

    "as discussed by prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the main advantage of our phot - z code when used with optical to mid - ir seds is the possibility of using the @xmath7 m bump in addition to the optical stellar features routinely employed by other phot - z codes . for galaxies with such a bump , prez - gonzlez et al .",

    "rigby et al . ( 2005a ) used the same code to estimate redshifts for optically faint agn , a substantially more difficult problem than even the sources in our program .",
    "they found that the values returned were in good agreement both with redshifts from the literature , when available , and with those estimated by eye .",

    "is selected at @xmath0 m , and thus is very likely to contain a large fraction of high redshift lirgs and ulirgs , it is of interest to simulate the expected seds using local universe analogs .    warm ulirgs account for between 15 and 30% of galaxies with @xmath35 in the bright galaxy sample ( sanders et al . 1988 ) .",
    "the fraction of ir luminous galaxies ( lirgs , @xmath159 ) and ulirgs ( cool and warm ) containing an agn increases with ir luminosity ( veilleux et al .",
    "1995 , 1999 , tran et al .",
    "2001 ) ; at ir luminosities above l@xmath160 this fraction is over 50% .",
    "intense star formation in dusty galaxies , on the other hand , can also produce a bright mid - ir continuum that increases with wavelength , although the stellar bump at @xmath7 m should still be present and prominent . as shown by le floch et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and egami et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , when present in high-@xmath4 luminous ir galaxies , the @xmath7 m rest - frame stellar bump is easily recognized using optical to mid - ir seds obtained virtually identically to those used here ( that is , a combination of irac four - color photometry with data in the optical and near - ir ) .    to determine whether star - formation - dominated lirgs and ulirgs could be included in our sample ,",
    "we have compiled data for local universe lirgs with no evidence for the presence of an agn , as well as cool ulirgs .",
    "some of the galaxies in the latter category are known to host a seyfert nucleus in their centers ( e.g. , mrk  273 , ugc  5101 ) . for comparison",
    "we have also compiled data for the warm ulirgs in sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) detected in all four iras bands .",
    "these warm ulirgs are all known to contain a luminous agn .",
    "the vast majority of the data have been taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we required fairly complete seds to include galaxies in this comparison , in particular in the near and mid - ir ranges .",
    "in addition to the data from ned , we have made use of _ iso _ data for non - agn lirgs from lu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and for cool ulirgs from farrah et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , as well as optical and near - ir data from surace , sanders , & evans ( 2000 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "11 .    as expected ( upper left panel of fig .",
    "11 ) , local lirgs with no agn show a very pronounced stellar bump at @xmath7 m whereas this bump is absent or almost absent in warm ulirgs ( upper right panel of fig .",
    "cool ulirgs ( middle panel of fig .",
    "11 ) , even those containing an agn ( i.e. , ugc  5101 and mrk  273 ) , represent intermediate cases . also for those galaxies with available _ iso_/phot - s @xmath161 m spectroscopic data ( lutz et al . 1998 ; rigopoulou et al . 1999 ) , we can see that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission tends to be present in those galaxies with a strong stellar continuum .",
    "warm ulirgs ( see also seds in sanders et al .",
    "1988 ) show a range of spectral shapes , going from the typical shape of an optically selected qso ( izw1 ) or radio loud qso ( 3c273 ) , to agn with a more obscured uv and optical continuum ( e.g. , mrk  463 and mrk  231 ) .    in the lower panels of fig .",
    "11 , for a representative object of each of these classes we have redshifted the seds to the range of redshifts we may expect for galaxies in our sample .",
    "we also show for comparison purposes power laws in the irac spectral range with spectral indices @xmath162 .",
    "11 illustrates a number of important points .",
    "first , nearby ( @xmath163 ) ir bright galaxies could be included in our initial sample since their rest - frame @xmath164 m continuum rises steeply resembling the shape of a power law .",
    "however , once the complete optical to mid - ir seds are constructed , this kind of galaxy is easily identified and therefore excluded from our final sample ( see next section ) .",
    "second , cool ulirgs at @xmath165 containing a seyfert nucleus but whose near - ir continuum is dominated by stellar emission ( from either a quiescent population or a starburst ) , such as mrk  273 , will not be included in our final sample because the @xmath7 m stellar bump will get redshifted into the irac bands .",
    "agn whose ir seds are dominated by stellar emission might make up a significant fraction of the agn identified in deep x - ray surveys ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2004 ; franceschini et al .",
    "2005 ) , and are not selected with our criteria .",
    "lastly , for galaxies at @xmath80 not showing a very steep ( @xmath166 ) irac continuum we may not be able to distinguish between the sed of a warm and a cool ulirg . in such cases , we will have to use other criteria ( i.e. , x - ray and ir luminosities ) to determine whether they are likely to contain an agn .",
    "as an illustration , in fig .",
    "12 we show two of the galaxies eliminated from the sample whose seds resemble that of a normal galaxy . both are two nearby ( @xmath167 ) galaxies dominated by stellar emission but showing a steeply rising rest - frame @xmath164 m continuum .",
    "although they passed screening for the initial sample , they are easily recognized as _ normal galaxies from the optical to mid - ir sed , as they show the typical sed of a spiral galaxy with a prominent @xmath7 m stellar bump .",
    "_    normal galaxies in our sample are also obvious because they are optically bright with respect to their x - ray fluxes ( or to the upper limits to the fluxes  see further discussion in  7.1 ) .",
    "of the two galaxies shown in fig .",
    "12 , one has a spectroscopic redshift from the vvds , and for the second one we use our own phot - z ( see fig .",
    "we find that both galaxies have x - ray upper limits to the _ chandra _ full - band luminosity of @xmath168 , well below the typical luminosity of a seyfert nucleus .",
