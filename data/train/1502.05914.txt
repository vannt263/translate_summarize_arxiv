    "symmetries play a fundamental role in our search for the physical laws in nature .",
    "significant theoretical and phenomenological advances have been obtained using models characterized by global symmetries , including the existence of forbidden bands of wave propagation in infinite periodic structures ( bloch theorem )  @xcite and the existence of even or odd eigenstates in problems that involve potential with global inversion symmetry ( parity theorem )  @xcite . however , global symmetry and its consequences constitutes an idealized scenario , requiring often a sophisticated preparation procedure to be experimentally probed .",
    "opposite to this , a frequently encountered scenario in nature concerns complex systems with a variety of symmetries valid in limited spatial domains of the entire embedding space  @xcite . for their characterization",
    "we apply here the term _ local symmetries _ and their emergence can be attributed to mechanisms of global symmetry breaking leading to new symmetries ( remnants ) at different scales .",
    "indeed , such spatially localized symmetries can be intrinsic in complex physical systems like large molecules  @xcite , quasicrystals  @xcite , or even in partially disordered matter  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , since technological advances often require tailored structures suitable for corresponding applications , local symmetries can be present by design in multilayered photonic devices  @xcite , semiconductor superlattices  @xcite and magnonic systems  @xcite .",
    "acoustic  @xcite and phononic  @xcite structures have attracted increasing interest in this direction . despite the fact that systems belonging to the aforementioned classes have been extensively investigated @xcite ,",
    "the impact of their local symmetries has not been explored thoroughly .",
    "the natural step beyond the above ascertainment would be to investigate whether -and how- these locally existing symmetries carry imprints of the equivalent global symmetries and in turn , by which procedure these could be used to derive structural characteristics of the scattered wave field .",
    "recently , we developed a rigorous formalism  @xcite in order to describe the impact of local symmetries in one - dimensional , lossless scattering setups .",
    "to this aim we employed a generic wave mechanical framework -equally applicable to acoustics , photonics and quantum mechanics- described by the generalized helmholtz equation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the complex wave field and @xmath2 is the potential which describes the inhomogeneities of the medium . for the case of acoustic waves ,",
    "on which this work focuses , @xmath1 corresponds to the pressure field @xmath3 .    in one dimension ,",
    "the basic symmetry transformations are reflection through a point @xmath4 and translation by a length @xmath5 , both described by the form @xmath6 , allowing for a unified description as : ( i ) reflection : @xmath7 , ( ii ) translation : @xmath8 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath2 obeys the symmetry @xmath9 within an arbitrary domain @xmath10 . if @xmath11 then the symmetry is _ global_. in any other case the symmetry will be regarded as _",

    "note , that in the extreme case of a total symmetry breaking ( e.g. strong disorder ) @xmath30 becomes a function of @xmath15 , lacking the property of constancy , as a result of the lack of any symmetric region residing in the potential landscape . in this sense ,",
    "a nonvanishing @xmath17 value points to the globally broken symmetry , whereas its constancy , evinces the presence of local order and is interpreted as a _ remnant _ of the corresponding broken global symmetry .",

    "the sound source is a piezo - electric buzzer embedded in the impedance sensor ( see @xcite for details ) which is placed at one end of the main tube .",
    "this sensor is used for the calculation of the transmission diagram and for the measurements of the pressure fields inside the lattice at prescribed frequencies . at the other end of the tube ,",

    "a @xmath38 inch microphone ( b&k 4136 ) , carefully calibrated , is used , placed after the last hole , for the calculation of the transmission coefficient and a @xmath39 inch microphone ( gras type 26ac ) within the tube for field measurements .",
    "the frequency range of the applied signal is below the first cutoff frequency of the waveguide , @xmath40 hz , and thus the propagation can be considered one - dimensional .",

    "the hole impedance @xmath69 is a complex function of the wavenumber , while the real part @xmath70 accounts for dissipation",
    ".      the sound waves that propagate in the proposed acoustic structure are subject to two different kinds of losses .",

    "viscothermal losses are taken into account by considering a complex expression for the wave number . in our case",

    "scatterer losses are taking into account in the real part of the acoustic impedance of the holes .",
    "they come from viscothermal losses at the boundaries of the holes wall and radiation losses to the outer environment .",

    "the transmission spectra and the control of their properties in aperiodic , inhomogeneous media is a field of intense study among a large class of wave scattering systems  @xcite .",
    "the design of our experimental setup has been based on the ( lossless ) construction rules  @xcite for perfect transmission resonances , which provide the technique for the design of setups which are transparent at preselected frequencies .    in general ,",
    "isolated perfect transmission resonances are expected to occur in reflection symmetric _ lossless _ systems . on the contrary , in aperiodic , nonsymmetric systems ,",
    "the transmission spectrum is usually characterized by @xmath90 , where t is the transmission coefficient .",
    "nevertheless , the possible complete decompositions of an aperiodic cls setup into locally reflection symmetric potential parts , has a major impact on its transmission properties and particularly on the emergence of perfect transmission resonances .",

    "@xmath97-ptrs : the procedure to construct an asymmetric ptr requires to divide the setup into two arbitrary ( not necessarily reflection symmetric ) parts @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",

    "@xcite are satisfied . in this case",
    ", the spatial profile of the wave field does not follow any ( local ) symmetry within the corresponding setup .",
    "based on the aforementioned construction technique we theoretically design a setup which -in the lossless case- manifests both kinds of ptrs .",
    "subsequently , the emerging geometric characteristics ( @xmath88-barrier strengths and their distances ) are implemented in the fabrication of the acoustic waveguide . in order that the experimental procedure yields satisfactory results , attenuation should be taken into account and controlled .",
    "therefore , to minimize the propagation losses , the waveguide has to be relatively short , of the order of one meter .",
    "radiation losses , on the other hand , are enhanced as the number of the scatterers ( holes ) increases , due to the acoustic radiation to the outer environment .",
    "an optimal choice which satisfies these experimental objectives is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and described below . nevertheless , the emerging ( acoustic ) structure can be considered as a weakly lossy system .",
    "let us note that the periodic / aperiodic distribution of strong losses can lead to interesting phenomena like formation of antibandgap  @xcite .",
    "the final aperiodic cls setup is comprised of seven scatterers of two different potential strengths @xmath100 and @xmath101 corresponding to holes of radii @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively ( for the calculation of potential strengths , we use eq .",

    "this free parameter will be utilized for the construction of an additional @xmath97-ptr in the following manner : by identifying two parts of the device i.e. @xmath111 , we calculate independently their transmission spectra and seek for frequencies with common transmission coefficient .",

    "we find that the @xmath97-ptr occurs when @xmath113  m.      in  @xcite , it has been shown that in the case of scattering systems characterized by a globally broken discrete symmetry , a nonvanishing non - local , spatially invariant current @xmath17 exists that characterizes the symmetry breaking .",
    "this analysis , however , concerned lossless idealized systems . in experimental , realistic setups losses are inevitable and their theoretical account is necessary to accurately describe or predict the expected outcome . in the following ,",
    "we develop a formalism which systematically describes the breaking of discrete symmetries in systems with attenuation and we elucidate how the quantity @xmath17 is affected .",
    "losses may emerge either during the propagation or locally at the scatterer points due to acoustic radiation to the outer environment and viscothermal effects .",
    "propagation losses for structures of small length can safely be neglected when compared with the attenuation emerging from the local scatterers .",
    "this means that the impedance of the hole becomes a complex function and therefore the potential obtains the following form : @xmath114    the condition that allows the applicability of the theory is that both the real and the imaginary parts of the potential @xmath2 obey the linear symmetry transform @xmath9 for @xmath115 .",

    ", we perform a fitting procedure with a plane wave function of complex wavenumber @xmath158 given by the expression @xmath159 we fit simultaneously the real and imaginary parts of the experimental pressure field using @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 as shared parameters for the two datasets ( real , imaginary part ) . when the parameter @xmath166 is zero , the fitting function corresponds to the real part of the field , whereas for @xmath167 eq .",
    "( [ plane_wave ] ) corresponds to the imaginary part .",
    "then , keeping the complex wave number fixed , we find the plane wave parameters @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "however , around the holes , the scattered waves have an evanescent part with 3d characteristics which locally alter the plane wave description .",
    "thus , we ignore the experimental points residing in the areas which extend one millimetre on either side of each hole and where a deviation from the plane wave description occurs .",
    "the remaining experimental points comprise five regions -three in the domain @xmath104 and two in the domain @xmath105- where the plane wave approximation is accurate .",
    "thus , we perform a separate fitting procedure in each of these five regions . the invariant currents @xmath17 are determined by using the results of the fitting procedure in eq .",

    "figures  [ fig4 ] ( c ) , ( d ) illustrate the corresponding results for @xmath170 and @xmath171 , as emerged from the latter .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ lossy_bl_par_3 ] ) becomes zero at the mirror axis position of each domain and the expression becomes indeterminate .",
    "a more accurate approach of this vicinity would require more experimental data points .",
    "therefore we have ignored a small area around the domain center .",
    "this also causes the observed increasing trend as the center of the domains is approached .",
    "the small fluctuations of the values of @xmath170 and @xmath171 are inevitable since the experimental points deviate from the exact plane wave which would be the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : etp ] ) .      comparing the results of the two approaches it is obvious that they are in very good agreement and",
    "the constancy of @xmath17 in the symmetry domains becomes evident , verifying the theoretical prediction .",
    "in particular , since our structure is composed of two local symmetry subdomains @xmath27 , according to the lossless theory  @xcite the magnitude of the invariant currents @xmath170 in each domain at the ptr frequencies should be the same . at any other non - ptr frequency , the magnitudes of the invariant currents @xmath17 is constant in each domain of the selected decomposition , but they differ from each other .",
    "in the first place , both for theory and experiment ( see figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) and ( c ) ) , we observe that in the presence of attenuation , @xmath170 is different at the two decomposition domains even at the ptr frequencies , thereby deviating from the lossless theory . using the theoretical transmission matrix method and tuning the total amount of losses from zero up to the expected value",
    ", we observe that as attenuation increases , the larger the difference between @xmath170 in @xmath104 and @xmath105 , becomes . on the other hand , for a given amount of losses",
    "which is kept fixed , by changing the frequency , we observe that this difference is minimized at the @xmath92-ptr frequency , being in accordance to the lossless theory @xcite .",
    "an additional feature which is observed in the plane wave fitting method and is worth - mentioning , concerns the small gaps which appear in the experimental data within the domain @xmath104 ( resp .",
    "@xmath105 ) and particularly between the first ( or third for @xmath104 ) region and the second .",
    "this can be explained by the three - dimensional nature of the problem in the vicinity of the holes .",
    "this feature alters the solution from one region to the other , leading to disconnected plane wave solutions for each one of the three regions , instead of the exact , continuous plane wave for the whole first domain , as in the case of the theoretical results .",
    "this difference in the plane wave solutions is therefore translated into a gap for @xmath170 and @xmath173 .    concluding this subsection",
    ", we point out that a complete constancy of @xmath17 would be feasible if the pressure field in every symmetry domain was a perfect plane wave , satisfying the 1d helmholtz equation . the deviation of the experimental curve from the exact functional form of the plane wave results in a gap in domain @xmath104 when the fitting procedure is followed or in small fluctuations when the calculation is performed via eq .",

    ", having already identified the constancy of @xmath17 in the presence of losses , we experimentally verify the generalization of the parity theorem in the case of complete local reflection symmetry in the presence of losses . to this aim , we utilize the aperiodic setup considered above ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) and use the measured @xmath17s and pressure fields for the frequencies @xmath174 and @xmath150 .",
    "the mapping between the symmetry related regions is provided by eq .",

    "[ fig5 ] the real and imaginary parts of the pressure field are illustrated for the selected @xmath92-ptr ( @xmath146 hz ) , @xmath97-ptr ( @xmath147 hz ) and non - ptr ( @xmath156 hz ) frequencies .",
    "to investigate the validity of the above mapping relation expressed in eq .",
    "( [ lossy_bl_par_3 ] ) , we employ as input parameters the experimental pressure field at the left side of each mirror symmetry axis , represented by the green ( small ) circles and the @xmath17 values obtained by the fitting procedure , presented in the previous section ( fig .",

    "in particular , we extend the theory by incorporating losses and ascertain that the symmetry induced invariant current @xmath17 preserves its spatial constancy in the presence of attenuation .",
    "the fact that broken discrete symmetries , retained at spatially limited domains , induce invariant currents , has been experimentally verified here for the case of locally reflection symmetric setups . in turn , we showed how @xmath17 generalizes the bloch and parity theorems for scattering systems with broken global translation and reflection symmetry , respectively , by defining a mapping of the pressure field between the symmetry related regions .",

    "it has been demonstrated how @xmath17 constitutes the key - tool towards a systematic description of discrete symmetry breaking . in this context",
    ", we showed that in a globally reflection symmetric setup which sustains losses , @xmath170 provides the lossy analogue to the energy current j of the lossless case .",
    "finally , the construction procedure for the design of acoustic waveguides with prescribed perfect transmission properties and the subsequent experimental implementation reveals how the class of cls materials could pave the way towards the design of materials with very specialized filtering capabilities .",
