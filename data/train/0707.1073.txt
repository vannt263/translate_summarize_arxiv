    "since its uncovering , chaotic advection @xcite has drawn much attention as its consequences on both transport and mixing properties of a given flow are fundamental .",
    "this phenomenon is intimately related to lagrangian chaos , and translates the fact that despite the laminar character of a flow lagrangian trajectories of a fluid or passive particles may end up being chaotic . in this",
    "setting , transport and mixing properties are drastically changed @xcite . in chaotic regions of the flow ,",
    "mixing induced by molecular diffusion becomes often negligible in regards to the mixing induced by the dynamics .",
    "regarding transport properties , the triggering of chaotic advection also plays a key role . indeed , in contrast to",
    "the fully predictive integrable situation , tackling transport properties of individual passive particles is subject to sensitivity to initial conditions and implies a necessary probabilistic approach .",
    "this leads in some cases to a diffusion equation with an enhanced diffusion coefficient when compared to the molecular diffusion one @xcite , but also to non - gaussian properties of transport ( see for instance@xcite ) , as for instance super - diffusive transport .",
    "one then often resorts to modeling transport using a fractional diffusion equation @xcite .",
    "all these properties have drawn much attention not only for its impact on geophysical flows and magnetized plasmas @xcite , but also because of the potential applications of its enhanced mixing properties in chemical engineering and micro - fluidic devices @xcite .",
    "lagrangian chaos in two dimensional incompressible flows is triggered generically when the flow becomes time - dependent@xcite .",
    "the trajectories of fluid particles or passive tracers are not confined on field lines and chaos appears . for these type of flows the dynamics of fluid particles",
    "is hamiltonian , with the stream function acting as the hamiltonian .",
    "the canonically conjugate variables are the space variables , and the phase space is the two dimensional physical space .",
    "this particularity allows direct visualization of phase space in experiments , making it a test bed used to confront theoretical results on hamiltonian dynamics with experiments .",
    "more specifically , passive tracer dynamics belong to the class of hamiltonian systems with one and a half degrees of freedom .",
    "general mixing and transport properties of these systems are now well understood , especially when the time dependence is periodic and poincar maps are computed to analyze phase space topology .",
    "typically the dynamics is not ergodic  : a chaotic sea surrounds various islands of quasi - periodic dynamics .",
    "the anomalous transport properties and their multi - fractal nature are then linked to the existence of islands and the phenomenon of stickiness observed around them @xcite , while mixing is enhanced in the chaotic sea but has to rely on molecular diffusion in regular regions .    in most studies regarding this type of phenomena , the time dependent perturbation is given a priori or self - generated .",
    "transport and mixing properties are thoroughly investigated and general laws are extrapolated or the origin of phenomena explained ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the influence of phase space topology and its understanding is clear , and can be used to explain synchronization phenomena @xcite .",
    "however one is still somewhat constrained by an a priori imposed time dependence .",
    "recently , approaches of tailoring specific perturbations in order to modify phase space have been proposed @xcite and a specific one has been applied to an array of alternating vortices @xcite . due to the strong influence of invariant tori forming regular islands on global transport and mixing properties , acting on phase space topology even locally",
    "( for instance , by building a transport barrier @xcite or by destroying regular islands @xcite ) can have strong consequences .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of targeted mixing , a work already started in ref .",
    "we refer to targeted mixing as the process of leveraging only one of the consequences of chaotic advection , namely enhancing mixing , while containing particle transport within a finite sub - domain of phase space . for this purpose",
    "we consider the dynamics of passive particles in an array of alternating vortices and tailor phase space in order to achieve the desired property . from the experimental point of view , acting on phase space is often not easy , because one has to act also on particle momenta in general .",
    "however this may be less of a problem in the context of two - dimensional incompressible flows due to the duality between physical space and phase space .",
    "moreover mixing within flows has a tremendous number of applications .",
    "the primary interest in the flow of an array of alternating vortices resides in the fact that being generated by quite a few hydrodynamic instabilities , it may be considered as one of the founding bricks of turbulence .",
    "this flow is easily accessible to experimentalists for instance using magnetohydrodynamics techniques similar to rayleigh - bnard convection with a control over the flow  @xcite . as such , understanding its influence on the advection of passive or active quantities is considered a necessary first step in order to uncover the different mechanisms governing transport in general or reaction - diffusion processes such as front propagation in turbulent flows  @xcite . the stream function which models",
    "an experiment in a channel with slip boundary conditions writes : @xmath0 where the @xmath1-direction is the horizontal one along the channel and the @xmath2-direction is the bounded vertical one .",
    "the dynamics given by the stream function  ( [ psi0 ] ) is integrable and passive particles follow the stream lines , no mixing occurs . in the experiments ,",
    "a typical perturbation @xmath3 is introduced as a time dependent forcing in order to trigger chaotic advection and then to study the resulting transport and mixing properties .",
    "more precisely we consider perturbations which modify the stream function as : @xmath4    we show how to identify the perturbations @xmath5 which preserve transport barriers and at the same time , enhance mixing properties .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : definition - and - short ] we recall some basic notions of passive scalar dynamics in two dimensional incompressible flows . then we give a short review of possible hamiltonian control techniques we use in order to tailor a perturbation best suited for our needs . in sec .",
    "[ sec : achieveing - targeted - mixing ] , we apply these techniques to flows modeled by the stream function ( [ psi0 ] ) .",
    "first we derive the perturbation needed in order to build virtual barriers along the channel and thus limit transport within only a small region of phase space . then among all possible perturbations ,",
    "we define criteria needed to achieve good mixing within the two barriers and analyze for which perturbations and parameters these criteria are satisfied .",
    "then , we consider the robustness of the proposed perturbation with respect to a simpler time dependence , slip boundary conditions , three dimensional effects and molecular diffusivity . after showing the efficiency of such perturbations in enhancing mixing",
    ", we analyze the set of parameters for which efficient mixing is expected using the residue method .",
    "the term advection by definition , relates to the action of being moved by and with a flow . in mathematical terms , this translates in the general equation for a passive tracer:@xmath6 where @xmath7 locates the passive tracer in space , @xmath8 corresponds to the velocity field , and @xmath9 corresponds to the time derivative of @xmath7 . in the case of two dimensional incompressible flows , the study of the field can be described by a scalar function , i.e the stream function @xmath10 . the velocity field",

    "( [ psic ] ) and its parameters .",
    "these techniques will be subsequently used to achieve targeted mixing for the considered flows , namely construct a perturbation in order to obtain optimal chaotic mixing in a localized region of phase space .",
    "first we construct a family of perturbations which create transport barriers , then we use the residue method  @xcite in order to find optimal mixing regimes in parameter space after the barriers have been created .",
    "we consider a generic time - independent stream function ( hamiltonian ) @xmath17 describing a fluid in a two - dimensional channel of height @xmath18 , i.e.  @xmath19 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : canal ] ) .",
    "we assume that there exists an invariant curve which prevents the advection of tracers from the left to the right of that curve .",
    "we denote the equation of this curve @xmath16 . the invariance condition [ @xmath20 if @xmath16 ] of tracers on this curve translates into  : @xmath22 for all @xmath23 $ ] by using eqs .  ( [ eq : hamilton_advec ] ) . in the case of eq .",
    "( [ psi0 ] ) , this transport barrier is a heteroclinic connection between two hyperbolic fixed points located at @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    in order to enhance mixing ,",
    "the system is perturbed by a time - dependent forcing ( depending also on @xmath1 and @xmath2 in general ) . as a consequence ,",
    "its dynamics is generically no longer integrable , and chaotic trajectories fills portions of the channel ( these are parts where mixing occurs ) .",
    "however , as a side effect , the transport barrier is broken and trajectories start to diffuse along the channel ( in the @xmath1-direction ) .    in the following ,",
    "we propose to design a time - dependent forcing of the flow described by @xmath26 which preserves the transport barrier as well as the chaotic mixing .",
    "the aim is to find an appropriate forcing which preserves a bounded domain of the channel with an enhanced chaotic mixing inside .",
    "this domain can be bounded by two dynamical barriers as mentioned above .",

    "these solutions are obtained by using more complex translation functions @xmath32 .",
    "however , they contain a lot more fourier modes in @xmath2 , which make them more difficult to implement for the cases we consider in sec .",
    "[ sec : achieveing - targeted - mixing ] .",
    "we notice that the perturbation @xmath5 given by eq .",
    "( [ pert ] ) as well as the equation of the transport barrier  ( [ barrier ] ) are parameterized by a time - periodic function @xmath39 .",
    "this function @xmath42 is in general parameterized by essentially two parameters , its frequency and its amplitude . in parameter space ,",
    "the dynamics characterized by the stream function @xmath47 exhibit drastically different behaviors depending on the values of parameters . in what follows , we use periodic orbits to determine the regions in parameter space where complete mixing inside the transport barriers occurs . this method is briefly explained in the next section .",
    "the dynamics of the perturbed flow as the one given by the stream function @xmath47 can be investigated by looking at the ( linear ) stability of specific periodic orbits , using indicators such as the _",
    "residue_. in order to `` control '' the flow , one can monitor the residues by varying the parameters of the system ( like the frequency and the amplitude of the forcing ) , until specific bifurcations occur .",
    "in particular , the residue method allows one to predict the break - up ( or creation ) of invariant tori , which entails an enhancement ( or reduction ) of chaotic mixing .",
    "we consider a hamiltonian flow with 1.5 degrees of freedom which depends on a set of parameters @xmath49  :    @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in order to analyze the linear stability properties of the associated periodic orbits , we also consider the jacobian @xmath53 which evolves according to the tangent flow written as  @xcite  : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the two - dimensional identity matrix and @xmath56 is the hessian matrix ( composed of second derivatives of @xmath15 with respect to its canonical variables ) . for a given periodic orbit with period @xmath57 ,",
    "the linear stability properties are given by the spectrum of the two - dimensional monodromy matrix @xmath58 .",
    "these properties can be synthetically captured in greene s definition @xcite of the residue  : @xmath59 since @xmath60 . in particular , if @xmath610,1[$ ] , the periodic orbit is elliptic ; if @xmath62 or @xmath63 it is hyperbolic ; and if @xmath64 and @xmath65 , it is parabolic .",
    "the residues of a set of well selected periodic orbits provide - through linear stability analysis - information to detect the enhancement as well as the reduction of chaotic mixing  @xcite .",
    "the actual change of dynamics has to be checked a posteriori by a nonlinear stability analysis ( a poincar section for instance ) .",
    "the residues are used to discard regions in parameter space where large elliptic islands are present .    for this purpose ,",
    "an alternative strategy is to use a `` brute force '' method and scan a whole range of physically relevant parameters , analyze transport and mixing properties ( by a poincar map inspection for instance ) and conclude on a domain of parameters where optimal mixing is achieved . though it would be a complete analysis , this strategy is not reasonable to adopt because of the high number of cases to consider and also the computer time it takes to analyze a single case .    in order to circumvent these difficulties we choose to consider the residue method described in this section and follow in parameter space the stability of a well selected set of periodic orbits .",
    "indeed due to the hamiltonian nature of passive particles , one can expect a direct correspondence between non - mixing regions in physical space and islands of stability in phase space .",
    "the higher the period of the island the smaller is its size , hence by following the linear stability of elliptic periodic orbits with small period in parameter space , one should be able to define a potential optimal mixing region for which these orbits are unstable and associated with a mixing enhancement .",
    "once this set of main periodic orbits has been defined by close inspection of several situations , the mixing region is obtained by looking at the bifurcation curves in parameter space , e.g. , the set of parameters such that the residue is equal to one  @xcite .",
