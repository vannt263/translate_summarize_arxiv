    "at low energies , the standard model can be described in terms of an effective theory , involving only the lightest states as explicit degrees of freedom . in order",
    "that such an effective description becomes possible , two requirements need to be met .",
    "first , one must have a clear separation of scales ( mass gap ) between , on the one side , the light states , and , on the other side , the heavy states , which appear only indirectly in the effective theory , through their contribution to the infinite number of couplings , the low energy constants ( lecs ) describing the local interactions of the light states .",
    "the second requirement is that the masses of the light degrees of freedom are protected by some symmetry , in order that their lightness appears as natural , in the very precise sense defined by t  hooft@xcite some time ago . in practice",
    ", this means that light spin 0 states have to correspond to goldstone bosons produced by the spontaneous breaking of some continuous global symmetry .",
    "the masses of light fermion will be protected by chiral symmetry , whereas gauge invariance will ensure that spin 1 gauge fields remain massless ( or massive but light , in the presence of a higgs mechanism ) .",
    "in the case of the standard model , the light degrees of freedom that can be identified in this way comprise : i ) the pseudoscalar meson octet , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which , in the limit of massless quarks , become the goldstone bosons associated with the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry of qcd , ii ) the light leptons , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and their neutrinos ( in principle , one might add the @xmath9 neutrino to this list , although the @xmath9 lepton itself belongs to the heavy states in the context of the present discussion ) , and iii ) the photon .",
    "the range of applicability of this effective theory is limited by the typical mass scale @xmath10 gev provided by the non goldstone mesonic bound states .",
    "notice that according to the criteria adopted above , other effective theories could be considered , for instance the one involving only the electron , the three neutrinos , and the photon , with the limiting mass scale set by @xmath11 , etc .",
    "chiral perturbation theory@xcite ( chpt ) organizes the low energy effective theory in a systematic expansion in powers of momenta and of light    0.1 in    . _",
    "the low energy constants corresponding to some of the parts of @xmath12 that have been constructed .",
    "they allow for a description of meson scattering amplitude and meson form factors up to two loops , anf for the inclusion of @xmath13 radiative corrections up to one loop . _ [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    masses .",
    "the most convenient tool to materialize this expansion is to construct an effective lagrangian @xmath14 , where @xmath15 contains all the terms of order @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , for instance , modulated by lecs whose values depend on the dynamical properties of the heavy degrees of freedom that have been integrated out . at lowest order ,",
    "one only needs to compute tree graphs generated by @xmath18 , whereas the nlo involves both tree graphs from @xmath19 and one loop graphs , and so on .",
    "it is essential to include the loop graphs , with increasing number of loops at each new order , in order to correctly account for all the singularities ( poles , cuts ) coming from the light degrees of freedom .",
    "computing higher orders in the effective theory potentially increases the theoretical precision .",
    "however , the number of lecs also increases , as shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "predictions can thus only be made if some knowledge about their values is available .",
    "how this problem can be adressed in practice will be illustrated in the case of the few examples discussed below .",
    "as a first application , let us consider the @xmath13 electromagnetic contributions to the semileptonic decays of the pion and the kaon .",
    "the general structure of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 decay rates with radiative corrections included is known@xcite @xmath23\\ ] ] with @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "chpt reproduces this structure , with @xmath26 .",
    "the expressions@xcite for the @xmath27 contributions @xmath28 involve a ( common ) short distance logarithm@xcite , chiral logarithms , and the low energy constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 , while @xmath31 and higher represent su(3 ) breaking quark mass corrections .",
    "interestingly , the contributions of the low energy constants drop out@xcite in the @xmath13 correction to @xmath32 , @xmath33 with @xmath34 given by @xmath35 , and the error is a conservative estimate for su(3 ) breaking corrections .",
    "this then leads to @xmath36 where the first error comes from the experimental uncertainties on the decay rates , and the second error comes from eq .",
    "( [ ckcpi ] ) .",
    "turning now to @xmath22 , the general structure of the amplitudes reads @xmath37\\ , .",
    "\\label{kl3amp}\\ ] ] for the @xmath38 modes , only @xmath39 needs to be considered , whereas for the @xmath40 modes @xmath41 has to be included as well .",
    "the chiral expansions of these form factors read @xmath42 and @xmath43 the one loop corrections @xmath44 arising from mesonic intermediate states , including isospin breaking effects induced by @xmath45 , are known@xcite for quite some time .",
    "including @xmath13 radiative corrections@xcite amounts to replacing @xmath46 by @xmath47\\times \\big({\\widetilde f}_{\\pm}(t ) + { \\widehat f}_{\\pm}(t)\\big)\\,.\\ ] ] in this expression , @xmath48 contains corrections from the loops and from @xmath49 mixing , while @xmath50 collects the remaining counterterm contributions .",
    "finally , @xmath51 , with @xmath52 for @xmath53 , and @xmath52 for @xmath54 , contains the long distance components of the loops with a virtual photon .",
    "the ir divergence , materialized by the dependence on the photon mass @xmath55 , is cancelled upon considering the differential rates with the emission of a real soft photon .",
    "corrections at order @xmath56 were computed@xcite and the corresponding numerical estimates read @xmath57\\ ] ] @xmath58\\ ] ] the expressions of the two loop corrections @xmath59 were worked out@xcite in the isospin limit , and will be discussed below .",
    "the beta decay of the charged pion ( @xmath61 ) in principle provides a determination of @xmath0 which combines the advantages of the superallowed nuclear fermi transitions ( pure vector transition , no axial vector admixture ) , and of the neutron beta decay ( no nuclear structure dependent radiative corrections ) .",
    "there is however a serious drawback , the tiny branching ratio , br@xmath62 . in the absence of radiative corrections , the amplitude has the structure given in eq .",
    "( [ kl3amp ] ) , with @xmath63 replaced by @xmath64 , and @xmath65 replaced by @xmath66 .",
    "contribution from @xmath67 are suppressed by @xmath68 and can be neglected .",
    "furthermore , @xmath69 , where the one loop corrections@xcite to the cvc result are small , @xmath70 . as a consequence ,",
    "higher order corrections , @xmath71 , etc .",
    ", can be safely neglected . on the other hand , radiative",
    "corrections then become relevant . including @xmath56 effects gives@xcite @xmath72 radiative corrections",
    "enhance the branching ratio by @xmath73 .",
    "the ( very small ) uncertainties come from the counterterm contributions .",
    "it is thus possible to give a very accurate prediction for @xmath74 in chpt . with the latest result@xcite of the pibeta experiment , the relative precision on @xmath0 obtained this way",
    "is still limited by the experimental precision @xmath75",
    "the situation is somewhat less ideal for the @xmath22 decays , since the corrections are larger , and the one loop result is not sufficient for an accurate determination@xcite of @xmath1 .",
    "the nnlo expressions for the @xmath22 form factors @xmath65 decompose into a two loop part , which depends only on the masses and on @xmath76 , a one loop part involving the @xmath77 s , and a tree level contribution depending on some of the @xmath78 lecs @xmath79 .",
    "it should be stressed that the estimate of @xmath80 given in ref.@xcite is neither a two loop calculation , nor an estimate of the lecs that enter the two loop expression .",
    "while the lecs giving the @xmath81 and the @xmath82 terms of @xmath39 can in principle be obtained from the experimental measurements of the slope @xmath83 and the curvature @xmath84 , there remain two unknown lecs in @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the important observation@xcite here is that these same two lecs also appear in a combination of the scalar form factor @xmath88 and of @xmath89 .",
    "for instance , @xmath90 @xmath91 in the kinematical region of interest , the known function @xmath92 is well approximated by a polynomial@xcite , @xmath93 .",
    "thus , one may extract @xmath86 from the knowledge of the curvature @xmath94 of @xmath88 , and then get @xmath87 from its slope @xmath95 _ provided @xmath89 is known_. the reason for the emphasis@xcite here comes from the fact that the value usually quoted , @xmath96 , actually results from the analysis of ref.@xcite , and thus can not be used _ a priori_. the effect of a variation in @xmath89 on @xmath85 reads , @xmath97 and even a variation of @xmath89 as small as a few percents directly affects the value of @xmath85 , and thus the determination of @xmath1 , by about the same relative amount .",
    "this assumes that all the dependence on @xmath89 is explicitly shown in eqs .",
    "( [ lambda0 ] ) and ( [ c0 ] ) .",
    "the situation is however more complicated , since the values of the coefficients @xmath98 depend on the values of the @xmath77 s , which are obtained from a fit@xcite to various input observables , _ including the fixed value _",
    "a more accurate description of the dependence on @xmath89 therefore requires to perform this fit for different values of this ratio , in the range , say , from @xmath99 to @xmath100 , expressing , for instance , the numerical coefficients @xmath98 in the form @xmath101 , etc .",
    "the situation is thus similar to the one encountered previously in a different , but not unrelated , context@xcite , and the strategies to extract @xmath1 discussed there may be easily adapted . from eq .",
    "( [ fkfpi ] ) , one can obtain @xmath89 in terms of @xmath102 , thus expressing @xmath85 as @xmath103 .",
    "given a value of @xmath0 and sufficiently accurate experimental determinations of @xmath95 and of @xmath94 from the @xmath40 data ( see the discussion in ref.@xcite for the accuracy that is required ) , this would then allow to extract @xmath1 from the values of the @xmath22 branching ratios , and then to obtain @xmath89 from eq .",
    "( [ fkfpi ] ) .",
    "independent information on @xmath89 can of course modify the situation .",
    "for instance , there exists now a rather accurate determination of @xmath89 from partially quenched lattice data with staggered fermions@xcite .",
    "using this imput allows to extract @xmath1 directly from eq .",
    "( [ fkfpi])@xcite , given a value of @xmath0 .",
    "on the other hand , there exists also a direct , although quenched , lattice calculation@xcite of @xmath85 .",
    "these new developments offer possibilities for cross checks .",
    "in particular , one would like to have a determination of both @xmath89 and @xmath85 from the same lattice simulation with dynamical ( domain wall ? ) fermions , in order to check whether they satisfy the correlation implied by the above analysis of the two loop chpt expression .",
    "as far as the latter is concerned , the inclusion of isospin breaking corrections would be welcome .",
