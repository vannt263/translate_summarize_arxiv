    "the assumption of real susy parameters has partly been justified by the experimental limits on the electric dipole moments ( edm ) of the electron , neutron and mercury atom .",
    "however , the edm constraints can be avoided assuming masses of the first and second generation sfermions large ( above the tev scale ) , or arranging cancellations between the different susy contributions to the edms @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the complex phase of the higgsino mass parameter @xmath8 is much less restricted than previously assumed , whereas the complex phases of the soft  breaking trilinear scalar coupling parameters @xmath9 are practically unconstrained .",

    "the mass eigenstates are defined as @xmath25 in principle , the imaginary parts of the complex parameters involved could most directly and unambiguously be determined by measuring suitable @xmath18 violating observables . however , in the @xmath26-system this is not straightforward , because the @xmath27 are spinless and their main decay modes are two  body decays . on the other hand , also the @xmath18 conserving observables depend on the phases of the underlying complex parameters , because the mass eigenvalues and the couplings involved are functions of these parameters .",
    "the masses @xmath28 and mixing angle @xmath29 depend on the phases only through a term @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath28 are essentially independent of the phases because @xmath31 is small , whereas the phase dependence of @xmath29 is strongest if @xmath32 and @xmath33 . since the @xmath34 couplings are real , the @xmath35 production cross sections do not explicitly depend on the phases ( although @xmath36 coupling is complex , for @xmath37 production only @xmath38 exchange contributes )",
