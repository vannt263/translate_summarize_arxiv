    "monodisperse spherical particles with short range repulsions show a simple phase diagram , with only one fluid at low density and one crystal phase at high density , and a first order transition in between @xcite .",
    "the paradigmatic case is the system of hard spheres ( hs ) , where the interaction potential is infinite whenever particles overlap and zero elsewhere , and therefore there is no energy scale in it . in hs ,",
    "the crystallization transition was first recognized by alder and wainwright @xcite , and has the freezing and melting points at volume fractions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "additionally , a good approximation for the equation of state for hs fluid was given by carnahan and starling using the virial expansion @xcite , tested experimentally using sedimentation of screened charged colloids @xcite . for slightly soft spheres ( ss ) , where interpenetration is not yet an issue , the phase diagram changes quantitatively , shifting the fluid - solid coexistence , and introducing temperature as a new variable ( the energy scale , @xmath6 , is set by the potential , and @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the thermal energy , is coupled to the volume fraction ) .",
    "inverse - power potentials ( @xmath9 ) have been widely used to model ss , and the phase diagram studied as a function of the softness by simulations @xcite and theories @xcite . because of the qualitative similarity of the phase diagram of ss with that of hs , a mapping of the former to the latter has also been tried by means of effective diameters @xcite .",
    "however , an interesting pathology arises in hs which is absent in ss : the elastic modulus for large frequencies diverges in hs @xcite .",
    "experimentally , different colloidal systems have been used to model hs , such as silica @xcite or latex particles @xcite , or collapsed microgel @xcite or core - shell@xcite particles . because the hard sphere interaction is an idealization of quasi - rigid spheres , these systems are usually referred to as `` nearly hard spheres '' , and the question of their softness",
    "arises naturally @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "additionally , a ( generally thin ) polymer layer is adsorbed onto the particles to provide steric stability , what increases the softness of the particles @xcite .",
    "even more , experiments with really soft particles , such as swollen microgels @xcite or star polymers @xcite , can show new phases due to interpenetration , but also phase diagrams qualitatively similar to the hs one for the harder - particle limit .",
    "however , the short range interaction is not directly accessible experimentally @xcite , and exact knowledge of the true softness of the particle is missing .",
    "it is therefore important to know what properties depend on the softness of the particle , and if there is a simple scaling for different systems with different softness .",
    "recent simulations of inverse power potentials have shown that the transport coefficients depend strongly on the particle softness , and the hs limit is reached for large values of @xmath2 ( @xmath10 ) @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the time - correlation functions ( and transport coefficients ) can be approximately scaled using the exponent @xmath2 @xcite , but neither the scaling is perfect nor the exponent is known experimentally . on the other hand ,",
    "the transport coefficients behave quasi - linearly with the inverse packing fraction for different softness , what can indicate that the key parameter for mapping the systems is the free volume , but a detailed analysis of the parameters shows inconsistencies ( for instance , the free volume vanishes at different density for every transport coefficient ) @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to find a simple mapping from soft particles to hs , if it exists , that can be applied in experimental systems .    the freezing point , on the other hand , is well defined fundamentally , and can be identified with several well - known , albeit approximate , criteria @xcite , independently of the interaction potential , such as the hansen - verlet criterion , which uses the height of the neighbour peak in the structure factor @xcite , and a dynamical one , proposed by lwen and co - workers , based on the decrease of the long time diffusion coefficient @xcite . in computer simulations ,",
    "the freezing point can be determined accurately using gibbs - duhem integration from hs @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work , we propose to use the density at freezing to scale the results .",
    "using computer simulations , we show that the structural and dynamical quantities of interest of inverse - power potentials can be rationalized when plotted against the scaled density , @xmath11 , for large density at identical temperature .",
    "the long range structure is almost identical for systems with equal @xmath11 , but differences appear at short distances due to the different interaction potentials .",
    "the pressure , which shows a rather complicated trend when studied at constant density , increases monotonously with the softness at constant @xmath11 . the diffusion coefficient and viscosity",
    "can be collapsed for @xmath12 , including hs , and the time correlation functions only show differences at short times , giving different shear moduli at large frequencies .",
    "our conclusion is therefore that the relative density to the freezing transition is the key parameter governing the structure and dynamics of the system , for large enough @xmath2 and density .",
    "this poses a simple criterion that can be useful for experiments .",
    "we make simulations of different monodisperse systems : hard spheres and soft spheres with different `` softness '' . whereas the interaction potential is continuous for soft spheres , it is not for hard spheres , what makes an important difference in the computational method .",
    "the microscopic dynamics is newtonian , but we have also performed some brownian dynamics or damped newtonian dynamics to make more direct contact with experimental colloids .",
    "hard spheres only interact upon contact , when they collide elastically due to their excluded volume .",
    "given such a discontinuous potential we resort to an event - driven algorithm for the hard - sphere simulations .",
    "the method relies on the fact that in between collisions particles move undisturbed and in a straight line .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to only process the collisions when they occur .",
    "this is the basic feature of an event - driven algorithm : it does not evolve with a fixed time step , but instead time propagation is determined by the events in the simulation  the hard sphere collisions in the case of newtonian dynamics . in this paper",
    "we have modeled the interactions of the hard spheres by elastic collisions .",
    "the simulation consists of 1000 particles in a cube to which we apply standard periodic boundary conditions .",
    "simulations are started from a simple cubic lattice .",
    "velocities are then drawn at random from a gaussian distribution to let the system evolve towards equilibrium .",
    "from such an equilibrated configuration all further simulations are run .",
    "the standard deviation of the velocity determines the temperature of hard spheres : @xmath13 .",
    "inherently newtonian dynamics does not show any dependence on temperature .",
    "changing the temperature leads to a different timescale , but does not modify the dynamics qualitatively .",
    "it is therefor the density alone that determines the physical behaviour of the hard spheres .    in all our simulations",
    "the diameter @xmath14 determines the length scale and the particle mass @xmath15 the unit of mass , while @xmath16 may vary . with these conventions the time is given in units of @xmath17 wherever it appears .",
    "we have introduced brownian motion by incorporating a random thermostat .",
    "this feature introduces a new timescale @xmath18 on which the random kicks of the solvent are mimicked by drawing new velocities for each particle from a gaussian distribution@xcite .",
    "this timescale must be chosen such that it effectively generates diffusion between collisions .",
    "given densities up to the freezing point we find that @xmath19 is sufficiently small ( smaller values of @xmath18 cause too slow microscopic dynamics , increasing the simulation time @xcite )",
    ".      for soft spheres we use a continuous repulsive potential :    @xmath20    where @xmath6 sets the energy scale and @xmath21 is the _ softness _ of the potential . in this work ,",
    "we change @xmath2 from @xmath22 to @xmath23 , what provides a wide enough range to show clear effects from the softness of the potential , and the crossover to _ effective _ hard spheres .",
    "figure [ potential ] presents the interaction potentials for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the hard core repulsion .",
    "note that as @xmath2 decreases ( the softness increases ) , the potential has a longer range , and for @xmath22 , the interaction energy is negligible only for distances above @xmath28 .",
    "since the interaction potential is soft , the particle volume can not be unambiguously defined , and thus the volume fraction is not a convenient control parameter for these systems , although it is commonly used in experiments .",
    "instead , states in potentials with different softness can be compared using the _ effective density _ defined by the parameter @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number density . in this work",
    ", the temperature is fixed to @xmath31 , and variations in @xmath32 are caused by changes in the number density exclusively .",
    "conventional molecular dynamics are performed integrating the newton s equations of motion with velocity rescaling to maintain constant temperature .",
    "the time step for the integration is @xmath33 , in standard units of @xmath34 .",
    "all potentials have been truncated for @xmath35 .",
    "damped newtonian dynamics have been performed also , introducing friction and fluctuation ( brownian ) forces . for particle @xmath36 ,",
    "the equation of motion is now langevin equation :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the interaction force between particles @xmath39 and @xmath36 , @xmath40 is the friction coefficient with the solvent , and @xmath41 is the brownian force .",
    "the fluctuating and viscous terms are related by the fluctuation dissipation theorem : @xmath42 . in this work ,",

    "agrawal and kofke used gibbs - duhem integration to compute the solid - fluid phase boundary for ss modeled with inverse - power potentials , starting from the fcc - fluid coexistence in hs @xcite . their results for the freezing transition are presented in table i ( and in the inset to fig .",

    "these two quantities disagree , showing that a mapping based on the second virial coefficient would not find such a good scaling , concluding that soft spheres behave as hard ones only for very large values of @xmath2 .",

    "the pressure and the transport coefficients can be rescaled onto the hs values at high density when studied as a function of the density normalized to the freezing point for every system for @xmath3 , although they typically show non - monotonous behaviour for increasing density ( or volume fraction ) , irrespectively of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "concomintantly , distances must be measured in units of the interparticle distance , and all systems have the same long range structure at their freezing points .",
    "differences due to the different softness are appreciable only in the local environment of the particles , and at short times in the velocity and stress autocorrelation functions .",

    "as expected , differences in the correlation functions are also noticed depending on the microscopic dynamics used , although the final values of the transport coefficients can be scaled .",
    "these results show that the key parameter for dense systems of hard and soft spheres is not the density , but the relative distance to the freezing point ( which itself shows a non - monotonous behaviour with the softness of the potential ) .",
    "this can be of special interest for experimentalists , where a small softness can not be ruled out , in particular for particles covered with surfactant layers , or in cases where the determination of the colloid density poses a major problem .",
    "importantly , and perhaps at first counter intuitively , our simulations show that the mapping of a fluid of soft spheres onto the one of hard spheres becomes progressively better at higher densities and closer to freezing .",
    "this supports the idea , going back to van der waals , that the local packing of a dense fluid is dominated by the rapidly varying repulsion which can successfully be modeled by the hard sphere one @xcite . in these cases ,",
