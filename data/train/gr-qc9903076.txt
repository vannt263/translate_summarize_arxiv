    "the _ loop approach _ to quantum gravity @xcite has reached a mature status as a physical theory and it is one of the most likely candidate to be a complete consistent quantum theory of gravitational phenomena ( for a detailed review and update bibliography we refer to @xcite for quantum gravity in general and to @xcite for the loop approach in particular ) . in this approach it was possible : _",
    "i ) _ to construct the auxiliary hilbert space @xcite appropriate to the discussion of the kinematics _ ii ) _ to find an explicit basis ( the spin - networks basis ) on this hilbert space @xcite ; _ iii _ ) to rigorously solve the 3-diffeomorphism constraints @xcite ; _ iv ) _ to construct operators corresponding to volume and area and determine their spectrum @xcite . _ v _ ) to derive the beckenstein - hawking formula for the entropy of black holes @xcite    the elusive feature of the loop approach to quantum gravity is that in the _ frozen - time _ canonical picture the relation between operator and physical observable is cumbersome .",
    "a space time picture was lacking until m. reisenberger a c. rovelli @xcite derived a spin foam model ( using the terminology introduced by j. baez @xcite ) , to which they refer as _ world sheet model _",
    ", from the exponential of the super - hamiltonian constraint .",
    "they also show that this is formally related to the construction of the 4 dimensional path integral for gravity .",
    "this work was a first step in the direction of developing a sum over surfaces framework in `` loop quantum gravity '' whoose importance was first claimed by reisenberger in @xcite .",
    "this recent developments showed surprising formal analogy between loop quantum gravity and other approaches to the quantization of gravity .",
    "the model of dynamical triangulation @xcite and the ponzano - regge model @xcite are exactly models of this kind .",
    "the analogy is even deeper if one considers the ponzano - regge model [ the physicist version of the celebrated turaev - viro state sum model for 3-manifold invariant @xcite ) ] that can be formulated exactly as a sum over branched surfaces with colored graph observables ( spin networks ) on the boundary .    the previous consideration , together with the fact that the topological bf field theory in 4 dim @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) admits an analogous formulation as a spin foam model [ in this case , the spin foam dual to a simplicial decomposition ( triangulation ) ] , strongly suggest that quantum gravity should be naturally formulated using the language of spin foam models .",
    "now , two explicit proposals for the realization of this idea have been put forward .",
    "the first one",
    "( by barret and crane @xcite ) is related to the discretization of the path integral of the euclidean plebanski action @xcite ( see @xcite ) and the second ( by m. reisenberger @xcite ) of self dual euclidean gravity @xcite .",
    "the last model is the explicit quantization of the lattice model @xcite that has self dual euclidean gravity as its continuum limit .",
    "this research line is deeply connected to the idea of express classical gravity as a deformation ( by the imposition of additional lagrange constraints ) of a topological bf field theory 4 dimension .",
    "the idea is that @xcite topological bf theory , in the context of diff - invariant theory , can play a role analogue to the one of free theory in standard poincar invariant quantum fields theories .",
    "this idea is at the origin of the systematic proposal for deriving _",
    "spin foam weight factors _ from a classical action principle that has been recently proposed by freidel and krasnov @xcite .",
    "the discussion here it is in framework of piecewise linear topology and we refer the reader to @xcite for details . intuitively , this setting is equivalent to assume that cells , surfaces and edges that we use to decompose the manifold are finite unions of piecewise analytic sub - manifolds . in particular , a graph is a finite collection of analytic path .",
    "this framework as certain advantages and the resulting theory is simpler than the ones in the analytic or in the smooth setting .",
    "the utility of the pl setting in loop quantum gravity was first pointed out by zapata @xcite . all the topological objects ( graph , manifold , cellular decomposition , .... ) are assumed orientable . for the wigner nj - symbols we adopt the non normalized graphical convention of @xcite and we restrict to the case of the group @xmath11 and use penrose s binor formalism @xcite .",
    "most of the formulas remain valid in the quantum group case , but , in this case , factors related to the braiding can appear .",
    "loop quantum gravity is based on the hamiltonian formulation of classical general relativity in terms of the canonically conjugated variables @xmath12 ( densitized triad fields ) and @xmath13 ( ashtekar s connection ) @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is given , as it happens for any diff - invariant theory , only in terms of constraints . in our case : @xmath14    the loop program does the quantization of gravity in a straightforward way .",
    "it is based on the assumption that a particular class of classical functions ( the @xmath15 observables , i.e. , the _ traces _ of the _ holonomy _ of ashtekar s connection ) become well defined quantum operators .",
    "i.e. , it is assumed that , for any choice of the close loop @xmath16 , to the classical functional of the ashtekar connection : @xmath17 = { \\rm tr}\\left [ \\exp\\left (   \\int_\\gamma a_a(x ) dx^a\\right ) \\right]\\ ] ] corresponds a well defined quantum operator on a hilbert space @xmath18 .",
    "all the other properties should be essentialy derived from this assumption .",
    "a consequence of this choice is that the canonical variables @xmath12,@xmath13 do not become well defined operator on the hilbert space @xmath18 and the previous definition of the constraint ( unless properly regularized ) are meaningless on @xmath18 .",
    "this is one of the main technical reasons behind the difficulty of dealing with the super - hamiltonian constraint .",
    "given this assumption , there are two possible ways to define the theory . explicitly construct the vector space on which these operators are well defined ( loop representations , see @xcite ) , in a algebraic way , and then determine the correct scalar product . alternatively , construct a hilbert space @xmath18 ( the connection representation ) and show that , on this hilbert space , these operators are well defined @xcite .",
    "these two approaches are equivalent @xcite .",
    "however , two technical but important decision must be taken .",
    "the first one is connected to the properties of the loops @xmath16 .",
    "the request of piecewise analyticity brings to a different setting with respect to the smooth case since two piecewise analytic loop can have only a finite number of isolated intersection points .",
    "the second is that these constraction are well defined only in the case of a real connection .",
    "now , the standard ashtekar connection is naturaly real only in the case of euclidean gravity while in the case of lorentzian gravity is naturally complex and indeed what follows naturally applies only to euclidean gravity . however , it is important to note that , it is possible to use a real connection in the lorentzian case too ( the barbero connection @xcite ) at the prize of a more complicated form for the super - hamiltonian constraint .",
    "a full discussion of the kinematical setting is not important here .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the technical details and for complete references . for the following discusson it is sufficient to recall the basic structure of the hibert space @xmath18 .",
    "since a connection associates a group element @xmath19 to each edge ( segment embedded in @xmath20 ) of the graph @xmath16 .",
    "it is natural to consider for each graph @xmath16 the hilbert space ( @xmath21 $ ] ) of square integrable function , with respect to the unique normalized haar measure @xmath22 , on @xmath23 ( the number of edges @xmath24 in @xmath16 ) copies of the group [ @xmath25 @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath18 can be characterized as the projective limit of the previous family of hilbert spaces @xmath27 associated to all possible graphs @xmath16 embedded into @xmath20 .",
    "a rigorous definition of the diffeomorphism invariant hilbert space can be obtained @xcite using the gauge averaging procedure .",
    "the essential idea is that on @xmath39 there is a natural definition of the action of a diffeomorphism @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "in fact , in the spin - networks basis we can associated to each diffeomorphism @xmath42 the operator @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the imagine under @xmath42 of the spin network @xmath45 . at this point",
    "one can define the class of spin networks knots @xmath46 as the equivalence class of spin networks under diffeomorphism , i.e. @xmath47 it it exists a @xmath40 such that @xmath44 . in this way",
    ", we can define @xmath48 with the scalar product : @xmath49 \\langle s|\\hat{u}_\\phi s'\\rangle            = n \\int [ d\\phi ] \\langle \\phi(s)| s'\\rangle \\label{sp : diff}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is an arbitrary , not yet fixed , normalization factor and @xmath51 are two arbitrary spin networks in the @xmath46-knot class of @xmath46 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "the integration in eq .",
    "( [ sp : diff ] ) is meaningful because the scalar product of two spin networks of @xmath39 is different from zero only if they have support on the same graph .    in the previous derivation of the hilbert space @xmath53",
    "we made an implicit assumption on the kind of diffeomorphism that are allowed .",
    "having previously assumed that the loops are in the class of the piecewise analytics ones , it is natural to assume piecewise analytics diffeomorphism . in this case , the quotient space @xmath53 is a separable hilbert space .",
    "this leads directly to the pl framework .",
    "we refer to the work of zapata for the discussion of the subtleties involved @xcite .      in the first presentation of _ loop quantum gravity _",
    "@xcite was emphasized that loops without intersection , ( i.e. , spin network states whose graph @xmath16 with only bivalent vertices ) it is automatically in the kernel of the super - hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this gives the knowledge of an infinite dimensional subspace of the * physical * hilbert space @xmath54 .",
    "unfortunately , with the introduction of the volume operator @xcite , it was realized that all the spin network states based on graph @xmath16 with all vertices of valence less that @xmath55 are in the kernel of the volume operator .",
    "consequently , all the previously mentioned states , belonging to the kernel of the super - hamiltonian constraint , correspond to degenerate metrics and , therefore , can not correspond to genuine quantum 3 geometries .",
    "this urged the definition of the super - hamiltonian constraint @xmath56 on the whole diff - invariant hilbert space @xmath53 .",
    "the situation improved in 1996 when thiemann @xcite was able to construct an operator with the _ naiv _ classical limit . using this definition , it is possibile investigate the true * physical * hilbert space @xmath54 . for the purpose of the present discussion",
    "we do not need a complete account of its definition and its properties . what it is interesting for us it is that : 1 ) it is possible to define such operator ; 2 ) a rough idea of its action @xmath53 .",
    "its main property is that it acts locally around each vertex of the spin network .",
    "it adds or deletes an edge of color 1 @xmath57 \\left|     \\begin{array}{c}\\setlength{\\unitlength}{.8 pt }    \\begin{picture}(65,50 )       \\put ( 0 , 0){\\line ( 1 ,   1){20 } }        \\put ( 0,20){\\line ( 1 ,   0){20 } }        \\put ( 0,40){\\line ( 1 , -1){20 } }       \\put(20,20){\\circle*{3 } }       \\put(20,20){\\line ( 3 ,   2){30 } } \\put(52,38){$\\scriptstyle k$ }        \\put(20,20){\\line ( 3 , -2){30 } } \\put(52 , 2){$\\scriptstyle j$ }        \\put(45 , 8){$\\scriptstyle p$ }   \\put(45,30){$\\scriptstyle q$ }     \\end{picture}\\end{array }      \\right\\rangle\\ ] ] with well definite weight factors [ ( @xmath58 ) matrix elements of the operator ] that can be explicitly computed @xcite .",
    "summarizing , the mathematical definition of the loop quantization of gravity , and the determination of the * physical * hilbert space @xmath54 , involves the analysis of the following hierarchy of hilbert spaces : @xmath59 where an arrow means imposition of a constraint and the questions mark emphasis the fact that , the last step , it is still not completely understood .",
    "in fact : 1 ) the physical correctness of the thiemann s proposal for the regularization of the super - hamiltonian constraint has been questioned ; 2 ) more of one variant of this operator can be construct and indeed the problem of determine the correct one ; 3 ) despite @xcite there is not a clear understanding of the kernel of the super - hamiltonian constraint nor of the class of operator that are well defined on this hilbert space .",
    "in the previous equation , @xmath18 is a diff - invariant definition of the hamiltonian constraints and @xmath75 is a 2-dimensional branched surface embedded over @xmath76 $ ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : spine ] we reported an example of branched surface , and of the corresponding spin - network transition .",
    "the kind of surfaces that appear on the sum is explicitly determined by the kind of non null matrix elements of the super - hamiltonian constraints .",
    "we want to emphasize , once more , that this derivation is based on formal argument .",
    "the use of formal argument is of great help to understand the general picture behind but one should stop here .",
    "the result of this formal derivation is that the functional integral associate to quantum gravity is defined ( or , better , should be ) as a sum over branched surface interpolating between two spin networks .",
    "moreover , it shows that one has to consider the sum over all the possible ( not just one ) such branched surfaces .",
    "this in a deep breakthrough toward the understanding of loop quantum gravity and it shows a strict relationship between loop quantum gravity and topological field theories of bf type opening the possibility of use technics developed for such theories .    the first occurrence , ( to our knowledge ) of the idea of formulating the transition amplitude between two hilbert space ( spanned by embedded colored graph ) associated to two boundary component of a manifolds , as a weight associated to the colored branched surface interpolending between the two graphs , first appeared in turaev and viro @xcite .",
    "these authors used the terms : two dimensional polyhedral quantum field theory ( _ spin foam _ models are model of this kind ) .",
    "the next section will be dedicated to the exposition of this idea in the case of 2 + 1 dimensional gravity or , more precisely , of the ponzano - regge - turaev - viro model .",
    "the receipt for the construction of this model ( to which we will refer to as the prtv - model ) is the following .",
    "color all the edge ( 1-dimensional object of the triangulation ) with irreducible representations of the @xmath11 group and assign the following factor to the various object of the triangulation : 1 ) to each edge the dimension of the representation @xmath81 ; 2 ) to each triangle the inverse of the 3j symbol made out by the three colors associated to each of its edges @xmath82 ; 3 ) to each tetrahedron the associated 6j symbol ( a tetrahedron has 6 edges ) @xmath83 $ ] .       in the case of the prtv - model , it is useful to consider its dual formulation , i.e. to take advantage of the duality between triangulation and standard polyhedron suggested by figure [ duality ] . in the dual cellular complex @xmath84 of the triangulation @xmath77",
    "we have that to each @xmath23-dimensional cell of @xmath77 is uniquely assigned a 3-@xmath23-dimensional cell of @xmath84 . in three dimension , the objects dual to an edge ( 1 dimensional object ) is a surface ( 2=3 - 1 dimensional object ) .",
    "this implies that to each coloration of the edges of the triangulation @xmath77 is associated a unique coloration of the face ( two dimensional objects ) of its dual standard polyhedron @xmath84 . in turns , it is possible to consider the prtv - model as a model defined over a two dimensional branched surface .",
    "i.e. , using this duality , we can interpret the prtv model both as a state sum model associated to a triangulation but also has a state sum model associated to a branched surface : @xmath85 = tv_g[{\\cal s}_2^{\\delta^ * } ] \\label{shadowsum}\\ ] ] where by @xmath86 we denote the collection of all the faces , edges and vertices ( the 2-scheleton ) of the cellular decomposition of @xmath78 dual to triangulation @xmath77 .",

    "all the edges and faces of a standard 2-polyhedron dual to a triangulation of @xmath20 have euler - characteristic equal to 1 !",
    "we explicitly wrote the euler characteristic because one of the interesting characteristic of the prtv partition function is that is is defined for any stratification of the manifolds @xmath78 whose two skeleton is a standard polyhedron .",
