    "yang - mills gauge theories have provided the building principle for all the known interactions of nature .",
    "they enable the unified description of the weak and electro - magnetic interactions as well as the strong interactions , guaranteeing the renormalizability of the theory .",
    "gravity is a gauge theory of a different kind .",
    "this difference is precisely the main reason of why we do not have a theory of quantum gravity : in yang - mills gauge theories , the gauge symmetry at our disposal enable the formulation of unitary and renormalizable models . the gauge symmetry of general relativity , on the other hand , is not enough to have renormalizability .",
    "the most promising road to quantize gravity is provided by string theory @xcite .",
    "this is so because in string theories the amount of gauge symmetries increases enormously .",
    "so much that the model is not only renormalizable , but finite .",
    "one of the motivations of this paper is to explore new kinds of gauge symmetries based in the algebraic structure built in the batalin - vilkovisky(bv ) quantization method .",
    "a preliminary report on these ideas is contained in @xcite .",
    "some of the theories based on these symmetries share the property of being one - loop theories ( semiclassical ) , in the sense that higher loop corrections are absent .",
    "so the one - loop effective action is the exact effective action for these models.as such it could provide a playground to study non - perturbative effects in yang - mills theories .",
    "another arena where we could apply this program is quantum gravity . thooft and veltman @xcite showed that the one loop effective action of general relativity ( pure gravity ) is renormalizable on shell . in the semiclassical version of general relativity",
    "this will be the exact result , so physical observables such as the black hole entropy should be computable for these models .",
    "the computation is too involved in quantum gravity , so we prefer to test our ideas in the simpler case of non - abelian yang - mills theories .    in this paper",
    ", we study the properties of a non - abelian gauge theory in which the expression @xmath0 appears in its generating functional .",
    "this constraint is generated , not imposed by hand @xcite . to implement it",
    ", we will construct a quantum field model , invariant under a set of local gauge transformations obtained from ( bv ) formalism @xcite , then we will show that the non - abelian gauge theory with constraint is obtained from this model when we study its generating functional .",
    "we are going to show that it is a one - loop theory .",
    "it follows that computations as the @xmath1 function and the effective action will be exact .",
    "some relevant questions shall be answered : is it necessary to renormalize the model ?",
    ", is the theory asymptotically free ?",
    "it will turn out that indeed the theory is renormalizable and asymptotically free if the gauge group is non - abelian .",
    "the bad news is the presence of negative norm states in the spectrum ( see appendix b ) , so the model is not manifestly unitary .",
    "it may happens that there could exist a projection on the hilbert space such that in the projected subspace the theory is unitary . in the worst situation",
    ", we could consider it as a useful effective theory .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of what happens in yang - mills theories on nonsemisimple groups @xcite .",
    "these theories have similar properties as ours .",
    "notice , however , that our semiclassical models are more general than yang - mills theories on nonsemisimple groups(see equation ( [ z2 ] ) ) .",
    "in particular our models do nt need a gauge symmetry to start with .",
    "( see the appendix a ) .",
    "the paper is written as follows : in section 2 we introduce the fields , the gauge transformations and find the invariant lagrangian that produce the classical equations of motion as constraints . in section 3 ,",
    "we quantize the model using the brst formalism @xcite and the background field method @xcite . in section 4",
    ", we present the main result of the paper : the @xmath1 function , and prove that the theory lives at one loop . in section 5",
    "we analyze the conclusions .",
    "we work with a compact semisimple lie group , with generators @xmath2 and structure constants @xmath3 .",
    "the fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 have an index @xmath6 in the algebra running from @xmath7 to algebra dimension @xmath8 .",
    "the index @xmath9 goes from @xmath10 .",
    "the space - time metric is @xmath11 .",
    "we are going to work in the adjoint representation of the group , then fields and infinitesimal parameters will be defined as follows @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "let s continue defining the following transformations obtained from @xcite .",
    "these transformations depend on two parameters and form a closed algebra .",
    "they split into two classes , homogeneous and inhomogeneous transformations .",
    "the homogeneous transformations are :    @xmath18\\ , , \\ ] ]    @xmath19 + [ \\epsilon_{1},a].\\ ] ]    they act over pairs of fields ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , which can be thought as components of one field @xmath22 , where its first and second component transforms according to ( [ t1 ] ) and ( [ t2])respectively .    the inhomogeneous transformations are :    @xmath23 \\ , , \\ ] ]    @xmath24 +            \\partial_{\\mu } \\varepsilon_{1 } + [ \\varepsilon_{1},a_{\\mu}].\\ ] ]    they act over pairs of fields ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) , which can be thought as one field @xmath27 .",
    "we can see that under a transformation with @xmath28 parameter fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 transform as scalars in the adjoint representation of the group , and @xmath25 transforms as a usual gauge field . under @xmath29 transformation @xmath20 and @xmath25 do nt transform while @xmath21 and @xmath26 transform mixing with their partners .",
    "the covariant derivatives act over @xmath22-type fields and are defined as a function of the transformation as follows :    @xmath30\\ , , \\ ] ]    @xmath31 -                                 \\left [ b_{\\mu } , a \\right],\\ ] ]    and transform homogeneously as components of a @xmath22-type field .",
    "the field strength is obtained , as usual , commuting two covariant derivatives .",

    "if we work with compact semisimple lie groups @xcite , we can normalize @xmath34 as follows:@xmath35 .",
    "since the field strength transform homogeneously we have the following gauge invariant lagrangian :    @xmath36    with    @xmath37    the first term in ( [ l3 ] ) is a usual gauge invariant lagrangian density while the second term is a new expression linear in the field @xmath26 .",
    "the constant @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be absorbed by the tensors @xmath40 and @xmath41 if we do a change of scale ; @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we can note that the theory has only one coupling constant @xmath38 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that @xmath25 satisfies the classical yang - mills equations of motion and transform as a usual gauge field whereas @xmath26 will generate a constraint in the path integral .",

    "taking advantage of this situation we will study the gauge theory with the constraint studying this new model ( [ l3 ] ) by placing @xmath25 and @xmath26 on the same level , forgetting for a moment that @xmath25 satisfies the classical equation of motion and that @xmath26 is an auxiliary field .",
    "the kind of diagrams that we can construct will show us that @xmath26 is an auxiliary field and that this model corresponds to a theory of the same kind as ( [ delta ] ) .    from the expression ( [ delta ] )",
