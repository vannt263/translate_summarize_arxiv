    "the ground state remains four - fold degenerate in the @xmath116 limit even down to @xmath177 .",

    "we introduce reduced density matrices for both of the augmented blocks , each of hilbert space size @xmath183 , by computing partial traces over states on the right ( or left ) halves of the chain . the reduced density matrix for the left half of the chain",

    "@xmath185 are the matrix elements of the many - body wavefunction projected onto a basis of states labeled by unprimed roman index @xmath186 which covers the left half of the chain and primed index @xmath187 which covers the right half .",
    "the states are normalized in eq .  [ density ] to insure that @xmath188 . as can be verified numerically , all of the eigenvalues of @xmath189 are real ( as it is a symmetric matrix ) and , more significantly , they are positive and hence may be interpreted as probabilities .",
    "the dmrg truncation procedure thus corresponds to the elimination of the least - important sectors of the hilbert space .",
    "our choice for the reduced density matrix agrees with that of bursill , xiang , and gehring@xcite but differs from that of nishino@xcite who argues that a product of left with right eigenstates is optimal in a variational sense .",
    "however , the resulting reduced density matrix is non - hermitian and some of its eigenvalues are negative ; they can not be interpreted as probabilities .",
    "further , it is a difficult numerical problem to find a large fraction of the eigenstates of a non - hermitian matrix . since the reduced density matrix is introduced solely for the purpose of truncating , in a systematic manner , the rapid growth of the hilbert space with chain length , here we adopt the symmetric choice ( eq .  [ density ] ) and check that observables do not change significantly when the size @xmath190 of the block s hilbert space is enlarged .",
    "the exactly solvable @xmath125 limit permits another important check on the quality of the dmrg algorithm .",
    "we have verified that the dmrg procedure accurately reproduces the energies of the four degenerate ground states obtained from the dispersion relation ( eq .  [ dispersion ] ) as the chain grows .",

    "the rest of the dmrg algorithm is standard : during each iteration , the chain is cut into left and right pieces , the reduced density matrix for each half is formed and diagonalized , new representations of the operators are found , and finally two sites are added to the middle of the chain and the resulting new hamiltonian is diagonalized via the modified davidson - liu algorithm .",
    "the near degeneracy and defectiveness of @xmath83 slows down the diagonalization considerably and can be partly compensated by increasing the size of the davidson subspace .",
    "we run the double - precision , vectorized , multi - processor c - code on a cray el-98 computer .",
    "the largest computations take about 1 gbyte of memory and require several weeks to run .",
    "previous work on the replica limit of the heisenberg@xcite and hubbard@xcite models focused on the scaling of the spin gap @xmath197 as a function of @xmath36 , the staggered coupling between neighboring sites .",
    "it is difficult to gain direct access to the spin gap in the supersymmetric chain due to the plethora of low - lying excitations in the pure spin - up sector ( discussed in sec .",

    "critical behavior is evident , however , in the expectation value of a spin - flip operator which lives on the bonds between neighboring sites .",
    "it is important to note though that according to eq .",
    "[ expect ] supersymmetry - invariant operators ( those which commute with the supersymmetric charges @xmath198 ) , have zero expectation value .",
    "for example , @xmath199 despite the fact that the ground state energy is negative .",
    "the non - supersymmetric fermion spin - flip operator @xmath200 , on the other hand , is an appropriate choice .",
    "even with no applied dimerization ( @xmath27 ) , its ground - state expectation value @xmath201 has even / odd modulation due to the free boundary condition at the chain ends .",

    "the chain ends induce slight dimerization ( which also breaks reflection symmetry about site centers ) .",
    "each time the chain length is increased by two sites during a dmrg iteration the pattern of weak and strong bonds alternates ; the term @xmath203 appearing in eq .",
    "[ delta ] accounts for this alternation .    as @xmath204 is the expectation value of an operator which induces dimerization at @xmath139 it has scaling dimension @xmath205 which is related to the correlation length exponent by the standard scaling relation : @xmath206@xcite",
    "therefore , in a finite system we expect @xmath207 this observation provides us with a means of extracting @xmath208 from the dmrg by measuring the expectation value of the dimerization operator on the central bonds , @xmath209 , at each dmrg step .    to test this method , and the dmrg algorithm , we first examine the ordinary isotropic , nearest - neighbor , spin-@xmath210 su(2 ) quantum antiferromagnet . in this case",

    "the discrepancy with the exact result we attribute to the presence of a marginally irrelevant operator@xcite , and other less relevant scaling operators .",
    "these corrections to scaling , which lead to a slightly larger value of the effective exponent , are evidenced by a slight curvature of the plot in fig .",
    "[ bondfluct2 ] .",
    "more precisely , the marginally irrelevant operator makes multiplicative logarithmic corrections to scaling@xcite .",

    "we account for these less relevant operators by fitting @xmath209 to the functional form @xmath224 . as in the case of the @xmath95 heisenberg chain",
    "above , we taylor - expand @xmath225 , keeping only the first two terms . following this procedure",
    "we obtain @xmath226 .",
    "the error is estimated by choosing different sets of points to include in the fit ; statistical errors are smaller , at the few percent level .",
    "this value of the scaling dimension is consistent with the more precise value @xmath227 ( using @xmath228 ) , reported by other groups@xcite .",
    "the dmrg works best for phases with a gap to low - lying excitations ; we do not expect , nor do we find , very good quantitative agreement at the critical point . to obtain more accurate scaling",
    "it would be necessary to employ the `` finite - size '' dmrg algorithm and carry out careful finite - size analysis by varying both the chain length @xmath229 and the dimerization parameter @xmath36 to search for a universal scaling function .",

    "are fully polarized in the @xmath67-direction and no extended edge currents flow ; in the opposite @xmath232 limit the two spins are free and the conductivity increases by a quantum@xcite .",
    "second , and more importantly , the hamiltonian is analytically tractable when projected onto the hilbert space with only one type ( @xmath67 ) of boson and fermion .",

    "the significance of the defectiveness of the hamiltonian is unclear .",
    "it is a robust feature , as it occurs at both infinite and finite @xmath98 . also unanswered",
