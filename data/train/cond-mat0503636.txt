    "the superconductor coupled mesoscopic hybrid systems have attracted much attention in recent years , not only because of fundamental interest , but also of potential applications for future nanoelectronics.@xcite in ballistic superconductor / normal - metal / superconductor ( s",
    "/ n / s ) junction , andreev bound states can be formed.@xcite each andreev bound state carries a supercurrent in positive or negative direction at a given phase difference @xmath1 between the two superconductors . therefore , the net supercurrent between two superconductors depends not only on the phase difference @xmath1 , but also on the occupation of the andreev bound states .",
    "when two superconductors are weakly linked , the current - phase relation is @xmath2 . on some occasions",
    ", the sign of @xmath3 may be reversed,@xcite which is referred to as the @xmath0-junction transition , because the minus sign can be absorbed in to the phase factor as @xmath4 .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction plays an important role in the quantum dot ( qd ) , because it can change the spin orientation of an electron .",
    "the spin - flip mechanisms in the gaas - based qd have been studied.@xcite the spin - flip effects on trasport properties of a quantum dot in the normal - metal and superconductor hybrid system has been studied.@xcite various resonant peaks appear for the different spin - flip strengths in the qd.@xcite the spin - dependent andreev reflection tunneling through a qd with the spin - flip scattering has also been studied.@xcite it is found that competition between the intradot spin - flip scattering and the tunneling coupling to the leads dominates the resonant behaviors of the andreev reflection.@xcite    it is natural to ask if the intradot spin - flip scattering could induce some novel phenomena in the supercurrent such as the @xmath0-junction transition . motivated by this , we investigate the spin - flip scattering effects on the supercurrent and andreev bound states in the superconductor / quantum - dot / superconductor ( s / qd / s ) system in this paper . by using the standard nonequilibrium green s function ( ngf ) techniques,@xcite we have analyzed quantum transport properties of the s / qd / s system . the configuration of the andreev bound states depend heavily on the spin - flip strength .",
    "since the supercurrent is carried by these states , the spin - flip scattering has a great influence on the amplitude and sign of the supercurrents .",
    "the dependence of the supercurrent and andreev bound states on the gate voltage is also studied .",
    "the s / qd / s system under consideration is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath5 with @xmath6,\\ ] ] @xmath7 @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the standard bcs hamiltonian for the left / right superconducting leads with phase @xmath11 and the energy gap @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 models the quantum dot with a single spin - degenerate level @xmath14 , which can be controlled by the gate voltage .",
    "the spin - flip term in the @xmath13 comes from the spin - orbit interaction in the quantum dot .",
    "@xmath15 denotes the tunneling part of the hamiltonian , and @xmath16 are the hopping matrix .",
    "the supercurrent can be calculated from standard ngf techniques .",
    "the @xmath17 nambu representation is used to include the physics of ar and the spin - flip process in a unified formalism .",
    "the retarded green s function if defined as @xmath18 with the operator @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the fourier - transformed retarded green s function of the qd without and with the coupling to the leads . in the nambu representation , they can be written as @xmath22 the retarded self - energy under the wide - bandwidth approximation can be derived as@xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the appropriate linewidth functions describing the coupling between the dot and the respective superconducting leads . under the wide - bandwidth approximation ,",
    "the linewidth functions are independent on the energy variable .",
    "furthermore , we set @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 with small values for the symmetric and weak - coupling case .",
    "the factor @xmath28 is defined as @xmath29 by using the dyson equation , the retarded green function of the system can be obtained as @xmath30^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 .",

    "the josephson current can be divided into two parts , contributed by the continuous spectrum for @xmath42 and discrete spectrum for @xmath43 : @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 the averaged ldos is given by @xmath47\\},\\ ] ] we perform the calculations at zero temperature in units of @xmath48 .",
    "the energy gap of the superconductor is fixed as @xmath49 .",
    "all the energy quantities in the calculations are scaled by @xmath12 .",
    "the linewidth is @xmath50 for the symmetric and weak - coupling case .",
    "in the following , the numerical results of the supercurrents and the andreev quasibound states are discussed in detail .",
    "the supercurrent originates from andreev reflection at the interface between the superconducting leads and the central region .",
    "1(a ) and ( b ) present the supercurrent @xmath51 ( includes both @xmath3 and @xmath52 ) versus the phase difference @xmath1 with different spin - flip scattering strength @xmath53 .",
    "first , we investigate the case without the spin - flip scattering @xmath54 .",
    "the current @xmath52 from the discrete spectrum vs @xmath1 is similar to a @xmath55-like curve .",
    "however , the current @xmath3 from the continuous spectrum vs @xmath1 is similar to a @xmath4-like curve , because the current @xmath3 is a @xmath0-junction josephson relation@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the current @xmath52 is much larger than the current @xmath3 , which means that the total supercurrent @xmath51 is mainly contributed by @xmath52 and also shows a sine - like dependence on the phase @xmath1 .",
    "now , we investigate the case with the spin - flip scattering @xmath56 .",
    "it is interesting to point out that @xmath51 vs @xmath1 is not a @xmath55-like but a @xmath4-like curve .",
    "there is a @xmath0-junction transition for the supercurrent - phase relation .",
    "the reason is related to the spin - flip scattering which greatly suppresses the current @xmath52 .",
    "thus the total supercurrent is mainly contributed by @xmath3 but not by @xmath52 as that without the spin - flip scattering . due to the quite different dependence of @xmath52 and @xmath52 on @xmath1 , the supercurrent @xmath51 shows a @xmath0-junction transition under the influence of the spin - flip scattering effects .    to fully understand the @xmath0-junction transition",
    ", we plot the @xmath40 for the cases with and without the spin - flip scattering in fig .",
    "1(c ) and ( d ) . for the case with @xmath54 , the original level @xmath57 is split into two andreev quasibound states",
    "when the energy @xmath58 of an incoming electron lines up with the andreev bound states , a resonance occurs , leading to a very large supercurrent . as seen from fig .",
    "1(c ) , @xmath40 has two @xmath59-function - type discrete spectra within the superconducting gap , corresponding to the two andreev bound states .",
    "they carry supercurrents with opposite signs : positive for @xmath60 and negative for @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath40 also has a continuous spectrum outside the superconducting gap : negative for @xmath62 and positive for @xmath63 . at zero temperature",
    ", only the spectrum of @xmath64 relates to the current .",
    "since the contribution from the discrete spectrum @xmath60 is much larger than that from the continuous one @xmath62 , the current @xmath51 is mostly contributed by @xmath52 . for the case with @xmath56 ,",
    "the original level @xmath57 is spit into two ones as @xmath65 and @xmath66 due to the spin - flip perturbation , which results in four andreev bound states .",
    "the original andreev bound state @xmath60 is split into two ones as @xmath60 and @xmath67 , and similarly @xmath61 is split into @xmath61 and @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath40 has four @xmath59-function - type discrete spectra within the superconducting gap .",
    "the andreev bound states depend strongly on the configuration of the qd levels ( @xmath65,@xmath66 ) , but weakly on the phase difference @xmath1 , and the electron levels @xmath65 and @xmath66 are coupled by andreev reflection tunneling .",
    "therefore , andreev bound states can be viewed as hybrids of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "with increasing @xmath53 , @xmath60 and @xmath68 move in the same direction , and both of them are below the fermi level at strong enough @xmath53 . as a consequence ,",
    "they make little net contribution to the supercurrent , and the relatively small negative continuous spectrum of @xmath62 dominates .",
    "the contribution from the discrete spectrum is suppressed by the spin - flip scattering .",
    "this is the origin of the @xmath0-junction transition in the supercurrent under the influence of the spin - flip scattering in the qd .",
    "another important quantity , the local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath69 , is also shown in fig .",
    "1(e ) and ( f )",
    ". a series of very narrow peaks emerge in @xmath69 , clearly indicating the formation of andreev quasibound states inside the qd .",
    "the peaks of the current density @xmath40 are located precisely at the energies of andreev bound states , which is a clear indication that the current is carried by these states .",
    "the results above are obtained by fixing the intradot level @xmath14 to zero , which is just at the center of the gap and at the fermi level of both left and right leads .",
    "next , we investigate how the supercurrent is affected when @xmath14 is moved away from zero by the gate voltage .",
    "the supercurrent at different @xmath14 are plotted in fig .",
    "2 . as seen from fig .",
    "2(a ) , the supercurrent at @xmath70 has similar @xmath4-like phase dependence with that in fig .",
    "however , when @xmath71 , there appears a @xmath0-junction transition , and then the supercurrent has has similar @xmath55-like phase dependence with that in fig .",
    "to explain this transition , the corresponding current density @xmath40 are also shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) and ( d ) .",
    "with @xmath72 , the andreev quasibound states in @xmath40 are shifted in their positions .",
    "the two successive states are shifted in opposite directions .",
    "the two bound states @xmath60 and @xmath67 carrying the positive current move to @xmath73 , while @xmath61 and @xmath68 carrying the negative current move to @xmath12 . at small @xmath14 ,",
    "the net current from discrete spectrum @xmath60 and @xmath68 are very small and the continuous spectrum @xmath62 mainly contributes the current . at large enough @xmath14 , the position of @xmath67 and @xmath68 can even move past over the fermi level , and both of their positions are below the fermi level .",
    "now , the current are mainly contributed by the discrete spectrum of @xmath60 and @xmath67 , but not by @xmath62 anymore .",
    "this is just the reason why the @xmath0-junction transition occurs .",
    "the corresponding @xmath69 shown in fig .",
    "2(e ) and ( f ) are symmetric about the fermi level .",
    "the narrow peaks with different height clearly indicate shift of the andreev bound states .    to clearly show the @xmath0-junction transitions mentioned above",
    ", the dependence of @xmath74 on @xmath53 and @xmath14 are plotted in fig .",
    "3 . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , @xmath75 decreases slowly first with increasing @xmath53 .",
    "when the spin - flip scattering strength @xmath53 is comparable and close to @xmath14 , @xmath75 decreases rapidly and can even change the sign from positive to negative .",
    "then the @xmath76-phase transition occurs as shown in fig .",
    "1 . at larger @xmath14",
    ", the stronger @xmath53 is needed to move the bound state @xmath68 to below the fermi level as @xmath60 .",
    "the negative current carried by @xmath68 counteracts with the positive current carried by @xmath60 .",
    "then the @xmath0-junction transition can occur . when there is no spin - flip scattering @xmath54 , increasing @xmath14 can decrease @xmath75 as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) . because the intradot energy level @xmath65 and @xmath66 are not symmetric about the fermi level at nonzero @xmath14 , the andreev reflection are suppressed and then the current decreases . for the nonzero @xmath53 , @xmath75 first increases and then decreases . at small spin - flip strength @xmath53 , increasing @xmath14 does not change of the sign of @xmath75 . at some strong enough @xmath53 , which already induces the @xmath0-junction transition",
    ", @xmath75 can change the sign form negative to positive with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "then another @xmath76-phase transition occurs as shown in fig .",
    "2 . when @xmath14 is comparable and close to @xmath53 , a maximum of @xmath75 appears .",
    "the reason is related to the position shift of the andreev bound states with @xmath14 as mentioned above .",
    "with increasing @xmath14 , @xmath60 and @xmath67 move to below the fermi level while @xmath61 and @xmath68 move to above the fermi level .",
    "the components contributed to the supercurrent change from ( @xmath60 , @xmath68 , @xmath62 ) to ( @xmath60 , @xmath67 , @xmath62 ) , and then the current first increases . with further increasing @xmath14 ,",
    "the current density is suppressed greatly due to the asymmetry of the intradot levels , and then the current decrease again .",
    "in summary , by using the nonequilibrium green s function method , the spin - flip scattering effects on the supercurrent and andreev bound states are studied in detail . the supercurrent is mostly contributed by the discrete andreev bound states if there is no spin - flip scattering .",
    "the original andreev bound state is split into two ones due to the spin - flip scattering , and the successive two bound states carrying currents with opposite signs move to the same direction with increasing spin - flip scattering strength . the main contributions to supercurrents can be changed from the discrete spectrum to the continuous spectrum at proper spin - flip scattering strength , which results in the @xmath0-junction transition .",
    "furthermore , another @xmath0-junction transition can appear if the intradot energy level is controlled to some proper value by the gate voltage , because the successive two bound states carrying currents with the same signs move to the same direction .",
    "the main contributions to supercurrents are from the discrete spectrum again , which results in this transition .",
    "although the strength of the spin - flip scattering and the position of the intradot energy level have quite different influence on the supercurrents , the two @xmath0-junction transition mechanisms are involved in the change of the current density .",
