    "the technique of simulated annealing ( sa ) was first proposed by kirkpatrick _",
    "@xcite as a general method to solve optimization problems .",
    "the idea is to use thermal fluctuations to allow the system to escape from local minima of the cost function so that the system reaches the global minimum under an appropriate annealing schedule ( the rate of decrease of temperature ) . if the temperature is decreased too quickly , the system may become trapped in a local minimum .",
    "too slow annealing , on the other hand , is practically useless although such a process would certainly bring the system to the global minimum .",
    "geman and geman proved a theorem on the annealing schedule for a generic problem of combinatorial optimization @xcite .",
    "they showed that any system reaches the global minimum of the cost function asymptotically if the temperature is decreased as @xmath0 or slower , where @xmath1 is a constant determined by the system size and other structures of the cost function .",
    "this bound on the annealing schedule may be the optimal one under generic conditions although faster decrease of the temperature often gives satisfactory results in practical applications for many systems .",
    "thermal fluctuations were introduced in the optimization problem so that transitions between states take place in the process of search for the global minimum among many states . thus there seems to be no reasons to avoid use of other mechanisms for state transitions if these mechanisms may lead to better convergence properties .",
    "one such possibility is the generalized transition probability of tsallis @xcite , which is a generalization of the conventional boltzmann - type transition probability appearing in the master equation and thus used in monte carlo simulations ( see also @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we seek another possibility of making use of quantum tunneling processes for state transitions , which we call quantum annealing ( qa ) .",
    "in particular we would like to learn how effectively quantum tunneling processes possibly lead to the global minimum in comparison to temperature - driven processes used in the conventional method of sa .    in the virtual absence of previous studies along such a line of consideration , it seems better to focus our attention on a specific model system , rather than to develop a general argument , to gain an insight into the role of quantum fluctuations in the situation of optimization problem .",
    "quantum effects have been found to play a very similar role to thermal fluctuations in the hopfield model in a transverse field in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "this observation motivates us to investigate dynamical properties of the ising model under quantum fluctuations in the form of a transverse field .",
    "we therefore discuss in this paper the transverse ising model with a variety of exchange interactions .",
    "the transverse field controls the rate of transition between states and thus plays the same role as the temperature does in sa .",
    "we assume that the system has no thermal fluctuations in the qa context and the term `` ground state '' refers to the lowest - energy state of the hamiltonian without the transverse field term .",
    "static properties of the transverse ising model have been investigated quite extensively for many years @xcite .",
    "there have however been very few studies on the dynamical behavior of the ising model with a transverse field .",
    "we refer to the work by sato _",
    "et al . _ who carried out quantum monte carlo simulations of the two dimensional gaussian spin glass model in an infinitesimal transverse field , showing a reasonably fast approach to the ground state @xcite .",
    "we present here a new point of view by comparing the efficiency of qa directly with that of classical sa in reaching the ground state .",
    "we solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation and the classical master equation numerically for small - size systems with the same exchange interactions under the same annealing schedules .",
    "calculations of probabilities that the system is in the ground state at each time for both classical and quantum cases give important implications on the relative efficiency of the two approaches .",
    "in the next section we explain the model and define the measure of closeness of the system in qa to the desired ground state .",
    "this measure is compared with the corresponding classical probability that the system is in the ground state , the definition of which is also given there . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] numerical results for qa and sa are shown for various types of annealing schedules and interactions .",
    "the data suggest that qa generally gives a larger probability to lead to the ground state than sa under the same conditions on the annealing schedule and interactions .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] deals with the analytical solutions for the one - spin case which turns out to be quite non - trivial .",
    "explicit solutions yield very useful information to clarify several subtle aspects of the problem .",
    "the final section is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "let us consider the following ising model with longitudinal and transverse fields : @xmath2 where the type of interactions will be specified later .",
    "the term of longitudinal field was introduced to remove the trivial degeneracy in the exchange interaction term coming from the overall up - down symmetry that effectively reduces the available phase space by half .",
    "the @xmath3-term causes quantum tunneling between various classical states ( the eigenstates of the classical part @xmath4 ) . by decreasing the amplitude @xmath5 of the transverse field from a very large value to zero",
    ", we hopefully drive the system into the optimal state , the ground state of @xmath4 .",
    "the natural dynamics of the present system is provided by the schrdinger equation @xmath6 we solve this time - dependent schrdinger equation numerically for small - size systems .",
    "the representation to diagonalize @xmath4 ( the @xmath7-representation ) will be used throughout the paper .",
    "the corresponding classical sa process is described by the master equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the probability that the system is in the @xmath10th state .",
    "we consider single - spin flip processes with the transition matrix elements given as @xmath11    in sa , the temperature @xmath12 is first set to a very large value and then is gradually decreased to zero",
    ". the corresponding process in qa should be to change @xmath3 from a very large value to zero .",
    "the reason is that the high - temperature state in sa is a mixture of all possible states with almost equal probabilities , and the corresponding state in qa is the linear combination of all states with equal amplitude in the @xmath7-representation , which is the lowest eigenstate of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for very large @xmath13 .",
    "the low - temperature state after a successful sa is the ground state of @xmath4 , which should also be the eigenstate of @xmath14 as @xmath3 is reduced to zero sufficiently slowly in qa .",
    "another justification of identification of @xmath13 and @xmath15 comes from the fact that the @xmath16 phase diagram of the hopfield model in a transverse field has almost the same structure as the equilibrium phase diagram of the conventional hopfield model at finite temperature if we identify the temperature axis of the latter phase diagram with the @xmath13 axis in the former @xcite .",
    "we therefore change @xmath3 in qa and @xmath12 in sa from infinity to zero with the same functional forms @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) or @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the reason for choosing these functional forms are that either they allow for analytical solutions in the single - spin case as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] or for comparison with the geman - geman bound mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] .    to compare the performance of the two methods qa and sa",
    ", we calculate the probabilities @xmath21 for qa and @xmath22 for sa , where @xmath23 is the probability to find the system in the ground state at time @xmath24 in sa and @xmath25 is the ground - state wave function of @xmath4 .",
    "note that we treat only small - size systems ( the number of spins @xmath26 ) and thus the ground state can be picked out explicitly . in the ideal situation",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath28 will be very small initially and increase towards 1 as @xmath29 .",
    "it is useful to introduce another set of quantities @xmath30 and @xmath31 . the former is the boltzmann factor of the ground state of @xmath4 at temperature @xmath15 while the latter is defined as @xmath32 , where the wave function @xmath33 is the lowest - energy stationary state of the full hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) for a given fixed value of @xmath13 . in the quasi - static limit , the system follows equilibrium in sa and thus @xmath34 .",
    "correspondingly for qa , @xmath35 when @xmath3 changes sufficiently slowly .",
    "thus the differences between both sides of these two equations give measures how closely the system follows quasi - static states during dynamical process of annealing .",
    "we now present numerical results on @xmath36 and @xmath37 for various types of exchange interactions and transverse fields .",
    "all calculations were performed with a constant longitudinal field @xmath38 to remove trivial degeneracy .",
    "let us first discuss the ferromagnetic ising model with @xmath39 for all pairs of spins .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the overlaps for the case of @xmath40 .",
    "it is seen that both qa and sa follow stationary ( equilibrium ) states during dynamical processes rather accurately . in sa",
    "the theorem of geman and geman @xcite guarantees that the annealing schedule @xmath41 assures convergence to the ground state ( @xmath42 in our notation ) if @xmath1 is adjusted appropriately .",
    "our choice @xmath43 is somewhat arbitrary but the tendency is clear for @xmath42 as @xmath44 , which is also clear from approximate satisfaction of the quasi - equilibrium condition @xmath34 .",
    "although there are no mathematically rigorous arguments for qa corresponding to the geman - geman bound , the numerical data indicate convergence to the ground state under the annealing schedule @xmath45 at least for the ferromagnetic system .",
    "it should be remembered that the unit of time is arbitrary since we have set @xmath46 in the schrdinger equation ( [ schroedinger ] ) and the unit of time @xmath47 in the master equation ( [ master ] ) .",
    "thus the fact that the curves for qa in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] lie below those for sa at any given time does not have any positive significance .",
    "if we decrease the transverse field and the temperature faster , @xmath48 , there appears a qualitative difference between qa and sa as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "the quantum method clearly gives better convergence to the ground state while the classical counterpart gets stuck in a local minimum with a non - negligible probability . to see the rate of approach of @xmath37 to 1 ,",
    "we have plotted @xmath49 in a log - log scale in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "it is seen that @xmath49 behaves as @xmath50 in the time region between 100 and 1000 .    by a still faster annealing schedule @xmath51 ,",
    "the system becomes trapped in intermediate states both in qa and sa as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "we next analyze the interesting case of a frustrated system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "the full lines indicate ferromagnetic interactions while the broken line is for an antiferromagnetic interaction with the same absolute value as the ferromagnetic ones .",
    "if the temperature is very high in the classical case , the spins 4 and 5 are changing their states very rapidly and hence the effective interaction between spins 3 and 6 via spins 4 and 5 will be negligibly small .",
    "thus the direct antiferromagnetic interactions between spins 3 and 6 is expected to dominate the correlation of these spins , which is clearly observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] as the negative value of the thermodynamic correlation function @xmath52 in the high - temperature side . at low temperatures , on the other hand ,",
    "the spins 4 and 5 tend to be fixed in some definite direction and consequently the effective ferromagnetic interactions between spins 3 and 6 are roughly twice as large as the direct antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "this argument is justified by the positive value of the correlation function at low temperatures in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] . therefore the spins",
    "3 and 6 must change their relative orientation at some intermediate temperature .",
    "this means that the free - energy landscape goes under significant restructuring as the temperature is decreased and therefore the annealing process should be performed with sufficient care .",
    "if the transverse field in qa plays a similar role to the temperature in sa , we expect similar dependence of the correlation function @xmath53 on the transverse field @xmath13 . here",
    "the expectation value is evaluated by the stationary eigenfunction of the full hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with the lowest eigenvalue at a given @xmath13 .",
    "the broken curve in fig . [ fig:6 ] clearly supports this idea .",
    "we therefore expect that the frustrated system of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] is a good test ground for comparison of qa and sa in the situation with a significant change of spin configurations in the dynamical process of annealing .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] for the annealing schedule @xmath54 .",
    "the time scale is normalized so that both classical and quantum correlation functions vanish at @xmath55 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "the tendency is clear that qa is better suited for ground - state search in the present system .",
    "the third and final example is the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "interactions exist between all pairs of spins and are chosen from a gaussian distribution with vanishing mean and variance @xmath56 ( @xmath26 in our case ) .",
    "figure [ fig:8 ] shows a typical result on the time evolution of the probabilities under the annealing schedule @xmath57 .",
    "we have checked several realizations of exchange interactions under the same distribution function and have found that the results are qualitatively the same .",
    "figure [ fig:8 ] again suggests that qa is better suited than sa for the present optimization problem .",
    "it is possible to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation explicitly when the problem involves only a single spin and the functional form of the transverse field is @xmath58 or @xmath59 .",
    "we note that the single - spin problem is trivial in sa because there are only two states involved ( up and down ) and thus there are no local minima .",
    "this does not mean that the same single - spin problem is also trivial in the quantum mechanical version .",
    "in qa with a single spin , the transition between the two states is caused by a finite transverse field .",
    "the system goes through tunneling processes to reach the other state , and an approximate annealing schedule is essential to reach the ground state . on the other hand , in sa ,",
    "the transition from the higher state to the lower state takes place even at @xmath16 and thus the system always reaches the ground state .",
    "let us first discuss the case of @xmath60 with @xmath24 changing from @xmath61 to 0 .",
    "this is the well - known landau - zener model and the explicit solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation is available in the literature @xcite . with the notation @xmath62 and @xmath63 and the initial condition @xmath64 ( the lowest eigenstate ) , the solution for @xmath65 is found to be ( see appendix ) @xmath66 where @xmath67 represent the parabolic cylinder function ( or weber function ) and @xmath7 and @xmath68 are given as @xmath69",
    "the final value of @xmath65 at @xmath70 is @xmath71 the probability to find the system in the ground state at @xmath70 is , when @xmath72 , @xmath73 thus the probability @xmath27 does not approach 1 for finite @xmath1 .",
    "we next present the solution for @xmath74 with @xmath24 changing from 0 to @xmath75 under the initial condition @xmath76 ( see appendix ) : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "the asymptotic form of @xmath65 as @xmath44 is @xmath79 the probability to find the system in the target ground state behaves asymptotically as @xmath80 the last approximation being valid for @xmath81 after @xmath44 .",
    "the system does not reach the ground state as @xmath44 as long as @xmath1 is finite .",
    "larger @xmath1 gives more accurate approach to the ground state , which is reasonable because it takes longer time to reach a given value of @xmath82 for larger @xmath1 , implying slower annealing .",
    "the final example of the solvable model concerns the annealing schedule @xmath83 .",
    "the solution for @xmath65 is derived in appendix under the initial condition @xmath76 as @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the large-@xmath24 behavior is found to be @xmath86,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the probability @xmath87 for @xmath88 is obtained as @xmath89 this equation indicates that the single - spin system does not reach the ground state under the present annealing schedule @xmath83 for which the numerical data in the previous section suggested an accurate approach .",
    "we therefore conclude that the asymptotic value of @xmath27 in the previous section may not be exactly equal to 1 for @xmath90 although it is very close to 1 .",
    "the annealing schedule @xmath83 has a feature which distinguishes this function from the other ones @xmath19 and @xmath91 . as we saw in the previous discussion ,",
    "the final asymptotic value of @xmath27 is not 1 if the initial condition corresponds to the ground state for @xmath92 , @xmath76 .",
    "however , as shown in appendix , by an appropriate choice of the initial condition , it is possible to drive the system to the ground state if @xmath83 .",
    "this is not possible for any initial conditions in the case of @xmath60 or @xmath91 .",
    "we have proposed the idea of quantum annealing ( qa ) in which quantum tunneling effects cause transitions between states in optimization problem , in contrast to the usual thermal transitions in simulated annealing ( sa ) .",
    "the idea was tested in the transverse ising model obeying the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the transverse field term was controlled so that the system approaches the ground state .",
    "the numerical results on the probability to find the system in the ground state were compared with the corresponding probability derived from the numerical solution of the master equation representing the sa processes . we have found that qa shows convergence to the optimal ( ground ) state with larger probability than sa in all cases if the same annealing schedule is used .",
    "the system approaches the ground state rather accurately in qa for the annealing schedule @xmath93 but not for faster decrease of the transverse field .",
    "we have also solved the single - spin model exactly for qa in the cases of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the results showed that the ground state is not reached perfectly for all these annealing schedules .",
    "therefore the asymptotic values of @xmath27 in numerical calculations are probably not exactly 1 although they seem to be quite close to the optimal value 1 .    the rate of approach to the asymptotic value close to 1 , @xmath94 , was found to be proportional to @xmath95 in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] for the ferromagnetic model . on the other hand ,",
    "the single - spin solution shows the existence of a term proportional to @xmath96 , see eq .",
    "( [ asym ] ) .",
    "probably the coefficient of the @xmath96-term is very small in the situation of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] and the next - order contribution dominates in the time region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .    a simple argument using perturbation theory yields useful information about the asymptotic form of the probability function if we assume that the system follows quasi - static states during dynamical processes .",
    "the probability to find the system in the ground state is expressed using the perturbation in terms of @xmath97 as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the energy of the @xmath10th state of the non - perturbed ( classical ) system and @xmath100 is the ground - state energy .",
    "if we set @xmath101 , we have @xmath102 thus the approach to the asymptotic value is proportional to @xmath95 as long as the system stays in quasi - static states .",
    "the corresponding probability for sa is @xmath103 which shows absence of universal ( @xmath95-like ) dependence on time .    the present method of qa bears some similarity to the approach by the generalized transition probability in which the dynamics is described by the master equation but the transition probability has power - law dependence on the temperature in contrast to the usual exponential form of the boltzmann factor @xcite .",
    "this power - law dependence on the temperature allows the system to search for a wider region in the phase space because of larger probabilities of transition to higher - energy states at a given @xmath12 , which may be the reason of faster convergence to the optimal states @xcite .",
    "the transverse field term @xmath13 in our qa represents the rate of transition between states which is larger than the transition rate in sa ( see ( [ rate ] ) ) at a given small value of the control parameter @xmath104 .",
    "this larger transition probability may lead to a more active search in wider regions of the phase space , leading to better convergence similarly to the case of the generalized transition probability .",
    "we have solved the schrdinger equation and the master equation directly by numerical methods for the purpose of comparison of qa and sa .",
    "this method faces difficulties for larger @xmath105 because the number of states increases exponentially as @xmath106 .",
    "the classical sa solves this problem by exploiting stochastic processes , monte carlo simulations , which have the computational complexity growing as a power of @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding reduction of the computational complexity is lacking in qa , and it is an important future problem in practical implementation of the idea of qa .",
    "another future problem is to devise implementations of qa in other optimization problems such as the travelling salesman problem or the graph bipartitioning for which there seems to be no direct analogue of the transverse field to cause quantum transitions .",

    "<S> the goal is to find the ground state of the diagonal part of the hamiltonian with high accuracy as quickly as possible . </S>",
    "<S> we have solved the time - dependent schrdinger equation numerically for small size systems with various exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with the results of the corresponding classical ( thermal ) method reveals that the quantum annealing leads to the ground state with much larger probability in almost all cases if we use the same annealing schedule . </S>"
