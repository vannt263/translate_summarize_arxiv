    "if supersymmetry is realized in nature , and if it plays a role in resolving the hierarchy problem associated with the quadratically divergent quantum corrections to the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , then it is explicitly broken ( as dictated by experiment ) at the electroweak scale ( as dictated by its solution to the hierarchy problem ) . the breaking is often assumed to be soft so that the theory is at most logarithmically divergent and no new hierarchy problem appears .",
    "hence , the dynamics of the scalar fields @xmath0 , for example , is described by a potential of the form @xmath1 in the first ( @xmath2-)term , @xmath3 is the superpotential , is a chiral superfield , @xmath4 is the superspace coordinate , and @xmath5 is a fermion . ]",

    ", @xmath10 is the gauge coupling , and a summation over all gauge groups and generators @xmath11 is implied .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath13terms dictate , in this description , all quartic interactions which preserve ( up to logarithmic corrections @xcite ) the supersymmetric structure .",
    "all other terms break supersymmetry softly .",
    "note that the soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) parameters are necessarily dimensionful ( due to the softness requirement ) .",
    "indeed , this is the minimal description of supersymmetric extensions of the sm , with the exception of the non - holomorphic @xmath14-parameters which may not be soft in models containing pure singlets ( and which are often omitted ) .",
    "while the @xmath12 and @xmath13terms preserve supersymmetry and depend on the gauge and yukawa structure of the low - energy theory , the ssb terms should depend on the ultraviolet supersymmetry breaking vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "as such , they depend on , and encode , hidden ultraviolet physics .",
    "spontaneous supersymmetry breaking is most conveniently parameterized in terms of a spurion field @xmath15 with a non vanishing @xmath2-vev , which is an order parameter of ( global ) supersymmetry breaking .",
    "all ssb parameters can be written as nonrenormalizable operators which couple the spurion @xmath16 to the sm superfields .",
    "the operators are suppressed by the scale of the mediation of supersymmetry breaking from the ( hidden ) sector parameterized by the spurion to the sm ( observable ) sector .",
    "the coefficients of the various operators are dictated by the nature of the interaction between the sectors and by the loop - order at which it occurs . in the following ,",
    "we will explicitly write all operators which couple the two sectors . this will allow us to consider a more general and complete form of the supersymmetry breaking potential , which still resolves the hierarchy problem .",
    "while we will also identify the operators which correspond to the ssb parameters , our focus will be on those operators which are not included in the minimal form of the potential ( [ vssb ] ) .",
    "this will be done in sec .",
    "[ sec : hard ] .",
    "eventhough the ssb parameters appearing in ( [ vssb ] ) are functions of the relevant ultraviolet scales , their magnitude is uniquely determined by the assumption that supersymmetry stabilizes the weak scale against divergent quantum corrections , @xmath17 gev etc .",
    "this places a constraint on the ratio of the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath18 and the scale of its mediation @xmath19 such that @xmath20 , and it implies that no information can be extracted regarding either scale from the ssb parameters .",
    "( we will comment on the case of @xmath14 below . )",
    "the generalization of ( [ vssb ] ) introduces dimensionless hard supersymmetry breaking ( hsb ) parameters in the potential .",
    "their magnitude depends on the various scales in a way which both provides useful information ( unlike the ssb parameters ) and does not destabilize the solution to the hierarchy problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec : higgs ] we will demonstrate this while calculating the higgs mass , which will provide a concrete example .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "it is convenient to contain , without loss of generality , all observable - hidden interactions in the non - holomorphic kahler potential @xmath21 , @xmath22 ( which is not protected by nonrenormalization theorems ) .",
    "we therefore turn to a general classification of @xmath21-operators , originally presented in ref .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "we do not impose any global symmetries , which can obviously eliminate some of the operators , and we keep all operators which survive the superspace integration .",

    "the effective low - energy kahler potential of a rigid @xmath23 supersymmetry theory supersymmetry under certain assumptions @xcite . ] is given by @xmath24 where , as before , @xmath16 is the spurion and @xmath25 are the chiral superfields of the low - energy theory .",
    "@xmath26 is the covariant derivative with respect to the superspace chiral coordinate @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the @xmath23 gauge supermultiplet in its chiral representation , @xmath29 , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 here being the gaugino and vector boson , respectively .",
    "once a separation between supersymmetry breaking field @xmath16 and low - energy @xmath25 fields is imposed , there is no tree - level renormalizable interaction between the two sets of fields , and their mixing can arise only at the non - renormalizable level @xmath32 .",
    "the superspace integration @xmath33 reduces @xmath34 and @xmath35 to the usual ssb terms , as well as the superpotential @xmath36-parameter @xmath37 , which were discussed in the previous section .",

    "these are summarized in tables   [ table : o1 ] and  [ table : o1b ] .",
    "( we did not include linear terms that may appear in the case of a singlet superfield . )",
    "finally , the last term in table  [ table : o1 ] contains correlated but unusual quartic and yukawa couplings .",
    "they are soft as they involve at most logarithmic divergences .",
    "integration over @xmath39 produces non - standard soft terms , one of which was discussed in the previous section .",
    "these terms are soft unless the theory contains a pure singlet field , in which case they can induce a quadratically divergent linear term .",
    "they are summarized in table  [ table : o2 ] .",
    "the integration over @xmath39 also generates contributions to the ( `` standard '' ) @xmath40 and gaugino - mass terms .",
    "these terms could arise at lower orders in @xmath41 from integration over holomorphic functions ( and in the case of @xmath42 , also from @xmath34 ) .",
    "however , this is equivalent to integration over @xmath21 if @xmath43 . note that in the presence of superpotential yukawa couplings , a supersymmetry breaking higgsino mass term @xmath44 can be rotated to a combination of @xmath36 and @xmath45 terms , and vice versa .",
    "lastly , superspace integration over @xmath46 leads to dimensionless hard operators .",
    "these are summarized in table  [ table : o3 ] , and will occupy the remaining of this lecture .",
    "table  [ table : o3 ] also contain supersymmetry breaking gauge - yukawa interactions @xmath47 .",
    "this is equivalent to the hsb kinetic term for the gauginos which was discussed recently in ref .",

    "hsb effects are now more moderate but can increase the higgs mass by 40 ( 10 ) gev for @xmath94 ( in comparison to the case with only ssb . )",
    "although the increase in the higgs mass in this case is not as large as in the tlm and npgm cases , it is of the same order of magnitude as , or larger than , the two - loop corrections due to ssb @xcite , setting the uncertainty range on any such calculation .",

    "once @xmath95 is measured , more stringent bounds on @xmath19 could be set . in conclusion",
    ", this section illustrates that the scale of the mediation of supersymmetry breaking explicitly appears in the prediction of the higgs mass ( and with a distinct @xmath62-dependence ) . in turn",
    ", it could lead in certain cases to a much heavier higgs boson than usually anticipated in supersymmetric theories .",
    "it could also distinguish models , e.g. , supergravity mediation from other low - energy mediation and weakly from strongly interacting messenger sectors . given our ignorance of the ( kahler potential and ) hsb terms , such effects can serve for setting the uncertainty on any higgs mass calculations and can be used to qualitatively constrain the scale of mediation of supersymmetry breaking from the hidden to the sm sector .",
    "the most general treatment of the mediation of supersymmetry breaking requires the parameterization of the various ssb and hsb parameters in terms of the scale of supersymmetry breaking and of the scale of its mediation to the low - energy fields .",
    "this introduces in the infrared potential supersymmetry breaking parameters whose magnitude is not fixed by the weak scale , yet they do not destabilize the weak scale . while in some cases the parameters are very small , their effects need not be negligible .",
    "for example , in supergravity mediation they could lead to sizeable correction to the ssb parameters . in theories of low - energy supersymmetry breaking , such as gauge mediation",
    ", the effects could be even more dramatic , as illustrated in our discussion of the higgs mass .",
    "furthermore , the effects of , e.g. , quartic couplings @xmath108 may allow one to indirectly measure the scale @xmath19 , as well as to determine the dynamics responsible for supersymmetry breaking ( as in the case of strongly @xmath109 weakly interacting messenger sectors ) .",
    "other interesting possibilities not explored here include chiral symmetry breaking and fermion mass generations @xcite ; theories of extended supersymmetry @xcite and their accommodation of experimental constraints @xcite ; non - holomorphic trilinear interactions and their effect on the stability of the vacuum @xcite ; supergravity boundary conditions @xcite ; higgsino mass generation @xcite ; theories with singlets @xcite ; and stabilization of flat potentials @xcite .",
    "the relevance of various issues depends on the scale of supersymmetry breaking , which for the time being remains a free parameter . treating it as such can illuminate some of the mysteries of the superworld as well as help in identifying various phenomena .",
