    "that there is a strong connection between bipartite entanglement and subsystem fluctuations is well - known .",
    "previous studies on bipartite ground states of critical spin chains revealed that subsystem fluctuations in a conserved charge have the same ( logarithmic ) scaling with subsystem size as the entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "further investigations on one - dimensional free fermion systems have shown that rnyi entanglement entropies can be expressed in terms of the cumulants of the fermion number distribution within a partition @xcite .",
    "additionally , the link between entanglement and fluctuations has been studied in the context of cosmological models @xcite and topological invariants @xcite .",
    "simple qualitative arguments can provide insight into the deep relationship between fluctuations and entanglement .",
    "when a pure state is partitioned into two entangled subsystems , the state of either can not be specified by a single state vector .",
    "the complete description of a subsystem ( say @xmath1 ) requires a reduced density operator @xmath2 that is mixed @xcite . the statistical uncertainty in determining the state of this partition manifests as a non - zero entanglement entropy , as well as non - zero fluctuations in subsystem observables that originate from inter - partition quantum correlations . in fact",
    ", the range of these correlations has been demonstrated to be a crucial factor in determining whether an entanglement area law will hold or not @xcite .",
    "entanglement in a pure state @xmath3 that is partitioned into a subsystem @xmath1 and bath @xmath4 is completely characterized by the entanglement spectrum @xcite that consists of the eigenvalues of the reduced density operator @xmath5 .",
    "due to normalization and the hermiticity of @xmath2 , this spectrum has @xmath6 independent real parameters when @xmath2 is of rank @xmath0 .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to assume that a set of @xmath6 independent fluctuation measurements can fully characterize entanglement in such a bipartitioned state .",
    "for example , take the case of two entangled qubits in an overall pure state .",
    "the entanglement spectrum is @xmath7 so that entanglement measures @xcite , such as the von neumann entanglement entropy @xmath8 , purity @xmath9 , and concurrence @xmath10 @xcite , depend on a single real parameter @xmath11 . for qubits ,",
    "it is well - established that these entanglement measures are related to a subsystem fluctuation or variance .",
    "for instance , if we define an entanglement hamiltonian as @xmath12 , a direct calculation leads to a fluctuation - entanglement relation of the form @xmath13 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we expand the notion of fluctuation - entanglement relations to the case of an arbitrary pure state partitioned into a @xmath14-state qudit and bath in such a way that the qudit is described by a reduced density operator of rank @xmath15 .",
    "our main result is the identification of a set of @xmath6 operators that have fluctuations that collectively measure entanglement through a fluctuation - entanglement relation .",
    "we begin with a brief introduction to some notation and terminology , especially on the bloch representation of reduced density operators @xmath2 as a linear combination of @xmath16(@xmath0 ) generators @xmath17 and the identity operator ( section  [ generators ] ) .",
    "we then express the variance of an @xmath6 component subsystem observable @xmath18 @xmath19 in terms of known entanglement measures like the linear entropy @xmath20 @xcite and a generalized concurrence @xmath21 @xcite ( section  [ schmidtpolfluc ] ) : @xmath22 here we refer to the total fluctuation @xmath23 as the schmidt polarization fluctuation .",
    "this exact fluctuation - entanglement relation is true for any qudit - bath pure state and provides a particularly clear and simple mathematical basis for the intuitive link between entanglement and subsystem fluctuations , especially in a many - body context .",
    "furthermore , this exact relation allows ( i ) recent experimental measurements of purity in many - body systems @xcite to be interpreted as direct measures of subsystem fluctuations and ( ii ) noise measurements ( as in spin noise experiments @xcite ) to be interpreted as direct entanglement measurements .",
    "we provide examples for cases when the subsystem partition is further decomposable into a product state ( section  [ sect : comp ] ) and when it is expressible in matrix product form ( section  [ sect : aklt ] ) .",
    "a set of @xmath25 @xmath24 generators that generalizes the @xmath26 pauli operators contains the following elements : @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30 is an orthonormal set of @xmath0 state vectors that span a partition subspace @xcite . for notational convenience ,",
    "these generators are often labeled as @xmath31 .",
    "these @xmath25 operators are traceless and satisfy @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , they are hermitian and therefore represent observables on the corresponding partition .    any rank-@xmath0 reduced density operator @xmath33 can be written as a linear combination of the @xmath24 generators @xmath34 and the @xmath0-dimensional identity @xmath35 : @xmath36 the constants @xmath37 form the components of an @xmath38 dimensional bloch vector ( or coherence vector ) @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the components of this bloch vector are @xmath40 which are expectation values of observables and thus experimentally accessible .",
    "fluctuations in these observables have been used to construct a fluctuation - entanglement relation under the framework of generalized entanglement relative to the distinguished subset of observables @xmath17 @xcite . in this framework",
    ", one defines a vector @xmath41 so that the total component - wise fluctuation in @xmath42 is @xmath43 each term in this expression is readily evaluated .",
    "the first term is the expectation value of the quadratic casimir invariant @xmath44 .",
    "the second term is the square of the bloch vector , which can be expressed in terms of the purity @xmath45 according to @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we thus obtain a fluctuation - entanglement relation @xmath47 calculating the fluctuation term in the left - hand side of this relation requires @xmath25 measurements .",
    "it contains the same information as the @xmath25 independent real parameters @xmath48 needed to completely specify the reduced density operator @xmath2 .",
    "the main goal now in the remainder of this paper is to identify a set of @xmath6 fluctuation measurements that is equivalent to the set of @xmath6 independent eigenvalues of @xmath2 .",
    "that is , we seek a set of fluctuations that corresponds to complete knowledge of the independent elements of the entanglement spectrum @xmath49 @xcite , thereby quantifying entanglement in an arbitrary pure state .",
    "achieving this goal requires a set of @xmath6 compatible observables that commute with the reduced density operator @xmath2 .",
    "a particularly convenient set is formed by the @xmath6 diagonal generators @xmath50 that are constructed from the schmidt basis . in the following analysis , we find that the fluctuations in the non - diagonal generators @xmath51 and @xmath52 sum trivially in this basis .",
    "let us consider a state vector @xmath53 that is partitioned into subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath4 with schmidt rank @xmath0 : @xmath54 the set of state vectors @xmath55 form an orthonormal basis in the hilbert subspace of partition @xmath56 .",
    "hence , the reduced density operator for subsystem @xmath1 is diagonal in this schmidt basis : @xmath57 here the partial trace @xmath58 is performed over the @xmath59 states . for brevity",
    ", we will often omit the partition label subscripts on the state vectors as the reduced density operator is understood to act on the hilbert subspace of a given partition .    in the following discussion",
    "we define the schmidt polarization fluctuation and obtain fluctuation - entanglement relations in terms of known entanglement measures .",
    "we begin with the simplest case of a qubit entangled with a bath before proceeding with the general qudit case .      in schmidt",
    "decomposed form , the full density operator of a qubit @xmath1 entangled with an arbitrary environment @xmath4 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "the reduced density operator for the qubit in the schmidt basis @xmath62 is therefore @xmath63    it turns out that we can construct an entanglement measure that depends only on the fluctuation in the polarization of the qubit with respect to the schmidt states @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "let this polarization be represented by the diagonal @xmath26 generator @xmath66 , which corresponds to the pauli @xmath67-matrix in the schmidt basis .",
    "we therefore have @xmath68 and @xmath69 measures the relative probability of finding the qubit in either of its schmidt states : it is equal to @xmath70 if the qubit is certainly in state @xmath64 , @xmath71 if certainly in state @xmath65 , and zero when it is in either state with equal probability .",
    "let us define the corresponding schmidt polarization fluctuation as @xmath72 it is evident that this fluctuation is a proper entanglement measure because it is a monotonic function of the qubit concurrence @xmath21 and , upon rearrangement , the linear entropy @xmath20 : @xmath73= 2(1-\\gamma ) = 2s_l .\\ ] ] this simple result now sets the stage for a more general fluctuation - entanglement relation that applies to an @xmath0-level subsystem .",
    "the main challenge addressed in this paper is to generalize the previously derived relationship between the schmidt polarization fluctuation and entanglement measures to the case of an entangled @xmath14-state qudit . to this end",
    ", we write the qudit ( @xmath1 ) reduced density operator in terms of the schmidt basis : @xmath74 where @xmath15 .",
    "that is , the dimension of the hilbert subspace spanned by the schmidt vectors is at most equal to the dimension of the full hilbert space of the partition .",
    "we now define @xmath6 polarization observables in terms of the diagonal @xmath24 generators so that @xmath75 the generalized polarization expectation values are @xmath76 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] physically , the quantity @xmath77 may be interpreted as a weighted relative probability of finding the qudit in one of the @xmath78 schmidt states @xmath30 against finding it in the state @xmath79 . furthermore , the polarization operators may be used to define a polarization vector @xmath18 , where @xmath80 is a set of @xmath6 orthonormal vectors .",
    "this construction allows the sum of polarization fluctuations to be written as @xmath81    we propose that the generalization of the qubit schmidt polarization fluctuation @xmath82 in the case of a rank @xmath0 subsystem is the variance in the polarization vector : @xmath83 . \\label{wqudit}\\ ] ] this sum involves fluctuations in the @xmath6 diagonal generators @xmath50 , which may be measured through appropriately generalized stern",
    " gerlach - type experiments . to prove that the schmidt polarization fluctuation @xmath23 is indeed a proper entanglement measure for the qudit - bath system ,",
    "we demonstrate that it is a monotonic function of known entanglement measures .",
    "first , the sum of the mean squares of the polarizations is @xmath84 the sum of squares of the average polarizations takes some more effort to evaluate : @xmath85.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] however , changing the summation order leads to simpler sums and we get @xmath86 the latter term is simplified by the normalization condition @xmath87 , which yields @xcite @xmath88 combining these results finally gives the desired fluctuation - entanglement relation between the schmidt polarization fluctuation and known entanglement measures : @xmath89 here , @xmath21 is a generalized concurrence that has been reported in ref .",
    "when the pure state is maximally entangled , the total schmidt polarization fluctuation is equal to @xmath90 .",
    "in the many - body context it may occur that the reduced density operator can be easily simplified into a product : @xmath91 it is therefore important to determine how the schmidt polarization fluctuations of independent subsystems relate to the total entanglement in composite subsystems .",
    "given that the schmidt polarization fluctuation of both components are known , @xmath92 we are able to construct the fluctuation - entanglement relation for the composite system .",
    "the total purity of @xmath2 is @xmath93 because purity is multiplicative over independent subsystems .",
    "the relationship between the total purity of the subsystem and the component schmidt polarization fluctuations is therefore @xmath94 since @xmath95 , the polarization fluctuations are only approximately additive when higher order products of fluctuations are negligible .    in a decomposition with @xmath96 qudits , @xmath97 ,",
    "the fluctuation - entanglement relation becomes @xmath98.\\ ] ] an important situation where such a decomposition is analytically tractable is encountered in the case of non - interacting spinless fermions hopping on a one - dimensional lattice @xcite . in the pure ground state of this system , the reduced density operator corresponding to a block of @xmath96 adjacent sites can be written as a product of @xmath96 qubit density matrices .",
    "thus , the identity generalizes the determinant formulas for the entanglement entropy of free fermions @xcite that have been evaluated by the fisher  hartwig relation @xcite . as an illustration",
    ", we give the results of calculations of the block linear entropy @xmath99 in such a chain of fermions for several fermion densities @xmath100 in figure  [ fig : freefermions ] . in this graph",

    "future work on the @xmath96 qudit formula can extend this result to the case of multi - component atomic systems .",
    "studies of entanglement in quantum spin chains have proved useful for the description of wires that can transmit quantum information between registers @xcite as well as for providing tractable theoretical models for investigating the relationship between entanglement and quantum critical phenomena @xcite . as an example , we consider the valence - bond solid ( vbs ) ground state of the spin-1 affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) model @xcite : @xmath109 the vbs ground state is separated from excited states by a haldane gap @xcite and the entanglement entropy saturates for long blocks .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions on the spin-1 operators @xmath110 and take the thermodynamic limit @xmath111 .",
    "the reduced density operator @xmath112 for a contiguous block of @xmath113 spins can be calculated from the matrix product representation of the vbs state @xcite .",
    "although the full hilbert space for the block is @xmath114-dimensional , the reduced density operator is at most rank-4 .",
    "its eigenvalues are @xmath115 the fluctuation in the schmidt polarization vector is @xmath116 where the relevant polarization operators in the schmidt basis are @xmath117 the fluctuation - entanglement relation therefore gives the subsystem purity as @xmath118 which converges exponentially fast with @xmath113 to the maximally entangled value @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "subsystem fluctuations have been studied as probes of entanglement , with notable results for many - body systems @xcite .",
    "still , only few exact and general relationships have been derived between an entanglement entropy and a subsystem variance in the many - body situation .",
    "specific results have been reported for the case of independent qubits @xcite , one - dimensional free fermions @xcite , and luttinger liquids @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have derived a model - independent fluctuation - entanglement relation that provides a general , yet simple , quantitative basis to the long - held assertion that subsystem fluctuations can measure entanglement .",
    "our result implies that it takes @xmath6 fluctuation measurements to construct a fluctuation - based entanglement measure for a rank-@xmath0 reduced density operator .",
    "in fact , since the fluctuation @xmath120 depends on the first @xmath121 eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , knowledge of these @xmath6 fluctuations is equivalent to knowledge of the full entanglement spectrum @xmath122 .",
    "it therefore becomes increasingly cumbersome to use such a measure for a general entangled many - body system with exponentially large schmidt rank .",
    "however , there are broad classes of many - body states that have reduced density matrices with well - bounded rank as in the examples presented here : models mappable onto one - dimensional free fermions @xcite , and matrix product states and the states that are well - approximated by them @xcite .",
