    "<S> achieving blockade conditions can be challenging since both photons have to be localized within the blockade volume . following @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we here propose a storage - based scheme that instead relies on the interaction between two stationary rydberg excitations .    </S>",

    "<S> errors in the perpendicular dimension are much less critical @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> photon loss that is uniform over the four rails has no effect on the conditional fidelity as defined above . </S>",
    "<S> it can therefore be discussed independently in terms of the efficiency @xmath67 , which is the probability of retrieving each photon after the gate operation . </S>",
    "<S> non - uniform loss terms in our scheme can be made uniform by adding external sources of loss to certain rails , see supplementary information @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ swapping](e ) for different interaction times in an ensemble cooled to t=0.1  @xmath43k . </S>",
    "<S> considering the separation of interacting rails , there is a trade - off between fidelity and efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> a small separation improves the efficiency by reducing the interaction time ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ swapping](e ) ) , but the resulting stronger interaction causes more entanglement and momentum displacement , which reduces the fidelity ( see fig .  [ swapping](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the swapping protocol makes it possible to achieve high fidelity and high efficiency simultaneously .    </S>",
    "<S> another significant source of inefficiency comes from the process of storage and retrieval of single photons . </S>",
    "<S> a conservative estimate of the associated efficiency for the whole protocol ( including the swapping ) can be obtained by applying the photon s storage and retrieval efficiency twice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the use of two separate mots for storing photons before and after swapping . </S>",
    "<S> based on this estimate the overall efficiency for a density of @xmath40  @xmath41 ( corresponding to an optical depth @xmath68 ) is about 70% . increasing the density to @xmath69  @xmath41 ( @xmath70 ) improves the efficiency of repeated storage and retrieval to 95% . in practice </S>",
    "<S> using a single mot is likely to both be more practical and lead to higher efficiency than these estimates because in this case the stationary excitations only have to be converted into moving excitations ( but not all the way into photons ) at the intermediate stage .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown how to compensate the effect of momentum displacement on the fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> the other destructive effect of the interaction that reduces the fidelity is the creation of unwanted entanglement between the collective excitations . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement reduces the fidelity by deforming the two - excitation wave function in momentum space , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ siky](b ) ( see also fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) in the supplemental materials @xcite ) . comparing the eccentricities of the ellipses in parallel and perpendicular direction obtained from eq .  ( [ sipp ] ) , @xmath71 </S>",
    "<S> , one sees that the deformation is much stronger for the parallel dimension . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , compression of the collective excitations parallel to their separation can reduce the unwanted entanglement while leaving room for extra atoms in the perpendicular dimensions in order to preserve the directionality of the collective emission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the highly non - isotropic effects of profile compression on the fidelity are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ entanglement](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the achievable width compression is mainly limited by diffraction . in order to show the relation between fidelity and entanglement </S>",
    "<S> even more clearly we calculate the von neumann entropy of the output state . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ entanglement](b ) shows that fidelity reduction and entanglement are indeed proportional .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a photon - photon gate protocol that uses stationary collective rydberg excitations , but does not rely on photon blockade . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that unwanted effects due to the distance - dependence of the interaction are important but can be overcome , making it realistic to achieve a gate operation with high fidelity and efficiency .    </S>",
