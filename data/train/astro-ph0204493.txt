    "the study of galaxy groups is a very interesting area of research because these density fluctuations lay between galaxies and clusters of galaxies and may provide important clues to galaxy formation .    since the appearing of large galaxy redshift surveys more reliable detection of group of galaxies have been possible .",
    "two pioneer works develop the main identification algorithms .",
    "the first was introduced by huchra & geller ( 1992 ) and the second was proposed by nolthenius & white ( 1987 ) ; both are friends - of - friends algorithms , differing only in the scaling of the linking lengths .",
    "frederic ( 1995 ) perform an extensive study of these algorithms using n - body simulations , concluding that neither of them is intrinsically superior to the other , and the choice of one of them depends on the purpose for which groups are to be studied . recently",
    "several catalogues have been constructed from different large galaxy redshift surveys using these algorithms .",
    "merchn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) use the updated zwicky catalogue ( falco et al .",
    "1999 ) generating a sample of 517 galaxy groups . using the nearby optical galaxy sample , giuricin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) construct one of the large catalogue of loose groups and tucker et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found 1495 groups in the las campanas redshift survey .",
    "finally , ramella et al . (",
    "2002 ) generate a group catalogue of 1168 members from the combination of the updated zwicky catalogue and the southern sky redshift survey ( da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "= 0.7    at the present , the largest sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts ( @xmath4 ) is the anglo - australian two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( hereafter 2dfgrs , colless et al .",
    "the survey covers @xmath5 and has a median depth @xmath6 .",
    "several studies were done with this preliminary sample by the 2dfgrs team .",
    "some of then are the power spectrum of galaxies ( percival et al .",
    "2001 ) , the projected two point correlation function of galaxies for different volume limited samples ( norberg et al .",
    "2001a ) , and the estimation of the @xmath7 band galaxy luminosity function ( norberg et al . 2001b ) .",
    "another study related with system of galaxies in the 2dfgrs has been carried out by de propris et al .",
    "( 2002 ) where they present an study of 3-dimensional galaxy clusters based on well known bidimensional galaxy clusters .",
    "the large number of galaxies and the depth of the 2dfgrs make it very suitable for galaxy groups identification .",
    "nevertheless the present release of the sample is not uniform due to variations in sky coverage which make difficult the analysis of the data .",
    "the main objective of this work is the identification of groups in the 2dfgrs and estimation of their physical properties ( number of members , velocity dispersion , virial radius and mass ) . in order to take into account the variation in the sky coverage of the 2dfgrs",
    "we introduce a couple of modifications to the group - finding algorithm developed by huchra & geller ( 1982 ) .",
    "the first one deals with the apparent magnitude limit variation across the sky and the second is related to redshift completeness .",
    "these modifications are tested using mock catalogues which reproduce each effect separately .",
    "we also use these mock catalogues to explore the space of linking parameters to maximize group identification accuracy .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the catalogue is described in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we describe the group finder algorithm used to identify galaxy groups in the 2dfgrs .",
    "a detailed test of the method is performed in section 4 .",
    "finally , the 2df group catalogue is presented in section 5 followed by conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the complete 2dfgrs will consist of approximately 250000 galaxies with redshifts in two declination strips plus 100 random 2-degree fields .",
    "all targets are selected in the photometric @xmath8 band from the apm galaxy survey ( maddox et al .",
    "1990a , b;1996 ) . the southern strip ( sgp )",
    "covers approximately 1275 square degrees ( @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ) and the northern strip ( ngp ) covers 750 square degrees ( @xmath11 ; @xmath12 ) while the 100 random fields are spread uniformly over the 7000 square degrees in the southern region .",
    "in our analysis we use the 2df public 100k data release of galaxies with the best redshift estimates within the two main strips ( ngp and sgp ) of the catalogue . given the status of the project , the sky coverage of the sample is not uniform , so a detailed completeness description is needed ( see figure [ fig : pos ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we use in our analysis the 2dfgrs mask software constructed by peder norberg and shaun cole which take into account both the magnitude limit and the redshift completeness ( see also figure 13 and 15 of colless et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the redshift completeness was defined with the @xmath13 field used to tile the survey region for spectroscopic observations .",
    "this quantity is the ratio of the number of galaxies for which redshifts have been obtained to the total number of objects contained in the parent catalogue and has a mean value of @xmath14 for the whole sample . on the other hand",
    ", the magnitude limit mask corresponds to variations of the parent survey magnitude limit with the position on the sky .",
    "this variation span over a magnitude limit range of @xmath15 for the ngp and a range of @xmath16 for the sgp .",
    "this sample comprise 102426 galaxies with final @xmath8 magnitudes corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "for group identification we use a friends - of - friends algorithm similar to that described by huchra & geller ( 1982 ) modified in order to take into account redshift completeness and magnitude limit variations .",
    "if we have a pair of galaxies with mean radial velocity @xmath17 and angular separation @xmath18 , our algorithm links galaxies when the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the angular separation and @xmath22 is the line - of - sight velocity difference .",
    "the transverse @xmath23 and radial linking lengths @xmath24 are scaled as @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively in order to compensate for the decline of the selection function with distance .",
    "the scaled factor is computed as @xmath27^{-1/3}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the absolute magnitude of the brightest galaxy visible at a distance @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . in these equations ,",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are the linking cutoffs at the fiducial velocity @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the galaxy luminosity function of the sample .    in the special case of the 2dfgrs",
    ", we should take into account the magnitude limit and completeness variations through the sky . the adopted way to solve this issue",
    "consists in defining an average magnitude limit for each pair @xmath36 and redefining the scale factor @xmath37 as @xmath38^{-1/3}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the corresponding completeness values for each galaxy position on the sky .",
    "to examine the degree of accuracy of our algorithm we use a set of mocks catalogues constructed from a gravitational numerical simulation of a flat low density cold dark matter universe .",
    "we perform this simulation using the hydra nbody code developed by couchman et .",
    "al ( 1995 ) with @xmath41 particles in a cubic comoving volume of 180 @xmath42 mpc per side starting at z=50 .",
    "the adopted cosmological model was a universe with @xmath43 , @xmath44 , hubble constant @xmath45 and a relative mass fluctuation of @xmath46 .",
    "= 0.5    = 0.5    in order to reproduce the same radial distribution as in the 2dfgrs , we adopt a galaxy luminosity function fitted by a schechter function with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and a model of the average k+e correction given by the formula @xmath50 ( see norberg et al .",
    "2001b ) . combining these models and using the positions from the simulation we generate an apparent magnitude @xmath51 for each particle inside the angular mask described in section 2 .",
    "we construct four mock catalogues with different sky coverage :    * in the first mock we introduce a fixed faint survey magnitude limit ( @xmath52 ) ; * the second mock has a fixed faint survey magnitude limit and the effect of redshift completeness as in the real survey ( @xmath53 ) ; * the third mock has a faint survey magnitude limit which changes with the angular position of a particle in the same way as the magnitude limit mask of the 2dfgrs ( @xmath54 ) ; * finally , the fourth mock have both effects , the magnitude limit mask and the redshift completeness mask ( @xmath55 ) .      from the mock catalogues described in the previous section , we identify groups in real and redshift spaces .",
    "the former identification is carried out using the same linking length in both directions ( @xmath56 ) whereas different linking lengths are used in redshift space .",
    "the fiducial velocity @xmath34 is adopted as 1000 @xmath57 @xmath58 in all identifications .",
    "the linking lengths are selected spanning the space parameter ( @xmath33 , @xmath59 ) where the later is the number density contour surrounding a group and corresponds to a fixed number density enhancement relative to the mean number density of @xmath60 the selected values are :    * @xmath33 : 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 and 500 @xmath57 @xmath58 * @xmath59 : 20 , 40 , 80 and 160    to quantify how good are the groups identified in redshift space we implement a method to match the center of mass of these groups with the center of mass of groups in real space .",
    "our method seeks for groups in real space within a projected and a radial distance having its origin in the center of mass of each group in redshift space .",
    "we choose the searching parameters in order to maximize the matching , nevertheless the results are very stable around the chosen values .",
    "the results show that almost all groups have one match inside the limits and only a few are related with two or three groups in real space . in the later situation we choose to associate the group in redshift space with that group in real space with more shared particles .",
    "= 0.5    .percentage of spurious groups identified in the @xmath55 mock [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the group properties estimation could be biased by the geometrical and sampling effects in the 2df catalog . to deal with border effects",
    "we create a simple magnitude limited mock catalogue where limits in declination and right ascension exceed the corresponding to the 2df catalog .",
    "consequently we identify groups in this mock catalogue keeping those inside the 2df border and we confront them with groups identified in a mock catalogue which emulate the 2df geometry . as result , we observe no differences between the distribution of physical properties ( @xmath61,@xmath62 and @xmath63 ) of these samples , showing that the complex geometry of the 2df border do not affect group properties .",
    "another source of bias could be the variation of redshift completeness across the sky producing a wrong estimation of the physical properties in low completeness regions . in order to quantify this possible bias",
    ", we compare the physical properties of both , @xmath53 and @xmath52 mock catalogues described in section 4 , splitting these samples in high and low redshift completeness . in figure",
    "[ fig : comp ] we show the histogram of @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 for low ( @xmath64,upper panels ) and high ( @xmath65,lower panels ) completeness .",
    "dotted lines correspond to @xmath52 mock catalogue whereas the solid lines correspond to @xmath53 one .",
    "as it can be seen , only the virial radius in the low redshift completeness regions show some differences , nevertheless they do not produce any significant effect in the mass estimation .",
    "finally the distribution of the estimated physical properties are shown in figure [ fig : zr ] . in the upper - left panel",
    "we plot the redshift distribution with a mean redshift of @xmath66 , the lower - left panel shows the virial mass distribution , the upper - right panel correspond to the velocity dispersion distribution , and the virial radii distribution is shown in the remainder plot .",
    "the mean values of the 2dfggc are quoted in table 1 .",
    "in this paper we present a new catalogue of galaxy groups derived from the 2dfgrs , the largest sample of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts at the present .",
    "the construction of this catalogue of groups ( 2dfggc ) was carried out introducing some modifications in the friend of friends algorithm developed by huchra & geller ( 1982 ) in order to take into account the different sky coverage variations in the sample .",
    "we have tested these modifications taking advantage of mock catalogues which allow us to explore the space parameter looking for the best values to maximize the group identification accuracy in redshift space . with these parameters ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath57 @xmath69 )",
    "we obtain that @xmath70 of groups in real space match some group with at least four members in redshift space .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath71 of groups in redshift space are spurious ( no matched groups @xmath72 and groups associated with a binary or triplet @xmath73 ) .",
    "we also find that the introduced modifications are able to detect @xmath74 more groups than the obtained by the original huchra & geller algorithm .",
    "additionally , we explore the border effect and a possible bias due to redshift completeness on the physical properties , finding that none of them produce significant effects on the final estimations .    using the optimal identification parameters , the final group sample for the 2df survey comprise 2209 groups of galaxies with mean redshift of @xmath75 and a mean velocity dispersion of @xmath76=261 km / s . from the estimation of the virial masses for the galaxy groups we obtain a mean mass @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath42 @xmath79 with a mean virial radius @xmath80 @xmath81 .",
    "the new galaxy group catalogue is one of the largest groups samples until the present . for this reasons the new sample is more suitable for statistical studies than has been previously available .",
    "we want warmly thank to carlton baugh for reading the manuscript and helpful suggestions .",
    "we also thank to peder norberg and shaun cole for kindly providing the software describing the mask of the 2dfgrs and to the 2dfgrs team for having made available the actual data sets of the sample .",
