    "in the last decade the possibility of a superfluid alkali atom fermi gas has attracted much attention both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite because this phenomenon opens a new opportunity to study strongly correlated quantum many - particle systems and to emulate high - temperature superconductors .",
    "optical lattices are made with lasers , and therefore , the lattice geometry is easy to modify by changing the wavelength of the intersecting laser beams . near the feshbach resonance",
    "the atom - atom interaction can be manipulated in a controllable way because the scattering length @xmath1 can be changed from the bcs side ( negative values ) to the bec side ( positive values ) reaching very large values close to resonance .",
    "we focus our attention on the bcs transition ( negative scattering length ) of degenerate fermionic gases to a superfluid state analogous to superconductivity .",
    "in particular , we consider an equal mixture of @xmath0 atomic fermi gas of two hyperfine states @xmath2 with contact interaction loaded into an optical lattice .",
    "the two hyperfine states are described by pseudospins @xmath3 .",
    "we also assume that the number of atoms in each hyperfine state per site ( the filling factor ) is smaller than unity , and that the lattice potential is sufficiently deep such that the tight - binding approximation is valid .",
    "the system in this case is well described by the single - band hubbard model : @xmath4 here , the fermi operator @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) creates ( destroys ) a fermion on the lattice site @xmath7 with pseudospin @xmath3 and @xmath8 is the density operator on site @xmath7 with a position vector @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the chemical potential , and the symbol @xmath11 means sum over nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "@xmath12 is the tunneling strength of the atoms between nearest - neighbor sites , and @xmath13 is the on - site interaction . on the bcs side",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath13 is negative ( the atomic interaction is attractive ) . for simplicity",
    "we assume that each well of the periodic potential for atomic motion in three dimensions could be approximated by a harmonic potential .",
    "this harmonic approximation gives the following analytical results of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) @xcite : @xmath15,\\quad   u=-\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\frac{|a_s|}{\\lambda } \\left(\\frac{2s^3e^3_r}{m\\lambda^2}\\right)^{1/4}.\\ ] ] here @xmath16 is the laser wavelength , @xmath17 is the lattice height , and @xmath18 is the mass of the trapped @xmath0 atoms .",
    "the recoil energy of the lattice @xmath19 depends on the lattice constant @xmath20 . in our numerical calculations",
    "the wavelength is chosen to be @xmath21 nm ( @xmath22 ev ) @xcite .",
    "the lattice height is assumed to be @xmath23 .    in what follows we study the spectrum of the collective modes of the hamiltonian ( [ hubb1 ] ) . according to the goldstone theorem , the long - wavelength limit of the spectrum has to be linear which means the speed of sound in this limit is independent of the wave - vector . in ref .",
    "[ ] the spectrum of the collective modes has been obtained from the poles of the density response function which had been calculated in the generalized random phase approximation ( grpa ) .",
    "this response - function version of the grpa uses a @xmath24 matrix @xmath25 ( we follow the notations used in ref . [ ] ) which has nine ( not six as it is stated in ref . [ ] ) independent elements : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "the velocity of sound is important because it tells us how fast the sound propagates in the system , but more importantly , it is intimately related to the normal ( phonon ) part of the liquid according to landau s theory of superfluidity @xcite .     of the phonon - like collective mode . for filling factor @xmath65 , lattice height @xmath23 , and scattering length @xmath66 ( @xmath67 is the bohr radius of hydrogen ) ,",

    "momenta the dispersion saturates to @xmath84 . as it is expected , when the interaction between the atoms is increased by increasing the scattering length , the compressibility of the system increases , and therefore , the speed of sound decreases , as can be seen in fig .",
