    "* ) , our line of sight should intercept an outflowing , highly ionized gas .",
    "it is now recognized that many components , differing in ionization level , column density , and outflowing velocity , are actually constituting this outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the bulk of the x - rays are produced here ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the blr is likely to produce x - ray radiation , but up to now this radiation was never convincingly observed in x - ray spectra @xcite .",
    "we processed the -letgs data of  following the approach described in @xcite .",
    "the residuals to a basic continuum model show significant excess emission , especially in the 18 - 24   wavelength range , where the main oxygen line features are (   triplet and   ) .",

    "evidence of weaker broad excesses is found for  and  ( fig .",
    "[ f : best_fit ] ) and possibly neon ( see next paragraph for the modeling ) .",
    "the inclusion of broad emission lines is required to properly fit the absorbed spectrum .",
    "the best fit requires indeed absorption by two components of ionized gas . for the lower ionized component",
    "we find : @xmath0@xmath1 , and log@xmath20.57 , while for the high ionization component the parameters are : n@xmath3@xmath1 and log@xmath22.5 .",
    "the two absorbers seem to belong to systems with different outflow velocity , -220@xmath4 and -570@xmath5 kms@xmath6 for the low and high ionization gas , respectively .",

    "thanks to the simultaneous fuse and hst observation @xcite , we could compare the x - ray line luminosity with the ones measured for the uv broad emission lines .",
    "we used cloudy @xcite for the modeling .",
    "the input ionizing spectral continuum was evaluated directly from the hst , fuse and  data .",

    "two ionization components for the emitting medium are certainly needed in order to explain the uv and the lower ionization x - ray lines ( labeled as  cold \" and  warm \" in fig .",

    "this result is based mainly on the more precise uv measurements .",
    "the higher ionization x - ray lines , such as , , , , and  may require the contribution of a higher ionization component (  hot \" in fig.[f : cloudy ] ) .",
    "the ionization parameters of these components are roughly log@xmath2 -1.5 , 1.6 and 3.6 for the  cold \" ,  warm \" , and  hot \" components , respectively .",
