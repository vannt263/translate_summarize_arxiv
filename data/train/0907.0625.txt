    "ultracold atomic gases provide a perfect playground to study nonlinear atom optics , and nonlinear structures and textures , such as solitons  @xcite .",
    "these studies have led to the observations of dark  @xcite and bright  @xcite solitons in trapped bose - einstein condensates , bright solitons stabilized by the presence of dark ones  @xcite as well as oscillating soliton / vortex ring  @xcite .",
    "the analogy to nonlinear optics  @xcite has triggered theoretical interest in discrete ( lattice ) solitons  @xcite , and has led to the seminal observations of gap solitons , i.e. , lattice solitons with repulsive interactions , but with an appropriate dispersion management  @xcite .",
    "while most of the studies of solitons were concentrated on their classical aspects , more recently , considerable interest has been devoted to the effect of thermal noise  @xcite , quantum properties of solitons , and the role of quantum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the latter may cause filling up of the dark soliton core in the quantum detection process , as was shown using the bogoliubov  de gennes equations  @xcite .",
    "the same method was also employed to study the stability of solitons  @xcite , excitations caused by the trap opening  @xcite , and entanglement generation in collisions of two bright solitons  @xcite .",
    "a noisy version of the standing bright solitons was studied using the exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo method  @xcite .",
    "bright solitons in 1d were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where exact lieb - liniger solutions were used to calculate the internal correlation function of the particles positions . making use of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnse ) , and the time - evolving block decimation algorithm",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that quantum effects cause the soliton to fill in , and that soliton collisions become inelastic  @xcite .",
    "all previous studies of lattice solitons were done in the deep superfluid phase . however , near the phase boundary between superfluid ( sf ) and mott insulator ( mi )  @xcite , the propagation of matter waves becomes strongly suppressed due to the enhancement of quantum fluctuations .",
    "in addition , near the phase transition the superfluidity is determined either by particles , or holes depending on the lattice filling and system parameters  @xcite .",
    "therefore , fundamental questions arise : do the solitons of any form exist in this regime , and , if the answer is yes , what are their properties ?",
    "evidently , the characteristics of such solitons are expected to be very different from the ones in the deep sf regime .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study lattice solitons near the mi - sf phase transition .",
    "we find that , in particular , no soliton solutions exist within the mi regions , and that both standing and propagating solitons exhibit anomalous behavior in the hole sf region . a generalized bogoliubov ",
    "de  gennes stability analysis indicates that the solitons are sensitive to perturbations and thereby break down over longer time periods .",
    "our results are achieved by employing the position - dependent gutzwiller ansatz which gives a satisfactory description of the quantum phases of inhomogeneous bosonic systems  @xcite as well as their dynamical behavior  @xcite .",
    "we note that the same method was recently utilized to study vortices in the vicinity of the mi - sf phase transition  @xcite .",

    "ii we present the model and the gutzwiller method . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss properties of the ground states of the model , obtained using the gutzwiller method , and the nature of the sf phase ( hole sf versus particle sf ) is discussed .",
    "section iv is devoted to the numerical studies of the standing dark solitons ( kinks ) , i.e. , stationary antisymmetric solutions of the time - dependent gutzwiller equations .",
    "we analyze in detail their shape and nature in different regions of the phase diagram . in sec .",
    "v we consider the linear and modulational stabilities of the dark solitons , and show that generically they are unstable , but may have quite long lifetimes .",
    "section vi concerns to the problem of experimental generation of propagating solitons using phase imprinting method .",
    "we identify here the regimes where such generation , and the well - defined soliton propagation is possible .",

    "[ fig3 ] , but here @xmath110 behaves differently .",
    "more precisely , @xmath110 shows a local maximum coinciding with the propagating dip of the occupation numbers , and a local minimum where instead @xmath114 has a local maximum . this anomalous behavior , which is found only within the grey ( green ) regions of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a manifestation of the hole superfluidity , can not be described by the dnse .",

    "[ fig2 ] , the time evolution is qualitatively the same as in fig .",
    "the simulations for @xmath60 on the lattice site and in the middle of two neighboring sites do not show any noticeable difference in the time evolution .    since the difference in the dynamics shows up in the behavior of @xmath64 , it should be possible to observe it in the time - of - flight experiments  @xcite which are based on the measurement of the momentum distribution @xmath115 \\ ; , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath116 is the fourier transform of the wannier function  @xcite . in the gutzwiller approximation",

    "therefore , in order to make more concrete experimental predictions , further investigations beyond the scope of the present work are required . _ in situ _ imaging of ultracold atoms in optical lattices became also possible due to novel techniques  @xcite which allow to measure individual site occupations @xmath17 as well .",

    "@xmath93 is the dimensionless time.,width=302 ]    we also performed simulations with other values of the width @xmath104 and did not find any strong influence on the propagation velocity .",
    "larger values of @xmath104 result in broader propagating modes and their shapes become more smooth .",
    "however , we did find that the interference pattern between the modes propagating in the opposite directions , visible in the center of figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] ,  [ fig4 ] ,  [ fig5 ] , becomes suppressed for larger @xmath104 .",
    "finally , the soliton velocity @xmath120 as well as the velocity of the density wave @xmath121 as functions of @xmath109 are shown in fig .",
    "they are calculated making use of a linear fit of the corresponding minimum and maximum of @xmath122 for the dimensionless time @xmath123 .",
    "although the dependences are very weak , it is found that the velocities are not monotonic showing a maximum for @xmath124 .",
    "this behavior is different from what was found in the simulations based on the gross - pitaevskii equation in continuum in a harmonic trap  @xcite or in a periodic potential  @xcite . on the other hand , for increasing soliton velocity , the depth of the propagating dip as well as the height of its maxima decreases .",
    "the same was found in continuum model  @xcite .",
    "however , in the continuum model , where analytical expressions for moving grey soliton solutions are known , it directly follows that in proper units the square of the soliton depth plus the square of the soliton velocity is a constant , i.e. increasing the velocity makes the soliton more shallow  @xcite .",
    "the present analysis differs in several aspects from the continuum one ; the solitons are propagating within a lattice , we consider dynamics beyond the regular mean - field , and the studied moving solitons are not time - dependent solutions of the system hamiltonian but rather phase imprinted soliton - like states .",
    "thereby , not surprisingly , we have numerically found that the same velocity - depth relation does not hold in our situation . in particular ,",
    "our results indicate that for small - to - moderate imprinting amplitudes @xmath109 ( as in fig .",

    "we have investigated dark solitons of bosons in optical lattices at zero temperature . using the gutzwiller ansatz , we found kink stationary states where the condensate order parameter @xmath64 is an antisymmetric function with respect to some spatial point .",
    "however , in certain regions close to the mi - sf transition which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the corresponding @xmath73 does not have a global minimum at the point where @xmath64 vanishes .",
    "this anomalous behavior shows up near the phase boundary where one has to distinguish between particle and hole superfluidity . in general",
    ", we have found three types of stationary states : solitons of particles , solitons of holes and a mixture of both .",

    "the real - time dynamics of the propagating dark solitons created by the phase imprinting is studied as well . in the mi phase ,",
    "the solitons can not be created .",
    "this can be done only in the sf phase , where there are always global minima and maxima of @xmath73 propagating in the opposite directions and these directions are always the same .",
