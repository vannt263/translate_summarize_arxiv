    "while much progress has been made recently in the field of quantum impurity problems , it is still an open challenge to fully understand the phase diagram for a single ( charge ) impurity in a one dimensional quantum wire , where the electrons are described by a luttinger liquid with charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the problem was studied using the renormalisation group and perturbation theory by kane and fisher @xcite and furusaki and nagasoa @xcite .",
    "a complete picture of the flows generated by the rg was obtained in terms of the  @xmath5 \" factors , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , describing the interaction of bulk charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the existence of tentalizing new fixed points , which would be partly transmitting and partly reflecting , was in particular conjectured .",
    "while steps were taken to identify these fixed points using conformal field theory @xcite , the determination of their exact nature - in particular the computation of the universal associated conductances - remains open .    in this paper , we are addressing this impurity problem from the point of view of integrability .",
    "a simpler problem , the case of an impurity in a spinless electron gas , was mapped on the boundary sine - gordon model @xcite , which is a completely integrable quantum field theory @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the problem of electrons with spin and impurity , it maps after bosonization and the same folding maneuvers as @xcite on a `` double sine - gordon model '' , with two coupling constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( related simply to @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "unfortunately , this model does not seem to be generically integrable .",
    "there are however special integrable manifolds . in the first part of this work @xcite the case @xmath0",
    "was solved by using a slightly different theory than the double sine - gordon model , with however the same boundary interaction . here a more direct route is adopted and we investigate the integrability of the ",
    "double sine - gordon models \" .",
    "the simplest one is given by @xmath1 , and can be considered as a particular case of a new integrable model recently discovered by fateev @xcite .",
    "this integrable manifold is , a priori , not the most interesting , since it lies far away from the region where the new ir fixed points are conjectured to arise .",
    "however , a closer study along the lines of @xcite gives rise to very intriguing results . by a variety of arguments , including the computation of the non equilibrium tunneling current at vanishing temperature",
    ", we found that the ir fixed point does * not * correspond to two separate leads ( `` open '' fixed point @xcite ) , as suggested by a ( maybe too naive ) analysis of the classical action @xcite .",
    "it is not completely clear to us what this ir fixed point is .",
    "although it corresponds to complete reflection ( vanishing transmitted current ) for spin and charge , the operators along which it is approached seem to correspond to collective excitations that would be impossible for separate leads : the leading operators describe actually either transfer of one electron charge but no spin , or one spin @xmath4 but no charge !",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is a brief summary of the field theoretic description of the problem and of the folding of @xcite .",
    "section 3 studies the `` double sine - gordon model '' in full generality .",
    "the integrable manifold is studied using the technique of non local conserved currents of @xcite , and s and r matrices are obtained .",
    "the ir fixed point is ( partially ) identified and shown to differ from the expected one . in section 4 ,",
    "the out of equilibrium current with an external potential is computed exactly .",
    "section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "many additional technical details are given in appendices . in appendix",
    "a , we explain why the model , although quantum integrable , is presumably not classically integrable .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the case of the ordinary sine - gordon model , and suggests that semi classical arguments as in @xcite are maybe not reliable .",
    "appendix b discusses the problem of quantum boundary integrability . in appendix c , a perturbative computation of the s matrix around the free fermion point",
    "is presented , which confirms our non perturbative identification based on non local currents .",
    "appendix d is a first order keldysh computation that fixes the relation between the bare coupling in our action and the parameter @xmath10 of the r matrix .",
    "appendix e sketches the computation of the whole two point current correlator using form - factors , which allows a more complete identification of the operator content of the ir fixed point .",
    "in order to fix notations and the problem , let us repeat some of the definitions in @xcite . in the one dimensional luttinger liquid , bosonisation of the fermionic operators",
    "is accomplished via @xmath11 } e^{i\\sqrt{\\pi } \\phi_\\mu(x)},\\ ] ] with @xmath12 .",

    "changing basis to the charge and spin degrees of freedom @xmath17 we obtain the action @xmath18 + \\frac{1}{2g_\\sigma } [ ( \\partial_x\\theta_\\sigma)^2 + ( \\partial_y\\theta_\\sigma)^2 ] .",

    "the spin and charge velocities have been normalised such that @xmath20 . in this convention ,",
    "the g - factors have value @xmath21 for a non - interacting system .",
    "the electric and magnetic conductances of this system follow directly from kubo s formula @xmath22 as discussed in @xcite , this formula is actually not correct for the charge conductance , because of the way the system is coupled to the reservoirs .",
    "one rather has @xmath23 for any @xmath6 . in this paper",
    ", we compute the conductance as in @xcite to make comparison with the results of this paper more straightforward .",
    "the correct physical results follow by simple rescaling .",
    "we are interested in the physical properties of this model in the presence of a charge impurity at the origin @xmath24 . due to this impurity",
    ", the hamiltonian gets an additional piece @xmath25 here @xmath26 is a potential which has essentially zero measure outside @xmath24 and under the bosonisation rules sketched at the beginning , this leads to the change of action @xmath27 where @xmath28 . in general , all terms consistent with the symmetries of the action must be considered at the boundary since they will be generated by renormalization .",
    "this means that the most general form of the perturbation is @xmath29 where the @xmath30 s are real couplings .",
    "the renormalisation group equations read at first order @xmath31 in this paper , for reasons given later , we will restrict to the manifold @xmath32 so that only the perturbation with @xmath33 is relevant . in the following",
    "we denote @xmath34 by @xmath30 .    in @xcite , the equivalent problem for spinless electrons",
    "was exactly solved .",
    "the solution required a folding to transform the impurity problem into a boundary problem , and then used recent results on boundary integrable quantum field theories @xcite together with the massless scattering approach .",
    "the same folding can easily be acomplished in the problem with spin .",
    "first , it is convenient to rescale the fields , writing the action as @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then introduce odd and even fields @xmath36 \\\\ \\theta^o_\\mu&=&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } [ \\theta_{\\mu , l}(x , y ) -\\theta_{\\mu , r } ( -x , y ) ] .",

    "the odd fields , having dirichlet boundary conditions , completely decouple and do not interact . in the previous form , the even field is left moving and we can  fold \" using @xmath37 and now expressing everything in terms of the fields @xmath38 which is defined on the negative axis , we get the action @xmath39+\\lambda \\int dy \\cos\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi g_\\rho}{2 } } \\theta_\\rho ( 0 ) \\cos\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi g_\\sigma}{2}}\\theta_\\sigma ( 0 ) .",
    "\\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the next step in @xcite was to use the integrability of the corresponding boundary quantum field theory - the boundary sine - gordon model ( bsg ) . in the present case with spin ,",
    "the problem , involving two fields , is more complicated , and very few results are available .",
    "we must first investigate in more details this `` double sine - gordon model '' ( dsg ) and its boundary counterpart ( bdsg ) .",
    "the following section , together with a series of appendices , are devoted to that study .",
    "the reader interested in physical properties only can go directly to the end of next section .",
    "although the problem at hand involves an interaction only at the boundary , it is crucial - like for the ordinary sine - gordon model @xcite - to understand first the model with a bulk interaction .",
    "we start thus with the general action for the double sine - gordon model , with two fields @xmath40 @xmath41 a more general form of this action was first investigated in @xcite , where an integrable manifold was identified , of which our model is a subset . the following arguments , in particular the use of affine quantum group symmetries , are ours , but were strongly influenced by the results of @xcite .",
    "the double cosine term ( the perturbation ) has dimension @xmath42 .",
    "the free propagators are @xmath43 , where we set @xmath44 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not expect the model to be integrable for any choice of the coupling constants @xmath45 .",
    "a useful strategy to identify quantum integrable varieties is to look for non - local conserved currents , following bernard and leclair @xcite .",
    "a current @xmath46 will be conserved if it is local with respect to the perturbation , and if the residue of the simple pole in the short distance expansion of @xmath47 and the perturbation is a total derivative . by trial and error ,",
    "the simplest possible candidates have the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 are the chiral and antichiral components of the field , and in ( [ currents ] ) , @xmath50 .",
    "one has for instance ( exponentials are implicitely normal ordered ) @xmath51}={1\\over z - w } e^{i[\\beta_1\\varphi_1(w)+\\beta_2\\varphi_2(w)- { 4\\pi\\over\\beta_2}\\varphi_2(z)]}\\left [ -{i\\beta_1\\over 4\\pi ( z - w)}+\\partial\\varphi_1\\right]\\ ] ] so the simple pole has residue @xmath52}.\\ ] ] this is a total derivative iff @xmath53 or @xmath54 in that case , the perturbation has physical dimension @xmath55 . )",
    "does not , however , correspond to free fermions except when @xmath56 . ] setting @xmath57 the currents give rise to conserved charges @xmath58 by counting arguments , following @xcite , one expects that the conservation extends to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "in addition , we of course have two conserved topological charges , not @xmath59 as in the sine - gordon model . ]",
    "@xmath60 the invariance of the action constrains @xmath61 and @xmath62 to have the same parity .    following the construction of @xcite , one checks that the non local conserved charges generate the quantum affine algebras @xmath63 , with @xmath64 moreover",
    ", one also checks that charges of different type @xmath50 commute .",
    "for instance , one has @xmath65\\left[{i\\over\\beta_2(z - w)}+\\partial\\varphi_2\\right ] e^{i{4\\pi\\over\\beta_2}\\varphi_2 ( z)}e^{-i{4\\pi\\over\\beta_1}\\varphi_1(w)}\\ ] ] so the simple pole has residue @xmath66 e^{4i\\pi[{\\varphi_2\\over\\beta_2}- { \\varphi_1\\over\\beta_1 } ] } \\ ] ] which is a total derivative on the manifold ( [ cond ] ) .",
    "again , while the commutation relations are established to first order in perturbation theory , simple scaling arguments show that they hold to any order .",
    "we conclude that , to any order in perturbation , the theory exhibits the symmetry @xmath67 .    under the condition ( [ cond ] ) ,",
    "it is lengthy but straightforward to show the existence of non trivial local conserved quantities ( this has first been shown in @xcite ) . besides the stress energy tensor ,",
    "the next non trivial one has dimension 4 , and follows from @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the existence of this non trivial conserved quantity is expected to be enough , following standard arguments @xcite to guarantee quantum integrability .",
    "we can make an easy guess for the particle excitations and the factorized s matrix .",
    "commutation with the two quantum affine algebras independently dictates a tensor product structure .",
    "moreover , since @xmath71 must always have the same parity , excitations should be massive particles carrying a * pair * of quantum numbers @xmath71 : ie they are simultaneously solitons of the field @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "one then obtains as the simplest choice @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the s - matrix of solitons for the ordinary sine - gordon model at coupling @xmath76 , @xmath77 and we used the results of @xcite .",
    "this scattering matrix was first found in @xcite using a different argument .",
    "it is important to stress that we do not have independently solitons of the field @xmath72 and of the field @xmath73 , but composite objects .",
    "also , the coupling in the s - matrices is renormalized non trivially .",
    "this is largely the consequence of the @xmath78 term appearing in the conserved currents , a feature which is not there in the standard sine - gordon model , but is necessary here because the interaction is the product of two cosines : although the s - matrix is factorized , the theory is thus highly interacting .",
    "it is interesting to discuss the action and the factorized s matrix ( [ ssmatrix ] ) from the point of view of a fermion theory : see appendix c for more details .",
    "some special points can be identified on the integrable manifold , which can be solved independently .",
    "for instance the case @xmath79 can be recast , by forming linear combinations of the fields , into a problem of two decoupled sine - gordon theories at their free fermion point , in agreement with ( [ ssmatrix ] ) .",
    "the case @xmath80 is also trivially solvable , and equivalent to one free boson and one sine - gordon model at the free fermion point .",
    "this is a very different description from the one provided by ( [ ssmatrix ] ) , which involves in particular a sine - gordon s matrix at the point @xmath81 , ie the @xmath82 supersymmetric point .",
    "nevertheless , we will check that , when physical quantities are computed , they have identical expressions in both descriptions .    from the relation @xmath83= \\delta_{ij}{\\beta_i\\over 2\\pi}(\\alpha-\\bar{\\alpha } )   e^{i(\\alpha\\varphi_j+\\bar{\\alpha}\\bar{\\varphi}_j)},\\ ] ] we find the soliton operators ( up to polynomials in derivatives of @xmath84 ) @xmath85\\nonumber \\\\ \\bar{\\psi}_i^\\pm=&\\exp\\left[\\mp i{2\\pi\\over\\beta_i}\\bar{\\varphi}_i\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which have topological charge @xmath86 .",
    "the local current @xmath87 is a raising ( lowering ) operator for particles of type @xmath88 : it annihilates solitons ( antisolitons ) and transforms antisolitons ( solitons ) into solitons ( antisolitons ) . @xmath87",
    "conserves @xmath89 , @xmath50 .",
    "the main step in @xcite was to use the integrability of the boundary sine - gordon model .",
    "here , one can easily prove that the model ( [ bulkact ] ) defined on the half line @xmath90 $ ] with a boundary interaction at @xmath24 @xmath91 is integrable for any choice @xmath92 .",
    "this model we call the double boundary sine - gordon model ( dbsg ) . in the factorized scattering picture ,",
    "the boundary interaction is described by a reflection matrix solution of the boundary yang baxter equation .",
    "the factorized structure of the bulk s - matrix leads to the immediate conjecture for this reflection matrix @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the reflection matrix of the boundary sine - gordon model given explicitely in @xcite .",
    "of course the original kane - fisher impurity problem is massless in the bulk . as in the spinless case",
    ", we describe this problem starting from the massive theory with a bulk coupling ( [ bulkact ] ) by using the quasiparticles basis , and letting @xmath95 . in that limit",
    ", we get right and left moving massless solitons with dispersion relation @xmath96 , with @xmath38 the rapidity . movers of opposite types interact via a constant s - matrix , while movers of the same type still interact with ( [ ssmatrix ] ) . in addition , r movers bounce back as l movers at the boundary .",
    "we recall in particular the physical amplitudes @xmath97 here , @xmath10 is an energy scale related with the coupling @xmath30 by @xmath98 , where we used ( [ cond ] ) .    already at this point , the identification of these amplitudes allows a rough analysis of the infrared fixed point . if we expand the modulus square of the r - matrices in terms of the inverse coupling we find that @xmath99 expands in powers of @xmath100 .",
    "on the other hand , by the fermi golden rule , these are proportional to the square of the matrix elements of the operators perturbing the ir fixed point .",
    "we thus see that these operators must have dimension @xmath101 the same result is obtained when analyzing physical properties ( see below ) .    this conclusion is , a priori , very surprising .",
    "indeed , the standard analysis @xcite of the ir limit based on the classical action ( [ bdract ] ) would suggest that , at large coupling , the fields @xmath102 are located at the bottom of the boundary potentials , leading to dirichlet boundary conditions with @xmath103 this fixed point we refer to in the following as the standard ir fixed point . with ( [ diri ] ) ,",
    "it is easy to classify the allowed operators describing the approach to the standard ir fixed point .",
    "one simply computes the partition function of the model with these boundary conditions at @xmath104 , and matches with the formula of conformal invariant field theories , @xmath105 .",
    "here , one finds @xmath106 where the primed sum indicates that @xmath107 have the same parity , @xmath108 .",
    "the dimensions of the allowed operators , up to integers , are thus of the form @xmath109 in particular , the lowest dimension operators have dimension @xmath110 .",
    "remarkably , the ones with @xmath111 are not there !",
    "there are several explanations for this discrepancy .",
    "the first , of course , is the possibility that our s and r matrices have not been correctly identified .",
    "the previous arguments about affine quantum group symmetries are however usually considered to be quite strong .",
    "they can be made even stronger at some special points with @xmath82 supersymmetry ( see below ) .",
    "moreover , physical results for all limiting cases where the solutions is known by other means will be reproduced correctly ( see also below ) .",
    "finally , the s and r matrices also agree with perturbation theory around the free fermion point @xmath56 ( see appendix c ) .",
    "if we do believe these s and r matrices , another possible explanation is that the perturbation around the ir fixed point has a vanishing radius of convergence , so the expansion of ( [ ampl ] ) ( or other physical quantity ) in powers of @xmath10 is the result of a resummation , and can not be used to naively identify the dimension of the perturbing operator .",
    "such phenomenon has been observed in other integrable models @xcite .",
    "we suspect however that this discrepancy arises , more simply , because the ir fixed point obtained by naive analysis of the action is not the correct one . to justify this , we recall first that integrable flows are usually found to be integrable considered either as perturbations of the uv or of the ir fixed point , and with the same set of conserved quantities . for instance , in the boundary sine - gordon model perturbed by @xmath112 , the local conserved quantities like @xmath113 commute not only with the perturbation , but also with its `` dual '' @xmath114 . as a result ,",
    "the flow near the ir fixed point , which is approached along this dual field plus local integrals of motion @xmath115 , is integrable too . in the present case",
    ", we checked that our @xmath113 quantity does commute , besides @xmath116 , with the currents @xmath87 , but * not * with @xmath117 , nor with @xmath118 . as a result",
    ", it seems impossible to flow to the disconnected fixed point , since its approach would not be integrable . on the other hand ,",
    "the ir fixed point described above was found to be approached along operators of the same dimension as @xmath87 .",
    "very presumably , it is approached along these operators indeed ( plus the @xmath115 ) , providing an integrable flow .    as another piece of justification , it is useful to consider a generalization of ( [ bulkact ] ) given by the action @xmath119 + { \\lambda\\over 2}\\int",
    "dx dy \\left [ e^{\\beta\\phi}\\cos(\\beta_1\\phi_1+\\beta_2\\phi_2)+e^{-\\beta\\phi } \\cos(\\beta_1\\phi_1-\\beta_2\\phi_2)\\right ] \\label{newact}\\ ] ] involving thus one more bosonic field .",
    "non local conserved currents generalizing ( [ currents ] ) can be built @xmath120 provided the condition @xmath121 holds . by the same arguments ,",
    "the model is integrable .",
    "an integrable boundary action follows @xmath122 . \\label{newbdact}\\ ] ] it is possible to compute the algebra generated by the conserved charges and it is found to be the same as in the previous model .",
    "thus , the s and r matrices for this model are essentially the same as the ones for the previous , simpler model with @xmath123 , with however the the new condition ( [ newcond ] ) .",
    "the ir fixed point deduced from the classical action is the `` standard '' one like for @xmath123 since the field @xmath124 can not be compactified .",
    "this generalization is useful because at the value @xmath125 , the model ( [ newact ] ) coincides with the bosonized form of the @xmath82 supersymmetric sine - gordon model , as can easily be inferred from the fact that the @xmath126 currents have dimension @xmath127 : @xmath128 .",
    "the bulk perturbation is unitary and preserves supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the same is true for the boundary perturbation .",
    "this supersymmetry is a particular case of the quantum affine symmetry generated by the currents @xmath87 .",
    "the preservation of supersymmetry is a more firmly based property than the preservation of quantum affine symmetries however , because the generators are local .",
    "we now use the conservation of supersymmetry to justify the identification of the ir fixed point provided by the s and r matrices .",
    "let us first recall what happens for the supersymmetric point of the ordinary boundary sine - gordon model first @xcite . then , @xmath129 . the perturbing operator @xmath112 in the uv has boundary dimension @xmath130 corresponding to the superpartner of the chiral primary field @xmath131 , and preserves supersymmetry .",
    "the ir fixed point is , in that case , correctly reproduced by the standard analysis of the classical action .",
    "the dirichlet boundary conditions analogous to ( [ diri ] ) give rise to the partition function @xmath132 which is the neveu schwartz character of the identity ( that one is in the ns sector follows immediately from the fact that boundary conditions are the same on both ends of the cylinder ) .",
    "the ir fixed point is approached along the operator @xmath133 of dimension @xmath134 , ie along the operators @xmath135 .",
    "this is very natural from a landau ginzburg point of view : near the minima of the potential , the effective potential is @xmath136 with no left - over chiral primary field in the spectrum beside the identity .",
    "the approach has thus to be along a descendent of the identity , with @xmath135 as the natural candidates .",
    "it is not totally obvious a priori that a perturbation along @xmath135 preserves supersymmetry ; while @xmath137 anticommutes with @xmath137 , the anticommutator of @xmath137 and @xmath138 is non zero .",
    "however , the @xmath135 are fermionic operators ; to have a bosonic ir action , they must thus be coupled to some fermionic boundary degrees of freedom , and these allow the restoration of supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "we can now get back to the model ( [ newbdact ] ) when @xmath125 , ie with unbroken @xmath82 supersymmetry .",
    "it is easy to check that the standard ir fixed point ( [ diri ] ) can not be approached while preserving supersymmetry .",
    "on the other hand , the leading operators describing the approach to our new ir fixed point have dimensions @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the first one corresponds to @xmath141 , and , like for the ordinary sine - gordon model , it does preserve supersymmetry after addition of fermionic boundary degrees of freedom .",
    "the second one corresponds to @xmath142 . because the two affine quantum algebras in the problem commute",
    ", it too does preserve supersymmetry .",
    "hence , our fixed point is perfectly compatible with unbroken supersymmetry , while the standard one is not .",
    "away from the supersymmetric points , a similar argument can be made based on the conservation of affine quantum symmetries instead .. it is however possible for special values of @xmath143 @xcite . ]",
    "it leads right away to the claim that the ir fixed point should be approached along the non local conserved currents : @xmath144 in the ordinary sine - gordon case , as is well known , and along @xmath87 , of dimensions @xmath145 , in the double sine - gordon case , in agreement with the conjectured s and r matrices .",
    "based on the analysis of physical properties ( see below and appendix e ) , we conjecture that the operator content of the ir fixed point is a * subset * of the spectrum encoded in @xmath146 note that the partition function ( [ conji ] ) would correspond to a model with dirichlet boundary conditions of the type ( [ diri ] ) but with no coupling between @xmath147 and @xmath148 . a possible conjecture for the ratio of boundary entropies in the uv and ir is @xmath149 while the same ratio for the standard fixed point would read @xmath150 .",
    "if this result is correct , our new fixed point is less stable than the open ( separate leads ) one : therefore , it might well be that it is reached only with the uv action ( [ chagact ] ) on the integrable manifold @xmath1 .",
    "the question of course remains : why is the identification of the ir fixed point misleading in our case , while it was not for the boundary sine - gordon model ? we have no satisfactory answer to that question at the present time .",
    "but there is an interesting indication : in sharp distinction with the ordinary sine - gordon model , the double sine - gordon model ( [ bulkact ] ) seems to not be integrable classically , as discussed in the appendix a. integrability in the present case is thus a truly quantum property .",
    "since integrability is also responsible ( via the analysis of non local conserved currents and the resulting s and r matrices ) of the unexpected nature of the ir fixed point , it is maybe not so surprising that this ir fixed point can not be obtained from a classical analysis of the action , and thus differs from the standard one .",
    "we can now get back to the physical problem .",
    "a comparison of ( [ bdaction ] ) with the results of this section leads to the identification of the integrable manifold in terms of the @xmath5-factors : @xmath1 .",
    "the postulated exact @xmath151-matrix has the form of a tensor product of spin and charge degrees of freedom @xmath152 with @xmath153 the @xmath151-matrices of a sine - gordon model with parameters @xmath154 .",
    "similarly the boundary reflection matrix is given by @xmath155 the elementary excitations of the folded theory are quasiparticles carrying a charge number @xmath156 ( in units where @xmath157 ) and a spin number @xmath158 ( in units where a physical electron has @xmath159 ) .",
    "here , we have set @xmath160    having a complete description of the kinematics of the model , we can now compute physical properties .",
    "we will restrict to the @xmath161 case here .",
    "extensions to finite @xmath162 are in principle possible , but quite technical .",
    "we will exactly follow the same line of argument as in @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticles are considered as a gas interacting through factorized scattering .",
    "standard thermodynamics arguments can be applied , in the presence of electric and magnetic chemical potentials , to compute the densities and the filling fractions of these quasiparticles .",
    "these are expressed via the thermodynamic bethe ansatz . having these densities , a rate equation",
    "can then be written to compute the contribution to the conductances of the current backscattered by the impurity .",
    "we only consider the case of an external voltage , so the quasiparticles have chemical potential @xmath163 , @xmath162 the temperature . at @xmath161 , a fermi sea is formed , consisting of positively charged quasi - particles , with either spin up or down .",
    "these quasiparticles carry charge labels @xmath164 and @xmath165 . due to the factorized form of the s matrix",
    ", the scattering of these quasiparticles is factorized into the scattering of the first and second labels .",
    "the first labels scatter diagonally with the element @xmath166 . the second labels in general scatter non diagonally",
    ". they would scatter diagonally if @xmath7 was of the form @xmath167 , but then bound states ( carrying a non vanishing electrical charge ) would have to be taken into account .",
    "it is in fact simpler to analyze the more general case corresponding to model ( [ newact ] ) , taking @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 integers .",
