    "studying the dependence of the partition function on deformation parameters is important because the more deformation parameters provided , the finer the information of the theory .",
    "the partition function is given in the integral form@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the expectation value of the adjoint scalar fields in vector multiplets , which parametrizes the flat directions .",
    "the integral is performed over the cartan algebra of the gauge group . in the most general form of the partition function , it depends on the weyl weight of chiral multiplets , real mass parameters , fi parameters , chern - simons levels , and a squashing parameter of the @xmath4 .",
    "fi parameters and chern - simons levels enter in the partition function through the classical action @xmath7 .",
    "the real mass parameters enters through the one - loop determinant of chiral multiplets , and can be introduced as expectation values of scalar fields in external vector multiplets coupling to flavor currents .",

    "they computed the @xmath4 partition function for such theories with the expectation that they may obtain a result depending on the squashing parameter in a non - trivial way .",
    "the result was rather disappointing .",
    "it was turned out that the partition function is identical to that on the round sphere up to some variable changes .",

    "although the metric of the squashed sphere is the same as that of the @xmath1 symmetric squashing in @xcite , the supersymmetry group is different .",
    "we computed the partition function by using localization , and showed that it depends on the squashing parameter in a non - trivial way .",

    "we considered a class of quiver gauge theories studied in @xcite , whose partition function on round @xmath4 scales as @xmath3 .",
    "we confirmed that the free energy on squashed @xmath4 is proportional to @xmath3 as well , and the @xmath20 dependence is factored out as the additional factor @xmath393 regardless of the detailed structure of the theory .",
