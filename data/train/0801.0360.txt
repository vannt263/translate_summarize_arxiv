    "nonextensive thermostatistics @xcite have been utilized with success in connection with a number of problems both in the classical @xcite and the quantum regimes @xcite .",
    "they are thought to be relevant for the study ( among others ) of : systems described by non linear fokker - planck equations @xcite ; systems with a scale - invariant occupancy of phase space @xcite ; non equilibrium scenarios involving temperature fluctuations @xcite ; systems exhibiting weak chaos @xcite ; and systems with interactions of long range relative to the system s size @xcite .",
    "recently hagedorn@xcite statistical theory of the momentum spectra produced in heavy ion collisions has been generalized using tsallis statistics to provide a good description of _ @xmath3 _",
    "annihilation experiments@xcite .",
    "furthermore , walton and rafelski@xcite studied a fokker - planck equation describing charmed quarks in a thermal quark - gluon plasma and showed that tsallis statistics were relevant .",
    "these results suggest that perhaps boltzmann - gibbs statistics may not necessarily be adequate in the quark - gluon phase .",
    "the existence in qcd of single gluon exchange between quarks of different color generates an attractive interaction in the color - antitriplet channel@xcite which leads unavoidably to the occurrence of a particle - particle condensate@xcite or color superconductivity in dense quark matter at low temperatures .",
    "color superconductivity differs from normal superconductivity which is described by bcs - like theories which usually assumes an interaction which is heavily screened . for a point - like four fermion coupling there is no correlation between the initial and outgoing momenta of the interacting fermions .",
    "hence the bcs gap is constant with respect to the momentum as long as the momenta are near the fermi surface . in qcd",
    ", however , scattering of quarks through single gluon exchange exhibits a logarithmic divergence for forward scattering . as a result",
    "the gap is not an exponential in @xmath4 , where g is the coupling constant for qcd , as in bcs but only in @xmath5@xcite .",
    "hence the gap is no longer constant as function of the momentum , even around the fermi surface .",
    "the logarithmic divergence arises because the static magnetic interactions are not screened in dense quark matter at low temperatures .",
    "the absence of a fully screened interaction in color superconductivity suggests that perhaps it might be useful to examine the role that the choice of statistics plays in this phenomenon .",
    "we therefore have solved the gap equations using the generalized thermostatistics of tsallis@xcite rather than that of boltzmann gibbs . in the limit where tsallis parameter goes to one",
    "we recover the boltzmann gibbs results .",
    "we show that the universality condition , which characterizes bcs - like superconductivity , is easily generalized if tsallis statistics are used .",
    "furthermore , calculation of the specific heat as a function of the tsallis parameter suggest that as the parameter increases s - wave color superconductors may behave more like high @xmath2 superconductors than weak superconductors .",
    "rischke and pisarski ( rp)have developed a formalism for the study of color superconductors in the weak coupling regime .",
    "this formalism is valid for systems involving large quark densities and low temperatures@xcite .",
    "one advantage of this formalism is that the temperature dependence of the gap equation is completely transparent . as we will discuss , it is the temperature dependence of the gap equation that is modified when one introduces tsallis statistics .    in general two fundamental color triplet states can pair up into a symmetric color sextet and an antisymmetric color antitriplet .",
    "the antitriplet channel of quark scattering is attractive and leads to the color condensate .",
    "it is well known that these condensates can not form a color singlet .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 is broken in this phase . from a single quark flavor",
    "one can not form a color antitriplet .",
    "the simplest possibility then , and the one we will focus on , is the case of two quark flavors forming a j=0 condensate .",
    "this is the so - called 2sc phase .    in the rp formalism",
    "the gap equation is derived in momentum space using the hard dense loop ( hdl ) approximation . in the hdl approximation",
    "the gluon propagator receives a mass @xmath7 where g is the qcd coupling and @xmath8 is the quark chemical potential .",
    "this approximation generates a hierarchy of scales @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gap at temperature t=0 . in this approximation",
    "the gap equation is    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a cutoff scale , and @xmath14 is the quasiparticle excitation energy .",
    "this integral equation can be turned into a soft integral by the approximation @xmath15    note that the resulting energy gap is a function of momentum k. this is different from bcs superconductors and is due to the long range nature of the color magnetic interaction .",
    "following rp we introduce @xmath16 and change variables to @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this yields the following form for the soft integral equation :    @xmath20 .",
    "\\label{eq : soft2}\\ ] ]    for t=0 this equation can be solved algebraically to give @xmath21 at lowest order in @xmath22@xcite .    at nonzero temperature",
    "the gap equation must be solved numerically .",
    "numerical solutions of eqs.([eq : soft ] ) and ( [ eq : soft2 ] ) for the 2sc model have been studied extensively by zakout _ et .",
    "zakout _ et . al .",
    "_ obtained numerical solutions for the full gap equation ( for a large coupling , @xmath23 ) as well as the approximate ( eq.([eq : soft ] ) ) and soft integral ( eq.([eq : soft2 ] ) ) forms for the gap for small values of g. comparing to the the full gap equation , it was shown that the approximations were valid to leading order .",
    "the gap equation has a sharp peak at the fermi surface , i.e. at @xmath24 in the weak coupling regime .",
    "zakout _ et . al .",
    "_ found that it was essential to use the soft integral form of the gap , eq.([eq : soft2 ] ) , in order to properly secure the singularity .",
    "for the gap equation obtained using tsallis statistics , our numerical calculations lead us to the same conclusion .",
    "to determine the critical temperature , @xmath25 , one assumes @xmath26 where @xmath10 is the gap at t=0 . with this assumption",
    "the gap equation at the fermi surface becomes @xmath27 rs have shown that this yields the standard bcs universality result@xcite @xmath28 one important issue that we address in the following section is whether universality can be maintained using tsallis statistics .",
    "we now investigate the effect on the gap equation from introducing generalized tsallis statistics .",
    "the starting point is the non - extensive entropy proposed by tsallis :      where w is the total number of microstates , p is the associated probabilities , and q is a real number . by taking @xmath30 one recovers the usual boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) expression for entropy .",
    "this results in a modification of the usual fermi - dirac distribution . working in units where k = c=@xmath31=1 the generalized fermi distribution becomes @xmath32^{\\frac{1}{q-1}}+1}. \\label{eq : fermi}\\ ] ] this results in a modification of the temperature dependence of eq.([eq : soft2 ] ) . in eq.([eq : soft2 ] ) the usual bg expression for the distribution function has already been assumed . replacing the usual fermi distribution with eq.([eq : fermi ] )",
    "leads to the following modification in the gap equation : @xmath33 as discussed earlier it is essential to use the soft integral approximation when numerically solving the gap equation in the weak coupling regime .",
    "the generalized gap equation is therefore @xmath34 for g we use the running coupling relation @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the numbers of quark colors and flavors respectively , and @xmath39mev . for the integration cutoff",
    "we take @xmath40 where @xmath41 in the regime we are considering the temperature dependence of eq.([eq : mg ] ) may be ignored .",
    "clearly , the universality condition in its canonical form will not hold since @xmath25 is now a function of q. however , as has already been noted in the case of high @xmath42 bcs superconductors , there is a reasonable generalization of the universality condition@xcite : @xmath43    setting @xmath44 in eq.([eq : tsallistc ] ) and taking @xmath45 we numerically solve the gap equation for @xmath25 for different values of q. fig.[fig1 ] shows both @xmath46 and @xmath47 as a function of q. for reasonable values of q the generalized universality condition shows no appreciable deviation from 3.52 .",
    "it is also possible that a better fit could be obtained by replacing q with some function of q.      we next consider the temperature dependence of the gap equation eq.([eq : tsallistc ] ) . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the gap is a function of the quasiparticle momentum k. in order to get quantitative results we evaluate the gap equation at the fermi surface , @xmath24 .",
    "although q can in principle be any real number , applications of tsallis statistics typically suggest a q value not significantly greater than 1 . fig .",

    "q is determined by fixing the ratio @xmath48 .      for q=1.178 ,",
    "@xmath50 closely resembles the usual behavior of the gap , while increasing q results in a flatter curve . by measuring the temperature dependence of the gap for superconducting quark matter one would clearly be able to differentiate the cases of tsallis and boltzmann - gibbs statistics",
