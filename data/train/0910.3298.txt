    "current interest in charge - spin conversion effects is spurred by challenging prospects of spintronics .",
    "most of the mechanisms of such a conversion are related to the interconnection between electrical and spin current due to spin - orbit interaction , @xcite which results in spin accumulation near the sample edges .",
    "such an accumulation in three- and two - dimensional electron gas in elemental and iii - v semiconductors may result in a spin - hall effect @xcite and positive magnetoresistance .",
    "@xcite it was argued also that the rashba - type spin - orbit interaction in a quantum dot assists pure spin current by modulation of the voltages applied to the leads in a three - terminal device .",
    "@xcite spin coulomb drag effects should be mentioned in this context , which may result in spin polarization of charge current due to intrinsic friction between electrons with different spin projections induced by coulomb scattering .",
    "@xcite    in all these propositions the possibilities of _ conversion _ of charge current into spin current were discussed .",
    "it is possible also to try to use the external electric field for the _ generation _ of spin current or another spin response .",
    "one such idea was formulated recently for light emitting diodes ( led ) based on conjugated polymers , @xcite where dissociation of excitons in a strong enough electric field may result in the accumulation of up and down spin densities near the two ends of the led .    in this paper",
    "we show that the charge input signal applied to the gate electrode in double ( dqd ) and triple quantum dots ( tqd ) forming closed loops ( equilateral triangle ) may be conversed to a pulse in kondo cotunneling current , which is in fact the spin response of dqd under strong coulomb blockade .",
    "the general idea of such a conversion was formulated in our previous paper @xcite ( hereafter referred as i ) .",
    "using the example of a t - shaped dqd occupied by two electrons we have shown that the charge - spin conversion is possible due to the specific dynamical symmetry of a spin multiplet consisting of two singlets and a triplet . since the states in this multiplet are constrained by casimir operators of the group @xmath1 characterizing the dynamical symmetry,@xcite the time - dependent perturbation in the charge sector which affects only the singlet states results in a time - dependent potential acting on the triplet states .",
    "an important aspect of the problem is the interplay between the coherent ( adiabatic ) and stochastic components of the input signal . in paper",
    "i we concentrated mainly on the _ coherent _ signal and discussed in details the conversion of charge noise into spin response in kondo tunneling .",
    "this response may be interpreted as dephasing and decoherence of the kondo screening . here",
    "we develop the general scheme , where both coherent and stochastic response of kondo tunneling to the time - dependent gate voltage are calculated .",
    "besides , the decoherence due to the noise component of the input signal is considered in the long relaxation limit contrary to i , where the white noise approximation was considered for the noise correlation function .",
    "another mechanism of charge - to - spin conversion may be realized in an equilateral triangular tqd in an external magnetic field penetrating the triangle plane .",
    "this model was introduced in ref . with the purpose of studying the interference between kondo tunneling and aharonov - bohm interference ( see ref . for an experimental realization ) .",
    "the actual dynamical symmetry of tqd in a contact with metallic electrodes is @xmath2 because the system possesses two spin and two orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "we show in this paper that the time dependent gate potential affects only the orbital component of multiplet , but the kondo tunneling is sensitive to this perturbation because both orbital and spin discrete degrees of freedom are involved in kondo screening .",
    "the subject of our calculations is the study of the transformation of the charge input signal into a kondo response of complex quantum dots in tunnel contact with source and drain electrodes .",
    "we study the mechanism of activation of internal spin degrees of freedom by means of a time - dependent gate potential applied to passive electrode .",
    "two examples of complex nano - devices will be considered .",
    "the first is an asymmetric double quantum dot ( dqd ) which contacts with metallic leads in a so called t - shape geometry ( fig . [ f.1]a ) .",
    "the second is a triple quantum dot ( tqd ) in the form of an equilateral triangle in a three - terminal configuration , where the bias is established between the dots 2,3 and the time - dependent gate potential is applied to the dot 1 ( ( fig . [",
    "f.1]b ) .        in both cases the electron tunneling is described by the anderson hamiltonian @xmath3 where three terms are related to band electrons in the leads , electrons in the complex dot and tunneling coupling between two subsystems , respectively .",
    "the lead hamiltonian has the form @xmath4 here @xmath5 stands for the leads , @xmath6 are the wave vector and spin projection , respectively .",
    "the leads are identical in our model , ( @xmath7 ) so it is convenient to re - expand the lead electron states @xmath8 in terms of irreducible basis states @xmath9 of the corresponding point symmetry groups ( mirror symmetry for dqd and triangular symmetry for tqd ) .    the hamiltonian of the dot is written as @xmath10 the potential wells in a complex qd are enumerated by the index @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 describes electron states in the potential well @xmath11 under the coulomb blockade @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the occupation number operators . the second term @xmath15 stands for the interdot tunneling . by convention @xmath16",

    "this coupling is described by the last term in ( [ 1.1 ] ) , @xmath17n_1~,\\ ] ] where the gate voltage contains both a static component @xmath18 and a time - dependent perturbation @xmath19 .",
    "the tunneling term in the hamiltonian ( [ 1.0 ] ) has the form @xmath20 the values of @xmath11 and @xmath21 are determined by the geometry of the complex qd ( see below ) .",

    "may be easily taken into account in an adiabatic approximation,@xcite whereas the second term in ( [ htime ] ) results in the stochastization of the quantum state of the complex qd .",
    "we are interested in the influence of such a time - dependent perturbation on the electron cotunneling through complex qds in kondo regime . to investigate this influence",
    "one should derive the effective spin hamiltonian from ( [ 1.0 ] ) by means of a time - dependent schrieffer - wolff ( sw ) transformation@xcite taking into account the perturbation @xmath40 in ( [ htime ] ) .",
    "the adiabatic component of this perturbation results in temporal oscillations of kondo transparency and enhances the tunnel conductance on average,@xcite whereas the stochastic component of the gate potential is detrimental for kondo tunneling .",
    "it results in the loss of coherence of the kondo singlet state and in the smearing of zero bias anomaly in tunnel conductance . in accordance with the general approach to decoherence",
    "phenomena,@xcite one should discriminate between the decoherence of the ground state of a quantum - mechanical ensemble and its manifestation at a finite energy / temperature . in the latter case one should argue in terms of dephasing due to elastic and inelastic scattering .",
    "both processes are relevant in our system ( see i ) .    in the two next sections",
    "we will show how the coherent part of @xmath41 results in the conversion of the charge input signal to a kondo response , and why its stochastic component brings an end to this process .",

    "the irreducible set @xmath9 consists of two combinations of source ( @xmath43 ) and drain ( @xmath44 ) leads . only even standing wave @xmath45 enters @xmath46 ( [ htun ] ) , and we omit in what follows the index @xmath47 .",
