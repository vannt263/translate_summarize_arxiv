    "although this dichotomy exists for all observed species , a few abundant high density tracers like ch@xmath7cn and c@xmath36s , show emission of nearly equal strength toward both positions ( fig .",

    "our sma data are insensitive to spatial structures @xmath40 , but it seems likely that sma2 is associated with the larger scale @xmath345 km  s@xmath9  component .    for ch@xmath41oh towards sma2 ( at @xmath345 km  s@xmath9 ) , and so@xmath37 and hc@xmath41n toward hw2-ne ( at @xmath3410.5 km",

    "emission from the two velocity components are well - separated , even though they are not completely spatially resolved by our observations ( fig .",
    "the ch@xmath41oh and so@xmath37 data have been corrected for optical depth effects by first estimating the opacity of one transition using a less abundant isotopologue and assuming galactic abundance ratios of @xmath26c/@xmath27c=70 and @xmath42s/@xmath36s=23 ( * ? ? ?",

    "a moderate optical depth in the lower lying hc@xmath41n lines is also possible ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , correction for which would yield an hc@xmath41n @xmath43 more consistent with so@xmath37 .",
    "three of the lower energy a - type transitions of ch@xmath41oh and the two lowest energy transitions of hc@xmath41n are also detected toward hw3c - sma and sma4 ; rotation diagram analysis for these two submm cores yield @xmath43=@xmath44 k.    in addition to the kinematic and chemical dichotomy between sma2 and hw2-ne , their @xmath43  differ by more than 100 k. both values of @xmath43  ( fig .",
    "2 ) are significantly larger than reported by @xcite based on @xmath45 resolution vla nh@xmath7 data ( @xmath43=30 - 50 k ) , influenced by their reported non - detection of nh@xmath7 ( 4,4 ) [ @xmath46 k ] .",
    "an nh@xmath7 ( 4,4 ) integrated intensity image from our reduction of these archival data is shown in figure 3 ; emission is clearly detected toward both hw2-ne and sma2 .",
    "a new analysis of the nh@xmath7 data gives @xmath43within a factor of two of those reported here .",
    "our @xmath43 are also larger than those estimated by @xcite ( 25 - 75 k ) though the sense of the temperature gradient is in agreement ( i.e. warmer in the e than w ) .",
    "although @xcite report that ch@xmath7cn ( 18 - 17 ) is not detected above k=3 , our reduction of their archival sma data detects ch@xmath7cn up through k=8 ( @xmath47 k , k=6 is shown in fig .",
    "3 ) , and we find similar @xmath43 to those shown in fig .",
    "2 . using 30 m data , @xcite derived @xmath43@xmath48 k for 3 mm so@xmath37 and hc@xmath7n transitions toward hw2-ne , however , beam dilution may well play a role in this single dish result .",

    "1b ) could be interpreted as a velocity gradient across a continuous structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the dramatic chemical and thermal differentiation demonstrated by our multi - species analysis is difficult to explain with this picture .",
    "chemical and thermal gradients might be expected in the radial and vertical directions within a protostellar disk , but such dramatic azimuthal asymmetries are more difficult to conceive in a single source scenario .",
    "we also note that beyond a velocity gradient , the kinematic evidence for a keplerian rotating disk is quite weak .",
    "for example , the weakness of the emission at the central hw2 position in position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams such as those in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and in our own data , but not shown ) are inconsistent with theoretical expectations unless a central hole is invoked ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "even with this modification , it remains difficult to explain the unequal position offsets of the two velocity peaks from the hw2 stellar position ( see nh@xmath7 in fig.3 and the k=3 p - v diagram of * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the presence of multiple sources at different velocities naturally explains the observed behavior .",
    "we therefore favor the multiple source hypothesis ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with at least three sources in the vicinity of hw2 ( hw2-sma , hw2-ne , and sma2 ) .",

    "the derived masses are very sensitive to the assumed temperatures ( table 2 ) . for sma2 , hw3c , and sma4 ,",
    "we have used the range of dust temperatures from rotation diagram analysis (  2.2 ) .",
    "temperatures for hw2-sma and sma1 are difficult to estimate due to the proximity of strong emission from hw2-ne and sma2 .",
    "no species peak at the position of hw2-sma suggesting it is not very warm ( i.e. compared to sma2 or hw2-ne ) , though its association with the strong bipolar jet suggests it is unlikely to be very cold either .",
    "thus we have assumed a moderate temperature range of 40 to 100 k for hw2-sma . since sma1 is lacking both a cm - wavelength counterpart and any distinct line emission we assume a cooler lower limit ( 20 k ) . with these assumptions",
    "the total gas masses are fairly low , ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 m@xmath5 .",
    "if these are preprotostellar cores , this result implies that a _ massive _ star will not form ; if , however , an embedded star is present ( almost certainly true for hw2-sma ) these masses are consistent with typical values observed for intermediate mass protostellar disks ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "no compact submm emission corresponding to hw8 , hw9 , hw3a , hw3b , or hw3d is detected .",
    "hw3a , hw8 and hw9 are variable at cm - wavelengths and are thought to be low mass pre - main - sequence stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , hence it is unsurprising that any submm emission is below our @xmath62 detection threshold of 40 mjy  beam@xmath9 . based in part on the detection of very compact ( @xmath23 ) 2 cm emission toward hw3d @xcite , @xcite suggest that hw3d contains its own internal energy source but also has thermal jet - like extended cm - wavelength emission .",
    "given its lack of distinct submm continuum or line emission we suggest instead that hw3d is a one - sided ionized jet emanating from hw3c - sma ( see fig .",
    "hw3b is consistent with being a one - sided jet emanating from sma4 or possibly the counterjet to hw3d ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "we detect at least five submm sources ( hw2-sma , sma1 , sma2 , hw3c - sma , and sma4 ) within a projected radius of @xmath63 ( 2900  au ) .",
    "if the five low mass sources hw3a , hw8 , hw9 , vla - r5 , and vla - r4 @xcite are included and equal clustering in the perpendicular dimension is assumed , then the implied protostellar density is @xmath64 .",
