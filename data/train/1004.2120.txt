    "understanding the formation of massive elliptical galaxies remains a crucial unsolved issue of galaxy evolution .",
    "the recent discovery and the first redshift measurements , through deep ultraviolet ( uv ) rest - frame spectroscopy , of a substantial population of passively evolving galaxies at @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that quenching of star formation in the most massive galaxies was already well under way at @xmath16 .",
    "a puzzling property of such objects has been revealed soon afterwards with some of them being found to have a factor of @xmath17 smaller effective radii compared to local early - type galaxies ( etgs ) of the same stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , implying that they are @xmath18 times denser than their possible descendants in the local universe .",
    "several alternative mechanisms have been proposed to make such compact etgs grow in size so to finally meet the properties of local etgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but no general consensus has yet emerged .    on the other hand , etgs at @xmath15 with large effective radii , comparable to the local etgs ,",
    "have also been found ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) , indicating a diversity of structural properties in the etg population at @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , possible effects have also been discussed that could bias size estimates towards lower values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an independent way to check these issues is by measuring stellar velocity dispersions ( @xmath12 ) : if high-@xmath1 etgs are really super - dense , their @xmath12 should be much higher than that of local etgs of the same mass . @xcite",
    "measured @xmath12 from deep uv rest - frame spectroscopy of a sample of 9 etgs at @xmath19 from the gmass survey @xcite , finding two galaxies with similar stellar density and @xmath12 as local etgs of the same mass .",
    "the remaining galaxies have higher stellar densities and higher @xmath12 from their stacked spectrum , but still overlapping with the densest local etgs .    in this respect ,",
    "near - infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy offers a great advantage for the galaxies at @xmath20 as the optical break at rest - frame @xmath21   and @xmath22 ( the strongest spectral features of passively evolving galaxies ) are redshifted into nir , and the rest - frame optical continuum is much brighter than that in the rest - frame uv .",
    "thus , @xcite measured a velocity dispersion of @xmath23  @xmath4 for a compact etg at @xmath24 using a deep nir spectrum from @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath12 is much higher than that of the most massive local etgs , and would be consistent with the small half light radius measured for that galaxy .",
    "in this letter we present a rest - frame optical spectrum of a massive , passively evolving high redshift galaxy candidate taken with the multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at subaru telescope",
    ". a cosmology with @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 @xmath4  mpc@xmath28 is assumed .",
    "we have obtained 4.7  hours of moircs spectroscopy of 34 bzk - selected galaxies @xcite from the catalog of @xcite in the cosmos field .",
    "we used the zj500 grism with @xmath29 slits , providing a resolution of @xmath30 in the @xmath31-band over the range 950016000 .",
    "the primary aim of our observation was to measure redshifts for passive bzk galaxies ( pbzks ) and locate them accurately in the cosmos large scale structure .",
    "we preferentially selected the most massive pbzks ( which are also the brightest in the nir ) to maximize the chance of determining also physical information in addition to redshifts for at least a fraction of them , in particular the galaxy ( # 254025 ) discussed in this paper and already studied by @xcite .",
    "the observations were made under partly cloudy conditions and with @xmath32 seeing .",
    "a sequence of 600s integrations were made in a two position dithering pattern separated by @xmath33 .",
    "the a0v - type star hip 55627 was observed to obtain ( relative ) flux calibration and to correct for telluric absorption .",
    "the data were reduced using the _ mcsmdp _ pipeline ( yoshikawa et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , including flat - fielding by dome flat , sky subtraction between each exposure pairs , bad pixel and cosmic ray rejection , distortion correction , wavelength calibration ( based on the oh telluric lines ) , residual sky subtraction and finally co - addition with appropriate offsets and weights .",
    "the 2-dimensional spectra are flux - calibrated using the standard star spectrum , and 1-dimensional spectra were extracted with the iraf _ apall _ task using a @xmath34 aperture .",
    "the absolute flux calibration was then obtained by normalizing to the @xmath31-band total magnitude .    whilst the results for the complete sample observed with moircs will be presented elsewhere",
    "we will concentrate here on the pbzk galaxy # 254025 .",
    "this galaxy one of the 12 ultra - massive high redshift etg candidates in @xcite , with a photometric redshift of @xmath35 and very bright nir magnitudes of @xmath36 and @xmath37 . @xcite",

    "hst_/acs f814w imaging ( rest - frame uv ) they measure a srsic index @xmath41 and an effective radius of @xmath42  kpc , consistent with the stellar mass - size relation of local elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : specall ] shows the resulting 1d and 2d moircs spectra of # 254025 .",
    "the 4000   break is clearly seen , together with strong balmer and metallic absorption lines , namely @xmath43+h@xmath44 , @xmath45 , h@xmath46 , h@xmath47 , h@xmath48 , g - band and cn+h@xmath49 .",
    "h@xmath50falls in the region with low atmospheric transmission and with strong oh - lines .",
    "no emission lines are observed . while [ ] @xmath51 falls in a region with low atmospheric transmission , [ ] @xmath52 is uncontaminated and its non - detection sets a @xmath53 upper limit of sfr of @xmath54 ( not corrected for extinction ) , using the @xcite conversion . from the spectrum ,",
    "the absorption line redshift is measured as @xmath55 .",
    "having determined the spectroscopic redshift , we proceeded to fit stellar population templates , separately to the broad - band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and to the moircs spectrum .",
    "we allowed for a wide range of possible star formation histories ( sfhs ) , including : ( 1 ) instantaneous bursts , i.e. , simple stellar populations ( ssp ) ; ( 2 ) constant sfrs for a duration within 0.013.5  gyr   is about 3.5  gyr , given the adopted cosmology . ] , terminated by sf quenching and followed by passive evolution ; ( 3 ) delayed , exponentially declining sfh described as @xmath56 with @xmath57 within @xmath58@xmath6  gyr ; ( 4 ) exponentially increasing sfh , @xmath59 for a duration within @xmath60@xmath61  gyr , followed by sf quenching and passive evolution .",
    "we choose @xmath62  gyr , corresponding to a stellar mass doubling time of @xmath63  gyr , as suggested for @xmath64 galaxies by the existence of tight stellar mass - sfr relation , with @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "for all the sfhs , template ages were allowed to range in @xmath66@xmath67  gyr .",
    "we use a @xcite imf .",
    "the fits were made with metallicities of 0.5@xmath68 , @xmath69 and 2@xmath68 .",
    "to reduce the number of free parameters we have assumed no dust extinction , appropriate for a passively evolving galaxy , considering the strict upper limit on the sfr that is set by the spectrum , an assumption that is validated by the good fit that is achieved in the blue continuum ( see figure [ fig : specall ] ) .",
    "the sed fitting was carried out for the broad - band @xmath70 data from subaru / suprime - cam @xcite , @xmath71 data from cfht / wircam @xcite , and the @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 data @xcite .",
    "artificial errors of 0.05 mag for the @xmath75 bands and 0.1 mag for the irac bands are added to the observed errors in quadrature to account for systematics in zero - point determinations , in the photometric measurements , and in the stellar population models .",
    "the templates for the sed fitting are generated from population synthesis models by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ) .",
    "the spectral resolution of the models is significantly lower than that of our moircs spectrum .",
    "hence , for fitting the spectrum , we used templates from the ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) spectral synthesis library . although these models might not account properly for tp - agb stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , this effect is not significant at 4000  rest - frame , the wavelength range probed by our spectrum .",
    "the template spectra are gaussian - broadened to an overall velocity dispersion of 350  @xmath4 ( see  [ sec : sigma ] ) to match that the observed spectrum , and having fixed it the stellar population parameters are derived with the @xmath76 over the observed wavelength range 950016000 .    the stellar population parameters of the best - fit models from each adopted sfh are listed in table [ tab : fitting ] and the best - fit templates for the spectrum and sed are shown in figures [ fig : specall ] and [ fig : sedbest ] , respectively .",
    "the best fit spectra have star - formation ( sf ) weighted ages of @xmath77  gyr and stellar masses of @xmath78 for the broad - band sed , and @xmath79  gyr and stellar mass of @xmath80 for the spectrum .",
    "the best fit results are from @xmath81 for the sed and @xmath82 for the spectrum . however , for the spectrum very similar values are derived using solar metallicity models that result in a slightly higher @xmath76 ( table  1 ) .",
    "we notice that solar , or slightly supersolar metallicities are appropriate for local elliptical galaxies with stellar masses similar to galaxy # 254025@xcite .",
    "the sf weighted age of @xmath83@xmath6  gyr corresponds to an average formation redshift of @xmath84@xmath8 , although the sf could have started much earlier . in the case of the spectral fitting ,",
    "all sfhs adopted here fit equally well with @xmath85 and @xmath5@xmath6  gyr , consistent with the detection of strong balmer absorption lines which are most prominent in a - type stars .",
    "moreover , in the case of the sed fits ( apart for the ssp spectra ) the various sfhs do not give very different @xmath76 values and therefore it is not possible to discriminate between them .",
    "the same can be said for the derived metallicities .",
    "if we allow for dust reddening , the best fitting @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 would change by only @xmath89% , with some increase of the formal uncertainties within each class of sfh .",
    "our high s / n spectrum ( @xmath90 per 60  @xmath4 spectral interval in the continuum ) allows us to measure a velocity dispersion from the absorption line width @xmath91 , which is a combination of the galaxy stellar velocity dispersion @xmath12 and the instrumental resolution @xmath92 . this s / n is comparable to spectra of gmass galaxies with successful individual @xmath12 determinations @xcite .",
    "therefore we followed the same approach of @xcite , based on the penalized pixel - fitting method ( ppxf ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the miles stellar library containing 985 stars @xcite is adopted here since it provides the best uniform and complete set of stars .",
    "figure [ fig : ppxf ] shows the best - fit templates from ppxf , corresponding to @xmath93 km s@xmath28 ( random ) @xmath94 30 km s@xmath28 ( systematic ) for the rest - frame wavelength range of @xmath95  .",
    "the random error ( @xmath96 confidence ) is determined as half of the interval in @xmath97 spanned by 68 out of 100 monte carlo realizations of the input spectrum .",
    "a rough estimate of the systematic error is obtained as half of the interval in @xmath97 spanned by all repeated extractions of the kinematics using different , but equally acceptable , combinations for the values of the degree ( from 04 ) of the additive and multiplicative polynomials in ppxf .",
    "restricting the fit to the region with the balmer and @xmath22lines ( @xmath98   in the rest - frame ) gives @xmath99 km s@xmath28 ( total error ) , consistent with the value derived from the full spectral range .    in order to derive @xmath12",
    "we need to determine accurately the instrumental resolution . to do this we have used our combined moircs spectrum without sky subtraction and simultaneously fitted gaussian profiles to a series of telluric oh - lines at @xmath100   , i.e. , near the strongest absorption features of the galaxy s spectrum . the central wavelength for each oh - line was taken from @xcite and we left @xmath92 , oh - line intensities , and constant baseline as free parameters",
    "the fitting procedure reproduces the observed sky spectra very well . over @xmath101@xmath102   , the instrumental resolution changes from 270 @xmath4 to 330 @xmath4 .",
    "we adopt @xmath103 @xmath4 ( random ) @xmath104 @xmath4 ( systematic ) .",
    "the derived galaxy stellar velocity dispersion is @xmath105 , which gives @xmath106 @xmath4 ( random ) @xmath107 @xmath4 ( systematic ) .",
    "the relatively large uncertainties in @xmath97 , and as @xmath97 is close to @xmath108 , we can not place a lower limit to @xmath12 . however , we can derive a @xmath96 upper limit of @xmath3 @xmath4 ( or @xmath109 @xmath4 at the @xmath110 level ) , which is consistent with both determinations .",
    "if balmer lines suffer from fill - in from emission lines @xmath12 could be somewhat lower .    from the stellar velocity dispersion",
    "the virial mass can be calculated as @xmath111 .",
    "we have set @xmath112 as empirically calibrated on local galaxies with state - of - the - art dynamical modeling @xcite , with the velocity dispersion being measured within a large aperture ( @xmath113 ) as in our case .",
    "the effective radius @xmath114 was measured by @xcite from the _",
    "hst_/acs f814w image ( @xmath115   in the rest - frame ) as @xmath116 or @xmath117  kpc at @xmath0 .",
    "thus the upper limit of the virial mass is derived as @xmath118 .",
    "we have also constructed a dynamical model based on axisymmetric jeans dynamical models as those used to model the gmass galaxies by @xcite , adopting a multi - gaussian expansion ( mge ; * ? ? ?",
    "this method has the advantage that the derived @xmath119 is virtually insensitive to possible underestimation of the size , which can be a possibility at high redshifts considering the bolometric surface brightness dimming of @xmath120 , a factor @xmath121 coming from the source redshifting and the @xmath122-correction between rest - frame 2900   to rest - frame @xmath123-band , we derived a rest - frame @xmath123-band luminosity of @xmath124 .",
    "the second moment of the velocity @xmath125 was also estimated ( assuming @xmath126 and axisymmetry ) by using the jeans anisotropic mge ( jam ) method @xcite .",
    "the upper limit for the dynamical @xmath88 can be calculated by @xmath127 , which can be converted into the upper limit of the dynamical mass from the jam model as @xmath128 .",
    "therefore the virial mass and jeans mass agree well though both of them are upper limits . a jam model constructed from a noiseless model with the best fitting srsic parameters of @xcite , as opposed to the actual acs image ,",
    "gives the same @xmath129 within 1% .",
    "this is due to the robustness of the central @xmath119 recovered using dynamical models ( in contrast to virial estimates ) to photometric uncertainties at large radii ( e.g. ,  3.2 in * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ fig : dynprop ] compares the properties of the galaxy # 254025and other @xmath16 galaxies for which the same quantities have been measured @xcite .",
    "the figure includes etgs at @xmath130 , selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) on the base of their red @xmath131 color and high srsic index @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "the dynamical and stellar masses agree very well for the high-@xmath1 objects , within a factor of @xmath133 .",
    "note that our massive galaxy has physical properties in good agreement with those of local etgs of similar stellar mass .",
    "our galaxy provides a second example of a very massive passively evolving system for which a stellar velocity dispersion has been measured ( the gmass objects of @xcite , which in figure [ fig : dynprop ] also lie on the @xmath14 scaling relations , but have stellar masses below @xmath134 ) .",
    "the `` normal '' size and velocity dispersion of our massive etg is strikingly in contrast with the extreme properties ( i.e. , a very high @xmath135  @xmath4 and a small @xmath136  kpc ) of the galaxy studied by @xcite with similar stellar mass ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "this suggests a substantial diversity in the physical properties of the _ massive _ etg population at @xmath13 including `` immature '' , albeit virialized , systems  which will have to evolve into normal @xmath14 massive galaxies through some physical processes which decrease their velocity dispersion and increase their sizes  as well as `` mature '' etgs , already on the scaling relationships of @xmath14 etgs .",
    "it is clear that many more observations of similar galaxies are required to establish which kind of etg is commonest at high redshift : either the compact / high-@xmath12 objects like those found by @xcite , or the apparently normal , low-@xmath12 objects presented in this paper .",
    "also , nothing prevents our particular object to evolve further from its present state which mimics that of local ellipticals of the same mass .",
    "for example , it may grow further and become a _ brightest cluster galaxy _",
    "( bcg ) or a cd galaxy .",
    "for this reason , it would be important to estimate the volume number density of similar objects at high redshifts , and compare it to that of bcgs and cd galaxies .    to conclude , both very compact etgs and etgs following the local stellar mass - size and stellar mass-@xmath12 relations appear to co - exist at @xmath15 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however the number of high-@xmath1 etgs with individual measurement of the velocity dispersion is still extremely small . increasing their sample is of great importance to understand the evolution of these galaxies , and in particular how and when they acquire their final structural and dynamical configuration .",
    "this paper demonstrates that with reasonable telescope time several absorption features can be detected in the rest - frame optical spectrum of the high-@xmath1 etgs , from which ( at least for the most massive etgs ) the velocity dispersion and several stellar population properties can be derived .",
