    "interstellar ices incorporated into the envelopes and disks of young stellar objects ( ysos ) may subsequently be heated , chemically or structurally modified or destroyed by energetic processes such as exposure to radiation , shocks and winds .",
    "the study of ices in the environments of ysos is currently a highly active field , driven by the rich legacy of infrared spectra available from the infrared space observatory ( iso ) and the spitzer space telescope ( e.g. , de  graauw et  al .",

    "ices formed and maintained at low temperature are amorphous in structure , but studies of laboratory analogs have demonstrated the appearance of subfeatures in the 15@xmath1 m  profile upon heating that are diagnostic of segregation and crystallization of constituents ( ehrenfreund et  al .  1997 , 1999 ; dartois et  al .  1999 ;",
    "van broekhuizen et  al .",
    "2006 ; white et  al .",
    "these subfeatures have , indeed , been observed in the infrared spectra of a variety of high- and low - mass ysos ( see pontoppidan et  al .",
    "2008 for numerous examples ) .",
    "the properties of pristine ices in cold , quiescent regions of dense molecular clouds provide an important benchmark for studies of the evolution of interstellar matter and the origins of stars and planetary systems .",
    "to study ices in such regions , it is necessary to observe background field stars viewed through the dense material , and this is much more difficult compared with ysos because of their relatively weak intrinsic flux at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "first detection of co@xmath0-ice in a field star resulted from iso observations of its near infrared ( 4.2@xmath1 m ) stretching - mode feature in the spectrum of the taurus k - type giant elias  16 ( whittet et  al .",
    "subsequent observations with spitzer confirmed the presence of the bending - mode feature in this line of sight ( bergin et  al .  2005 ; knez et  al .",
    "2005 ) , exhibiting a profile that is , as expected , notably lacking in structure associated with heating and crystallization of the ices .",
    "the feature is consistent with models that utilize data for laboratory analogs at low temperature , combining ` polar ' ( h@xmath0o - rich ) and ` non - polar ' ( h@xmath0o - poor ) components ( e.g.  gerakines et  al .",
    "detections of co@xmath0  in the spectra of a further 8  field stars behind the taurus dark - cloud complex have since been reported ( whittet et  al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "consistency was found both in the co@xmath0  abundance ( @xmath3 relative to h@xmath0o ) and in the 15@xmath1 m  profile shape : each line of sight displays a profile essentially identical to that of elias  16 to within observational error .",
    "this result implies that the ices in taurus have been maintained at low temperature since their formation , and furthermore that the formation process is fairly robust and uniformly efficient at several locations in the cloud .",
    "taurus has ( by default ) become the prototype for study of ices in low - mass star - formation regions because of the relative ease with which they are detected in this dark - cloud complex .",
    "a key question is whether it is a _",
    "reliable _ prototype .",
    "substantial cloud - to - cloud variations are known to exist , for example , in ambient radiation field ( liseau et  al .",
    "1999 ) and grain temperature ( white et  al .",
    "1995 ) , and also in gas phase chemistry between clouds of similar temperature , density and radiative environment ( dickens et  al .",
    "it is important to determine whether such variations have an appreciable impact on the composition and physical state of the ices in order to test the validity of taurus as a prototype .",
    "however , background field stars bright enough at 15@xmath1 m  to yield spectra of sufficient quality and with enough extinction to show deep interstellar features are rare . to date",
    "the profile of the sensitive co@xmath0  bending mode has been reported in only one confirmed background field star outside of the taurus region : ck2 in serpens ( knez et  al .",
    "the serpens dark cloud differs from that in taurus in both structure and content : it is more centrally condensed , with higher average gas densities , and displays greater intermediate - mass star formation activity leading to warmer ambient gas temperatures ( @xmath4k compared with @xmath5k ; white et  al .",

    "2000 ; kaas et  al .",
    "there is evidence also to suggest differences in ice composition between the two clouds , with ( e.g. ) an excess of co and/or co@xmath0  relative to h@xmath0o  in serpens compared with taurus ( eiroa & hodapp 1989 ; chiar et  al .",

    "we compare results for the three regions now available  taurus , serpens and ic  5146  and show that they do , indeed , support the existence of a common 15@xmath1 m  ice profile for unprocessed ices in the cold dark - cloud environment .",
    "our results also allow new constraints to be placed on the ice formation process .",
    "all co@xmath0  spectra used in this work were obtained with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) of the spitzer space telescope , described by houck et  al .",
    "the irs operated in short - wavelength , high - resolution staring mode , covering the spectral range 10.019.5@xmath1 m  at a resolving power @xmath6 . the astronomical observation request ( aor ) keys and other relevant information",
    "are given in table  1 for our three program stars .",
    "the spectrum of q211 ( ic  5146 ) , reported here for the first time , was obtained on 2004 november  12 as part of the spitzer general observer program # 3320 ( principal investigator : y.  pendleton ) ; three ramp cycles were carried out to yield a total on - source integration time of 7975s , and a spectrum of the sky background in the region was also obtained to provide background subtraction .",
    "the raw spectra were processed by the standard spitzer pipeline to produce basic calibrated data ( bcd ) .",
    "version 15.3.0 of the pipeline was used to reduce the data for q211 and also for ck2 ( a reduction of the ck2 spectrum using pipeline version 11.0.2 was previously published by knez et  al .",

    "we use the spectrum reported by bergin et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , processed with version  13.0 of the pipeline .",
    "further analysis of the bcd to produce final calibrated spectra of q211 and ck2 was carried out using the smart program ( higdon et  al .",
    "2004 ) and standard procedures to remove bad pixels and other artifacts , as described in  2 of whittet et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    the final calibrated flux spectrum of q211 is shown in fig .",
    "a local continuum was determined by fitting a second - order polynomial to adjacent wavelength regions on each side of the co@xmath0  feature ( 13.014.9@xmath1 m  and 16.117.6@xmath1 m ) .",
    "the adopted continuum , shown as a dashed curve in fig .",
    "1a , was used to calculate the optical depth spectrum plotted in fig .",
    "the same procedure was used to produce an optical depth spectrum for ck2 ( see below ) ; our result for ck2 is broadly consistent with that reported by knez et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , allowing for differences in the adopted continuum .",
    "the final optical depth profiles of the co@xmath0  features observed in ck2 and q211 are shown in fig .  2 , together with fits based on laboratory analogs ( table  2 ) .",
    "3 ( lower frame ) compares the profiles of ck2 and q211 with that of elias  16 , superposed with normalization to unity at peak optical depth .",
    "it is evident from inspection that the observed profiles in the three lines of sight are closely similar , indeed virtually identical to within observational error .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the random nature of the scatter in the residual optical depths for ck2 and q211 relative to elias  16 , shown in the upper frame of fig .",
    "the fitting procedure used to model the co@xmath0  profile is the same as described in our previous work ( e.g.  gerakines et  al .",
    "1999 ; bergin et  al .",
    "2005 ) , but with access to a much larger suite of analog spectra now available .",
    "the procedure assumes that the profile can be modeled by a combination of two ice components  bending - mode profiles in ysos ( pontoppidan et  al .",
    "2008 ) . ] : one contains co@xmath0  in a matrix dominated by h@xmath0o  ( the polar component ) , the other contains co and co@xmath0 , but little or no h@xmath0o  ( the nonpolar component )",
    ". some analogs also contain methanol ( ch@xmath7oh ) , which can affect the shape of the co@xmath0  bending mode ( ehrenfreund et  al .",
    "a total of 1381  laboratory spectra is available from the databases of the astrophysics laboratories of leiden university ( ehrenfreund et  al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) and the university of alabama at birmingham ( white et  al .",
    "2009 ) , spanning a wide range of temperature as well as composition .",
    "we fit each spectrum independently to further test the hypothesis that the profiles are effectively the same .",
    "best fits resulting from our least - squares fitting procedure are summarized in table  2 and plotted in fig .",
    "2 for ck2 and q211 ( our fit to elias  16 is similar to that shown in fig .  2 of bergin et  al .",
    "as expected , the combinations of ices selected are qualitatively and quantitatively similar , with temperatures in the range 1020  k ; indeed the same polar ice mixture was selected in each case , and the nonpolar mixtures differ only in co : co@xmath0  ratio .",
    "in fact , the fits are not very sensitive to co@xmath0  concentration in either component different mixtures give almost equally good fits ( see also  4.1 below )  but they are robust in terms of three essential requirements : ( i )  both polar and nonpolar components must be present , ( ii )  both components must be at low temperature ( @xmath8  k ) , and ( iii )  the profile is dominated by the polar component , which contributes @xmath990% of the total absorption in each line of sight .",
    "none of the ch@xmath7oh - bearing mixtures were selected by the fitting process , consistent with available limits on its solid - state abundance in dark clouds ( chiar et  al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the integrated optical depth , @xmath10 , of the observed absorption feature in each program star was estimated , and results are listed in table  1 . this quantity",
    "is directly related to column density : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the band strength .",
    "gerakines et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) showed that the band strength of the co@xmath0  bending mode is only weakly dependent on the ice mixture in which the co@xmath0  resides , and we therefore adopt an average value of @xmath13  cm / molecule , consistent with our previous work ( whittet et  al .",
    "column densities for co@xmath0  are listed in table  2 , together with values for other major constituents of the ices ( h@xmath0o  and co ) from the literature .",
    "all @xmath14(h@xmath0o ) values are determined from ground - based observations of the 3.0@xmath1 m  o ",
    "h stretching mode , which generally gives more reliable results than the blended o  h  o bending mode near 6@xmath1 m .",
    "4 plots co and co@xmath0  ice column densities against that of h@xmath0o .",
    "in addition to elias  16 , ck2 and q211 , all taurus field stars with available data are included ( whittet et  al .  2007 and references therein ) .",
    "the straight lines are linear least - squares fits to taurus stars only .",
    "the fit to @xmath14(co ) vs.  @xmath14(h@xmath0o ) displays a positive intercept on the @xmath14(h@xmath0o)-axis , as expected , as h@xmath0o  is less volatile and can exist in solid form at lower dust columns compared with co. it is evident ( fig .",
    "4a ) that both ck2 in serpens and q211 in ic  5146 have significantly higher co@xmath0/h@xmath0o  abundance ratios compared with members of the taurus group ( which show a rather tight correlation ) .",
    "systematic differences are less apparent in the plot of @xmath14(co ) vs.  @xmath14(h@xmath0o ) , suggestive of a common trend ( fig .",
    "4b ) albeit with appreciable scatter ; the locus of q211 , in particular , is closely consistent with the taurus correlation .",
    "the results described in the previous section demonstrate that the co@xmath0  ice feature near 15@xmath1 m  displays a common profile shape in three widely separated dense clouds .",
    "the available spectra are consistent with a combination of polar ( h@xmath0o - rich ) and nonpolar ( co - rich ) ices at low temperature ( 1020  k ) , the polar component accounting for @xmath290% of the co@xmath0 .",
    "any elevation in ice temperature arising from proximity to embedded stars ( e.g. , serpens : see  1 ) must not be sufficient to affect the profile in the lines of sight studied .",
    "interestingly , this commonality of profile also occurs notwithstanding a clear difference in the composition of the ices , manifested by discontinuity in the @xmath14(co@xmath0 ) vs.  @xmath14(h@xmath0o ) correlation for ic  5146 and serpens compared to taurus ( fig .",
    "in this section , we explore possible implications of these results .",
    "we hypothesize that the compositional discontinuity between clouds may arise from variations in only one parameter : the co@xmath0/h@xmath0o  ratio in the polar ices .",
    "it was noted previously that the bending - mode absorption profiles of ices containing co@xmath0  are not strongly sensitive to co@xmath0  concentration at a given temperature .",
    "this remains true provided only that the ices maintain their compositional and structural ` identity ' ( e.g. , a polar mixture contains enough h@xmath0o  to remain ` polar ' ) . for illustration ,",
    "we compare in fig .  5 the profiles for several polar laboratory ice mixtures at low temperature , with co@xmath0  concentration varying between 14% and 100% relative to h@xmath0o .",
    "slight differences in position and width are seen , but the profile shape is maintained over this rather broad compositional range .",
    "it is therefore unsurprising that observed profiles are closely similar in lines of sight with different co@xmath0/h@xmath0o  ratios .",
    "polar ices are thought to form on interstellar grains by surface reactions involving species ( principally h , o and co ) adsorbed from the gas phase in the  diffuse - dense \" transition region of a molecular cloud where h @xmath15 h@xmath0 conversion is incomplete . in brief , the main chemical pathways appear to be hydrogenation of o to oh and h@xmath0o , and oxidation of co to co@xmath0 , with no more than trace amounts of the co undergoing hydrogenation to form cho - bearing species such as ch@xmath7oh  ( e.g. , tielens & whittet 1997 )  formation is not yet fully understood because of uncertainties in the rates of key surface reactions such as co + o @xmath15 co@xmath0  and co + oh @xmath15 co@xmath0  + h ; see ruffle & herbst ( 2001 ) and pontoppidan et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) for further discussion . ] .",
    "the co@xmath0/h@xmath0o  ratio in the resulting solid is likely to depend on the relative abundances of the adsorbed species , and thus on the network of chemical reactions occurring in the gas phase .",
    "local conditions may lead to variations .",
    "a cloud with a relatively high concentration of gas phase co relative to atomic h in the transition region will tend to produce a more co@xmath0-rich polar ice , whereas a cloud with a lower concentration of gas phase co will produce less co@xmath0  and free up more o to form h@xmath0o : the differences evident in fig .",
    "4a between taurus and the other clouds might be explained in this way . at higher densities ,",
    "h @xmath15 h@xmath0 conversion is essentially complete and h@xmath0o  can no longer form efficiently by surface reactions ; nonpolar ices then accumulate on the grains , principally by attachment of gas - phase co ( pontoppidan 2005 ) , which is abundant in the dense molecular phases of all dark clouds .",
    "formation of co@xmath0  within the nonpolar component may be driven by cosmic - ray processing of the solid co ( pontoppidan et  al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "it is informative to consider the distribution of elemental oxygen in the ices arising from these processes .",
    "ices , together with silicate dust and gas - phase co , represent the major observable oxygen reservoirs in the dense ism ( whittet et  al .  2007 and references therein ) .",
    "o is the most abundant heavy element and the only one present in all three of the major molecular ice species , h@xmath0o , co and co@xmath0 .",
    "atomic o attaching to a grain surface will undergo chemical reactions that lead to formation of h@xmath0o  and co@xmath0 , as outlined above : _ we hypothesize that the fraction of o atoms accumulating into the ices is robust but that their subsequent distribution between h@xmath0o  and co@xmath0  may vary from cloud to cloud .",
    "_    the total number of o atoms in the polar ices along a line of sight may be expressed in terms of column density by the relation @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the fractions of all solid - phase co and co@xmath0  molecules , respectively , in the polar ices .",
    "similarly , for the nonpolar ices , we have @xmath19 previous and current work suggests @xmath20 in serpens and @xmath21 in taurus and ic  5146 ( chiar et  al .  1994 , 1995 and in preparation )",
    "; @xmath18 is evaluated from the results of the present paper ( table  2 , right hand column ) .",
    "we ignore other species that might contain significant elemental oxygen in the ices , of which the most important is probably o@xmath0 ( see whittet et  al .",
    "2007 for further discussion ) .",
    "plots @xmath14(o ) for polar and nonpolar ices against visual extinction ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "as in fig .  4 , all available taurus field stars are included using data from whittet et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) in addition to results from the present work ( elias  16 has the highest @xmath22 value of the taurus stars plotted ) .",
    "@xmath22 is taken as a measure of total dust column .",
    "high degrees of correlation are evident in fig .  6 , with notable consistency between the three clouds for both polar and nonpolar ices : in contrast to the situation in fig .  4 , a single linear fit to all points is representative of the trend for each component of the ices .",
    "this result suggests stability in the net rate of accumulation of o atoms into ices on grain surfaces , regardless of differences in the efficiencies of chemical pathways that form h@xmath0o  and co@xmath0 .",
    "some caveats should be noted .",
    "first , the extinction toward ck2 is particularly uncertain : we have adopted the value from knez et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , but higher values have been estimated in earlier literature ( see discussion in  6 of whittet et  al .",
    "second , we are concerned only with the component of @xmath22 arising in dense clouds ( where grains are ice - mantled ) ; any systematic cloud - to - cloud differences in the extinction contributed by unmantled grains in diffuse phases of the ism along these lines of sight would lead to systematic error in the form of a horizontal shift in fig .",
    "6 . this contribution may be estimated empirically by evaluating the ice ` threshold ' extinction , i.e. , the intercept on the @xmath22 axis of fits to correlations of h@xmath0o - ice optical depth or column density with visual extinction : a value of @xmath23  mag is well documented for the taurus cloud ( whittet et  al .",
    "1988 , 2001 ) , and this is , indeed , consistent with the locus of the intercept of the linear fit to the polar component in fig .",
    "available data suggest somewhat higher thresholds for ic  5146 ( @xmath24  mag ; chiar et  al .  in preparation ) and serpens ( @xmath25  mag ; eiroa & hodapp 1989 )",
    ". however , in each case , the difference relative to the taurus value is smaller than the estimated uncertainty in @xmath22 for q211 and ck2 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we do not consider this potential source of error to be of major significance .",
    "6 suggests a uniform distribution of elemental oxygen between polar and nonpolar components , the latter accounting for @xmath26 of the total in the ices at high @xmath22 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by fig .",
    "7 , which plots @xmath14(o ) for polar ices against that for nonpolar ices ( eqs .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "7 is unaffected by any systematic error introduced by cloud - to - cloud difference in diffuse - ism extinction , and may be compared with fig .",
    "4b ( the largest contributions to o in polar and nonpolar ices being made by h@xmath0o  and co , respectively ) .",
    "the data are consistent with a linear correlation with continuity between clouds .",
    "the positive intercept of the fit on the @xmath14(o)@xmath27 axis in fig .",
    "7 is probably real ( c.f .",
    "4b ) and consistent with the lower volatility of polar ices compared with nonpolar ices .",
    "consistency in the distribution of matter between polar and nonpolar phases of the ice is indicated both by the correlations in figs.6 and 7 and by the results of the 15@xmath1 m  profile fitting (  3.1 ) .",
    "an unexpectedly high level of compositional homogeneity is implied : no major , systematic variations in the relative abundance of polar to nonpolar ice is apparent over a rather wide range of environments and extinctions ( @xmath28  mag ; fig .",
    "polar ices form at relatively low density , as discussed above , and their abundance is expected to correlate linearly with dust column ( i.e. , with @xmath22 ) if mantled grains are widely distributed throughout the clouds . in the case of nonpolar ices , however , the abundance of the primary species ( co ) is not dependent on formation in situ but rather on accumulation from the gas .",
    "the rate of accumulation would thus be expected to increase rapidly with density at high @xmath22 unless there is an efficient desorption mechanism .",
    "our results suggest that a balance is maintained between accretion and desorption of co. this situation is , indeed , entirely consistent with observations of gas - phase co in molecular clouds in general ( substantial levels of gas phase co are maintained in dense regions ) , and with laboratory work on the photodesorption properties of co ice ( see berg et  al .",
    "2007 for further discussion ) .",
    "the primary result of this study is a clear demonstration that the co@xmath0  ice bending - mode feature near 15@xmath1 m  displays essentially the same profile shape in lines of sight that intercept three widely separated dense clouds .",
    "this profile is likely to be a useful benchmark for investigations of co@xmath0-bearing ices in ysos , aiding separation of contributions made by the circumstellar environment and the parent molecular cloud to each observed spectrum .",
    "the shape of the observed profile elucidates the nature of the ices in the dense - cloud environment .",
    "comparisons with laboratory analogs confirm that the co@xmath0-bearing ices are maintained at low temperature and include both polar ( h@xmath0o - dominated ) and nonpolar ( co - dominated ) components .",
    "the polar component contains @xmath290% of all solid - phase co@xmath0 , but the concentration of co@xmath0  relative to h@xmath0o  is not tightly constrained .",
    "the constancy of the profile in the face of observed differences in the co@xmath0/h@xmath0o  abundance ratio is thus easily understood .",
    "cloud to cloud variations in co@xmath0/h@xmath0o  ratio may result from differences in gas phase chemistry , but the physical process of element depletion from the gas onto dust proceeds in a predictable manner .",
    "the elemental oxygen column density in the ices appears to be a unifying parameter , showing evidence of consistent behavior with respect to dust column in our sample .",
    "moreover , the distribution of elemental oxygen between polar and nonpolar ice appears to be almost invariant : the co - rich nonpolar component accounts for no more than @xmath26 , even in the densest regions sampled , a result which implies the existence of an efficient desorption mechanism for co in molecular cloud cores",
    ".    it will be important in the future to extend this work to a larger sample of field stars that probe quiescent regions of molecular clouds . given the constancy of profile observed to date , spectra obtained with the low - resolution mode of the spitzer irs may be adequate to extend abundance correlations such as those shown in figs.4 and 6 , allowing fainter stars to be included .",
    "opportunities to obtain high - quality spectra of other ice constituents best observed from airborne and/or space platforms will be provided in the next few years by the availability of the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy and the james webb space telescope .",

    "<S> we show the profile of the feature be consistent with a two - component ( polar + nonpolar ) model for the ices , based on spectra of laboratory analogs with temperatures in the range 1020  k. the polar component accounts for @xmath2% of the co@xmath0  in the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> we compare for the first time 15@xmath1 m  profiles in three widely separated dark clouds ( taurus , serpens and ic  5146 ) , and show that they are indistinguishable to within observational scatter . </S>",
    "<S> systematic differences in the observed co@xmath0/h@xmath0o  ratio in the three clouds have little or no effect on the 15@xmath1 m  profile . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance of elemental oxygen in the ices appears to be a unifying factor , displaying consistent behavior in the three clouds . </S>",
