    "the realization of a practical chip - based atom interferometer , using a bose - einstein condensate , ( bec ) would revolutionize internal navigation systems , precision measurements , and , perhaps , quantum information technology .",
    "the production and manipulation of a condensate using an atom chip is appealing for many reasons .",
    "the trapping potentials , for the same electrical current , have a much higher frequency then their larger scale counterparts @xcite . as a result , these devices require less power .",
    "an atomic cloud confined in a trap with a large frequency can be cooled to ultra - cold temperatures more rapidly @xcite , making the realization of a quasi - continuous source of condensed atoms more feasible .",
    "chips also enable integration of several relatively simple components into devices with complex functionality @xcite . finally , the entire device , including the vacuum chamber , can be miniaturized @xcite , making chip - based devices the most likely path to practical applications .",
    "the first experimentally realized bec - based interferometers used a double - well potential to manipulate the atoms @xcite . in this type of interferometer",
    ", atoms are initially prepared in a single potential well that confines the atoms in all three directions .",
    "then the well is continuously transformed into a symmetric double well , which must be done adiabatically slow to avoid collective excitations .",
    "after the splitting , the wells are physically separated and , due to differences in the local environment , a quantum phase shift may develop between the atoms in each well .",
    "nonlinearities , caused by atom - atom interactions , usually cause problems at the recombination stage in these types of interferometers . as a result",
    ", the atoms are recombined by suddenly switching off the trap allowing the two condensates to ballistically expand , overlap , and interfere .",
    "the phase shift can be measured by fitting the atomic density to a @xmath0 function .",
    "an alternative method for realizing a bec - based atom interferometer uses a standing light wave created by two counter - propagating laser pulses to manipulate the condensate @xcite .",
    "the bec is loaded into a waveguide providing confinement along two directions but not in the third one .",
    "the standing light wave splits the bec into two harmonics moving in opposite directions .",
    "a second laser pulse reflects the harmonics by reversing their momentum .",
    "finally , a third pulse recombines them , thus completing the interferometer sequence .",
    "since the atoms are recombined in the guide , the phase shift between the two arms of the interferometer can be measured by counting the atoms in the zero momentum state at the end of the interferometer cycle .    in the first experimental realization of this type of interferometer @xcite ,",
    "the coherence time was about 10  ms .",
    "the loss of coherence was theoretically explained as being due to distortion of the phase across each atomic cloud @xcite , which is caused by both the atom - atom interactions and the residual external parabolic potential in the axial direction .    a similar interferometer with a coherence time of 44",
    "ms has been realized in ref .",
    "the coherence time of this interferometer was increased in two ways .",
    "first , the confining waveguide was created using macroscopic conductors , instead of microscopic conductors in a chip - based device .",
    "this larger scale device had looser confinement thus reducing the effect of the atom - atom interactions . additionally , the waveguide was farther from the conductors minimizing small perturbations due to defects in the conductors or instabilities in the current .",
    "second , the interferometer sequence used two reflections , such that each half of the condensate went through the same path twice in opposite directions .",
    "this method greatly reduces the phase distortion caused by the residual axial potential .",
    "a third interferometer was recently realized in @xcite .",
    "this chip - based device has a coherence time of about 15  ms and uses a sightly different splitting technique .",
    "one of the lasers is frequency - shifted with respect to the other laser , resulting in a traveling wave optical potential . using a @xmath1 pulse ,",
    "the condensate is split into two harmonics one of which remains at rest and the other propagates with the momentum @xmath2 .",
    "a @xmath3 pulse acts as a mirror , and finally a second @xmath1 recombines the condensate . as a result of this different splitting mechanism ,",
    "the splitting and recombination does not take place in the same physical location and the device is an atom mach - zehnder interferometer . by varying the radial confinement of the waveguide , the researchers were able to change the effective strength of the atom - atom interactions .",
    "they used this to test the theoretical model of ref .",
    "@xcite and demonstrated its validity .    in this paper ,",
    "we discuss possible ways to increase the coherence time of an atom interferometer using bragg diffraction to manipulate the atoms .",
    "simple analytical expressions for the dynamics of the interference sequence are derived in the framework of the hydrodynamic approximation .",
    "their validity is confirmed by their comparison with direct numerical solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "we demonstrate that the coherence time can be increased by changing the recombination time and present simple analytic expressions for the optimized recombination time and the contrast",
    ".    in the rest of the section , we present a simple physical explanation for the loss of contrast in a bec michelson interferometer and discuss possible ways of restoring it .",
    "the interferometric cycle of duration @xmath4 starts by illuminating the motionless bec cloud @xmath5 with a splitting pulse from a pair of counter- propagating laser beams",
    ". this pulse acts like a diffraction grating splitting the cloud into two harmonics @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the atoms diffracted into the @xmath8 order absorb a photon from a laser beam with the momentum @xmath9 and re - emit it into the beam with the momentum @xmath10 acquiring the net momentum @xmath11 .",
    "the cloud @xmath6 starts moving with the velocity @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the wavenumber of the laser beams and @xmath14 is the atomic mass .",
    "similarly , the cloud @xmath7 starts moving with the velocity @xmath15 .",
    "the two harmonics are allowed to propagate for the time @xmath16 and are illuminated by a reflection optical pulse .",
    "the atoms in the harmonics @xmath6 change their velocity by @xmath17 and those in the harmonics @xmath7 by @xmath18 .",
    "the harmonics propagate back for time @xmath16 and are subject to the action of the recombination optical pulse . after the recombination",
    ", the atoms in general populate all three harmonics @xmath5 and @xmath19 .",
    "the degree of population depends on the relative phase between the harmonics @xmath19 acquired during the interferometric cycle and can be used to deduce this phase . in particular , the wave function of the zero - momentum harmonics @xmath5 after the recombination is equal to @xmath20 where @xmath19 are the wave functions of the @xmath21 harmonics immediately before the recombination .    because of the nonlinearity and/or the external potential , the harmonics @xmath19 do not travel with the velocities @xmath22 during the cycle .",
    "first , the cloud `` climbing up '' the external potential slows down and the one moving `` downhill '' speeds up .",
    "second , because of the nonlinearity , the speeds of the two clouds after their separation will be slightly larger than @xmath23 if the nonlinearity is repulsive and slightly less than @xmath23 if it is attractive . for definiteness",
    ", we shall discuss the influence of the repulsive nonlinearity assuming that the external potential is zero .",
    "an ideal operation of the interferometer in this case corresponds to all the atoms populating zero - momentum harmonics @xmath5 after the recombination , i.e. , to @xmath24 .    because of the atom - atom interaction , the clouds @xmath19",
    "exert a repulsive force on each other during the time they overlap .",
    "this force accelerates each cloud so that after the separation pulse the @xmath19 harmonics propagate with velocities @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "the reflection pulses impart the momenta @xmath27 to the clouds transforming their roles : @xmath28 . after the reflection ,",
    "the @xmath21 harmonics propagate with the velocities @xmath29 .",
    "harmonics deceleration due to mutual repulsion during their overlap decreases the velocity of each harmonics by an additional @xmath30 so immediately before the recombination the harmonics velocities are @xmath31 .    the nonzero value of @xmath30 results in two consequences .",
    "first , since the clouds speeds after the reflection pulse are smaller than before the pulse , the @xmath21 harmonics at the nominal recombination time still do not overlap each other completely .",
    "this effect is typically not very significant . much more important",
    "is the fact that the returning harmonics have momenta that are not equal to @xmath32 and therefore can not be compensated by the recombination pulse . as a result , the wave function of the zero - momentum harmonics @xmath5 after the recombination can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the density profiles of the harmonics ; their possible incomplete overlap has been neglected .",
    "the population of the zero - momentum harmonics is obtained by the spatial integration of @xmath36 . for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the characteristic size of the clouds , all the atoms after the recombination are indeed in the zeroth harmonics , i.e. @xmath24 . in the opposite case @xmath39 ,",
    "the @xmath0 function oscillates several times across the cloud and @xmath40 resulting in the loss of contrast .",
    "it is worth noting that the accumulation of corrections to the wave vectors of the clouds is due to the fact that the reflecting pulses do not reverse the clouds velocities but rather add a constant velocity @xmath41 to them .",
    "this explains the fact that the coherence may be lost due to the presence of an external potential even when the nonlinearity is negligible .",
    "the above - discussed loss of coherence due to incomplete cancelation of the wave vectors of the harmonics by the recombination pulse can be also visualized in the following way : the wave functions of the @xmath19 harmonics can be represented as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the parabolic phase ( the nominal phase @xmath44 is taken care of by the optical pulses and is not included ) .",
    "in the ideal situation , the parabolic phase for each cloud is centered at the middle of the cloud .",
    "nonzero values of @xmath30 ( or , equivalently , nonzero values of the corrections to the wave vectors of the clouds ) mean that the phase of each cloud leads or lags behind its density envelope .",
    "this situation is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] showing the harmonic @xmath6 before the recombination with its phase leading the density envelope .",
    "we shall show that the optimum recombination corresponds to the situation when the phase profiles , not the density envelopes of the clouds are on top of each other immediately before the recombination .",
    "operation with high values of the contrast can be achieved in several ways .",
    "first , the relative magnitudes of the nonlinearity and the external potential are adjusted in such a way that their effects cancel each other for a given cycle time @xmath4 ( this is not always possible ) .",
    "second , the recombination and/or reflection are conducted with optical pulses having different wavelength as compared to the splitting pulse to compensate for the change in the wave vectors of the moving clouds .",
    "finally , the recombination is carried out not at the nominal recombination time @xmath4 but at a time such that @xmath45 .",
