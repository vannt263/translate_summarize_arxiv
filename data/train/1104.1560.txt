    "time inhomogeneity leads to a great variety of behaviors . moreover , even in rather simple situations , we are at a loss to study how a time inhomogeneous markov chain might behave . here",

    "let @xmath3 be the invariant measure of @xmath4 .",
    "assume that , in a sense to be made precise , all @xmath4 and all @xmath3 are similar and the behavior of the time homogeneous chains driven by each @xmath4 separately is understood .",
    "can we then describe the behavior of the time inhomogeneous chain driven by the sequence @xmath1 ?    to give a concrete example , on @xmath5 ,",
    "consider a sequence of aperiodic irreducible birth and death chain kernels @xmath4 , @xmath6 with @xmath7 and with reversible measure @xmath3 satisfying @xmath8 , for all @xmath9 .",
    "what can we say about the behavior of the corresponding time inhomogeneous markov chain ?",
    "remarkably enough , there is very little known about this question .",
    "what can we expect to be true ?",
    "what can we try to prove ?",
    "let @xmath10 denote the distribution , after @xmath11 steps , of the time inhomogeneous chain described above started at @xmath12 .",
    "it is not hard to see that such a chain satisfies a doeblin type condition that implies @xmath13 in the absence of a true target distribution and following @xcite , we call this property _",
    "merging_. of course , this does not qualify as a quantitative result . extrapolating from the behavior of each kernel",
    "@xmath4 taken individually , we may hope to show that , if @xmath14 then @xmath15    the aim of this paper and the companion paper @xcite is to present techniques that apply to this type of problem .",
    "the simple minded problem outlined above is actually quite challenging and we will not be able to resolve it here without some additional hypotheses .",
    "however , we show how to adapt techniques such as singular values , nash and log - sobolev inequalities to time inhomogeneous chains and provide a variety of examples where these tools apply . in @xcite",
    ", we discussed singular value techniques . here , we focus on nash and log - sobolev inequalities .",
    "the examples treated here ( as well as those treated in @xcite ) are quite particular despite the fact that one may believe that the techniques we use are widely applicable . whether or not such a belief is warranted is a very interesting and , so far , unanswered question .",
    "this is deeply related to the notion of @xmath0-stability that is introduced here and in @xcite .",
    "the examples we present here and in @xcite are about the only existing evidence of successful quantitative analysis of time inhomogeneous markov chains .",
    "a more detailed introduction to these questions is in @xcite .",
    "the references @xcite discuss singular value techniques in the case of time inhomogeneous chains that admit an invariant distribution [ all kernels @xmath4 in the sequence @xmath16 share a common invariant distribution ] .",
    "time inhomogeneous random walks on finite groups provide a large collection of such examples ( see also @xcite for a particularly interesting example : semirandom transpositions ) .",
    "the papers @xcite are also concerned with quantitative results for time inhomogeneous markov chains . in particular , the techniques developed in @xcite are closely related to ours and we will use some of their results concerning the modified logarithmic sobolev inequality . references on the basic theory of time inhomogeneous markov chains are @xcite . for a different perspective , see also @xcite .    a short review of the relevant aspects of the time inhomogeneous markov chain literature , including the use of `` ergodic coefficients '' can be found in @xcite .",
    "the vast literature on the famous simulated annealing algorithm is not very relevant for our purpose but we refer to @xcite for a recent discussion .",
    "the paper @xcite concerned with filtering and genetic algorithms describes problems that are related in spirit to the present work .",
    "let @xmath2 be a finite set equipped with a sequence of kernels @xmath17 such that , for each @xmath11 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "an associated markov chain is a @xmath2-valued random process @xmath20 such that , for all @xmath11 , @xmath21 the distribution @xmath22 of @xmath23 is determined by the initial distribution @xmath24 and given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is defined inductively for each @xmath11 and each @xmath27 by @xmath28 with @xmath29 ( the identity ) .",
    "if we interpret the @xmath30 s as matrices , then this definition means that @xmath31 .",
    "this paper is mostly concerned with the behavior of the measures @xmath10 as @xmath11 tends to infinity . in the case of time homogeneous chains where all @xmath32 are equal ,",
    "we write @xmath33 .",
    "our main interest is in ergodic like properties of time inhomogeneous markov chains . in general",
    ", one does not expect @xmath34 to converge toward a limiting distribution .",
    "instead , the natural notion is that of merging of measures as discussed in @xcite .",
    "fix a sequence of markov kernels as above .",
    "we say the sequence is merging if for any @xmath35 , @xmath36    if the sequence @xmath16 is merging then , for any two starting distributions @xmath37 , the measures @xmath34 and @xmath38 are merging , that is , @xmath39 . since we assume the set @xmath2 is finite , merging is equivalent to @xmath40 . hence , we also refer to this property as `` total variation merging . ''",
    "total variation merging is also referred to as weak ergodicity in the literature and there exists a body of work concerned with understanding when weak ergodicity holds .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "a main tool used to show weak ergodicity is that of contraction coefficients .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite , birkhoff s contraction coefficient is used to study _ ratio ergodicity _ which is equivalent to what we will later call relative - sup merging .",
    "however , it should be noted that even for time homogeneous chains birkhoff coefficients and related methods fail to provide useful quantitative bounds in most cases .",
    "our goal is to develop quantitative results in the context of time inhomogeneous chains in the spirit of the work of aldous , diaconis and others . in these works ,",
    "precise estimates of the mixing time of ergodic chains are obtained .",
    "typically , a family of markov chains indexed by a parameter , say @xmath41 , is studied . loosely speaking , as the parameter @xmath41 increases , the complexity and size of the chain increases and one seeks bounds that depend on @xmath41 in an explicit quantitative way .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "efforts in this direction for time inhomogeneous chains are in @xcite .",
    "still , there are only a very small number of results and examples concerning the quantitative study of merging as defined above for time inhomogeneous markov chains so that it is not very clear what kind of results should be expected and what kind of hypotheses are reasonable .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more detailed discussion .",
    "the following definition is useful to capture the spirit of our study .",
    "it indicates that the simplest case we would like to think about is the case when the sequence @xmath4 is obtained by deterministic but arbitrary choices between a finite number of kernels @xmath42 .",
    "we say that a set @xmath43 of markov kernels on @xmath2 is merging in total variation if for any sequence @xmath44 with @xmath45 for all @xmath46 , we have @xmath47    in the study of ergodicity of finite markov chains , the convergence toward the target distribution is measured using various notions of distance between probability measures .",
    "these include the total variation distance @xmath48 the chi - square distance ( w.r.t .",
    "@xmath49 . note the asymmetry between @xmath50 and @xmath49 . ) @xmath51 and the relative sup - distance ( again , note the asymmetry ) @xmath52 these will be used here to measure merging .      in the quantitative theory of ergodic time homogeneous markov chains ,",
    "the notion of mixing time plays a crucial role . for time",
    "inhomogeneous chain , we propose to consider the following definitions .",
    "fix @xmath53 . given a sequence @xmath16 of markov kernels on a finite set @xmath2 ,",
    "we call max total variation merging time the quantity @xmath54    fix @xmath53 .",
    "we say that a set @xmath43 of markov kernels on @xmath2 has max total variation @xmath55-merging time at most @xmath56 if for any sequence @xmath1 with @xmath45 for all @xmath46 , we have @xmath57 , that is , @xmath58    of course , merging can be measured in ways other than total variation .",
    "also merging is a bit less flexible than mixing in this respect since there is no reference measure .",
    "one very natural and much stronger notion than total variation is relative sup - distance . for time",
    "inhomogeneous chains , total variation merging does not necessarily imply relative - sup merging as defined below .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we say a sequence @xmath16 of markov kernels on a finite set @xmath2 is merging in relative - sup if for all @xmath35 @xmath59 with the convention that @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
