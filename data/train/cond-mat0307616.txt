    "in the framework of classical mechanics , lattice dynamics can be treated through the equations of motion for the atoms . to determine the vibrational frequencies and the corresponding modes one needs to calculate the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the so - called dynamical matrix , which can be obtained from the interatomic interaction potential . if the dynamical matrix is known , the eigenvalue problem is straightforward , though only numerical solutions are available in many cases .",
    "numerous texts@xcite provide problems for the calculation of the vibrational modes in different crystal lattices . fortunately , there are some well - known examples  such as linear chains with / without bases , square and cubic lattices  in which analytical methods can be used @xcite .",

    "a short and necessary introduction of the lattice structure is presented .",
    "more details on crystal structures can be found in many books on solid - state physics@xcite .",
    "finally , in connection with the honeycomb lattice , the intensive research on nanotubes@xcite should be mentioned .",
