    "liquid xenon ( lxe ) has been used since many years ago for its good ionization properties @xcite , while applications based on its scintillation light are not fully developed until recently mostly due to inefficient detection of the uv scintillation light at 175 nm .",
    "some of the recent applications , based on the lxe scintillation light , are using photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) in the liquid ( e.g. meg experiment @xcite and the zeplin - iii detector @xcite ) or optical reflectors ( e.g. xmass experiment @xcite and the zeplin - ii detector @xcite ) to achieve high light collection efficiency . with the improved light collection , better energy resolution and lower energy threshold can be achieved .",
    "our group started to develop a new system with pmts immersed in the liquid and with ptfe uv light reflectors to increase the light collection efficiency @xcite , as part of the r&d program for the xenon dark matter search @xcite . in this paper , we report the studies of light yield and energy resolution from lxe scintillation light for different @xmath0-ray energies , from a small detector with optimized light collection efficiency .",
    "a picture of the detector s inner structure and a schematic drawing are shown in figure  [ chamber ] .",
    "the detector contains a gridded ionization structure , enclosed by a ptfe tube .",
    "it was designed for both ionization and scintillation measurements @xcite .",
    "two hamamatsu r9288 pmts are installed from the sides to detect the scintillation light . a blue led",
    "is mounted in the ptfe tube .",
    "the light from led goes through the ptfe wall and is detected by the pmts for gain calibration . for ionization measurement , three high optical transparent meshes , which serve as cathode , grid and anode , are used .",
    "the ionization electrons are detected by the anode mesh , which is connected to a charge sensitive preamplifier ( clear pulse model 580 ) .",
    "one additional shielding mesh is placed between the pmt and anode mesh to avoid induction between the pmt and the andoe charge signals .",
    "the 1.9 cm drift region between cathode and grid defines the liquid xenon sensitive volume for ionization measurement . for measurements of only scintillation light , as in this paper ,",
    "the whole volume of lxe between the two pmts are the sensitive target .",
    "the whole structure is immersed in liquid xenon during the experiment .",
    "the structure is mounted in a stainless steel vessel , surrounded by a vacuum cryostat for thermal insulation .",
    "the detector is filled with ultra - pure liquid xenon , purified through a saes high temperature getter . after filling the chamber with liquid xenon",
    ", the xenon is continuously circulated through the purification system , designed for the xenon dark matter search experiment ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details ) , to achieve the best xenon purity level . during the recirculation of xenon ,",
    "the light yield were monitored as a function of recirculation time and we saw no significant changes of light yield .",
    "this indicates that the attenuation of scintillation light in liquid xenon is much longer than the size of our chamber .",

    "the absorption and scattering lengths are much longer than the scale of our detector .",
    "the major uncertainty for calculating the light collection efficiency is from the ptfe reflectivity and mesh transparency . by varying the ptfe reflectivity between 88% and 95% and mesh transparency between 94% and 96% in the simulation , an overall light collection efficiency is estimated to be @xmath17 for events uniformly distributed in the lxe sensitive volume .",
