    "among many novel discoveries in the studies of relativistic heavy - ion physics , one of the remarkable facts is the presence of strong collective flows , which are well described using the ideal hydrodynamic model generalhydro . in this sense , hydrodynamics is expected to be an important tool to investigate the properties of the qcd matter . if such a scenario is established , we may further use the hydrodynamic model to infer the initial condition just after the collision from the final state observables . however , there are still several open questions in the hydrodynamic description of relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite and more extensive studies are necessary .",
    "the effect of dissipation is one of such problems .",
    "the effect of shear viscosity in heavy ion collisions has been investigated by several authors romatschke1,heinzetal , heinzsong1,heinzsong2,chaudhuri , pasi , teany , and it was found that the elliptic flow parameter @xmath2 can be significantly affected . on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of bulk viscosity has not been analyzed in detail yet . roughly speaking , while the shear viscosity acts as the resistance against the deformation of a fluid element , the bulk viscosity acts against the expansion or compression of the fluid .",
    "thus , one may naturally expect that shear viscosity affects directly @xmath2 , which characterizes the spatial anisotropy of the dynamics .",
    "however , this does not mean that the bulk viscosity plays a secondary role .",
    "because of the anisotropic expansion and compression of the produced matter , the bulk viscosity should alter the anisotropic flow as well .",
    "another important factor is the behavior of the bulk viscosity coefficient , @xmath6 , near the qcd phase transition temperature @xmath7 .",
    "recently , lattice qcd simulations @xcite suggest that @xmath8 is strongly enhanced near @xmath7 , although the shear viscosity coefficient is suppressed @xcite",
    ". a similar enhancement will appear even below @xmath9 , as is shown in @xcite , where @xmath8 in the hadronic phase increases also quickly towards @xmath7 .",
    "considering the fact that the fluid dynamics slows down near @xmath7 due to the small sound velocity @xmath10 , the critical behavior of @xmath8 discussed above may play a crucial role on @xmath2 .",
    "as far as we know , the effect of the bulk viscosity on @xmath2 was calculated in @xcite where the effect of the phase transition is also considered . as a matter of fact ,",
    "a quantitative estimate of the effect of the phase transition in dissipative hydrodynamics is not straightforward because the above critical behavior of the bulk viscosity should be consistently constructed with the equation of state ( eos ) .    as a reliable eos",
    ", the first choice would be the results of the lattice qcd calculation for the qgp phase and of the hadron resonance gas for the hadron phase .",
    "however , the connection of these two eos s is not trivial because no reliable information is available near @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , @xmath10 near @xmath9 is very sensitive to the way that the two phases are connected and it is important to check how these ambiguities influence @xmath2 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of bulk viscosity on the elliptic flow within a 2 + 1 dimensional hydrodynamic modeling , incorporating the critical behaviors from @xmath10 and @xmath8 near @xmath7 .",
    "as was pointed out already @xcite , @xmath2 is affected  also  by the dissipative corrections on the one - particle distribution function at the freeze - out .",
    "however , we will not consider these corrections in this work because the 14 moments approximation , which is the method commonly employed to evaluate this correction , is inapplicable for the freeze - out values of bulk viscosity , as we will discuss later .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we briefly review the equations of causal dissipative hydrodynamics in the hyperbolic coordinate system and present the sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) parameterization for the numerical implementation . in section [ sec3 ] , we set up the parameters of our calculation , such as the initial condition , the eos and the transport coefficients .",
    "we futher discuss the freeze - out process and show the intrinsic problem of the 14 moments approximation .",
    "the numerical results for the effects of bulk viscosity on @xmath2 are given in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "as is well known , the application of dissipative hydrodynamics in the relativistic regime requires some caution .",
    "recently , it became clear that the instability of the hydrodynamic model can be induced by the violation of relativistic causality @xcite .",
    "thus , the relativistic navier - stokes ( landau - lifshitz ) theory @xcite is essentially unstable and not applicable for the complex systems generated in the relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "several formulations of relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics have been proposed so far to solve the problem of acausality and instability @xcite .    in this work , we will use the memory function method @xcite .",
    "this theory is formulated in such a way that the magnitude of the bulk viscosity has naturally a lower bound and we can carry out stable numerical simulations even for ultra - relativistic initial conditions . here , we present the basic equations of this formalism in the hyperbolic coordinate system .    for simplicity , we consider the case of vanishing baryon chemical potential where only the conservation of the energy and momentum is required . for a general metric @xmath11 , we have @xmath12where @xmath13 is the christoffel symbol and @xmath14 is the determinant of @xmath11 .",
    "we use the landau definition for the local rest frame and assume , as usual , that the thermodynamic relations are valid in this frame . in this work , we further ignore the shear viscosity . then , the energy - momentum tensor is expressed as @xmath15where , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the energy density , pressure , four velocity and bulk viscosity , respectively .    as was discussed in @xcite , one of the important factors to obtain a stable causal dissipative hydrodynamics is to consider the deformation of the fluid element in the hydrodynamic flow .",
    "we introduce a reference density @xmath20 defined by@xmath21where @xmath22 is the expansion rate of a fluid element and @xmath23 denotes the covariante derivative .",
    "the above relation can also be expressed in the form of a continuity equation for @xmath20 , @xmath24    the equation for the entropy production is written as , @xmath25where @xmath26 is the entropy density . from this",
    ", we can define the thermodynamic force @xmath27 associated with the bulk viscosity as @xmath28 . in the memory function method ,",
    "an irreversible current @xmath29 is induced by the thermodynamic force as @xmath30thus , the equation for the bulk viscosity is obtained by setting @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and can be expressed in a differential form as follows @xmath33where @xmath34 is the relaxation time",
    ".    in hyperbolic coordinates eqs .",
    "( [ conserv ] ) , ( [ entrop_conserv ] ) and ( [ generalbulk ] ) are explicitly given by @xmath35    in this case @xmath36,where @xmath37and @xmath38 .",
    "the three equations above are solved in the following calculations .",
    "to solve numerically the relativistic hydrodynamic equations , we use the smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) method @xcite .",
    "see dkkm3,dkkm4,sph - heavy ion for the application to the heavy ion dynamics . for the sake of book keeping , here we just write down explicitly the sph equations in hyperbolic coordinates leaving the detailed derivation to the references above .    in the sph method ,",
    "all the hydrodynamic variables are expressed in terms of a discrete set of lagrangian coordinates @xmath39 together with a normalized kernel function @xmath40 for the smoothing procedure .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 represents the width of @xmath42 and serves as a cut - off parameter for short wavelength modes . for hyperbolic coordinates ,",
    "this kernel function takes the form @xmath43with @xmath44where the two width parameters , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , are introduced separately for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "the basic procedure of the sph scheme is to express a reference density @xmath49 and its current @xmath50 * * , * * where @xmath51 is the lorentz factor , as@xmath52so that the continuity equation ( [ volume ] ) is automatically satisfied @xcite .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and ( [ current ] ) can be interpreted as if there are particles associated with each lagrangian coordinate @xmath53 , with velocity @xmath54 , carrying a quantity @xmath55 for the reference density @xmath56 .",
    "these particles are called sph particles .",
    "the following calculation is independent of the choice of @xmath57 and , hence , we set @xmath58 .    the dynamic variables in the sph scheme are then,@xmath59where they represent , respectively , position , velocity , entropy , and bulk viscosity associated with the @xmath60-th sph particle .",
    "the time evolution of these variables can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ motion ] ) , ( entrop_motion ) and ( [ pi ] ) by expressing them in the sph representation . writing the entropy density @xmath26 and the bulk viscosity @xmath19 as @xmath61we obtain the equation for the bulk viscosity of the @xmath60-th sph particle @xmath62and the equation of motion eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) @xcite @xmath63the r.h.s . of eq.([motionsph ] ) is nothing but the sph representation of the gradients of pressure and bulk viscosity .",
    "we remark that the l.h.s . of eq.([motionsph ] ) contains an implicit velocity dependence through the lorentz factor @xmath64 in the thermodynamic variables . after some straightforward manipulations , we get @xmath65with@xmath66and@xmath67 in the above equations , we calculated the four divergence of the velocity as @xmath68and , from the continuity equation , @xmath69    as mentioned in the introduction , we study the transverse dynamics near the central rapidity region , assuming the bjorken scaling behavior in @xmath70 , that is , @xmath71",
    ". then the dynamics is restricted on the transverse plane and is simplified as @xmath72with@xmath73these are the sph representations of our equations which will be solved .",
    "one of the central issues of hydrodynamical simulations of relativistic heavy - ion collisions is to infer what are the real initial conditions attained in the instant of the collision .",

    "the impact parameter is chosen as @xmath88 @xmath86 .",
    "we consider three different eos s ; one for an ideal gas of massless quarks and the other two corresponding to different connections between the qgp and hadron gas phases , as shown in fig .",
    "the dash - dotted line corresponds to the ideal massless quark gas , which we refer to as eos i. the dotted line ( eos ii ) and solid line ( eos iii ) are both constructed by connecting the eos from lattice qcd calculations with three flavors for the qgp phase @xcite and that of the hadron resonance gas for the hadron phase .",
    "however , as was mentioned in the introduction , it is not well established how the lattice eos is connected to that of the hadron resonance gas eos . in eos",
    "ii the two phases are connected smoothly for a wide interpolation domain of the temperature , @xmath89 mev , whereas in eos iii the connetion is done within a narrower interpolation domain , @xmath90 mev ( see connectioneos for the connection method ) .",
    "thus , compared with the eos ii , the eos iii is more faithful , both to the lattice qcd and the hadronic resonance gas values except in a narrow transition region near @xmath91 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "since the connection is rather abrupt , a kink - like structure appears at the qcd phase transition .        .",
    "the dotted and solid lines represent eos ii and eos iii , respectively .",

    "the temperature dependence of the pressure and @xmath10 are shown in figs .",
    "[ eos ] and [ sound ] , respectively .",
    "one can see that , although the behavior of the pressure is not drastically modified , @xmath10 is still  very sensitive to the choice of connection ; @xmath10 in eos iii has a narrow minimum reaching a much smaller value than that of eos ii .",
    "the nature of the transition of eos iii is almost that of the first order phase transition .",
    "if the transition were of first order , @xmath10 would vanish at the phase transition .",
    "since the acceleration of the fluid is directly related to @xmath92 , this difference would affect significantly the hydrodynamic evolution of the system near the phase transition .",
    "thus , we perform a comparative study of the behavior of @xmath2 calculated using these equations of state .",
    "the behavior of the transport coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath93 has not yet been established .",
    "there are several approaches to calculate transport coefficients .",
    "a well - known method is to use the green - kubo - nakano ( gkn ) formula .",
    "exactly speaking , the validity of the gkn formula is , however , not clear in the relativistic regime since it was developed for newtonian fluids .",
    "recently it has been shown that even in the presence of memory effects , the viscosity coefficients coincide with those of the gkn formula , at least , in the leading order approximation @xcite . here",
    ", we use the result from lattice qcd @xcite , calculated with the gkn formula , for the qgp phase . for the hadron phase",
    ", we use the result obtained recently by @xcite .",
    "then , the bulk viscosity coefficient shows a maximum at @xmath9 and starts to decrease almost exponentially as the system departs from this critical region .",
    "the coefficient vanishes in the high temperature limit in the qgp phase whereas in the low temperature limit ( hadronic gas ) , it converges to a finite value .",
    "we fitted these results by analytic expressions and connected them by a parabola around @xmath94 mev .",

    "the circles and squares denote the result obtained from lattice qcd calculation and the hadron resonance gas , respectively . ]     and @xmath109 , respectively . ]      from extensive studies of the shear viscosity , it is known that there are two different origins for the dissipative corrections to the elliptic flow .",
    "one is the effect of viscosity on the collective evolution of the fluid itself .",
    "the other is the correction to the one - particle distribution function at the freeze - out hyper surface .",
    "it was shown that the latter correction is more important than the former for the shear viscosity heinzsong1,teany .    the correction to the one - particle distribution function",
    "is usually estimated using grad s 14 moments approximation .",
    "however , the applicability of this approach to the heavy - ion scenario is not so obvious . in the following",

    "[ dist ] . in our simulations",
    ", the typical value of the bulk viscosity at the freeze - out hyper surface reaches @xmath124@xmath125 , which means that @xmath126 is much bigger than @xmath127 itself .",
    "then , the corrected one - particle distribution function @xmath128 can be even negative .",
    "the negative corrections come from the normalization conditions , eqs .",
    "( [ cond4 ] ) and ( [ cond5 ] ) , which imply that @xmath129    obviously , the 14 moments approximation is consistent only when @xmath126 is much smaller than the equilibrium distribution function @xmath127 .",
    "that is , the magnitude of bulk viscosity @xmath19 should be , at least , smaller than @xmath130 @xmath125 at the freeze - out for pions .",
    "this value of bulk viscosity is very small and corresponds only to @xmath131 of the value of pressure of a hadron resonance gas at @xmath132 mev .",
    "usually , the procedure of freeze - out in hydrodynamics does not impose any constraint on the magnitude of the bulk viscosity and it is not clear that such small values of viscosity will be achieved .",
    "for example , in our simulations , the value of the ratio between the bulk viscosity and the pressure is around @xmath133 , which seems to be a small correction but is already too large for the 14 moments approximation .",
    "this situation is unchanged even for heavier particles ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "one may notice that grad s method was originally formulated for a single component fluid and , to discuss the appropriate correction to the one - particle distribution function , we have to generalize it to a multiple component fluid .",
    "thus , one might argue that if we consider the multi - component fluid the limitation discussed above might be relaxed . in this case , each hadronic species can have its own bulk viscosity and pressure , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , where@xmath137here the index @xmath138  represents the different hadronic species . in the context of the first order theory",

    "furthermore , it should be noted that the generalization of the 14 moments method to a multiple component fluid is not trivial , neither unique .",
    "there are several different solutions proposed @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the applicability of the 14 moments approximation is not clear in heavy - ion collisions .",

    "[ shockwave ] , the temperature distribution calculated with eos ii at @xmath167 fm is shown .",

    "one can easily see that , for the viscous case , the behavior of the fluid flow is not monotone in the region where @xmath10 has its minimum .",
    "this is because the flow of the internal matter , which has a higher temperature , tends to catch up the foregoing fluid elements , generating a non - monotonous velocity field in the radial direction .",
    "this behavior of the velocity field causes the bulk viscosity @xmath19 to become piled up , which heats the matter in this region .",
    "if this happens , the gradient of @xmath19 becomes dominant in the acceleration of the fluid compared to the pressure gradient ( note that the acceleration is given by @xmath168 ) since the gradient of the pressure is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "such a mechanism works more efficiently in the direction where the initial acceleration is large , and in consequence , in the direction to increase the elliptic flow .",
    "furthermore , this effect becomes effective only when significant collective flow is formed near the phase transition .",
    "thus , the recovery of @xmath2 by this mechanism is expected for higher momentum particles .",
    "we consider that this is the reason for the counter - intuitive behavior of our result . of course one",

    "@xmath2 decreases by a factor of @xmath3 at low @xmath0 ( @xmath4 gev ) .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath0 ( @xmath5 gev ) , the interplay between @xmath175 and @xmath164 near the qcd  phase transition generates more collective flow , with even larger values than those of the ideal fluid . these effects can depend on the value of the transport coefficient @xmath108 when the phase transition is more abrupt . of course one",
    "should keep in mind that the applicability of the hydrodynamic approach is not guaranteed for the high @xmath0 dynamics , but this is an interesting feature and deserves further investigation .",
    "all the calculations of @xmath2 here were done without dissipative corrections to the one - particle distribution function . as discussed in this paper , the naive application of the usual 14 moment calculation for the bulk viscosity leads to unacceptable values for the corrections to the distribution function .",
    "it should be noted that the 14 moments approximation is not an unique choice to solve grad s method and there are other approaches to calculate the non - equilibrium distribution function @xcite . it may be possible that the problem presented here can be solved using alternative approaches .",
    "further investigation on this aspect is required urgently .    although not explored in the present paper , one interesting aspect observed in these studies",
    "should be mentioned . for much larger values of @xmath164 ,",
    "say @xmath176 , and smaller @xmath108 ( @xmath177 ) , we found some peculiar behavior of @xmath2 at large @xmath0 , exhibiting large fluctuations for small changes in the transport coefficients .",
    "we identified that such fluctuations are related to the emergence of instabilities in the fluid evolution and that they are amplified when a sharp phase transition ( such as a first order phase transition ) is present .",
    "we also found that these instabilities can not be controlled even after introducing the additional viscosity discussed in @xcite .",
    "although the shear viscosity was not considered here , we believe that these instabilities are an intrinsic phenomenon that appears for large bulk viscosity dynamics , such as the burgers instabilities @xcite . if this is true , they should reflect in the observed @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , the event - by - event fluctuations in @xmath2 would become very large at high @xmath178 .",
    "since this effect is closely related to the nature of the phase transition , it would be interesting to verify this experimentally .",
    "we acknowledge illuminating discussions from t. hirano and a. monnai and thank j. noronha for constructive comments on the manuscript .",

    "in this appendix , we discuss the grad s method with the 14 moments approximation @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the non - equilibrium one - particle distribution function is assumed as @xmath179where the parameters @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 represent the deviation from equilibrium up to second order in momentum and @xmath183 is @xmath184 for bosons , @xmath185 for fermions and @xmath186 for a boltzmann gas .",
    "the index 0 is applied for the quantities in equilibrium . without loss of generality @xmath187",
    "is assumed to be traceless,@xmath188      for a rarefied gas , the conserved number current and the energy - momentum tensor are expressed as @xmath191substituting eq .",
    "( [ distribution function ] ) into them , we have @xmath192where,@xmath193the 0-th order terms are identified as the equilibrium currents , @xmath194all the remaining terms come from the dissipative corrections . the moments ( [ moments ] )",
    "can be expanded as @xmath195where @xmath196    in hydrodynamics , the dissipative corrections in the currents are parameterized in terms of the bulk viscosity , the shear viscosity and the heat conductivity .",
    "the variables @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath197 can be determined in terms of these hydrodynamic variables with the following set of constraints @xmath198    the first three relations define the irreversible currents while the last two restrictions come from the landau choice for the local equilibrium reference frame . if we were using the eckart frame , for example , we would have to use , instead of ( [ cond4 ] ) and ( [ cond5 ] ) , @xmath199    the conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) , ( [ cond2 ] ) and ( [ cond3 ] ) imply , @xmath200a general solution can be constructed using the following _ ansatz _ , @xmath201 in order to know the form of the one - particle distribution function ( distribution function ) , we have to determine the form of the coefficients @xmath202 , @xmath119 , @xmath203 , @xmath121 , @xmath204 and @xmath114 .",
    "this can be done by substituting these general solutions into the equations discussed above,@xmath205    the first three equations , ( [ constr1 ] ) , ( [ constr2 ] ) and ( constr3 ) , come directly from ( [ from_cond_1 ] ) , ( [ from_cond_2 ] ) and ( [ from_cond_3 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the last three equations , ( [ constr4 ] ) , ( [ constr5 ] ) , and ( [ constr6 ] ) , are consequences of eqs .",
