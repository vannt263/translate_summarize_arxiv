    "in seeking to understand any role that agn winds might play in the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies , we need to study the physical properties of those winds at z  @xmath0  2 where star formation and black hole growth were at their height .",
    "it is probable that the majority of mass and energy carried in agn winds is transported by the x - ray absorbing part of the outflow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as the x - ray absorber has the highest column density , at least in nearby agn , but it is usually difficult to obtain satisfactory x - ray spectra from high - redshift agn .",
    "the most well - known population of distant agn showing evidence of ionised winds is the broad absorption line quasars ( balqsos ; z  @xmath0",
    "0.1@xmath46 ) , whose winds have outflow speeds of up to 60000 km  s@xmath5 , with line - of - sight absorbing columns of @xmath6 @xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) causing the soft x - ray band to be highly absorbed ( see  e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "*  and  references  therein ) .",
    "the vast majority of x - ray observations of balqsos have been follow@xmath4ups after their discovery in optical surveys , and most of the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations of balqsos , with the exception of lbqs  2212 - 1759 @xcite and apm  08279 + 5255 @xcite , have been short snapshots .",
    "our knowledge of the x - ray properties of balqsos is therefore based upon a small number of the very brightest optically - selected sources ; the largest relevant samples to date have been published by @xcite .    recently a number of x - ray selected balqsos ( xbalqsos ) have also come to light ( page  et  al . ,  in  preparation ;",
    "we use the abbreviation xbalqsos to refer to serendipitously discovered x - ray sources whose balqso nature has been revealed by follow@xmath4up optical spectroscopic observations . it is unknown whether these represent a distinct section of the balqso population . since the x - ray faintness of balqsos is probably due to absorption by the wind , the relative x - ray brightness of xbalqsos could be due to their winds causing less absorption , through either having lower absorbing columns or higher ionisation parameters ; xbalqsos could also conceivably be exceptionally luminous balqsos with high dust extinction in the optical .",
    "there is also the possibility that their intrinsic continua simply have a higher ratio of x - ray to optical flux .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the properties of five xbalqsos discovered in two deep x - ray survey fields : four objects in the 1@xmath7 survey field and one in the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) .",
    "we begin by comparing the x - ray and optical fluxes , and x - ray to optical spectral indices ( @xmath3 ) of the sources to those of the largest available uniformly - analysed sample of obalqsos observed to date in the x - ray @xcite .",
    "we then investigate whether the intrinsic extinction in the xbalqsos differs from that in the @xcite sample and from qsos from the sdss @xcite . in section  [ dynamics ] , we compare the extent of intrinsic uv absorption in the xbalqsos with that in the @xcite sample of obalqsos from the sdss . next , in section  [ xray_wind_properties ] we obtain estimates of the absorbing columns and ionisation parameters of the x - ray absorbing winds of the xbalqsos , comparing the results with those of similar analyses of obalqsos in the literature .",
    "we then provide estimates of the mass - energy budgets of the xbalqsos and their x - ray absorbing winds .",
    "finally we discuss the nature of these xbalqsos , and the implications for the population of faint balqsos discoverable in deep x - ray surveys .",
    "names , positions and basic parameters of these sources are given in table  [ source_properties ] . throughout this paper , the objects are referred to by the abbreviations xbq1 - 5 ( x - ray selected broad absorption line quasars 1 to 5 ) , as identified in table  [ source_properties ] .",
    "we use a cosmology with h@xmath8=70  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 , @xmath9=0.3 , and @xmath10=0.7 , and all uncertainties are 1@xmath11 unless otherwise stated .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "our goal in this paper was to investigate the x - ray and optical properties of a group of x - ray selected balqsos discovered in deep x - ray survey fields , and in particular to see whether they had been discoverable in such surveys due to having unusual spectral properties .",
    "as we showed in section  [ fluxes_alpha_ox ] , the xbalqsos have , on average , slightly higher x - ray to optical flux ratios than the largest available comparable sample of obalqsos @xcite .",
    "this is probably not a result of intrinsic source variability .",
    "it is equally possible that all five sources would happen to be especially x - ray faint as x - ray bright when we observed them , and if variability was a major factor , we would expect to see a mixture of high and low @xmath3 values among the xbalqsos .",
    "we can also immediately discard the possibility that the flatter @xmath3 is due to the xbalqsos being intrinsically very luminous balqsos which happen to have high rest - frame optical extinction ; as we showed in section  [ extinction_properties ] , their @xmath12 colours as a function of redshift are entirely consistent with the obalqso population . given the very low space density of luminous qsos on the sky , it is also highly unlikely that we should have found four such objects serendipitously in a single 30  diameter field",
    ".    if xbalqsos are brighter than expected in the x - rays due to having less intrinsic x - ray absorption than optically selected sources , the ionised x - ray absorbing winds should have lower n@xmath13 and/or higher @xmath14 than those in comparable obalqsos . in fig .",
    "[ xray_properties_avg ] we compare total absorbing column and ( weighted average , where necessary ) ionisation parameter with these quantities in obalqsos from the literature , as well as from a sample of lower redshift seyfert galaxies and qsos with ionised soft x - ray absorbers which we have studied previously @xcite .",
    "the obalqsos were pg1115 + 080 @xcite , q1246 - 057 , sbs 1542 + 541 @xcite , and pg2112 + 059 @xcite .",
    "we find that , on the contrary , these xbalqsos have similar or even perhaps greater intrinsic absorption than the obalqsos .",
    "testing whether that is a general feature of xbalqsos would require a larger sample of sources .",
    "the amount of absorption from the uv - absorbing part of the wind , as measured by the bi , is consistent with the distribution of bi for obalqsos in the sdss , although there is again some indication that they are towards the more highly absorbed end of the distribution .",
    "the mass - energy transport of the winds , which we estimated in section  [ mass_energy_budget ] , ranges quite widely . for xbq5 , which has the best - constrained values , mass outflow rate via the x - ray absorbing part of the wind is @xmath0",
    "0.04@xmath410 times the mass accretion rate onto its black hole , and the kinetic luminosity of the wind is @xmath0  0.002@xmath40.3% of the bolometric luminosity .",
    "a complete picture of the mass - energy budget of the wind would require consideration of the mass - energy output via the uv - absorbing part of the wind , which is beyond the scope of this paper , and taking account of the full ionisation range of the wind , which would require far better data .",
    "regarding the nature of xbalqsos , we are left with the conclusion that , although they are fundamentally similar to the wider population of obalqsos , they may belong to a part of the balqso population with an intrinsically higher x - ray to optical flux ratio .",
    "this is actually what we would expect for agn as uv - faint as our xbalqsos , since , according to the @xcite relation , for example , agn with lower restframe 2500    luminosities should have flatter @xmath3 indices .",
    "the implication of this is that , as hard x - ray surveys get deeper , there should be a lot of faint xbalqso - type agn waiting to be discovered .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the xbalqso @xmath3 values do in fact exactly follow the @xcite relation ; our xbalqsos do not span sufficient luminosity space for us to attempt an answer to that question .",
    "investigating this point will require many more sources over a range of luminosities , with sufficient x - ray counts for a reliable estimation of the unabsorbed x - ray flux to be made .",
