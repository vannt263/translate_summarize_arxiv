    "free standing graphene , the only presently known mono - atomic two - dimensional crystal @xcite , should be an ideal tethered membrane , i.e. a membrane made up of constituents with a fixed connectivity that give rise to a finite shear modulus of the membrane .",
    "tethered membranes are known to have highly unusual properties , such as the absence of any finite elastic constants in the thermodynamic limit , a negative poisson ratio , and fluctuations characterized by a large anomalous dimension @xmath0 in the infra - red ( ir ) limit @xcite .",
    "experiments have not yet probed the large wavelength regime to test these predictions , however a negative poisson ratio and anomalous fluctuations have been seen in monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of graphene based on an realistic effective many - body interaction of c - atoms @xcite .",

    "while it was often argued that these ripples are not compatible with the standard continuum elastic theory of tethered membranes @xcite , we demonstrate below that they emerge naturally from it .",
    "since ripples are a finite scale phenomenon , this requires to go beyond the asymptotic regime which was investigated in previous theoretical investigations . here",
    ", we present the most thorough rg treatment of tethered membranes yet , a non - perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) analysis of tethered membranes which is based on the expansion of the effective action in terms of elastic coupling _ functions _ which for the first time allows to extract the full momentum dependence of thermal fluctuations .",
    "excellent agreement with mc simulations of free standing graphene is found .",
    "ripples emerge as the real space analog of the ginzburg scale , which is the crossover scale which seperates the anomalous regime from the perturbative one .",
    "we further calculate the anomalous dimension both in the flat phase and at the crumpling transition which is found to be of second order .",
    "in contrast to fluid membranes which are always crumpled ( the average of the normal of the surface vanishes ) the finite shear modulus stabilizes a flat phase with long range order of the normals @xcite and the normal - normal correlation function @xmath2 decays asymptotically for small momenta @xmath3 as @xmath4 , see refs .",
    "the flat phase is stable for @xmath5 and in fact all calculations yield a large anomalous dimension , varying between @xmath6 from a large @xmath7 expansion for @xmath8-dimensional membranes embedded in @xmath7-dimensional space @xcite , @xmath9 from the self - consistent screening approximation @xcite and @xmath10 where the last result was obtained both from nprg @xcite as well as from mc simulations of graphene @xcite .",

    "note that if one ignores terms of third and fourth order in @xmath46 and keeps derivatives of @xmath46 only up to second order , one finds , after a rescaling @xcite @xmath47 , the minimal model for a flat membrane @xcite , @xmath48 $ ] with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",

    "the most important scale in the analysis of the momentum dependence of the membrane fluctuations is the ginzburg scale which we find to be of the same order as the experimentally determined characteristic size of ripples .",
    "the observation of ripples at this scale should thus be looked at as a confirmation of the continuum elastic theory of tethered membranes , a notion which could also be tested experimentally by measuring the characteristic ripple scale as a funtion of temperature .",
