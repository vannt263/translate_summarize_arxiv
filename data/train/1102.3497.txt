    "a low frequency electromagnetic wave has been investigated as a fundamental normal mode of unmagnetized inhomogeneous plasmas .",
    "the ion acoustic wave ( iaw ) is a well - known low frequency mode of unmagnetized plasmas but it is purely electrostatic . even for lightest ions of hydrogen",
    "the electron to ion mass ratio is very small @xmath3 . in the limit @xmath4 ,",
    "the electrons are assumed to follow the boltzmann density distribution in the electrostatic field of the iaw .",
    "+ in fact the electron inertia can play a vital role in producing a low frequency electromagnetic wave .",
    "more than a decade ago @xcite , it was proposed that an electromagnetic wave having frequency near iaw is a normal mode of unmagnetized plasmas which can be responsible for magnetic field generation if it becomes unstable . in the derivation of its linear dispersion relation",
    "the electron inertia was not ignored while the displacement current was neglected .",
    "it was shown that the compressibility and vorticity can couple due to density inhomogeneity and hence a low frequency electromagnetic wave can be produced .",
    "basically electrostatic iaw and magnetostatic mode @xcite cooperate with each other to develop such a wave .",
    "the electron temperature perturbation was not taken into account and the steady state was assumed to be maintained by external mechanisms .",
    "the theory was applied to explain the magnetic field generation in laser plasmas .",
    "but the longitudinal and transverse characters of electric field decouple if the quasi - neutrality is used @xcite",
    ". then both the high frequency and low frequency electromagnetic instabilities were also investigated in unmagnetized plasmas @xcite .",
    "+ the interest in the investigation of low frequency magnetic fluctuations in unmagnetized plasmas was initiated after the first experimental observation of magnetic field generated in a laser induced plasma @xcite .",
    "then more experiments were performed @xcite on these lines .",
    "several theoretical models were presented to explain the magnetic field generation in laser produced plasmas @xcite .",
    "+ the magnetic electron drift vortex ( medv ) mode was proposed as a pure transverse linear mode which can exist because of the electron temperature fluctuations in unmagnetized inhomogeneous electron plasmas @xcite .",
    "this mode can become unstable @xcite if the equilibrium electron temperature gradient is parallel to the density gradient and it is maintained by external effects .",
    "the basic medv mode is believed to exist in an electron plasma with smooth gradients .",
    "however , it has also been shown that the instability of medv mode can arise when the density profile is represented by a single step connecting two regions of nonzero density and temperature gradients @xcite .",
    "the instabilities of magnetic and acoustic waves driven by perturbed baroclinic vector have also been investigated in a pure electron plasma @xcite .",
    "recently the nonlinear evolution of two dimentsional medv modes has been studied using computer simulation @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous magnetic field generation and formation of nonlinear structures has been discussed in detail .",
    "most of the mechanisms proposed to explain magnetic fluctuations in initially unmagnetized plasmas are based on electron magnetohydrodynamics ( emhd ) which has been discussed in detail in refs .",
    "some weaknesses and contradictions of emhd model were pointed out several years ago @xcite .",
    "the long - lived and slowly propagating nonlinear whistler structures ( nlws ) or whistler spheromaks ( wsps ) have also been studied @xcite using emhd equations .",
    "such structures have been observed in magnetized laboratory plasmas @xcite .",
    "+ in medv mode the divergence of electric field is assumed to be zero @xmath5 while the divergence of electron velocity is non - zero @xmath6 . furthermore the ions are treated to be stationary .",
    "the frequency @xmath7 of the medv mode is assumed to lie in between the ion plasma frequency and electron plasma frequency i.e. @xmath8 where @xmath9 , for j = e , i and c is speed of light while k is the wave vector .",
    "these restrictions and assumptions are indeed very strict @xcite and are not fulfilled in general .",
    "+ several authors have considered the role of ion dynamics in the magnetic instabilities in unmagnetized plasmas .",
    "the effects of ion dynamics on medv mode have been investigated in the frame work of local approximation @xcite .",
    "the coupling of high frequency electromagnetic wave with low frequency ion acoustic wave has been discussed in certain limits @xcite .",
    "the coupling of magnetic fluctuations with ion acoustic wave has been discussed in a plasma with the steady state given as @xmath10 @xcite without considering electron temperature perturbation .",
    "but the group velocity turns out to be negative in this treatment . + it is important to find out some electromagnetic mode taking into account the ion dynamics using minimum approximations so that the strict restrictions on the frequency and wavelength of the perturbation are relaxed",
    ". it is better if the only required condition on frequency becomes @xmath11 .",
    "if we assume a steady state as @xmath10 , then the temperature gradient becomes anti - parallel to density .",
    "but laser and astrophysical plasmas are open systems and many external mechanisms can maintain a study state with parallel density and temperature gradients .",
    "for example , in stellar cores , both the density and temperature increase towards centre of the star due to fusion and star is held intact because of gravity . therefore both the cases of parallel and anti - parallel gradients should be discussed .",
    "the electron thermal fluctuations can produce electromagnetic wave as was proposed many decades ago @xcite but the assumptions used in this work are very restrictive . + it is not necessary to assume a pure transverse perturbation in an electron plasma .",
    "rather the perturbation can be partially transverse and partially longitudinal and hence the electron density perturbation may not be neglected .",
    "the frequency of such a wave in electron plasma turns out to be near @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electron thermal speed , @xmath14 is the electron skin depth and @xmath15 is the inverse of density gradient scale length @xmath16 . in the local approximation",
    "we need to have @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore the condition @xmath18 can be satisfied if @xmath19 . therefore , generally we may have @xmath20 and hence one can not neglect ion dynamics .",
    "moreover , @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is ion sound speed ) is also possible .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the electron thermal fluctuations can couple with iaw to produce stable and unstable low frequency electromagnetic waves in unmagnetized plasmas .",
    "it will be shown that the dispersion relation of ion acoustic wave is modified in the inhomogeneous plasma due to the coupling of electrostatic and magnetic fluctuations . a low frequency electrostatic mode can do also exist in a non - uniform pure electron plasma .",
    "this mode can couple with the iaw in electron - ion plasma .",
    "several low frequency electrostatic and electromagnetic waves of inhomogeneous unmagnetized electron and electron - ion plasmas are investigated .",

    "first we discuss the dispersion relation of pure transverse medv mode @xcite .",
    "then we show that the compressibility can not be neglected .",

    "it is interesting to note that equation ( 22 ) can be simplified to obtain , @xmath83 which looks very similar to medv mode dispersion relation .",
    "+ however , the instability condition for this electromagnetic mode is the same as was for medv mode that is @xmath84 the low frequency mode ( 23 ) is partially transverse and partially longitudinal .",

    "we have to use poisson equation to obtain a quadratic equation in @xmath7 while ( 2 ) implies @xmath99 .",

    "if the displacement current is retained and poisson equation is used without using @xmath102 , then one obtains a dispersion relation of coupled three waves ; ion acoustic wave , electron plasma wave and high frequency transverse wave @xcite .",
    "+ actually the contribution of displacement current in the curl of maxwell s equation has been neglected for @xmath103 .",
    "this should not mean that the electrostatic part of current is also divergence free , in our opinion .",
    "in the divergence part of maxwell s equation @xmath92 is used but @xmath94 term is assumed to be important . it may be mentioned that in this treatment , ampere s law does not imply quasi - neutrality necessarily .",

    "now we present a simple but interesting theoretical model for low frequency electromagnetic waves assuming ions to be cold .",
    "the electrostatic waves will also be considered and it will be shown that magnetic field perturbation is coupled with the dominant electrostatic field . in the low frequency limit @xmath106 ,",

    "it is assumed that @xmath108 while electron equation of motion yields boltzmann density distribution as @xmath109 then the fundamental low frequency mode of the plasma turns out to be the ion acoustic wave with linear dispersion relation @xmath110 in the quasi - neutrality limit .",
    "if dispersion effects are included , then instead of ( 31 ) one obtains , @xmath111 in the limit @xmath112 , equation ( 32 ) gives ion plasma oscillations @xmath113 .",

    "2 . + the instability can occur if ( 24 ) is satisfied along with @xmath133         +",
    "the theoretical model presented here shows that several electrostatic and electromagnetic low frequency waves can exist in un - magnetized electron as well as electron - ion plasmas .",
    "interestingly the main instability condition for these modes is the same @xmath134 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the inverse of density and electron temperature gradient scale lengths , respectively .",

    "we have found that the inhomogeneous electron plasma can also support a low frequency electrostatic mode .",
    "this electrostatic mode can couple with the magnetic field perturbations to give rise to a partially electrostatic and partially transverse wave .",
    "therefore instead of the so called magnetic electron drift vortex ( medv ) mode there exists a low frequency electromagnetic wave having both the contributions of longitudinal and transverse electric field components as has been shown in equations ( 22 ) .",
    "the dispersion relation of medv mode is very similar to the electromagnetic wave discussed in this investigation as can be seen in equation ( 23 ) .",
    "but the important point to note is that this dispersion relation appears after a cancellation of two terms .",
    "one of these terms is a part of longitudinal electric field @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , if transverse electric field component @xmath82 is neglected one obtains a pure electrostatic wave of equation ( 25 ) .",
    "the frequency range of both the modes is very close to each other .",
    "the instability conditions are almost the same .",
    "this fact strengths the view point that magnetic fluctuations are coupled with the dominant electrostatic fields .",
    "+ any initial electrostatic field perturbation can produce its transverse component in the presence of density gradient @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can cause a coupling of ion acoustic wave ( iaw ) with the low frequency transverse magnetostatic mode .",
    "this coupled mode has already been investigated more than a decade ago @xcite .",
    "but it can exist in a relatively shorter wavelength range for @xmath135 .",
    "in the quasi - neutrality limit , the iaw and magnetostatic modes decouple .",
    "+ in case of the electron - ion plasmas , the iaw does not remain electrostatic in inhomogeneous plasmas @xcite . the electromagnetic mode discussed for the case of pure electron plasma can couple with ion acoustic wave as shown in equation ( 40 ) .",
    "similar to the electrostatic iaw , this low frequency electromagnetic ion wave can exist even in the quasi - neutrality limit .",
    "the electrostatic and electromagnetic waves discussed here can become unstable if the density and temperature gradients are parallel to each other which can be the case in laser plasmas similar to stellar cores .",
    "+ these low frequency waves can be the intrinsic source of magnetic fields in stars , galaxies as well as in laser plasmas .",
    "the main instability condition of the several electrostatic and electromagnetic waves discussed here is the same as given in the form of inequality ( 24 ) .",
    "therefore , in our opinion , electrostatic perturbations are strongly coupled with magnetic field fluctuations in inhomogeneous un - magnetized plasmas .",
