    "we are currently witnessing a  very rapid progress in the determination of neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "the mixing angles and the mass - squared differences governing oscillations of solar  @xcite and atmospheric  @xcite neutrinos are known with systematically improving precision ; for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the past - year results from the t2k  @xcite , minos  @xcite , and double chooz  @xcite experiments have brought indications that , in the three - neutrino framework , the last unknown mixing angle is nonvanishing .",
    "these hints have been confirmed by the findings from daya bay  @xcite , followed by those from reno  @xcite , with statistical significance of 5.2 and 4.9 standard deviations , respectively .",
    "three nonvanishing mixing angles are a  prerequisite for the existence of the phase violating the charge - parity ( cp ) symmetry .",
    "therefore , the results reported by the daya bay and reno collaborations are paving the way for studies of cp violation in the lepton sector , which , in turn , may bring us closer to understanding the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe .",
    "in addition , near - future experiments , such as no@xmath0a , will aim at the determination of the mass hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "the ongoing experiments might also be able to verify observations which do not seem to fit into the three - neutrino framework  @xcite .",
    "if these revelations were confirmed , their explanation would require invoking sterile neutrinos  @xcite and extending the standard model .",
    "the correct interpretation of the outcome of oscillation experiments requires a  precise knowledge of the ( anti)neutrino cross sections .",
    "this is the case even in those experiments in which the event yields in near and far detectors are compared , because , in general , flux and backgrounds do not scale in a  simple manner  @xcite .",
    "if the cross section used in the analysis is underestimated in some energy region , a  false oscillation signal will be obtained as a  consequence .",
    "the description of nuclear effects in neutrino scattering is now generally regarded as one of the main sources of systematic uncertainties in oscillation experiments . in particular , profound understanding of charged - current quasielastic ( ccqe )",
    "interaction with nucleons bound in the nucleus plays a  crucial role . in the energy region of @xmath11  gev",
    ", it is the dominant reaction mechanism . for the energy of a  few gev ,",
    "@xmath2-resonance excitation becomes equally important  @xcite .",
    "however , its description involves all  but not only  @xcite  the difficulties appearing in the ccqe case .",
    "the carbon nucleus is of special importance , because the targets applied in neutrino detectors often involve carbon compounds , such as mineral oil , polystyrene , or organic scintillators .",
    "in addition , the proper understanding of carbon may provide useful clues for the description of oxygen , as nuclear effects in these two targets are expected to be similar , based on the experience gained in electron scattering .",
    "the total @xmath3[6]{c}(\\nu_\\mu,\\mu^-)$ ] cross section as a  function of energy has recently been measured with the nomad  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite experiments .    in nomad ,",
    "studying neutrinos of energy down to 3  gev , ccqe events with and without knocked - out proton detected have been analyzed separately and , after adjusting the description of final - state interactions , shown to yield consistent results .",
    "thanks to the 45-gev average energy of the deep - inelastic - scattering events , the normalization has been determined from the well - known total inclusive charged - current ( cc ) cross section and from the purely leptonic process of inverse muon decay .",
    "the observed reduction of the cross section due to nuclear effects is @xmath14% .    in miniboone ,",
    "all events without pions detected have been classified as ccqe and the total cross section is extracted for energy up to 2  gev .",
    "the high statistics of ccqe events ( @xmath1@xmath4 those in nomad ) allowed for obtaining , for the first time , the double differential cross section .",
    "surprisingly , the reported total cross section for carbon is _ higher _ than that for free neutrons .",
    "the size of the effect is @xmath15% at a  few hundred mev , increasing to @xmath115% at neutrino energy higher than @xmath1850  mev .",
    "as a  20% uncertainty of the cross section would have an important impact on determination of oscillation parameters  @xcite , the difference between the nomad and miniboone results requires very careful theoretical analysis , in addition to the planned investigation with the scino@xmath0a experiment  @xcite .",
    "the miniboone collaboration has also measured the cross section for neutral - current elastic ( nce ) interaction , in which nuclear effects are expected not to differ from those in the ccqe channel .",
    "the nce data may thus provide a  cross - check for the applied description of the target nucleus and , what is even more important , additional information on nucleon kinematics in the miniboone experiment , unavailable in ccqe scattering .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we pay special attention to nce scattering .",
    "a  complete description of a  nucleus should account for both the shell structure and nucleon - nucleon correlations of various kind .",
    "the shell structure is particularly important for studies involving low - energy probes .",
    "correlations , causing strength fragmentation and partial depletion of the shells , modify the nuclear structure and give rise to deeply bound nucleons with high momentum , which are only accessible to high - energy probes .    owing to the complicated nature of nuclear interactions and to the large number of nucleons , in the description of the carbon nucleus ,",
    "approximations are necessary .",
    "one needs , however , to be aware of the accuracy of the approximations applied .",
    "for example , the nuclear transparency of carbon calculated without accounting for correlations is underestimated by @xmath115%  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model neglects both the shell structure and correlations , treating the nucleus as a  fragment of noninteracting nuclear matter of uniform density in a  constant potential .",
    "due to its simplicity , it is applied in monte carlo generators used in data analysis .",
    "one needs to bear in mind , however , that obtaining good agreement between the simulation and the distributions of collected events may require introducing various _",
    "ad hoc _ modifications , as a remedy for the shortcomings of the rfg approach  @xcite .",
    "obviously , all modifications applied to experimental analysis must be justified on physics grounds within a  consistent theoretical scheme .",

    "martini _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have developed an approach based on the random - phase approximation , which subsequently has been improved by introducing relativistic corrections  .",

    "it is worth noting that the differences between the expressions for the nce cross section given in this paper and those in ref .",
    "@xcite , describing nuclear effects within the relativistic fermi gas model , can be traced back to a  different treatment of the off - shell dynamics .    in our approach ,",

    ", even the terms vanishing on the mass shell are kept .",
    "for example , the structure function @xmath90 contributes to the nce cross section only due to off - shell effects , because when @xmath91 the coefficient @xmath92 is proportional to the neutrino mass . neglecting @xmath90 increases the total @xmath3[6]{c}(\\nu,\\nu')$ ]",
    "cross section by 1.4% at @xmath93  mev . for higher and lower energy",

    "the strength of final state interactions ( fsi ) in neutrino scattering can be deduced from comparison between electron scattering data and theoretical results , although the picture is obscured by flux averaging .",
    "the effect of fsi is shown to be sizable in the relativistic and semirelativistic approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite , which account for it by means of strong relativistic potentials or their semirelativistic equivalents . yielding the overwhelming contribution to the high-@xmath94 tail of the @xmath48 cross section  @xcite , fsi play in these mean - field models an essential role in bringing the results in good agreement with data  @xcite .    within the sf approach ,",
    "fsi are much weaker .",
    "the tail of the cross section originates from short - range correlations between nucleons in the initial state and is only slightly enhanced by fsi  @xcite . as observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in most of the kinematical region spanned by the miniboone data set , the main effect of fsi on the double differential @xmath48 cross section is a shift of the quasielastic peak of the order of 10  mev . using the energy - dependent and @xmath47-independent fit to the dirac optical potential of carbon  @xcite",
    ", we find the shift averaged over the miniboone kinematics to be 6.8 mev , consistent with the observation of the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite . at higher momentum transfers , allowed in nomad ,",
    "fsi are known to lead to a redistribution of the inclusive strength , resulting in the quenching of the quasielastic peak and the enhancement of its tails  @xcite .",
    "( quasi)elastic processes constrain the high-@xmath95 contribution to appear solely at high @xmath6 , making it negligibly small due to the nucleon form factors .",
    "for example , while at a  neutrino energy of 100 gev momentum transfers up to 100.85 gev are allowed , as much as 89.8 ( 97.5)% of the @xmath3[6]{c}(\\nu_\\mu,\\mu^-)$ ] cross section comes from @xmath96 ( 2.747 )  gev , the range of @xmath95 for @xmath97 ( 2 )  gev .",
    "hence , in the context of our work , the kinematical setup of nomad does not differ significantly from that of miniboone .    in this paper , we consider the total cross sections and the flux - averaged differential cross sections @xmath98 for neutrino and antineutrino ( quasi)elastic scattering . as fsi",
    "may cause only a  redistribution and a  shift of the strength , they do not affect the total cross section .",
    "the differential cross sections @xmath98 are expected to be modified by fsi at @xmath99 gev@xmath54  @xcite , because only at this kinematics the real part of the optical potential significantly changes the typical energy of the knocked - out nucleon , compare to eq .",

    "<S> background : :    good understanding of the cross sections for ( anti)neutrino scattering    off nuclear targets in the few - gev energy region is a  prerequisite for    the correct interpretation of results of ongoing and planned    oscillation experiments . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    clarify a  possible source of disagreement between recent measurements    of the cross sections on carbon . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    nuclear effects in ( anti)neutrino scattering off carbon nucleus are    described using the spectral function approach . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of two- and    multinucleon final states is accounted for by applying an effective    value of the axial mass , fixed to 1.23  gev . </S>",
    "<S> neutral - current elastic    ( nce ) and charged - current quasielastic ( ccqe ) processes are treated on    equal footing . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    the differential and total cross sections for the energy ranging from    a  few hundreds of mev to 100  gev are obtained and compared to the    available data from the bnl e734 , miniboone , and nomad experiments . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    nuclear effects in nce and ccqe scattering seem to be very similar .    within the spectral function approach , the axial mass from the shape    analysis of the miniboone data is in good agreement with the results    reported by the bnl e734 and nomad collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> however , the    combined analysis of the nce and ccqe data does not seem to support    the contribution of multinucleon final states being large enough to    explain the normalization of the miniboone - reported cross sections . </S>"
