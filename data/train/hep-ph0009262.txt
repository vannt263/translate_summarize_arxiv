    "within the framework of the standard model ( sm ) , the structure of the trilinear and quartic vector boson couplings is completely determined by the @xmath5 gauge symmetry .",

    "boson couplings are being probed at the tevatron @xcite and lep @xcite through the production of vector boson pairs , however , we have only started to study directly the quartic gauge ",
    "boson couplings @xcite .",
    "it is important to independently measure the trilinear and quartic gauge boson couplings because there are extensions of the sm @xcite that leave the trilinear couplings unchanged but do modify the quartic vertices .",
    "a simple way to generate , at tree level , new quartic gauge boson interactions is , for instance , by the exchange of a heavy boson between vector boson pairs .",
    "the phenomenological studies of the anomalous vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7 have already been carried out for @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , and @xmath10 @xcite colliders . some preliminary estimates of the potential of the tevatron collider have been also presented in ref .",
    "@xcite where only the effect on the total cross section for `` neutral '' final states @xmath11 and @xmath12 were considered while the most promising charged final state @xmath13 was not included . in this paper we analyze the potential of hadron colliders to unravel deviations on the quartic vector boson couplings by examining the most relevant processes which are the production of two photons accompanied by a lepton pair , where the fermions are produced by the decay of either a @xmath14 or a @xmath15 in the anomalous contribution , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath16 as well as the production of photon pairs accompanied by jets @xmath17 for the lhc .",
    "we carry out a detailed analysis of these reactions taking into account the full sm background leading to the same final state .",
    "we introduce realistic cuts in order to reduce this background and we include the effect of detector efficiencies in the evaluation of the attainable limits .",
    "we further consider the energy dependence ( form factor ) of the anomalous couplings in order to comply with the unitarity bounds .",
    "our results show that although the analysis of tevatron run i data can only provide limits on these quartic couplings which are worse than the existing bounds from lepii searches , the tevatron run ii could yield bounds of the same order of magnitude as the present lepii limits",
    ". moreover , the lhc will be able to tighten considerably the direct constraints on these possible new interactions , giving rise to limits more stringent than the presently available indirect bounds .    in order to perform a model independent analysis",
    ", we use a chiral lagrangian to parametrize the anomalous @xmath6 and @xmath7 interactions @xcite .",
    "assuming that there is no higgs boson in the low energy spectrum we employ a nonlinear representation of the spontaneously broken @xmath2 gauge symmetry .",
    "to construct such lagrangian , it is useful to define the matrix  valued scalar field @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the broken generators and @xmath20 are the nambu  goldstone bosons of the global symmetry - breaking pattern @xmath21 .",
    "we denote the unbroken generator by @xmath22 and our conventions are such that @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "in order to write the effective lagrangian for the gauge bosons , it is convenient to introduce the auxiliary quantity @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the generators of @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively",

    "notice that the fields @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 transform only electromagnetically under @xmath2 .",

    "we denote the new contribution to the two  point functions as @xmath56 and we take here the opportunity to update the constraints on @xmath57 and @xmath58 derived in ref .  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to notice from the structure of the lagrangians that the contributions to the @xmath55 and @xmath54 self ",
    "energies are constant , _",
    "i.e. _ they do not depend on the external momentum .",
    "moreover , due to the @xmath49 custodial symmetry they are related by @xmath59 as a consequence the couplings @xmath57 and @xmath58 do not contribute to @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "equivalently their contribution to @xmath61 vanishes .",
    "moreover , the unbroken @xmath40 symmetry constrains the photon self - energy contribution to be of the form @xmath62 where for the anomalous interactions ( [ l : eff ] ) @xmath63 is a constant .",
    "this also implies that these anomalous interactions do not modify the running of the electromagnetic coupling .",
    "however , both interactions give rise to corrections to @xmath64 or , equivalently , to the @xmath65 and @xmath66 parameters @xcite .",
    "following the standard procedure , we evaluated the vector boson two  point functions using dimensional regularization and subsequently kept only the leading non  analytic contributions from the loop diagrams to constrain the new interactions  that is , we maintained only the logarithmic terms , dropping all others .",
    "the contributions that are relevant for our analysis are easily obtained by the substitution @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the energy scale which characterizes the appearance of new physics , and @xmath69 is the scale in the process , which we take to be @xmath70 .",

    "the lep collaborations have directly probed anomalous quartic couplings involving photons . l3 and opal",
    "have searched for their effects in the reactions @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , while the aleph collaboration has reported results only on the last reaction @xcite .",
    "the combined results for all these searches lead to the following 95% cl direct limits on the quartic vertices @xcite @xmath78    another way to constrain the couplings in ( [",
    "l : eff ] ) is to notice that this effective lagrangian leads to tree - level unitarity violation in @xmath79 processes at high energies . in order to extract the unitarity bounds on the anomalous interactions we evaluated the partial wave helicity amplitudes ( @xmath80 ) for the inelastic scattering @xmath81 , with @xmath82 and @xmath14 ; see table [ a0numu ] .",
    "unitarity requires that @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the velocity of the final state boson in the center  of  mass frame .",
    "for the anomalous interactions ( [ l : eff ] ) , the most restrictive bounds come from the @xmath85 partial wave , which read @xmath86 where @xmath87 or @xmath58 and @xmath88 for @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "for instance , unitarity is violated for @xmath8 invariant masses above 240 gev for @xmath89 gev@xmath90 ( one of the present lep bounds ) .",
    "these unitarity constraints are of relevance when extracting the bounds on the anomalous couplings at hadron colliders since it is possible to obtain large parton  parton center  of  mass energies , and consequently have a large unitarity violation .",
    "the standard procedure to avoid this unphysical behavior of the subprocess cross section and to obtain meaningful limits is to multiply the anomalous couplings by a form factor @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the invariant mass of the photon pair .",
    "of course using this procedure the limits become dependent on the exponent @xmath93 and the scale @xmath68 which is not longer factorizable . in our calculations ,",
    "we conservatively choose @xmath94 and @xmath68 = 0.5 tev for the tevatron and @xmath68 = 0.5 ( 2.5 ) tev for the lhc . in the case of @xmath95 colliders the center  of ",
    "mass energy is fixed and the introduction of the form factor ( [ ff ] ) is basically equivalent to a rescaling of the anomalous couplings @xmath96 , therefore we should perform this rescaling when comparing results obtained at hadron and @xmath95 colliders . for example , for our choice of @xmath93 and @xmath68 the lep limits should be weakened by a factor @xmath97 .    the dynamical effect of the above form factor can be seen in figure [ m : gg ] where we present the normalized invariant mass distribution of the @xmath8 pair for the process ( [ ln ] ) at the tevatron run ii and lhc , assuming that only @xmath57 contributes . as expected , the form factor reduces the number of photon pairs with high invariant mass .",
    "similar behavior is obtained for reaction ( [ ll ] ) and for the anomalous @xmath58 contribution .",
    "in this work we studied the reactions ( [ ln ] ) and ( [ ll ] ) for the tevatron and lhc , that is , the associated production of a photon pair and a @xmath98 or @xmath99 which decay leptonically , as well as the process ( [ jj ] ) only for the lhc since the tevatron center  of  mass energy is too low for this process to be of any significance . process ( [ ln ] ) can be used to study the @xmath100 vertex while process ( [ ll ] ) probes the @xmath53 interaction and the reaction ( [ jj ] ) receives contributions from @xmath100 and @xmath53 .",
    "we evaluated numerically the helicity amplitudes of all the sm subprocesses leading to the @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 final states where @xmath104 can be either a gluon , a quark or an antiquark .",
    "the sm amplitudes were generated using madgraph @xcite in the framework of helas @xcite routines .",
    "the anomalous interactions arising from the lagrangian ( [ l : eff ] ) were implemented as subroutines and were included accordingly .",
    "we consistently took into account the effect of all interferences between the anomalous and the sm amplitudes , and did not use the narrow  width approximation for the vector boson propagators .    in the case of the tevatron collider , we considered the parameters of the run i , _ i.e. _ @xmath105 tev and an integrated luminosity of 100 pb@xmath106 .",
    "we also investigated the reach of the tevatron run ii assuming @xmath107 tev and an integrated luminosity of @xmath108 pb@xmath106 .",
    "for the lhc , we took a center  of  mass energy of 14 tev and a luminosity of 10@xmath109 pb@xmath106 . in our calculations",
    "we used the mrs ( g ) @xcite set of proton structure functions with the factorization scale @xmath110 .",
    "we started our analysis of the processes ( [ ln ] ) and ( [ ll ] ) imposing a minimal set of cuts to guarantee that the photons and charged leptons are detected and isolated from each other : @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath104 stand for the final photons and charged leptons . for the @xmath113 final state , we also imposed a cut the transverse mass of the @xmath114 pair ( @xmath115 ) @xmath116 in the case of @xmath117 production , we required the tag of a @xmath54 decaying leptonically imposing that @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the invariant mass of the lepton pair . in our calculations , we have also taken into account the detection efficiency of the final state particles .",
    "we assumed a 85% detection efficiency of isolated photons , electrons , and muons .",
    "therefore , the efficiency for reconstructing the final state @xmath113 is 61% while the efficiency for @xmath120 is @xmath121% .    considering the cuts ( [ cuts ] ) , ( [ cuts1 ] ) , and ( [ cuts2 ] ) , and the detection efficiencies discussed above , the sm prediction for the cross sections and expected number of events of the processes ( [ ln ] ) and ( [ ll ] ) are presented in table [ smev ] . as we can see , the above basic cuts are enough to eliminate the sm background at the tevatron run i , however , further cuts are needed to control the background at the tevatron run ii and lhc .    in order to reduce the sm background for the tevatron run",
    "ii and lhc , we analyzed a few kinematical distributions .",
    "the most significant difference between the sm and anomalous predictions appears in the transverse energy of the photons , which is shown in figure [ et ] for the reaction ( [ ln ] ) and @xmath122 .",
    "similar behavior is obtained for the reaction ( [ ll ] ) and for the anomalous @xmath58 contribution .",
    "therefore , we tightened the cut on the transverse energy of the final photons , as suggested by fig .",
    "[ et ] , to enhance the significance of the anomalous contribution .",
    "@xmath123 the effect of these cuts can be seen in table [ smev ] where we display the new cross sections and expected number of events in parenthesis .",
    "as we can see , no sm event is expected at the tevatron run ii after this new cut , while very few events survive at the lhc .",
    "we parametrized the cross sections for processes ( [ ln ] ) and ( [ ll ] ) after cuts ( [ cuts])([new : cuts ] ) as @xmath124 where @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 are , respectively , the sm cross section , interference between the sm and the anomalous contribution and the pure anomalous cross section .",
    "@xmath128 stands for @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "the results for @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 are presented in table [ tabcrosssection ] .",
    "process ( [ jj ] ) receives contributions from @xmath98 and @xmath99 productions and their subsequent decay into jets , as well as from vector boson fusion ( vbf ) @xmath129 the signal for hadronic decays of @xmath55 s and @xmath54 s is immersed in a huge qcd background .",
    "therefore , we tuned our cuts in order to extract the vbf production of photon pairs since it presents two very energetic forward jets that can be used to efficiently tag the events . in our analyses",
    ", we required that the photons satisfy @xmath130 assuming a 85% detection efficiency of isolated photons , the efficiency for reconstructing the final state @xmath131 is 72% .",
    "table [ smev ] also contains the sm cross section for the vbf production of photon pair taking into account the above cuts .",
    "as we can see , the vbf reaction possesses a much higher statistics than the production of photon pairs associated to leptons . in order to enhance the vbf signal for the anomalous couplings we studied a few kinematical distributions and found out that the most significant difference between the signal and sm background occurs in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum",
    "; see fig .",
    "thusly , we imposed the following additional cuts @xmath132 this cut reduces the sm background cross section by a factor of at least 5 ; see table [ smev ] where we also present the signal cross section after cuts for @xmath133 500 and 2500 gev . the results for @xmath125 and @xmath127 of eq .",
    "( [ crosssection ] ) are presented in table [ tabcrosssection ] .",
    "since the interference between the sm and the anomalous contribution is negligible in this case , we do not present the results for @xmath126 .",
    "taking into account the integrated luminosities of the tevatron and lhc and the results shown in table [ tabcrosssection ] , we evaluated the potential 95% cl limits on @xmath57 and @xmath58 in the case that there is no deviation from the sm predictions ; see table [ lftalhc ] .",
    "we also exhibit in this table our choice for the scale @xmath68 appearing in the form factor .",
    "therefore , at the tevatron , the most restrictive constraints are obtained from the reaction ( [ ln ] ) for @xmath57 and @xmath58 . combining both reactions we are able to impose a 95% cl limit @xmath134 gev@xmath90 at the tevatron run ii , which is of the same order of the direct bounds coming from lepii . on the other hand ,",
    "the most stringent limits at the lhc will come from the photon pair production via vbf , whose bounds are a factor of 510 stronger than the ones coming from the reactions ( [ ln ] ) and ( [ ll ] ) . this general statement does not seem to apply for the limits on @xmath58 with @xmath133 500 gev , which is more strongly constrained by the process ( [ ln ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising because , for the reactions ( [ ln ] ) and ( [ ll ] ) , the set of cuts ( [ new : cuts ] ) leave the @xmath58 signal practically unaffected , i.e. this set of general cuts is particularly optimum for this coupling and reactions .",
    "this is also there reason why the derived limits on @xmath58 are better than the limits for @xmath57 only for this case .",
    "we are just beginning to test the sm predictions for the quartic vector boson interactions . due to",
    "the limited available center  of  mass energy , the first couplings to be studied contain two photons , and just at the lhc and the nlc we will be able to probe @xmath135 ( @xmath136 or @xmath54 ) vertices @xcite . in this work we analyzed the production of photon pairs in association with @xmath137 , @xmath138 , or @xmath139 in hadron colliders .",
    "these processes violate unitarity at high energy , therefore , we cutoff the growth of the subprocess cross section via the introduction of form factors which enforce unitarity and render the calculation meaningful .",
    "we showed that the study of the processes ( [ ln ] ) and ( [ ll ] ) at tevatron run i lead to constraints on the quartic anomalous couplings that are a factor of four weaker than the presently available bounds derived from lepii data . on the other hand , the tevatron run ii has the potential to probe the quartic anomalous interactions at the same level of lepii .",
    "an important improvement on the bounds on the genuine quartic couplings will be obtained at the lhc collider where , for @xmath140 tev , a limit of @xmath141 gev@xmath90 will be reached .",
    "therefore , the direct limits on the anomalous interaction steaming from lhc will be stronger than the ones coming from the precise measurements at the @xmath54 pole .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the lhc will lead to limits that are similar to the ones attainable at an @xmath95 collider operating at @xmath142 gev with a luminosity of 300 pb@xmath106 , which are @xmath143 gev@xmath90 @xcite .",
