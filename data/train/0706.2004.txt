    "semiconductor superlattices ( sls ) are nanostructures made from alternating layers of two different semiconductor materials , usually with very similar lattice constants , for example gaas and ( alga)as @xcite . due to the different energy band gaps of the two materials ,",
    "the conduction band edge of an ideal superlattice is periodically modulated .",
    "typically , a sl made by molecular beam epitaxy contains 10 - 100 quantum wells in series , which are coupled by tunnel barriers .",
    "this periodic potential leads to the formation of energy bands , known as `` minibands '' , for electron motion perpendicular to the layers @xcite .",
    "a voltage applied to ohmic contacts at the two ends of the sl generates an electric field , @xmath0 , perpendicular to the plane of the layers ( see fig . [ schema ] ) , which causes charge to flow through the device .",
    "the current - voltage characteristics of sls are usually highly nonlinear due to a variety of quantum mechanical effects including resonant tunneling , the formation of wannier - stark energy level ladders , and the occurrence of bloch oscillations @xcite , whose frequency is proportional to the spatial period , @xmath1 , of the sl and , also , to @xmath2 . in natural crystals , @xmath1 is so small ( @xmath3 nm ) that bloch oscillations do not occur because the bloch frequency is much less than the electron scattering rate . but in sls , @xmath1 and the corresponding bloch frequency can be large enough for the electrons to perform bloch oscillations , which then play a key role in both the dc and high - frequency charge transport processes .",
    "the onset of bloch oscillations localizes the electrons , thus causing their drift ( average ) velocity to decrease as the electric field increases .",
    "this negative differential velocity can induce high - frequency collective oscillations of the conduction electrons within the sl layers @xcite , making sls attractive for the generation and detection of electromagnetic radiation in the ghz to thz frequency range @xcite .    , which lies in the @xmath4 plane at an angle @xmath5 to the sl ( @xmath6 ) axis .",
    "the lower arrow shows direction of the electric field , @xmath0 , applied perpendicular to the plane of the layers and anti - parallel to the @xmath6 axis . ]    the occurrence of negative differential velocity for electrons in sls has also led to fundamentally new regimes of charge transport involving deterministic chaos , characterized by complex irregular electron dynamics @xcite .",
    "understanding the effects of chaos on the current - voltage characteristics , @xmath7 , and high - frequency electromagnetic properties of sls is an emerging research area at the interface between nonlinear dynamics and condensed matter physics .",
    "in most previous studies , chaos in sls was identified in the cooperative motion of interacting electrons in either periodically driven @xcite or undriven sls @xcite .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental work has revealed that the single - particle trajectories and collective behavior of electrons moving through the lowest miniband of a biased sl with a tilted magnetic field have unique properties @xcite .",
    "for example , the electrons exhibit an unusual type of hamiltonian chaos , known as `` non - kam '' chaos @xcite , which does not obey the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theorem and provides a sensitive new mechanism for controlling electron transport .",
    "remarkably , the effective classical hamiltonian for the electron motion in a sl has an intrinsically quantum - mechanical origin as it depends explicitly on the energy versus wavevector dispersion relation of the miniband @xcite .",
    "analysis of hamilton s equations reveals that the stochastic electron motion switches on abruptly when the field parameters satisfy certain resonance conditions , described in detail below .",
    "the onset of chaos delocalizes the electrons by imprinting an intricate mesh of conduction channels ( known as a `` stochastic web '' ) in phase space , which produces large resonant enhancement of the electron velocity and current flow measured in experiment @xcite .",
    "this phase - space patterning provides a fundamentally new concept for controlling electrical conductance @xcite and operates even at room temperature @xcite .    in the absence of dissipation",
    ", the resonant delocalization of the conduction electrons would produce a series of delta - function peaks in the @xmath7  curves .",
    "but in real sls , the resonances are broadened because the electrons scatter both elastically @xcite , due mainly to roughness at the interfaces between the tunnel barriers and quantum wells and to ionized donor atoms , and inelastically via the emission and absorption of phonons .",
    "when calculating the transport characteristics of the sls , the effect of scattering on the electron dynamics must be taken into account in order to obtain @xmath7curves that agree with experiment .",
    "in our previous theoretical work @xcite , we incorporated electron scattering in the following phenomenological way .",
    "first , we calculated the electron trajectories by solving hamilton s equations for the system , assuming @xmath8 scattering .",
    "next , we used these trajectories to determine the average electron velocity from a simple kinetic formula in which scattering appears _ a posteriori _ as an exponential damping term whose decay rate depends on the elastic and inelastic relaxation times . in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether the striking electron resonance effects and phase space patterning predicted by our earlier collision - free hamiltonian model of the electron dynamics persist when scattering is included _ a priori _ in the equations of motion .",
    "we find that when the scattering is described in this way , it creates far richer electron dynamics than expected from our previous hamiltonian analysis .",
    "in particular , scattering makes the system highly sensitive to changes in the control parameters ( electric and magnetic fields ) , which induce complex bifurcation sequences characterized by alternating windows of stability and chaos .",
    "counter - intuitively , dissipation also enhances the resonant delocalization of the semiclassical trajectories by creating attractors that drive the electrons rapidly through the sl .",
    "the regimes of dissipative chaos that we have identified have a pronounced effect on the velocity - field characteristics of the miniband electrons and provide mechanisms for controlling sl magnetotransport by exploiting complex nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the semiclassical equations of motion for a miniband electron in a tilted magnetic field and show how scattering is included _ a priori _ in those equations . in section iii",
    ", we show that scattering dramatically changes the electron trajectories and phase space structure of the system by creating attractors corresponding to periodic orbits that extend through the whole sl .",
    "in section iv , we present a detailed analysis of the stability of the electron orbits .",
    "section v explores the complex series of resonances that scattering induces in the electron dynamics and elucidates the effect of these resonances on the electron velocity and experimentally - measured electrical current .",
    "finally , in section vi , we summarize our results and draw conclusions .",
    "in a sl , quantum mechanical tunneling broadens the discrete quantized energy levels of each individual quantum well into sl minibands .",
    "the miniband states are delocalized bloch functions specified by the crystal momentum @xmath9 @xmath10=@xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the corresponding electron wavevector . within the tight - binding approximation , the energy versus crystal momentum dispersion relation for the lowest miniband is @xmath13/2+(p_y^2+p_z^2)/2m^{\\ast}$ ] , where @xmath14 is the miniband width , @xmath1 is the sl period , and @xmath15 is the electron effective mass for motion in the @xmath16 plane .",
    "the crystal momentum component , @xmath17 , is taken to lie within the first minizone of the sl .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we consider electron motion in an electric field @xmath18 applied anti - parallel to the @xmath6 axis , and a tilted magnetic field @xmath19 ) ( fig . [ schema ] ) . in a semiclassical picture , which neglects inter - miniband tunneling ,",
    "the force produced by the electric and magnetic fields changes the electron s crystal momentum at a rate @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electronic charge .",
    "equation ( 1 ) can be written in the component form @xmath22 where the left hand terms are time derivatives of the crystal momentum components and @xmath23=@xmath24 is the cyclotron frequency corresponding to the magnetic field component along the @xmath6 axis .",

    "but when @xmath35 , electron motion in the @xmath6 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 directions is coupled , which means that the dissipation term affects all of the dynamical variables , thus simulating the scattering processes that occur in a real sl device .",
    "recent experiments @xcite have shown that the presence of a high magnetic field strongly affects the inelastic scattering mechanisms required for current to flow through a biased sl @xcite . in particular , when @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the emission of longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons is strongly suppressed if the phonon energy , @xmath40 = 36 mev in gaas , exceeds @xmath14 @xcite , which is the case for the sl that we studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this low - dissipation regime",
    ", the current falls almost to zero because the oscillatory bloch motion along the @xmath6 direction is not damped by lo phonon emission .",

    "( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) decouple in the limit @xmath41 , which means that the @xmath6 motion is undamped , and so the mean electron velocity is zero . in the experiments",
    "@xcite , as @xmath5 increases from 0 , the current rises dramatically because the selection rules that prevent lo phonon emission when @xmath38 are broken .",

    "our analysis of such dynamics for electrons in a sl with a tilted magnetic field is therefore also of general interest in nonlinear dynamics and in the diverse areas of physics mentioned above , which involve the behavior of a harmonic oscillator driven by a plane wave .",

    "however , for the electron momentum relaxation rates measured for sls used in recent experiments @xcite , chaos occurs for a wide range of @xmath2 and @xmath88 values , usually when @xmath172 ( see figs .",
    "[ bif1 ] , [ bif2 ] ) .",
    "two distinct bifurcation mechanisms drive the transition to chaos : a period - doubling cascade , where the onset of chaos is gradual , and a boundary crisis , which switches chaos on abruptly .",
    "both mechanisms operate for all tilt angles in the range @xmath173 . for both hamiltonian and dissipative models of the electron dynamics ,",
    "the onset of chaos occurs near resonances when @xmath50 and @xmath23 are commensurate .",
    "such resonances cause an abrupt delocalization of the electron trajectories , due either to stochastic web formation in a hamiltonian picture , or to the creation of attractors corresponding to unbounded stable limit cycles when dissipation is included _",
    "ab initio _ in the equations of motion .",
    "this delocalization produces large resonant peaks in the electron drift velocity , which , in turn , generate the strong resonant enhancement of the current flow observed in our recent experiments @xcite . in the case of dissipative dynamics",
    ", the drift velocity increases near resonances because the most probable value of @xmath144 that the electron attains during its unbounded limit cycle is very close to the maximal possible value , determined by the sl parameters ( fig .",
    "resonances between @xmath50 and @xmath23 also give rise to multistability phenomena when two or more different attractors coexist in phase space .",
    "multistability makes limit cycles , and the corresponding @xmath130 values , evolve differently when @xmath2 or @xmath88 sweeps up or down through a resonance .",
    "we expect that this hysteresis will also have striking experimental signatures .",
    "in particular , our calculations suggest that experimental @xmath156 or @xmath7 curves will exhibit pronounced hysteresis , reflecting that shown in fig .",
    "[ hyst ] for electron drift velocities , especially at high field values .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the driven harmonic oscillator equation ( [ peneq ] ) , which describes the motion of miniband electrons in a tilted magnetic field , is also of fundamental importance in many other physical systems , for example plasma @xcite , ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , the transmission of light through photonic crystals @xcite , turbulent flow and in understanding the patterns of quasi - crystals @xcite . although the motion of the _ dissipation - free _ harmonic oscillator driven by a plane wave is well understood , to our knowledge the effects of dissipation have not previously been considered .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that even in the presence of dissipation , deterministic chaos plays an important role in the electron transport process . </S>",
