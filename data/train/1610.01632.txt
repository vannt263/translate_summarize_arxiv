    "optical surveys sampling the sky over time scales of a few days significantly advanced our knowledge of astronomical transients of different origins , including super - luminous supernovae ( slsne ; @xcite ) , very fast - rising stellar explosions ( e.g. @xcite ) and stellar tidal disruptions by super - massive black holes ( tdes ; @xcite ) .",
    "occasionally , a transient is found with properties that seem to defy all previous classification schemes . the event asassn-15lh belongs to this category .",
    "asassn-15lh ( @xcite ) was discovered by the all - sky automated survey for supernovae ( asas - sn ) on 14 june 2015 at z=0.2326 ( @xmath1 mpc for standard _",
    "cosmology ) .",
    "its extremely large peak luminosity @xmath2 and the blue , almost featureless spectrum with no apparent sign of h or he ( and some spectroscopic resemblance to the slsn 2010gx ) led @xcite and @xcite to suggest that asassn-15lh is the most luminous slsn ever detected .",
    "the very large energy radiated by assasn-15lh ( @xmath3 , @xcite ) , requires extreme properties of the progenitor star and sources of energy that are different from the standard radioactive decay of @xmath4ni that powers normal h - stripped sne in the local universe ( @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", the double - humped light - curve of asassn-15lh has been interpreted by @xcite as a signature of the interaction of massive sn ejecta @xmath5 with an h - poor circumstellar shell of @xmath6 , possibly supplemented by radiation from a newly - born rapidly - rotating magnetar @xcite .    the old , massive @xmath7 host galaxy of asassn-15lh , with limited star formation ( @xmath8 ; @xcite ) , is however markedly different from those of core - collapse sne ( e.g. @xcite ) as well as of envelope - stripped slsne , which tend to be younger star forming systems with significantly lower stellar mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "this observation , together with the location of the transient , astrometrically consistent with the host galaxy nucleus , inspired a connection between asassn-15lh and the tidal disruption of a star by the host - galaxy super - massive black hole ( smbh , @xcite ) . in this context asassn-15lh would be the most luminous tde ever observed , associated to a smbh with mass @xmath9 @xcite significantly larger than any smbh presently associated to a tde ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that the luminosity , the spectral properties and the double - humped ( i.e. , `` bactrian '' ) light - curve of asassn-15lh , as well as its host galaxy , are unprecedented both in the context of slsne and in the context of tdes .    in this paper we present and discuss the following observational facts : [ i ] uncovering of persistent , soft x - ray emission at the location of asassn-15lh ( sec .",

    "we propose a scenario where a single physical mechanism can naturally explain the double - humped light - curve of asassn-15lh and suggest that its location , very close or coincident with the nucleus of a galaxy that harbors a massive smbh , is likely the key to unlocking the mysterious nature of the transient ( sec .",

    "the analysis of each of the two epochs taken separately points to a soft x - ray spectrum , with limited absorption and no evidence for statistically significant evolution between the two epochs .",
    "we thus constrain the x - ray source spectral parameters with a joint spectral fit of the two cxo epochs of observation , where the spectral normalization is allowed to vary from one epoch to the other .",

    "[ fig : chandra ] we find that : ( i ) the x - ray source shows a soft spectrum ( most of the allowed parameter space is at @xmath46 and @xmath47 kev ) with limited intrinsic absorption ( of the order of a few @xmath48 at most ) .",
    "there is no evidence for strong temporal and/or spectral variability of the x - ray source .",
    "we first evaluate the possibility that the x - ray emission arises from a population of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) residing in the early - type host galaxy , using the @xmath49 and @xmath50 relations by @xcite . for the host - galaxy of asassn-15lh @xcite",

    "we conclude that lmxbs are unlikely to be the source of the detected x - rays .",
    "we thus envision two possible scenarios : either the x - rays originate from weak agn activity from the host galaxy nucleus or they are physically connected to the optical / uv transient . in the first case we expect a somewhat stable x - ray emission over the time scale of years , while we anticipate fading if the x - ray emission is directly connected to asassn-15lh .",
    "future observations will clarify the origin of the detected high - energy emission .",
    "below we put our results into the context of x - ray emission from known transients ( i.e. sne and tdes ) .",
    "the detected emission is softer than the typical x - ray spectrum of sne associated with gamma - ray bursts ( @xmath55 , e.g. @xcite ) and normal h - stripped sne ( e.g. @xcite ) , which typically show @xmath55 and a decaying flux with time .",
    "a way to sustain luminous x - ray emission over a long time is to invoke the sn shock interaction with a thick medium ( see e.g. sn2014c , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the observed x - ray spectrum of h - stripped sne strongly interacting with the environment is even harder ( @xmath56 kev ) , and thus even more different from what we observe at the location of asassn-15lh ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus unlikely that a sn shock interaction with the medium is powering both the x - ray and optical / uv emission from asassn-15lh .",
    "finally , compared to the only other x - ray source associated to a slsn - i so far , the emission at the location of asassn-15lh is also softer and significantly longer lived ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xrayslc ] ) : for the slsn - i scp06f6 , @xcite reports @xmath57 ( or a thermal spectrum with @xmath58 kev ) .",

    "as for the tdes asassn-15oi @xcite and asassn-14li @xcite , the x - ray emission is more luminous than what expected based on the extrapolation of the optical / uv blackbody model ( see sec .",

    "however , the presence of spectral features from the host stellar population has the potential to improve the constraints on the stellar population synthesis , so we used an iterative procedure to incorporate this information while avoiding the flux from the transient .",

    "@xcite noted two emission peaks near 4000 and 5200    in their late - time spectra of asassn-15lh .",
    "however , accurate modeling of the host galaxy stellar component from our late - time spectrum demonstrates that the most prominent broad spectral features detected in the observed ( host plus transient ) late - time spectra have to be attributed to the underlying continuum from the host galaxy star light ( figure [ fig : spec1 ] ) .",

    "this line ratio , combined with weak [ ] /h@xmath100 and [ ] /h@xmath90 , is consistent with the nebular emission being powered by star formation instead of agn activity @xcite .",
    "we caution that these ratios are sensitive to systematic errors in the modeling of the underlying stellar absorption , and in particular the strength of the stellar balmer absorption . if all of the inferred h@xmath90 emission ( flux @xmath652.7@xmath9310@xmath101 erg  @xmath102  s@xmath103 ) is powered by star formation , the inferred rate is @xmath650.4  @xmath95  yr@xmath103 @xcite , in rough agreement with that estimated from the host galaxy stellar population fit .",
    "@xcite reported h@xmath90 emission from asassn-15lh with a full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 2500  km  s@xmath103 , but in our data , it is clear that the reported emission feature is just the narrow nebular h@xmath90 and [ ] from the host blended together at low s / n or low resolution in their data .",
    "note that in their highest s / n spectra ( inset of their figure 1 ) , the putative h@xmath90 from the transient is flat - topped or double peaked , consistent with the two strong nebular emission lines of roughly equal height ( inset of our figure  [ fig : spec1 ] ) being blended together .",
    "we also note that @xcite do not attempt to correct for the contribution from the underlying stellar continuum .",
    "therefore , we do not confirm their claim of h@xmath90 emission from the transient itself and the reported velocity fwhm likely reflects the spacing of the two [ ] lines , which are each offset by @xmath651000  km  s@xmath103 from the central h@xmath90 emission .",
    "@xcite also report a `` bump '' near h@xmath90 at late times , but they do not report a fwhm , so it is not clear if they are are also possibly referring to a noisy detection of the narrow nebular lines .",

    "this is similar to the spectral evolution of supernovae where it is attributed to an expanding and cooling photosphere . however , unlike supernovae , the features of asassn-15lh do not show traditional p - cyg profiles and become increasingly inconspicuous .",
    "for example , the + 30 day spectrum of sn2010gx exhibits pronounced features , whereas the + 39 day asassn-15lh spectrum is nearly featureless ( fig .",

    "we explored a variety of possible ions using the highly parameterized spectrum synthesis tool , ` syn++ ` @xcite , to determine whether blending of features could reproduce the spectral features and evolution of asassn-15lh , but were unsuccessful .    to our knowledge",

    "the hydrogen - poor slsn iptf13ehe exhibited h@xmath90 balmer emission with broad and narrow components + 251 days post maximum @xcite .",
    "however , no such lines are observed in asasn-15lh .",
    "interaction with h - poor csm ejected by rapidly rotating pulsational pair instability supernovae is possible @xcite , but the spectroscopic consequences of such interaction are poorly understood @xcite , and the timescales of variability observed in the uv strongly favor against this scenario ( section [ subsec : uv ] ) .",
    "a luminous central source over - ionizing expanding ejecta is a speculative , though attractive , scenario that may explain the spectroscopic evolution of asassn-15lh toward a featureless continuum . as there is no precedent for this scenario ,",
    "the specific spectral signatures are unclear .",

    "an analogous phenomenon may be variable uv absorption commonly seen in seyfert galaxies @xcite . in some cases variability in the form of absorption components appearing and disappearing , or decreasing outflow velocities @xcite , can result from changes in the ionizing flux @xcite .",
    "asassn-15lh may be an extreme version of these processes .    , the -4 day spectrum of the slsn 2010gx can be reproduced .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]      although the mechanisms behind slsne powered by a stellar - mass compact object@xmath105such as a magnetar@xmath105 and the tidal disruption and accretion of a star by a smbh do differ significantly , the basic physical process driving the light curves of these events may be similar .",
    "a central source of uv / x - ray radiation ( an accreting smbh or the pulsar wind nebula of a rapidly spinning neutron star , ns ) is absorbed by a dense column of gas , and downgraded into optical radiation , where the lower opacity allows the radiation to more readily escape .",
    "such a  reprocessing \" picture has been applied to explain both tdes ( @xcite ) and slsne ( @xcite ) .",
    "consider the characteristic timescale of the central engine in a magnetar - powered slsn and tde scenarios . in a magnetar - powered slsn ,",
    "the central engine lifetime is the magnetic dipole spin - down timescale of the magnetar : @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 ms , and @xmath109 are , respectively , the mass , initial spin period , and dipole surface magnetic field strength of the magnetar ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum energy of the engine is limited to the rotational energy of the ns , @xmath110 which can vary from @xmath111 erg for the minimum value of the spin - period set by the mass shedding limit , depending on the mass of the ns ( @xcite ) . in order to simultaneously explain the large radiated energy and duration of asassn-15lh with a magnetar , we require a maximally spinning neutron star ( @xmath112 ) and a relatively weak magnetic field @xmath113 g ( e.g. , @xcite , see also @xcite ) .    in the tde scenario ,",
    "the engine lifetime is uncertain , but is commonly attributed to the fall - back time of the most tightly bound stellar debris following the disruption ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the mass of the smbh and the star , respectively , and we have assumed a stellar mass - radius relationship @xmath117 appropriate to lower main - sequence stars .",
    "the maximum radiated energy is that liberated by the accretion of the half of the stellar mass which remains bound to the smbh , @xmath118 where the radiative efficiency for geometrically thin accretion varies from @xmath119 , depending on the spin of the smbh and its orientation relative to the angular momentum of the accreting gas .    in the tde scenario ,",
    "the energetics of asassn-15lh are reasonably accommodated by the accretion of a solar - mass star .",
    "however , the high mass smbh @xmath120 inferred from the host of asassn-15lh , would appear to predict a long duration of the transient @xmath121 2 year , inconsistent with the much shorter observed decay time of the first peak of a few weeks .",
    "this inconsistency could be solved by considering that a main - sequence star can only be disrupted by such a massive black hole if the smbh is _ spinning _ in a prograde direction with respect to the orbit of the disrupted star ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "precession of the star during the phase of tidal compression due to the bh spin may substantially enhance the spread in the energy distribution of the stellar debris as compared to the newtonian case , by partially aligning the direction of the hydrodynamic bounce with the velocity vector of the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "more tightly bound debris has a shorter orbital period , which could significantly speed - up the flare evolution timescale as compared to the newtonian gravity estimate in equation [ eq : tfb ] . though promising ,",
    "general relativistic numerical simulations are needed to confirm this possibility .",
    "in addition to possibly speeding up the flare evolution , the high bh spin required to explain asassn-15lh as a tde would ( i ) naturally result in a large value of the accretion efficiency @xmath122 , accounting for its high luminosity ; ( ii ) possibly aid in the process of debris circularization by inducing precession of the stellar debris streams ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "precession of the streams out of the orbital plane due to misaligned bh spin could also help make the geometry of the reprocessing material relatively spherical ( e.g. , @xcite ) , consistent with the low measured optical polarization of asassn-15lh reported by @xcite .",
    "in both the magnetar slsn and tde scenarios , uv / x - ray radiation from the central source may ionize its way through the ejecta at late times .",
    "this process can result in the direct escape of uv / soft x - ray radiation while having an indirect influence on the observed optical light curve by changing the ejecta opacity ( sec .",
    "@xmath123 ) .    approximating the ejecta as a homogeneously expanding sphere of mass @xmath124 , velocity @xmath125 cm s@xmath103 , and radius @xmath126 ,",
    "the neutral column density is @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the neutral fraction .",
    "this is much higher than the inferred x - ray absorption column of @xmath129 @xmath102 towards asassn-15lh , requiring a very low neutral fraction if the x - ray source is related to the optical transient .",
    "this is consistent with the very low n(hi ) inferred by @xcite from ly-@xmath45 .",
    "the ejecta from tdes and slsne are expected to have markedly different chemical composition . in a tde",
    "the ejecta has nearly solar composition ( e.g.  @xcite ) and the escape of soft x - rays is inhibited primarily by the bound - free opacity of neutral helium ( @xcite ) . by contrast , in a h - poor slsn , x - rays are blocked more severely by neutral oxygen and carbon ( @xcite ) .    a central engine with an uv / x - ray luminosity @xmath130 releases an energy @xmath131 in ionizing radiation on a timescale @xmath132 .",
    "if the ejecta contains a mass fraction @xmath133 of elements with atomic number @xmath134 , the radiation ionizes its way through the ejecta on a timescale @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 k is the temperature of electrons in the recombination layer and @xmath138 is the ratio of absorptive and scattering opacity in the ejecta @xcite .    for typical parameters and an engine similar to asassn-15lh with @xmath139 ergs , we have @xmath140 month in the case of a he - rich composition ( @xmath141 ) of a tde - like scenario . by contrast , for a co - rich composition of an exploding massive star ( @xmath142 ) , we have @xmath140 months , making break - out harder to achieve . in the latter case ,",
    "x - ray break - out is even less likely considering that the k - shell valence electrons of oxygen have a binding energy of @xmath143 kev , while the _ measured _ kev x - ray luminosity of asassn-15lh @xmath144 erg s@xmath103 is much less than the optical / uv luminosity ( in other words , the true value of @xmath145 to use in equation [ eq : tbo ] should be much lower than @xmath146 erg ) .",
    "we conclude that an ionization break - out could allow the escape of x - rays in the tde scenario , but is probably not sufficient to do so in the case of a h - poor supernova given the observed soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "the ionization of the ejecta reduces the bound - free opacity , allowing the escape to the observer of uv and x - ray radiation with energies _ above _ the ionization threshold .",
    "this process is unlikely to explain the observed uv re - brightening by itself , as even the highest frequency uv bands of _ swift_-uvot are below the first ionization energies of the most abundant elements ( h , he , c , o ) .",
    "however , an ionization break - out may have an indirect effect on the light - curve via the continuum opacity .    at early times",
    "the ejecta is largely neutral and the opacity at optical frequencies is dominated by electron scattering , while the opacity at uv frequencies is dominated by line transitions of metals .",
    "however , once the ejecta becomes ionized by the central engine , the electron scattering opacity will increase , while the uv opacity will decrease as the ionized atoms have fewer bound - bound transitions . therefore ,",
    "following ionization break - out we expect a shift of the peak of the spectral energy distribution from optical to uv frequencies .",
    "the appeal of this model is that a _ single _ central - engine timescale would naturally reproduce the double - peaked temporal structure of asassn-15lh , which has no analogue in previously observed tde or slsn light curves . as a comparison ,",
    "the tde model invoked by @xcite combines two luminosity mechanisms , which result into two different timescales .    while accurate modeling , beyond the scope of this paper , is necessary to understand if this effect alone can quantitatively explain the observations of asassn-15lh , here we consider a toy model to illustrate the basic principles . for illustrative purposes we use the spin down luminosity of a magnetar as the central source of ionizing photons .",
    "in particular , we consider a magnetar light - curve with parameters @xmath147 ms and @xmath148 g , similar to that described in @xcite , and a total ejecta mass of @xmath149 .",
    "however , we artificially change the grey opacity from @xmath150 @xmath151 g@xmath103 to @xmath152 @xmath151 g@xmath103 at a time corresponding to ionization break - out of about 50 days . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : opacity ] , this produces a minimum / flattening in the bolometric light curve , similar to that observed in asassn-15lh .",
    "although we have applied the model to a magnetar for concreteness ( and since the process of debris circularization in tdes remains uncertain ) , a similar result applies to the tde case if the central uv / x - ray accretion power smoothly rises on a timescale of a few weeks and then decays @xmath153 at later times .",
    "we also caution that a simple change in the grey opacity is unlikely to accurately predict the effect of wavelength - dependent opacity change created by an ionization break - out .",
    "we presented evidence for luminous , soft and persistent x - ray emission at the location of asassn-15lh , and discussed its origin in the context of multi - wavelength observations of the transient , which include constraints on its radio emission and early and late - time optical spectroscopy .",
    "our re - analysis of early - time spectra does not confirm the robust association of asassn-15lh with slsne claimed by previous studies , and invites us to be open - minded about the nature of asassn-15lh .",
    "late - time spectra reveal the emergence of _ narrow _ emission features from the host galaxy , while we associate the most prominent _ broad _ spectral features to the underlying stellar population .",
    "no clear evidence is found for broad spectral features associated with the transient at late times .",
    "we propose a model that explains the double - peaked temporal structure of asassn-15lh in the optical / uv band as originating from the temporal evolution of the ejecta opacity , which changes as a result of persistent ionizing flux from a long - lived central source ( either a magnetar or an accreting smbh ) .",
    "we speculate that the evolution of asassn-15lh towards a featureless spectrum also results from the presence of a persistent central source of ionizing photons .",
    "the exceptionally long active time - scale and high luminosity of the ionizing central source powering asassn-15lh ( i.e. months ) is most likely the key physical property that distinguishes asassn-15lh from all the tdes and slsne discovered so far .    the optical / uv spectral evolution of asassn-15lh , its peculiar re - brightening and the presence of soft and persistent x - ray emission are indeed unprecedented among slsne and tdes and suggest two scenarios : ( i ) either asassn-15lh is the first member of a class of stellar explosions with extreme properties that are intrinsically rare or that have been overlooked because of the very close location to the host - galaxy nucleus or , alternatively , ( ii ) asassn-15lh results from refreshed nuclear activity of the host - galaxy smbh .    in the first scenario the detected x - ray emission is physically unrelated to the transient and most likely originates from the host galaxy nucleus .",
    "we thus expect no fading of the x - ray source over the time scales of years .    instead ,",
    "if the x - ray emission is physically associated with the optical / uv transient , then asassn-15lh is unlikely to originate from a stellar explosion and an association with the activity of the host nucleus is favored . in this case",
    ", asassn-15lh would be a tde from the most massive spinning smbh observed to date .",
    "the fast initial decay timescale of the transient is challenging to understand based on the fall - back timescale of the disrupted star in newtonian gravity , possibly suggesting that bh spin plays a key role in enhancing the energy spread of the disrupted star . asassn-15lh and similar events discovered in the future",
    "would then constitute direct probes of matter under strong gravity around very massive , dormant , spinning smbh in galaxies .",
    "we emphasize that this scenario predicts significant temporal evolution of the x - ray emission over the next few years , as we expect a tde to have a non - negligible impact on the inner part of the accretion disk even in the case of a pre - existing weak agn",
    ".    continued deep x - ray monitoring of asassn-15lh will constrain the temporal evolution of the x - ray source and its fading , revealing in this way if the x - ray source is indeed physically related to the optical / uv transient .",
    "future x - ray observations thus hold the keys to unveil the true nature of asassn-15lh .",
