    "only in trivial cases , last hitting times are at the same time stopping times because the `` current- measurability '' requirement is usually not satisfied .",
    "hence it is typically harder to deal with last hitting times than with stopping times for which we know quite an impressive collection of theorems and tools .",
    "as chung ( see citation of nikeghbali and platen(2012 ) ) among others conclude , last hitting times must therefore be _ avoided at all costs .",
    "_    this is one way to see things , but one should admit that , often enough , reality looks somewhat different . indeed , ironically , many interesting problems in the theory of optimal stopping require us to deal with last hitting times , and not with stopping times . and so , the attitude has changed , and the work of jeulin ( 1980 ) and others had quite an influence on this development .    in their recent paper , nikeghbali and platen",
    "cite several interesting examples from the domain of mathematical finance . in order to add to the motivation",
    ", we would like to slightly broaden the horizon and look at a few other examples .",
    "best - choice problems , or secretary problems , are typical representatives of a last - hitting time problem , namely problems of stopping on the last `` improvement '' of a stochastic process . in some of these problems ,",
    "the difficulty stemming from the last - hitting time character disappears . to give a very simple example , suppose we observe sequentially variables @xmath1 and would like to maximize , for a given objective function @xmath2 the expected total return , that is we seek @xmath3 suppose now that the optimal payoff for stopping _ after _",
    "time @xmath4 does not depend on @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the natural filtration .",
    "then @xmath7 so that rhs as well as @xmath8 are both @xmath9-measurable .",
    "hence it suffices to compare at each time @xmath4 the value @xmath10 with the rhs supremum in order to take the optimal decision .    in more difficult problems",
    "the @xmath9-independence is typically no longer satisfied .",
    "however , external information about the underlying process may help us to change nevertheless the last - hitting time problem into a tractable stopping problem .",
    "see for example the _ last - arrival _ problem ( bruss and yor ( 2012 ) ) which is a continuous time problem , and where the relevant external information about the underlying process is implied by a related martingale",
    ". there may be other examples of such an approach .",
    "there are also certain other problems where the _ last _ hitting time objective is hiding behind other objectives , as for example the objective to discover the _ first _ time a random subset of a given set becomes complete .",
    "we give one specific example of this in the important field of clinical trials , more precisely , in so - called compassionate - use clinical trials .",
    "in such trials , a sequence of patients is treated with a drug ( sometimes without fda - approval ) which may have serious side effects , the only justification being that it may be the last hope .",
    "( these trials require a special written consent of patients . )",
    "treatments are typically sequential so that the physician or statistician may learn form preceding observations .",
    "a little reflection shows that these trials pose a difficult ethical problem .",
    "the conscientious physician should try to save all lives which can be saved , and , at the same time avoid all unnecessary sufferings caused by the treatment .",
    "since he or she is no prophet , the goal must be to stop ( in a given sequence of patients within a fixed horizon ) with maximum probability with the first patient completing the random subset of successes that is stop with the last success .",
    "indeed , then _ all _ successes are covered , whereas the remaining patients ( de facto not savable by the drug ) do not have to suffer unnecessarily .",
    "if the success probability for each patient is known beforehand , then the optimal strategy follows immediately from the odds - algorithm ( see bruss ( 2000 ) ) .",
    "however , the physician may have almost no information about the respective success probabilities , and then the general solution of the optimal stopping problem is an open problem .    these examples second the motivation of the studies of nikeghbali and platen , as well as ours in the present note .",
    "last - hitting times are often important .",
    "admittedly , no model in these papers seems tractable enough to deal for instance with the _ general _ compassionate - use stopping problem described above .",
    "however , this indicates that it may be worth trying to view last - hitting times from any possible angle , and this is what we try in this paper .",
    "our goal is to add to the understanding by looking at what can be done with enlargements of filtrations ( in this case together with girsanov s theorem ) , even though we confine our interest to special processes .    * ( 1.1 ) *  in their survey about last passage times , the nikeghbali and platen ( 2012 ) illustrate some of their formulae with the following example :    let @xmath11 be a bes(3)-process on @xmath12 starting from @xmath13 denote by @xmath14 its natural filtration , and let @xmath15 denote the current infimum of the process @xmath16 at time @xmath4 , that is , @xmath17 the following results can be found in nikeghbali and platen around corollary 4.10 :    \\(a ) @xmath18 follows the same distribution as the random variable @xmath19 where @xmath20 is uniform on @xmath21.$ ]    \\(b ) the azma - supermartingale associated with the random time @xmath22 at which the process @xmath23 reaches @xmath24 is given by @xmath25    \\(c ) the laplace transform of the law of @xmath22 is @xmath26    \\(d ) the density of @xmath22 denoted by @xmath27 equals @xmath28    our aim in the remaining part of this note is to show williams decomposition of a bes(3)-process at its ultimate minimum , and how this decomposition is closely connected with ( a)-(b)-(c)-(d ) .    *",
    "( 1.2 ) *  recall that if @xmath29 is a brownian motion starting from @xmath30 and @xmath31 is a real constant , then the law of the first hitting time of @xmath31 by @xmath32 denoted by @xmath33 is given by @xmath34this well - known fact allows us to rewrite the statements ( c ) and ( d ) above as @xmath35 where @xmath20 is independent of @xmath36 and uniform on @xmath21,$ ] and where @xmath37 denotes identity in law .",
    "this can be verified using ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "in fact , ( 2 ) may be understood via the classical decomposition of the process @xmath23 before and after time @xmath38 due to williams ( 1974 ) .",
    "* ( 2.1 ) *  figure 1 describes well the decomposition of a bes(3)-process .",
    "note that this figure is nothing else but a ( simulated finite - horizon ) version of the figure 5 in revuz - yor ( 1999 ) ( see proposition 3.10 and theorem 3.11 in ch .",
    "3 ) where the bes(3)-process is considered starting from level @xmath39    * ( 2.2 ) *   we now state precisely williams decomposition theorem before and after time @xmath40    * theorem 1 * ( williams ( 1974 ) )    consider the following three independent random objects :    \\(i )  a brownian motion @xmath41 with @xmath42    \\(ii )  a uniform random variable @xmath20 on @xmath21;$ ]    \\(iii )  a bes(3)-process @xmath43 with @xmath44    then the process @xmath23 defined by @xmath45 with @xmath46 is a bes(3)-process starting from @xmath13    we note that the pre-@xmath22-browian - motion found in ( 3 ) explains the result ( 2 ) . indeed , if @xmath47 then @xmath48 which implies ( 2 ) .",
    "* 2.3 *  we now proceed to the proof of the theorem via the enlargement formula which describes the additive decomposition of the bes(3)-process @xmath49 in the filtration @xmath50 containing the filtration @xmath51 and making @xmath22 a stopping time .",
    "firstly , we have @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a brownian motion with respect to the filtration @xmath54    secondly , the enlargement formula ( see e.g. jeulin ( 1980 ) ) yields @xmath55 with @xmath56 being a brownian motion with respect to @xmath57    thirdly , we deduce from ( b ) the two identities @xmath58 and @xmath59 these two identities imply ( using ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) ) , and also @xmath60 the form of the pre-@xmath22-process and the form of the post-@xmath22-process .    finally , for the proof of ( 3 ) to be complete , it remains to prove that the process @xmath61 is independent of the random variable @xmath62 or more precisely , that , given @xmath63 , the pre-@xmath22-process is just the process @xmath64 with obvious notation .",
    "this is asserted in the following proposition :      : the equality between the rhs of ( 8.1 ) and ( 8.3 ) follows , as we will show , from doob s absolute continuity relationship , namely@xmath72 on the canonical path - space @xmath73,{\\mathbb r}),$ ] where @xmath74 denotes the coordinate process on path - space .",
    "indeed , this equality may be extended when replacing the time @xmath4 by a stopping time .",
    "restricting @xmath75 on the set @xmath76 we get then in particular @xmath77 which yields the desired result",
    ".    identity ( 8.2 ) is obvious , since the equality @xmath78 holds @xmath66-almost surely .",
    "the proof of the equality ( 8.1 ) is slightly more subtle .",
    "we start with the identity @xmath79= e\\left[(1-z_t)\\,\\int_0^t\\varphi(i_s)d(1-z_s)\\right]\\eqno(9)\\ ] ] which holds for any borel - measurable function @xmath80 to see this , note that @xmath81={\\mathrm e}\\left[(1-z_t)\\varphi(i_t)\\right].\\ ] ] assuming @xmath82 the latter becomes by partial integration @xmath83+{\\mathrm e}\\left[\\int_0^t\\varphi(i_s)d(1-z_s)\\right].\\ ] ] we note that the expectation involving @xmath84 vanishes , since @xmath85 vanishes @xmath86 almost everywhere .",
    "thus a monotone class argument implies that ( 9 ) holds for every non - negative borel - measurable function @xmath87    next , from the additive decomposition of @xmath88 , we obtain @xmath89={\\mathrm e}\\left[\\int_0^t\\varphi(i_s)\\left(-\\frac{di_s}{i_s}\\right)\\right]={\\mathrm e}\\left[\\int_{i_t}^r\\varphi(a ) \\frac{da}{a}\\right].\\ ] ] since @xmath90 the latter can also be written as @xmath91 so that from ( 9 ) @xmath89={\\mathrm e}\\left(\\int_0^r \\varphi(a)\\frac{da}{a}{\\bf 1}_{\\ { t_a \\le t\\}}\\right ) \\eqno(10).\\ ] ] now note that the identity ( 10 ) still holds if we replace @xmath4 by a generic stopping time .",
    "applying again the monotone class theorem gives us then @xmath92={\\mathrm e}\\left [ \\int_0^r \\varphi(a ) \\frac{da}{a}\\phi_{t_a}{\\bf",
    "1}_{\\{t_a < \\infty\\}}\\right ] .",
    "\\eqno ( 11)\\ ] ] finally , using @xmath93 with @xmath20 being uniform on @xmath21 $ ] under @xmath66 ( see ( 2 ) ) , we see that identity ( 11 ) implies identity ( 8.1 ) .",
    "the statement of the theorem invites for a proof chosing between , on the one hand , initial enlargement with @xmath94 and , on the other hand , progressive enlargement with @xmath40 however we have not exactly proceeded like this ; the proposition plays the role of the initial enlargement method and relies on a classical girsanov relationship between @xmath66 and @xmath68 .    in conclusion",
    "we find it interesting to present the above as an example of the potential of enlargement techniques , and here specifically , of a melange of enlargement techniques and girsanov s theorem .",
    "having said so , we know that this approach can in priciple be done for higher dimensions ; however , the corresponding theorem 1 would look more complicated ."
