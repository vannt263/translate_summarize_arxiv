    "type ibn supernovae ( sne ibn ) are a class of transients whose spectra show narrow lines of he  i in emission and weak ( or no ) evidence of h lines @xcite .",
    "this is interpreted as evidence for the presence of a he - rich circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "in contrast to sne iin , whose csm is dominated by h , in sne ibn the outer environment is almost h - free .",
    "this implies that the progenitor stars of sne ibn already lost their h envelope , and also ( part of ) the he - rich layers at the time of their terminal explosion .",
    "as recent publications in the literature have pointed out , the number of sn ibn discoveries has significantly grown in the past few years .",
    "modern surveys with very large fields of view have led to an increase in detection rates and have removed the galaxy selection biases . with deeper imaging , and hence an increased sampled volume , sne ibn have also been discovered at relatively high redshifts .",
    "finally , more accurate typing criteria have significantly decreased the risk of mis - classifications .",
    "in fact , the discoveries of transitional sne ibn ( including the so - called sne ibn / iin , such as sne 2005la and 2011hw , that both show signatures of some circumstellar h along with he , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or sne ibn that evolve into sne ib ( e.g. asassn-15ed and sn  2015 g , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have shown that the classification of an object as a type ibn sn is sensitive to the epoch at which the spectrum is obtained . as a consequence ,",
    "a proper classification requires good - quality spectra obtained at multiple epochs .",
    "a major problem in sn ibn identification is that they usually explode in star - forming environments @xcite , hence their spectra are heavily contaminated by the complex host galaxy background .",
    "the rapid post - peak luminosity decline furthermore complicates their accurate characterization .",
    "in fact , most objects faded below the detection limit of optical telescopes within about 2 months @xcite , with at least one observed exception ( ogle-2012-sn-006 , which experienced an unusually slow photometric evolution , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the reason for the rapid evolution in the optical bands of most sne ibn is debated . in several cases , the rapid decline of the optical light curves",
    "was linked to a prompt condensation of dust in sn ejecta or in a cool dense shell ( cds , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in sn  2006jc , the prototype of this family ,",
    "this process was directly observed @xcite .",
    "sn  2006jc is a milestone for a number of reasons .",
    "first of all , it is still the only sn ibn for which a pre - sn outburst was observed ( by the amateur astronomer k. itagaki ) two years before the sn explosion @xcite .",
    "in addition , sn  2006jc was well monitored in the ultra - violet ( uv ) , optical and near - infrared ( nir ) bands since it was hosted by a nearby galaxy @xcite . for this reason , sn  2006jc is still the object that provided the most detailed information on this sn family ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a factor that is expected to affect the detection rate of sne ibn , which typically explode in star - forming galaxies , is their possible location in a dusty regions .",
    "however , no sn ibn affected by significant reddening has been discovered so far . the first opportunity to monitor an object of this class with strong line - of - sight extinction is psn  j07285387 + 3349106 . the discovery of this transient by the lick observatory supernova search ( loss)html / kait.html _ ] and its early follow - up information have been reported on the cbat _",

    "psn  j07285387 + 3349106 was classified by @xcite as a young type ibn event based on the presence of narrow emission lines of he  i. in addition , the detection of the strong , unresolved na  i doublet @xmath85889,5895 ( na  i d ) in absorption at the redshift of the host galaxy ( z = 0.01379 ) led ochner et al . to conclude that the sn was significantly reddened , with e(@xmath2)@xmath3 @xmath9 1 mag .",

    "this allows us to compute the oxygen abundance at the sn position , assuming a radial dependence as in @xcite .",

    "since the he  i line is still very weak in our earliest spectrum , it can be used to derive a more robust estimate despite its relatively poor signal - to - noise ( s / n ) . from this",

    "however , it is known that the relation between na  i d ew and e(@xmath2 ) has a large dispersion , especially when the interstellar extinction is high ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to account for this , we note that for ew larger than 4   , the sn sample of poznanski et al .",
    "spans a range of @xmath26 values from about 0.5 to 3 mag .",

    "another method to compute the foreground reddening , which is widely used for type ia sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , is through the comparison of sn colour curves at defined epochs . in the case of type ibn sne , this method is limited by the large heterogeneity of this class of transients .",
    "however , using the intrinsic colours of a limited number of sne ibn which are photometrically similar to psn  j07285387 + 3349106 ( see section [ lc ] for more details ) , we obtain a somewhat smaller value for the reddening , viz . e(@xmath2)@xmath3 = 0.81 @xmath1 0.21 mag .",

    "all of this suggests that the luminous peak of the light curve is powered by interaction with csm rather than a large amount of synthesized @xmath46ni .",
    "a number of authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that a fraction of interacting sne have early light curves powered by shock breakout in a dense wind .",
    "in fact , while the shock breakout emerging from the stellar surface has a very short duration ( of the order of minutes ) and releases uv and x - ray photons , the situation changes when the sn explodes within a dense circumstellar cocoon . in that case , the shock may propagate in the csm without immediately releasing photons to the observer . by the time the forward shock breaks out , it has accumulated a lot of energy which is released over much longer timescales than in the windless case .",
    "this mechanism may explain the luminous and long - lasting light curve peaks of a number of interacting sne embedded in a dense csm , as suggested by @xcite ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "the shock breakout model in a dense circumstellar wind has the advantage of explaining the enormous peak luminosity of psn  j07285387 + 3349106 , along with its relatively rapid photometric evolution with respect to the very slow evolutionary time scales of more extreme interacting sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a potential problem of this interpretation is the requirement of high csm densities . in order to produce such a dense csm ,",
    "the precursor star should have high mass - loss rate , from a few 10@xmath47 m@xmath48 yr@xmath6 to 10@xmath6 m@xmath48 yr@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these substantial mass - loss rates are expected in luminous blue variable ( lbv ) eruptions , and not in steady winds of the putative wolf - rayet progenitors of sne ibn @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , at least in the case of sn  2006jc , a residual lbv - like behaviour has been observed through the detection of a pre - sn burst in 2004 @xcite .",
    "a rather complex csm density profile and a variable mass - loss rate , ranging from 10@xmath6 m@xmath48 yr@xmath6 during the outburst to many orders of magnitude less before and after the 2004 episode , were proposed by @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that the shock breakout scenario in an optically thick csm has also been suggested for the type ibn sn iptf13beo @xcite .",
    "the shock breakout interpretation for this sn requires an enormous mass - loss ( about 2.4 m@xmath48 yr@xmath6 ) over a very short period .",
    "in other words , though unobserved , an lbv - like violent eruption is necessary also to explain the properties of iptf13beo .",
    "the ultimate verification of this scenario is the detection of pre - sn eruptions .",
    "so far , sn  2006jc is the only sn ibn for which a pre - sn eruption has been registered .",
    "however , pre - sn observations of the host galaxies are not available for most type ibn sne , or these sne are too distant to detect @xmath4914 mag pre - sn transient events .",
    "it is evident that routine observations of so - called `` sn impostors '' @xcite are essential to monitor extremely rare very massive stars that are approaching their final death as luminous sne .",
    "this strategy is complemented by panoramic surveys such as the _ intermediate palomar transient factory _ , _ la silla - quest _ , _ pan - starrs _ , the _ catalina real - time transient survey _ , and the _ skymapper southern sky survey _ which provide extensive databases of future sn explosion sites .",
    "these images will allow us to recover a posteriori the variability history of the progenitors of new interacting sne , as done for some recent sne iin @xcite .",
