    "the quantification and control of quantum entanglement , for quantum information processing purposes through teleportation@xcite and superdense coding@xcite , have derived extensive experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite researches in the recent decades .",
    "physically interesting in this area , solid state systems also have been used as a topic of many studies for their potential applications on transmitting a quantum state by using entanglement@xcite .",
    "particularly one - dimensional quantum spin systems comprise many nonclassical properties that make them interesting for studying spin entanglement .",
    "the magnetic behavior of these systems is explained through the isotropic heisenberg model or its special cases such as the ising , xy , and xxz models .",
    "in addition to many compounds with common isotropic heisenberg structure like @xmath2@xcite , @xmath3@xcite , and @xmath4@xcite , there are also some experimental examples such as @xmath5@xcite and @xmath6@xcite which are well described by ising and xy models respectively .",
    "it has been found that the systems with xy interaction can be used as quantum dots@xcite .",
    "therefore , many studies have been devoted to the exploration of important features of this model@xcite .",
    "also the fact that its eigenvalues can be exactly solved through the jordan - wigner ( jw ) transformation makes this model very practical@xcite .",
    "the zero - temperature quantum behavior of the spin-1/2 isotropic antiferromagnetic xy chain shows that it is in the luttinger liquid ( ll ) phase and undergoes a quantum phase transition by applying an external magnetic field@xcite . in the ll regime ,",
    "the 1n spins are entangled@xcite .",
    "increasing the magnetic field reduces the entanglement measure until the spins become completely disentangled in the magnetic fields larger than the quantum critical field , @xmath7 .    the thermal entanglement ( te )",
    "is of particular interest and demonstrates that the non - local correlations persist even in the thermodynamic limit@xcite . studying the te , zero - temperature entanglement , and the relation between the entanglement and the quantum phase transitions may lead to a relationship between the quantum information theory and the condensed matter physics .",
    "since the te can be experimentally verified via measurable macroscopic parameters@xcite , many efforts have been dedicated to quantify it .",
    "also , it has been recently demonstrated that an entangled pair of spins separated by several lattice spacing within an antiferromagnetic chain can be a suitable candidate for application in the quantum information processing@xcite .",
    "this work also highlights the importance of studying the te in different distances .    according to ref .",
    "[ ] , te of the 1n spins decreases by increasing the temperature .",
    "there is a critical temperature @xmath8 where te will be zero@xcite .",
    "it was found that the critical temperature is independent of the magnetic field .",
    "this property is not exclusive to the xy model , but it has been observed in other 1d spin-1/2 systems as well@xcite .",
    "in addition to the 1n spins , the zero - temperature entanglement between two spins at arbitrary distances was also studied using analytical and numerical calculations in the spin-1/2 xy chains@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that at zero temperature , the entanglement between the non - nearest neighbor spins becomes finite around the quantum critical field .",
    "the entanglement remains finite even if the distance between the spin pair reaches the system size@xcite .",
    "the concurrence and the quantum discord for the 2n spins were also studied in the ising and the xxz spin chains@xcite .",
    "it was found that the quantum correlations increases in the region close to the critical points .",
    "the scaling behavior of the quantum correlations between a spin pair at an farther distances in the xy chain has been investigated recently@xcite .",
    "it is shown that the quantum discord between the spin pairs positioned at distances further than two lattice spacing reveals a quantum phase transition . moreover ,",
    "the quantum discord may increase both with the temperature and the magnetic field in certain regions of the parameter space .    in this paper",
    ", we study an infinite 1d spin-1/2 isotropic xy model in the presence of a magnetic field . using the jw transformation",
    ", we find an analytical solution for the te between the 2n , 3n , and 4n spin pairs in the thermodynamic limit . in absence of the magnetic field ,",
    "the non - nearest neighbor pairs are not entangled .",
    "they remain unentangled until the magnetic field reaches the critical value @xmath9 which depends on the distance between the spins .",
    "we show that the @xmath9 is a function of @xmath10 . by",
    "further increasing the magnetic field , the entanglement between the 2n , 3n , and 4n spin pairs increases to a maximum value before settling to zero at the quantum critical field , @xmath10 . by taking the temperature into account ,",
    "the concurrence within 2n , 3n , and 4n pairs decreases and reaches zero at a magnetic field dependent on critical value @xmath1 .",
    "note that this critical temperature was found to be field - independent for the 1n spins@xcite .",
    "@xmath1 is maximum at the quantum critical field value . for the magnetic fields larger than the quantum critical value",
    ", two critical temperatures can be found .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and the hamiltonian which is diagonalized by using the jw transformation . in section [ sec3 ] , we discuss our results on the thermal behavior of the concurrence between the 2n , 3n , and 4n spins . in section [ sec4 ] a conclusion and the summary of the results",
    "is presented .",
    "the hamiltonian of a 1d spin-1/2 isotropic xy model in a external magnetic field is written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spin-1/2 operator of the @xmath13-th site .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling and @xmath15 is the magnetic field .",
    "we use the jw transformation to diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "it converts the spin operators into spinless fermion operators as below :    @xmath16     + by performing this transformation , the hamiltonian is mapped onto the hamiltonian of a 1d non - interacting fermionic system , @xmath17 using the fourier transformation @xmath18 , the momentum space hamiltonian is diagonalized as @xmath19 @xmath20 is the dispersion relation : @xmath21",
    "we focus on the entanglement between two sites , which is quantified by the concurrence . as defined below the concurrence",
    "measures the non - local quantumness of the correlations@xcite .",
    "@xmath22    where @xmath23s are square roots of the eigenvalues of the product matrix @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the reduced density matrix related to any ( i , j ) pair in the chain .",
    "@xmath27s are real and non - negative even though @xmath28 is not necessarily hermitian@xcite .",
    "the reduced density matrix contains all information about the involved spins .",
    "the density matrix in the standard basis , @xmath29 , can be expressed as : @xmath30 the brackets symbolize the ground state and the thermodynamic average values at zero and a finite temperature , respectively .",
    "@xmath31 , and @xmath32 . following the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian",
    ", the density matrix must be real and symmetrical@xcite .",
    "it is found that only some elements of the density matrix are non - zero@xcite : @xmath33 by considering the spin pair @xmath34 at the distance @xmath35 from each other , @xmath36 , the density matrix elements can be obtained as :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the occupation number operator . therefore , the concurrence between this spin pair is : @xmath39 the @xmath40 case has been discussed in ref .",
    "gong and su have derived an equation for a unique @xmath1 so that the 1n spins are entangled at temperatures lower than @xmath1 .",
    "here we study the concurrence of the 2n , 3n , and 4n spins only .",
    "for these cases @xmath41 and @xmath42 are obtained as follows : @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 where for the non - negative integer number @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48 is the fermi distribution function , where @xmath49 and the boltzmann constant @xmath50 .",
    "( [ zx2 ] ) , eq .  ( [ zx3 ] ) , and eq .  ( [ zx4 ] )",
    "are obtained using the wick s theorem@xcite .    in a system with a fixed exchange coupling , these integrals depend on two control parameters , i.e. temperature ( @xmath51 ) and magnetic field ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "a particular interesting case is study of the quantum correlation between the 2n , 3n , and 4n spins at zero temperature .",
    "fig.[zero temperature ] depicts the analytically calculated concurrence as a function of the magnetic field . note",
    "that although the 2n , 3n , and 4n spin pairs follow the same trend in figs.[zero temperature](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) the concurrence measure decreases by increasing the distance . also none of the pairs is entangled in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "they remain unentangled up to a critical entangled - field , @xmath0 .",
    "fig.[zero temperature ] shows that @xmath0 for the 4n spins is closer to the quantum critical field value than the other two spin pairs .",
    "it is notable that there is a relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "our results show that the critical entangled - field is @xmath52 and approximately @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the 2n , 3n , and 4n pairs respectively . based on these results ,",
    "one may propose a general relation for @xmath9 as a function of the distance and @xmath10 as @xmath55 . according to this relation and in agreement with the results from the finite size system@xcite",
    ", it seems that all neighbors are entangled in the vicinity of the quantum critical field .",
    "increasing the magnetic field above the @xmath0 induces entanglement between the non - nearest neighbor spins .",
    "this entanglement that is induced by the external magnetic field , is known as the `` magnetic entanglement '' and was reported in finite size systems for the first time @xcite . here",
    "we explicitly showed that this phenomenon is also observed in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "furthermore , the concurrence increases to a maximum value before falling to zero at the quantum critical field , @xmath10 . in the saturated ferromagnetic phase , @xmath56 ,",
    "the non - nearest neighbor spins are not entangled similar to the 1n spins .",
    "we also calculated the spin - spin correlation functions @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "we found that the spin - spin correlation functions along the @xmath59 and @xmath60 directions dominate the correlations along the @xmath61 direction exactly at the critical entangled - field .",
    "we have also calculated the concurrence between the 2n spins in finite size chains by using the numerical lanczos method .",
    "the numerical results for chain sizes @xmath62 are plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ zero temperature ]  ( a ) .",
    "although the effect of the level - crossing is seen in the finite size results , there is a region where the 2n spins will be entangled by the magnetic field .",
    "this is in agreement with the exact analytical results .    to obtain a better insight into the nature of the entanglement between the non - nearest neighbor spins",
    ", we consider the thermal behavior of the entanglement as a general case .",
    "[ hc ] shows the temperature dependence of the concurrence between the 2n ( figs .",
    "[ hc ] ( a ) and ( b ) ) , 3n ( figs .",
    "[ hc ] ( c ) and ( d ) ) , and 4n ( figs .",
    "[ hc ] ( e ) and ( f ) ) spins for different values of the magnetic field @xmath63 .",
    "[ hc ] ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( e ) show the results for @xmath64 .",
    "the 2n , 3n , and 4n spins are entangled at zero temperature in this region . by increasing the temperature , the entanglement decreases and vanishes at a critical value @xmath1 .",
    "the existence of a critical temperature is also reported for concurrence between the 1n spins in this model@xcite . here , the critical temperature is a function of the magnetic field strength and increases when the magnetic field approaches the quantum critical value .",
    "it is interesting that the critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) has a maximum exactly at @xmath65 . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum value of the critical temperature for the 3n spins in this model is almost one - third of the maximum value of the critical temperature for the 2n spins and three times larger than the maximum value of the critical temperature for 4n spins . by comparing figs.[hc ] ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( e )",
    "we conclude that the entanglement is formed step by step from the 2n , to the 3n and to farther neighbors in the spin chain by reducing the temperature .",
    "so the 4n spins are entangled at a lower temperature than the other two pairs .    for the magnetic fields greater than the quantum critical value ( figs .",
    "[ hc ] ( b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) ) the 2n , 3n , and 4n spins are not entangled at zero temperature . by increasing the temperature from zero",
    ", the spins remain unentangled until the first critical temperature @xmath66 is reached .",
    "once the temperature exceeds @xmath67 , the concurrence regains and takes a maximum value , then decreases to zero at the second critical temperature @xmath68 .",
    "the existence of the second critical temperature is expected , since a sufficiently large thermal fluctuation will destroy all of the classical and quantum correlations .",
    "both of the @xmath67 and @xmath69 values increase by increasing the external magnetic field .",
    "we have to mention that the same phenomenon has been observed for the concurrence between the 1n spins in this region of the magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the only difference is that the second critical temperature for the concurrence between the 1n spins is almost field - independent .",
    "also note that the entangled region beyond the @xmath10 is very limited for the 3n and 4n spins and diminishes quickly after @xmath70 in both cases .",
    "[ t - h ] depicts the t - h phase diagram for ( a ) 2n , ( b ) 3n , and ( c ) 4n pairs . also fig .",
    "[ t - h ] ( d ) shows an overview of the entangled regions for the 2n , 3n , and 4n pairs .",
    "these diagrams signify that there is no entanglement at any temperature interval in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "the borders of each entangled region determine critical temperatures in each magnetic field .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath71 and @xmath72 has an incremental behavior in @xmath73 for all three pairs . for @xmath56 , however the increasing trend of @xmath74",
    "can be observed for the 2n , 3n , and 4n pairs .",
    "@xmath72 shows a different behavior and @xmath72 is almost independent of the magnetic field for the 2n spins , while it decreases with h for the 3n and 4n .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ t - h ] ( d ) , one can easily conclude that increasing the magnetic field and decreasing the temperature leads to the induction of entanglement on the farther neighbor spins .",
    "therefore , all pairs are entangled around the @xmath10 at zero temperature .    the complete phase diagram of the concurrence between the 2n , 3n , and 4n spins in the spin-1/2 xy chains in a magnetic field is plotted in figs .",
    "[ c - t - h ] ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) using the exact analytical results .",
    "the concurrence reduces by increasing the temperature in all of the mentioned spin pairs",
    ". however , the concurrence magnitude and the thermal interval of the entangled region for the 3n and 4n spins are considerably smaller than the 2n spins .",
    "in this work we proposed a generalizable method for calculating the te between any arbitrary pair of spins in low - dimensional spin chains via the analytical jw transformation .",
    "we exactly resolved the concurrence between the 2n , 3n , and 4n spins in the spin-1/2 xy chains in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we found that all of the spin pairs are entangled at zero temperature where @xmath75 .",
    "we also showed that the critical entangled - field , @xmath9 , is a fraction of the quantum critical value .",
    "the critical entangled - field is @xmath76 for 2n spins and @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the 3n and 4n spins respectively .",
    "furthermore , we studied the temperature dependence of the concurrence between the 2n , 3n , and 4n spins .",
    "it is found that the thermal entanglement becomes finite only after @xmath15 crosses @xmath9 value .",
    "when @xmath15 increases beyond the critical point @xmath7 , the entanglement is still non - zero and decays gradually which is different from the ground state .",
    "the entangled field region is smaller at higher temperatures .",
    "furthermore , unlike the 1n spins entanglement , there is not any unique critical temperature for the non - nearest neighbor spins .",
