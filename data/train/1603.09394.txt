    "[ fig:3c ] and [ fig:3d ] , the behavior is even richer than for the kerr conductance . while the set of primary antiresonances follows the discussion above , a pair of sidelobe resonances surrounding each primary resonance is also observed .",
    "these sidelobe resonances result from the fact that the @xmath99 and @xmath102 terms in the expression for the conductance ( [ eq : gacy]c ) have the opposite sign of the @xmath97 term .",
    "thus , for certain non - zero values of the illumination factor @xmath113 , the positive and negative thermal factor contributions exactly cancel and the sidelobe antiresonances manifest themselves . because the exact value of the thermal factor functions change with temperature , the locations of these sidelobe antiresonances also shift with temperature .",

    "the oscillatory nature of these curves highlights the interplay between the thermal factor ( and thermal factor cancellation in the case of the third - harmonic conductance ) , state blocking , and the illumination factor .",
    "while the overall envelope of the @xmath116 conductances decay with increasing frequency as expected ( generally following the results for the @xmath117 case ) , there is clearly a richness in the detailed oscillatory behavior governed by the exact characteristics of the illumination and sample geometries .",
    "similar effects are noted in figs .",
    "[ fig:4c ] and [ fig:4d ] for the anisotropic nonlinear conductances as well .",
    "it is also useful to point out here that it should be possible to modify this dynamical behavior by apodizing@xcite the applied thz electric field .",

    "<S> we use time dependent perturbation theory to study quantum size effects on the terahertz nonlinear response of metallic graphene armchair nanoribbons of finite length under an applied electric field . </S>",
    "<S> our work shows that quantization due to the finite length of the nanoribbon , the applied field profile , and the broadening of the graphene spectrum all play a significant role in the resulting nonlinear conductances . in certain cases , </S>",
    "<S> these effects can significantly enhance the nonlinearity over that for infinitely - long metallic armchair graphene nanoribbon . </S>"
