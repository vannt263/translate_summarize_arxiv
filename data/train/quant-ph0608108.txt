    "a realistic quantum system can rarely be isolated from its surrounding environment ( or called the bath \" ) completely wheeler , open . when it is coupled to the bath with a large number of degrees of freedom",
    ", decoherence happens .",
    "there usually are two distinct decoherence effects of the bath on the quantum system : when the energy exchange is allowed by the interaction between the open system and the bath , the system energy usually dissipates into the environment irreversibly and we name this effect by quantum dissipation @xcite ; another effect is entitled by quantum dephasing , which occurs with no energy exchange , but an irreversible process of information loss happens in the considered open system @xcite .",
    "as to quantum dissipation , the well - known fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite reveals to what extent the bath fluctuation depends on the quantum dissipation process of the open system , or how the phenomenological damping rate is determined microscopically by the random couplings to the degrees of freedom of the bath . as to quantum dephasing , however , there does not exist a similar statement clarified for the quantum decoherence only with dephasing and without loss of energy .",
    "this paper is devoted to find the intrinsic relation between the pure dephasing and the some random nature of the bath .",
    "we begin with a general dephasing model for an open system interacting with a bath of many harmonic oscillators via a coupling of quantum non - demolition @xcite .",
    "this model is known to be universal in weak coupling limit @xcite . here",
    ", we characterize the dynamic process of dephsing with the so called decoherence factor , which linearly accompanies the off - diagonal elements of time evolution of the reduced density matrix for the system obtained by tracing over the variables of the bath .",
    "we find that the decoherence factor is a product of two factors , one of which is determined by the excitations of the bath while another does not vanish for the bath initially in vacuum state .",
    "this observation clearly indicates that there exist two sources of quantum dephasing , which originate from both the vacuum quantum fluctuation and the thermal excitations of the heat bath respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe a universal model for quantum open system interacting with a bath of many bosons through non - demolition couplings . in section iii",
    ", we show that a factorization structure appears in the dynamic dephasing process of the quantum open system . in section iv , we present the central result of this paper , i.e. , the relation between dephasing and the fluctuation of the bath . in the section v , we study the dephasing of the quantum open system while the bath is in thermal equilibrium state .",
    "finally , in the last section we conclude this paper with the remarks about the relationship between the quantum dephasing and the generalized thermalization due to the entanglements of the system with the bath .",
    "in general , quantum dephasing process is microscopically considered as the vanishing of off - diagonal elements of the time evolution of reduced density matrix of an open system interacting with its surrounding environment or bath of infinite degrees of freedom .",
    "the simplest model is the composite system consisting of a system interacting with the bath of infinite bosons @xcite .     spanned by the transition operators @xmath0 from the ground state @xmath1 . , width=188 ]    the model hamiltonian @xmath2is decomposed into three parts , the system part @xmath3 the bath part @xmath4 with the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) for the mode of frequencies @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and the interaction between the quantum open system and the bath @xcite @xmath9where we assume that @xmath10 has the dimension of energy .",
    "the operator - volumed coupling @xmath11 depends on the system variables . to conserve the energy of the open system ,",

    "the mode number @xmath15 may be infinite for a macroscopic heat bath .",
    "we assume that the system can be embedded into a @xmath20dimensional space with an extended basis vector @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "fig-1 ) where the transition operators @xmath22 has commutation relations with the projection operators @xmath23 @xmath24=\\delta _ { mn}\\phi _ { n}.\\ ] ]    a typical example of this model is that the open system is a single mode boson with hamiltonian @xmath25 defined by the bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operator @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) for the mode of frequency @xmath28 . the interaction @xmath29h.c.@xmath30 between the boson and the bath @xcite",
    "was frequently used to give a quantum approach for measurement of boson state .",
    "it originates from the generic oscillator coupling of the system coordinate @xmath31 to the bath variables @xmath32 , i.e. ,    @xmath33\\ ] ]    in a large detuning limit @xmath34 .",
    "we can exactly solve the heisenberg equation for the operators @xmath35 and @xmath6@xmath36with the quantum noise operator @xmath37here , the noise operator satisfies the brownian conditions in @xmath38 and @xmath39 in an equilibrium state @xmath40 and the thermodynamic average @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42    since @xmath11 is conservable or @xmath43 , we explicitly obtain @xmath44where the phase operator in @xmath45 reads @xmath46\\]]and @xmath47 .",

    "to demonstrate the dynamic process of quantum dephasing of the open system , we now calculate reduced density matrix for the time evolution of the open system .",
    "a pure dephasing process means that the off - diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the open system vanish , while the diagonal elements remain unchanged in such an ideal case .",
    "usually the off - diagonal elements depend on both the initial state and the dynamic variables of the bath and it can vanish in the thermodynamic limits .",

    "in summary , through a universal model for a quantum open system with non - demolition coupling to the bath , we find the intrinsic relation between the dephasing of the open system and the quantum and thermal fluctuation of its bath .",
    "usually , the couplings of a quantum open system to its environment is very complicated , and then intuitively the dephasing process should depend on the details of system - bath couplings .",
    "so generally the present model used in this paper seems to be too oversimplified .",
    "however , we would like to mention the caldeira and leggett s studies about quantum dissipation @xcite , which proves that any bath with weak couplings to the open system can be modeled as a collection of non - interacting bosons . as for the quantum dephasing",
    ", we even found a similar conclusion to universally consider the quantum dephasing problem in quantum computing sun - zhan - liu .",
    "thus the present investigation can also be considered to be universal , and dephasing process is generally clarified as the two kinds of origins , the quantum fluctuation in the vacuum and the thermal excitation in finite temperature .    before concluding this paper , it is necessary to say some words about the repletion and difference between the dynamic dephasing process studied in this paper and the thermalization to the thermal equilibrium induced by the bath @xcite .",
    "first , we have to note that the dephasing process in this paper can describe the thermal equilibrium with canonical state in a straightforward way",
    ". most recently people revisit the investigation to _ _",
    "_ _ explore the possibility replacing the equal a prior probability postulate in statistical mechanics by a general canonical principle @xcite : an arbitrary entangling pure state of the total system consisting of the small `` system plus large bath '' can be traced over the variables of the bath to give a generalized canonical state due to the large number law `` or overwhelming majority of wave functions in the subspace by obeying some global constraint for the universe '' .",
    "actually , if this global constraint is particularly determined by the energy interval encompassed by the microcanonical ensemble , the above mentioned tracing \" operation just results in the thermal equilibrium distribution .",
    "such thermalization process can also be described as a typical quantum dissipation phenomenon , a dynamically quantum process with energy exchange between the system and the bath @xcite .",
    "however , there is not energy exchange in our present dephasing model and thus it give rise to a mixture rather than the thermal equilibrium distribution .",
    "maybe there exist another type global constraint other than the energy interval , we believe that it is an open question , which could be solved in a general framework .",
