    "this talk consists of two independent parts , both related to novel aspects of the correlations and event - by - event fluctuations present in the commonly used glauber treatment of the early phase of the ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the standard way of generating the nucleon distribution in a nucleus for studies of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions is to _ independently _ populate the nucleus according to a one - body density in the form of the woods - saxon function .",
    "thus , the typically used procedure completely neglects the nn _ correlations _ ( apart for the poor man s implementation of the hard - core repulsion , precluding the centers of the nucleons to be closer than a certain distance ) , known to be crucial in a nuclear system . recently",
    ", however , alvioli , drescher , and strikman @xcite published nuclear distributions for several nuclei which fully account for the central two - body nn correlations , thus accomplishing the long - awaited task @xcite .    in this work",
    "we use the distributions from @xcitemalvioli / eventgenerator ] in glissando @xcite to investigate within the glauber treatment the role of the nn correlations on several signatures of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we use the wounded - nucleon model @xcite , however we have checked that the results in other variants @xcite of the glauber approach are qualitatively similar .",
    "such more detailed studies will be published elsewhere .",
    "we recall that the nucleons from the two nuclei get wounded when their centers pass closer to each other than the distance @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section . for the highest sps , rhic , and lhc energies it is equal to 32 , 42 , and 63  mb , respectively .",
    "+   +    our results for the @xmath4 collisions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] .",
    "the notation is as follows : @xmath5 - the total ( projectile+target ) number of wounded nucleons , @xmath6 - the number of wounded nucleons in the projectile , and @xmath7 denotes the number of the wounded - nucleon pairs .",
    "we note that except for the fluctuations of the total number of the wounded - nucleon pairs plotted as a function of the wounded nucleons in the projectile ( the na49 setup @xcite , where the veto calorimeter essentially measures @xmath6 ) , other investigated quantities are not affected by the inclusion of the nn correlations . while for the one - body observables from the left - side panels this is expected , as two - body correlations by definition do not affect one - body observables , the weakness of the effect in the fluctuation of the eccentricities @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite is somewhat surprising . our conclusions for @xmath8 agree with similar observations drawn in @xcite .",
    "we conclude that apart for the multiplicity fluctuations , the neglect of the nn correlations in numerous previous studies of relativistic heavy - ion collisions was innocuous .",
    "in particular , the previous studies of @xmath0 and its fluctuations are not affected by the nn correlations in the nucleon distributions .",
    "the @xmath10 fluctuations in relativistic heavy - ion collisions have been a subject of intense studies . despite numerous theoretical efforts , up to now",
    "the magnitude and centrality dependence of these correlations has not been convincingly understood . in this part of the talk we present a very simple mechanism , capable of describing very well the data .",
    "the approach is described in a greater detail in @xcite .",
    "it generates the event - by - event @xmath10-fluctuations based on the fluctuations of the initial size of the formed system and its subsequent hydrodynamic evolution followed by statistical hadronization ( we use the single - freeze - out variant from @xcite ) . due to its statistical nature",
    ", the glauber approach leads to an initial configuration of the wounded nucleons ( or binary collisions ) which are randomly distributed .",
    "this promptly yields the fluctuations of the initial transverse size . in short , this is the scheme : _ smaller initial size has more compression , leading to faster hydrodynamic expansion , larger flow at freeze - out , and , finally , larger transverse momenta _ , and vice versa .",
    "we note that the effects of inhomogeneities in the initial condition for some observables have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the event - by - event fluctuations of the initial shape have been studied in detail for its elliptic component , where they cause enhancement of the elliptic flow .",
    "we define the average transverse size ( in the wounded nucleon model for the simplicity of notation ) as @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are coordinates of a wounded nucleon in the transverse plane .",
    "the original positions of nucleons in each nucleus are randomly generated from an appropriate woods - saxon distribution .",
    "the notation @xmath14 indicates averaging over the events . in order to focus on the relative size of the effect we use the scaled standard deviation , defined for a fixed value of @xmath5 as @xmath15 .",
    "the results of our monte carlo simulations for @xmath16 performed with glissando @xcite in the wounded nucleon model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : basic ] .",
    "the three curves overlap , showing insensitivity to the value of @xmath3 in the considered range .",
    "we note that the scaled standard deviation of @xmath17 is about 2 - 3% for central collisions , and grows towards the peripheral collisions approximately as @xmath18 .",
    "qualitatively very similar results are obtained for other variants , in particular for the mixed model and models with superimposed distribution of particles produced by each wounded nucleon @xcite .",
    "we have also checked that using a gaussian wounding profile @xmath19 @xcite for the nn collision , rather than the sharp wounding distance criterion applied here , leads to indistinguishable curves .",
    "also , the use of the nucleon distributions including realistically the nn correlations , as described in the first part of this talk , leads to practically no difference .",
    "in other words , the behavior displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : basic ] is robust , reflecting the random nature of the glauber approach .",
    "the next step , crucial in converting the size fluctuation into the observable momentum fluctuations , is hydrodynamics .",
    "we use the hydrodynamic approach of @xcite , followed with statistical hadronization as implemented in therminator @xcite .",
    "the goal is to find how exactly the size fluctuations get converted into the @xmath10 fluctuations . rather than doing tedious event - by - event hydrodynamic calculations , it is enough to see how much the results change when the size of the initial profile is scaled .",
    "the procedure presented below works , since the studied fluctuations follow from the initial conditions , while the differential equations of hydrodynamics are deterministic .",
    "the event - by - event distribution of @xmath17 is approximately gaussian , @xmath20 suppose first that we run the simulations at a fixed value of @xmath17 and as the result obtain a certain average transverse momentum , @xmath21 .",
    "because of the deterministic nature of hydrodynamics , @xmath21 is a ( very complicated ) function of @xmath17 .",
    "its value fluctuates because of the fluctuations of the initial size .",
    "now , we can expand near the central value : @xmath22 substituting ( [ fexp ] ) into ( [ fr ] ) and comparing to ( [ fp ] ) we get the key formula @xmath23 or , for the scaled standard deviation , @xmath24    the full statistical distribution @xmath25 is a folding of the statistical distribution of @xmath1 at a fixed initial size , centered around @xmath21 , with the distribution of @xmath21 centered around @xmath26 . in the central regions both are close to gaussian distributions , hence we have , to a very good approximation , @xmath27 carrying out the @xmath28 integration yields the gaussian event - by - event distribution of @xmath1 centered around @xmath29 with the width parameter satisfying @xmath30 .",
    "statistical procedures used in experimental analyses of fluctuations are designed in such a way that the dynamical component of the fluctuations is extracted . in our case , where the source of fluctuations is in the initial condition , we find the simple formula  ( [ sigsig ] ) , which may be compared to the experimental @xmath31 .    the derivative in eqs .",
    "( [ sigsig],[sigsig2 ] ) can be computed numerically without difficulty by running just two simulations at each centrality .",
    "we perform calculations for initial profiles which are squeezed or stretched by 5% .",
    "in addition to squeezing or stretching , we also simultaneously adjust the central temperature in such a way , that the energy contained in the profile is preserved .",
    "this is natural , as the total energy deposited in the transverse plane should be the same ( up to possible additional fluctuations neglected here ) for a given number of elementary collisions .",
    "thus , we include in some sense also the temperature fluctuations discussed , _",
    "e.g. _ , in @xcite .",
    "our final result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] , where we compare the model points to the data from the star @xcite and phenix @xcite collaborations .",
    "the experimental cuts of the star detector have been used in our model simulations , @xmath32 .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] , we note a strikingly good agreement between our calculation and the experiment , in particular for the wounded nucleon model . the mixed model , admittedly more realistic than the wounded - nucleon model , overshoots the data by about 20% .",
    "this suggests that the coefficient in ( [ sigsig2 ] ) is somewhat too large .",
    "its value incorporates all the dynamics of the system ( the choice of the initial profile , details of hydrodynamics , the statistical hadronization ) , hence modifying any of these components , _",
    "e.g. _ including viscosity effects , will lead to changes .",
    "we note a proper dependence on centrality , with an approximate dependence @xmath33 . since the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : basic ] very weakly depend on @xmath3 , to the extent that the hydrodynamic `` pushing '' is similar at various energies , our results should also weakly depend on the incident energy , which is a desired experimental feature in view of the star results .    finally , we note that the result ( [ sigsig2 ] ) bears similarity to the formula derived by ollitrault @xcite , where @xmath34 with @xmath35 denoting the entropy density , @xmath36 - the pressure , and @xmath37 - the energy density .",
    "the second equality follows from the assumption that the total entropy deposited in the transverse plane depends only on the number of collisions and not on the size , hence @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ olli ] ) is to be understood in the averaged sense over space and time .",
    "numerically , we find @xmath40 independent of centrality .",
    "this yields the average @xmath39 about 0.2 , which is in the expected ball park of realistic equations of state @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pe ] .",
    "here are our main conclusions :    1 .",
    "the inclusion of the two - body nn correlations is important for the fluctuations of the number of produced particles .",
    "other observables , such as the shape eccentricity fluctuations , carried over to the @xmath0 fluctuations , are not affected .",
    "we reproduce the dynamical event - by - event @xmath10 fluctuations , as measured at rhic by star and phenix , with the simple mechanism based on fluctuations of the initial size , which are then carried over by hydrodynamics to the fluctuations of the transverse flow velocity , and consequently to the transverse momentum of the produced particles .",
    "the hydrodynamic `` push '' is crucial in this scheme .",
    "other possible sources of fluctuations , such as the formation of clusters at freeze - out @xcite , minijets @xcite , or correlations originating from the elementary nn collisions in the corona in the core - corona picture @xcite , should all be considered at the `` background '' of the fluctuations described in this talk .",
    "the hydrodynamic push is related to the equation of state , in particular to the ratio @xmath39 averaged over space and time .",
    "thus , interestingly , the @xmath10 correlations carry , via their relation to the size fluctuations , information on the stiffness of the medium .",
    "one of us ( wb ) is grateful to jeff mitchell for a discussion on the phenix data and the conversion formulas for various measures of fluctuations , and to jean - yves ollitrault for communicating to us the result of eq .",
