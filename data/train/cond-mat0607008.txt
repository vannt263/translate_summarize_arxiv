    "the transfer - matrix method has an advantage over the monte carlo method in that it provides information free from the statistical ( sampling ) error and the problem of slow relaxation to thermal equilibrium . on one hand , the tractable system size with the transfer - matrix method",
    "is severely limited , because the transfer - matrix size increases exponentially as the system size @xmath3 enlarges ; here , @xmath3 denotes the number of spins constituting a unit of the transfer - matrix slice .",
    "such a limitation becomes even more serious in large dimensions ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "actually , for large @xmath5 , the system size @xmath6 increases rapidly as the linear dimension @xmath7 enlarges , and it soon exceeds the limit of available computer resources . because of this difficulty , the usage of the transfer - matrix method has been restricted mainly within @xmath8 .    in this paper , we report an attempt to eliminate the finite - size corrections of the @xmath0 ising model by tuning the interactions parameters . as anticipated ,",
    "such an elimination of corrections admits systematic finite - size - scaling analysis of the numerical data with restricted system sizes . to be specific , we consider the @xmath0 ising ferromagnet with the extended interactions , @xmath9 } s_i s_j s_k s_l   , \\ ] ] where the ising spins @xmath10 are placed at the cubic - lattice points specified by the index @xmath11 ; the summations @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14}$ ] run over all nearest - neighbor pairs , next - nearest - neighbor ( plaquette diagonal ) spins , and round - a - plaquette spins , respectively . within the extended parameter space @xmath15 , we search for a regime of eliminated corrections to scaling . for that purpose , we consider a real - space renormalization group for a couple of clusters , whose thermodynamics is simulated with the transfer - matrix method ; see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "we then determine a location of the renormalization - group fixed point .",
    "following this preliminary renormalization - group survey , we perform extensive transfer - matrix simulation around this fixed point .",
    "thereby , we show that the corrections - to - scaling behavior is improved around the fixed point . here",
    ", we utilized an improved version of the transfer - matrix method @xcite , and succeeded in treating a variety of system sizes @xmath16 ; note that conventionally , the tractable system sizes are restricted to @xmath17 .",
    "apparently , such an extension of available system sizes provides valuable information on criticality .    in fairness , it has to be mentioned that our research owes its basic idea to the following pioneering studies : first , an attempt to eliminate the finite - size corrections was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors investigate the @xmath0 ising model with the ( finely - tuned ) second and third neighbor interactions ; see also the studies @xcite in the lattice - field - theory context .",
    "their consideration could be viewed as an interesting application of the monte carlo renormalization group @xcite to exploit the virtue of the fixed point .",
    "( the monte carlo renormalization group provides an explicit realization of the renormalization - group idea in the real space . )",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop an alternative approach to the elimination of corrections via the transfer - matrix method , and make the best use of its merits and characteristics .",
    "in fact , the four - spin interaction , appearing in our hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , is readily tractable with the transfer - matrix method , whereas it can make a conflict with the monte carlo simulation ; in fact , the four - spin interaction disables the use of cluster update .",
    "( probably , as for the monte carlo simulation , it might be more rewarding to enlarge the system size rather than incorporate extra interactions . )",
    "second , the extended interactions appearing in our hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are taken from the proposal by ma @xcite , who investigated the @xmath8 ising model and its renormalization - group flow .",
    "we consider that his renormalization - group scheme for @xmath8 is still of use to our @xmath0 case as well .",
    "actually , in our transfer - matrix treatment , the system size along the transfer - matrix direction is infinite , and the remaining @xmath8 fluctuations are responsible for the finite - size corrections . we demonstrate that ma s scheme leads to satisfactory elimination of finite - size corrections in @xmath0 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , we explain the real - space decimation ( renormalization group ) for the @xmath0 ising model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , and search for its fixed point . in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] , we perform extensive transfer - matrix simulation around this fixed point . here , we utilized an improved transfer - matrix method , which is explicated in appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "in this section , we search for a point of eliminated finite - size corrections of the extended ising model , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) . for that purpose",
    ", we set up a real - space renormalization group , and look for the scale - invariant ( fixed ) point ; the result is given by eq .",
    "( [ fixed_point ] ) .    to begin with , we set up the real - space renormalization group .",
    "we consider a couple of rectangular clusters with the sizes @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "these clusters are labeled by the symbols @xmath20 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "( because we utilize the transfer - matrix method , the system sizes perpendicular to these rectangles are both infinite . ) decimating out the spin variables indicated by the symbol @xmath21 of the @xmath7 cluster , we obtain a reduced lattice structure identical to that of the @xmath20 cluster .",
    "our concern is to find a `` scale invariance '' condition with respect to this real - space renormalization group .    before going into the explicit formulation of the renormalization group ( fixed - point analysis ) ,",
    "we explain briefly how we simulated the thermodynamics of these clusters .",
    "as mentioned above , we employ the transfer - matrix method .",
    "the transfer - matrix elements for the @xmath20 cluster are given by the formula , @xmath22 where the component @xmath23 denotes the local boltzmann weight for a plaquette , eq .",
    "( [ local_boltzmann_weight ] ) , and the spin variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) denote the spin configurations for both sides of the transfer - matrix slice .",
    "the component @xmath27 originates in the plaquette interactions perpendicular to the transfer - matrix direction , whereas the remaining part @xmath28 comes from the longitudinal ones .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 controls the boundary - interaction strength .",
    "note that irrespective of @xmath29 , the periodic - boundary condition is maintained ; namely , all @xmath30 spins remain equivalent as @xmath29 varies .",
    "such a redundancy is intrinsic to the @xmath31 system . here",
    ", we consider this redundant parameter as a freely tunable one .",
    "( for example , a naive implementation of the periodic - boundary condition for a pair of spins may result in such an interaction as @xmath32 .",
    "apparently , such a duplicated interaction is problematic .",
    "possibly , the interaction @xmath33 with a certain moderate parameter @xmath29 should be a favorable one .",
    "significant point is that the periodic boundary condition is maintained with @xmath29 varied . )",
    "we found that the choice @xmath34 is reasonable because of the reasons mentioned afterward .",
    "similarly to the above , we constructed the transfer matrix for the @xmath7 cluster as , @xmath35 with the @xmath19 spin configurations @xmath36 and @xmath37 under the periodic boundary condition . in this case ( @xmath38 ) , we have no ambiguity as to the boundary interaction .",
    "based on the above - mentioned simulation scheme , we calculate the location of the renormalization - group fixed point .",
    "we impose the following `` scale - invariance '' conditions , @xmath39 here , the symbol @xmath40 denotes the thermal average for the @xmath20 ( @xmath7 ) cluster , and the arrangement of spin variables @xmath24 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "we solve the solution of the above equations numerically , and found that a non - trivial solution does exist at , @xmath41 the last digits may be uncertain due to the numerical round - off errors .",
    "the result is to be compared with that of the preceding monte carlo study @xmath42 @xcite , where the authors incorporated the third - neighbor interaction @xmath43 and omitted @xmath44 instead .",
    "let us mention a few comments .",
    "first , in the next section , we confirm that the fixed point is indeed a good approximant to the phase - transition point .",
    "this fact indicates that the above renormalization - group analysis is sensible .",
    "moreover , we calculated the fixed point @xmath45 for the conventional ising model @xmath46 .",
    "we again see that this transition point is in agreement with a critical point @xmath47 determined with the monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "( hence , the choice of the boundary - interaction strength @xmath34 is justified . )",
    "second , we stress that the above renormalization group is not intended to obtain ( quantitatively reliable ) critical point nor the critical indices . _",
    "the aim of the above analysis is to truncate out the irrelevant interactions . _",
    "the detailed analysis on criticality is made with the subsequent finite - size - scaling analysis .",
    "in other words , our numerical approach consists of two steps , and the remaining step is considered in the next section .",
    "in the preceding sec . [ section2 ] , we determined the position of the renormalization - group fixed point , eq .",
    "( [ fixed_point ] ) . in this section , around the fixed point , we survey the criticality of the _ temperature - driven _ phase transition .",
    "namely , hereafter , we dwell on the one - parameter subspace , @xmath50 which contains the renormalization - group fixed point at @xmath51 .",
    "we anticipate that corrections to scaling ( influence of irrelevant operators ) should be suppressed in this parameter space .    throughout this section",
    ", we employ an improved version of the transfer - matrix method ( novotny s method ) @xcite .",
    "( to avoid confusion , we stress that in the above section , we used the conventional transfer - matrix method . )",
    "a benefit of novotny s method is that we are able to treat arbitrary ( integral ) number of spins , @xmath16 , constituting a unit of the transfer - matrix slice ; note that conventionally , the number of spins is restricted to @xmath17 .",
    "we explicate this simulation algorithm in appendix [ appendix ] .      in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , we plotted the scaled correlation length @xmath52 for @xmath53 and a variety of system sizes @xmath16 .",

    "[ figure8 ] .    from fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , we see a clear indication of criticality at @xmath59 ; note that the intersection point of the curves indicates a critical point . afterward , we compare this result to that of the conventional ising model @xmath46 to elucidate an improvement of the scaling behavior . here",
    ", we want to draw reader s attention to the point that we treated various system sizes @xmath16 with the aid of the novotny method . actually , in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , we notice that a variety of system sizes are available .",
    "apparently , such an extension of available system sizes is significant in the subsequent detailed finite - size - scaling analyses .    in fig .",

    "we see that the data collapse into a scaling function satisfactorily ; actually , we can hardly observe corrections to the finite - size scaling .    in the above",

    "( in the next section , we make a consideration on the abscissa scale . )",
    "thereby , we arrive at @xmath77 , which is consistent with the above result .",
    "( the error margin may come from purely statistical one . )",
    "we confirm that the choice of the abscissa scale is not so influential .",
    "we notice that the transition point @xmath66 ( [ transition_point ] ) and the renormalization - group fixed point @xmath78 ( [ fixed_point ] ) are in good agreement with each other .",
    "this fact confirms that the renormalization - group analysis in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] is indeed sensible . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , we do not require fine accuracy as to the convergence of @xmath66 and @xmath78 .",
    "the aim of the renormalization - group analysis is to search for a regime of eliminated corrections rather than to obtain the precise location of the fixed point .",

    "we argue the underlying physics of the abscissa scale ( extrapolation scheme ) in detail . in principle , the exponent @xmath92 governs the dominant ( systematic ) finite - size corrections . on the other hand , in the present simulation , we are trying to truncate out such systematic corrections .",

    "we consider that the systematic corrections should obey the scaling law like @xmath93 with a certain effective exponent @xmath94 , at least , in the regime of @xmath95 .",

    ", we notice that their @xmath48 indicates a non - negligible deviation , whereas the value of @xmath49 is in good agreement with ours .",
    "this fact confirms the above observation that @xmath98 exhibits appreciable systematic corrections , and the extrapolated value may contain a biased error .",
    "possibly , the adequate exponent @xmath99 would be even larger than the value @xmath100 utilized in fig . [ figure6 ] .",
    "nevertheless , for the sake of simplicity , we do not pursue this issue further , and supply the least - squares - fit result as it is .",
    "lastly , we mention a recent extensive exact - diagonalization result by hamer @xcite , who obtained @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "he investigated the quantum @xmath8 transverse - field ising model , relying on the belief that the quantum @xmath8 ising model should belong to the same universality class as the @xmath0 ising ferromagnet .",
    "the quantum version has an advantage such that the hamiltonian elements are sparse ( few non - zero elements ) , and one is able to treat a large cluster size @xmath103 . comparing our data with his results , we notice that they are almost comparable with each other . actually , the error margin of our @xmath49 is even smaller than his result , although we treated the @xmath0 ferromagnet directly .",
    "so far , it has been considered that the transfer - matrix method would not be very useful to the problems in @xmath4 because of its severe limitation as to the tractable system sizes . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrated that the corrections - to - scaling behavior of the @xmath0 ising model ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is improved by adjusting the coupling constants to the values of the renormalization - group fixed point , eq .",

    "[ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] are eliminated significantly as compared to those in fig .",

    "apparently , such an extension of available system sizes provides valuable information on criticality .",
    "owing to these improvements , we analyzed the criticality of the @xmath0 ising model with the transfer - matrix method , and obtained the critical indices @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , an attempt to eliminate finite - size corrections has been pursued @xcite in the context of the monte carlo renormalization group @xcite .",
    "we consider that an approach with the transfer - matrix method is also of use because of the following reasons .",
    "first , we accepted a simple renormalization - group scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , this scheme was introduced originally as for the @xmath8 ising model @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the transfer - matrix method is that the system size along the transfer - matrix direction is infinite , and the remaining @xmath8 fluctuations are responsible for the finite - size corrections .",
    "hence , such a ( @xmath8)-like renormalization group is still of use to achieve elimination of corrections satisfactorily .",
    "second , the transfer - matrix method is capable of the four - spin interaction appearing in our hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . on the other hand , the monte carlo sampling conflicts with such a multi - spin interaction , because the multi - spin interaction disables the use of cluster - update algorithm .",
    "( probably , an effort toward enlarging the system size would be rewarding from a technical viewpoint . )    in addition to these merits , we would like to emphasize again the point that the transfer - matrix approach with the novotny method allows us to treat a variety of system sizes @xmath16 .",
    "we consider that novotny s method combined with the elimination of finite - size corrections would be promising to resolve the ( seemingly intrinsic ) drawback of the transfer - matrix method in @xmath4 . as a matter of fact , the basic idea of the present scheme would be generic , and it might have a potential applicability to a wide class of systems .",
