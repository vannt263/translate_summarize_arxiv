    "considering the fact that the majority of ( spiral ) galaxies is not completely isolated but located in an environment which enables repeated close encounters or even merging processes with small companions it seems to be meaningful to systematically investigate the properties of galaxies affected by such processes .",
    "the investigation of their structural and dynamical changes caused by tidal interactions or low - mass satellite infall  hence `` minor merger ''  can help to clarify how far the evolution of disk galaxies was modified or even dominated by environmental effects .",
    "several n - body simulations were performed during the last decade in order to study the influence of minor mergers on galactic disks in greater detail ( e.g. quinn et al .",
    "@xcite ; mihos et al .",
    "@xcite ; walker et al .",
    "it was possible to use more realistic , multiple - component models for the galaxy - satellite system  usually consisting of disk , bulge , and halo  as well as a large number of particles ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "one of the main conclusions was that even merging processes in the range between @xmath2 can cause a vertical thickening of the stellar disk component by a factor between 2 and 4 , depending on the galactocentric distance .",
    "it was found that this vertical heating is due to a gain of kinetic energy of the disk stars by enhanced two - body relaxation . according to a series of papers on the frequency of these so called `` soft merging '' events ( e.g. toth & ostriker @xcite ; zaritsky @xcite , @xcite ) a large number of present - day ( disk- ) galaxies were affected by merging- or accretion processes of this magnitude since they have formed . as a consequence , interactions and minor mergers within this mass range",
    "might modify our picture of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "however , the enormous parameter space of such a complex scenario makes it difficult to derive general conclusions from a set of few specific simulations .",
    "the quantitative results still crucially depend on the chosen parameters such as the content and behaviour of gas in the disk , the mass ratio between bulge and disk , induced star formation , or the satellite orbit ( quinn et al .",
    "@xcite ; mihos et al .",
    "@xcite ; velazquez & white @xcite ) .",
    "statistical studies of galaxy interactions  based on optical photometry of disk galaxies ( reshetnikov & combes @xcite , @xcite )  focused on the effects of tidally - triggered disk thickening between systems of comparable mass .",
    "they found that the ratio @xmath3 of the radial exponential scale length @xmath4 to the constant scale height @xmath5 is only about twice smaller for interacting galaxies  a lower value than derived from the minor mergers simulations .",
    "however , the small number of objects in their sample ( 7 non - interacting and 24 interacting galaxies ) did not permit to study these questions in detail .",
    "therefore , we started a project based on a larger sample of edge - on disk galaxies in both optical and near infrared passbands .",
    "this combination offers a number of advantages :    first , observations in the near infrared particularly benefit from the much lower dust extinction near the galactic plane , i.e. at small @xmath6 .",
    "second , the presence of a dust lane along the major axis of most edge - on disk galaxies still presents one of the best methods to determine precise inclinations of the disks  two facts that will become very important in order to derive reliable scale parameters from a disk fitting procedure .",
    "third , this combination enables us to make conclusions on disk populations of different ages .",
    "the main questions of this study can be summarized as follows :    * are interactions / minor mergers able to change the radial and vertical structure of affected galactic disks ? * is there a substantial vertical disk thickening ?",
    "* of which order are the differences and similarities in the disk parameter distribution for a sample of interacting / non - interacting galaxies , respectively ? * to what extent are the disk properties of galaxies in the local universe influenced by interactions / minor mergers ?",
    "due to the complexity of these questions the paper is split into three parts : in this first part ( paper  i ) we present deep optical and near infrared photometric data of a total sample of 110 highly - inclined / edge - on disk galaxies .",
    "this sample consists of two subsamples of 61 non - interacting galaxies ( control sample ) and of 49 minor merging candidates .",
    "additionally , 41 of these galaxies were observed in the near infrared . in sect .",
    "2 the criteria of the sample selection will be described briefly .",
    "3 gives an overview on the observations and data reduction .",
    "the disk modelling- and fitting procedure applied to derive the disk parameters will be reviewed in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .  5",
    "we summarize and conclude the paper .",
    "in the second part ( schwarzkopf & dettmar @xcite , paper  ii ) the results of a detailed analysis of the structure of galactic disks will be presented .",
    "the third part ( schwarzkopf & dettmar in preparation , paper  iii ) will be focused on the influence of accompanying minor merger features  like disk `` warping '' and `` flaring ''  on the vertical disk structure .",

    "the selection of two separate subsamples of highly - inclined disk galaxies  consisting of a large number of interacting / merging candidates in the mass range @xmath7 , and of relatively isolated disk galaxies  is a crucial point for the comparison of disk parameters . since presumably",
    "not all of the merging processes of this order of magnitude  compared to large merging events  are able to change the structure of affected galaxy disks completely , two facts must be considered in order to classify both subsamples :    first , only merging events in a more progressed phase will have any appreciable effect on the disk structure .",
    "we therefore did not consider candidates in an early stage of interaction .",
    "instead , the sample contains some highly - inclined disk galaxies that show no separate satellite merging with the disk component , but strong evidence for accretion in the recent past ( indicated by both a disturbed disk structure and characteristic effects such as warping and tidal tails ) .",
    "most of these objects are located in galaxy groups with a few members , e.g. ngc 3628 , ngc 4634 , or ngc 4762 . due to their perturbed structure",
    "a morphological classification is difficult .",
    "second , a control sample of non - interacting edge - on disk galaxies must include all morphological types in the range @xmath0 ( table  [ types ] ) .",
    "the galaxies should be isolated without indication of interaction and accretion .",
    "in particular , it is important to include the latest type spirals like sd  so called `` superthin '' galaxies  since they belong to a class of disk galaxies having the smallest known axis ratios ( between 1:9 and 1:20 ) .",
    "these galaxies are characterized by velocity curves of modest gradient ( goad & roberts @xcite ; griv & peter @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , indicating that the `` superthins '' represent kinematically almost unheated galaxy disks .    beyond these `` limitations '' and the specific criteria described in the next section .",
    "it seems difficult to give a generalized definition of the selection criteria . as a consequence ,",
    "it is unavoidable that the sample of non - interacting galaxies is slightly `` polluted '' by some galaxies that were affected by interactions / minor mergers during their past but show no indication of these effects today . this effect would , however , only influence the non - interacting galaxies and lead to an underestimation of the actual differences between both samples .      in this study ,",
    "the notation `` interacting / merging '' refers closely to the classification scheme introduced by arp & madore ( @xcite ) and will therefore be used as a synonym for all galaxies which fulfil the following criteria : + galaxies with interacting companions , interacting doubles , galaxies with peculiar disks , galaxies with tails , loops of material or debris , irregular or disturbed galaxies , chains and groups of galaxies .",
    "a more detailed description of these classifications is given in arp & madore ( @xcite ) .",
    "with these limitations in mind , we selected interacting / merging candidates with an inclination @xmath8 ( derived from a first visual inspection ) . during this pre - selection",
    "we did not impose any morphological restrictions except that their type should be not much earlier than @xmath9 .",
    "the candidates were chosen from optical prints in `` a catalogue of southern peculiar galaxies and associations '' ( arp & madore @xcite ) , `` atlas of peculiar galaxies '' ( arp @xcite ) , and the nasa `` atlas of galaxies '' ( sandage & bedke @xcite ) .",
    "we also selected some systems from the catalogue `` satellites of spiral galaxies '' ( zaritsky et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another selection criterion for the minor mergers and those galaxies in the subsample with very close companions was the mass ratio between the main bodies .",
    "for all the candidates which could be separated into two individuals ( i.e. for @xmath10 galaxies of the interacting / merging sample ) this ratio was checked by an estimation of their total fluxes within a certain aperture or ellipse that contains all intensities down to the sky brightness .",
    "the resulting mean ratio is @xmath11 .",
    "typical examples ( with errors of @xmath12 ) are ngc 1531/32 ( @xmath13 ) , ngc 128 ( @xmath14 ) or ngc 1888 ( @xmath15 ) . for interacting galaxies located a less dense group or for those with a remote companion",
    "this mass ratio can be larger .",
    "the selection criteria for disk inclination and morphological types were the same as described for the interacting / merging galaxies .",
    "our principal sources for the subsample of highly - inclined , non - interacting galaxies were the eso - uppsala catalogue ( lauberts & valentijn @xcite ) , the rc3- ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "@xcite ) and ugc ( nilson @xcite ) catalogues , the `` carnegie atlas of galaxies '' ( sandage & bedke @xcite ) , and `` the hubble atlas of galaxies '' ( sandage @xcite ) . to check their isolation , larger fields @xmath16 , depending on the distance of individual objects ) were inspected visually using the digitized sky survey .    in order to benefit from a better spatial resolution of some closer objects",
    "there was only a lower limit in apparent angular disk diameter of @xmath17 for both galaxy samples .",
    "finally , the sample of non - interacting galaxies was filled up by 11 edge - on galaxies of the barteldrees & dettmar ( @xcite ) data set .",
    "several studies of the properties of edge - on galaxies argued that some of the disk parameters of spiral galaxies , e.g. the ratio of disk scale length to scale height , might be correlated with the morphological type ( de grijs & van der kruit @xcite ; de grijs @xcite ; schwarzkopf & dettmar @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it was also important to ensure that both subsamples investigated in this study are not affected by selection effects .",
    "this applies , in particular , to the distribution of morphologigal types and to the redshifts / distances of selected objects . due to their relation to the absolute properties of galactic disks",
    "the latter will be discussed in detail in paper  ii .",
    "the distribution of morphological types ( according to ned ) is shown in fig .",
    "1a for the complete galaxy sample , and in fig .",
    "1b for both subsamples of non - interacting and interacting / merging galaxies , respectively . the statistical test of kolmogorov & smirnov ( darling @xcite ; sachs @xcite )  hereafter ks  quantifies the similarity of both subsamples with a result of 0.04 .",
    "that is significantly lower than the value necessary for the 20%-limit ( 0.2 ) , which is the strongest of the ks - criteria .",
    "considering also the unavoidable errors ( @xmath18 ) introduced by an automated type classification ( corwin et al .",
    "@xcite ; lauberts & valentijn @xcite ) both distributions are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "the gross of galaxies covers the range between @xmath19 , with a strong peak at @xmath20 .",
    "this peak can also be observed in the frequency distribution of galaxy types in the available catalogues .",
    "the effect is caused by the selection criteria of the classification programs used in the catalogues ( sect .",
    "6 in lauberts & valentijn ( 1989 ) ) .",
    "due to the large number of galaxies needed for reliable statistics the optical observations were obtained with different telescopes and during several observing runs between february 1996 and june 1998 .",
    "the following telescopes were used :    1.54 m danish and 61 cm bochum telescope on la silla , chile ; 42-inch telescope at lowell observatory , flagstaff ; 1.23 m telescope at calar alto observatory , spain ; 1.06 m telescope at hoher list observatory , germany .",
    "the used passbands were johnson @xmath21 and thuan & gunn @xmath22 , with a central wavelength at @xmath23 nm and 670 nm , bandpass @xmath24 nm and 103 nm , respectively .",
    "all observing runs and the used telescope / detector characteristics are listed in table  [ telescopes ] .",
    "the seeing conditions are given as averaged fwhm values .",
    "details of the optical observations are listed in table  [ samples ] .",
    "additionally for most of the sample galaxies the total blue surface brightness , @xmath25 , and the morphological type @xmath26 ( revised hubble type , according to lauberts & valentijn ( @xcite ) , table  [ types ] ) are given .",
    "the near infrared observations were obtained with the magic camera of the mpia attached to the 2.2 m and 1.23 m telescopes of the calar alto observatory , spain , and with the irac2b camera on the eso / mpia 2.2 m telescope of the european southern observatory ( eso ) , chile , respectively .",
    "both the magic and irac2b cameras are equipped with a rockwell @xmath27 @xmath28 nicmos3 hgcdte array .",
    "the data were acquired during several observing runs between february 1996 and june 1998 .    for all runs we used the @xmath29 filter ( central wavelength @xmath30 , bandpass @xmath31 ) , or the @xmath32 filter ( @xmath33 ) . for some objects images in the @xmath34 filter",
    "were obtained ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "we recorded object and sky frames alternately , with typical single integration times of @xmath36s per sequence , and spatially separated by @xmath37 . to eliminate bad pixels ,",
    "the telescope `` on source''-positions were dithered by a few arcseconds between subsequent exposures . since many of the sample galaxies are faint objects it was required to reach at least @xmath38 min integration time `` on source '' , which corresponds to @xmath39 cycle repetitions and a resulting observing time of @xmath40 hours .",
    "therefore , only one third of our total optical galaxy sample was observed in the near infrared .    since our study is aiming at an investigation of the structure and geometrical properties of galactic disks , we could make use of observations obtained under non - photometric conditions .",
    "for that reason the optical and near infrared contour maps of the sample galaxies shown in figs .  3 and 4 are not flux calibrated .    as for the optical observations ,",

    "precise rotation was more difficult .",

    "therefore , integration of ( 1 ) must be calculated numerically .",
    "hence , the intensity @xmath65 of one point ( pixel ) of the disk  as it can be seen by an observer at the projected coordinates @xmath66 and @xmath67 on the ccd  can be written in cartesian coordinates in the following form ( for example , only the double exponential disk model ( 2 ) is given here in its explicit form , for @xmath68 ; integration of models ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) is analogous ) :    @xmath69    the integration limits are , in a direction of the line - of - sight , given by the geometry of the `` galaxy - cylinder '' :    @xmath70    and can be approximated for @xmath71 by    @xmath72    i.e. by a cylinder with a height of about 10 scale heights . at larger distances above the disk plane",

    "although the disk inclination is varied between @xmath79 , for each of the vertical profiles a quantitative good fit can be found by changing only the scale height @xmath5 and the central luminosity density @xmath46 ( as indicated ; further explanation see text ) .      in order to derive relible disk parameters we developed two independent disk fitting procedures that were designed to comply the special tasks proposed for the first ( paper  i+ii ) and second ( paper  iii ) part of this study",
    "( see sect .  1 ) .",
    "the first fitting procedure was realized semi - automatically .",
    "it uses different graphs enabling a direct comparison by eye of a set of radial and vertical profiles within a preselected disk area with those of an underlying disk model . to take advantage of symmetrical light distribution of galactic disks",
    "the profiles used for modelling are averaged over two quadrants .",
    "they are usually displayed equidistantly and cover the whole fitting area .",
    "the size of the fitting area vastly depends on the properties of the individual image , i.e. on both the image quality and some special features of the galaxy disk itself . therefore the program allows  after a first inspection of the profiles  an interactive selection of a qualified fitting area .",
    "depending on the s / n ratio and the spatial resolution of the images it is also possible to use a desired pixel binning for both image and model ( as an example fig .",
    "2 shows one of the sets of radial and vertical disk profiles ) .",
    "this kind of modelling allows fast and flexible , but reliable disk fitting of a large number of galaxies  in particular of interacting / merging galaxies  whose disk profiles do often show considerable deviations from the simple model .",
    "such galaxies are therefore difficult to handle with conventional least squares fitting methods .",
    "the second fitting procedure uses the same set of disk models as described before but a least square fitting in order to fit the scale height as a function of the galactocentric distance .",
    "the properties of the program will be described in detail in paper  iii . to ensure homogenity of the fitting results the fit quality reached with this method",
    "was compared with that of the above described semi - automated disk modelling ( for this purpose the data of non - disturbed disk profiles of galaxies in the non - interacting sample were used ) .",
    "it was found that both methods give consistent results with errors on ( or below ) a 10%-level .",
    "the errors found for the fits of the scale height only are even smaller than 5% .",
    "the remaining discrepancies are not due to the individual method itself but rather to the following two reasons : first , the fitting areas are slightly different ( i.e. they are usually more restricted for the least square method as a result of its sensibility against the error sources described in the following ) .",
    "second , the scale height of a large fraction of galaxy disks investigated shows variations of different absolute size ( both irregularly and systematically , i.e. gradients ) along the galactocentric distance .",
    "therefore this point will be discussed in detail in paper  iii .",
    "a detailed comparison of the semi - automated disk modelling with another , independent developed least square fitting routine will be given in pohlen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "after comparison of both fitting methods we choose to use the semi - automated disk modelling for this part of the study because it combines the advantages of fast and flexible fitting with a high accuracy . in view of the existing data the point of flexible",
    "fitting is very important since  despite all structural similarities  the radial and vertical profiles of induvidual ( disk ) galaxies are unique .",
    "the profiles investigated here are often heavily contaminated by light from , e.g. , a bulge and/or a bar , a nearby companion , other disk components , foreground stars or reflections from bright stars .",
    "in addition , the modelling may be complicated by strong dust extinction along the galactic plane , by a low s / n ratio , or a considerably warped disk ( mainly interacting / merging galaxies ) . since most of the foregoing deviations can not be easily quantified their complete consideration by an automated fitting procedure thus seems almost impossible and would cause unpredictably errors .    in the following step - by - step procedure",
    "the disk parameters of the semi - automated disk fitting procedure are reduced systematically : as a first step , the inclination is determined by using the axis ratio of the dust lane in the disk plane of optical images .",
    "given a relatively sharp dust lane , an accuracy of less than @xmath80 can be reached . the central luminosity density , @xmath81 ,",
    "is calculated automatically by the fitting program for each new parameter set by using a number of preselected reference points along the disk ( outside the bulge- or bar - light contaminated regions ) .    given a sufficient s / n ratio , the cut - off radius @xmath49 can be fitted to the major axes profiles with an accuracy between @xmath82 .",
    "the cut - off is determined by a significant decrease of the intensity extrapolated to @xmath83 ( left panels in fig .  2 ) .",
    "for highly - inclined disks such as the ones studied here , the effect of a variation of @xmath49 on the slope of radial disk profiles is negligible .",
    "thus , the remaining `` real '' fitting parameters are the disk scale length and height , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as well as the set of 3 functions @xmath84 . within the following procedure both the scale length and the scale height",
    "are fitted in an iterative process until a first good convergence of the `` global '' fit is achieved . during this process ,",
    "the quality of the corresponding fits can be checked simultaneously using a small set of radial and vertical disk profiles ( usually 3 profiles each , see fig .  2 as an example ) .",
    "for further small corrections , if necessary , both parameters can be considered as independent and thus separated without any loss of accuracy .",
    "for this `` fine tuning '' a set with more disk profiles ( usually 6 - 8 ) is used for both parameters .    during the iterative process of modelling the scale length",
    "is fitted to a set of averaged major axes profiles in a radial region typically between @xmath85 and vertically outside strong dust extinction ( left panels in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the fit quality of the vertical profiles along the disk can be used as a cross - check for the scale length ( right panels in fig .  2 ) .",
    "as a result of the error sources mentioned at the beginning the disk scale length of a galaxy can be reproduced ( with the same method ) with an accuracy of @xmath82 .",
    "in contrast to this , the scale lengths derived with different methods can in some cases differ by @xmath86 .",
    "the disk scale height @xmath5 is estimated by fitting the @xmath6-profiles inside the previously selected radial regions , which are outside the bulge- or bar contamination ( right panels in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the vertical region used for the fits is typically between @xmath87 , but depends strongly on the individual characteristic of the dust lane .",
    "if the disk inclination is known precisely , this fitting method works reliably .",
    "otherwise , additional errors may be introduced ( see next sect . ) .",
    "the vertical disk profiles of most of the galaxies investigated in optical passbands enable a reliable choice of the quantitatively best fitting function @xmath84 .",
    "this is because deviations between different models become visible at vertical distances larger than that of the most sharply - peaked dust regions .",
    "for those disks that are affected by strong dust extinction , the choice was made easier by using a combination of both optical and near infrared profiles .",
    "for these cases profiles of both passbands were , if available , used for fitting .",
    "if a large sample of disk galaxies is investigated statistically  as is the case in this study  moderate deviations from edge - on orientation of the order of @xmath88 are common ( sect .  2 ) .",
    "it was found in this study and in schwarzkopf & dettmar ( @xcite ) that , if reliable values for the scale height are desired , deviations from @xmath89 larger than @xmath90 can not be neglegted .",
    "therefore in this section the influence of small changes of inclination on vertical disk profiles and on the resulting parameters will be investigated in detail .    for that purpose we selected 3 @xmath22-band images of galaxies in the non - interacting sample with well known disk parameters , but with different vertical profiles : @xmath77 exp ( ic 2531 ) ; @xmath77 sech ( ngc 1886 ) ; and @xmath78 ( eso 187-g08 ) . at 3 different inclinations ( @xmath91 ; @xmath92 ; and @xmath93 ) the vertical profiles of each model were best - fitted to the observed disk profiles ( see left , middle , and right panels of fig .  3 ) . to compensate for the effect of inclination , both the disk scale height , @xmath5 , and the central luminosity density , @xmath46 , must be changed . as can be seen in the disk parameters ( middle raw in fig .  3 and table  [ inclination ] ) the effect for @xmath5 is , at @xmath94 , around the @xmath95-level for all vertical models , whereas for @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "3 bottom ) the error amounts to @xmath97 for the exp - model and , after all , to @xmath98 for the @xmath99 and sech - models . at smaller inclinations the quality of all vertical fits decreases rapidly and allows no more qualitative good fits . as expected , the effect of slight changes of inclination on both the scale height and the shape of vertical profiles near the disk plane is the strongest for the exp - model ( left panels in fig .  3 ) .",
    "the effect shown above is due to the fact that the slope of the vertical disk profiles  in a region that is relevant for fitting ( previous section )  remains nearly unchanged in the range between @xmath100 , whereas this is not true for the width of the vertical profiles .",
    "hence , to obtain reliable disk parameters for @xmath5 and @xmath46 it is required that both    * the inclination of the disk is known precisely ( within @xmath101 ) and * a disk model with a flexible inclination is used .",
    "otherwise , substantial errors for @xmath5 and @xmath46 are introduced ( table  [ inclination ] lists averaged errors @xmath102 and @xmath103 , obtained by fitting 5 galaxies with 3 different vertical disk models each ) .",
    "1.2 mm    ccrrccrrccrr & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & & & + & & & & & & & & & & & + @xmath92 & & @xmath104 & @xmath105 & & & @xmath105 & @xmath105 & & & @xmath105 & @xmath106 + @xmath93 & & @xmath107 & @xmath108 & & & @xmath109 & @xmath109 & & & @xmath110 & @xmath111 +",
    "optical and near infrared photometric data of a sample of 110 highly - inclined / edge - on disk galaxies are presented .",
    "this sample consists of two subsamples of 61 non - interacting galaxies and 49 minor merging candidates .",
    "additionally , 41 of these galaxies were observed in the near infrared .    the sample selection , observations , and data reduction are described .",
    "we show that  although the subsamples are naturally slightly polluted due to unavoidable selection effects  the distribution of their morphological types is almost indistinguishable , covering the range between @xmath0 .",
    "this is important for the forthcoming detailed statistical study focused on the influence of interaction and minor merger on the radial and vertical disk structure of spiral galaxies .",
    "moreover , a 3-dimensional disk modelling- and fitting procedure is described in order to analyze and to compare the disk structure of our sample galaxies by using characteristical parameters .",
    "we find that the vertical brightness profiles of modelled galaxy disks respond very sensitive even to small changes of inclination around perfect edge - on orientation .",
    "therefore , projection effects of highly - inclined disks must be considered .",

    "<S> additionally , 41 of these galaxies were observed in the near infrared . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the distribution of morphological types of both subsamples is almost indistinguishable , covering the range between @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> an improved , 3-dimensional disk modelling- and fitting procedure is described in order to analyze and to compare the disk structure of our sample galaxies by using characteristic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the vertical brightness profiles of galactic disks respond very sensitive even to small deviations from the perfect edge - on orientation . </S>",
