    "currently , experiments on spin 1/2-baryon semileptonic decays ( bsd ) , @xmath5 , where the polarization @xmath6 of the emitted baryon @xmath7 is observed are underway @xcite .",

    "the model independence of rc is achieved by following the generalization for hyperons @xcite of the treatment of virtual rc in neutron beta decay @xcite and of the application of the low theorem @xcite to the bremsstrahlung rc developed in ref .",
    "there are six different charge assignments predicted by the light and heavy quark content of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "to cover all these cases it is necessary to know only the rc to the neutral decaying baryon ( ndb ) @xmath13 and to the charged decaying baryon ( cdb ) @xmath14 cases .",

    "the cases @xmath15 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are included in the rc by keeping the mass @xmath16 of @xmath9 uncompromised all along the calculation . in order to produce numerical values of rc that are practical to use in the monte carlo simulation of an experimental analysis and",
    "that are not committed to fixed values of the form factors of the weak vertex , one can numerically calculate the rc to the coefficients of the quadratic products of form factors that appear in the theoretical differential decay rate of the decay being measured .",
    "since current experiments are medium - statistics ( of the order of thousands of events ) experiments and in order to keep the effort of calculating rc within convenient bounds , we shall consider contributions of order @xmath3 , with @xmath17 only and neglect orders with @xmath18 and higher . here",
