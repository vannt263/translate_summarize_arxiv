    "it seems to be generally taken for granted that a compound of an even number of fermions behaves like a boson since any state of @xmath1 fermions has the same permutational symmetry as a state of @xmath2 bosons .",
    "accordingly , the recent experiments with trapped ultracold gases @xcite @xcite @xcite are viewed as an achievement of bose - einstein condensation @xcite .",
    "however , a moment s thinking reveals that this can not be true in an exact sense but at most approximately .",
    "consider an ideal gas of @xmath2  bosons \" , each  boson \" consisting of @xmath3 fermions bound together by some attractive force . in the high temperature limit the bounds between the fermions will be broken and the system behaves like an ideal fermi gas at high temperatures . its energy will thus be @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is number of degrees of freedom for a single fermion , e.  g.  @xmath6 for fermions sitting in a @xmath7-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential which we assume now for sake of simplicity",
    ". this would be consistent with the corresponding formula for a bose gas of @xmath2 particles if the number of degrees of freedom for a single boson is assumed to be @xmath8 .",
    "for intermediate temperatures @xmath9 which are large with respect to the spacing of @xmath10-particle energies , say @xmath11 , but small with respect to the binding energy of the fermionic compounds , we would expect a  preliminary \" classical limit of the energy , say @xmath12 , different from @xmath13 .",
    "hence the energy function @xmath14 of the considered gas can not coincide with that of an ideal bose gas at medium and high temperature .",
    "+ more interesting with regard to bose - einstein condensation is the low temperature limit .",
    "@xmath2 non - interacting bosons would occupy the same @xmath10-particle ground state for @xmath15 , which is impossible for @xmath1 fermions according to the pauli principle .",
    "hence we expect a non - bose behaviour for  bosons \" also for low temperatures . in view of these problems",
    "we have scruples about identifying compounds of @xmath3 fermions with bosons and will rather call them  pseudo - bosons \" .",
    "+ to be sure , there will be a close resemblance between bosons and pseudo - bosons and the thermodynamic functions of ideal gases of each sort should be approximately the same for some range of temperature , not too low and not too high . to make this statement more precise",
    "is a challenge to the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics , in particular , to demonstrate the possibility of pseudo - bose - einstein condensation .",
    "we do not know of any attempt to tackle this problem , with the exception of an estimate of the critical density of a pseudo - bose - einstein condensate where fermionic effects would occur @xcite .",
    "+ as a first step to treating the problem of pseudo - bosons we seek for simple models describing the formation of pairs of fermions , being the simplest case of pseudo - bosons , which are solvable in the sense that the partition function of the system can be explicitely calculated . for this purpose",
    "the model need not be a realistic description of , say , rubidium atoms in a trap .",
    "it rather serves as an example to study the problem of pseudo - bosons in principle .",
    "+ in section [ s ] ( summary and outlook ) we will come back to the problem of pseudo - bosons .",
    "of course , the model we are going to present can be considered in its own sake without reference to the specific problem and could be compared with other @xmath10-dimensional solvable models of quantum systems , see @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the case of pairs of interacting bosons is completely analogous and can be treated simultaneously , although the discussion of the results will be confined to the fermi case .",
    "the model will be defined in section [ d ] and consists of two sorts of @xmath2 fermions ( resp .",
    "bosons ) with equally spaced non - degenerate @xmath10-particle energy levels . in this aspect",
    "it remotely resembles the luttinger model @xcite,@xcite , which is , however , unitarily and hence thermodynamically equivalent to a system of non - interacting particles . in our model",
    "the interaction is introduced in such a way that pairs of fermions of different sort with the same quantum number gain a binding energy @xmath16 .",
    "hence the diagonalization of the total hamiltonian is trivial .",
    "the calculation of the partition function in section [ z ] , however , requires some combinatorics .",
    "for @xmath17 we calculate the specific heat , using computer - algebraic means , and discuss its properties ( section [ c ] ) . for larger",
    "@xmath2 one has to resort to the thermodynamic limit which is derived in section [ l ] . the convergence to this limit is shown to be rather rapid for @xmath18 .",
    "we will consider two sorts of particles with hilbert spaces @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath10-particle states .",
    "let @xmath21 and @xmath22 be orthonormal bases in @xmath19 and @xmath20 . define the @xmath10-particle hamiltonians by @xmath23 which holds for example if all particles are assumed to sit in a @xmath10-dimensional harmonic oscillator ( ho ) potential and the zero point energy is neglected .",
    "usually we will set @xmath24 in what follows , but later we consider a scaling law @xmath25 in the context of the thermodynamic limit @xmath26 .",
    "the interaction between particles of different sorts will have the simple form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a real parameter .",
    "thus the systems gains the binding energy @xmath16 if two particles of different sorts have the same quantum numbers and form a compound , say , a  molecule \" .",
    "the molecules can be viewed as pseudo - particles in a ho potential with double spacing @xmath29 of the energy values .",
    "we consider @xmath2 fermions ( resp .",
    "bosons ) of each sort , but particles of different sorts are still assumed to be distinguishable .",
    "the total hilbert space will thus be @xmath30 where the @xmath31sign stands for the completely symmetric ( @xmath32 ) , resp .",
    "antisymmetric ( @xmath33 ) subspace .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath34 where the subscripts @xmath35 indicate the factor of the tensor product where the @xmath10- and @xmath36-particle hamiltonians of the form ( [ d.1 ] ) and ( [ d.2 ] ) act upon .",
    "clearly , ( [ d.4 ] ) is invariant under permutations @xmath37 and will be understood to be restricted to the subspace @xmath38 .    in the fermionic case",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath39 can be chosen as the products of slater determinants @xmath40 where all quantum numbers of the same sort are strictly ordered , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we will write the latter condition in the compact form @xmath43 .",
    "analogously one obtains the eigenfunctions in the bosonic case , but here we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 or , equivalently , @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding energy eigenvalues are @xmath47",
    "the above defined model is admittedly a rather crude description of a real quantum gas , but it allows an explicit calculation of its partition function without any further approximation . as usual , the partition function is defined by @xmath48 in view of ( [ d.6 ] ) we will split the series ( [ z.1 ] ) into a finite number of subseries according to the number of coincidences between the two sequences of quantum numbers @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "more precisely , we will split the total index set @xmath51 or , equivalently , the set of eigenstates of @xmath39 into disjoint subsets according to their  order type \" .",
    "the order type of @xmath52 comprises the linear ordering of the union of both sequences @xmath49 and @xmath50 , including the coincidences of quantum numbers . for @xmath53 and",
    "the fermionic case we have @xmath54 different order types , for example @xmath55 or @xmath56 .    in general",
    ", every order type can be uniquely characterized by a string @xmath57 composed of symbols @xmath58 . ",
    "@xmath59 \" means  a quantum number of sort @xmath10 \" , analogously for  @xmath60 \" , but  @xmath61",
    "\" means that  two quantum numbers of different sort coincide \" . in the above example , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 denote the number of occurences of the symbol  @xmath65 \" in the string @xmath57 and @xmath66 the length of @xmath57 .",
    "we define @xmath67 as the set of all finite strings @xmath57 over the alphabeth @xmath68 such that @xmath69 .",
    "then the strings @xmath57 in @xmath67 are in @xmath70 correspondence with the order types , denoted by @xmath71 , of the subsequences of ( [ z.1 ] ) .",

    "note that the series @xmath76 is only a @xmath77-fold series because of the @xmath78 coincidences between the quantum numbers . in the exponent",
    ", however , each term in @xmath79 has to be counted once , irrespective of coincidences .",
    "hence we may introduce @xmath77 new summation indices @xmath80 if we account for the double occurences in the exponent by factors @xmath81",
    ". the condition @xmath82 will be written in the compact form @xmath83 , analogously @xmath84 .",
    "this yields @xmath85 where we have used @xmath86 and the definition @xmath87    the remaining evaluation of ( [ z.4 ] ) is straight forward .",
    "we introduce as new summation variables the differences @xmath88 and use the partial sums @xmath89 since @xmath90 further let @xmath91 then we obtain    @xmath92    the result can be further simplified by utilizing the fact that ( [ z.8b ] ) depends only on the @xmath93 , i.  e.  on the positions of the symbol  @xmath94 \" in the string @xmath57 .",

    "( for the identity @xmath116 in 1-dimensional ho potentials see @xcite . ) for @xmath117 the specific heat increases above its preliminary classical level which indicates a beginning dissociation of the molecules . for @xmath118",
    "the final classical limit @xmath119 of @xmath109 particles in a ho potential is reached and all molecules are dissociated . but before , at @xmath120 , a marked peak of the specific heat occurs which means that at this temperature the maximal portion of any energy supply would be used for the dissociation of the molecules instead of heating up the system .",
    "this peak at @xmath120 might indicate a diffuse phase transition , however , the question whether a real phase transition occurs can only be addressed by considering the thermodynamic limit @xmath26 in the next section and will be answered negatively there .",

    "it turns out that the explicit solution ( [ z.9 ] ) can also be evaluated in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "but we have to perform a simultaneous scaling of the energy level spacing @xmath124 .",
    "this is analogous to the usual practice of letting the volume of a system go to infinity in such a way that the particle density remains finite .    to find the correct scaling law in our case , we consider @xmath2 fermions occupying the first @xmath2 eigenstates of a ho potential ( the  fermi sea \" ) .",
    "their @xmath10-particle density assumes values which diverge as @xmath125 within an interval of length @xmath126 in accordance with the total integral of the @xmath10-particle density being @xmath2 .",
    "the typical unit of length of the ho is @xmath127 .",
    "hence a scaling @xmath128 stretches the system by a factor @xmath125 and reduces the @xmath10-particle density to finite values for @xmath26 . for a more detailed account",
    "see @xcite . in the case of a boson gas we can not argue in the same way as above , but we will choose the same scaling . in this case the existence of a thermodaynamic limit , which is shown below , is the only justification of choosing the scale transformation @xmath128 .    in practice",
    "the considered scaling means that the variable @xmath129 on the rhs of ( [ z.9 ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath130 , except for the factor @xmath131 which comes from the interaction , not from the ho potential .",
    "consequently , the corresponding terms can be approximated by their high temperature limit , i.  e.  by their first order taylor expansion with respect to @xmath132 . in this limit",
    "the difference between the statistics of fermions and bosons disappears .",
    "hence @xmath133 and we obtain @xmath134 in the next step we calculate the combinatorical factor : @xmath135 in order to prove ( [ l.4 ] ) we first consider an example .",
    "let @xmath136 and consider the string @xmath137 .",
    "we then have @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "hence @xmath140 .",
    "generalizing this example , we see that @xmath141 can always be written as a fraction with denominator @xmath142 and the nominator being a product of @xmath78 integers @xmath143 with @xmath144 such that their distance is @xmath145 for @xmath146 .",
    "conversely , any @xmath78 integers with these properties occur in the nominator of the terms in the sum @xmath147 .",
    "we set @xmath148 and generalize to arbitrary natural numbers @xmath149 .",
    "let @xmath150 be defined as the sum of all products of @xmath78-tuples @xmath151 with @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "if we enlarge @xmath149 by @xmath10 additionally those @xmath78-tuples satisfy the above condition with @xmath154 .",
    "hence the following recursion relation holds for @xmath155 : @xmath156 moreover , @xmath157 and @xmath158 the recursion relation ( [ l.5 ] ) and the initial conditions ( [ l.6 ] ) , ( [ l.7 ] ) are satisfied by the following solution @xmath159 as can be easily confirmed .",
    "setting @xmath160 and dividing by @xmath142 completes the proof of ( [ l.4 ] ) .    inserting ( [ l.4 ] ) into ( [ l.3b ] ) yields    @xmath161",
    "next we approximate the factorials in ( [ l.8a ] ) by stirling expressions , e.  g.  @xmath162 , set @xmath163 and replace the sum @xmath164 by an integral @xmath165 .",

    "thus we can evaluate the integral for @xmath169 using the saddle point method .    in the last step",
    "we remove all factors in the partition function approximation which are not of the form @xmath170 , @xmath171 being independent of @xmath2 .",
    "these factors would only give finite @xmath2 corrections in the thermodynamic functions and have to be neglected in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "as expected , the behavior of the specific heat function mentioned above deviates from that of an @xmath2-particle bose gas , see figure [ fig1 ] , similarly for the entropy function , see figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "however , for low temperatures the difference between bosons and pseudo - bosons is not so marked as we would expect in the general case .",
