    "recent detections of warm carbon bearing molecules in different o - rich agb stars suggest that these carbon species have to form in the deep layers of the stellar wind .",
    "photochemical models ( willacy & millar 1997 ) of several o - rich stars , which rely on injection of certain molecules to generate a carbon - rich chemistry at large radii , succeed in reproducing the observed values of certain molecules but fail to reproduce some molecular abundances , in particular that of hcn . hcn is observed in the envelope of several o- and s - type stars at abundances of @xmath4 ( bieging & latter  1994 ( bl94 ) ; bujarrabal et al .",

    "an investigation of non - equilibrium chemistry of the oxygen rich mira ik tau showed that these carbon bearing molecules can efficiently form in the inner regions close to the stellar photosphere ( dcw99 ) . in this case , it was shown that applications of stellar pulsation induced shocks in a narrow region of the photosphere can give rise to molecular processes in the immediate cooling layer and the hydrodynamic cooling part ( @xmath5  excursion ) of the post shock region and can produce certain carbon bearing molecules including hcn and co@xmath6 .",
    "it was earlier noted for s - type stars ( bujarrabal et al .",
    "1994 ) that their molecular line strengths are almost equidistant between those of c- and o- rich objects .",
    "this property has been argued to be related to the fact that the atmospheric c / o ratio is close to the value of 1 and intermediate to that of o- and c- rich evolved stars .",
    "we therefore apply dcw99 s chemical model , which successfully reproduces the observed hcn abundances in o - rich objects , to the intermediate case of s stars . in tandem",
    "we have looked for observational evidence that the hcn is forming in the inner envelope the s star @xmath2  cyg . although hcn has previously been detected in @xmath2  cyg , the lines observed are dominated by material at large radii , so here we look for high excitation transitions . in carbon stars ,",
