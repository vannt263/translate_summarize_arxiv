    "extensive studies of the stability of geometrically thin , optically thick , keplerian accretion disks in the newtonian regime ( lightman & eardley 1974 , henceforth le ; lightman 1974a , b , henceforth l74a , b ; shakura & sunyaev 1976 ; piran 1978 , henceforth p78 ) have established that such disks are unstable to both viscous and thermal modes when they are radiation pressure dominated ( rpd ) , but not when they are gas pressure dominated ( gpd ) . in this _ letter _ , we show that gpd disks are viscously unstable in an essentially relativistic region not far from the innermost stable orbit at @xmath0 , due to general relativistic ( gr ) modifications in the behaviors of the disk s viscous stress and surface density . for a slowly - rotating central accreting object ,",
    "this region spans a range of radii @xmath1 in units of the central object s mass @xmath2 ( we use the convention @xmath10 throughout this work ) .",
    "we demonstrate that , after including these gr modifications , rpd disks remain viscously unstable in this region , except in an extremely small annulus around @xmath3 , which has a negligible effect .",
    "inclusion of the stabilizing effect of the mass - inflow through the disk s inner edge via a gr analogue of roche - lobe overflow ( abramowicz 1981 , 1985 , henceforth a81 , a85 ) adds a further , small , stable annulus around  for rpd disks , but leaves gpd disks unchanged . the inner parts of gpd disks ( around black holes or sufficiently compact , weakly - magnetized neutron stars ) extending to radii @xmath11 are thus expected to have blobs of matter : we indicate the relevance of this result for high - frequency x - ray variability observed with the @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "viscous stability in thin , keplerian disks in gr is described by the evolution of the disk s surface density @xmath13 , which is obtained by combining the conditions of conservation of mass and angular momentum . in kerr metric , these are @xmath14 @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the local , instantaneous mass flux , @xmath17 is the vertically - integrated viscous stress , @xmath18 is the specific angular momentum , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are relativistic factors ( novikov & thorne 1973 , henceforth nt73 ) whose values reduce to unity in the newtonian regime : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the specific angular momentum of the central accreting object , and we express lengths and times in units of @xmath2 in all relativistic factors _ only_. equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) yield @xmath25\\,,\\eqno(4)\\ ] ] showing how the viscous stress @xmath17 determines the evolution of @xmath26 .",
    "the newtonian limits of equations ( 1)-(4 ) were used by le and l74b to argue that viscous instability sets in when viscous stress is a decreasing function of surface density , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath27 , while the disk is stable when @xmath28 ( also see pringle 1981 ) .",
    "this is transparent upon expressing the radial derivative of @xmath17 in equation ( 4 ) in terms of  ( l74b ) , and comparing with the standard form for diffusion equations : the effective diffusion coefficient is negative in the former case , indicating the formation of density clumps , while it is positive in the latter case , indicating normal viscous diffusion .",
    "the physical reason is equally transparent : in the former case , a local upward fluctuation in @xmath26 causes a decrease in the viscous stress , making the viscous smoothing of the density clump more difficult , and the situation runs away ( albeit on the slow , viscous timescale ) .",
    "the latter case is stable , as any tendency towards clumping is nullified by the stronger viscous smoothing it generates . since for `` standard '' newtonian keplerian accretion disks ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 , henceforth ss73 ) @xmath29 in rpd regions ( le ) and @xmath30 in gpd regions ( see  3.2 ) , le and l74b derived the well - known newtonian result that the former are viscously unstable , while the latter are stable .",
    "the crucial point about relativistic disks is that the basic criterion for viscous stability in terms of  remains the same as above , as an inspection of equation ( 4 ) readily shows .",
    "this is as expected , since the physical picture given above remains unaltered in the gr regime .",
    "therefore , the stability of a disk model in the gr regime is determined by the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath26 in that regime . in  3 , we summarize this relation for thin , keplerian disks in the gr regime , and its effects on viscous stability .",
    "in so doing , we use the gr formulation of geometrically thin , optically thick , keplerian accretion disks of nt73 throughout .",
    "the formulation of ss73 was basically newtonian , with an appropriate gr boundary condition applied _ ad hoc _ to the viscous stress at .",
    "while the consistent gr formulation of nt73 is more suitable for our purposes , we indicate later that the effects described here can be seen qualitatively even in the ss73 formulation , and in the pseudo - newtonian generalization ( abramowicz _ et  al . _  1988 ,",
    "henceforth acls ) thereof .",
    "the vertically - integrated viscous stress @xmath17 is obtained in the gr formulation ( nt73 ) by combining the conservation laws for angular momentum and energy , subject to the boundary condition that @xmath17 vanishes at @xmath0 , where the gas `` falls out '' of the disk and spirals down to the central object : @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is a relativistic factor ( nt73 ) which describes the effects of the boundary conditions on @xmath17 : at @xmath0 , @xmath32 vanishes , while in the newtonian regime , @xmath32 reduces to unity .",
    "@xmath32 has been calculated for the kerr metric in page & thorne ( 1974 ) .",
    "explicit computations given in this _",
    "letter _ will be confined to the schwarzschild metric presents no difficulties or surprises , and will be described elsewhere .",
    "] , in which limit @xmath17 is given by is missing ; in addition , the relativistic factor @xmath33 is missing as well in the ss73 formulation .",
    "however , @xmath17 still has the same qualitative shape . ]",
    "@xmath34\\,,\\eqno(6)\\ ] ] and shown in figure 1 . from the newtonian limit @xmath35 at large distances , @xmath17 passes through a maximum at @xmath3 , vanishing at @xmath36 .",
    "the disk s surface density @xmath26 is determined by its vertical structure , the physics of which is threefold : vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , vertical radiative transport of energy , and equation of state ( ss73 ; nt73 ) . in gr , the first is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the disk pressure and density , respectively , and the relativistic factor @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 note that this is the improved version of the original nt73 formulation as given by riffert & herold ( 1995 ) ; for more detailed gr formulation and discussion , see abramowicz , lanza & percival ( 1997 ) and references therein .",
    "the second is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is flux of radiant energy from each face of the disk , @xmath44 is the disk temperature , @xmath45 is the radiation constant , and  is the electron - scattering opacity ( appropriate for the inner disk ) .",
    "the equation of state is given by @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is the semi - thickness of the disk , @xmath48 is the proton mass , and @xmath49 is boltzmann s constant .      together with the relation @xmath51 for the viscous stress , @xmath52 being the standard disk viscosity parameter ( ss73 ; nt73 ) , equations ( 7)-(10 ) yield the following results for the surface densities of gpd and rpd disks : @xmath53    @xmath54 radial variations of  and  are shown , and also as @xmath55 , are unphysical , of course . in reality",
    ", the former rise is terminated where the rpd region joins smoothly to a gpd region at sufficiently large radii , and the latter is terminated close to , where there is a transition from keplerian flow to free - fall via a gr analogue of roche - lobe overflow ( see text ) .",
    "] in figure 1 in the schwarzschild limit .",
    "@xmath50 relations for gpd and rpd disks are shown explicitly in figures 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "for gpd disks , the newtonian property @xmath28 is valid for all radii larger than that at which  attains its maximum ,",
    "_ i.e. _ , @xmath56 . however , between the maxima of  and @xmath17 , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the region @xmath57 , @xmath27 , since @xmath17 decreases with increasing @xmath58 there , but  increases . at @xmath59 , @xmath28",
    "again , as both @xmath17 and  increase with @xmath58 .",
    "thus , between the lower , newtonian branch of the @xmath50 relation shown in figure 2 ( on which @xmath60 , and @xmath61 as eq.[11 ] shows , so that @xmath62 ) , and the upper , gr branch , both of which are viscously stable , there is a considerable transition region ( @xmath57 in the schwarzschild limit ) which is unstable to the viscous mode .",
    "hence , blobs of matter are expected to form in this annular region of gpd disks .",
    "the ultimate fate of these blobs merit further study : it is clear that , as they drift radially into the stable region at @xmath63 , viscous stresses will tend to smoothen them out , but a significant fraction of blobs may survive to the disk s inner edge , since the drift timescale through this stable region exceeds the fastest stabilization timescale only by a factor @xmath64 .    for rpd disks , the lower , newtonian branch of the @xmath50 relation ( on which @xmath29 and @xmath27 ) is almost identical to the upper , gr branch , with no transition region visible in the main panel of figure 3",
    ". a closer inspection of the curve s tip ( inset ) does reveal an extremely small transition region ( @xmath65 ) over which @xmath28 , corresponding to the region between the maximum of @xmath17 and the minimum of @xmath66 in figure 1 .",
    "although this tiny region is viscously stable in principle , it has no significant effect on the stability properties of rpd disks , which would be expected to form blobs over their entire extent from the arguments given so far ( but see below ) .",
    "finally , the stabilizing effect ( a81 , a85 ) of the mass - inflow through the inner edge of the disk to the central object via a gr analogue of roche - lobe overflow ( abramowicz , calvani & nobili 1980 , henceforth acn , and references therein ) is likely to have minor consequences for most of the results found here , particularly for gpd disks .",
    "found originally ( a81 ) by applying p78 s newtonian stability analysis to the above gr mass - inflow through inner edges of thick , rpd , non - keplerian disks with super - eddington accretion rates ( acn ) , this effect is now understood to stabilize the _ transonic _",
    "part ( a85 ) of the accretion flow thermally ( and possibly also viscously ) , as well as the supersonic part of the flow interior to .",
    "however , the radial extent @xmath67 of the transonic regions at the inner edges of the thin , keplerian disks under consideration here is very small , typically @xmath68 ( miller , lamb & psaltis 1998 , henceforth mlp , and references therein ) , comparable to the small vertical thicknesses ( a85 ) of the transonic flows . for rpd disks",
    ", this will lead to the formation of an additional , small , stable annulus around , but there is virtually no change for gpd disks , since this region is stable anyway .",
    "similar arguments apply to those keplerian disks around weakly - magnetized neutron stars which are terminated at radii @xmath11 by non - gravitational forces , _ e.g. _ , radiation drag ( mlp ) .",
    "underlying the phenomenon described here is a basic difference between the scalings of  and  with @xmath17 in @xmath52-disks which does not seem to have been fully appreciated so far .",
    "apart from the ( minor ) effects of the factors @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath40 , the @xmath50 relation for rpd disks , @xmath69 , is independent of @xmath58 , but that for gpd disks , @xmath70 , is not . hence , when @xmath17 develops a maximum at @xmath71 as a result of the gr boundary condition , and runs through the same set of values ( see figure 1 ) for @xmath72 ( newtonian branch ) and @xmath73 ( gr branch ) , corresponding values of  are essentially the same on the two branches , but those of  are quite different ( see figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "the maximum of  occurs at that of @xmath74 , which is quite different from that of @xmath17 . in the region between the two maxima ,",
    "the viscous stress is clearly always a decreasing function of , and the disk viscously unstable .",
    "this behavior is robust ( but see below ) in the sense that it depends not on the details of how gr is introduced , but only on the basic scaling @xmath75 , which is valid even in the newtonian limit : this is why the ss73 formulation and its acls generalization give results which are qualitatively the same as that given here .",
    "all @xmath52-disks show the above scalings for rpd and gpd regions because  scales as @xmath76 in such disks , but  as @xmath77 , @xmath78 being the keplerian angular velocity : the reason for this is clear from the vertical structure relations .",
    "these relations involve @xmath78 twice : in that of vertical equilibrium ( eq.[7 ] ) , and in that of viscous dissipation rate ( eq.[9 ] ) .",
    "there is a cancellation between the two @xmath78s for rpd disks , but _ not _ for gpd disks , because pressure is independent of @xmath26 for the former , but not for the latter ( le ; l74b ) .",
    "of course , this reasoning applies only to @xmath52-disks , as did that of le .",
    "investigations of the corresponding properties of gr non - keplerian disks , particularly advection - dominated disks ( gammie & popham 1998 and references therein ) appear worthwhile .",
    "astrophysical applications of our results will be given in detail elsewhere . while the focus of the stability analyses of inner disks in the 1970s was on bright , galactic black - hole candidates , where accretion rates are normally high enough to ensure rpd inner regions",
    ", it is now clear that accretion rates in many x - ray binaries containing black holes and weakly - magnetized neutron stars can be low enough ( @xmath79 of the eddington rate ) that inner disks are gpd all the way to their inner edges at @xmath80 .",
    "low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) , and , in particular , `` atoll '' type lmxbs with very low neutron - star magnetic fields and accretion rates of the above order , are prime examples of the latter case . signatures of the phenomena described here may be observable in timing studies of lmxbs by @xmath12 , particularly in the kilohertz quasiperiodic oscillations ( henceforth khzqpo ; see , _ e.g. _ , van der klis 1998 , henceforth k98 ) .",
    "we note that the keplerian frequencies corresponding to the unstable region in gpd disks around slowly - rotating central objects are @xmath81 hz , similar to the frequency difference between the twin khzqpos observed in lmxbs .",
    "furthermore , khzqpo diagnostics of any residual blobs present in the region between the disk s inner edge and that of the viscously unstable region ( see  3.2 ) does not appear impossible ( angelini 1998 , private communication ) ."
