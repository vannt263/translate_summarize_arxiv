    "the use of modular invariance was initiated in @xcite .",
    "the conformal bootstrap program to exploit crossing symmetry was pioneered in @xcite , was developed further in two dimensions starting with @xcite , and is currently undergoing a renaissance in higher dimensions starting with @xcite .",
    "the quintessential application of modular invariance is the cardy formula @xcite , which describes the spectral density for a large scaling dimension @xmath8 with a fixed value of the central charge @xmath9 . in @xcite , crossing symmetry was used to estimate the spectral density weighted by the ope coefficients , for large @xmath8 with a fixed value of the scaling dimension @xmath0 of the external operator @xmath10 in ( [ fourpoint ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the different limits : @xmath11 for the partition function , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for the four - point function . here",
    "@xmath14 is the spacetime dimension .    the limit ( [ climit ] ) for the partition function was considered in @xcite , where it was shown that the cardy formula holds for @xmath15 under a certain condition on light spectrum , strengthening the result of @xcite , which held only in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "in this paper , we will describe an approximate symmetry of spectral decomposition of the partition function , which can be used to motivate this result .",
    "moreover , this symmetry suggests some bounds for the spectral density , which we derive by independent techniques .",
    "we employ a similar approach to study the limit ( [ deltalimit ] ) of the four - point function to derive properties of the spectral density weighted by the ope coefficients as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "this approach proves to be universal and we apply it also to the case of large spacetime dimension .",
    "to study the partition function in two dimensions , we will use the following simplified expression : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the density of conformal primary states with scaling dimension @xmath8 .",
    "this formula ignores contributions from virasoro descendants , which will turn out to be subleading in @xmath19 in what follows .",
    "another interpretation is that @xmath18 is the density of all states , not just the primaries , in which case the above formula is valid literally .",
    "the spins of primary states are not visible when @xmath20 is real and @xmath4 is pure imaginary , which we will assume throughout the paper .",
    "our basic observation is that modular invariance @xmath21 implies the following approximate reflection symmetry in the space of scaling dimension @xmath8 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is defined by , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denotes convolution , @xmath26 . here",
    "the kernel @xmath27 smears the integrand of over the interval of size @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "note however that @xmath27 decays rather slowly outside of this interval  see section iii.a.1 . with this definition ,",
    "@xmath30 measures the significance of @xmath8 in the partition function averaged over the small interval of the size @xmath28 to smooth out the sum of delta - functions in @xmath18 .",
    "since @xmath8 is bounded below by @xmath31 in any unitary theory , @xmath32 approximately vanishes for @xmath33 .",
    "the reflection symmetry ( [ reflectiontau ] ) maps this to , @xmath34 where the edge @xmath35 is given by , @xmath36 we can estimate how fast the integrand of decays above this threshold @xmath37 , @xmath38 , as , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the degree @xmath41 chebyshev polynomial of the first kind and @xmath42 is chosen so that @xmath43 . in the limit of @xmath44 , the half decay width of the right hand side",
    "is @xmath45 .",
    "of course , from cardy formula one expects exponential rather than polynomial decay , but this formula shows the specific threshold value @xmath35 , beyond which there can be no dominant contribution to @xmath46 . from the discussion in @xcite it follows that there exist theories which essentially saturate this bound , i.e. for which the integral is dominated by states at @xmath35 .",
    "this happens in theories satisfying the sparse light spectrum condition , defined in @xcite as , @xmath47 where the inequality should be understood in an averaged sense .",
    "the essence of this condition is that the partition function for the low temperature phase @xmath48 is dominated by the vacuum state ( in particular , the maximum of @xmath49 is at @xmath50 ) . in this case",
    ", the reflection symmetry shows that the maximum of @xmath49 jumps to the edge @xmath35 in the high temperature phase @xmath51 , and gives a prediction on the value of this maximum . with @xmath4 changing in the high - temperature phase the maximum at @xmath35 scans through the region @xmath52 , allowing one to obtain information on @xmath18 in this region .",
    "rigorous microscopic estimates were made in @xcite , and the resulting cardy - like formula is @xmath53 for @xmath52 and the average density of states , @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 .      in this section",
    "we consider the four - point function of identical scalar operators of scaling dimension @xmath0 .",
    "we insert the four operators on one two - dimensional plane , which we identify with the complex plane of variable @xmath7 .",
    "we insert three scalars at @xmath57 and the fourth scalar at the dolan - osborn coordinate @xmath7 .",
    "this four - point function ( [ fourpoint ] ) can be expressed as a sum of the spectral density weighted by the ope coefficients and the conformal block @xmath58 for the scaling dimension @xmath8 and the spin @xmath59 , see e.g. @xcite . here and throughout the paper , we assume that the coordinate @xmath7 is real and @xmath60 .    as a by - product of our work",
    ", we find an expression for @xmath58 for general @xmath59 in the scaling limit ( [ deltalimit ] ) , when external operators are identical scalars . in appendix",
    "a , we will solve the fourth order differential equation derived in @xcite for the conformal block to show , for @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radial coordinate , @xmath64 introduced in @xcite and discussed further in @xcite . note that this approximation breaks down when @xmath65 .",
    "this should be kept in mind when interpreting the formulas below .",
    "in general the results of this section apply to the limit @xmath66 with @xmath7 kept fixed . in this limit ,",
    "spin dependence of the conformal block is only through the exponent @xmath67 , which behaves as , @xmath68 here in the first case @xmath59 can be on the order of @xmath8 , but has to stay away from the unitarity bound . between the two cases @xmath69 can acquire @xmath63 dependence .",
    "however , the results in the two regimes suggest that the factor @xmath70 in the conformal block ( [ approximateblock ] ) is altogether negligible in the large @xmath8 analysis in this paper , just as virasoro descendants are negligible in the partition function as in ( [ partitionlimit ] ) .",
    "thus , we can express the four - point function in the scaling limit ( [ deltalimit ] ) as , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the spectral density weighted by the square of the ope coefficients , which is non - negative when @xmath10 s are identical .",
    "one can of course keep this subleading factor in what follows without affecting the conclusions .",
    "note that though we made no assumptions on the spins of the intermediate states , the spectral decomposition of @xmath73 is blind to them for real @xmath7 and large scaling dimensions .",
    "one can also view as an exact expansion , in which we have discarded the structure of conformal multiplets and treat primary and descendant operators on equal footing .",
    "this is the radial coordinates expansion of @xcite .",
    "below we also consider another kind of `` descendant '' expansion , which corresponds to a different choice of coordinates .    since the spectral decomposition of the four - point function ( [ fourpointlimit ] ) is similar to that of the partition function ( [ partitionlimit ] ) in these limits",
    ", crossing symmetry @xmath74 implies a similar reflection symmetry in @xmath8 .",
    "let us introduce the `` branching ratio '' of @xmath75 turning into operators of dimension @xmath8 , @xmath76 with @xmath77 averaging over intervals of the size @xmath78 . in terms of this quantity ,",
    "the approximate reflection symmetry is expressed as , @xmath79 the reflection of @xmath80 is then , @xmath81 where the edge @xmath82 is given by , @xmath83 as in the case of the partition function ( [ abovethreshold ] ) , we can estimate how fast @xmath84 decays above the threshold @xmath85 , @xmath86 as , @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "note that the half - decay width is @xmath89 .",
    "this can be compared to the conformal block expansion of the correlation function of the generalized free field , @xmath90 which can be shown , as long as @xmath7 is away from @xmath91 , to have a saddle point at @xmath92 of width @xmath93 . in this order - of - magnitude sense",
    "the bound is almost saturated .",
    "we can also perform the `` descendant '' expansion in the standard coordinates described in the beginning of this section ( see e.g. @xcite ) , again treating primary and descendant operators on equal footing , @xmath94 where we added the superscript @xmath95 to @xmath72 to note the fact that we are expanding @xmath73 in what we will henceforth call `` scaling blocks '' .",
    "we use a similar notation for branching ratios @xmath96 .",
    "all of the above results also hold in this case , with the modification that now @xmath97 the reflection relation is @xmath98      so far , our statements have been in the limit ( [ deltalimit ] ) of large @xmath8 and @xmath0 . in the case of the scaling block decomposition of four - point function , we can derive inequalities which are valid at finite @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for @xmath99 , @xmath100 where @xmath101 note that this bound also implies a bound on individual delta - function contributions to @xmath102 , since they are all positive .",
    "if we keep @xmath0 finite and take @xmath103 , this inequality becomes , @xmath104    in this limit , this inequality is stronger than the asymptotic bound of @xcite , @xmath105 however , the cardy - like asymptotic of @xcite , @xmath106 suggests by differentiation that one can expect the stronger convergence rate of @xmath107 while is weaker than this expectation , it has the advantage that it is rigorous and holds for finite @xmath8 and @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , the method we use for proving this bound is quite general and can be used for construction of finite @xmath8 and @xmath0 analytic bounds for as well .",
    "we have checked that these bounds are asymptotically at least as strong as those of @xcite , still having the advantage of being valid for finite values of @xmath8 .",
    "given the improvement of over , one might expect that an improvement is possible for as well .",
    "we hope to return to this question in future .",
    "so far , we did not assume that the four - point function is dominated by a saddle point .",
    "if we make this assumption , our results have simple explanation .",
    "let the location of the saddle point in the expansion of @xmath73 be @xmath108 , which has to obey the reflection relation imposed by crossing symmetry , @xmath109 this is most easy to see if we note that @xmath110 and apply the crossing relation @xmath111 .",
    "in unitary theory @xmath112 , which implies , by the above relation , @xmath113      an analogue of the sparse light spectrum condition ( [ sparselightspectrumcondition ] ) for the four point function can be introduced , namely , @xmath114 again , this should be understood in some averaged sense , such that this condition would imply that the four - point function for @xmath115 is dominated by the vacuum state .",
    "then , by the reflection symmetry , the maximum of @xmath84 jumps to the edge @xmath35 for @xmath116 .",
    "this , exactly as in the case of the partition function , can be translated into a statement on @xmath117 , which reads , for @xmath118 , @xmath119 ,      \\label{4ptcardy}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 , and @xmath120 is @xmath102 integrated on the scale @xmath121 .",
    "so far we have only discussed the limits where the operators considered were heavy compared to any other scales we had , and in particular far away from the unitarity bounds .",
    "some interesting phenomena happen near unitarity bounds , such as that a scalar field has to become free as its scaling dimension is pushed toward the bound . in this section",
    "we consider a limit in which we take not only the scaling dimension of the external scalars , but also the number of spacetime dimensions @xmath14 to be large .",
    "in fact , when the number of spacetime dimensions is taken to be large , the unitarity bounds force all the operators to become heavy .",
    "we are then able to apply the same methods as before , but now to all operators in the theory .",
    "recall that the unitarity bounds are @xmath122 and thus the natural limit is the double scaling @xmath123 . in this limit we can see the gap between the identity and the lightest allowed scalars and the difference between the lightest scalars and the lightest spin operator .",
    "appearance of these features means that now we have to distinguish several classes of operators .",
    "it turns out that for us there is no difference between spin and scalar operators , since on the real line @xmath124 the conformal blocks in a large number of spacetime dimension do not depend on spin ( for details on conformal blocks see appendix  [ app : doublescale ] ) .",
    "however , the gap above the identity is important and the identity operator has to be treated separately .",
    "as mentioned before , we can apply almost the same methods as we used in other limits .",
    "a new feature is that the duality relation is now non - linear and is not as pleasant to manipulate as in the above discussions .",
    "however , it carries more information , since we are now able to take our external scalars close to the unitarity bound .",
    "let us introduce the duality relation .",
    "we state it in the following form , @xmath125 this has to be understood as an implicit relation between the symmetry - related scaling dimensions @xmath8 in the conformal block expansion at @xmath7 and @xmath126 at @xmath127 . here",
    "@xmath128 is given by @xmath129 and @xmath130 is the spin - independent conformal block .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath128 is cumbersome , but is straightforwardly obtained from for @xmath131 . for the identity operator @xmath132 , and so we get @xmath133 .",
    "one can easily obtain the range of @xmath128 corresponding to the unitary range @xmath134 .",
    "it is given by @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "now , let us apply the duality relation to this range  in this way we will obtain the allowed range for the saddle point in the conformal block decomposition . the result is , in terms of @xmath137 , @xmath138.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    0.45        0.45     this range is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] .",
    "the case of @xmath139 is generic and is shown in fig .  [ fig : lambda_1 ] .",
    "as the external scalar gets heavier , @xmath140 gets larger and the range fills the region between the curves corresponding to the identity operator and its dual image .",
    "an interesting thing happens as @xmath140 approaches the unitarity bound @xmath141 , fig  [ fig : lambda_05 ] . the allowed range for @xmath128 shrinks into three points .",
    "this is the manifestation of the fact that a scalar at the unitarity bound has to be free .",
    "let us remind the reader of the reasoning .",
    "the unitarity bound @xmath142 expresses non - negativity of the norm of a descendant of @xmath143 , which thus becomes null at the unitarity bound .",
    "this implies that @xmath143 satisfies the free field equation of motion @xmath144 as an operator equation , and all the correlation functions of @xmath143 are harmonic away from singularities .",
    "then one can take for example the four point function of @xmath143 and subtract the free field four point function .",
    "the result @xmath145 is still harmonic and the ope limits imply that it has singularities weaker than those of free field , @xmath146 . but",
    "@xmath146 is the weakest singularity a harmonic function can have .",
    "thus , @xmath145 is harmonic everywhere , tends to zero at infinity and is therefore @xmath31 .",
    "so the four point function of @xmath143 is that of the free field , which in turn implies that the @xmath147 ope is also free .",
    "note that the above argument explicitly imposes the equation of motion of @xmath143 on the four point function .",
    "it is not a priori obvious that the crossing equation for this four point function alone should also imply that @xmath143 must be free at the unitarity bound .",
    "however , it seems to be the case as the numerical results suggest ( e.g. @xcite in four spacetime dimensions ) . from our perspective , it is true as long as one excludes the middle curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda_05 ] . if this is done , then duality at @xmath148 tells us that there are to equally important saddle points , and for other values of @xmath7 one of them dominates , just as in the previous discussion .",
    "the resulting behavior is characteristic of the free field , to the accuracy of our approximation .",
    "section iii is devoted to derivations .",
    "some of technical details are discussed in appendices , including the derivation of ( [ approximateblock ] ) .",
    "here we discuss the derivation of the reflection symmetry .",
    "we do not try to make the derivation very detailed or completely rigorous , since we only use as a heuristic device , and our other derivations are independent of it .    parametrizing @xmath4 in the partition function as , @xmath149 the modular transformation @xmath2 becomes the reflection @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , @xmath151 and this can be expressed the integral constraints on @xmath49 as , @xmath152^{(2k+1 ) } \\omega_{\\tau = i}(\\delta ) d\\delta = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is defined by ( [ significancetau ] ) and the bracket symbol @xmath153^{(2k+1)}$ ] is defined by , @xmath154^{(n ) } & \\equiv e^{2\\pi y e^x } \\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)^n e^{-2\\pi y e^x}{}_{\\big| x=0 } , \\nonumber\\\\ & = y^n \\left ( 1 + \\frac{n(n-1)}{2y } + \\cdots \\right ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath155 , we can approximate @xmath156^{(n)}$ ] by the monomial @xmath157 .",
    "note that if we use the full virasoro character instead of @xmath158 , this approximation is still valid .",
    "it is in this sense in which we said previously that virasoro descendants are subleading .",
    "therefore , @xmath159 for @xmath160 , assuming that the region near @xmath161 does not make a major contribution to the integral , which is consistent with results we will find .",
    "this suggests that @xmath162 is approximately symmetric under reflection at @xmath161 : @xmath163 if the dominant contribution came from @xmath164 , approximate symmetry like this would be self - evident .    of course",
    ", one can not expect a literal equality like this  in the end , we only have a finite number of equations . to formulate a more precise statement ,",
    "let us look at the case of general @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath165 , we have for any @xmath166 , @xmath167 which , with similar approximations , translates into @xmath168^k \\omega_\\tau(\\delta)d\\delta=\\\\      = \\int_0^\\infty\\left[\\frac{2\\pi}{|\\tau|}\\left(\\frac{c}{12}-\\delta\\right)\\right]^k \\omega_{-1/\\tau}(\\delta)d\\delta ,      \\label{momentseq}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for @xmath169 .",
    "this is now an equality between some polynomial moments of @xmath170 and @xmath171 , which after some linear changes of arguments and densities @xmath172 can be translated into @xmath173 where @xmath174 is a rescaled version of @xmath8 , and @xmath175 is the rescaled and renormalized version of @xmath172 .",
    "we will see below that with @xmath176 bounded above by @xmath177 , the integrals can be restricted to finite intervals of size @xmath178 , up to @xmath19 errors .",
    "then one has an equality of polynomial moments of two functions on finite interval . in other words , their convolutions with any polynomial kernel",
    "coincide , provided the degree of the polynomial is bounded by @xmath177 .",
    "one can then try to pick a delta - like kernel @xmath179 , for example , @xmath180 where @xmath181 is twice the size of the interval to which we restrict the integrals in .",
    "then , restoring the original variables , we have the required claim .",
    "note that this particular delta - like kernel would average over regions of size @xmath182 .",
    "one can do better , for details see @xcite .      as discussed in section [ sec : partresults ] , the reflection symmetry suggests that @xmath183 approximately vanishes for @xmath37 . to understand how good the statement is",
    ", we should estimate an upper bound on @xmath49 when @xmath8 goes above the threshold @xmath35 . at @xmath184 ,",
    "the conditions on @xmath185 are , @xmath186^{(2k-1 ) } \\omega_{i}(\\delta ) d\\delta = 0 , \\label{linearconditions}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , @xmath187 what we want to do is to estimate an upper bound on @xmath185 at a particular value @xmath188 by maximizing the value of @xmath185 under these conditions .",
    "this is a typical linear optimization problem .    generally speaking ,",
    "the maximum value ( optimal value for the primal problem ) of @xmath189 subject to , @xmath190 is equal to the minimum value ( optimal value for the dual problem ) of @xmath191 subject to @xmath192 this is a statement of the strong duality theorem of linear programming @xcite , which is valid for finite - dimensional vector spaces . in our case",
    ", @xmath193 is an infinite dimensional vector whose entries are values of @xmath185 at different values of @xmath8 , @xmath194 is a set of integral transforms mapping @xmath185 to the left - hand side of ( [ linearconditions ] ) , and @xmath195 as in its right - hand side .",
    "although we still expect the strong duality to hold in our case , we really need only the weak duality , which says that the optimal value for the dual problem ( in fact , any feasible value ) puts an upper bound on the optimal value of the primal problem .",
    "this weaker duality is straightforward to see .",
    "indeed , let @xmath7 be a solution to , then for any @xmath196 a solution to we have @xmath197    before discussing what the dual problem is in our case , we first note that maximizing @xmath198 does not make much sense , since @xmath199 appears only inside the integrals in the constraint equations , and thus its value at a point is irrelevant unless @xmath199 has a delta - function singularity at @xmath200 .",
    "therefore , it only makes sense to maximize the coefficient of delta - singularity in @xmath199 at @xmath200 .",

    "since @xmath227 is odd under the reflection @xmath228 , within the reflection symmetric interval @xmath229 , @xmath226 also implies @xmath230 .",
    "namely , @xmath231 under the condition @xmath232 , the maximum of @xmath233 is achieved by the degree @xmath224 chebyshev polynomial of the first kind @xmath234 with @xmath235 @xcite .",
    "notably , the polynomial is independent of @xmath200 .",
    "we were so far optimizing the coefficient of delta function in @xmath198 .",
    "however , it turns out that the bound we found is also a bound for the integral @xmath236 . indeed ,",
    "optimizing this integral would replace with @xmath237 for all @xmath238 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath239 corresponding to the chebyshev polynomial solution satisfies this stronger constraint as well .",

    "similarly , for a general value of @xmath38 , the tail at the threshold @xmath35 can be bounded as , @xmath242 for @xmath37 . to see this , recall the condition , which for odd powers of @xmath174 can rewritten as @xmath243 and @xmath244 and @xmath245 $ ] .",

    "more precisely , @xmath27 can be used as @xmath254 in the aforementioned generalized bound on @xmath255 .",
    "this justifies truncating the integrals in .      unlike the case of the partition function in two dimensions , where contributions from virasoro descendants are subleading in @xmath19 ,",

    "where @xmath302 this leads to an inequality for @xmath303 , which , upon picking an optimal value of @xmath7 , reads for @xmath304 as @xmath305 one also gets a different inequality for @xmath306 .",
    "then one replaces @xmath295 in these inequalities with a new @xmath307 and takes the latter to be sufficiently small while keeping the @xmath295 in @xmath308 fixed .",
    "this allows one to bound the contribution from @xmath309 and @xmath310 up to @xmath311 error terms .",
    "the contribution from @xmath312 is also bounded @xcite .",
    "it then follows that given @xmath121 , @xmath296 @xmath298 dominates the 4-point function , and the inequality turns into the equality .",
    "in the present paper we studied implications of modular invariance and crossing symmetry in certain scaling limits . we have found that all these cases share certain general features , in particular    1 .   a truncated set of crossing equations limits to a problem about polynomial moments of the branching ratios .",
    "this leads to an approximate duality relation for the branching ratios at crossing symmetric points .",
    "the duality relation motivates tail bounds for the integrals of the branching ratios .",
    "these bounds are threshold bounds in the sense that they constrain the set of dominant scaling dimensions .",
    "`` sparseness '' of the light spectrum implies universality of the couplings of heavy spectrum .",
    "such theories almost saturate the tail bounds .",
    "we discussed this only in two cases , but it is clear that this is a general feature .",
    "these facts have a natural explanation if one assumes that a single saddle point dominates the expansions .",
    "indeed , in this case the location of saddle point can be determined easily by taking appropriate log - derivative of the four - point or partition function .",
    "the crossing relation then imposes an equation on this location in a straightforward way .",
    "note , however , that at no point we made such an assumption .",
    "in fact , one can assume that several competing saddle points may exist at some points , and in this case our duality relation maps their positions to the crossing symmetric expansion .",
    "this happens for example for generalized free field , which at @xmath148 exhibits two saddle points ",
    "one at @xmath50 and one at @xmath313 ( in scaling blocks ) .",
    "these two saddles are correctly related by the duality relation .    besides this",
    "general features , we have also found features specific for some of the cases , in particular    1 .   for scaling block expansion of four point function we were able to use an ansatz incorporating infinitely many derivatives to produce an exponentially decaying tail bound .",
    "this bound is a strict inequality valid without taking any limit whatsoever .",
    "2 .   for the large spacetime dimension limit of the conformal block expansion",
    ", we were able to see a manifestation of unitarity bound for external scalars without the use of the free scalar equation of motion .",
    "most of our results used some kind of a limit , and thus are not applicable to the bootstrap of light operators .",
    "however , one may hope that some qualitative features also carry over to the case of light operators , and thus may provide useful intuition .",
    "let us discuss possible implications for numerical analysis .    in some cases ,",
    "the four - point amplitude @xmath73 is dominated by operators near the saddle point @xmath108 .",
    "this observation may have applications to numerical bootstrap methods . which often employ derivatives of the crossing relation at @xmath148 .",
    "this mostly probes operators near the saddle point @xmath314 . to learn about the other parts of the spectrum ,",
    "apart from taking more and more derivatives at @xmath148 , one may consider the crossing relation at different values of @xmath7 . in the case of scaling blocks ,",
    "it is natural to expect that @xmath315 changes in @xmath316 result in @xmath317 changes in @xmath108 and that the width of saddle point is on the order of @xmath318 .",
    "therefore , in order to have the spectrum up to @xmath319 evenly covered , one may use the bootstrap equation at @xmath320 points @xmath7 so that @xmath316 is distributed evenly with spacing of the order of @xmath321 .",
    "another observation is that gaps in ope spectrum can render the parts of spectrum symmetric to them difficult to study .",
    "an example is the generalized free field four point function , which is @xmath322 it can be easily seen to be dominated by the vacuum term @xmath323 for @xmath324 . as discussed above , this forces a discontinuity in @xmath108 at @xmath148 , with @xmath325 . in this theory",
    "there are no operators in the interval @xmath326 , but there are operators in @xmath327 , which by the approximate symmetry never dominate the four - point function .",
    "* note added : * toward completion of this manuscript , the paper @xcite appeared , which uses an idea similar to that developed in this paper to study the semi - classical limit of conformal field theory in two dimensions .",
    "we have also been informed on the forthcoming paper @xcite , which improves the results of @xcite for the convergence of conformal block expansion .",
    "the new paper introduces a surprisingly simple expression for conformal blocks on the real line in 3d , and then uses it to transform the bounds of @xcite for `` descendant '' expansion to a better asymptotic bound for the exact conformal block expansion",

    "we see that in the leading @xmath352 order only @xmath340 and @xmath355 appear .",
