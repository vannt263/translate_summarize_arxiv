    "the dark matter particles can be directly detected through their scatterings off the familiar nucleons and/or indirectly detected through their annihilations / decays into the sm species .",
    "recently , the fermi - lat data on the cosmic gamma - ray spectrum from the galactic center ( gc ) have revealed a tentative evidence for a line - like feature at an energy around @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "such monochromatic photon can be induced by a dark matter annihilation or decay .",
    "there have been a lot of models @xcite realizing the required dark matter annihilations or decays .",
    "usually , we need some particles heavier than the dark matter to mediate the significant annihilations or decays of the dark matter into the monochromatic photons at loop level since the dark matter is only allowed to have an extremely tiny electric charge @xcite . on the other hand , in the @xmath3 left - right symmetric models @xcite for universal @xcite seesaw @xcite , some heavy @xmath2$]-singlet leptons and quarks are well motivated to alleviate the hierarchy among the sm fermion masses and solve the strong cp problem @xcite",
    ". such heavy fermions could take part in mediating the radiative dark matter annihilations or decays for the @xmath0 gamma - ray line . in this paper",
    ", we shall demonstrate this possibility in a multi - component dark matter @xcite scenario .",
    "specifically , we shall introduce a @xmath1 dark sector which contains two vector - like fermions besides the related gauge and higgs fields .",
    "there is also a very heavy messenger scalar having the yukawa couplings with the dark fermions and the heavy leptons .",
    "the heavier dark fermion can have a very long lifetime although it mostly decays into the lighter dark fermion with a photon .",
    "the dark fermions can obtain the desired dark matter relic density through their annihilations into the dark gauge and higgs fields .",
    "as the @xmath1 and @xmath6 gauge fields are allowed to have a kinetic mixing , the dark matter fermions can be verified by the ongoing and forthcoming dark matter direct detection experiments .",
