    "the measurement of a physical quantity @xmath2 on a quantum system , as it is introduced as a well known postulate of quantum mechanics , is based on a _ single , instantaneous _ measurement which is sharp and has a strong back influence on the system . restricting for simplicity to a non - degenerate discrete spectrum , to a pure state and to a selective measurement , then _ sharp _ ( or _ perfect _ ) means that the measurement yields exactly an eigenvalue @xmath3 of the observable @xmath2 as the only possible result . that the measurement is _ hard _ ( or its influence is _ strong _ ) means that it results in a transition of the state of the system to the respective eigenvector of the observable _ ( projection measurement)_. for the probability of finding the result @xmath3 , reference is made to a large number of single measurements on equally prepared states _",
    "( ensemble)_.    in contrast to this we want to discuss in the following a general class of quantum measurements . instead of a single instantaneous measurement",
    ", we consider a _ continuous _ measurement performed on one and the same _ single _ quantum system over a certain time leading to a measurement readout which is a function of time @xmath4 .",
    "the influence on the system is allowed to be _ weak _ ( or _ the measurement to be soft _ ) which means that the system is not transferred to an eigenstate and that the readout must not agree with an eigenvalue .",
    "accordingly a weak measurement does not discriminate between eigenvalues . in this sense",
    "the measurement is _ unsharp _ ( or of _ low resolution _ ) . the readout @xmath4 need not to be close to the eigenvalues @xmath3 . during short intervals",
    "the readout curves may even show large deflections from @xmath3 .",
    "in addition for the same initial state and the same continuous measurement , there may result different readouts , with a certain probability distribution . because of these characteristic properties of this type of measurement , which originate from its quantum nature , we call the whole class continuous _ fuzzy _ measurements .    in the last decades",
    "continuous quantum measurements were considered intensively .",
    "we mention that such a measurement is closely related with the phenomenon of decoherence . in the context of the emergence of classical properties",
    "this phenomenon has recently been discussed in @xcite where also an extensive survey of the literature may be found .",
    "the realization of a continuous measurement may consist of a series of short measurements during which the quantum system interacts with the measurement device . if this interaction is weak in a specific sense the state of the system does not transit to an eigenvector of the respective observable . in the intervals between",
    ", the system follows its internal dynamics .",
    "depending on the weakness of the measurement interaction and the lengths of the intervals between , fuzziness may be obtained . in this paper",
    "we describe the underlying physical microstructures in detail .",
    "a particular limiting case of our general class of continuous measurements is the well known quantum _",
    "zeno effect _ which has been predicted and then confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the content of this effect is that a continuous measurement which is sharp prevents transitions between discrete spectrum states ( for example atom levels ) .",
    "the reason for this strong influence is that the considered continuous measurement is in fact approximated by a series of very quickly repeated short measurements which are so strong that each of them projects the state of the system on one and the same discrete eigenstate .",
    "in @xcite such a procedure is called a  continuous projection measurement `` .",
    "the readout agrees constantly with the respective eigenvalue . in practice",
    "the influence on the measured system does not lead to an absolute freezing of its evolution but still modifies it considerably @xcite . in the specific setup of a three - level system",
    "a random telegraph - type signal may be obtained from the measured system as a consequence of its ' ' shelving \" @xcite .",
    "the zeno effect thus demonstrates in a most evident way that the back reaction during a continuous measurement may strongly influence the measured system .",
    "this motivates us to answer the following complementary questions : is it possible to measure continuously a single quantum system in such a weak way that the behavior of its state does not radically differ from what it would be if no measurement is performed ( this could be for example a rabi oscillation ) ? and is in the case of such a fuzzy measurement to be expected that the obtained continuous measurement readout reflects the motion of the state of the system thus making it visible ? to answer these questions is the first aim of this paper .    in the context of an ensemble approach ( non - selective description )",
    ", the continuous fuzzy measurement of an observable ( energy ) with discrete spectrum has been investigated in @xcite . in @xcite the probability for transition from one level to another",
    "was determined as an average over the ensemble of many identical measured systems ( equivalently , over the set of all possible measurement readouts ) . in @xcite",
    "the measurement readout averaged over the ensemble ( presented by a density matrix ) was shown to correlate with the rabi oscillations between the energy levels .",
    "however this approach does not give a complete picture of the behavior of an individual system like a single atom which is continuously measured .",
    "particularly , our question what are the dynamics of the system subject to a measurement with a certain readout can not be answered in the framework of the ensemble approach .",
    "this requires the selective description of the measurement .",
    "the phenomenological restricted - path - integral ( rpi ) approach @xcite to continuous fuzzy measurements sketched in section  [ sectphenomen ] provides such a selective description .",
    "it takes into account not only the back reaction onto the system caused by the measurement , but also specifies how it is determined by the information obtained in the concrete measurement readout . for a review of different phenomenological approaches",
    "see @xcite . the rpi approach , which is equivalent to the use of a complex hamiltonian , has first been used for continuous measurements of observables having continuous spectra .",
    "it also has been applied to a discrete - spectrum observable ( energy of a two - level system ) in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that the quantum zeno effect arises if the resolution of the measurement is good enough ( in comparison with the level difference ) .",
    "however the analysis given in @xcite was not complete because only the special case of constant measurement readouts coinciding with the energy levels @xmath5 was considered .",
    "a detailed analysis of the measurement of energy of a two - level system with arbitrary measurement readouts @xmath1 taken into account , so that fuzziness is incorporated , has been performed in @xcite .",
    "this analysis confirmed that the behavior of the system is of zeno - type with level transitions frozen if the resolution of the measurement is high ( hard measurement ) .",
    "the opposite regime of poor resolution or very fuzzy ( soft ) measurements has also been investigated . in this case",
    "the measurement influences the internal dynamics of the measured system only insignificantly . as a consequence of the low resolution",
    "the probability distribution of all possible readouts is very broad and a single readout does not contain reliable information about the systems evolution .    the most interesting regime of measurement is the intermediate regime .",
    "preliminary results obtained in @xcite show that in this case , when the resolution is not too low to give no information and not too high to lead to the zeno effect , induced transitions between levels ( for example rabi oscillations ) maintain though they are modified , and the measurement readout @xmath1 is correlated with these oscillations thus making them visible . below we will improve these studies in section  [ monitoring ] .    the phenomenological approach , although it seems to be convincing in itself , demands a microphysical justification .",
    "it is therefore the second aim of this paper to specify the details of the dynamics caused by a class of interactions of the two - level system with a subsidiary system which reproduce exactly the results predicted by the rpi approach to a continuous fuzzy measurement of energy .",
    "we then know how such a measurement of energy can be realized operationally and for which situations the phenomenological scheme may be used in practice . in section  [ realization ]",
    "we study the underlying dynamics and discuss a particular type of interaction .",
    "this generalizes an example given in @xcite .",
    "as far as experimental realizations are concerned , it is also a generalization of the quantum optical setup proposed in @xcite and considered in more detail in @xcite .",
    "but the aim of the latter two papers was not a continuous measurement in it own right but the decoherence of levels resulting from the long enough continuous measurement .",
    "in a first step we summarize very briefly the phenomenological and therefore model - independent rpi approach to continuous fuzzy measurements .",
    "the aim of this scheme is to include the effect of measurement on the dynamics of a _ single _ quantum system . the measuring apparatus and its interaction with the system is thereby only implicitly taken into account .",
    "it turns out that it is enough to know what information about the system the measurement supplies .",
    "below we formulate the theory directly with respect to the measurement of the observable energy .",
    "the more general scheme and additional details are described in @xcite .",
    "we discuss a system with a hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian of a `` free '' multilevel system and @xmath8 is an external potential .",
    "below we will assume that it acts as a driving field leading to transitions between levels .",
    "the continuous fuzzy measurement of energy during the time interval @xmath9 $ ] results in a curve @xmath10=\\{e(t ) | 0 \\le t \\le t\\}$ ] called the _",
    "measurement readout_.    the curve @xmath10 $ ] presents the information supplied by one specific continuous measurement process . because @xmath10 $ ] is assumed to be known we deal with a selective description of the measurement .",
    "our scheme has then to answer the following questions : given an initial state @xmath11 of the system for @xmath12 and a particular readout @xmath10 $ ] , what is i ) the probability density @xmath13 $ ] to obtain this readout in a measurement and ii ) what will be the state @xmath14 } \\rangle$ ] into which the system is transferred at the end of the measurement at time @xmath15 .",

    "its improvement with time reflects the remaining zeno - type influence of a fuzzy measurement carried out continuously .",

    "the first of these formulas may be applied to the evolution of pure states to which we will restrict below while the second is valid both for pure and mixed states .",

    "this is a remarkable result because @xmath173 refers as mean value to a large number of sharp energy measurements ( projection measurements ) on an ensemble that is characterized by the state @xmath147 the system assumes at time @xmath28 .",
    "operationally this has nothing to do with a continuous measurement ( or a sequence of measurements ) where the state of the system changes in time under the measurement .",
    "the indicated correspondence between @xmath1 and @xmath173 means roughly speaking the following : because of the weakness of an elementary observation it does not change the state significantly so that a succession of observations leads to similar results as many sharp measurements performed on the same state . but note that @xmath1 is only an estimate of @xmath173 obtained from a finite number of observations . in general they will differ .",
    "if the precision of this estimation is poor corresponding to the weakness of the measurement , then the actual value @xmath1 obtained does not have to be close to @xmath173 .",

    "our aim is now to discuss in more detail the assumptions made above in sections  [ realization - change ] ,  [ realization - comparison ] and to show that they are reasonable by sketching that they are fulfilled for a rather large class of interactions between a 2-level system and the meter .",
    "let our system with hamiltonian @xmath6 interact with the meter with hamiltonian @xmath174 via the interaction @xmath175 .",

    "measuring the subsystem meter by a macroscopic measuring apparatus transfers the 2-level system to one of the states of ( [ psi - plus - min ] ) , depending on whether the positive or negative result is registered .",
    "we introduce now that the interaction @xmath175 is not only of short duration @xmath77 but also weak .",
    "we assume for simplicity that in case of a negative result of the observation the final state of the meter coincides with its initial state , @xmath188 .",
    "this is fulfilled for the example given in @xcite based on scattering , where the outgoing state of an electron for the negative result of the observation ( no deflection ) agrees with its ingoing state ( before scattering ) .",
    "the consequence is the orthogonality of @xmath189 and @xmath190 so that we have up to a phase factor @xmath191    @xmath192    to represent fuzziness we have made above the assumption that @xmath101 and @xmath102 are close .",
    "this can be realized by choosing an interaction operator @xmath193 which has the same structure but slightly different coupling constants for the different levels of the measured system :    @xmath194    @xmath195 is here the pauli matrix acting in the two - dimensional space of levels 1 and 2 and @xmath196 is a number much smaller than 1 .",
    "then the final states of the measured system after the short interaction with the meter are    @xmath197    where    @xmath198    comparing eq .",

    "the level resolution time of ( [ tlr - pi ] ) becomes    @xmath200    thus , @xmath201 is a critical number of observations , leading to the resolution of energy levels ( see a detailed discussion of this resolution in @xcite ) .",
    "the phase factor in eq .",

    "this condition is fulfilled for the system considered in @xcite .",
    "thus the quantum - mechanical analysis of a simple model of a short observation of a two - level system proves that the resulting evolution of the system is in accord with the scheme postulated in section  [ realization - change ] .",
    "together with the consideration of the whole section  [ realization ] this proves that the continuous quantum measurement described phenomenologically in section  [ sectphenomen ] can be realized in practice .",
    "the meter system appropriate for such a realization may be chosen from a rather wide class considered above . moreover , this class may even be widened .",
    "in fact the only essential condition for the realization is that the interaction with the meter be weak ( and observations not too often ) .",
    "we have obtained the following results :    1 .",
    "it is possible to visualize the level transition of an externally driven single two - level system by a continuous measurement of energy , if its fuzziness is appropriately chosen .",
    "it is most adequate to show this within the phenomenological rpi - approach or to use the equivalent schrdinger equation with complex hamiltonian .",
    "the information obtained about the level transition has then a restricted but not too small reliability ( measurement noise is about 20% ) and may be obtained only at the price of changing the probability of the transition .",
    "2 .   measurements of this type may be realized by a long series of sufficiently weak interactions of the system with a quantum mechanical meter system , which is then measured by a macroscopic apparatus .",
    "fuzziness may be established this way .",
    "the discussion of the microphysical dynamics shows that the model reproduces the phenomenologically obtained results .",
    "the class of experimental setups which enable this realization is rather large .",
    "the microphysical investigations lead to operational interpretations of phenomenological quantities as for example the energy readout @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out to be the estimate of the mean value @xmath204 of the energy of the system with respect to its state @xmath0 at that time . that both energies must not agree exactly , leaves room for fuzziness .",
    "4 .   besides weakness of interactions with the meter , visualization of a quantum transition requires to neglect details of information .",
    "this is reflected 1 )  in the scheme for working out the only one number @xmath1 from a long series of interactions with the meter and 2 )  in the subsequent smoothing of the function @xmath205 .",
    "it is only after these two stages of roughening of the measurement results that they can be interpreted as the visualization of the transition .",
    "as far as an experimental realization is concerned , we add : the realization of the continuous measurement by a long series of elementary observations as described in sect .  [ realization ] generalizes the experimental setups proposed in @xcite .",
    "however the aim of the paper @xcite ( see also @xcite for more detailed discussion of the same setup ) was not the investigation of the continuous measurement in general , but the decoherence of levels resulting if the measurement is long enough ( in our notations , longer than decoherence time , @xmath206 ) . note that we referred to a different domain when discussing in sect .  [ monitoring ] how a driven level transition may be monitored by an appropriate continuous measurement .",
    "we close with two remarks : the scheme of the realization , though general enough , may be further generalized .",
    "in fact , almost any weak and short interaction with the two - level system which does not disturb its state significantly may be used to realize the fuzzy continuous measurement of energy .",
    "it is interesting that for a wide class of elementary observations their repetition leads to the simplest form of the continuous measurement characterized by a gaussian functional in the restricted path integral or by a quadratic imaginary term in the hamiltonian .",
    "the resulting measurement is characterized by only one single parameter , namely fuzziness .",
    "the interaction of the measured system with the meter may depend on many parameters , but only one combination of them , fuzziness , is important for the description of a resulting continuous measurement .",
    "this is quite analogous to the the well - known fact from probability theory ( proved in the central limiting theorem ) that the result of a long series of random events is normally distributed independently of the distributions of single events in the series .",
    "therefore , consideration in sect .",

    "<S> an analysis is given in the framework of the phenomenological restricted path integral approach ( rpi ) ( which reduces effectively to a schrdinger equation with a complex hamiltonian ) as well as with reference to the microphysical details of a class of concrete physical realizations . </S>",
    "<S> within the rpi approach it is demonstrated that for appropriately adjusted fuzziness , information about the evolution of the state of the system @xmath0 can be read off from the measurement readout @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown furthermore how a measurement of this type may be realized by a series of weak and short interactions of the two - level system with a quantum mechanical meter system . </S>",
    "<S> after each interaction a macroscopic measuring apparatus causes the meter to transit into one of two states . the result is used to generate the energy readout @xmath1 . in this way a complete agreement with the rpi approach is demonstrated which thus obtains an operational interpretation . </S>"
