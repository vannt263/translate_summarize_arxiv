    "the low - energy spectrum is a key character of excitations of nuclei in the presence of pairing correlations .",
    "the new spectroscopic studies of exotic nuclei stimulate a development of the nuclear models  @xcite to describe properties of nuclei away from the stability line .",
    "one of the standard tools for nuclear structure studies is the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) with the self - consistent mean - field derived by making use of effective nucleon - nucleon interactions which are taken whether as non - relativistic two - body forces  @xcite or derived from relativistic lagrangians  @xcite . since these qrpa calculations are performed with the same energy functional as that determining the mean - field one does not require to introduce new parameters .",
    "such an approach describes the properties of the low - lying states less accurately than more phenomenological ones , but the results are in a reasonable agreement with experimental data  @xcite .    when the residual interaction is separable@xcite , the qrpa equations can be easily solved no matter how many two - quasiparticle configurations are involved . starting from an effective interaction of the skyrme type",
    ", a finite rank separable approximation was proposed @xcite for the particle - hole ( p - h ) residual interaction .",
    "such an approach allows one to perform structure calculations in very large particle - hole spaces .",
    "thus , the self - consistent mean field can be calculated within the hartree - fock ( hf ) method with the original skyrme interactions whereas the rpa solutions are obtained with the finite rank approximation for the p - h matrix elements .",
    "this approach can be extended to include the pairing correlations within the bcs approximation  @xcite .",
    "alternative schemes to factorize the p - h interaction have also been considered in @xcite .",
    "due to the anharmonicity of vibrations there is a coupling between one - phonon and more complex states  @xcite and the complexity of calculations beyond the standard qrpa increases rapidly with the size of the configuration space .",
    "we have generalized our approach to take into account a coupling between the one- and two - phonon components of wave functions in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we follow the basic ideas of the quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm )  @xcite . however , the single - quasiparticle spectrum and the parameters of the residual interaction are calculated with skyrme forces .",
    "note that the qpm  @xcite can achieve very detailed predictions for nuclei away from closed shells  @xcite , but it is difficult to extrapolate the phenomenological parameters of the model hamiltonian to new regions of nuclei .",
    "in the present work , we propose an extension of our approach by taking into account the particle - particle ( p - p ) residual interaction . as an application we present the evolution of lowest quadrupole states in even - even nuclei around the @xmath5sn region .",
    "using the neutron - rich radioactive ion beams , the recent b(e2 ) measurements through coulomb excitation in inverse kinematics give an opportunity to compare our results and the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we sketch our method , where the residual interaction is obtained by the finite rank approximation .",
    "the hamiltonian is constructed in sec .",
    "iia whereas detailed expressions for the residual particle - particle interaction are in appendix a. we consider the qrpa equations in the case of separable residual interactions in sec .",
    "iib , and the solving of these equations is explained in appendix b. in sec .",
    "iii we show how this approach can be applied to treat the low - lying states .",
    "results of calculations for characteristics of the @xmath6 states in the sn , te isotopes and the n=82 isotones are discussed in sec .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the starting point of the method is the hf - bcs calculation  @xcite of the ground states . we restrict the present discussion to the case of spherical symmetry .",
    "the continuous part of the single - particle spectrum is discretized by diagonalizing the hf hamiltonian on a harmonic oscillator basis  @xcite .",
    "we work in the quasiparticle representation defined by the canonical bogoliubov transformation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 denote the quantum numbers @xmath9 .",
    "we use the skyrme interaction  @xcite in the p - h channel , while the pairing correlations are generated by a surface peaked density - dependent zero - range force @xmath10 in definition ( [ pair ] ) , @xmath11 is the particle density in coordinate space , @xmath12 is equal to the nuclear saturation density , the strength @xmath13 is a parameter fixed to reproduce the odd - even mass difference of nuclei in the studied region . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss how to make the choice of the parameter @xmath13 . in order to avoid divergences ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce a cut - off in the single - particle space .",
    "this cut - off limits the active pairing space above the fermi level . as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have used the smooth cut - off by multiplying the p - p matrix elements with cut - off factors @xmath14 taken as @xmath15 @xmath16 are the single - particle energies , @xmath17 is the chemical potential . in our calculations",
    "we have set the energy cut - off @xmath18 equal to 10 mev above the fermi level , the width parameter @xmath19 being 0.5  mev .",
    "the residual interaction @xmath20 in the p - h channel and @xmath21 in the p - p channel can be obtained as the second derivatives of the energy density functional with respect to the particle density @xmath22 and the pair density @xmath23 , respectively . following the method introduced in @xcite we",
    "simplify @xmath20 by approximating it by its landau - migdal form . for skyrme interactions the landau parameters are functions of the coordinate @xmath24 and",
    "all parameters with @xmath25 vanish .",
    "we keep only the @xmath26 terms in @xmath20 and the expressions for @xmath27 in terms of the skyrme force parameters can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we study only normal parity states and one can neglect the spin - spin terms since they play a minor role .",
    "the coulomb and spin - orbit residual interactions are also dropped .",
    "therefore we can write the residual interaction in the following form : @xmath28 \\delta ( { \\bf r}_1 - { \\bf r}_2 ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the channel index @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the isospin operator , and @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 standing for the fermi momentum and nucleon effective mass . for the p - p channel the expressions for @xmath35 and @xmath36 have the following forms : @xmath37 @xmath38 as a matter of fact",
    ", the definition of the pairing force  ( [ pair ] ) involves the energy cut - off of the single - particle space to restrict the active pairing space within the mean - field approximation .",
    "this energy cut - off is still required to eliminate the p - p matrix elements of the residual interaction in the case of the subshells that are far from the fermi level .",
    "the region of influence of the residual p - p interaction is confined to the bcs subspace @xmath39 where all subshells below the energy cut - off are included .",
    "the two - body matrix elements @xmath40 can be written as :    @xmath41    @xmath42    in the p - h and p - p channels , respectively . in the above expressions , @xmath43",
    ", @xmath44 is the reduced matrix element of the spherical harmonics @xmath45  @xcite , @xmath46 is the radial integral : @xmath47 where the radial wave functions @xmath48 are related to the single - particle wave functions : @xmath49 we see that the p - h matrix elements are in the separable form in the angular coordinates .",
    "the separability of the antisymmetrized p - p matrix elements is proved in appendix  a. the radial integrals  ( [ i ] ) can be calculated accurately by choosing a large enough cut - off radius @xmath50 and using a @xmath51-point integration gauss formula with abscissas @xmath52 and weights @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the residual interaction can be reduced to a finite rank separable form : @xmath54 we sum over the proton(@xmath55 ) and neutron(@xmath56 ) indexes and the notation @xmath57 is used .",
    "a change @xmath58 means a change @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) are the multipole interaction strengths in the p - h ( p - p ) channel and they can be expressed as : @xmath62 the multipole operators entering the normal products in eq.([mult ] ) are defined as follows : @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the single - particle matrix elements of the multipole operators : @xmath66 the residual interaction ( [ mult ] ) is represented in terms of bi - fermion quasiparticle operators and their conjugates : @xmath67 @xmath68 thus , the hamiltonian of our method has the same form as the hamiltonian of the qpm  @xcite , but the single - quasiparticle spectrum and the parameters of the residual interaction are calculated with the skyrme forces .",
    "we introduce the phonon creation operators @xmath69 where the index @xmath70 denotes total angular momentum and @xmath71 is its z - projection in the laboratory system .",

    "it is shown that the matrix dimensions never exceed @xmath85 independently of the configuration space size .",
    "if we omit the residual interaction in the p - p channel then the matrix dimension is reduced by a factor 3 @xcite .",
    "we apply our approach to study characteristics of the lowest vibrational states in the nuclei around the @xmath5sn region . in this work we use the parametrization sly4  @xcite of the skyrme interaction .",
    "one peculiarity is that the parameters of the force have been adjusted to describe the pure neutron matter .",
    "it follows that this parametrization is a good candidate to describe isotopic properties of nuclei from the @xmath86-stability line to the neutron drip line . in our calculations",
    "the single - particle continuum is discretized  @xcite by diagonalizing the hf hamiltonian on a basis of twelve harmonic oscillator shells and cutting off the single - particle spectra at the energy of 100 mev .",
    "this is sufficient to exhaust practically all the energy - weighted sum rule within the qrpa .",
    "we use the isospin - invariant surface - peaked pairing force  ( [ pair ] ) . the value @xmath87= 0.16fm  @xmath88 is the nuclear saturation density for the sly4 force . the pairing strength @xmath13 is fitted to reproduce the pairing energies given by @xmath89 for neutrons , and similarly for protons . the strength @xmath13 is taken equal to -940 mev@xmath90 in order to get a reasonable description of the energies  ( [ p ] ) for both protons and neutrons .",
    "the landau parameters @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 expressed in terms of the skyrme force parameters @xcite depend on @xmath33 .",
    "as it is pointed out in our previous works @xcite one needs to adopt some effective value for @xmath33 to give an accurate representation of the original p - h skyrme interaction . for the present calculations we use the nuclear matter value for @xmath33 .",
    "our previous investigations @xcite enable us to conclude that @xmath51=45 for the rank of our separable approximation is enough for multipolarities @xmath95 in nuclei with @xmath96 .",
    "it is worth to mention the significance of the energy cut - off of the single - particle space to confine the active space of the residual p - p interaction .",
    "our choice for the cut - off eliminates matrix elements  ( [ ppres ] ) coupling single - particle states inside and outside of the bcs subspace .",
    "as it is seen from table i omitting the energy cut - off would lead to an overestimation of the effect of the residual p - p interaction on the @xmath6 energy and @xmath97 in @xmath1te , for example .",

    "as the first application of the method we investigate the p - p channel effects on energies and transition probabilities of @xmath6 states in @xmath2sn . results of our calculations for the @xmath6 energies and @xmath101 transition probabilities are compared with experimental data @xcite in fig.1 . as it is seen from fig.1",
    "there is a remarkable increase of the @xmath6 energy and @xmath97 in @xmath5sn in comparison with those in @xmath102sn .",
    "as it was explained in our previous paper @xcite such a behaviour of @xmath97 is related with the proportion between the qrpa amplitudes for neutrons and protons in sn isotopes . including the p - p channel changes contributions of the main configurations only slightly , but",
    "the general structure of the @xmath6 remains the same .",
    "the neutron amplitudes are dominant in all sn isotopes and the contribution of the main neutron configuration @xmath103 increases from 58% ( 61% in the case of the inclusion the p - h interaction only ) in @xmath104sn to 85.6% ( 85.3% for the p - h case ) in @xmath1sn when neutrons fill the subshell @xmath105 . at the same time the contribution of the main proton configuration @xmath106 is decreasing from 15% in @xmath104sn to 7% in @xmath1sn .",
    "the closure of the neutron subshell @xmath105 in @xmath5sn leads to the vanishing of the neutron pairing .",
    "the energy of the first neutron two - quasiparticle pole @xmath107 in @xmath5sn is larger than energies of the first poles in @xmath102sn and the contribution of the @xmath107 configuration in the doubly magic @xmath5sn is about 61% .",
    "furthermore , the first pole in @xmath5sn is closer to the proton poles .",
    "this means that the contribution of the proton two - quasiparticle configurations is larger than those in the neighbouring isotopes and as a result the main proton configuration @xmath106 in @xmath5sn exhausts about 33% . in @xmath108sn",
    "the leading contribution ( about 96% ) comes from the neutron configuration @xmath109 and as consequently the @xmath101 value is reduced .",
    "such a behaviour of the @xmath6 energies and @xmath101 values in the neutron - rich sn isotopes reflects the shell structure in this region . as one can see from fig.1 the inclusion of the p - p channel results in a reduction of energies and transition probabilities .",
    "the calculations reproduce very well a general behaviour for energies and transition probabilities , but there is some overestimation in comparison with experimental data .",
    "one can expect an improvement if the coupling with the two - phonon components of the wave functions @xcite is taken into account .",
    "such calculations are now in progress .",
    "it is worth to mention that the first prediction of the anomalous behaviour of @xmath110 excitations around @xmath5sn based on the qrpa calculations with a separable quadrupole - plus - pairing hamiltonian has been done in @xcite .",
    "other qrpa calculations with skyrme @xcite and gogny @xcite forces give similar results for sn isotopes .",

    "the calculated @xmath6 state energies and transition probabilities b(e2 ) in the @xmath3te isotopes and experimental data @xcite are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the general behaviour of energies of the te isotopes is similar to that of the sn isotopes .",
    "they have a maximal value at n=82 , but the behaviour of the b(e2)-values is different and corresponds to a standard evolution of the @xmath101 near closed shells . as it is seen from fig.2",
    "there is a decrease of the @xmath6 energies due to the inclusion of the p - p channel . at the same time",
    "the @xmath101-values do not change practically .",
    "it means that the collectivity of the @xmath6 states is reduced .",
    "the neutron configurations exhaust about 17% and 28% of the wave function normalization in @xmath5te and @xmath4te respectively . in @xmath108te",
    "the contribution of the neutron configurations is less than 3% and the dominant proton configuration @xmath111 gives a contribution of about 65% that is almost twice larger than in the neighboring te isotopes .",
    "as far as a contribution of this configuration into the transition probability is less than contributions of other proton configurations the @xmath101-values have such a behaviour near n=82 .",
    "the structure of the @xmath6 in @xmath5te is similar to that in @xmath4te and as a result the @xmath101-values differ slightly .",
    "our calculations describe correctly the isotopic dependence of energies and transition probabilities and they are in a reasonable agreement with the available experimental data .",
    "it is worth to mention that the anharmonicity effects are strong for the light te isotopes and the qrpa is not very good in such a case .",
    "the @xmath101-value in the neutron - rich isotope @xmath4te is only slightly larger than that of @xmath108te , in contrast to the trend of ce , ba and xe isotopes @xcite .",
