    "a bayesian net ( bn ) is a directed acyclic graph ( probabilistic expert system ) in which every node represents a random variable with a discrete or continuous state @xcite . + the relationships among variables , pointed out by arcs , are interpreted in terms of conditional probabilities according to bayes theorem .",
    "+ with the bn is implemented the concept of conditional independence that allows the factorization of the joint probability , through the markov property , in a series of local terms that describe the relationships among variables :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 denotes the states of the predecessors ( parents ) of the variable @xmath2 ( child ) @xcite .",
    "this factorization enable us to study the network locally .",
    "+ a bayesian network requires an appropriate database to extract the conditional probabilities ( parameter learning problem ) and the network structure ( structural learning problem ) @xcite .",
    "+ the objective is to find the net that best approximates the joint probabilities and the dependencies among variables .",
    "+ after we have constructed the network one of the common goal of bayesian network is the probabilistic inference to estimate the state probabilities of nodes given the knowledge of the values of others nodes .",
    "the inference can be done from children to parents ( this is called diagnosis ) or vice versa from parents to children ( this is called prediction ) @xcite .",
    "+ however in many cases the data are not available because the examined events can be new , rare , complex or little understood . in such conditions",
    "experts opinions are used for collecting information that will be translated in conditional probability values or in a certain joint or prior distribution ( probability elicitation ) @xcite .",
    "+ such problems are more evident in the case in which the expert is requested to define too many conditional probabilities due to the number of the variable s parents .",
    "so , when possible , is worthwhile to reduce the number of probabilities to be specified by assuming some relationships that impose bonds on the interactions between parents and children as for example the noisy - or and its variation and genralization @xcite .",
    "+ in the business field , bayesian nets are a useful tool for a multivariate and integrated analysis of the risks , for their monitoring and for the evaluation of intervention strategies ( by decision graph ) for their mitigation @xcite . + enterprise risk can be defined as the possibility that something with an impact on the objectives happens , and it is measured in terms of combination of probability of an event ( frequency ) and of its consequence ( impact ) . + the enterprise risk assessment is a part of enterprise risk management ( erm ) where to estimate the frequency and the impact distributions historical data as well as expert opinions are typically used @xcite . then such distributions are combined to get the loss distribution .",
    "+ in this context bayesian nets are a useful tool to integrate historical data with those coming from experts which can be qualitative or quantitative @xcite .",
    "what we present in this work is the construction of a bayesian net for having an integrated view of the risks involved in the building of an important structure in italy , where the risk frequencies and impacts were collected by an erm procedure unsing expert opinions .",
    "+ we have constructed the network by using an already existing database ( db ) where the available information are the risks with their frequencies , impacts and correlation among them . in total",
    "there are about 300 risks .",
    "+ in our work we have considered only the frequencies of risks and no impacts . with our bn",
    "we construct the risks joint probability and the impacts could be used in a later phase of scenario analysis to evaluate the loss distribution under the different scenarios @xcite .",
    "+ in table 1 there is the db structure used for network learing and in which each risk is considered as a binary variable ( one if the risk exists _ ( yes ) _ and zero if the risk dosent exist _ ( not ) _ ) .",
    "therefore , for each considered risk in the network there will be one node with two states ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "the task is , therefore , to find the conditional probabilities tables by using only the correlations and the marginal frequencies . instead",
    ", the net structure is obtained from table 1 by following the node relationships given by correlations .",
    "+ the main ideas for finding a way to construct a bn have been : first to find the joint probabilities as functions of only the correlations and the marginal probabilities ; second to understand how the correlations are linked with the incremental ratios or the derivatives of the child s probabilities as functions of the parent s probabilities .",
    "this choice is due to the fact that parent and child interact through the values of conditional probabilities ; the derivatives are directly linked to such probabilities and , therefore , to the degree of interaction between the two nodes and , hence with the correlation .",
    "+ afterwards we have understood as to create equations , for the case with dependent parents we have used the local network topology to set the equations .",
    "+ we have been able to calculate the cpt up to three parents for each child .",
    "although there is the possibility to generalize to more than three parents , it is necessary to have more data which are not available in our db .",
    "so when four or more parents are present we have decided to divide and reduce to cases with no more than three parents . to approximate the network",
    "we have `` separated '' the nodes that give the same effects on the child ( as for example the same correlations ) by using auxiliary nodes @xcite . when there was more than one possible scheme available we have used the mutual information ( mi ) criterion as a discriminating index by selecting the approximation with the highest total mi ; this is the same to choose the structure with the minimum distance between the network and the target distribution @xcite .",
    "+ we have analyzed first the case with only one parent to understand the framework , then it has been seen what happens with two independent parents and then dependent .",
    "finally we have used the analogies between the cases with one and two parents for setting the equations for three parents .      the case with one parent ( figure 1 ) is the simplest .",
    "let p(f ) and p(c ) be the marginal probability given from expert ( as in table 1 ) :    * for the parent , f , we have : p(f = y)=x , p(f = n)=1-x ; * for the child , c , we have : p(c = y)=y , p(c = n)=1-y ;    one parent scheme ]    the equations to find either the conditional probabilities or the joint probabilities are :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "so far we have seen that using the equation systems for conditional and joint probabilities the cpts can be obtained .",
    "the method can be generalized to the case with more three parents , but there are problems in setting more parameters ( standardized joint moment ) and in looking for more complicated feasible marginal correlation areas .",
    "+ so to develop a network we propose to use , separately , firstly the equations and procedure for the one parent ; secondly those for two parents distinguishing when they are dependent and not .",
    "finally we use the equations and the procedures , when possible , for the three parents case by distinguishing also in this situation between dependent and independent parents ; otherwise we split one parent from the others by using the mutual information as splitting index @xcite .",
    "+ we remark that we need to reduce to a more simple case those configurations with more than three parents .",
    "we can achieve this trying to estimate a local approximate structure , with only one , two and three parents , by `` separating '' those that give different effects on the child ( as for instance different incremental ratios ) . if there are more schemes available for the substitution we select that with the highest mi ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "+ it is important to be noted that such method is modular , this is if we add or delete a node we can use the appropiate system ( one , two or three nodes ) to according to we add or delete a parent or a child .",
