    "in many social media , people consume and give feedback on items .",
    "for example , on last.fm , people express their preferences for songs by _ listening _ to or _",
    "loving _ them .",
    "these actions are shared to their friends or followers through an activity feed that aggregates the actions of a user s friends .",
    "a fundamental question in these online social networks is how friends influence people s preferences and decisions .",
    "such influence operates through many mechanisms , including social proof , conformity , mimicry , and personal liking ( see @xcite for a review ) and can affect our consumption of information @xcite , preferences for cultural items @xcite , adoption of new products @xcite , behaviors around health @xcite , and even decisions to vote @xcite .",
    "influence has also captured the popular imagination , as a powerful force that makes content spread _ virally _ through a social network @xcite . measuring the extent of this influence",
    ", then , is an important problem in understanding diffusion in social networks .",
    "in general , observational data from social networks , both offline and online , do show correlation in friends activities , or _",
    "locality _ in their preferences within a social network @xcite .",
    "studies in twitter @xcite , wikipedia @xcite , flickr @xcite , and second life @xcite consistently find that a user s probability of adopting an item increases with the number of friends who have done so before .",
    "however , this locality may not be due to social influence because other social processes might also lead to the same correlation .",
    "notably , people are more likely to form social ties with people who are similar to them , via the homophily selection process @xcite .",
    "thus , even in the absence of any social influence , underlying similarity between people may lead to observed similarities in their preferences on items that could lead to overestimates of social influence .    untangling",
    "this knot is a problem that has vexed sociologists for decades . in general , without either strong assumptions about influence mechanisms ( e.g. , @xcite ) or strong knowledge of latent variables that indicate homophily ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a structural analysis of the causal graphical model @xcite encoding influence and homophily shows that distinguishing them is impossible @xcite .    in this paper , we make principled assumptions about both the influence mechanism and indicators of homophily to develop a method for identifying influence that is well - suited for continuous activity data from online social networks .",
    "since activity feeds are a primary interface element in most social networks that expose people to their friends updates @xcite and facilitate social learning @xcite , we look specifically at how influence might flow through these feeds .",
    "that is , we study whether exposure to friends activities through an aggregated feed makes a user more likely to copy or mimic them ; we call this mechanism _ copy - influence _ due to the feed . for indicators of homophily , instead of using demographic or other latent attributes as in aral et al",
    ". @xcite , we directly use people s decisions on items to model their underlying preferences , and look at whether people copy friends actions more than we would expect based on their underlying preferences .",
    "that is , if a user sees that her friend on last.fm loved a song , does it make her more likely to love it as well ? or would she have loved it anyways ?",
    "our method is based on the observation that feeds rarely show activity of non - friends to a user .",
    "thus , comparing how often a user copies actions from her friends feed to how often she copies actions from a simulated feed constructed from actions of a matched set of non - friends with preferences similar to her friends provides a statistical procedure for estimating influence .",
    "we first show that this procedure distinguishes copy - influence from preference similarity using semi - synthetic data based on a dataset we collected from last.fm .",
    "we then apply it to real activity data from last.fm , goodreads , flixster , and flickr .",
    "our results on this broad range of websites and item domains reveal three main takeaways about the role of copy - influence in online social networks .",
    "first , we find that naive estimates of copy - influence do overestimate it , often substantially , and that the degree of overestimation varies widely across datasets and kinds of actions .",
    "we argue that this variation is likely due to differences between sharing networks in characteristics such as the ease of consumption of items , the specific design of the feed , and its role in people s use of a site .",
    "second , we find wide individual variation in susceptibility to copy - influence .",
    "such variation extends past work on identifying differences in susceptibility @xcite , and points to the potential of using individual - level susceptibility estimates for modeling diffusion and making more informative , persuasive recommendations using social information @xcite .",
    "third , we find that the extent of copy - influence is small . across all domains ,",
    "less than 1% of people s actions can be attributed to copy - influence .",
    "contrary to the popular narrative on influence , our results join other work in questioning the extent of influence or virality in these networks @xcite , at least as conveyed through copying others observed behaviors in activity feeds",
    ".    this paper also contributes a way to estimate copy - influence in any network where network connections and timestamped activity data are visible , as well as a large last.fm dataset .",
    "more generally , we see this work as demonstrating the need for sharper definitions of influence that account for both personal preferences and specific mechanisms of influence .",
    "mimicry of others actions has been demonstrated in controlled experiments .",
    "this can happen at a population level , as with sagalnik et al.s demonstration that making popularity visible causes different songs to become popular compared to the case when no such information is shown @xcite",
    ". it may be even stronger at the individual level ; sharma and cosley showed that trusted friends opinions have more influence on people s willingness to try unknown items than item popularity @xcite .",
    "similar results have been shown in experiments on online social networks : a user is more likely to share a link on facebook if it appears in her social feed @xcite and to click on an ad if it is endorsed by her friends @xcite .    outside of controlled experiments around information consumption in real social networks  which may be infeasible , costly , or potentially unethical ",
    "identification of influence is not straightforward .",
    "naive measures such as simply counting the number of common actions between friends within a given time period likely overestimate influence @xcite , as any observed data is simultaneously affected by both influence and homophily . in addition , people may be _ externally exposed _ to the same item through forces outside of the social network @xcite .",
    "for example , two friends may like the same item after watching an advertisement for it .",
    "such external exposure also creates confounds for estimating influence .    in line with shalizi and",
    "thomas argument for the need for assumptions about mechanism @xcite , work on estimating influence from observational data generally makes assumptions about the nature of influence and/or homophily , then uses statistical or computational procedures on those data to simulate contexts where those assumptions do nt hold .",
    "the first general strategy is to compare the observed data with an alternative world with no influence and attribute the differences to influence .",
    "a core part of such an estimation procedure is to obtain , or create , data and network structures for the alternative world .",
    "christakis et al . presented an edge - reversal test , where if person a has an edge to b but not vice - versa , then comparing b s influence on a with that of a on b would give us a measure of influence due to the directed edge @xcite .",
    "this is based on the intuition that influence should flow only one way on directed edges ; it also has the advantage of strongly addressing the effect of homophily .",
    "this test was used to examine whether becoming obese is contagious and found that influence is significantly higher in the direction of the directed edge than the opposite direction . in online contexts like twitter with asymmetric",
    "information flows , this could fit well , but in networks with undirected edges , it is not so useful .",
    "another approach by anagnostopoulos et al . randomizes the order of people s actions to remove causal links due to temporality between a s and b s actions @xcite . in the absence of influence",
    ", the expected probability of a user acting upon an item given that some number of their friends have already done so ",
    "called @xmath1-exposure @xcite  should be the same in the observed data and the time - shuffled data .",
    "if it is statistically different , influence is in play .",
    "the method was used on a flickr dataset and showed no significant difference between the two worlds .",
    "still , the authors do not rule out influence , giving examples from their dataset that demonstrate influence effects , and note that their method is unable to make individual - level influence estimates .      instead of removing influence ,",
    "the other main strategy is to control for homophily .",
    "for instance , la fond and neville use shuffling of social network edges to estimate influence given snapshots of people s network and activity data at two points in time @xcite .",
    "they first calculate the average overlap in activity between friends .",
    "to control for homophily , they subtract the overlap in friends activity after randomizing the edges between people . to control for external exposure",
    ", they also subtract out the overlap among friends when both edges and actions are randomized .",
    "any difference that one finds then , must be due to influence .",
    "using data on facebook groups joined by people at two timestamps a year apart , they found that the relative effect of influence varies : some groups exhibited a significant influence effect , while others exhibited a significant homophily effect .",
    "another way to control for homophily is to directly account for its indicators .",
    "if we are able to observe attributes such as demographics or other characteristics that affect people s preferences , then we can identify influence by controlling for these attributes .",
    "based on this intuition , aral et al .",
    "estimated influence effects by comparing adoption rates for pairs of similar users where only one of them had a friend who had adopted the item @xcite . using data from yahoo on adoption of a web service and 46 attributes based on personal and network characteristics",
    ", they found that most adoption was independent of influence .",
    "a fundamental problem , however , is that their method depends heavily on the careful choice and availability of attributes that predict similarity .",
    "combining ideas from the above two lines of work , we propose a broadly applicable statistical procedure for estimating the extent of copy - influence in social networks .",
    "we control for homophily using activity data while limiting the time duration of exposure to friends actions to closely model the mechanism of copy - influence through a feed interface . in this , we make the following key assumptions .      to control for homophily , we borrow from the recommender systems literature @xcite and assume that similarity metrics based on past activity are good indicators of underlying homophily .",
    "past activity data implicitly captures factors such as demographics , prior external and social influence , and other hidden factors that determine people s preferences on items @xcite ; it can also be a direct indicator of their current personal preference . in principle , any two people with identical activity histories have the same probability of acting on an item in the future , minus any social influence .",
    "using commonly available streams of activity data avoids cost and methodological issues around using panel data collected at fixed intervals @xcite and allows broader application of the matching technique from aral et al .",
    "@xcite , which required additional person - level and network attributes .      to specify the influence mechanism , we focus on copy - influence from feeds .",
    "feeds are not the only interface elements that might convey social influence : profile pages , collaborative filtering or popularity - based lists of items , social explanations of presented content , and out - of - system interaction may all convey information and perhaps influence from friends .",
    "however , feeds are ubiquitous and commonly studied as conveyors of influence @xcite ; we argue that they are the dominant feature through which people see and learn from their friends behavior in social networks @xcite , and thus a dominant feature through which influence from specific friends might flow .",
    "[ fig : lastfm - interface ]    further , we assume that the feeds show an unfiltered , reverse chronological aggregation of friends activities . for many networks such as last.fm , goodreads , and flickr ,",
    "this closely resembles the feed seen by users .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : lastfm - interface ] shows a reverse chronological feed of songs loved by the friends of a user on last.fm .",
    "still , this is an approximation : feeds can contain advertisements or content from non - friends ( e.g. , sometimes facebook presents actions from friends of friends ) , while algorithmic filtering can hide or reorder items shown in the feed .",
    "we discuss ways to deal with such filtered feeds later .",
    "the above assumptions lead to a simple model for users interaction with an activity feed .",
    "let us start by formally defining what we mean by a _ feed _ within a social network .",
    "the term _ friend _ refers to anyone whose activities are shown to the user ; these are typically social connections of an individual , such as facebook friends or twitter followees .",
    "we define the feed to be the aggregated activity of all of a user @xmath2 s friends presented in reverse chronological order .",
    "we assume that at the time a user performs an action , she has seen some number @xmath3 of the friends most recent actions in the feed .",
    "in contrast to k - exposure models that implicitly assume people attend to all of their friends actions @xcite , the parameter @xmath3 represents a user s attention budget for friends actions and we argue this more realistically models copy - influence .    finally , we define _ copy - actions _ as actions by a user on itmes that appear in the last @xmath3 items in her feed ( e.g. , loving one of the songs in figure  [ fig : lastfm - interface ] if @xmath4 ) .",
    "a baseline measure of copy - influence would be the fraction of actions by a user that are copy - actions , as reported in some studies @xcite .",
    "however , as argued earlier , that is likely to overestimate copy - influence because of underlying homophily and external exposure .",
    "to address these possible confounds , let us now consider a hypothetical feed constructed from users who are not friends with the user . when a user s actions are copies of a feed based on non - friends , that is most likely due to following their own preferences or common external exposure .",
    "copy - influence is ruled out because within our model , a user does not see the non - friends actions in her feed .",
    "this intuition drives our procedure for estimating copy - influence : if we can find non - friends who are as similar to a user as that user s friends , we may use them to approximate the effects of homophily and some kinds of external exposure . thus , copy - influence can be estimated as the number of copy - actions from the friends feed , over and above the observed overlap between a user s actions and the matched non - friends feed .    to compute similarity between users , we consider their past actions on items as a representation of their preferences .",
    "this allows us to use similarity metrics on past actions to find non - friends who are as similar in preferences to a user as her actual friends .",
    "note that our selection of non - friends is similar to la fond and neville @xcite , except that instead of choosing non - friends randomly , we use preference similarity to better control for homophily .",
    "in addition to controlling for homophily , using matched non - friends also controls for some kinds of external exposure .",
    "these would include mass advertisements or widely popular items where any two users with the same personal preference would be expected to have an equal probability of acting on the item , regardless of the distance between them in the network .",
    "the procedure proceeds in two phases : _ matching _ and _ estimation_. we divide the data into two parts at a fixed time @xmath5 , performing the matching phase on data before @xmath5 and the estimation phase on data after @xmath5 . in the matching phase , for each user @xmath2",
    "we generate a set of non - friends (  similar strangers \" ) who at time @xmath5 are as close in preferences to the user as her friends . in the estimation phase ,",
    "we compute friends - overlap , the fraction of @xmath2 s actions that are copy - actions of a feed based on friends ( @xmath6 ) , and strangers - overlap , the fraction that are copy - actions of a feed based on the similar strangers ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the extent by which friends - overlap  is greater than strangers - overlap  gives us a measure of copy - influence .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > \" , ]",
    "we have focused so far on last.fm as a running example for explaining and exploring the pme procedure .",
    "we now apply it to compute copy - influence estimates on other social networks and see how our results generalize to different item domains , feed interfaces , and system designs .",
    "table  [ tab : desc - others ] presents aggregate data for three existing datasets we use from goodreads @xcite , flixster @xcite , and flickr @xcite .",
    "these datasets cover a diverse set of item domains : goodreads is a social network for books , flixster for movies , and flickr for photos .",
    "more details about each dataset can be found in the papers that introduced them @xcite .",
    "as on last.fm , users on each of these websites can act upon items and form undirected connections with other users .",
    "goodreads and flixster allow users to _ rate _ books and movies respectively .",
    "flickr allows users to _ favorite _ photos that other users post on the website .",
    "in addition , each social network has a feed interface that shows friends rating or favoriting activities , aggregated and presented in a loosely reverse chronologically order in the way our model of copy - influence assumes .",
    "the number of items available to act on among the three datasets varies widely . on average ,",
    "an item is acted on 3 times on flickr , 21 times on goodreads , and 163 times on flixster . for comparison ,",
    "the same average was 10 loves per song on last.fm ( in this section , we report only loves on last.fm because they are more similar to rating or favoriting actions in these websites ) .",
    "in contrast to per - item activity , per - user activity is similar across all three datasets , with users acting on over 100 items on average .    since on goodreads and flixster a friend s rating",
    "is shown in a user s feed irrespective of whether it was high or low , we consider all ratings by users for our analysis . since we do not know the real number of friends for each user in these datasets , we consider any user with non - zero friends as a core user .",
    "all friend relations are still without timestamps , so we assume a static social network and set @xmath5 for each dataset so that only @xmath8 of the actions are after time @xmath5 . for consistency",
    ", we use the same values for all other parameters as for last.fm .",
    "figure  [ fig : influence - low ] shows the friends - overlap  and copy - influence estimates for all four datasets , along with standard error .",
    "we find varying estimates for friends - overlap   on these datasets , from @xmath9 on flixster to @xmath10 on flickr .",
    "the amount of friends - overlap  explained by preference similarity also varies widely ; the copy - influence estimate is less than 15% of friends - overlap  for flixster and over 85% of friends - overlap  for flickr .",
    "such differences are plausible , and in fact , expected : except for the fact that they are all online social networks , these websites differ from each other in many characteristics : their item domains , types of actions , popularity of items , user interfaces , and use cases .    however , after controlling for preference similarity between friends , we find that the copy - influence estimates for all four domains fall into a range from 0.0020.007 .",
    "interpreting the copy - influence estimate as the average fraction of user actions due to copy - influence , these results imply that less than @xmath0 of the total user actions in these sites can be attributed to copy - influence from the feed .",
    "we present pme , a broadly applicable estimation procedure for separating social influence from preference behavior in online social networks . unlike past work on identifying influence @xcite",
    ", our procedure does not need any additional person - level attributes , relies on data that is often publicly available , does not depend on the directionality of edges , and provides both overall and person - level estimates of not just the presence but the amount of copy - influence . applying this procedure to data from a broad range of websites shows that simple correlational estimates between friends greatly overestimate the extent of copy - influence and that accounting for preference similarity can lead to more accurate estimates .",
    "our results add depth to studies that found that a majority of actions common between friends can be attributed to homophily instead of influence @xcite , both showing that it occurs in a number of contexts and that the extent of overestimation varies widely with both users and systems .",
    "we begin by placing our results in context with scholarly work on diffusion and influence in online social networks , questioning whether the effects of copy - influence are overrated .",
    "we then discuss plausible reasons for differences in the overestimation of actual copy - influence that we saw for different social networks . finally , we revisit assumptions of the pme procedure  that should be kept in mind before using it in other settings .      our results indicate a subdued picture of the role of copy - influence in online sharing networks . in all four datasets , more than 99% of people s actions on items",
    "can be explained without copy - influence , and most users are not at all influenced by the activity feed . even without controlling for homophily , friends - overlap  an upper bound on the actual copy - influence  is low : less than 2% of users actions are copy - actions ( figure  [ fig : influence - low ] ) .",
    "these results are at odds with both popular perception and much scholarly work on social influence .",
    "the idea of a particular item or opinion starting from a few sources and spreading _ virally _ to a large component of a social network is riveting and often highlighted in popular discourse .",
    "further , social influence on online networks has been shown to be present for a number of activities , as we pointed out earlier .",
    "thus , we are not arguing that influence is not important .",
    "however , we do think that in many contexts it is likely overstated .",
    "in particular , our results call attention to the tiny role of copy - influence in affecting people s routine activity around items . most discussion of influence focuses on the unusual : events where people do adopt their friends behaviors and items spread widely . however , the mundane reality is that most people s actions are driven by their own preferences .",
    "recent empirical work on the spread of items through social media provide further support for this claim .",
    "flaxman et al .",
    "show that only about 2% of online news consumption is referred through social media @xcite .",
    "this is essentially an upper bound on the fraction of news articles read due to influence from others in a social network .",
    "this study , like our work , is able to put the effect of social media on news consumption in perspective by comparing it against the total number of news articles visited by users and not just focusing on the ones shared within social networks .",
    "likewise , the vast majority of tweets never breach the sender s ego network @xcite .    still ,",
    "a small effect today could turn into a big one tomorrow : @xmath0 of all actions seems tiny , but @xmath11 influenced action out of @xmath12 may aggregate over time to be a significant effect on people s decisions",
    ". this might be especially true if those influences happen earlier in a user s lifetime , which figure  [ fig : activity - susc ] suggests is true , since lower - activity users appear to have higher copy - influence estimates .",
    "studying the temporal variation in copy - influence estimates and evolution of people s personal preferences over time will be interesting future work .",
    "we also observe variations in the degree of over - estimation for copy - influence between different actions ( listen and love on last.fm ) and between different websites , and it will be useful to understand the reasons for these differences .",
    "we see two factors as playing a prominent role in affecting the potential influence of friends actions : characteristics of the item space and the design of the feed .",
    "our goal here is not to present an exhaustive account of reasons why copy - influence might differ between domains and individuals ( in particular , network factors such as tie strength and knowledge of friends also affect people s copying decisions @xcite ) , but instead to call attention to the need for nuance in thinking about the mechanisms by which influence flows .",
    "one set of factors that might affect the extent of copy - influence has to do with properties of the items and domain .    * the distribution of attention to items likely matters .",
    "for example , photos on flickr , being user - generated items , are numerous compared to relatively mass - consumed items such as movies , music , and books .",
    "this leads to the low mean popularity of @xmath13 for a photo that we see in table  [ tab : desc - others ] . consequently , the likelihood that people are exposed a particular photo through their friends rather than other mechanisms is higher .",
    "there could be a similar effect for explicit loves on last.fm , which are rarer than listens and signal stronger interest from others . *",
    "further , items like books , movies , and songs have a well - defined existence outside of the social networks we study that might lead to more external exposure . photos , on the other hand , often exist only on flickr and thus are hard to discover from outside the system itself . * finally , photos , like songs , are quick consumption items and thus are more amenable to mimicry on exposure from friends feeds than a book or a movie .",
    "a user may favorite a photo right after viewing it in her feed or love a song after listening to it for a few minutes . for domains like books or movies which take hours to consume , we would expect less such spontaneous mimicry .    these characteristics of",
    "the item space can affect both the amount of overlap in activity between friends and the actual copy - influence flowing between them .",
    "table  [ tab : compare - websites ] summarizes these factors for the four websites we studied .",
    "the column for flixster in the table suggests why movie ratings on flixster have low copy - influence : the dataset does not possess any of the three factors that promote the likelihood of copy - influence .",
    "on the other hand , flickr , where preference similarity could rule out only a small fraction of friends - overlap , satisfies all these criteria .",
    "last.fm and goodreads lie the middle .",
    "l@0.1inc@0.05inc@0.05inc@0.05inc * item properties * & * flickr * & * goodreads * & * last.fm * & * flixster * + no external existence & yes & no & no &",
    "no + sparse actions / item & yes & yes & yes &",
    "no + quick consumption & yes & no & yes & no +      these websites also differ in how they show friends activities to a user . since users are typically exposed to their friends activity through the feed , both the design of the feed interface and ranking algorithms that perturb the feed likely impact the extent of copy - influence in a network .",
    "figure  [ fig : lastfm - interface ] shows the feed for love actions on last.fm ; in the grand scheme of the interface , however , it is a small widget .",
    "moreover , the interface is often in the background while people listen to music and attend to other tasks , likely reducing the feed s influence relative to other sites .",
    "the interface for flickr lies on the other side of the spectrum : most of the available space is devoted to a feed of others photos , so using the interface is a focal activity that concentrates attention on the photos shown in the feed",
    ".    feeds might also make acting on an item possible without having to consume it .",
    "for instance , a user might not read a book or watch a movie right away , but if the interface lets her put it in a queue , this might reasonably be considered copy - influence on the _ queuing _ action . note that in this case , the design of the feed and the actions afforded to users compensates for the item property of slow consumption .",
    "this discussion underscores the importance of precise definitions and explicit mechanisms for interpreting the influence estimates we obtain .",
    "system design and characteristics of the item space both impact people s exposure to and ability to act on items from their friends , thus impacting what we _ measure _ as copy - influence in these social networks .",
    "even though the pme procedure  is broadly applicable to social networks  requiring only social network edges and timestamped preference data  it is important to interpret the resultant influence estimates with respect to the design and context of the specific network .",
    "we now return to the assumptions behind the pme procedure  and discuss how it may be adapted to estimate copy - influence from feeds in other social networks . in particular , we assume limited attention to a reverse chronological feed , focus only on influence conveyed by the feed , consider similarity in actions as a proxy for homophily , assume a static network , and equally weight activites by all of a user s friends .",
    "although the feed interfaces of the four websites differ somewhat , at heart they are based on a reverse chronological feed , leading to our assumption of such a feed , cut off by a threshold @xmath3 number of actions that users attend to . when applying the influence estimation procedure to a new website , it is important to think about whether the specific feed ranking and interface of a website are amenable to such a formulation .",
    "for example , the reverse chronological assumption is less appropriate for networks with opaque feed ranking algorithms such as facebook . in such cases",
    "it would be important to capture data about which items are actually shown to a user or use knowledge about the algorithm to approximate the real feed from the timestamped activity data .",
    "in addition , future work on estimating personalized values of @xmath3 for each user might lead to more fine - grained estimates of susceptibility and copy - influence .",
    "our definition of copy - influence means that we are only capturing kinds of influence that directly lead to the consumption of an item shortly after being exposed to it by a friend . in the context of narratives around information diffusion and virality ,",
    "it is a reasonable choice : to propagate through the network , users must continue to interact with it in ways their friends will see ( and copy ) .",
    "further , we argue that this definition , by providing a concrete mechanism and measure for specific aspects of influence , is useful for carving the broad notion of `` influence '' into pieces that support better modeling , theorizing , and design .",
    "but it does mean that we are not talking about all mechanisms or methods of influence .",
    "focusing on the feed means we are not studying influence that flows through other interface features ; focusing on copying of specific actions means that we are not looking at indirect or cumulative notions of influence ( e.g. , k - exposure models ) .",
    "thus , it is important to remember that although the pme procedure  does its job in identifying copy - influence and shows the importance of personal preferences , it does not capture all aspects of influence in a system .",
    "we use preference similarity as a proxy for modeling underlying homophily between people . to do this",
    ", one needs to have sufficient data to make reasonable preference models ; this appears to be the case in many online social networks in which users generate large volumes of activity . since the effectiveness of the pme procedure hinges on the ability to match non - friends to friends , larger networks , higher activity levels , and context - appropriate metrics of similarity are likely to improve the reliability of copy - influence estimates .",
    "we also chose to account for personal preference by matching friends with non - friends .",
    "a natural alternative would be to directly compute a user s affinity for an item ( e.g. , using a recommendation algorithm @xcite ) and use that to control for a user s own preference .",
    "however , the drawback is that the interpretation of influence estimates would depend strongly on the quality of the recommender algorithm as a proxy for personal preference , while such a recommender would not be able to account for external influences that might be evident in other users activities .",
    "the datasets we studied did nt have timestamps for tie formation , so we assumed a static social network .",
    "when timestamps for edge formation are available , we can make a simple modification in the procedure to consider only people who became friends before time @xmath5 when computing the set of similar strangers , then considering the current friends of a user when computing friends - overlap .",
    "another limitation of our estimation procedure is that by considering all actions in the matching phase ( before time @xmath5 ) as proxy for personal preference , we miss out on the effects of copy - influence in those actions .",
    "if copy - influence is higher early on , we might underestimate it , as to the pme procedure  the effects of early copy - influence would look like personal preference at time @xmath5 .",
    "models that relax the time @xmath5 assumption and compute both preferences and friend sets across the history of the dataset are computationally expensive , but possible  and would be interesting for bringing simulation - based results around contagion and network change @xcite toward real datasets .",
    "further , better understanding how users susceptibility changes as a function of their time in the system and their networks is an interesting question in its own right .      finally , by comparing all friends of a user in aggregate with their matched non - friends , we do not consider possible differences in how much copy - influence",
    "a particualr friend might wield .",
    "past studies show that people perceive actions by different friends differently based on their relationship with them @xcite . in our current datasets",
    ", we did not have any principled ways to estimate tie strength .",
    "future work would include accounting for these tie - specific variations in influence .",
    "we presented a statistical procedure for separating copy - influence from behavior rooted in personal preferences in observational data .",
    "the procedure requires only activity and network data for users , thus making it well - suited for many online social networks .",
    "at least for the websites we studied , applying the influence - estimation procedure shows that the vast majority of people s actions on items in social networks can be explained without invoking copy - influence .    more generally , our results suggest the importance of having clear definitions of influence and well - defined behavior and process models . rather than a grand unifying theory of all influence ,",
    "we believe that focusing on specific processes are more likely to be useful in producing deeper understanding and models of influence .",
    "our results further suggest that past user activity can be a valuable resource for these models , requiring minimal additional data about users while giving valuable information about their underlying preferences .",
    "accurate estimates of influence , in turn , promise to improve both models of behavior and design for online social networks .",
    "individual - level estimates can lead to better models of susceptibility for diffusion models and better prediction of next actions of users for personalization tasks .",
    "they would also enable evaluation of changes to feeds and interfaces and be practically useful for improving user experiences on online social networks .",
