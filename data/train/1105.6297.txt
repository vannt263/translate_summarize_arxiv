    "@xmath29 is bound to depend implicitly on the temperature and can only be determined by numerical fitting with the experimental data .    in order to gain more insight into the dynamical properties of an eit medium at finite temperatures , it is desirable to take the atom s motion into account by statistical approach .",

    "the central idea of this work is to treat the atom as a stationary object but otherwise introduce some temperature - dependent parameters which are responsible for the manifestation of thermal effects .",

    "realistically , the atoms move freely with a velocity distribution obeying the maxwell - boltzmann statistics at finite temperatures . to reconcile these two contradictory situations , eqs.(@xmath26)-(@xmath63 ) should be understood as the motion equations seen by any observer fixed on the moving atoms . to incorporate the doppler shift into eq.(@xmath64 ) in an uncomplicated way",
