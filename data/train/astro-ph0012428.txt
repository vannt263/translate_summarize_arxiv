    "the pc - scale radio morphology derived from vlbi observations can be used to evaluate the effects of doppler boosting , that is likely to play a role in sources dominated by a single , unresolved component , in which a combination of opacity effects and speed of the plasma flow might produce peaked radio spectra ( see snellen @xcite , snellen et al .",
    "sources with their radio axis close to the plane of the sky instead are characterised by a weak core accounting for a small fraction of the total flux density .    in the framework of individual , powerful radio @xmath0 growth , gps and",
    "then css radio sources are nowadays considered the early stages , as the radio emitting region grows and expands within the interstellar matter of host galaxy , before plunging into the intergalactic medium to originate the extended radio source population ( fanti et al .",
    "@xcite ; readhead et al.@xcite ; begelman @xcite ; snellen et al .",
    "their radio structure is dominated by jets , lobes and hot - spots , while the cores generally account for a relatively small fraction of the total flux density .",
    "the morphologies are reminiscent of the fr  ii radio galaxy class , and they also share the same radio power range .    it has been shown ( owsianik & conway @xcite ; owsianik at al .",
    "@xcite ) that in the small double lobed compact symmetric objects ( csos ) the projected separation speed of the outer edges ( hot - spots ) is about 0.2c , confirming this hypothesis .",
    "the dynamical age of sources of about 50 - 100 pc in size is of the order of @xmath1 yr .",
    "the estimates of the radiative ages of the small radio sources are consistent with the hypothesis that they are young ( murgia et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    there is a correlation between ( projected ) linear size and turnover frequency ( odea @xcite ) . as the radio source expands the turnover moves to lower frequencies as the result of a decreased energy density within the radio emitting region .",
    "the turnover in the radio spectrum is either due to synchrotron self - absorption within the small radio emitting regions or to free - free absorption in the ionised region surrounding the radio source . in some cases it is also possible that a combination of these two effects is required",
    ".    the samples of powerful css and gps radio sources studied so far ( e.g. fanti et al .",
    "@xcite ; stanghellini et al .",
    "@xcite ) list the brightest sources with turnover frequencies ranging from about 100 mhz to about 5 ghz .",
    "the same distribution in peak frequency can be found in the samples of somewhat less powerful objects by snellen et al .",
    "@xcite and marecki et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    a sample of objects with turnover frequencies above 5 ghz would represent @xmath2 and therefore @xmath3 radio sources .",
    "we call these sources `` high frequency peakers '' ( hfps ) .",
    "they are rarely found in css and gps samples since their spectral turnover occurring between a few and a few tens of ghz , generally makes them relatively weak at the frequencies where radio catalogues are available .",
    "this class of sources also plays an important role when considering the contribution of discrete sources to the cosmic microvawe backgorund ( cmb ) ( de zotti et al .",
    "the density and the power of the hfp sources have to be taken into serious account in space missions like map and planck aiming to produce high resolution and high sensitivity ( @xmath4 ) images of the cmb radiation .",
    "css and gps sources have convex radio spectra peaking at frequencies ranging from about hundred mhz to a few ghz ; we assume / define that hfps have similar spectral properties , with the peak occurring at a few ghz or higher frequencies .",
    "the availability of large areas covered by radio surveys , and the need of a spectral peak at high frequencies made the choice of the nvss ( condon et al .",
    "@xcite ) and of the 87 gb ( gregory et al .",
    "@xcite ) catalogues quite natural .",
    "we cross correlated the 87 gb catalogue at 4.9 ghz with the nvss catalogue at 1.4 ghz and selected the sources with inverted spectra , and in particular those with a slope steeper than @xmath50.5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we defined * two * samples of candidates : the `` * bright * '' sample , with sources brighter than 300 mjy at 5 ghz and covering nearly the whole area of the 87 gb ( declination between 0 and + 75@xmath7 ) , excluding objects with @xmath8 to avoid the galactic plane and ease the optical identification work ; the `` * faint * '' sample is restricted to the area covered by the first survey ( becker et al .",
    "@xcite ) as well , and limited to sources brighter than 50 mjy at 4.9 ghz .",
    "this work presents the `` bright '' sample , while a forthcoming paper ( stanghellini et al .",
    "@xcite ) will describe the `` faint '' sample .",
    "the search for candidates for the bright sample started with the 1795 sources from the 87 gb stronger than 300 mjy and in the region of the sky described above .",
    "we used a simple fortran program to make a cross correlation of the positions of these sources with the catalogue derived from the nvss .",
    "the error in the position for the sources in the 87 gb is much larger than that associated with the nvss , and is generally of the order of 10 - 15 arcseconds in both ra and dec .",
    "we considered positionally coincident the sources with difference in either coordinate ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) smaller than the largest between 45 arcsec and 3 times the error reported in the 87 gb catalogue .",
    "only 55 sources could not be identified ( 3.1% ) since they fall in areas not yet covered by our release of the nvss catalogue ( as of july , 1999 ) . among the remaining 1740 objects , 164 ( 9.4% )",
    "had an inverted spectra with slope steeper than @xmath11 and they were included in our starting list .",
    "we then inspected the nvss images to make sure that the component in the catalogue accounted for the whole flux density .",
    "the extended objects ( typically frii and a few fri or complex radio sources ) , resolved by the nvss but a single source in the 87 gb , were removed .",
    "our list of `` bright '' hfp candidates consisted of 103 sources . after a search for optical identification",
    "one source have been dropped , since it is associated with a planetary nebula ( ) , hence to a completely different physical phenomenon .",
    "therefore , the final list is made up with 102 ( 5.9% of the starting dataset ) candidates and is presented in table 1 : column 1 gives the j2000 name ; columns 2 and 3 provide the j2000 coordinates from the nvss catalogue ( very accurate positions can be found in the jodrell bank vla astrometric survey , jvas catalogue ; patnaik et al .",
    "@xcite , browne et al .",
    "@xcite , wilkinson et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; columns 4 , 5 and 6 report the flux densities in the nvss , 87 gb and jvas catalogues , respectively ; column 7 shows the spectral index between the nvss and the 87 gb ; column 8 reports whether the source belongs to other relevant samples ( see below ) ; columns 9 , 10 and 11 give the optical i d , magnitude and redshift ; finally column 12 provide the b1950 source name .",
    "we found 14 sources in common with the new gps candidate starting list in marecki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( m in column 8) , three objects are in the bright gps sample from stanghellini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( st ) , two sources in the faint gps sample from snellen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( sn ) .",
    "it has been useful to compare our list to the 550 compact extragalactic object in kovalev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( k ) , where nearly simultaneous radio spectra are available between 1 and 22 ghz .",
    "we searched our hfp candidates in the caltech - jodrell bank flat - spectrum sample ( taylor et al . @xcite and references therein ) ( pr , cj1 and cj2 ) and with the kellermann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ( k ) vlba survey at 15 ghz , in order to have images of the pc - scale radio morphology .",
    "finally most of our hfp candidates have very short snapshot images in the vlba calibrator survey ( vcs , peck & beasley @xcite ) .",
    "the optical i d ( capitals ) and redshift are from the ned database , when available .",
    "we also report our optical i d on the digitised red plates of the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) ( small g and s for extended or stellar ) when no other optical information is available ; a ? following the optical identification means that the classification is uncertain .",
    "we remark that the optical magnitudes , mostly from the ned database , reported in table 1 are not homogeneous ( i.e. in the same band ) .",
    "also variability plays an important role , given that a significant fraction of the sources are associated with blazars .",
    "in fact among the candidates there are also 3 bl lac objects from the 1 jy sample ( stickel et al .",
    "@xcite ) and a few other sources known to be variable .",
    "simultaneous multifrequency observations are necessary to remove flat spectrum variable sources from the sample ; in fact our selection criteria are based on two observations at 4.9 and 1.4 ghz taken a few years apart .",
    "variable sources that happened to be in a `` high '' activity state at the time of the 4.9 ghz observation are selected by our criteria , and need to be removed .",
    "hence , we have observed at the vla the whole `` bright '' sample .",
    "we carried out nearly simultaneous flux density measurements at l band ( with the two ifs at 1.365 and 1.665 ghz ) , c band ( 4.535 and 4.985 ghz ) , x band ( 8.085 and 8.485 ghz ) , u band ( 14.935 and 14.985 ghz ) and k band ( 22.435 and 22.485 ghz ) .",
    "the observing bandwidth was chosen to be 50 mhz per if except at 1.665 ghz , set to 25 mhz in order to avoid radio interference .",
    "each source was observed typically for 40 seconds at each frequency in a single snapshot , cycling through frequencies .",
    "this means that our flux density measurements are nearly simultaneous , given that they are separated by 1 minute apiece .    for each observing run",
    "we spent one or two scans on the two primary flux density calibrators or .",
    "secondary calibrators were observed for 1 minute at each frequency about every 25 minutes ; they were chosen aiming to minimise the telescope slewing time and therefore we could not derive accurate positions for the radio sources we observed .",
    "accurate positions can be obtained from the jvas catalogue ( patnaik et al .",
    "@xcite , browne et al .",
    "@xcite , wilkinson et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    information on the date and duration of the observing runs is summarised in table 2 .",
    "sources from the bright and faint samples were observed together in each run in order to optimise the observing schedule .",
    "the data reduction has been carried out following the standard procedures for the vla implemented in the nrao aips software .",
    "separate images for each if were obtained at l , c and x bands in order to improve the spectral coverage of our data .",
    "imaging has been quite complicated at l band since a number of confusing sources fall within the primary beam , and an accurate flux density measurement could be obtained only once the confusing sources had been cleaned out .",
    "generally one iteration of phase - only self - calibration have been performed before the final imaging . on the final image we perfomed a gaussian fit by means of the task jmfit , and also measured the source flux density with tvstat and imstat .",
    "generally all the hfp candidates were unresolved by the present observations ; when jmfit found some extension , it was generally much smaller than the beam size , and therefore we did not consider it .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "noise levels in the image plane is relevant only for measured flux densities of a few mjy , which is not the case for our sources ; in fact the major contribution comes from the amplitude calibration error .    at k band ,",
    "the antenna gain and atmospheric opacity vary significantly with elevation , introducing visible effects below @xmath12 , progressively reducing the correlated flux density .",
    "only two observing runs ( 19dec98 and 14jun99 ) had a few sources observed at low elevations .",
    "the flux densities were then readjusted by comparing the flux density of ( ) , a well known supposedly non variable gps source , observed in a run close in time .    at the end",
    ", we estimate that the overall amplitude error ( 1 sigma ) is 3% at l , c and x bands , 5% at u band and finally 10% at k band .",
    "we derived the spectral indices between any pair of adjacent frequencies , and then we classified the sources into two sets : 1 ) the genuine hfps , i.e. sources with peaked radio spectrum and at least a spectral index below -0.5 ( 55 objects ) 2 ) flat spectrum sources ( 48 ) . these objects with their flux densities",
    "are listed in table 3 and table 4 respectively , according to their classification .",
    "it is interesting to note that also among these genuine hfp sources , flux density variability is not uncommon ( see section 7.1 ) , and indeed 12 objects have flux densities below 300 mjy at 4.9 ghz , and at the time of our observations would have been dropped from the bright sample .",
    "our selection picked up also three well known gps sources , namely ( g ) , ( g ) and ( q ) ( stanghellini et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact",
    "their radio spectra peak between 4 and 10 ghz .    of the two gps sources in snellen",
    "( @xcite ) , turned out to be slightly below the 300 mjy limit , ( table 3 and figure 1 ) , while in our simultaneous data has a flat spectrum ( table 4 and figure 2 ) and therefore has been classified as a non - hfp source .    is a well known bl lac object from the 1jy sample ( stickel et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and it is classified as a hfp source .",
    "it was observed twice , and at both epochs the radio spectrum meets our selection criteria . another bl lac object ( ) has a genuine hfp radio spectrum .",
    "this confirms that it is possible that beamed radio sources like bl lac objects , or more generally blazars , posses radio spectra peaking above a few ghz , as the result of a self - absorbed synchrotron emission from the jet base . the sample of hfp sources presented here is therefore expected to collect a mixture of doppler boosted objects together with the young pregenitors of the gps - css population .",
    "the determination of the pc - scale morphology will be an important tool to distinguish among these two classes .",
    "it is interesting to analyse the the 23 sources in common with the kovalev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) list of compact extragalactic objects , given that they provide nearly simultaneous flux density measurements between 1 and 22 ghz , and our selection criteria can be applied in the same way . among the 16 sources we define genuine hfps only 11 are hfps in kovalev et al . , while 5 would have been classified as flat spectrum sources . on the other hand , among the remaining 7 non - hfps ,",
    "4 would be hfps ( , , and ) according to kovalev et al . measurements .",
    "this could be due to a progressive fall off of the radio spectrum at low frequencies , since the lowest frequency in kovalev et al .",
    "is about 40% lower than our , or to an effective variability in this class of sources , both in flux density and in spectral shape ( see also sect .",
    "we would like to remark that the bl lac object is a hfp source also in kovalev et al .",
    "there is no clear segregation on the fraction of hfps based on the optical identification .",
    "in fact the number of hfps versus total is 4/9 for galaxies , 23/36 for quasars , 2/8 for bl lacs , 16/32 for empty fields and 10/25 for objects with uncertain classification .",
    "the fractions of empty fields and identifications with an uncertain classification are still too large to allow a proper statistical analysis .",
    "an optical identification program is in progress at the 3.6 m telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) in la palma .",
    "we fitted the simultaneous radio spectra of the genuine hfp sources in table 3 in order to estimate the spectral peak and the turnover frequency .",
    "we first used the function reported as eq .",
    "( 1 ) in snellen et al . ( @xcite ) or eq . ( 2 ) in marecki",
    "( @xcite ) in which some assumptions about the physics in the radio sources are taken into account to derive the spectral shape .",
    "however , snellen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used the function only for determining the peak frequency , flux density peak and the full width half maximum of their fitted spectra .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the description of the radio spectrum in terms of a single homogeneous synchrotron component is too simplistic , and often the parameters derived from spectral peaks can be taken as gross estimates only .",
    "our simultaneous radio spectra have a much better sampling and more uniform uncertainties than in snellen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and marecki et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we tried a fit with the forementioned function , but we also fitted the radio data with a purely analytic function , with no physics behind , given it is used to determine only `` analytical '' quantities , namely the peak and the frequency at which it occurs . rearranging the parameters from kovalev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we used the following function :    @xmath13    from this fitting curve we derived the spectral peak ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , representing the actual maximum , regardless the point where the optical depth is unity , or any other physical measure . the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are purely numeric , and do not provide any direct physical information .    for two sources ( , first epoch , and ) we excluded the two flux densities at 1.365 and 1.665 ghz in order to have a good fit of the spectral peak .",
    "it is interesting to note note that the peak frequencies in our bright hfp sample are about a factor of 5 higher than in snellen et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and our spectra generally appear broader",
    ". we do not provide the fwhm of our fitted spectra since the range sampled by our simultaneous measurements is rather small , and very seldom the 22 ghz flux density falls below half the peak flux density , making the detemination of the width rather uncertain",
    ". we did not consider datapoints at low ( wenss , rengelink et al .",
    "@xcite ; texas , douglas et al .",
    "@xcite ) and high frequencies ( e.g. steppe et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) since one of the key point in the selection is the simultaneous measurements at the various frequencies .",
    "we remark further that only a few sources ( namely , , , and ) have flux densities still rising at 22 ghz , although all of them have slopes with a spectral index close to 0 .",
    "also the first epoch of has a spectral peak above 22 ghz ; this source indeed possess a rather unusual radio spectrum , and also show prominent variability in both flux density and spectral shape .",
    "in fact the peak flux does not change very much but the peak frequency moves from about 22 ghz down to 7.1 ghz in the second epoch ; the flux density at 5.0 ghz , close to the 87 gb , rises from 0.20 up to 0.51 jy .",
    "a spectral shape similar to the first epoch for has been found in , whose spectral peak is 0.58 jy at about 20 ghz , but its flux density at 4.9 ghz is only 0.27 jy , and therefore below the 87 gb limit .",
    "gps sources have steep optically thin radio spectra , and they are not as broad as found in the majority of our genuine hfps .",
    "we would need observations at higher frequencies in order to study the optically thin emission , and to disentangle the contamination by beamed objects , since we do expect that beamed objects are characterised by a dominant flat spectrum component ( on the pc scale ) , whose relative relevance increases with frequency .",
    "we compared the flux densities we measured with the values from the nvss at 1.4 ghz , from the 87 gb at 4.9 ghz and also from the jvas catalogue at 8.4 ghz , where all our candidates except and are included .",
    "we always considered our data at the closest frequency to that of the forementioned catalogues .",
    "the effects due to confusion are generally marginal since we can evaluate any contribution from confusing sources in the large beam of the 87 gb at 4.9 ghz from the nvss image and also from the vla image obtained from our data .",
    "only one case ( ) needs attention since there are two unresolved nvss sources separated by about 73 arcsec in p.a .",
    "@xmath18 , but within the 87 gb beam . by summing the two flux densities at 1.4 ghz , the spectral index with the 87 gb would have dropped the source out of the candidate sample ( @xmath190.43 ) .",
    "the 87 gb position lies in between the two nvss sources , at 35 arcsec from the southwestern one .",
    "however we decided to observe anyways this pair , since if one would have had a commonly steep spectrum , the other would have been inverted enough to be an hfp candidate .",
    "figure 3 displays the comparisons between our flux density measurements and those from the foremetioned catalogues .",
    "we distinguished among hfp and non - hfp sources by using filled or empty squares respectively .    at 1.4 ghz",
    "the data are evenly scattered around the 1:1 relation without any evidence for a different behaviour between the two classes of hfp and non - hfp sources . if we consider @xmath20 as the ratio between our flux density over the measure in the catalogue ( nvss , 87 gb or jvas ) at about the same frequency , we find that the median of the @xmath21 distribution is 0.99 for the 55 hfps and 0.94 for the 47 non - hfps .    at 4.9 ghz",
    "it is clear that , on average , the 87 gb flux densities exceed our measurements ; it is also evident that genuine hfp and non - hfp objects behave completely different , with the former nearly randomly scattered around the 1:1 relation ( the median of the @xmath22 distribution is 0.97 ) , and the latter generally well below ( the median is 0.51 ) .",
    "as mentioned in section 3 , this has to be expected since our selection criteria favours the inclusion of variable sources at a high state at the time of the 87 gb observation , and therefore it is natural to find non - hfp sources in the lower right part of the panel .    at 8.4 ghz",
    "the scenario is completely different , with the non - hfp sources generally weaker in our observations than in the jvas catalogue ( the median of @xmath23is 0.71 ) , but with the hfp sources @xmath24 ( median  =  1.16 ) .",
    "we should consider that the comparisons of the flux densities at 4.9 ghz might be somehow influenced by a different technique for the observation and by a totally different instrument , but it should not affect the class of ( point ) source observed .",
    "therefore the significantly different behavior between hfps and non - hfps is physically relevant .",
    "a proper statistical analysis will be carried out in a forthcoming paper where also the faint sample will be considered ( stanghellini et al .",
    "our constraints in declination and galactic latitude leave an area of 4.978 sr ; however the effective area where we have searched for cross identification between the 87 gb and the nvss is 4.825 sr , if we consider that 3.1% of the sources fall in regions where the nvss is not available as yet .",
    "we ended up with 55 genuine `` bright '' hfp sources and this gives a density of 11.4 sources per sr .",
    "we will discuss in more detail the source counts as a function of the limiting flux density after the selection of the `` faint '' hfp sample in order to span a wider flux density range , with a larger number of objects . in the framework of the `` youth '' model for css and gps radio",
    "sources the number of csss / gpss / hfps is related to the time they spend in each stage and to the variation of the total radio luminosity with time .",
    "it is therefore very likely that the number of hfp progenitors of gps sources is small , i.e. only a fraction of the `` bright '' hfp sources will indeed develop into gps and css stages . a further multifrequency radio observation , the determination of the vlbi structure , the optical identification and spectroscopy will be important tools to disentangle the intrisically young radio sources from the beamed objects .      we have derived estimates for the component size by assuming that the radio emission is originated in a single homogenous region , and that the source is in equipartition . following scott & readhead ( @xcite ) and assuming an injection index of 0.75 , we derive component sizes in the range from 0.3 to 3 mas . in a similar way we have estimated the source largest size ( ls ) from the relation between the source size ( considering the outer edges ) and the turnover frequency derived by odea ( @xcite ) for bright css and gps sources .",
    "the values obtained cover a range between a few mas to a few tens of mas .",
    "therefore , these objects would represent the extreme representatives of the gps population , being on average about one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "hence , in the framework of a radio source growing and expanding within the host galaxy , hfps would represent the very early stage .",
    "figure 3 , can also be used to test for flux density variability : it is rather evident that this phenomenon is common among hfp sources .",
    "this is also reinforced by the simultaneous radio spectra shown in figure 1 where often the nvss , 87 gb and jvas datapoints clearly stands out with respect to our measurements .",
    "further , a few sources have been observed twice or more in our runs , and the case of the forementioned is an example of significant variability in both spectral shape and flux density .",
    "if we assume that the spectral peak has moved from about 22 ghz down to 7.1 ghz as effect of pure expansion , the source component equipartition size would have increased by a factor of 2.9 from december 1998 to october 1999 ; assuming a redshift of 1.0 the size would have grown from 0.24 to 0.71 mas corresponding to 1.0 and 3.0 pc ( with @xmath25 km  s@xmath26mpc@xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , and leading to an expansion velocity of 15.6@xmath28 !",
    "this suggests / confirms either that a significant contamination of the hfp sample by beamed objects or that the sources are not in equipartition .",
    "other sources like , and only show flux density variability , without an appreciable peak frequency or shape change .",
    "finally other sources like , , , have turned out to have constant flux densities within the calibration errors . in particular ( alias or ) has an interesting history of decrease of its flux density by about 20% at cm wavelenghts in the eighties ( stanghellini et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but remained stable since then .",
    "all these results deserve a deeper investigation by means of a second vla multifrequency observation .",
    "we have presented a sample of 55 high frequency peakers , i.e. radio sources with radio spectra having their maxima at frequencies about an order of magnitude higher than known gps samples .",
    "this sample is intended to provide smaller and younger radio sources , but it is also likely to contain objects with properties different from the conventional css - gps class .",
    "further work is required to complete the optical identification and redshift determination , while further multifrequency polarimetric vla observations would provide useful insights to distinguish subclassed within our hfp sample",
    ". the determination of the pc - scale morphology will be a key point to distinguish between `` young '' and beamed objects .",
