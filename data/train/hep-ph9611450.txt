    "the analysis of large transverse energy ( @xmath2 ) jets produced in @xmath1 scattering with very small virtuality ( @xmath3 ) offers the possibility to learn about the partonic structure of real photons .",
    "the hard momentum scale @xmath2 allows the application of perturbative qcd to predict cross sections for the production of two or more high-@xmath2 jets .",
    "+ as is well known , in lowest order ( lo ) qcd two distinct processes contribute to the hard scattering cross sections . in the direct process , the incoming photon interacts in a point - like fashion with the quark from the proton via the qcd compton scattering @xmath4 or via the photon - gluon fusion process @xmath5 , if a gluon comes out of the proton . in the resolved process , the photon acts as a source of partons , which can scatter off the partons in the proton .",
    "therefore , the cross section for the resolved process depends on the parton distributions in the photon in addition to the parton distribution functions in the proton . +",
    "the two processes have distinctly different event structures . whereas the direct process results in events with a characteristic ( 2 + 1)-jet structure , i.e.  two high-@xmath2 jets and one low-@xmath2 remnant jet from the proton ,",
    "the resolved photon events have a characteristic ( 2 + 2)-jet structure , where in addition to the two high-@xmath2 jets and the low-@xmath2 proton remnant a second jet of low-@xmath2 fragments of the photon is produced . while in the ( 2 + 1)-jet events",
    "the total photon energy contributes to the hard scattering process , only a fraction participates in the ( 2 + 2)-jet events . +",
    "this characterization of the direct and resolved processes is valid only in lo . in next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
    ", the direct cross section may also have contributions with a photon remnant jet .",
    "in addition , both components are related to each other through the factorization scheme and scale at the photon leg .",
    "the dependence of the nlo direct cross section on this scheme / scale must cancel up to nnlo terms against the scheme / scale dependence of the resolved cross section .",
    "therefore in nlo both components must be considered together and consistently be calculated up to nlo in the parton distributions of the photon and the proton , respectively , and in the hard scattering cross sections .",
    "+ the simplest observable is the inclusive single - jet cross section .",
    "it depends on the transverse energy and the rapidity of the observed jet .",
    "complete nlo calculations for this cross section have been done previously @xcite and have been compared to experimental data from zeus @xcite and h1 @xcite . in these calculations",
    "special techniques for cancelling soft and collinear singularities have been applied , which are suitable only for the computation of inclusive single - jet cross sections . to obtain different cross sections , as for example the inclusive two - jet cross section , the whole calculation must be repeated .",
    "inclusive two - jet cross sections depend on one more variable .",
    "therefore they are a much more stringent test of the qcd predictions than inclusive single - jet cross sections .",
    "furthermore , for a comparison with experimental data the calculations must be performed in such a way that the experimental cuts can be built in easily . for this purpose ,",
    "the so - called phase space slicing method is suited particularly well . in this method ,",
    "an invariant mass resolution cut is introduced to isolate the soft and collinear singularities of initial and final states .",
    "this resolution cut is purely technical and is chosen small enough not to disturb any experimental constraints or jet recombination requirements .",
    "based on this method we recently calculated the inclusive two - jet cross section for direct photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the results of this calculation were compared with data from the zeus collaboration @xcite , in which the direct contribution and the resolved contribution were separated with a cut on @xmath6 , i.e.  the momentum fraction of the photon entering the hard scattering .",
    "the contribution of the resolved photon in the enriched direct @xmath7 sample was estimated in lowest order since it was supposed to contribute only a fraction in this sample . as a result of this investigation it turned out that the resolved contribution in the enriched direct @xmath7 sample was not negligible and",
    "could be , depending on the assumed photon structure function , as large as 30% of the total two - jet cross section .",
    "it is clear that the estimate of the resolved cross section in this region by a lo computation is insufficient and that the nlo corrections of the resolved cross section must be included .",
    "in addition , in the same analysis of the zeus two - jet data @xcite the inclusive two - jet cross section in an enriched resolved @xmath7 sample was measured , which could be a decisive test of the available parton distributions of the photon .",
    "for this reason and since we expect more two - jet experimental data in the future , a complete nlo calculation of the inclusive two - jet cross section is mandatory . for the direct component ,",
    "we rely on our previous work @xcite .",
    "the nlo calculation of the resolved component has been completed recently @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the calculation will be presented in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "here we shall only give a short presentation , report some results on various inclusive two - jet cross sections , which might be measured in the future , and recalculate the two - jet cross section in the enriched direct @xmath7 sample and the enriched resolved @xmath7 sample for a comparison with recent zeus data @xcite .",
    "+ the outline of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we explain the formalism used to calculate the inclusive two - jet cross section for the resolved part . in section 3 , we present some results in order to demonstrate the flexibility of our method and a comparison with recent zeus measurements .",
    "section 4 contains a summary .",
    "before we explain how the nlo corrections have been calculated , we must specify the relation between the @xmath1 and the @xmath8 cross sections .",
    "let us start with the electroproduction process @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are the four - momenta of the incoming and outgoing electron ( positron ) and the proton , respectively .",
    "@xmath13 denotes a generic hadronic system which will be specified later .",
    "@xmath14 is the momentum transfer of the electron to the photon with virtuality @xmath15 . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "the @xmath1 cross section can be calculated in the weizscker - williams approximation , where the @xmath8 cross section can be factorized and the photon spectrum is given by the function @xmath16 here , @xmath17 is the electron mass , and @xmath18 is the fraction of the initial electron energy transferred to the photon .",
    "the cross section for the process ( 1 ) @xmath19 is then given by the convolution @xmath20 @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are determined by the tagging conditions of the experiments at hera and will be specified when we present our numerical results . in ( 3 ) , d@xmath24 is the photoproduction cross section with initial photon energy @xmath25 and photon virtuality @xmath3 .      as we explained in the introduction , inclusive jet cross sections d@xmath26",
    "receive contributions from two components , direct and resolved , depending on the way in which the incoming photons participate in the hard scattering subprocesses . in the resolved case",
    ", the nlo inclusive two - jet cross section is calculated from the formula @xmath27 in ( 4 ) , @xmath2 is the transverse energy of the measured or trigger jet with rapidity @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 denotes the rapidity of another jet such that in the three - jet sample these two jets have the largest and second largest @xmath2 , i.e.  @xmath30 .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of ( 4 ) is the lo cross section , and the second term is the nlo correction .",
    "the latter depends on the factorization scales @xmath31 and @xmath32 at the photon and proton vertex , at which the initial state singularities are absorbed into the parton distribution functions of the photon and the proton .",
    "@xmath33 is the renormalization scale .",
    "the variable @xmath34 is the usual cone size parameter , which defines the size of the jets with transverse energy @xmath2 , rapidity @xmath35 , and azimuthal angle @xmath36 .",
    "when two partons fulfill the snowmass condition @xcite with the cone size parameter @xmath34 , they are combined into one jet .",
    "the same jet definition must be used in the analysis of the experimental data , if a meaningful comparison between theory and experiment is intended .",
    "it is clear that either of the two jets can consist of two partons inside a cone with radius @xmath34 .",
    "essentially the same formula applies for the direct cross section . in this case , the photon structure function @xmath37 is replaced by @xmath38 .",
    "+ the nlo corrections @xmath39 in ( 4 ) for the hard scattering subprocesses are calculated with the phase space slicing method using an invariant mass cut for the separation of the cross section for @xmath40 jets and @xmath41 jets .",
    "this invariant mass cut is defined by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the partonic center - of - mass energy squared .",
    "so , for example , in the resolved subprocess @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 can be identical or non - identical quarks , the cross section has soft , initial , and final state collinear singularities .",
    "the cross section d@xmath47 is integrated over these singular regions up to the cut - off @xmath48 , which isolates the respective singularities in terms of poles in @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the dimension in the dimensional regularization method .",
    "these singularities cancel against the singular contributions of the virtual corrections to @xmath51 and against the subtraction terms at the scales @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which are absorbed into the parton distribution functions of the photon and the proton , respectively .",
    "outside the cut - off region , i.e.  for @xmath52 , we have genuine @xmath53 final states .",
    "the cross section in this region is subdivided into the two - jet cross section and the three - jet cross section contribution , depending on whether two of the final state partons are combined according to the snowmass condition or not .",
    "the lo contribution , the nlo virtual contributions , and the nlo corrections inside the @xmath48-cut contribute to the two - jet cross section together with the contributions inside the recombination cone with radius @xmath34 .",
    "the part of the @xmath54 cross section not fulfilling the cone recombination condition is the three - jet cross section , from which we have calculated the inclusive two - jet cross section as a function of @xmath2 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . for the exclusive two - jet cross section , @xmath55 . to separate double singularities in the @xmath53 cross section part",
    "we have used the method of partial fractioning .",
    "the same partial fractioned expressions are applied for the calculation inside and outside the @xmath48-cut . inside the @xmath48-cut region , the integrations are done analytically with the approximation that terms @xmath56 are neglected .",
    "this is necessary since otherwise with a @xmath50-dimensional space - time the necessary integration could not be carried out . outside the @xmath48-cut region ,",
    "the contributions to the inclusive cross section are evaluated with no further approximations .",
    "because of the approximation in the analytic part inside the @xmath48-cut , the parameter @xmath48 must be chosen very small .",
    "it turned out that for @xmath48 of the order @xmath57 to @xmath58 the inclusive cross section is independent of the cut - off parameter @xmath48 .",
    "however , the inclusive two - jet cross section depends on the cone size @xmath34 , which must be chosen in accordance with the analysis of the experimental data . in the case of all the other hard subprocesses for the resolved cross section ,",
    "of which there are many and which will not be listed here , the calculation proceeds in the same way .",
    "the complete list will be given in a separate publication @xcite and can also be found in @xcite . in these references , the details of the analytic integrations and the cancellation of the singularities for nlo corrections is described as well . for the direct cross section , the calculation of the nlo correction was already reported and is given with all details in our previous work @xcite . + before the final results were obtained , some tests of the nlo corrections have been performed . for similar tests of the nlo corrections of the direct cross section",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the same tests were done for the resolved subprocesses .",
    "so we checked that the cross sections are independent of the cut - off @xmath48 if @xmath48 is chosen small enough .",
    "this was the case for @xmath59 in all considered cases under different kinematical conditions . for @xmath60 , we observed some small @xmath48 dependence caused by the approximations in the analytical integrations .",
    "second , the resolved inclusive one - jet cross section was calculated and compared with earlier results for which a completely different method for cancelling the infrared and collinear singularities was applied @xcite .",
    "very good agreement was found in all channels and for the total resolved cross section .",
    "third we tested that the sum of the nlo direct and the lo resolved cross section is independent of the factorization scale @xmath31 similar to such a test for the single - jet inclusive cross section earlier @xcite . details of these tests can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ for the calculation of the inclusive jet cross sections , we need the parton distributions @xmath61 of the photon and @xmath62 of the proton , respectively ( see ( 4 ) ) .",
    "we have chosen the nlo set of glck , reya , and vogt ( grv ) in the @xmath63 scheme for @xmath61 @xcite and the cteq3 m set , i.e.  also a @xmath63 set in nlo , for @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "all scales are set to @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 is calculated from the two - loop formula with @xmath66 massless flavors with @xmath67 mev , equal to the @xmath68-value of the cteq3 m parton distributions .",
    "the charm quarks are treated as light flavors with the boundary condition that the charm content of the two structure functions vanishes for @xmath69 , @xmath70 with @xmath71 gev .",
    "in this section we present some characteristic numerical results for two - jet cross sections concentrating on the resolved contribution .",
    "all results are obtained with the phase space slicing method . except where we compare with recent zeus data",
    ", we do not apply special cuts on kinematical variables of the initial or final states dictated by the experimental analysis , although this is necessary if one wants to confront the prediction with experimental data .",
    "therefore , the photon energy fraction @xmath72 in ( 2 ) is allowed to vary in the kinematically allowed range from @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 gev@xmath75 in ( 2 ) is the same as usually used in the jet analysis of the zeus experiment . +",
    "the further evaluation of the two - jet cross section is based on two separate contributions  a set of two - body contributions and a set of three body contributions .",
    "each set is completely finite , as all singularities have been cancelled or absorbed into structure functions in the same way as in the case of the direct cross section @xcite .",
    "each part depends separately on the cut - off @xmath48 .",
    "the analytic contributions are valid only for very small @xmath48 , since terms of @xmath56 have been neglected .",
    "for very small @xmath48 , the two contributions have no physical meaning . in this case , the terms depending on @xmath76 force the two - body contributions to become negative , whereas the three - body cross sections are large and positive . the resolved cross section shows a similar behavior @xcite . when the two- and three - body contributions are superimposed to yield the inclusive two - jet cross section ,",
    "the dependence on the cut - off will cancel .",
    "this will only be the case if the inclusive cross sections are defined in the correct way , so that they are infrared safe .",
    "we have checked this explicitly by varying @xmath48 in the superposition of the two pieces for the inclusive one - jet and two - jet cross section separately .",
    "for the two - jet cross section , it is essential that the variable @xmath2 is chosen in the way as stated above , namely that @xmath2 is the transverse momentum of the two largest @xmath2 jets .",
    "this means that the cut - off @xmath48 is purely technical .",
    "it only serves to distinguish the phase space regions , where the integrations are done analytically with arbitrary dimensions from those where they are done numerically in four dimensions .",
    "when one compares to experimental data with special kinematical cuts , @xmath48 must be chosen sufficiently small in order to make sure that the cuts on kinematical variables of the final state do not interfere with the cancellation of the @xmath48 dependence .",
    "+ for the recombination of two partons @xmath77 and @xmath78 with the cone constraint @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath82 are the rapidity and azimuthal angle of the recombined jet , we choose the radius @xmath83 . in some cases ,",
    "an ambiguity may occur when two partons @xmath77 and @xmath78 qualify both as two individual jets @xmath77 and @xmath78 and as a combined jet . in this case",
    "we only count the combined jet to avoid possible double counting .",

    "however , at @xmath94 this is no longer possible due to phase space restrictions .",
    "the @xmath29-distributions for resolved photons in fig .",

    "[ plot39 ] and [ plot40 ] . on the other hand , the proton structure can best be studied with direct photons , when the cross section is not folded with another distribution .",

    "furthermore , the zeus collaboration applied three different jet definitions : two variations of the cone algorithm @xcite are used which they called `` eucell '' and `` pucell '' .",
    "these algorithms treat seed finding and jet merging in different ways .",
    "in addition , the @xmath104 cluster algorithm `` ktclus '' @xcite for hadron - hadron collisions is used . in @xcite ,",
    "several versions of the @xmath104 algorithm have been introduced which left some flexibility about how the stopping condition and the recombination scheme can be implemented .",
    "a version which is particularly suitable to define jets for inclusive jet cross section measurements was emphasized in @xcite .",
    "it is also closest to the cone algorithms and states that two protojets @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( i.e.  two partons in the three parton final states ) are merged if @xmath105 and the recombination of the two protojets is done with the @xmath2 scheme as is usually also done in the cone algorithms @xcite .",
    "compared to the cone algorithm @xcite with @xmath103 , which was applied so far to generate the results in figs .  1 - 8 ,",
    "the two partons are merged if they are less than @xmath103 apart in @xmath106 space , whereas in the cone algorithm the merging condition is on the opening angle between either of the two partons and the jet center obtained from the @xmath2 recombination equations , i.e. @xmath107 and @xmath108 with @xmath83 and @xmath109 defined in equation ( 5 ) .",

    "this uncertainty is largest for the `` resolved '' cross section at @xmath129 gev and leads to a @xmath130 nb uncertainty in the cross section near @xmath131 @xcite . in the `` direct '' cross section , this energy scale uncertainty is smaller by a factor of two @xcite .",
    "+ in fig .",
    "[ plot10 ] , we observe that the nlo two - jet cross sections are somewhat smaller than the lo cross sections , which are included only to see the effect of the nlo corrections .",
    "these lo cross sections are independent of the jet definition , i.e.  are always the same for the cluster algorithm or a cone algorithm with any cone radius .",
    "they should not be compared to the experimental data since it is known that the two - jet cross sections depend on the jet definitions .",
    "the choice of the jet definition has an effect of about 25 - 30% in both data and theory in the `` direct '' cross section and of about 50% for the `` resolved '' cross section @xcite .",
    "differential cross sections d@xmath132/d@xmath2d@xmath28d@xmath29 have been calculated in nlo for direct and resolved photoproduction .",
    "infrared and collinear singularities are cancelled with the phase space slicing method using an invariant mass cut - off . with this method",
    "we are able to incorporate various cuts on the final state as used in the analysis of experimental data and to perform calculations for different choices of jet algorithms .",
    "numerical results for the two - jet inclusive cross sections at hera have been presented employing the usual snowmass cone algorithm for the jet definition . for a cone radius of @xmath83 , the nlo corrections lead to an increase of the order of 70% compared to the lo prediction in the resolved contribution and of the order of 20% in the direct case already presented earlier @xcite .",
    "+ using a particular version of the @xmath104 cluster algorithm @xcite , we calculated the cross section d@xmath133/d@xmath111 with cuts on @xmath122 to separate `` direct '' and `` resolved '' contributions as in the analysis of the zeus data @xcite .",
    "we find fairly good agreement with recent zeus data @xcite for the enriched direct @xmath7 sample .",
    "for the enriched resolved @xmath7 sample , the agreement is good in the larger @xmath2 region , @xmath134 gev . for smaller @xmath2 ( @xmath129 and 8 gev )",
    ", we find a discrepancy which we attribute to additional multi - parton interactions @xcite not incorporated in the theoretical calculations .",
