    "the study of lattice models with local ( gauge ) symmetry is interesting as it brings together several aspects of statistical mechanics and field theories @xcite .",
    "lattice models are a natural regularization for continuum field theory models in the sense that the lattice spacing acts as a cutoff . on the other hand , the introduction of the lattice spacing changes the problem to one of statistical mechanics .",
    "it becomes then relevant to analyze the phase diagram of the system and unveil their critical points .",
    "the enhancement of a global symmetry by a local one brings some obstacle concerning the existence of phase transitions .",
    "this is a consequence of the elitzur s theorem @xcite , which states that in a theory with local interactions and local gauge symmetry , the expectation value of non gauge invariant quantities must vanish . in other words , it states that local symmetries can not be spontaneously broken .    for concreteness ,",
    "let us consider the ising gauge model .",
    "there , the elitzur s theorem implies that the expectation value of the order parameter , the magnetization , must be zero since it is not gauge invariant .",
    "thus , the system can not magnetize and the existence of a phase transition is obscure . nonetheless , as showed by wegner @xcite , a phase transition occurs and it is detected not by an order parameter but rather by the behavior of a gauge invariant correlation function .",
    "moreover , the phase transition in this case can be interpreted as a condensation of topological objects ( kinks ) @xcite .",
    "let us analyze the above situation from the energetics perspective .",
    "the crucial point in the ising gauge model is that , even in the presence of an external field which breaks the gauge invariance , spin configurations related by a local gauge transformation differ only by a finite amount of energy .",
    "essentially , the gauge symmetry makes the expectation value of non invariant quantities , like the order parameter , insensitive to all degrees of freedom except small neighbors sites ( this is in contrast with the usual ising model with global symmetry , where all spins cooperate to break the symmetry ) .",
    "this finite number of degrees of freedom is not strong enough to break the local symmetry and consequently there is no magnetic phase transitions .",
    "that analysis signs that the situation can be drastically different when we have an infinity number of degrees of freedom at each site or link of the lattice .",
    "this occurs for example in systems with internal symmetries , generally characterized by a number @xmath2 of copies of certain variable at each site or link ( the same is true for continuum theories ) . if @xmath2 tends to infinity , the above analysis is no longer applicable .",
    "for example , consider the potts model of @xmath3 states with a local discrete symmetry . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", there is a spontaneous breaking of the local symmetry for @xmath4 .",
    "in addition , a number studies involving the large @xmath2 limit in different systems have been reported showing the spontaneous breaking of discrete as well as continuous local symmetries @xcite .",
    "our intention here is to pursue these ideas through the study of a quantum system of spherical spins with a continuous local symmetry .",
    "specifically , we construct a gauge invariant version of the ferromagnetic quantum spherical model with short - range interactions between first neighbors and explore some consequences .",
    "we follow an approach in which only the spatial part is discretized , i.e. , defined on a hypercubic lattice , while the time is maintained as a continuum variable parameterizing the quantum dynamics of the system .",
    "the spin variables , treated as matterfields ( not as gauge fields ) , are attached to the sites of the lattice .",
    "the auxiliary gauge fields are defined as usual on the links between the sites .",
    "we show that the model exhibits nontrivial classical and quantum phase transitions , corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of the local symmetry , and determine the critical dimensions .",
    "we also discuss the mechanism of dynamical generation of the gauge fields , where auxiliary gauge degrees of freedom become dynamical ( physical ) ones when the system is quantized .",
    "this turns out to be related to the restoration of the local symmetry . as by - product",
    ", this analysis unveils some similarities with the @xmath0 model which is shown to be concretized in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the sec .",
    "ii , we discuss some basics properties of the quantum spherical model . sec .",
    "iii is dedicated to the construction of the model with the local symmetry .",
    "the evaluation of the partition function and the analysis of the critical behavior are subject of the section iv . in sec .",
    "v , by computing the two point correlation function of the gauge field , we verify that a maxwell term for the gauge field is generated in the continuum limit .",
    "the equivalence with the @xmath0 model is shown in sec .",
    "a summary and additional comments are presented in the sec .",
    "there is also an appendix with some auxiliary calculations .",
    "before considering the gauge generalization , let us discuss briefly some basic aspects of the spherical model , starting with the classical version and following the steps toward its quantization .",
    "since its conception , the classical spherical model @xcite has been extensively used in statistical mechanics as a prototype model to investigate several properties of the critical behavior @xcite .",
    "one of its appealing features is that it is a non mean - field model exactly soluble .",
    "its quantum counterparts @xcite share these features , providing a framework to investigate the presence of quantum fluctuations in a variety of situations @xcite .    the classical model is defined by attaching classical continuous spinvariables @xmath5 to each site @xmath6 of a @xmath7-dimensional hypercubic lattice , interacting according to the hamiltonian @xmath8 which is a kind of continuous approximationof the ising model .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath9 depends only on the distance between the sites @xmath6 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is an external field .",
    "the spin variables are subject to the spherical constraint @xmath13 being @xmath14 the total number of lattice sites .",
    "when there is homogeneity in the spins , this condition is equivalent to @xmath15 , as in the ising model .    in order to quantize the model we have to introduce a dynamics to the system",
    "this can be done by adding a kinetic term to the hamiltonian ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "if we choose the kinetic term to be quadratic in the conjugated momentum to @xmath16 , we obtain the following lagrangian in the absence of the external field @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the quantum coupling . note that a term with only one derivative like @xmath19 has no effect since it is just the derivative of the constraint @xmath20 ( this is not the case when the spins are complex , as we shall see ) .",
    "now we can proceed with quantization by means of the path integral . in the imaginary time formalism",
    ", we need to pass to the euclidean imaginary time @xmath21 , with @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath23 being the inverse of the temperature .",
    "furthermore , the bosonic variables are required to satisfy the periodic boundary condition @xmath24 .",
    "the partition function is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the euclidean form of the lagrangian ( [ 1.3 ] ) .",
    "the integration measure @xmath27 symbolically stands for functional integration over the spins variable of all sites of the lattice , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "this partition function can be evaluated via the saddle point method , which becomes exact in the thermodynamic limit . from the saddle point condition we can determine the critical behavior of the model and ,",
    "in particular , check that the model has a nontrivial critical behavior , exhibiting classical and quantum phase transitions @xcite .",
    "an interesting aspect of the quantum spherical model is its connection to the @xmath29 nonlinear sigma model , involving @xmath2 scalar fields @xmath30 , @xmath31 , with the constraint @xmath32 and the lagrangian @xmath33 where we are omitting the sum over @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , the continuum limit of the quantum spherical model with short - range interactions , where the fourier transform of the interaction behaves as @xmath35 , is equivalent to the large @xmath2 limit , @xmath1 , of the nonlinear sigma model @xcite .",
    "now let us consider the case where the spins are complex variables , denoted by @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the complex conjugated ) .",
    "the spherical constraint becomes @xmath38 and the lagrangian ( [ 1.3 ] ) is generalized to @xmath39 we see that the lagrangian as well as the constraint are invariant under global phase transformations , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with @xmath42 constant . in addition to its intrinsic interest ,",
    "this model is of relevance for the study of superconductivity , since it can be viewed as a spherical approximation for the hamiltonian describing a josephson junction array system @xcite .",
    "a natural step to further generalize the lagrangian ( [ c1.1 ] ) is to require the invariance under local phase transformations of the spins . with this ,",
    "our purpose here is not only to enlarge the present theoretical framework as making wider the range of applications . in the remaining of this paper",
    "we discuss the construction of a lagrangian with that gauge symmetry and explore some consequences .    before closing this section ,",
    "note that in the case of complex spins there is the possibility for introducing the dynamics in a different way @xcite , with a kinetic term involving only one time derivative that was not possible in the case of real spins .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath43 which is also invariant under global phase transformations of the spins .",
    "higher order time derivatives ( higher than two derivatives ) generally yield to non unitary quantum evolution .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ c1.1 ] ) is invariant only under global phase transformations of the spins .",
    "we discuss now its generalization to include invariance under local phase transformations in the case of ferromagnetic short - range interactions , i.e. , when the interaction term reduces to @xmath44 involving only first - neighbors interactions , with @xmath45 . in the last term",
    ", @xmath34 is the lattice spacing and @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , is a set of orthogonal unit vectors along all directions , @xmath48 the local phase transformations are given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is an arbitrary real function of the lattice .",
    "the spherical constraint @xmath51 is automatically gauge invariant .    in order to motivate the necessary modification of the term ( [ 1.5 ] ) , let us rewrite it in a convenient way . in the continuum limit ,",
    "@xmath52 , we have @xmath53 the modulus square term of the spin without derivatives is already invariant . on the other hand",
    ", the term involving derivatives can be turned invariant by replacing the ordinary derivatives @xmath54 by covariant derivatives @xmath55 .",
    "thus , for an object @xmath56 transforming as @xmath57 , the covariant derivative of this object is constructed such that its transformation is @xmath58 .",
    "this guarantees that any function of the modulus @xmath59 is gauge invariant .",
    "we expect that the right hand side of ( [ 1.6b ] ) is generalized as @xmath60 we need to construct a lattice covariant derivative @xmath61 , such that the continuum limit reproduces the usual one . to this end , let us introduce the complex link variable @xmath62 , with the transformation law @xmath63 thus , it is easy to realize that a covariant derivative defined as @xmath64 has the desired transformation property , i.e. , @xmath65 . as will be clear in the following , it is convenient to require the links variable to satisfy @xmath66 thus we can write @xmath62 in terms of a real field @xmath67 @xmath68 from the transformation ( [ 1.7 ] ) we see that @xmath67 @xmath69 that , in the continuum limit , is the usual transformation of the gauge field , @xmath70 .",
    "we have to check now that in the continuum limit the lattice covariant derivative ( [ 1.8 ] ) reproduces the usual one . by taking the limit @xmath52 and expanding @xmath71",
    ", we obtain the correct result @xmath72 in this way , the contribution for the lagrangian of the form @xmath73 satisfies the requirements of gauge invariance , hermiticity , and the correct continuum limit which is consistent with ( [ 1.6c ] ) .",
    "when summed in @xmath6 and @xmath74 , the two last terms become additive constants due the constraint ( [ 1.6 ] ) and can be discarded .",
    "the last step is to analyze the kinetic term .",
    "as the time is a continuous variable , the generalization is in terms of usual covariant derivatives @xmath75 where the @xmath76 is the time component of the gauge field , with the transformation @xmath77 . of course",
    ", the gauge transformation must involve a time - dependent arbitrary function @xmath78 .",
    "collecting all the results , we conclude that the lagrangian @xmath79 together with the spherical constraint ( [ 1.6 ] ) define a u(1 ) gauge - invariant generalization of the short - ranged quantum spherical model .",
    "note that by taking the limits @xmath76 and @xmath80 or , equivalently , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , we recover the model ( [ c1.1 ] ) for the case of short - range interactions .    as the lagrangian ( [ 1.15 ] ) does not involve dynamical terms for the gauge fields @xmath76 and @xmath67 , they can be eliminated by means of their equations of motion .",
    "notice that the fields @xmath76 and @xmath67 have a very different status in the lattice formulation .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath76 is @xmath83 where @xmath84 , and the equation of motion of @xmath67 is @xmath85 plugging back these equations into the lagrangian ( [ 1.15 ] ) , we find the clumsy form @xmath86 + j\\sum_{{\\bf r},i}|\\bar{z}_{{\\bf r}+a\\,{\\bf e}_i}z_{\\bf r}| , \\label{1.15c}\\ ] ] in addition to the constraint ( [ 1.6 ] ) .",

    "we will be able to find how the parameters @xmath112 , and @xmath113 are related in the proximity of the critical point .",

    "thus , the nontrivial critical behavior occurs for dimension @xmath136 , while the mean field behavior occurs for @xmath137 .    the shift of the critical dimensions in one unit when we compare the cases of zero and finite temperatures can be understood by considering the way that the dynamics was introduced in the system , which is characterized by the dynamical critical exponent @xmath138 .",
    "we added a kinetic term involving two time derivatives , corresponding to a factor of @xmath139 in the momentum space . on the other hand , near the critical point",
    "the dominating power of momentum in the frequency @xmath140 is quadratic implying that the scaling factor between space and time is weighted by @xmath141 . according to the general scaling analysis , the quantum critical point of the model in @xmath7 dimensions is equivalent to the critical point of the @xmath142-dimensional model at finite temperature , which means that in our case the critical dimensions at the finite and zero temperature cases differ by a factor of @xmath141 .",
    "moreover , the equal status of space and time coordinates ( @xmath141 ) is an evidence of a relativistic structure underlying the model which can manifest in some specific limit .",
    "in fact , this will give rise to a relativistic emergent field theory in the continuum limit , as we will discuss later .",
    "we show now that it is possible to introduce an order parameter which is not gauge invariant , characterizing so a spontaneous breaking of the local symmetry .",

    "let us consider the case of finite temperature but the same reasoning goes for the case of zero temperature ( we just need to replace @xmath144 by @xmath18 in the arguments ) .",
    "above the critical temperature , the order parameter vanishes in the absence of the external field while it acquires a nonzero value below the critical temperature even in the absence of external field .",
    "we can see this by considering the partition function ( [ 1.16 ] ) in the presence of a constant external field @xmath12 which breaks the local symmetry , i.e. , with the coupling @xmath145 in the lagrangian .",
    "this will imply an additive term proportional to @xmath146 in the free energy @xmath147 and an additive term proportional to @xmath148 in the saddle point condition ( [ 1.23 ] ) .",

    "[ int ] , the spontaneous breaking of the local symmetry is the reflex of an infinite number of degrees of freedom cooperating to form an ordered state .",

    "this shows that a gauge invariant kinetic term for the gauge field is induced by quantum corrections , meaning that the auxiliary gauge degrees of freedom in the classical theory become physical degrees of freedom in the quantized theory .",

    "the dynamical generation of the gauge field is a signal of the restoration of local symmetry .",
    "this in accordance with the results of reference @xcite .",
    "all the similarities between the continuum limit of the quantum spherical model with gauge symmetry and the field theoretical @xmath0 model become concrete in the large @xmath2 limit , @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , as we shall discuss in this section , these two models turn out to be equivalent in the specified limits .",
    "to show the equivalence , we compare the partition function of the @xmath0 model with that one of the gauged quantum spherical model .",
    "this is the extension of the equivalence between the quantum spherical model and the nonlinear sigma model mentioned in the end of the sec .",
    "[ secqsm ] .    for completeness , we now review briefly some basic ingredients of the @xmath0 model .",
    "the complex projective coset space @xmath0 is defined by @xmath202 and can be parametrized in terms of @xmath2 complex fields @xmath203 satisfying the local constraint @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the coupling constant , such that the points @xmath93 and @xmath206 are identified , i.e. , @xmath207 .",
    "this identification is translated into the field theory as a gauge invariance @xmath208 .",
    "we can immediately write down a gauge invariant lagrangian for the @xmath93-field as @xmath209 with the covariant derivative given by @xmath210 .",
    "the sum over the number of fields is implicity and the model has both global @xmath211 and local @xmath212 symmetries .",
    "classically , @xmath213 is an auxiliary field and can be completely eliminated by means of its equation of motion .",
    "the @xmath0 model exhibits several interesting properties and has been intensively studied by a number of authors ( see for example @xcite and the references therein . see also @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the dynamical generation of gauge fields in this model was initially studied in @xcite .",
    "consider the zero temperature partition function .",
    "we introduce a delta function enforcing the constraint ( [ em2 ] ) and use its integral representation to integrate out the complex @xmath93-field .",
    "the result is @xmath214 .",
    "the effective action admits an expansion in powers of @xmath215 , @xmath216 to make sense of this expansion in the large @xmath2 limit we shall impose @xmath217 , which gives us the gap equation @xmath218 by integrating over the @xmath219 component , this equation can be compared with ( [ zt1 ] ) after an appropriate identification between the parameters .",
    "alternatively , we can write ( [ em9 ] ) by taking into account the temperature , which means that we need to replace @xmath220 after performing the sum over the integers @xmath221 we recover ( [ 1.23 ] )",
    ". finally , when we take the limit @xmath1 , only the quadratic terms will remain in ( [ ex1 ] ) , @xmath222=s^{(2)}[\\lambda]+s^{(2)}[a]$ ] .",
    "the quadratic part in the gauge fields is @xmath223=\\int \\frac{d^dp}{(2\\pi)^d } a_{\\mu}(p)\\pi^{\\mu\\nu}(p)a_{\\nu}(-p ) , \\label{em10}\\ ] ] with @xmath224 as in ( [ d7 ] ) , showing that the gauge contribution to the effective action coincides with that one of the quantum spherical model .",
    "we still have to discuss the equivalence in the @xmath225-sector . the fundamental difference in this sector",
    "is the dependence of the lagrange multipliers enforcing the constraints in these theories . in the case of the quantum spherical model , due to the nonlocal nature of the constraint",
    ", the lagrange multiplier depends only on the time . on the other hand , in the @xmath0 model",
    ", the local character of the constraint implies that the lagrange multiplier depends on the time as well as on the spatial coordinates .",
    "so the equivalence between the partition functions is reached after we integrate out the respective @xmath225-fields with the results evaluated at the saddle point , @xmath226 and @xmath198 .",
    "as the functional dependence is the same in both cases ( with appropriate comparison in the euclidean or minkowski space ) we conclude that the both partition functions become the same .",
    "to sum up , the continuum limit of the partition function of the quantum spherical model with the gauge symmetry is equivalent to that one of the @xmath0 in the limit @xmath1 .",
    "in this work we have constructed a version of the quantum spherical model which is invariant under local phase transformations of the complex spins , aiming to investigate the existence of phase transitions .",
    "as we stressed , this is a delicate question in view of the elitzur s theorem .",
    "the model was exactly solved in thermodynamic limit by means of the saddle point method . by analyzing the properties of the saddle point equation we showed that the model indeed exhibits a nontrivial ( non mean - field ) phase transition in both cases of zero and finite temperatures , corresponding to a spontaneous breaking of the local symmetry characterized by a non invariant order parameter .",
    "this is understood due to an infinite number of degrees of freedom cooperating to form an ordered state even in the theory with gauge invariance .    by computing the two point correlation function for the gauge fields in the continuum limit we verified that a maxwell - type kinetic term is generated for the gauge field .",
    "moreover , we concluded that the appearance of a dynamical gauge field is associated to the restoration of the gauge invariance above the critical coupling .",
    "the model was also shown to be equivalent to the limit @xmath1 of the relativistic @xmath0 model by comparing the quantum effective actions in both cases .    as a lateral remark",
    ", we point the difficulty in implementing the local symmetry in the model ( [ c1.2 ] ) following the lines described in the sec .",
    "this is so because the classical equation of motion for the auxiliary field @xmath227 implies @xmath228 , which seems to be an inconsistency .",
    "further investigations of the gauge invariant quantum spherical model naturally asks for applications .",
    "at least as an approximation for certain physical problems , it can be used as a prototype model .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of different types of interactions , for example , second neighbors in a competing way ( anti - ferro ) could produce a richer phase structure including lifishitz points .",
    "it is tempting to seek for a field theory equivalence in this case .",
